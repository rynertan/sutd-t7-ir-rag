# Solar heating panels.

## Abstract
A solar heating panel comprises a conduit 2, 3, 4, 5 for carrying a working fluid 6 , such as water, for heating by solar radiation energy. The surface of the conduit facing the sun has a highly reflecting surface 13 and therefore emits little thermal radiation. The reflecting surface may be a polished conduit surface or a layer of aluminium foil fixed on the conduit. Covering the reflecting surface 13 is a coating 14 of a material absorbing to visible radiation and transpa rent to thermal radiation. This coating 14 may be a layer of hard carbon 18 deposited by glow discharge or a semicon ductor such as germanium or silicon in the form of particles in a plastics matrix. Alternately the coating 14 may be a layer of germanium or silicon 17 covered with a thin hard carbon layer 18 both layers 17, 18 being arranged to form an anti reflection coating at visible wavelengths.

## Description
EMI1.1 SOLAR HEATING PANELS This invention relates to solar heating panels.Such panels commonly comprise two spaced plates between which water flows to be heated by radiant energy from the sun. In order to absorb energy the outside cf the plates are coated with a black paint. Unfortun ely although black surfaces absorb visible radiation they are efficient radiators of thermal, infra red radiation.An object of this invention is to provide a solar panel which absorbs visible radiation with low emission of thermal radiation.According to this invention a solar heating panel comprises a conduit through which a working fluid may pass for heating by radiation energy from the sun characterised in that the outside of the conduit has a highly reflecting surface covered with a thin layer which is absorbent to visible radiaticn, and transparent to thermal radiation,The thin layer may be a composite layer comprising a first layer of an infra red transparent material such as germanium or silicon next to the reflectinc Payer and a second layer of hard diamond like carbon coating the composite layer forming an anti reflection coating at visible wave lengths. An additional very thin layer of oxide may be formed on the conduit to assist bonding of the germanium or silicon. Alternatively the thin layer may be a single layer of glassy hard carbon or a semiconductor material in the form of particles held in a plastic matri such as polypropolene or polyethylene. The semiconductor material may be silicon, or germanium or other material having a band gap of 2 5 electron volts.The conduit may be pipes, or spaces between plates which may be flat or corrugated.The working fluid may be water protected with anti freeze additives or any other suitable fluid.The highly reflecting surface may be a layer or aluminium, copper, silver, gold, chrone, or any other infra red reflecting material foil and may be glued to the outside of the conduit. klternatively the conduit may be polished or have a reflecting layer painted or evaporated thereon. The composite layer may be of germanium or silicon followed by glassy diamond like carbon preferably deposited by a radio frequency RF or direct current OC glow discharge r techni ues in layer of about 1 m of germanium and 0.08 im carbon .The invention will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 shows a sectional view of a solar panel heating a domestic hot water cylinder, and Figure 2 shows apparatus for applying a carbon layer to material.As shown in Figure 1 a solar heating panel 1 comprises two plates 2, 3 spaced apart by end pieces 4, 5. Waster 6 contained between the plates is connected by an outlet pipe 7 to a heat exchange coil 8 in a domestic hot water cylinder 9. From the coil 8 the water is passed through a pipe 10, a pump 11, and an inlet pipe 12 back into the solar panel 1. On the upper surface of plate 3 is a highly reflecting layer of aluminium foil 13 which may be glued to the plate 3. The foil 13 is coated with a composite layer 14 comprising a 1 lem thick layer of germanium 17 and a 0.08 e thick layer 18 oX hard carbon.Spaced trom the layer 14 is a glass sheet 15 to protect the remainder of the panel 1 and to prevent heat loss by conduction.In operation visible or near infra red radiation from the sun passes through the glass 15 and is absorbed mostly in the germanium layer 17.This raises the temperature of the layer 14, and consequently the foil 13, plate 3 and water 6. Thus heated the hot water 16 is circulated, by the pump 11, through heating coil where it heats water in the cylinder 9.Radiation of energy from the panel 1 is prevented as follows. The layer 14 is absorbent to visible radiation. Furthermore, because the layers 17, 18 thickness and refractive indexes are arranged to provide an anti reflection in the visible wavelength range coating on the polished surface 13, little visible radiation is reflected, thereby increasing the energy absorption of the layer 14. At longer, infra red, wavelenfflths te germanium and carbon are transparent and hence the emission of infra red radiation is governed by the reflecting layer 13. Since a highly reflecting layer emits little radiation very little infra red radiation passes through the layer 14. Insulation 16 on the rear of the panel and all exposed pipe work 7, 10, 12 prevents heat loss at other parts of the system.As an alternative to a layer of aluminium foil 13, a reflecting layer may be painted, sprayed, or evaporated onto the plate 3. Alternatively the plate 3 may be highly polished.Apparatus for coating the foil 13, or any suitable reflecting surface, with germanium and carbon is shown in Figure 2. A specimen 20 to be coated is placed in an air tight metal container 21 which is then Os evacuated by a vacuum pump 22 to about 10 5 Torr A gas such as germane is continuously bled into the container 21 and the pressure maintained at about 10 Torr. by throttling the pump 22. The container 21 is connected to earth 23 whilst the specimen 20 is connected 24 through an insulated connector 25 to a 700 volts D.C.supply. As a result ionisation of the gas takes place with consequential dissociation of germanium and hydrogen atoms. Germanium ions impinge onto the heated specimen 20 to form a layer 17, having a time SS endent thickness.Alternatively the germanium may be sputtered or deposited by other processes. For example a 1 m thick layer is formed in about 50 minutes. The glow discharge process is repeated using a hydrocarbon gas such as methane or propane to deposit a 0.08 nn thick carbon layer 18. The layer 17, 18 thickness is calculated to provide an anti reflecting coating 14 such that the carbon germanium sandwich provides maximum absorption of solar radiation. As an alterrstive to D.C. glow discharge RF glow discharge may be used.In this technique the D.C. supply of Figure 2 is replaced by an RF supply at 13 kHz frequency supplied through a capacitor 26 developing a cathode potential of about 700 volts. Operating conditicns are as for D.C. operation. The specimen 20 of Figure 2 may be a sheet of aluminium foil several metres long and wound from one roller to another whilst submitted to the bombariment of germanium and hydrogen ztoms which causes a geranium layer to grow onto the exposed foil between the rollers. This is repeated to grow a carbon layer.A layer of silicon instead of germanium may be grown using the gas silane.Alternatively the silicon may be deposited using sputtering or other techniques.For some polished surfaces a very thin oxide layer may be deposited or grown first to enhance bonding of the germanium or silicon. For some applications the layer 17 of germanium or silicon may be omitted. In tolls case visible light is absorbed in the 0.5 to 10 m typically 1 . thick black coloured carbon layer 18 but not so efficiently as for the anti reflecting composite layer described above.As before a very thin bonding layer of oxide may be applied to the highly reflecting surface.
