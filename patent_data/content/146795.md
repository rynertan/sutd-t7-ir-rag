# An ejection nozzle for high pressure cleaning units.

## Abstract
Normally, an ejection nozzle with apistol grip valve and two nozzle tubes protuding from there to a narrow high pressure nozzle and a wide low pressure nozzle are used for high pressure cleaning units. In the tube leading to the low pressure nozzle, a shut off valve is provided, said nozzle being closed when spraying through the ejection nozzle. In the invention, both the two nozzles and the shut off valve are incorporated in a single nozzle unit, which only requires a single inlet tube 2 . This tube terminates in a high pressure nozzle opening 10 , but a wide side duct 12 is provided in front of this opening, said duct feeding the water out to an annular chamber, from where it can flow out through an annular outlet 60 around the high pressure nozzle after an operational sliding movement of the external cylindrical part 6 proper of the nozzle unit. Around and in front of the annular outlet 60 , a cylindrical jacket is disposed, said jacket having a transverse wall 26 forwardly spaced from the high pressure nozzle 10 . In the said wall, a wider ejection opening 44 is provided coaxially with it, said opening constituting the low pressure nozzle. In shifting the cylindri cal part 6 the opposite way, the annular outlet 60 is closed, so that ejection only takes place through the high pressure nozzle 10 out through the wider low pressure nozzle opening 44 . The cylindrical part 6 has an external rotatable jacket 54 which is controllably connected with a couple of lip plates 46 placed in front of the low pressure nozzle, said plates acting so as to impart a fan shape to the ejected jet, so that the cylindrical part 6 can moreover be operated for adjusting the fan width of the jet.
