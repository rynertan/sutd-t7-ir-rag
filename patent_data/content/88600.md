# Calcium aluminium alloys and process for their preparation.

## Abstract
A substantially homogeneous calcium aluminium alloy having a calcium aluminium atomic ratio of from about 60 40 to 80 20 and with useful and unexpected properties of brittle ness, passivity to atmospheric moisture and low volatility is prepared by a process which comprises adding aluminium under an inert atmosphere to molten calcium at a temperature of from about 550 to 1100 C and at a rate to prevent substan tial solids formation in the melt during the addition. The molten alloy is converted to particulate solid either by melt atomization or by casting, crushing and grinding. Lead calcium aluminum and tin calcium aluminum alloys are prepared by adding the calcium aluminum alloy to the molten lead or tin, while cal cium aluminum lithium alloy is prepared by adding lithium to the molten calcium aluminum alloy.
