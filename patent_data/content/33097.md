# Isolating and temperature compensating system for crystal resonators.

## Abstract
A mounting structure for crystal resonators 20 used as frequency standards and transducers which maximizes per formance and reduces the sensitivity to environmental errors. In one embodiment, force sensitive crystal resonators 10, 90, 108 having inherent unmounted temperature sensitivities are used in conjunction with reactive spring like mounting arrangements 62, 82, 94, 106, 114 having predetermined temperature stress characteristics such that the thermally induced mechanical stress of the mounting arrangements changes, compensates, and optimizes the overall combined temperature characteristics. In another embodiment crystal resonators 70, 132 are isolated from the external environment so that they are capable of sensing forces while operating in a vacuum or inert atmosphere. Environmental isolation is pro vided by bellows and or diaphragm arrangements 78, 124, 126 used alone or in conjunction with air tight enclosures 82, 134 which enable forces to be applied to stress sensitive crystals 70, 132 while isolating the crystals from the external force producing environment.
