# Epicyclic nozzle drive, an orbital nozzle unit and a hydraulic cleaning head incorporating the same.

## Abstract
There is provided a drive for an orbital nozzle 42 comprising a housing 2 having a fluid inlet and containing a fluid driveable impeller 18 from which the fluid, in use of the drive, flows through a passage within the housing 2 , epicyclic rotary speed reducing mechanism 5 in the housing 2 , an output shaft 7 driven by the epicyclic at speed reduced below the impeller speed, a means driveable by the output shaft mounting the nozzle for rotation, including means for delivering fluid from the passage to the nozzle 42 , as well as an orbital nozzle unit which incorporates such a drive and a hydraulic cleaning head which incorporates such a drive or orbital nozzle unit.
