## Description
ABRASION RESISTAJ1T p ME,THYLSTYRENE BUTADIEtlE RUBBER This invention is directed to copolymers of p methylstyrene with butadiene which produce rubbers having high abrasion resistance. Styrene butadiene rubber SBR is a well known synthetic rubber widely used in tire manufacture. It is the discovery of this invention that a rubber containing p methylstyrene instead of styrene, when compounded and cured, has abrasion resistance significantly greater than SBR compound. This can increase tire tread mileage. Insofar as is now known it has not been proposed to manufacture synthetic rubber from p methylstryene. In British Patent No. 582,571, there is disclosed a copolymer of butadiene with a material called para methyl styrene . This material is characterized as being unable to be homopolymerized and is stated to be only 57 pure. This material can not be the high purity p methylstyrene used by the present inventor, because his material is readily homopolymerizable. This invention provides a rubber comprising a copolymer of p methylstyrene and butadiene containing between about 75 and about 60 , by weight, butadiene and between about 25 and about 40 , by weight, of p methylstyrene. One monomer used in preparing the copolymer rubbers of this invention is p methylstyrene. It is within the contemplation of this invention to use mixtures of methylstyrene rich in p methylstyrene. Such mixtures contain at least 95 weight percent, preferably 97 99 weight percent, p methylstyrene and less than 0.1 weight percent o methylstyrene with the balance being m methylstyrene. A typical mixture contains, by weight, about 95 percent p methylstyrene, about 5 percent m methylstyrene, and about 0.05 percent o methylstyrene.The mixtures are obtained by catalytic dehydrogenation of the mixtures of ethylmethyl benzene isomers described in U.S. Patent No. 4,086,287 to which reference is made. The other monomer is butadiene, a well known and commercially available diolefin. Generally, the copolymer rubber contains about 3 parts by weight butadiene and about one part by weight p methylstyrene.In terms of weight percent, the copolymer will contain between about 25 and about 40 p methylstyrene and between about 75 and about 60 butadiene. The copolymer rubber is prepared using well known emulsion polymerization methods and techniques.The comonomers are emulsified in water using emulsifying agents. Typical emulsifying agents are sodium oleate, sodium stearate, sulfonated fatty acids, saponin, and aryl sulfonic acids. Catalysts generally are free radical initiators or oxidizing agents, such as alkali metal perborates, alkali metal persulfates, hydrogen peroxide, organic peroxides and organic peracids. A modifying agent is used, such as carbon tetrachloride, hexachloroethane, chloroalkyl cyanides, alkyl mercaptans, xanthogen disulfides, and thiuram disulfides. Generally, the emulsion polymerization system can have the following composition, expressed in parts by weight per hundred parts of monomers PHM Butadiene 60 75 parts p Methylstyrene 25 40 parts Emulsifying Agent 1 5 parts Polymerization Catalyst 0.1 1 part Modifying Agent 0.1 1 part litter 10C 300 parts The polymerization reaction is carried out at temperatures of about 40 600C. In general, reaction times are about 10 15 hours. At the end of the emulsion polymerization, unreacted catalyst is destroyed with a shortstop, such as hydroquinone, added to the latex. The rubber is recovered from the latex by pouring the latex into dilute sulfuric acid and recovering the rubber crumb.The crumb is then water washed and dried. Compounding of p methylstyrene butadiene rubber is similar to that of natural rubber. Softeners, such as stearic acid 1 2 PHR , are used, as well as extenders and processing aids, such as viscous and highly aromatic mineral oils. Fillers, carbon black curing agents sulfur or selenium , accelerators thiazole compounds , and activators zinc oxide are used. Temperature and time of cure are similar to those used for natural rubber. The following examples demonstrate the rubbers of this invention in comparison to styrene butadiene rubber SBR . In the examples and tables, the p methylstyrene butadiene rubber of this invention is abbreviated PMSBR. Unless designated otherwise, all units are by weight expressed in parts per hundred parts of monomers PHM or of rubber PHR .

The mixture was stirred and warmed to 600C. on a hot plate until clear. The soap initiator solution was charged into a clean, dry, N2 purged and evacuated autoclave reactor.A solution of styrene, or p methylstyrene, and t dodecyl mercaptan was prepared and charged to the reactor.Then, 1,3 butadiene was charged to the reactor from a one liter Hoke bomb. With stirring, the reactor was set at a temperature of 500C. and the polymerization was carried out for 12 hours. After 1 2 hours polymerization at 500C., the latex was cooled to room temperature ca. 200C. and 15 drops of anti foam agent was added. After 15 minutes, stirring was stopped and unreacted butadiene was vented from the autoclave. Antioxidant was added to the latex and unreacted monomers were stripped by vacuum distillation at 600C. at 25 mm. Hg, using a rotary evaporator. The latex poured into 1 2 its volume of 0.7 aqueous H2S04 in a blender to coagulate the rubber crumb. The crumb was water washed and vacuum dried in an oven for 64 hours at 800C., using a nitrogen sweep.
