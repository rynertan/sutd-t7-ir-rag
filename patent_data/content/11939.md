# Digital cardiac pacemaker pulse generator.

## Abstract
A programmable medical device, e.g. a cardiac pacemaker, utilizes digital circuitry 40 for controlling circuitry 42 for providing clocks, an output circuit and heart activity sensing. Digital circuit 40 includes a memory in which may be programmed on a permanent or temporary basis from an external programmer control information relating to rate, pulse width, pulse amplitude, refractory period, sense amp lifier sensitivity and the mode of operation desired. In addition the output can be inhibited or a threshold margin test can be performed in which a reduced energy output pulse is pro vided to check if heart capture is lost. The pacemaker can operate in a hysteresis mode and provides a high rate limit which can however be exceeded by programming. The pacemaker further includes means for signalling the accep tance of a programming signal and means to reset the prog ram acceptance circuit if extraneous signals are detected as programming signals. The acceptance circuit checks for the receipt of the proper number of signals within a given time, for an access code and correct parity. Timing is by means of a crystal oscillator and a voltage controlled oscillator controls pulse width to obtain energy compensation with varying bat tery voltage.
