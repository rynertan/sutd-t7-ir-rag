# PROCESS FOR THE ANALYSIS OF HAEMOGLOBIN HBA2

## Abstract
The invention relates to a process for the analysis of haemoglobin HbA₂ characterized in that it comprises the following steps a mixing an anionic resin with a hemolysate of blood b agitation of the mixture obtained in a , to obtain separation in two phases c filtration of the light phase containing haemoglobin HbA₂ and d photometric analysis of the filtrate obtained in c . The process permits the obtainment of a particularly rapid analysis of haemoglobin HbA₂ and allows the carrying out of batch analyses.
