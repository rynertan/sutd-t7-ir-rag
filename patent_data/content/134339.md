## Description
HERBICIDAL COMPOSITION Background of the Invention 1 Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a herbicidal composition comprising as active ingredients sodium N rn ethoxycarbonylsulfanylamide and mal ei c hydrazid e or a salt thereof. 2 Description of the Prior Art It is known that a herbicide comprising sodiumN methoxycarbonylsulfanylamide hereinafter referred to as Asulam Sodium has a control effect of a broad spectrum to weeds of the rice family such as fingergrass, goose grass, barny.ard grass and annual bluegrass, annual weeds such as Polygonum blumei meisner, annual fleabane, dayflower, common chickweed, shovelweed andJapanese clover, perennial weeds such as bracken, culy dock, butterbur, common groundsel, needle grass and hedge bindweed, and deciduous miscellaneous shrubs such as oak, chestnut d Japanese oak.However, this ferbicide is insufficient in controlling the growth of the subterranean part such as rhizome, tuber or bulb of culy dock which brings about the most serious damage among perennial weeds often growing in a pasture or orchard, and therefore, the effect to old plants 3 to 5 years old is poor though a sufficient effect is expected to young plants 1 to 2 years old . Namely, the herbicide is defective in that the effect is relatively insufficient in the actual application.Moreover, it is undesirable to apply this chemical in large amounts since it decomposes slovly in the soil and its residual amount in the soil is large. Maleic hydrazide hereinafter referred to as wMH or its salt is widely used for controlling perrenial weeds such as culy dock, butterbur, hedge bindweed, wormwood, common sorrel, Japanese knotweed, red garlic and dandelion. However, this herbicide is defective in that the herbicidal effect greatly differs according to the kinds of weeds. When NH or its salt is used in the growth period of perennial weeds, that is, in spring or summer, a highest effect is attained by a method in which a terrestrial stem or leaf portion is cut off after passage of about 7 to about 10 days from the time of the chemical treatment. Even if this method is adopted, it is necessary that the chemical should be applied at such a high rate as more than 500 g per 10 ares.Moreover, in order to control the growth of the subterranean part such as rhizome, tuber or bulb , it is necessary to apply the chemical at a rate of at least 1,000 g per 10 ares. Accordingly, it is of ten difficult to obtain the intended controlling effect stably. Summary of the Invention We made researches with a view to eliminating the above disadvantages encountered in controlling perennial weeds, and as the result, we found that whenAsulam Sodium and MH are used in combination, a very high synergistic effect can be attained. Ye have now completed the present invention based on this finding. More specifically, in accordance with the present invention, there is provided a herbicidal composition comprising as active ingredients sodium N methoxycarbonylsulfanylamide and maleic hydrazide or a salt thereof. Detailed Des criti on of the Invention In the present invention, by the term maleic hydrazide or a salt thereof are meant maleic hydrazide, choline maleic hydrazide, diethanolAmine maleic hydrazide, sodium maleic hydrazide and potassium maleic hydrazide. The herbicidal composition of the present invention can completely control perennial weeds often growing in an orchard, a pasture, a forest or other non cultivated ground such as culy dock, bracken, common sorrel, horsenettle and kudzu, and shrubs perennial tree weeds such as rosebay, oak Quercus serrata , white alder, spicebush and brambles. Furthermore, annual weeds and small perennial weeds such as wormwood, red garlic, hedge bindweed, nut grass, yellow cress, Yabugarashi Cayratio japonica and Jishibari Ixeris debilis can be controlled by the herbicidal composition of the present invention. The amount of Asulam Sodium contained in the herbicidal composition of the present invention is ordinarily 20 to 300 g per 10 ares and preferably 50 to 250 g per 10 ares. If the amount applied of AsulamSodium is smaller than 20 g per 10 ares, the herbicidal effect is insufficient, and if the amount applied ofAsulam Sodium exceeds 300 g per 10 ares, the treatment is economically disadvantageous and the amount of the chemical left in soil is increased. When the herbicidal composition of The present invention is applied to wellgrown weeds, it is preferred that a larger chemical amount be selected within the above mentioned range. The amount of MH or its salt contained in the applied herbicidal composition of the present invention is ordinarily 50 to 500 g per 10 ares and preferably 100 to 250 g per 10 ares as maleic hydrazide. The ratio between Asulam Sodium and NH in the herbicidal composition of the present invention can optionally be chosen within such a range that the application rate of Asulam Sodium is 20 to 300 g per 10 ares and the application rate of NH or its salt is 50 to 500 g per 10 ares. If both the ingredients are aixed at such a ratio, a herbicidal composition having an excellent herbicidal effect can be obtained. In the present invention, choline maleic hydrazide is especially excellent in the effect among salts of maleic hydrazide, and diethanolamine maleic hydrazide comes next. The herbicidable composition of the present invention is ordinarily formullated into a liquid or powder preparation. Diatomaceous earth or talc is used as the carrier when a powder preparation or dust is formed. When a liquid preparation is formed, in order to improve the permeability and spreading property, it is preferred that an ad3uvant be incorporated into the herbicidal composition. Of course, the ado want may be added to the herbicidal composition when it is actually used. From the viewpoint of the effect, a liquid preparation is preferred. From the viewpoints of the homogenization of the chemicals and the enhancement of the herbicidal effect, it is preferred that the unit amount per 10 ares of the herbicidal composition be diluted with about 100 liters of water when the herbicidal composition of the present invention is applied. When the herbicidal composition of the present invention is used, a very excellent herbicidal effect can be obtained very promptly with a much smaller amount than the amount of the chemical when AsulamSodium or NH or its salt is used singly. The process for preparing the herbicidal composition of the present invention will now be described with reference to the following Examples.Example 1 28 Parts by weight of an aqueous solution of AsulamSodium containing 37 X by weight of Asulam Sodium was incorporated and mixed in 68 parts by weight of an aqueous solution of choline maleic hydrazide containing 30 by weight of maleic hydrazide , and 4 parts by weight of a surface active agent 1 1 mixture of polyoxyethylene oleyl ether and laurylsulphate triethanolamine was added to the mixture to obtain a product which contained 39 parts by weight of choline maleic hydrazide 20 parts by weight as maleic hydrazide and 10 parts by weight of Asulam Sodium.Example 2 28 Parts by weight of an aqueous solution of AsulamSodium containing 37 by weight of Asulam Sodium was incorporated and mixed into 68 parts by weight of an aqueous solution of diethanolamine maleic hydrazide containing 30 X by weight of maleic hydrazide , and 4 parts by weight of a surface active agent 1 1 mixture of polyoxyethylene oleyl ether and dioctyl sulfosuccinate was added to the mixture to obtain a product which contained 39 parts by weight of di ethanolamine maleic hydrazide 20 parts by weight as maleic hydrazide and 10 parts by weight of Asulam Sodium. Example. 5 15 Parts by weight of an aqueous solution of AsulamSodium containing 37 by weight of Asulan Sodium was incorporated and mixed into 50 parts by weight of an aqueous solution of potassium maleic hydrazide containing 20, by weight of maleic hydrazide , and 5 parts by weight of a surface active agent 1 1 mixture of polyoxyethylene oleyl ether and dioctyl sulfosuccinate and 29 parts by weight of water were added to the mixture to obtain a product which contained 12 parts by weight of potassium maleic hydrazide 10 parts by weight as maleic hydrazide , 5 parts by weight AsulamSodium and 5 parts by weight of the surface active agent with the balance being water.Example 4 To 100 parts by weight of calcium carbonate having a size of 48 to 150 mesh and a purity higher than 90 were added 4 parts by weight of an aqueous solution of choline maleic hydrazide containing 30 by weight of maleic hydrazide , 3 parts by weight of an aqueous solution of Asulam Sodium containing 37 96 by weight ofAsulam Sodium and 0.1 part by weight of a surface active agent comprising 0.5 part by weight of polyoxyethylene dodecyl ether and 0.05 part by weight of dioctyl sulfosuccinate , and the mixture was heated and water was sufficiently evaporated to obtain a product. The herbicidal effect of the herbicidal composition will now be described with reference to the followingTests.Test 1 In order to confirm the herbicidal effect, edible millet rice family and raddish broad leaved plant were cultivated as indicator plants in an infant plant tester, and an aqueous solution of choline NH, an aqueous solution of Asulam Sodium or an aqueous solution of a mixture of both the chemicals was uniformly sprayed to the plants at a rate of 100 liters per 10 ares at the growth period of the 4. 5 leaf stage of edible millest and 4 leaf stage of raddish.

The every year appearance of a perennial weed is due to nutriments stored in the subterraneane part.Accordingly, in order to exterminate perennial weeds, it is necessary to control the growth of the subterranean parts, and this is a most important requirement for controlling perennial weeds. In order to confirm this action, the herbicidal composition of the present invention was tested by using potato as the indicator plant perennial weed in the following manner. Tubers of potato were soil cultivated in a pot having an area of 10 x 1 88,500 are, and when the grass height became 20 cm, a mixed chemical of choline MH andAsulam Sodium shown in Table 3 was sprayed to all the stems and leaves. When 40 days had passed from the time of the spray treatment, the grass height became 50 cm.At this time, new tubers were digged out and examined. The obtained results are shown in Table 3.
