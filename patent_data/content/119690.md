# Disc brakes for rail vehicles.

## Abstract
In a disc brake for a rail vehicle a pair of friction mem bers 29 for engagement with opposite faces of a rotatable disc 25 are carried by the inner ends of a pair of caliper le vers 27, 28 which are adapted to be separated at their outer ends by a fixed actuator 32 . A return spring 40 acts between the levers 27, 28 to hold each lever against its own actuator output member 33, 34 and this maintains substantially constant braking clearances on opposite sides of the disc 25 when the brake is released.
