# Switch.

## Abstract
Disclosed is an electrical switch which may be of a type having a toggle mechanism or a buckling mechanism for achieving abrupt motion of its movable piece and is additionally provided with a means for forcibly disengaging a movable contact formed on the movable piece away from a fixed contact even when the movable contact and the fixed contact are welded together due to the heat generated from the contacts. This means may be conveniently comprised of a pair of rack gears and a pinion gear so that the force applied to the switch may be also transmitted to the disengagement means for, in addition to normal switching action, pulling the movable contact away from the fixed contact. This means may also be comprised of other mechanism, but a favourable result will be obtained if the disengagement means acts upon a middle portion of the movable piece as far away as possible from the contacts because the heat from the contacts may deform the working end of the disengagement means which is typically made of synthetic resin.
