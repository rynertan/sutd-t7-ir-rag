# A device for measuring the wall thickness of an extruded tubular section during extrusion, extrusion apparatus with such a device and extruded tubular section obtained by using said device.

## Abstract
A device for measuring the wall thickness of an extruded tube 3 by means of ultrasonic pulses comprises a tube wall thickness measuring instrument 7 being rotatable about the circumference of the tube 3 and being connected to an arm 9 extending in a plane perpendicular to the tube 3 . The arm 9 is hingedly 11 connected in said plane to a ring 8 perpen dicular to the axis of the tube and concentrically about the tube 3 . The arm 9 bears a weight 10 outside said ring 8 . An ad justable pressure element 12 , such as a spring or preferably a two way operable air cylinder, acts upon the arm 9 . The measuring element may engage two supporting faces 14 , the angle between the supporting faces being adjustable. Furthermore a detachable fixing element, such as a mag net 13 , engages the arm 9 so that the arm can be discon nected from the magnet and may be moved from the plane per pendicular to the tube 4 . The wall thickness is measured only by means of one echo coming from the inner wall of the tube when an ultrasonic pulse emitted by the device 7 hits said wall.
