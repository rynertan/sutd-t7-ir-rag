# Mould, process of moulding, and article moulded by such process.

## Abstract
An article having a flange is moulded between a mould core and a unitary mould cavity, the flange being formed during the process as a consequence of an undercut 37 49 existing in a first surface 15 51 of the cavity 14, 58 . A ridge 39 59 is provided on a second surtace 27 57 of the mould cavity adjacent the undercut 37 49 . A fluid, i.e., air, is injected between the cavity and the moulded article 18 42 as the core 12 62 and cavity 14 58 separate in such a volume and at such a pressure as will maintain the article 18 42 in substantially complete and constant contact with the core as the core and article are withdrawn from the cavity. The flange 36 50 conforms to the cavity wall 15 51 until the article is free from the cavity, and subsequently the moulded article 18 42 is separated from the mould core.
