## Description
This invention relates to the manufacture of flexible polyurethane foam articles. According to the present invention we provide a method for the manufacture of a flexible polyurethane foam article which comprises introducing into a mould a flexible polyurethane foam forming mixture, especially such a mixture based on polymeric MDI as hereinafter defined and allowing the mixture to foam under a pressure less than normal atmospheric pressure and set. The invention also includes the polyurethane foam article so produced. The expression flexible polyurethane foam forming mixture is well understood by the skilled worker in the polyurethanes field and methods for the preparation of these mixtures are fully described in the literature. They involve mixing together a polyisocyanate, a polyol and a blowing agent optionally in the presence of other conventional ingredients such as catalysts, surfactants, modifiers, fillers, plasticisers and pigments. When water is used as the blowing agent it reacts with the isocyanate liberating carbon dioxide and forming a urea linkage.The term polyurethane will be understood, therefore, to include polymers containing urea as well as urethane groups. Hitherto tolylene diisocyanate TDI has been the preponderantly used isocyanate for flexible polyurethane foam manufacture. While another commercially available polyisocyanate, diphenylmethane diisocyanate MDI , which is commonly obtained in a crude or polymeric form, is considerably less volatile and safer to use, it has over riding chemical and economic disadvantages in flexible foam manufacture. These disadvantages arise from the insolubility and phase separation of the ureas or biurets formed from the initial reaction of MDI and water and from the higher molecular weight of MDI which reduces the efficiency of blowing the foam by the carbon dioxide generated during the water isocyanate reaction.There is a greater reacting mass for a given volume of carbon dioxide and more isocyanate to water needs to be used to achieve a given density reduction than in the case of a TDI based reaction.This compounds the ill effects of the insoluble hard block formation giving stiff unattractive polymers with low tensile properties and poor recovery from compression. It is therefore an unexpected advantage of the method of the present invention that MDI can be used to make an acceptable flexible foam, for instance, for general upholstery applications. In particular, we have found that the reduced amount of MDI required in our process to provide sufficient carbon dioxide for blowing at reduced pressure enables the production of low cost flexible foams where the required level of polymer cross linking is obtained by the use of MDI containing a proportion of branched isocyanate.Thus, of special value for use in the present invention are flexible polyurethane foam forming mixtures based on polymeric MDI. Polymeric MDI is a mixture of methylene bridged polyphenyl polyisocyanates containing diisocyanates and higher functionality polyisocyanates and is obtainable from the phosgenation of a corresponding mixture of polyamines which in turn is obtained by condensing aniline with formaldehyde. The constitution of the polymeric MDI will depend inter alia on the selected ratio of reactants in the aniline formaldehyde condensation and may be adjusted by distillation or crystallisation of all or part of the isocyanate mixture followed by back blending with undistilled material of the distillate, which is optionally further purified and or partially reacted with a polyol to form an isocyanate ended prepolymer. Polymeric MDI compositions are more fully described in, for example, our British patents 1444192 and 1450660. The mixture of isocyanates normally contains from 5 to 70 by weight of polyisocyanates of functionality greater than two and usually from 20 to 60 by weight of such polyisocyanates. We have found the most suitable polymeric MDI compositions to be those containing 50 to 75 by weight of diisocyanate, 10 to 40 by weight of triisocyanate and preferably less than 20 by weight of higher functionality isocyanates. The diisocyanate component of the MDI composition ideally consists of 50 to 80 by weight of the 4,4 isomer ofMDI with 10 to 50 by. weight of the 2,4 isomer and may also contain up to 3X by weight of the 2,2 isomer of MDI. The diisocyanate may be partially reacted with a polyol of equivalent weight between 250 and 2000. Polyols suitable for preparing the foam forming mixture are well known to the skilled polyurethanes worker.These include polyesters but polyethers are normally used for flexible foams. They may be mixed with the polyisocyanate, blowing agent and other ingredients in one lot to form the foam forming mixture or part of the polyol may be pre reacted with the polyisocyanate to form an isocyanate ended prepolymer which is then mixed with the remainder of the polyol, the blowing agent and other ingredients immediately before the foam forming mixture so obtained is introduced into the mould. The polymeric MDI compositions which we have found most suitable are mixed with polyol composilions consisting of polyether diols, triols or quadrols, or mixtures thereof, of equivalent weight between 750 and 2000 containing 0.4 to 4.0 by weight of water and usefully minor amounts of suitable catalysts, structure modifying surfactants and flame retardant additives. These mixtures allow the use of isocyanate indices less than 100, i.e. they allow the use of a stoichometric excess of polyol to give foams of commercially desirable properties. The use of a stoichometric excess of the polyol component results in rapid foam cure and ensures the absence of free volatile isocyanate in the hot freshly made foam on removal from the mould. If a prepolymer is to be prepared in a two stage reaction the quantities of the MDI composition and polyether are chosen to give an isocyanate ended prepolymer having an isocyanate value in the range of from 10 to 30 by weight isocyanate. The polyethers used in the first and second stages may differ in molecular weight and functionality. The pressure under which the foam forming mixture foams is controlled at less than normal atmospheric pressure and is typically about 0.5 bar. It need not be constant, however, and may vary during the moulding period.The pressure in the mould is reduced normally before any significant foam rise recurs. The optimum pressure profile, i.e. the optimum rate of change of pressure during the moulding period, will depend inter alia on the particular foam formulation chosen and will readily be determined by trial. Of necessity the mould will need to be enclosed and connected to a vacuum source. A combination of an evacuated reservoir and vacuum pump will permit rapid removal of air from the mould once the foam forming ingredients have been introduced and control of the reduced pressure during the foaming process. The capacities of the reservoir and pump will be determined by the size and number of moulds served and on the particular foam forming mixture used since the rate of gas evolution varies from one foam formulation to another.For example, a MDI based foam tends to evolve more gas than a TDI based foam towards the end of the foam forming reaction. In a preferred method of the present invention the evacuated reservoir is a second mould of a plurality of moulds which form part of a moulding plant used for the sequential batch manufacture of flexible foam articles. Thus according to another aspect of this invention we provide a method for moulding in sequence flexible polyurethane foam articles by repeating the cycle of steps which comprises introducing a flexible polyurethane foam forming mixture into a first mould connecting the first mould to a second mould which contains therein a previously foamed flexible foam article and which is at less than normal atmospheric pressure thereby to reduce the pressure in the first mould to less than normal atmospheric pressure continuing to maintain the first mould at less than normal atmospheric pressure during foaming using a secondary pressure reducing source isolating the second mould from the first, venting the second mould and removing therefrom the previously formed flexible foam article connecting the first mould to the second mould or to a third mould in which a flexible foam forming mixture has been introduced thereby to reduce the pressure in that second or third mould and thereafter isolating the first mould from that second or third mould, venting the first mould and removing the moulded article therefrom. Such a process finds particular application in the discontinuous manufacture of flexible slabstock, that is blocks of foam typically measuring 2 x 1 x 1 By enabling MDI based flexible foams to be produced, the method of the invention obviates the high velocity and high volume e.g. 25,000 ft3 min air extraction systems associated with present TDI based slabstock plants as the gaseous effluent from the closed moulds may be exhausted via a rotary suction pump and a simple low capacity absorbent column or scrubbing device without hazard to the operators or contamination of the environment.The use of MDI instead of TDI reduces the volatile isocyanate vapour by a factor of about 500 and the high reactivity of most of the isocyanate groups in the preferred MDI compositions compared with TDI results in extremely low levels of unreacted isocyanate remaining in the hot foam immediately after de moulding. Further, the use of a polymeric or modified polymeric MDI composition with significant triisocyanate content enables the production of sufficiently cross linked polymers at low levels of polyisocyanate and water. In a further aspect of our invention we provide moulding apparatus for making a flexible foam article which comprises an enclosed sectional mould which has an inlet for the reception of a foam forming mixture and which is connected to a device for exhausting air or other gas or vapour from the mould, said device being controllable to maintain the pressure in the mould at less than normal atmospheric pressure and on a predetermined pressure profile. By sectional mould we mean a mould constituted by a plurality of sections or parts which can be clamped, interlocked or otherwise held firmly together during the moulding process, the mould being opened or dismembered into its component sections or parts to release the moulded article. It is desirable that the sections or parts should b sealable in gas tight manner to enable precise control and collection of all vapours generated during the foaming reaction and to minimise the use of carbon dioxide blowing to reduce the volume and temperature of the gases produced.In addition the use of vacuum sealed moulds and integral mixing heads removes any hazard from isocyanate vapour as well as reducing the amount of isocyanate required for the blowing reaction. The device for exhausting gas or vapour from the mould may be a vacuum pump or zither pressure reducing source but preferably it comprises a reservoir which can be held at less than atmospheric pressure to provide a means for rapid exhaustion of the mould and additionally a vacuum pump for maintaining the pressure in the mould on the predetermined pressure profile. Conveniently the reservoir is a second mould, the moulds being part of a moulding plant for the sequential manufacture of flexible foam articles. Thus according to yet a further aspect of our invention we provide a moulding plant for making in sequence flexible foam articles which comprises a plurality of moulds, each mould having an inlet for the reception of a flexible foam forming mixture, a vent and an outlet for the exhaustion of air or other gas or vapour from the mould, the outlet being connected through a valve arrangement to a second mould, which itself can be exhausted of gas or vapour, and to a secondary pressure reducing source. By way of example only, the method and apparatus of the invention will now be described in relation to one embodiment with reference to the accompanying drawing which is schematic isometric diagram of part of a flexible foam moulding plant. In the drawing, enclosed sectional moulds A and B have integral mixing heads 5 and 4,respectively, which are connected to foam ingredient lines 11 and 12, vents 13 and 14 controlled by valves 6 and 7, and outlets 15 and 16 to which pressure gauges 17 and 18 are attached. MouldsA and B and a rotary vacuum pump 3, which is served by a scrubber 22, are interconnected via outlets 15 and 16 by lines 19, 20 and 21, the moulds being isolatable from each other and from vacuum pump 3 by valves 1, 2 and 8. In operation, with all valves initially shut and the vacuum pump running, valves 1 and 8 are opened to connect mould A to vacuum pump 3 and the pressure in A is reduced to a predetermined value which, in this example, is 0.5 bar. A polymeric MDI composition and polyol blend are metered to mixing head 4 and dispensed as a foam forming mixture into mould B. As soon as the mixture has been dispensed in 1 to 20 seconds , valve 2 is opened to connect mould B with mould A and with vacuum pump 3 to obtain a rapid reduction in the pressure in mould B to a predetermined value. Precise control of the rate of pressure drop and its final value are obtained by control of valves 1, 2 and 8 using electrical operation monitored and controlled by an electronic microprocessor which keys also the operation of the foam injection system.On completion of foaming, mould B, now full of reacted foam under reduced pressure, is isolated by valve 1 from mould A which is allowed to reach atmospheric pressure via valve 6. Foam mix is admitted to mould A and the pressure reduced to a predetermined value by closing valve 6 and operating valves 1, 2 and 8 to an extent determined by monitoring the pressure in mould A. At the end of this cycle air is admitted to mould B via vent 14, the mould is opened and the slab of foam, now substantially free from volatile materials is removed and transferred to a cooling and storage room. The system may be enlarged by the addition of further moulds. This not only increases production capacity but, by connecting several moulds by suitably controlled valve and piping arrangements, rapid and controlled pressure reductions may be obtained in the mould during foaming without the need for very high capacity vacuum pumps and high levels of contaminated exhaust gas.
