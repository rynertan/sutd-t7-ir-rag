# Method in a microtome for creating the possibility that the slit between the knife edge and the specimen can be made extremely narrow.

## Abstract
Method in a microtome, especially an ultramicrotome, in which a knife edge being turnable around its longitudinal axis is used to cut sections from a specimen 2 by making the specimen 2 pass the knife edge downwards, for making possible that the distance between the knife edge and the specimen 2 before cutting can be made extremely narrow without the specimen 2 touching the knife 1 , and in which the slit is lit up from below by a light waveguide 8 one end of which is located under the knife edge and is turned with this and the other end of which is lit up by a light source movable in relation to the turning of the knife edge, the light from the waveguide 8 then reflecting against the surfaces of the knife 1 as well as of the specimen 2 which are turned towards the slit and the image of the knife surface reflected in the specimen surface, the size of which is proportional to the breadth of the slit, is looked at from at least one point located in a vertical plane outside the vertical plane of the slit and on the same side of this as the knife 1 .
