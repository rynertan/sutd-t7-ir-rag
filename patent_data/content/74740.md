## Description
THIS INVENTION relates to a heat exchanger and, in particular, to a heat exchanger comprising a core element comprising a plurality of substantially parallel plates in stacked relationship so as to define a multiplicity of flow passages for a working fluid alternating with a plurality of flow passages for a process fluid, the arrangement being such that, in use, a fluid makes at least two passes through the core element in different said flow passages in series. Hitherto heat exchangers have comprised a number of different types which have all had various deficiencies which have included the requirement for constant maintenance because of complex construction and more importantly unequal distribution of fluid flow therein. This latter problem did not provide the desired characteristic of constant heat transfer over the available heat exchange or working area. In one conventional heat exchanger commonly used in marine applications there was provided an array or bundle of tubes usually made from copper having relatively thin walls and a surrounding or external shell. Usually transmission fluid or oil was passed through the bundle or tubes while sea water was passed through the external shell so as to cool the transmission fluid or oil. While the bundle of tubes could be withdrawn from the external shell for cleaning or maintenance, it was found that this task was relatively time consuming and also that the external shell was liable to corrosion. It was also found that the velocity of the working fluid through the tube bundle was adversely affected if a blockage occured in one or more tubes and this factor did not help in satisfactory operation of the heat exchanger because of the problem of unequal distribution of flow referred to above. In relation to conventional plate type heat exchangers of the type shown in Specifications FR A 2428 811 and EP A 0 014,863 these are mainly concerned with treatment of gases at different temperatures and are specifically directed at ensuring that the gas flow direction into and out from the heat exchanger is kept constant so that the heat exchanger can be utilized for certain specific conditions such as for room ventilation and the like. Specification FR A 2428 811 concerns a rather complicated method of construction which involves the interconnection of exchanger plates, segments provided with openings and closed segments in stacked relationship wherein the exchanger plates are formed from thin metal plate. US A 3,731,736 describes and illustrates a plate and fin heat exchanger comprising a plurality of parallel flattened tubes within each of which is defined a plurality of parallel flow passages by means of corrugated fin strips which are brazed to the upper and lower walls of the tube. The flow passages of adjacent tubes are perpendicular to each other. In use, a first liquid describes a single pass through a first set of tubes which are connected in parallel with each other and a second liquid describes a tortuous path through a second set of tubes which are connected in parallel with each other and which alternate with the first set of tubes. The tortous path is defined by the fin strips and by manifold means, ribs of which engage the fin strips. The manifold means additionally comprise inlet and outlet means. GB A 724,091 relates to a heat exchanger of the type comprising a core element comprising a plurality of substantially parallel plates in stacked relationship so as to define a multiplicity of flow passages for a working fluid alternating with a plurality of flaw passages for a process fluid, the arrangement being such that, in use, a fluid makes at least two passes through the care element in different said flow passages in series. An array of flow passages for milk alternates with an array of flow passages for water or other coolant so that both milk and coolant undergo a serpentine or zig zag flow path through the heat exchanger. The ends of the flow passages communicate with each other by means of liquid carrying ports which extend through the plates comprising the core. The heat exchanger described in GB A 724,091 is only adapted for cooling milk and it is essential to make provision for air vents adjacent the flow passages through the core because of the tendency of air pockets to form. It has now been discovered in relation to plate type heat exchangers that one may selectively control the flow directions of fluids under treatment upon flow through the plate type heat exchanger so as to provide a heat exchanger which may be used for different applications such as in the treatment of gases or liquids. Thus the heat exchanger of the invention may be used in the food industry, as a vehicle radiator component, in air conditioning or in engines or motors. The heat exchanger of the present invention is characterised in that fluid may exit from each passage externally of the core element, and in that at least one diversion element is attached to the core element adjacent an array of openings corresponding to the process or working fluid so that, in use, that fluid is diverted back through the core element so as to make at least two passes therethrough in different flaw passage in series, whereby the specific juxta position of the core element and the said at least one diversion element selectively controls the direction of process fluid and or working fluid flow through the heat exchanger. In one aspect the heat exchanger may comprise an inlet component and an outlet component, as well as the core element, and it is the specific juxtaposition of these members that selectively controls the direction of process fluid and or working fluid flow. In another aspect the heat exchanger may comprise a return component, a core element and an inlet outlet component, and it is the specific juxtaposition of these members that selectively controls the direction of process fluid and or working fluid flow. The care element in relation to this invention may comprise any number of different constructions and arrangement of process fluid passages and working fluid passages. Thus in one type there may be provided a core where each working fluid passage is located adjacent to a process fluid passage such that the flow direction of working fluid may be at right angles to the flow direction of the process fluid in their respective passages. In another situation the flow directions of both process fluid and working fluid in their respective passages may be substantially parallel. In this latter arrangement the respective flow directions may be the same or concurrent or may be opposite or countercurrent. In each of the situations described above in the preceding paragraph it is preferred that the core be such that both process fluid and working fluid travel a serpentine or tortuous path throughout the core from their respective inlet to their respective outlet. This is because in this particular embodiment each fluid is retained within the core and therefore within the effective working area of the apparatus for a longer period of time than if it were allowed to pass only once through the core. Preferably each flow passage is substantially planar and of a rectangular shape. The core may also comprise a plurality of core components or modules which are capable of being interfitted one with the other so as to provide a composite core which can be erected It is also within the ambit of the invention to provide for a plurality of different process fluids or working fluids to be treated by the same core. Preferably however in this embodiment there are provided a plurality of different process fluids to be treated by a single working fluid. The inlet and outlet for each fluid may be of any suitable type. Preferably however the inlet may include a casing divided into two separate housings by an appropriate partition wherein each housing has a series of slots with each slot communicating with an associated flow passage of the core. One housing may have an inlet conduit and the other housing have an outlet conduit. If desired there also may be employed diversion plates to be placed adjacent one end of the core so as to divert or change the fluid direction of both process and working fluids. There also may be provided end or side plates or manifolds which when placed adjacent on an associated end or side of the core ensure that both process fluid and working fluid follow the desired serpentine or tortuous path described above. In some cases the flow passages may have progressively increasing dimensions or cross sectional area from one end to the other so as to provide for change of state of fluids wherein gas may be converted to liquid or vice versa and even for change of state from solid to gas or vice versa. It will also be appreciated in most cases sealing means may be required to seal off working fluid flow passages from adjacent process fluid passages. Normally such sealing means comprise continuous seals such as perimeter seals. Reference may now be made to a preferred embodiment of the invention as shown in the attached drawings wherein In FIG 1 there is shown core 10 comprising a plurality of plates 11 interconnected by webs 12 to form a series of parallel flow passages 16 and a multiplicity of flow passages 17 extending at right angles to passages 16. There is also shown process fluid inlet outlet manifold 15, operating fluid inlet manifold 14 and process fluid return cover or manifold 13.

Operating fluid enters through inlet 9 of manifold 14, through top passageway 17 in core 11, through a recess in an outlet operating fluid manifold similar to manifold 14 but arranged in opposite manner not shown for clarity and then through recesses 8, 7 and 6 and out through an outlet in the operating fluid outlet manifold which is not shown after travel through aligned passageways 17 in core 10. In FIG 2 there is shown core 10A having a series of parallel operating fluid flow passageways 25 and a multiplicity of parallel process fluid passageways 26. Core 10A comprises plates 11A interconnected by webs 12A. There is also shown manifold 33, diversion chamber or member 29, and manifold 30. As shown by the arrows in relation to core 11A, operating fluid enters through inlet 23A of manifold 33, along top passageway 25, through top passageway 27 in diversion member 29, through recess 31 in manifold 30, and through second passageway 25 until an additional diversion chamber or member not shown is encountered which is similar to member 29. This additional diversion member causes operating fluid to then travel into recess 36 and subsequently through recess 31A in manifold 30, recess 36B in manifold 33, recess 31B in manifold 30, recess 36C in manifold 33 and finally out through outlet 30A in manifold 30 along corresponding passageways 25 in core 10A and passageways 27 in diversion chamber 29. The direction of the flow path of the operating fluid is shown by the arrows included in side panel 12B. In a similar manner process fluid enters through inlet 22A, along top passageway 26, top passageway 28 in diversion member 29, through recess 32 in manifold 30 and subsequently through recess 34A in manifold 33, recess 32A in manifold 30, recess 34B in manifold 33, recess 32B in manifold 30 and finally out through outlet 35 in manifold 33 after travelling through aligned passageways 26 in core 10A and 28 in diversion chamber 29. The direction of the flow path of the process fluid is shown by the arrows aligned with flow passages 26. In relation to FIGS 3, 4 and 5 there is shown core 38 including vertically oriented passageways 44 and horizontally oriented passageways 45. The direction of flow of process fluid is shown by the arrows aligned with passages 45 and the direction of flow of operating fluid is shown by the arrows aligned with passages 44.

As shown in FIG 5, operating fluid flows through inlet 46 and passageways 45 via recesses 47 and 48 to outlet 43. In FIG 6 9, there is illustrated another type of heat exchanger comprising core 51, operating fluid inlet outlet manifold 52, return manifold 53, process fluid inlet outlet manifold 54, and return manifold 55A. As best shown in FIG 9, manifolds 52 and 55A are located as shown in relation to core 51 so that flow passageways 59 of manifold 55A are oriented across or are normal to flow passageways 55B of manifold 52. In a similar manner manifolds 53 and 54 are located as shown in relation to core 51 so that flow passageways 59A of manifold 54 are orientated normal to flow passageways 55C of manifold 53. When the manifolds 52 and 55A and 53 and 54 are positioned as described above in conjunction with core 51, the flow paths of both operating fluid and process fluid have the directions indicated by the arrows in FIGS 6 9. Thus in relation to the process fluid, it enters the heat exchanger through inlet 58 through passageways 59A, then travels through aligned passageway in core 51 not shown to passageways 59 in manifold 55A then back into core 51. The process fluid then flows through aligned passageways not shown with flow passages 59 and subsequently into passageways 59A of manifold 54 which are aligned with outlet 60. In regard to the operating fluid, this travels from inlet 56 in manifold 52 through aligned passageways 55B, through corresponding passageways not shown of core 51, then through passageways 55C of manifold 53 and back into core 51 along appropriate passageways not shown to passages 55B in manifold 52 and back through core 51 to passageways 55C and finally to the outlet 57 after final passage through core 51 as shown in FIG 6.

Flow channels 209 and 210 are also shown which again are alternative forms as are flow channels 211 and 212. The provision of corrugated plates provides a flow pattern as shown by the dotted lines in FIG 40 and means that the effective interior surface area of the core element is very much increased causing longer retention time for fluids when travelling through the core element. In FIG 41 there is shown heat exchanger having core element 213 and inlet outlet component 214 and 215. Each component 214 and 215 includes partitions 216 in recesses 217.

As will be apparent from the foregoing discussion the invention in one aspect also provides heat exchangers having a greater ability to withstand pressures of the order of at least 2.5 p.s.i. 17,2 10³ N m² more suitably about 5 p.s.i. 34,4 10³ N m² and most preferably at least 10 p.s.i. 68,8 10³ N m² These pressures refer to the pressure generated within the interior of the core when the process fluid and operating or working fluid are travelling therethrough. The core elements as described above may be provided with longitudinally extending rods or plates which may also function as flow dividers providing a plurality of adjacent flow channels. These have been described with reference to the above drawings. There also may be provided peripheral support or stabilizer members also referred to in the foregoing drawings.

In this embodiment the inlet outlet module or return module where present may be provided with appropriate partitions for dividing the modules into a number of chambers which equal the number of different fluids being heated by the heat exchanger. When modified in this manner and when using a core element such as that described in FIG 2 above a heat exchanger in accordance with the invention may be placed in an automotive or engine intake or exhaust manifold or in a radiator tank for both industrial and automotive engines to cool both transmission and engine oils which may be mentioned as two different process fluids. In this case the operating fluid could be water. In another form of the invention as described above there may be provided sealing means associated with each end of a core of fluid flow apparatus constructed in accordance with the invention wherein each core end may include a plurality of elongate slots wherein each slot may terminate a respective flow passage in the core which may comprise operating fluid passages and process fluid passages. In this embodiment there may be provided sealing members which may include a plurality of fingers wherein each finger may be engageable in a respective elongate slot in such a manner as to permit passage of process and or operating fluid from one flow passage to an adjoining flow passage in the core. Preferably each sealing member includes a base portion from which said outwardly extending fingers may project. A suitable core for use in this aspect of the invention may be that described above in FIG 2. At each end of the core may be provided a plurality of substantially U shaped slots wherein each alternative slot is sealed at one longitudinal end and open at the other. In this arrangement the respective fingers of one or a pair of opposed sealing members as described above may be inserted into their mating array of slots through the respective open ends thereof. Each finger may be spaced from the base part of its mating U shaped slot so as to provide clearance of operating fluid from one flow passage in the core to an adjacent flow passage. In this arrangement there also may be provided a pair of opposed manifold components releasably secured to each other and retaining the abovementioned sealing members in position. Suitably there is also provided a cover plate releasably attached to the pair of manifold components and optionally a sealing gasket interposed between one end of the core and the cover plate. In relation to the heat exchangers shown in FIGS 1 and 2, it will be appreciated that for N passes of process fluid through the core, there will be N 1 passes of operating fluid or vice versa. Examples of process fluids which may be utilized in the heat exchanger of the invention are liquids such as engine oil, transmission oil and gases such as air. A suitable operating fluid is water. The heat exchanger of the invention will be found useful in marine applications, industrial applications and treatment of waste or process fluids such as the recovery of fats therefrom. Also by making it possible for maximum transfer of heat energy by making maximum benefit of the available working area of the apparatus, this enables one to obtain more effective control of other fluid parameters such as flow velocity, flow distribution and temperature gradient.
