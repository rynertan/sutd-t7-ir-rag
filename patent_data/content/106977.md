# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR ELECTROCHEMICALLY TREATING A SUBSTRATE

## Abstract
A laser enhanced electroplating system or etching sys tem or conventional electroplating or etching system in cludes a continuous electrochemical processing system with a sheet of material to be treated electrochemically passed from a supply roller to a plating bath and out over an exit roller with the plating system under automatic con trol. A rinse tank is also proved in series with the plating tank. The sheet to be treated electrochemically is coated in tank 21 with a protective film which prevents electrochemi cal action from occuring where it is present, but which sheet can be removed in a predetermined location. The protective film is removed where desired to provide a mask by means of a laser 27 which is scanned under automatic control. Then the plating or etching operation occurs through the openings in the mask. A rinse tank contains a solvent cap able of removing the mask from the sheet subsequent to the plating or etching operation. An array of lasers can be employed. An array of lasers can be multiplexed, syn chronously activated or pulsed. The electrochemical opera tion can be performed with the concomitant application of energy from the laser in order to enhance the chemical action in areas from which the masking protective film has been removed. The laser can be scanned by means of a mirror, which oscillates or can be fixed. The masking ma terial is composed of an organic material such as glycol phthalate, paraffin, photoresist, gelatin, etc.
