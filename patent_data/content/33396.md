# Segmented smoking pipe.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a segmented smoking pipe con sisting of a mouthpiece component 1 and a pipe bowl com ponent 4 , and aims at providing a smoking pipe of which the segmented or articulated parts can be brought into such a mutual or relative position that the opening of the pipe bowl 11 is covered furthermore into such a mutual position that, while the pipe is being smoked, the smoke inhaled can be blown back from the incandescent bed through the glowing tobacco and furthermore into a mutual position where the combination of the components exhibits a rectangular form in a lateral view. These aims are attained by providing the two compo nents 1,4 substantially in the form of blocks, a side eleva tional view of which exhibits a trapezoidal shape, which com ponents possess sufficiently flat wall portions 2,3,5,10 for allowing flush adjustment to each other in a number of mutual configurations, and furthermore by elastic connecting means 6,7 for moving and holding the components together in a number of mutual or relative configurations.

## Description
SEGMENTED SmOKING PIPEThe invention relates to a segmented smoking pipe consisting of a mouthpiece component and a pipe bowl component. Prior art smoking pipes of this kind possess these two components solely for the purpose of convenient cleaning of the pipe. The invention, however, aims at providing a segmented pipe having such a design that a number of hitherto unknown handling possibilities are available.A first purpose of the invention consists in providing a smoking pipe of which the segmented parts can be placed in such a mutual position that the opening of the pipe bowl is covered, serving the purpose of allowing the pipe to be safely put away for an interruption of smoking, or to be put in the pocket of a suit.A second purpose of the invention consists in providing a smoking pipe of which the segmented parts can be placed in such a mutual position that, while the pipe is being smoked, the smoke inhaled can be blown back from the incandescent bed through the glowing tobacco.A third purpose of the invention consists in providing a smoking pipe to the segmented parts of which such a mutual position can be given that smoking can take place solely with and through the mouthpiece component.The aforementioned aims are attained by providing the two components of a smoking pipe according to the invention substantially in the form of blocks, a side elevational view of which exhibits a trapezoidal shape, which components possess sufficiently flat wall portions for allowing flush adjustment to each other in a number of mutual configurations, and furthermore by elastic connecting means for mov ing and holding the components together in a number of mutual configurations.The elastic pulling means are preferably constituted by prior art elastic bands which can grasp about projections provided in the side walls of the components.The invention lends itself particularly well for giving such mutually adapted dimensions to the trapezoidal shape of the mouthpiece component and to the trapezoidal shape of the pipebowl component that, when the slanting sides of the two components butt on each other, a lateral view of the resultant combination has a rectangular shape.The mouthpiece component can be fitted advantageously on its upper side with a disc shaped prominence in such a position that, when the mouthpiece component is placed, with its upper side down, upon the upper face of the pipe bowl component, the top opening of the pipe bowl becomes covered with this prominence.In order to explain the invention, an example of embodiment is described hereinafter, reference being made to the drawing.Fig. 1 is a lateral view of a preferred embodiment of the invention fig. 2 is a top view along the arrow II in fig. 1 rig. 3 is a front view along the arrow III in fig. 1 fig. 4 is a lateral view of a first possible mutual position of the components of the smoking pipe according to the invention fig. 5 is a lateral view of a second possible mutual position fig. 6 shows a third possible mutual position fig. 7 shows a fourth possible mutual position.Figures 1, 2 and 3 show a smoking pipe 100 in its service position, with the mouthpiece component 1 butting with its large end face 2 on the small end face 3 of the pipe bowl component 4. The components 1 and 4 are pulled and held together by means of thin rubber bands which may be ordinary elastic bands that grasp about pins 7. The mouthpiece component 1 is provided with a bore 8, and the pipe bowl component 4 with a bore 9 which opens into the pipe bowl 11. The bores 8 and 9 connect to each other in the interface of the contact surfaces 2 and 3. Provided the surfaces 2 and 3 are adequately plane and the elastic bands 6 have sufficient tensile force, the place of connection of the bores 8 and 9 is sufficiently sealed for preventing any leakage during smoking. The recess 12 serves for better being able to hold the mouthpiece component 1 in the mouth.The number 13 indicates a raised portion of the wall 5 constituted by a convex curved disc.The edges 14 have been bevel finished for imparting an aesthetic appearance.Fig. 4 shows a mutual position of the two components 1 and 4 of the smoking pipe 100 according to the invention, with the two trapezoidal parts having dimensions that are so adjusted to each other that a lateral view of the combination exhibits a rectangle.In this position, the disc 13 fits in the top opening of the pipe bowl 11, causing this opening to be closed. If the components are folded together during smoking, i.e., when burning tobacco is contained in the pipe bowl 11, this will cause the fire to be extinguished, or at least to be so screened and cooled that the pipe can be safely put away or put in a pocket of the smokers clothing. It will be efficient to select a metal disc 13, since the use of such a material will be conducive to extinguish the fire more quickly. A suitable design of the disc will also allow it to be used for ramming down or compacting the glowing tobacco.The elastic bands 6 hold the slanting faces 5 and 10 vigorously against each other.Fig. 5 shows a mutual position of the components 1 and 4, where the mouthpiece component 1 connects with its bore 8 to the top opening of the pipe bowl 11. In this position, the smoker can blow back the smoke contained in his mouth by way of the bore 8 through the burning tobacco in the pipe bowl 11. The bore 9 then emits at point 15 a dense smoke, which intensely permeates the smoking space with the flavour of the tobacco consumed.Figs. 6 and 7 show two mutual positions of the components 1 and 4, both of which serve for smoking solely with the use of the mouthpiece 1 the other component 4 here only serves the purpose of forming a stand with the aid of which the pipe can from time to time be put down. If the pipe is used for this method of smoking, it is possible according to the invention to provide the bore 8 which opens into the face 2 with an expansion 16 into which the tobacco selected may be introduced. The invention is not restricted to the preferred embodiment described and illustrated. It is possible, for instance, to provide various bevels or rounded corners or edges on the compo nents 1 and 4, as well as other kinds of decorations, including further variations which still come within the scope of the invention. The smoking pipe according to the invention can furthermore be used for smoking such tobacco substituting products as chicory.The smoking pipe according to the invention can be manufactured from a wide variety of materials, including metals, wood and synthetics.
