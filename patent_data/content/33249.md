# Process for coating particles, and coated particles.

## Abstract
Electrostatographic carrier coating compositions which provide permeable carrier core particles with coatings that are more uniform in thickness and complete in integrity are obtained by employing a thixotropic lacquer. The nature of the thixotropic lacquer is such that its viscosity is low under high shear rates, but high under low shear rates as are found during the spreading of the lacquer over the carrier particles.
