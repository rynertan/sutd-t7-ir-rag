# Method for making an electrical contact to a silicon substrate through a relatively thin layer of silicon dioxide on the surface of the substrate and method for making a field effect transistor.

## Abstract
A buried electrical contact is made to a substrate 10 of monocrystalline silicon through a relatively thin layer 21 of silicon dioxide witout causing damage to the relatively thin layer 21 of silicon dioxide. This is accomplished through depositing a thin layer 22 of polycrystalline silicon over the relatively thin layer 21 of silicon dioxide prior to forming the opening 26 in the relatively thin layer 21 of silicon dioxide for the electrical contact to the substrate. After the thin layer 22 of polycrystalline silicon is deposited, an opening 25 is formed therein so that the thin layer 22 of polycrystalline silicon functions as a mask to etch a corresponding opening 26 in the relatively thin layer 21 of silicon dioxide. Then, a layer 28 of polycrystalline silicon is deposited over the exposed surface 27 of the substrate 10 and the thin layer 22 of polycrystalline silicon to form the electrical contact through the opening 26 in the relatively thin layer 21 of silicon dioxide to the substrate.
