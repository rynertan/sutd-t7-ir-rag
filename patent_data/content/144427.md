# METHOD OF DETERMINING SIGN OF INPUT DATA.

## Abstract
This method of determining the sign of input is used when preparing NC machining data wherein the configura tion of a part is specified by inputting directions , , , , , , , for each of various blocks b₁ b₈ of the configuration using configuration symbolic keys, and then dimensions for the various blocks of the part configuration are input so that NC machining data can be prepared using the input data. The method comprises the steps of inputting part configuration dimensions for a predetermined block in incremental quantities in the axial x, z directions determin ing the direction of the part configuration for that block and determining the sign of an incremental quantity input in accordance with the determined direction to obtain a signed incremental quantity.
