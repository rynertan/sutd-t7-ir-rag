Background Art Nonionic surfactants are generally included in laundry detergent compositions for their ability to attack greasy and oily soils. Cationic surfactants are also used in detergent compositions primarily to provide adjunct fabric care enefits a f t for the purp e of enhancing clean ng. Certair cation surfactante provide a germicidal san tization be ofit to washed surfaces see for example,U.S. Patent 2,742,424, Kopp, issued April 17, 1956 U.S.Patent 3,539,520, Cantor et al, issued November 10, 1970 and U.S. Patent 3,963,026, Lancz, issued June 22, 1976.Other cationic surfactants, such as ditallowalkyldimethylammonium chloride, are included in detergent compositions to provide a fabric softening benefit, as disclosed inU.S. Patent 3,607,763, Salmen et al, issued September 21, 1971 and U.S. Patent 3,644,203, Lamberti et al, issuedFebruary 22, 1972. Such components are also used to control static, as well as to soften laundered fabrics as, for example, in U.S. Patent 3,951,879, Wixon, issued April 20, 1976 and U.S. Patent 3,959,157, Inamorato, issued May 25, 1976. The compositions of the present invention have outstanding cleaning capabilities. In fulll scale laundry .tests, these compositions have been shown to be three to four times as effective in removing some typical greasy and oily soils than conventional laundry detergents, ncluding commercially available heavy duty liquid detergents containing a high proportion of nonionic surfactants.These same detergent compositions, with or without phosphate r other builder components, are also effective in removing cla soils at least well, and in some instances, substantially better than fully built conventional granular aundry detergent compositions, and, in addition provide a a e of fabric care benefits, such as fabric softening, static control and dy transfer inhibition, to the laundere fabrics. Thus, the compositions of the present invention provide the user with a well rounded cleaning and fabric care package.These results, which are vastly superior to these previously dem trated, particularly in the removal of greasy and oily soil are the r sult of a heretofore eco rized cleaning t ial of cortain selected cation surfactants the ozence of certain. selected nonionic surfactants in accordance with the cloud point and reduced cationic monomer concentration requirements specified herein. It is an object of this invention to provide laundry detergent compositions which yield outstanding greasy and oily soil and body soil removal. It is another object of this invention to provide laundry detergent compositions which have excellent particulate soil removal performance and fabric conditioning benefits, In add on to outstanding greasy and oily soil and body soil removal performance, in the presence or absence of builder components. It is a further object of this inventIon to provide detergent compositions which may be used in a variety of physical forms, such as liquid, paste, granular, sold, powder, or in conjunction with a carrier such as a substrate. It is a still futther object of this invention to provide a process for laundering fabrIcs to remove greasy and oily soil and body soil, , as well as particulate soil, using cationic and non surfactant containing detergent compositions. Disclosure of the Invention The present invention relates to phosphate free laundry detergent compositions or, alternatively, compositIons which contain levels of of phosphate which are no greater than about 20 , by weight, that comprise from about 5 to 100 , by weight, of a surfactant mixture consisting essentially of a a biodegradable nonionic surfactant having the formula R CC2H4 nOH wherein R is a primary or secondary alky chain of from about 8 to about 22 carbon atoms and. is an average of from about 2 to about 12, and having an HLB of from about 5 to about 17 and b a cationic surfactant, free of hydrazinium groups, having the formula Rm1Rx2YLZ wherein each R1 is an organic group containing a straight or branched alkyl or alkenyl group optionally substituted with up to 3 phe vl or hydroxy groups and optionally interrupted by up to 4 structures selected from the group consisting ofEMI4.1 and mixtures thereof, each R1 containing from about to about carbon etoms, and which may additionally contain up to about 22 ethylene oxide groups m is a number from 1 to 3 with each R having not more than 1 carbon atoms when m is 2 and not more than 11 carbon atoms when m is 3 each R2 is an alkyl or hydroxy alkyl group containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms or a benzyl group, with no more than one R2 in a molecule being benzyl x is from 2 to 11, the remainder of any carbon atom sitions being filled by hydrogens y is ele d from the group consisting ofEMI4.2 EMI4.3 erein is from 1 to 12, EMI5.1 wherein each p is from 1 to 12,EMI5.2 9 mixtures thereof, L is 1 or 2, the Y groups being separated by a moiety selected from the group consisting of R1 and R2 analogs having from one to about twenty two carbon tons and 2 free carbon single bonds when L is 2, Z is an anion in a number sufficient to give electrical neutrality, said cationic surfactant being at least water dispersible in admixture with said nonionic surfactant said composition having a p of at least 6.5 in the aqueous laundry solution, and being substantially free of oily hydrocarbon materials and cationic materials containing about 13 or more ethylene oxide groups, the ratio of said nonionic to said cationic surfactant being in the range of from 5.1.1 to about 100 1, and the cloud point , as described hereinafter, of said surfactant mixture being fro about 0 to about 95 C. Preferred compositions are nose in which the reduced cationic monomer concentration of said surfactant mixture is from about 0.002 to about 0.2. Preferred cationic surfactants are water soluble and have a critical micelle concentration CMC of greater than 10 ppm. The conventional fabric softening cationic materials having two alkyl chains each of about 18 carbon atoms are substantially insoluble and nay not form the sole cationic component of compositions of the present invention. The compositions cf the present invention are formulated so as to have a pH of at least 6.5 in the laundry solution at conventional usage concentrations in order to obtimine cleaning performance on greasy and oily soils acidie wash solution pH s tend to decrease performance such soils. Preferably, the compositions are alkaline in nature when placed in the laundry solution, and have a pH of greater than about . , particularly at least about 8. Some of the cationic nonionic systems of the present invention will attain optimum removal of greasy oily soils at these higher pHs. In such systems, overall performance may be improved by varying the wash solution pH during the l undering process. The compositions are free of oily hydrocarbon materials, such as many dry cleaning solvents, mineral oil, paraffin oil and kerosene, because these materials which are themselves oily in naturel nd the washing liquor with excessive oily material, thereby diminishing the cleaning offectiveness of the compositions of this invention. The cationic composent de free of hydrazinium groups due to their relatively high t xicity level which makes them unsuitable for use in the compositions of this invention. Preferred compositions contain nonionic surfactant to sationic surfactant ration of from to about 50 1, preferably from about 6 1 to about 1, particularly from about 6 1 to about 2 1. Greasy and oily soil removal is greatly enhanced at ration between about 8 1 to about 20 1, the improvement in performance generally being most oticeable as the amount of nonionic is increased so that the ratio of nonionic to cationis surfactant becomes greater than 5.1 1 and appreaches 1. Preferred compositions may contain mixed cationic and or mixed nonionic surfactant systems. The cationic surfactants should al be with the definition of the cationic surfactants set forth above although small amounts of other cationic materials cm be tolerated.The mixed nonionic surfactant systems may contain nononic surfactants which fall outside of the definition given above such as alcohol ethoxylates having an average of greater than 12 ethylene oxide groups per molecule as long as at least one of the nonionic surfactants in the mixture falls within the definition of the nonionic surfactants, and that nonionic surfactant is included in an amount so as to fall within the required ratio of nonionic to cationic surfactants.When the nonionic surfactant mixture contains a nonionic surfactant or surfactants which falls outside of the definition of nonionic surfactants, the ratio of the surfactant or surfactants within the above definition to that which does not fal within the definition preferably is in the range of from about to about 5 . The compositions of the present invention comprise, by weight, from about 5 to 10 CC, particularly from about 10 to about 95 , and most preferably from about 20 to about 90 of a mixture of the particularly defined nonionic and cationic surfactants in the ratios stated. It is preferred that the detergent compositions contain at lest about 1 of the .cationic component otherwise, sufficient cationic surfac tant may not be present in the wash solution to provide the desired cleaning and conditioning results.Further, preferred compositions do not connan n more than about 10 of the cationic component, due to cost and commercial availability considerations. Compositions of the present invention may contain up to about 60 of an electrolyte although low levels of from about . to 20 are preferred, , such as a detergent builder, as well as other adjunct components conventionally found in laundry detergent components, as more fully explained hereinafter. The compositions may be phosphatefree, although low level of a phosphate huilder which are less than 20 of the total composition, by weight, can be tolerated.It is preferred that the compositions be phosphate free for environmental ur oses. To the extent that phosphate,or other electrolytes are present in these compositions, they act primerily to affent cleaning performance by modifying the cloud point temperature of the nonionic cationic surfactant mixture, as described hereinafter. The primary use of the compositions of the present invention is in conventional home laundry operations. The compositions may also be used for other detergency purposes, including the pretreatment of greasy and oily spots and in industrial laundry operations. Processes for laundering fabrics with the compositions of the present invention, which provide superior greasy and oily soil removal and fabric care benefits, are taught herein. In these processes, the laun dry detergent compositions are used under temperature conditions such that the aqueous laundry solution is either at, or close to i.e., within about 20 C of the cloud point i.e., the temperature at which a phase rich in nonionic surfactant separates in the laundry solution of the nonionic cationic surfactant mixture.This can preferably be accomplished by form ulating those.nonionic cationic surfactant mixtures so that their cloud point falls between about 0 and 35 C, particularly from about 10 to 0 C, especially between about 2 and C, most sepecially from about 30 to about 50 C. uring the washing operation, the temperature of the laundry solution is held within this temperature range and within 0 C of the cloud point temperature. Performance is improved further where the temperature of the aqueous laundry solution is within about 0 C, more preferably within about 10 C, of the nonionic cationic surfactant mixture cloud ins temperature. Nonionic Component The nonionic surfactants used in the compositions of the present invention are hi dogradable and have the formulaR OC2H4 nOH, wherein R is a rimary, branched, or secondary alkyl chain of from about 5 to about 22, preferably fro about 10 to 20, atoms and n is an average of about 2 to about 12, particularly from about 2 to about 9.Although primarily linear alcohol ethoxylates e.g., alcohol ethoxylates produced from organic alcohols which contain about 20 2 methyl branched isomers, commercially available from Shell Chemical Company under the tradename Neodol are preferred from a per formance viewpoint, it is possible, using secondary alcohol ethoxylates, to formulate compositions which give both optlm clay and grease oil removal at about the same nonionic cationic ratio nonionic cationic ratio equals from 5.1 1 to about 15 1 .However, compositions which utilise these secondary alcohol ethoxylates tend to require higher usage concentrations, in the laundry solution in order to achieve their best pertormance, ran do compositions which include pr nary alcohol ethoxylates. The nonionics have an HLB hydrophilic lipophilic balance of from about 5 to about 17, preferably from about 6 to about 15. Optimum grease oil removal is achieved where the nonionic surfactant has an HLB of from about 9 to about 1 , particularly from about 10 to about 12. In such compositions, for optimum grease oil removal, it is preferred to use cationic surfactants which are relatively soluble, such as mono long chain e.g., C10 C19 alkyl quaternary ammonium compounds or quaternary ammonium compounds which contain a total of no more than about 2 carbon atoms in their R1 and R moieties. HLB is defined in detail in Nonionic Surfactants by M. C.

Preferred compositions of the present invention are substantially free of fat y acid polyglycol ether di aster compounds, such as polyethylene glycol 600 dioleate or polyethylene glycol 00 distearate. Such additives offer no advantage, and possibly even result in a disadvantage in terms of achieving the foil removal and fabric conditioning potential o the present invention.

In addition, the detergent compositions control static and soften fabrics laundered therewith, and inhibit the transfer of dyes in the wash solution. further, these novel cationic surfactants are environmentally disirable, since both their long chain alkyl segments and their nitrogen segments are biodegradable.

Another way of preparing these compounds is by the direct erification of the appropriate long chain ethoxylated rhoxylic acid together with 2 haloethanol or dimethyl u eihanol, in the presence of heat and an acid catalyst. reaction product formed is then quaternized with halide or used to quaternize trimethylamine to form e desired ester compound. ormalation Criteria Utiliting the nonionic and cationic components, fined above, preferred compositions of the present nvention are formulated using the guidance provided by s ednced Monomer Concentration CR of the cationic p nent in the laundry solution. Specifically, the ection of a CR value for a given nonionic and cationic will determine the ratio in which to combine ose surfactants.The Reduced Monomer Concentration surfactant is obtained by dividing the concentration factant monomer present in the aundry solution y e tical micelle concentration C , of the factant. As used in this application, CMC s are cermined at 105 F in water containing grains gallon mixed hardness, unless otherwise stated. The ed cationic monomer concentration of the nonionic nic surfactant mixture is efined by equations 1 through 3 , given below.The nonionic cationic surfactant mixtures preferred in the present Invention are those having reduced monomer concentrations in the range of from about 0.009 to about 0.2, preferably from about 0.002 to about 0.15, and most preferably from about 0.002 to about 0.08. As nonionic and cationic components of greater purity are utilized, the narrower CR ranges become more preferred. The cor ert of reduced monomer concentration, in a g p ster, as a quantity which normalizes ex t of a surfactant ontc a fabric surface the cri ic l element in the removal of greasy ily soils is discussed in Tamamushi and Tamaki,Proceedings of the Second International Congress ofSurface Activity, III, 449, Academic Press, Inc. 1957 .The equations below extend this concept of reduced monomer concentration to multi component systems, utilizing surfactant monomer concentrations. The concept of surfactant monomer concentration is derived from the discussion In Clint, J. Chem. Soc. Far. Trans., 1, 71, 1327 1975 , incorporated herein by reference, in the context of an ideal solution, and Is based on the following quadratio equation equation 11 inClint EMI26.1 wherein in the above and the following equations C total analytical surfactant concentra tion F the solution n..oles l. sum of the cationic and nonionic concentrations C1 C2 wherein 1 denotes nonionic rfactant and 2 denotes cationic surfactant c1 critical micelle concentration CMC of nonionic surfactant moles 1.

This procedure was repeated for a large number of such tests, over varying usage conditions. The x values obtained were then used to solve for the cationic er concentrations using the following equation c2m 1 x f2c2 2 The CR value as then calculated using equation 3 . CR c2m c2 3 The CR values obtained cover a large number of combina tions and ratios of various nonionic and cationic surfactants, at various concentrations and temperatures, which have been evaluated for their ability to clean greasy oily soils. The examination of the resulting data revealed that for a given system the optimum cleaning of greasy oily soils was found at a CR value of from about 0.002 to about 0.2. This range of CR Ci.e., 0.002 to 0.2 can then be used to determine the range of optimum nonionic cationic ratios for any given combination of non Ionic surfactant and cationic surfactant, for the desired wash concentration within the overall wash concentration range of from 100 parts per million ppm to 10,000 ppm of surfactant.This calculation is carried out in the following manner, where ss, CR, c1 , c2 , M1 and M2 are known for a given nonionic cationic surfactant pair a for a given nonionic surfactant, cationic sur factant, and for each end of the CR range, solve for x using the equation l x eSX CR by standard numerical iterative techniques to an error in x of less than 0.001 b find the range of .from the equation Y 1 x x 1 Y 1000 x x 1 M1 M2 W using 100 ppm and 10,000 ppm as the boundary values for W, for each cnd of the CR range c the nonionic cationic ratio NCR range for optimum performance is then within the range obtained by substituting the boundary values for Y into the formula Put another way, stcps b and c may be combined into a single equation which may be solved directly for the NCR.EMI30.1 The above procedure is relevant only to wash solution concentrations above the critical micelle concentration of the nonionic cationic mixture. For concentrations which are as high as about five times critical micelle concentration, CR is essentially independent of concentration.This means that for conventional laundry usage concentrations e.g., 100 ppm to 10,000 ppm, and especially from about 250 ppm to about 3,000 ppm , the CR of most commercial cationic, nonionic surfactant mixtures wherein the cationic component has a CMC of less than about 100 ppm, measured at 105 F Water containing 7 grain gallon of mixed calcium and magnesium hardness will be independent of the actual usage concentration, so that using a concencration of about 1,000 ppm in the above calculation will b a satisfactory approximation for the entire ras As used herein, if f a concentration range is not pecified, the 1,000 ppm CR is meant. 5y way of example, the optimum ratio for grease oil removal for Composition A of Example I, herein, given CR calculated below.

The cloud point of the nonionic cationic mixture and in preferred cmbodiments me nonionic cationic mixture plus any electrolytes present in the composition falls between about 0 and about 95 C, preferably between about 10 and about 70 C, more preferably between about 20 and about 65 C, especially between about 30 and about 50 C.For cold water er detergency, the surfactant mixture should have a l ud peint between about 0 and about 25 C. The fact a a composition has a cloud point within these temperature ranges assures that the composition can be utilized under laundry temperature conditions to achieve uistanding removal of greasy oily soils. If a compo tion does not have a cloud point within the temperature ge specified, it will not yield the outstanding ning of the present invention inside that temperature range.The compositions ill exhibit their best grease oil removal performance hen the temperature of the wash solution in which they are s ralis within about 200C, preferably within about C. und most preferably within about 100C, of the loud oint of the nonionic cationic surfactant mixture. t another way, the laundry solution temperature range ich the preferred compositions deliver optimum R, C . emoval ics between the cloud point temper ure f the system in the absence of the cationic ent, and about 30 C, preferably about 25 C, most eferabl about 200C, above that cloud point temperature. As used herein, the term cloud point means the e at which a graph which ploys the light at er ng intensity of the composition versus wash solution temperature begins to sharply increase to its maximum value, under the following experimental conditions The light scattering intensity is measured using a Model vM 12397 Photogoniodiffusometer, manufactured bySocietè Francaise d instruments de controle et d analyses,France the instrument being hereinafter referred to as SOFICA . Tlle SOFICA sample cell and its lid are washed with hot acetone and allowed to dry. The surfactant mixture is made and put into solution with distilled water at a concentration of 1000 ppm. Approximately a 15 ml. sample of the solution is placed into the sample cell, using a syringe with a 0.2 nucleopore filter. The syringe needle passes through the sample cell lid, so that the cell interior is not exposed to atomospheric dust.The sample is kept in a variable temperature bath, and both the bath and the sample dre subject to constant stirring. The bath temperature is heated using the SOFICA s heater and cooled by the addition of ice heating rateal C minute the temperature of the sample is determined by the temperature of the bath.The light scattering 900 angle intensity of the sample is then determined at various temperatures, using a green filter and no polarizer in the SOFIA. The preferred nonionic and cat ionIc components used in the present compositions are chosen, combined, and used based on three basic criteria 1 the final composition must satisfy the cloud point criteria, given above, and should be such that the surfactant mixture cloud point temperature is within about 20 C of normal wash solution temperatures, 2 the reduced cat ionic monomer concentration of the surfactant mixture preferably falls within the range defined above and 3 the concentration, of the detergent composition in the wash solution should be sufficient to give the desired cleaning performance under normal laundering temperatures. e 5e in the present invent gr t nonionic surfactants which have elative low CMCs and low cloud points i.e., the temperature at which an aqu ous solution of the surfactant exhibits turbidity . These surfactants can be used to prepare detergent compositions, laundry solutions of which, at lower temperatures, will form the desired nonlonic cation mixture cloud point without requiring the addition of other ingredients, such as electrolytes or anionic surfactants.Such detergent compositions make it easier to fulfill the cloud point requirements set forth herein, and yield outstanding reinoval of greasy and oily soils from fabrics. In formulating and utilizing the compositions of the present invention, it is preferred, for typicalAmerican automatic washing conditions, that the nonionic surfactant, the cationic surfactant, and any additional components be chosen and used in amounts such that the temperature at which the detergent composition in the aqueous laundry solution has a cloud point, as defined above, will be between about 3000 and 50 C, preferably t about 45 C. Where the compositions are used under different washing conditions, the compositions are formulated such that, at the desired use concentration, t exhibit their cloud point at a temperature which is within about 20 C of the desired washing temperature,Thus, for example, in Japan where washing temperatures a e generally lo er than those used in the United .States , the compositions are desirably formulated so as to have their cloud point close to about 15 C. Thc cloud point temperature for a given composition in the wash solution depends upon the physical and emicul properties such as CMC and solubility of the t nic, nonionic and additional components included in that composition, and may be l wer d by increasing the alkyl hain lengths of the nonionic or cationic components, by decreasing the d ce of ethoxylation of the nonionic component, er ad ing as phosphates, polyphosphonates, perborates, carbonates or sulfates, particularly i relatively low amounts such as from about 1 to about 15 of a given composition . More specifically, it is preferred that th detergent compositions OL the present invention, where used 10 the aqueous laundry solution, have cloud points which fall within about 15 C, preferably within about 10 C, and most preferably within out 50C, of the temperature or the laundry solution. It has ben found that when these laundry solution tempera.ure cloud point relaticnships are met, the greasy and oily soil removal capacity of the laundry solution increases dramatically. Although not intending to be bound by theory, it is believed that when a detergent composition of the present invention is in a laundry solution with oily soiled fabrics, the cationic component is adsorbed onto tne fabrIc, thereby neutralizing the negative charge on the fabric. This charge neutralization enhances the adsorption of the nonionic surfactant onto the fabric, thereby causing the roll up of the oily soil. The soil is then easily removed by agitation.It is by formu lating cationic nonionic surfactant mixtures which satisfy the cloud point and the preferred reduced cationic monomer concentration requirements that this mechanism, and hence, greasy oily soil removal, is optimized.

In nonionic cationic systems, the ratio of the total cationic and nonionic components to the amide component included, is in the range of from about 5 1 to about 50 1, preferably from about 8 1 to about 25 1.

The compositions of the present invention may additionally contain monoethanolamine, diethanolamine, or triethanolamine components in amounts up to about 30 , preferably from about 5 to about 20, These components are useful as alkalinity sources and in formulating clear homogeneous liquid products which satisfy the cloud point requirements when placed in an aqueous laundry solution. Compositions of the present invention may be manufactured and used in a variety of physical forms, such as solid, powder, granular, paste, or liquid. The compositions are particularly well suited for incorporation into substrate articles for use in the home laundering process,These articles consist of a water insoluble substrate which releaseably incorporates an effective amount, preferably from about 20 to 80 grams of the detergent composition of te present invention. A particular preferred substrate article incorporates a bleaching component and a bleaen activact en the substrate, together with the nonionic cationic Jur factant mixture. A particularly preferred composition of the present invention is an aqueous heavy duty liquid laundry compos 1 tion containing from about 10 to about 50 , preferably about 15 to 40 , of the nonionic surfactant, from about 1 to about 10 , preferably about 1 to 6 , of the cationic surfactant and which additionally contains from about 5 to about 30 , preferably about 10 of monoethanolamine, diethanolamine, triethanolamine, or mixtures thereof. These compositions may also contain from about 3 to about 20 of an anionic surfactant, particularly one of the ethoxylated or non ethoxylated alkyl sulfate variety.One embodiment Oi such a composition contains monoethanolamine, coconut trimethyl ammonium chloride as at least a portion of the cation component, and a mixture of the condensation product of secondary C12 alcohol with an average of 7 moles of ethylene oxide together with the condensation product of seconda C12 alcohol with an average or 5 moles of ethylene oxide, in a ratio of higher etboxylated nonionic to lower ethoxylated nonionic of about 3 1, as the nonionic surfactant. In these compositions, the amounts and ratios of the componen may be varied so as to produce a clear, homogeneous product which exhibits the required cloud point characteristIcs n the aqueous laundry solution. Laundry Processes In its broadest aspect, this invention envisions a process for cleaning solid surf aces soiled with greasy and or oily materials utilizing an aqueous laundry solution comprising from about 0.01 to about 0.3 by weight or a mixture of a nonionic surfactant and a cation c rfacta wherein the reduced monomer concentration of the cationic surfactant is from about 0.002 to about 0.2, e ably about 0.002 to about an mo t preferabl pout 0.102 to about 0.06 e of the o o g within about 200C, preferably within about 15 C more preferably within about 100C of The cloud point of Lh nonionic , cationic surfactant mixture. It is, generally, at the anoint where the laundry solution temperature is equal to tna cloud point that a given system will give its best greasy oily soil removal performance. Particularly preferred laundry solutions are those in which the ratio of the nonionic surfactant to cationic surfactant is from 5.1 1 to about 100 1, particularly from 5.1 1 to about 50 1, more particularly from about 6 1 to about 40 1, especially from about 6 1 to about 20 1. Prior to this invention, it was totally unexpected that combinations of nonionic and cationic surf acwtants, even with a builder present, could provide cleaning of either greasy and oily soils or particulate soils which was competitive with commercial fully built anionic detergents. Further, there was no indication that reduced cationic monomer concentration and cloud point were critical elements to obtaining removal of greasy and oily soils. It was therefore totally unexpected that such combinations could be used to provide superior performance even in low or non phosphate systems, as well as in systems containing no builder or relatively non effective builders. Such performance is obtained where the newly discovered cloud point and reduced cationic monomer concentration criteria, set forth herein, are met in the washing process. The process requires that the laundry solution be near the cloud point temperature of the detergent composition, which in general is well above the nonionicrs CMC. The cationic surfactant concentration should not be too low or too high above the cationic s C. .C for optimal greasy oily soil removal performance. These criteria and the numerous other constraints set by considerations, such as co ogleal desirability and safety, help define the preferred compositions set forth herein. With the process of this invention, it is also possible to achIeve superior particulate soil removal if sufficient cationic surfactant is present in the laundry solution. It may be necessary to balance the need for a relatively high concentration of cationic surfactant e.g., at least about 50 ppm with other factors and It will be recognized that for very high nonionic cationic ratios it may not be possible, at present usage concentr ions, to achieve the best particulate soil removal. However, tne particulate soil removal and greasy oily soil removal achieved by these processes are superior to that provded bv any known commercial detergent while permitting the detergent formulator to meet the ecological and safety concerns of the present day. In addition to the benefits found in cleaning, the present invention provides an impressive array of secondary, but extremely desirable, benefits which are almost unknown in the conventional anionic detergent compositions ar. a processes of the prior art. For example, depending upon the identity and concentration of the cationic componer.t it is possible to provide the benefits known in the prl .r rt for such cationics, e.g., antibacterial action, antistat effects, softening effects for textiles, ad an e fe not heretofore noted, the prevention or minimization of the transfer of certain. dyes from one fabric to another in the cleaning process. In general, the compositions of the present invention are used in the laundering process by forming an aqueous solution containing from about 0.01 100 ppm to 0.32 3000 ppm , preferably from about 0.02 to 0.2 , most preferably from about 0.03 to about 0. 15E, of the nonionic cationic detergent mixture, within the cloud point and reduced monomer concentration limitations defined above, and agit ting the soiled fabrics in that solution. The fabrics are hen rinsed and dried.When used in this manner the co Dos I tions, of the present invention yield exception ly greasy and oily soil removal, as well as paticulate s il removal and fabric conditioning performance en the compositions ot the rese l ntion are un fore n laundry, industrial laundry or hard surface cleaning operations, concentrations as high as about 2 may be used.

The three swatches were then added to an average six pound load of clean mixed fabrics, containing cotton, polyester, and cotton polyester fabrics, and the load was washed in a full scale Kenmore washer using one of the compositions described above. Each of the compositions was added to the washing solution at a usage concentration of about 0.1 . Composition A had a pH of 8 in the washing solution, and Composition B had a pH of about 9.7. The wash water was at a temperature of 1050F 40 C and contained 9 grains per gallon of natural hardness. After the laundering was complete, each of the swatches was graded for the removal of each stain on .n 1 to 10 scale, with 0 signifying complete removal and 10 signifying no removal at all. For each treatment, the total of the clay removal grades were added up and the total of the grease oil removal grades were added up.Thus, for each troatment the clay removal score could range from 0, for complete removal, up to 30, for no removal and for the grease and oil stains, the scores could range from 0, for complete removal, up to 90, for no removal.

EXAMPLE V The relationship between greasy oily soil removal performance and cloud point laundry solution temperature was demonstrated in the following manner. The detergent composition tested was a mixture of the condensation product of C12 alcohol with 5 moles of ethylene oxide and C16 alkyl . tri methylammonium chloride, in a nonionic cationic ratio of 19 1. The composition was used at a concentration of 1000 ppm in distilled water. The greasy oily soil removal performance of this composition was tested, as a function of wash water temperature, using a Tergotometer having one 10 minute wash cycle and two 2 minute rins e cycles. For each test, two 7.5 cm square desized polyester knit swatches were weighed. . The swatches were then stained with 200 mg. technical grade triolein containing 0.000393 Oil Red O, for visualization , and weighed again. The swatches were allowed to age for about 2 hours, and were washed in the Tergotometer 1000 ml water 1000 ppm of te detergent composition , air dried, and reweighed. The percent triolcin removal was calculated using the formula 100 x owt soiled wt washed wt soiled wt clean .This procedure was repeated at a series of wash water temperatures. The light scattering intensity of the detergent composition, as a function of solution temperature, was de.termined as follows The light scattering intensity was measured using aModel MV 12397 Photo oniodiffusometer, manufactured bySociete Francaise d instruments de controle et d analyses,France the instrument being hereinafter referred to asSOFICA . The SOFICA sample cell and its lid were washed with hot acetone and allowed to dry.The surfactant mixture was made and put into solution, with distilled water, at a concentration of 1000 ppm. Approximately a 15 ml. ample of the solution was placed ito the sample cell, using a syringe with a 0.2 nucleopore filter. The syringe .needle passed through the sample cell lid, so that the cell interior was not exposed to atomospheric dust The sample was kept in a variable temperature bath, and both the bath and the sample were subject to constant stirring. The bath temperature was heated using the SOFICA s heater and cooled by the addition of ice heating rate 1 C minute the temperature of the sample was determined by the temperature of the bath. The light scattering intensity of the sample was then determined at various temperatures, using a green filter and no polarizer in the SOFICA. The results of these tests are summarized in the following table. temperature o Triolein Scattering C Removal Intensity 22 52 2 26 2 30 90 32 3 36 4 40 92 45 5 48 8 50 97 13 52 16 56 25 58 35 60 62 60 53 82 65 100 70 38 These data show that the optimum trio loin removal for this detergent composition occurs in a wash solution having a temperature of about 500C this is approximately the same temperature at which the light scattering of the solution begins to sharply y increase in moving toward its maximulr. value i.e., the cloud point of the nonionic catlonl. surfactant mixture . It is therefore seen that by us inc this detergent composition in a wash solution having a temperature close i.e., within about 200C to the o sition1s cloud point, the maximum triolein removal fcr that composition is. achieved.
