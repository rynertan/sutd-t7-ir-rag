# Double feed roll lift mechanism.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a hydraulically actuated feed roll lift mechanism for feeds utilized to feed strip stock into a machine, such as a mechanical press. Regulated hydraulic pressure acting against a piston 104 that is connected to one of the feed rolls 48 through a yoke 72 forces the feed roll against the stock to grip the stock and cause an increment thereof to be fed into the press when the rolls are rotated. A roll opening cam 174 , which is connected to the press crankshaft, advances a small piston 144 to displace oil against the other side of the piston while the stock is at rest to thereby separate the rolls during the time that the dies are in contact with the stock in the press. The time at which roll separation is initiated is controlled by adjusting the angular position of the cam 174 on its shaft 162 , as by releasing a frictional lock mechanism 178 , rotating the cam to the desired position, and then again locking it in place. The invention is particularly related to a double feed roll system wherein opposing feed rolls are located at the infeed and outfeed sides of the press so that the stock is both pushed and pulled therethrough. Identical cam roll lift mechanisms are utilized for both of the pairs of feed rolls wherein the cams 174 , 176 are mounted on the same shaft 162 and can be adjusted independently of each other. This enables the infeed and outfeed rolls to be separated at different times during the cycle of the press.
