# IMPACT RESISTANT COMPOSITES WITH ELASTOMERIC FIBERS

## Abstract
A composite consisting essentially of a polymer matrix and thermoplastic elastomeric fibers is disclosed. During pre paration elastomeric fibers are embedded in polymer or polymer precursor under from about 0 tension to tension only sufficient to eliminate slack and develop tension as the com posite is formed. The composite is impact resistant and cap able of elongation.
