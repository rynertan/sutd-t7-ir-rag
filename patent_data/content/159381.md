## Description
HERBICIDAL SYSTEM The present invention relates to a herbicidal system. More particularly, it relates to a herbicidal system comprising a N 4 chloro 2 fluoro 5 isopropoxy phenyl 3,4,5,6 tetrahydrophthalimide hereinafter referred to as Compound I of the formula EMI1.1 b at least one of S ethyl N,N diisobutylthiolcarbamate hereinafter referred to as butylate and S ethyl N,Ndi n propylthiolcarbamate hereinafter referred to as EPTC and c N,N diallyl 2,2 dichloroacetamide hereinafter referred to as R 25788 , which exerts a highly enhanced herbicidal activity against a wide variety of weeds without causing any material phytotoxicity to crop plants, particularly corn maize . In recent years, there are used a great number of chemicals having herbicidal activities in order to exterminate or control the undesired vegetation of weeds. However, the kinds of weeds are very broad and, in consequence, the germination thereof as well as the stages of growth differ from each other. The herbicidal effects of conventional herbicidal agents are thus quite restricted in general. In view of such situation, the appearance of any herbicidal agent which exerts a strong herbicidal activity against a wide variety of weeds without any material phytotoxicity to crop plants has been highly demanded. As a result of the extensive study, it has now been found that the associated use of a Compound I with b at least one of butylate and EPTC and c R 25788 produces a highly enhanced herbicidal activity against a wide variety of weeds including narrow leaved weeds and broad leaved weeds in the field of principal crop plants without causing any material phytotoxicity to those crop plants, particularly corn. In comparison with the sole use of each of said active ingredients, enhancement of the herbicidal activity on such associated use is very remarkable. Thus, a clear and definite synergistic effect is observed in said associated use. In addition, it may be noted that the phytotoxicity in corn as observed on the sole application ofCompound I in a large quantity for the purpose of extermination of perennial weeds is much alleviated whenCompound I is applied with butylate and or EPTC andR 25788. Compound I is known to exert a herbicidal activity with high selectivity to corn EP A 0061741 .Butylate and EPTC are also known to be useful as selective herbicides The Pesticide Manual edited by C.R. Worthing and published by The British Crop Protection Council, 6thEd., pages 71 and 237 1979 . Further, R 25788 is known as a detoxicant The Pesticide Annual1 as referred to above, page 162 1979 . However, the associated use of Compound I with butylate and or EPTC and R 25788 has never been attempted, and the production of said synergistic effect on such associated use has never been expected. For efficient production of the synergistic effect, the associated use of Compound I as the component a and the combination of at least one of butylate and EPTC as the component b and R 25788 as the component c is preferred to be in a weight proportion of about 1 0.2 60, particularly of about 1 0.5 20. The mixing ratio of at least one of butylate and EPTC to R 25788 is normally from about 5 to 20, preferably about 12, in weight. The term associated use as herein employed is intended to mean the application of Compound I as the component a , at least one of butylate and EPTC as the component b and R 25788 as the component c in any appropriate manner, e.g. in combination or separately, simultaneously or stepwise, etc. Said essential active ingredients, i.e. the components a , b and c may be applied as such but are usually applied in conventional preparation forms. They may be thus formulated, for instance, in a single composition comprising the components a , b and c for the combined application or two compositions, of which one comprises the component a and the other comprises the components b and c , for the separate application. In any event, each of said compositions may contain from about 1 to 95 by weight, preferably from about 5 to 80 by weight, of the active ingredient s . In addition to the above active ingredients, the composition may contain a solid or liquid carrier or diluent. Any surface active or auxiliary agent may be also contained therein. Thus, the composition may be formulated in any conventional formulation form such as emulsifiable concentrate, wettable powder, suspension or granules. As the solid carrier or diluent, there may be used kaolin clay, attapulgite clay, bentonite, terra alba, pyrophyllite, talc, diatomaceous earth, calcite, wallnut shell powder, urea, ammonium sulfate, synthetic hydrated silicon dioxide, etc.Examples of the liquid carrier or diluent are aromatic hydrocarbons e.g. xylene, methylnaphthalene , alcohols e.g. isopropanol, methylene glycol, cellosolve , ketones e.g. acetone, cyclohexanone, isophorone , vegetable oils e.g. soybean oil, cotton seed oil , dimethylsulfoxide, acetonitrile, water, etc. The surface active agent used for emulsification, dispersion or spreading may be any of the anionic and nonionic type of agents. Examples of the surface active agent include alkylsulfates, alkylarylsulfonates, dialkylsulfosuccinates, phosphates of polyoxyethylenealkylaryl ethers, polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers, polyoxyethylene alkylaryl ethers, polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene block copolymers, sorbitan fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters, etc. Examples of the auxiliary agents include ligninsulfonates, sodium alginate, polyvinyl alcohol, gum arabic, CMC carboxymethyl cellulose , PAP isopropyl acid phosphate , etc. Practical embodiments of the composition are illustratively shown in the following Formulation Examples wherein part s are by weight. Formulation Example 1 One part of Compound I , 9 parts of a mixture ofR 25788 and butylate 1 12 , 14 parts of polyoxyethylene styrylphenyl ether, 6 parts of calcium dodecylbenzenesulfonate and 70 parts of xylene are well mixed while being powdered to obtain an emulsifiable concentrate. Formulation Example 2 A Fifty parts of Compound I , 3 parts of calcium ligninsulfonate, 2 parts of sodium laurylsulfate and 45 parts of synthetic hydrated silicon dioxide are well mixed while being powdered to obtain a wettable powder. B Ten parts of a mixture of R 25788 and butylate 1 12 , 14 parts of polyoxyethylene styrylphenyl ether, 6 parts of calcium dodecylbenzenesulfonate and 70 parts of xylene are well mixed while being powdered to obtain an emulsifiable concentrate. Formulation Example 3 A Two parts of Compound I , 1 part of synthetic hydrated silicon dioxide, 2 parts of calcium ligninsulfonate, 30 parts of bentonite and 65 parts of kaolin clay are well mixed while being pulverized. The resulting powder is admixed with water and dried to obtain granules. B Ten parts of a mixture of R 25788 and EPTC 1 12 , 14 parts of polyoxyethylene styrylphenyl ether, 6 parts of calcium dodecylbenzenesulfonate and 70 parts of xylene are well mixed while being powdered to obtain an emulsifiable concentrate. In order to improve the herbicidal activity, the composition may be used with other herbicides. Besides, it may be used in combination with insecticides, acaricides, nematocides, fungicides, plant growth regulators, fertilizers, soil improvers, etc. The dosage of the active ingredients may vary depending on prevailing weather conditions, soil involved, formulation used, mixing proportion of each active ingredient, crop and weed species, etc. In general, however, the total amount of the components a , b and c is favored to be within a range of 12 to 80 grams per are, preferably 20 to 60 grams per are. The composition may be applied as such or in any diluted form, particularly with water, to the area where weeds are grow or will grow, particularly to the field of corn, by any per se conventional procedure such as foliar treatment or soil treatment, mixing treatment or surface treatment, etc. Usually, soil treatment is favorable. In case of the composition being formulated into an emulsifiable concentrate, wettable powder or suspension, it is normally diluted with water and applied over the top at a volume of 1 to 10 liters per are to the foliage of the crop plants or weeds which germinate or have germinated. The dilution may include, in addition to the above mentioned surface active agent, any spreading or auxiliary agent such as polyoxyethylene resin acid esters, ligninsulfonates, abietic acid, dinaphthylmethanedisulfonates, paraffin and the like.The composition being formulated into granules is generally applied as such. While a sufficient herbicidal activity can be expected by single soil treatment, a more prominent herbicidal activity may be produced when the application is made stepwise. Particularly recommendable are to apply first the composition comprising the components b and c , especially in a weight proportion of 12 1, by soil mixing treatment i.e. the components b and c being mixed into soil and, after planting crop plants, to apply the component a by soil surface treatment i.e. the component a being applied to the surface of soil , whereby the broad leaved weeds as well as the narrow leaved weeds are satisfactorily exterminated at their small doses without causing any material phytotoxicity to principal plants, particularly corn. The herbicidal system of the invention can exterminate or control a variety of weeds such as broad leaved weeds and the narrow leaved weeds, of which typical examples are as follows common lambsquarters Chenopodium album , redroot pigweed Amaranthus retroflexus , smartweed Polygonum sp. , common chickweed Stellaria media , common purslane Portulaca oleracea , cocklebur Xanthium strumarium , jimsonweed Datura stramonium , velvetleaf Abutilon theophrasti , tall morningglory Ipomoea purpurea , hemp sesbania Sesbania exaltata , prickly sida S ida spinosa , black nightshade Solanum nigrum , field bindweed Convolvulus arrensis , common milkweed Asclepias syriaca , green foxtail Setaria viridis , large crabgrass Digitaria sanguinalis , annual bluegrass Poa annua , bermudagrass Cynodon dactylon , goosegrass Eleusine indica , barnyardgrass Echinochloa crus galli , johnsongrass Sorghum halepense , purple nutsedge Cyperus rotundus , yellow nutsedge Cyperus esculentus , etc. The practical herbicidal activity of the system of the invention will be explained in further detail with reference to the following Test Examples wherein the growth controlling percentage was determined by weighing the aerial parts of the test plants fresh weight and making calculation according to the following equation EMI8.1 tb Growth SEP SEP SEP Fresh SEP weight SEP of SEP test tb controlling SEP SEP 1 SEP plant SEP in SEP treated SEP plot tb percentage SEP 9 SEP SEP Fresh SEP weight SEP of SEP test SEP x SEP 100 tb SEP SEP plant SEP in SEP untreated SEP plot tb Test Example 1 The seeds of tall morningglory were sowed in a cylindrical pot diameter, 10 cm length, 10 cm filled with field soil and covered therewith.
