# OIL BASED LUBRICANT COMPOSTIONS

## Abstract
This invention relates to oil based lubricant compositions containing mixed esters of trimellitic acid. The ester mixture may be produced either by mixing individual esters of linear al cohols with those of branched chain alcohols, or by forming a mixed ester by reacting trimellitic acid with a mixture of linear and branched chain alcohols. The product ester mixture re duces the viscosity ratio and imparts acceptable low tempera ture hydrocarbon compatibility to the lubricants.
