# MIXER

## Abstract
An improved mixer is proposed which has a casing, a rotary shaft extending horizontally through the casing, an outer helical blade mounted on the rotary shaft for moving the materials in one direction, an inner helical blade mounted on the rotary shaft for moving the materials in the opposite direction, and an auxiliary screw blade for moving the materials in the same direction as the inner blade does.
