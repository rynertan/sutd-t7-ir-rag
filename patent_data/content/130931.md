# DEGRADATION SENSING AND SHUT DOWN MEANS FOR REFRIGERATION MOTOR COMPRESSOR UNITS

## Abstract
Means for shutting down operation of an enclosed mo tor compressor unit for air conditioning and heat pump ser vice consists in immersing a pair of spaced electrodes having a potential gradient thereacross in the refrigerantoil mixture in the unit enclosure and in employing the ion and electron flow across the electrodes resulting from contami nants in the mixture to break the motor energizing circuits through relay means, and in the provision of a normally open fusible switch responsive to close in response to a predeter mined high motor temperature and through relay means break the motor energizing circuit. In a simplified modifica tion, the immersed electrodes are directly connected across the power supply leads and cause a fusible link connected in the power supply leads to open and break the motor energiz ing circuit when sufficient conduction across the electrodes occurs.
