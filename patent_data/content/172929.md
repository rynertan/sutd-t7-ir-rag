# Three dimensional time of flight positron emission camera system.

## Abstract
An improved sensitivity, multiple detector ring positron emission camera utilizing time of flight information to local ize the position of a detected annihilation is disclosed. The annihilations detected along each cross coincidence line between any detector in one ring and a plurality of detectors on the other rings are included in the data of the image slices by determining the nearest measurement position on the plane or interplane slice to the actual location of the annihilation for summing therewith. The positional uncer tainty function which characterizes the error in the mea surement of the true position of an annihilation along a coincidence line is weighted by an attenuation uniformity coefficient to determine the contributions to those measure ment positions shich lie closest to the coincidence line between the detectors detecting the annihilation.
