# Synthesis gas.

## Abstract
Carbon dioxide is removed from a raw gas containing hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and intermediate boiling gas, e.g. nitrogen, to give a gas suitable for use as a synthesis gas by a wet carbon dioxide removal process, and the resultant carbon dioxide depleted gas is subjected to pressure swing adsorption PSA to remove some, or all, of the intermediate boiling gas and the bulk of any residual carbon dioxide. The PSA waste gas is used to strip the absorbent liquid in the regeneration of the latter in the wet carbon dioxide removal process. The process is of particular utility in the manufacture of ammonia synthesis gas from a raw gas containing an excess of nitrogen, particularly as prepared by primary secondary reforming shift of a carbonaceous feedstock with partial bypass of the primary reforming stage.
