# Process for producing spherical carrier particles for olefin polymerisation catalyst, catalyst comprising such carrier particles, and use of such catalyst in olefin polymerisation.

## Abstract
Catalysts comprising a transition metal compound supported on a carrier, and an organometallic compound have been used in the polymerisation of olefins. When the carrier particles are spherical olefin polymers can be produced in the form of spherical particles, but known spherical carrier particles either are insufficiently robust or are difficult and expensive to prepare. In accordance with the invention spherical carrier particles are prepared by i forming a suspension of molten particles of an adduct of a halogen containing magnesium compound and an active hydrogen containing organic compound in an organic liquid medium in the presence of at least one auxiliary component selected from surface active agents and siloxanes, and ii quenching the resulting suspension to solidify the adduct particles. The resulting spherical carrier particles are robust and readily prepared in reproducible manner from conventional starting material. When used in catalysts for the polymerisation of olefins they provide polymers having a good balance of physical properties.

## Description
PROCESS FOR PRODUCING SPHERICAL CARRIER PARTICLES FOR OLEFIN POLYMERISATION CATALYST, CATALYST COMPRISING SUCH CARRIER PARTICLES, AND USE OF SUCH CATALYST IN OLEFIN POLYMERISATION TEis invention relates to an improved process for producing spherical catalyst carrier particles for olofin polymerization catalysts. These carrier particles can be produced from inexpensive, easily available halogen containing magnesium compounds by an easy operation with industrial advantage, and are particularly useful for preparing catalysts which are suitable for the production of olefin polymers in spherical particles having a high bulk density, a narrow particle size distribution and good flowability. In the present application, the term polymerization denotes both homopolymerization and copolymerization, and the term polymer denotes both homopolymers and copolymers. Many suggestions have.been made in the past about the use of a transition metal compound supported on a carrier in the polymerization of olefins with or without dienes or other comonomers in the presence of catalysts composed of a transition metal compound component and an organometallic compound component. The use of spherical carrier particles in the carrier supported transition metal compound is known to be contributory to the production of olefin polymers in the form of spherical particles.If the amount of olefin polymer yielded per unit weight of the csrrier supportd transition metal compound component is sufficiently high, it will bring about a great advantage in industrial operations in that de ashing of the olefin polymer can be omitted Furthermore, if the use of the carrier supported transition metal compound catalyst can lead to the formation of an olefin polymer having a high bulk density and a good particle size distribution, molding of the resulting polymer would become easy and even the customary granulation of the polymer could, in some cases, be omitted. Attempts have been made to provide olefin polymerization catalyst carriers in the form of spherical particles. For example, Japanese Laid Open PatentPublication No. 65999 74 corresponding to BritishPatent No. 1,434,543 suggests the use of particles obtained by spray granulating a molten mass of hydrated magnesium halide or an alcohol solution of magnesium halide as a carrier for olefin polymerization catalysts.Olefin polymer particles produced in the presence of a catalyst having the carrier particles prepared by the suggested method do not show satisfactory resistance to disintegration and tend to be disintegrated into a fine powder or irregularly shaped particles during operation or handling after the polymerization operation, for example during pumping or centrifugation. Furthermore, the carrier itself has no sufficient resistance to disintegration, and makes it difficult to form satisfactory spherical polymer particles In order to overcome such difficulties,Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication No. 38590 77 corresponding to west German DOS No. 2,641,960 suggests the use of a magnesium halide hydrate prepared by a special method as a startingmaterial for the carrier.This technique, however, has the disadvantage that the the starting magnesium halide hydrate must be prepared by the special method which is complicated and difficult to carry out, and therefore the reproducibility of the quality of the resultinffl carrier is not ood. The present inventors made investigations in order to provide a carrier which is free from the defec ts and disadvantages of prior techniques of providing spherical catalyst carrier particles for olefin polymerization. Phase investigations have led to the discovery that spherical carrier particles for olefin polymerization catalysts having satisfactory resistance to disintegration can be prepared commercially from easily available halo en containing magnesium compounds by an easy and inexpensive means and with good reproducibility of quality. Specifically, it has been found that a carrier having a superior spherical shape and satisfactory resistance to dicintegration can be easily produced with good reproducibility from 2 conventional halogen containing meFnesiumi compound readily available on the market by quenching a suspension of particles in the molten state of an adduct cf halogen containing magnesium compound and an active hydrogen containing oranic compound in an organic liquid medium and at least one auxiliary component selected from the group consisting of surfactants and siloxanes, thereby to solidify the adduct particles. It has also been found that a catalyst prepared by supporting a transition metal compound on the spherical carrier particles so obtained and combining it with an orvar.ometallic compound of a metal of GroupsI to III of the Mendelejeff s periodic table exhibits high activity in the polymerization of olefins, and can afford with good reproducibility an olefin polymer in spherical shape which has a high bulk density, a narrow particle size distribution, good resistance to disin tegration and good flowability. It is an object of this invention to provide a process for producing spherical catalyst particles for olefin polymerization catalysts, which can achieve the aforesaid improvements. The above and other objects and advantages of this invention will become more apparent from the following description. Phe carrier in accordance with this invention is derived from an adduct composed of a halogen containing magnesium compound and an active hydrogen containing organic compound. The halogen containing magnesium compound forming the above adduct may be a complex which further contains other metals such as aluminum, tin, silicon or germanium. The adduct may be synthesized by any method, and it may be a mixture of two or more adducts. Examples of the halogen containing magnesium compound include magnesium halides, preferably magnesium dihalides, or their complexes products obtained by halogenating organic magnesium compounds, organic magnesium aluminum complexes, the reaction products of these with organic silicon compounds such as siloxane, silanol or alkoxysilane compounds, or organic acid salts, alkoxides, aryloxides or acetylacetonates of magnesium, with halogenating agents, for example halogens such as chlorine, hydrogen halides such as hydrogen chloride, l C13, EGC13, BC13, Soy12, SiC14, AlCl3, aluminum alkyl monohalides, aluminum alkyl dihalides, alkoxy aluminum halides or benzoyl chloride products obtained by mixing and milling the aforesaid halogenation products and the aforesaid magnesium compounds the reaction products of magnesium, alcohol and halogenating agents such as hydrogen halides or halogen containing silicon compounds and decomposition products of Grignard reagents. Among these halogen containing magnesium compounds preferred are magnesium dihalides and the complexes thereof, for example magnesium chloride, magnesium bromide, magnesium iodide, and the complexes of these. The active hydrogen containing organic compound forming the adduct includes for example, alcohols, phenols, organic carboxylic acids, and gamines The alcohols are preferred. Specific examples of the active hydrogen containing organic compound are alcohols having 1 to 18 carbon atoms such as methanol, ethanol, n propanol, isopropanol, n butanol, isobutanol, sec butanol, tert butanol, n pentanol, n hexanol, n octanol, 2 ethylhexanol, n decanol, n dodecanol, n hexadecyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol and oleyl alcohol phenols having 6 to 15 carbon atoms such as phenol, cresol, xylenol, ethylphenol, isopropylphenol, ptert butylphenol, n octylphenol, n nonylphenol, cumyl phenol and naphthol carboxylic acids having 1 to 18 carbon atoms such as formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, caproic acid, caprylic acid, lauric acid, stearic acid and olefic acid and gamines having 1 to 16 carbon atoms such as methyl amine, ethylaruine, di ethylamine, n propylamine, n hexylamine, laurylamine, cyclohexylamine, aniline, benzylamine, and ethanolamine. These active hydrogencontaining compounds may be used in combination of two or more. When the halogen containing magnesium compound is a magnesium dihalide MgX2 X is halogen which is a preferred species in this invention as described hereinabove, the resulting adduct can be expressed by the formula IsigX2oYn in which Y is the active hydrogen containing compound and n is a number of from 1 to 10. As the hydrogen containing compound in this case, an alcohol is especially preferred because it can give adducts which have a relatively low melting point and therefore can be easily formed into adduct particles in the molten state suspended in an organic liquid medium A , and which when a transition metal compound is supported on it, can easily afford a catalyst of high performance. The adduct is suspended in the molten state in the organic liquid medium A . Accordingly, the organic liquid medium A should not have such a high level of affinity for the adduct that a suspension of the adduct particles in the molten state cannot be formed. As the organic liquid medium A , hydrocarbons such as hexane, heptane, octane, decane, kerosene, cyclohexane, benzene, toluene, xylene, cumene, cymene, diisopropylbenzene, tetralin, decalin and dimethylnaphthaline are especially suitable. Other solvents such as halogenated hydrocarbons and ethers can also be used. These organic media may be used singly or in combination with each other. In preparing the suspension of the adduct in the molten state in the organic liquid medium A , at least one auxiliary component selected from the group consisting of surface active agents exclusive of siloxanes and siloxanes is caused to be present together in the medium. Oil soluble surfactants are suitable in this invention, and those having an HLB of less than about 6 are preferred. The surfactants may be any of anionic, cationic and amphoteric surfactants. Specific examples of the surfactants include polyoxyalkylene glycols having a C2G3 alkylene group such as polyoxypropylene glycol and polyoxyethylenepoly oxypropylene glycol polyoxyalkylene C8 C18 alkyl ethers having a C2 C3 alkylene group such as polyoxyethylene stearyl ether, polyoxyethylene cetyl ether, polyoxyethylene myristyl ether, polyoxyethylene oleyl ether and polyoxyethylenepolyoxypropylene lauryl ether polyoxyalkylene C12 C22 aryl ethers having a C2 alkylene group such as poly.oxyethylene nonyl phenol ether, poly oxyethylenepolyoxypropylene octyl phenol ether and polyoxyethylene styrenated phenol Polyoxyalkylene acyl esters having an acyl group derived from a G8 C24 carboxylic acid and a C2 C3 alkylene group, such as polyoxyethylene monolaurate, polyoxyethylene dilaurate, polyoxyethylene stearate, polyoxyethylene oleate, polyoxyethylene sorbitan monoleate, polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate and polyoxyethylene castor oil esters of C12 Cle fatty acids with C2 C12 polyhydric alcohols, such as ethylene glycol fatty acid esters, diethylene glycol fatty acid esters, propylene glycol fatty acid esters, lycerin fatty acid esters, sorbitan fatty acid esters and sucrose fatty acid esters polyoxyethylene alkylamides polyoxyethylene alkylamines fatty acid Nalkanolamides having a C2 C3 alkanol group quaternary ammonium salts betaine polyether phosphate and polyether sulfate. More specific examples of the surfactants are sorbitan trioleate HLB 1.8 , sorbitan tristearate HLB 2.1 , propylene glycol monostearate HLB 3.4 , sorbitan sesquioleate HLB 3.7 , sorbitan monoleate HLB 4.3 , sorbitan distearate HIB 4.4 , propylene glycol monolaurate HLB 4.5 , sorbitan monostearate HtB 4.7 , diethylene glycol monostearate HLB 4.7 , diethylene glycol monolaurate HLB 6.1 , sorbitan monopalmitate HLB 6.7 , and sorbitan monolaurate HLB 8.6 .These surfactants may be used in combination of two or more. The amount of the surfactant is the one sufficient for the adduct of the halogen containing magnesium compound and the active hydrogen containing compound to be suspended in the molten state in the organic medium A . For example, the suitable concentration of the surfactant in the organic liquid medium A is about 001 to about 30 g liter, especially about 0.5 to about 20 g liter. The concentration of the adduct in the organic liquid medium A is, for example, about 0.05 to about 2 moles liter, preferably about 0.1 to about 1 mole liter. xales of the siloxanes as the auxiliary component are listed below. 1 Linear polysiloxanes of the general formulaQ QSiO nSiO3 which Q represents hydrogen, a hydroxyl group, an alkyl group having, for example, 1 to 4 carbon an an aryl group having, for example 6 to 8 carbon atoms, a cycloalkyl group having, for example, 3 to 8 carbon atoms, an alkoxy group hexing, for example, 1 to 12 carbon atoms, or a phenoxy group, and the Q groups may be identical or different with the proviso that not all of Q groups are hydrogens and n represents an integer of, for example, from 1 to 1000. Specific examples of the linear poly siloxanes are dimethylsiloxane, methylphenylsiloxane,methylhydrogemsiloxane, hexamethyldisiloxane. decamethyltetrasiloxane, tetracosamethylundecasiloxane, 3hydroheptamethyltrisiloxane, 3,5 dihydrooctamethyltetrasiloxane, 3,5,7 trihydrononamethylpentasiloxane, tetramethyl 1,3 diphenyldisiloxane,pentamethyl 1,3,5 triphenyltrisiloxane, heptaphenyldisiloxane, and octaphenyltrisiloxane. 2 Cyclopclysiloxanes of the general formula Q 2SiO p in which , represents hydrogen, an alkyl group having, for example, 1 to 4 carbon atoms, a cycloalkyl group having for example, 3 to 8 carbon atoms, an aryl group having, for example 6 to 8 carbon atoms, an alkoxy group having, for example, 1 to 12 carbon atoms, or a phenoxy group, the Q groups may be identical or different with the proviso that no all of theQ groups are hydrogens, and 2 usually represents an integer of 1 to 10. Specific examples of the cyclopolysiloxanes are 2,4,6 trimethylcyclotrisiloxane, 2,4,6,8 tetramethyl cyclotetrasiloxane, hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane, octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane, decamethylcyclopentasiloxane, dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane, triphenyl 1,3,5 tri methylcyclotrisiloxane, hexaphenylcyclotrisiloxane, and octaphenylcyclot etrasiloxane. 3 Various modified siloxanes, for example acidmodified siloxancs such as HOOCC2H4Si CH3 20 CH3 2Si C2H4COOH, CH3 SiOSi CH3 2CH2COOH, and CH3 3SiO 2Si CH3 CH2 3OSO3H amine modified siloxanes such as CH3 3SiO 3Si CH2 3NH CH2 2NH2 oxyalkylene modified siloxanes such asEMI9.1 In the above exemplification, , m, q and x, for example, represent the following numbers. 1 xX 500, 04 Z 500, 0 m 500, 1 q 500. Two or more siloxanes may be used together if they are compatible with each other. The amount of the siloxane is about 0.1 to about o by weight, preferably 0.2 to 10 by weight, based on the weight of the organic medium. According to the process of this invention, particles of the adduct in the molten state composed of the halogen containing magnesium compound and the active hydrogen containing organic compound is suspended in the organic liquid medium A in the co presence of the auxiliary component selected from surfactants and siloxanes of the types exemplified hereinabove to form a suspension of the adduct particles in the molten state The suspension can be formed, for example, by suspending the adduct particles in the molten state in the organic liquid medium A in the co presence of at least one auxiliary component at a temperature at which the adduct melts or at a higher temperature by a known suspending means.Examples of the suspending means are a shaking method, a stirring method, a leaking method, an injection method, the Jurgen Iohman method, an ultrasonic method, a colloid mill method, a high pres sure jetting method, or combinations of these. By using these suspending means, the suspension can be formed so that the adduct particles in the suspension become spherical particles having a particle diameter of about 0.1 to about 200 microns, preferably about 1 to about 100 microns. By quenching the resulting suspension of the adduct particles in the molten state, the adduct particles are solidified and the desired spherical catalyst carrier can be formed. Any desired means of quenching can be employed unless the suspended particles coalesce with each other or deform to substantially lose the desired spherical shape. In one preferred embodiment, the suspension formed is rapidly contacted with an organic liquid medium B having a temperature low enough to solidify the adduct particles in the molten state0 In the practice of this embodiment, the suspension can be introduced into the organic liquid medium B preferably with stirring. Or conversely, the medium B may be introduced into the suspension, The organic liquid medium B needs not to be, but may be, the same as the organic liquid medium A .It may be properly selected from the compounds exemplified hereinabove as the organic liquid medium A . In the quenching step, it is preferred to maintain the temperature of the organic liquid medium B at a point at least about 1000 lower than the melting temperature of the adduct as suspended particles.If desired, the aforesaid auxiliary component may also be incorporated in the medium B . In another embodiment of quenching, a liquefied gas held at a low temperature such as liquefied carbon dioxide gas or liquefied propane may be blown into the suspension of the adduct particles in the molten state and is gasified in the suspension to quench the suspension system and solidify the adduct particles. The solidified particles of the adduct may be separated and recovered by any known solid liquid separating means such as filtration or centrifugal separation.The resulting carrier for olefin polymerization catalysT ts is hard and exhibits satisfactory resistance to disintegration in the subsequent operations and handling.It is in the form of good spherical particles having a narrow distribution of particle size. A transition metal compound catalyst component for olefin polymerization obtained by supporting a transition metal compound on the resulting carrier by any means which does not substantially involve pulverization equally has the advantage of being hard and resistant to disintegration.Of course, the resulting spherical carrier particles may be classified to obtain a narrower size distribution before it is used in supporting the transition metal compound. Various methods can be employed in supporting the transition metal compound on the carrier obtained by the process of this invention. They include, for example, a method which comprises reacting the carrier directly with the transition metal compound as inJapanese Patent Publication .o. 34092 71 corresponding to British Patent 1,271,411 a method which comprises reacting the carrier with an organometallic compound of a metal of Groups I to III of the periodic table and then reacting the product with the transition metal compound as in Japanese Patent Publication No. 32270 75 corresponding to British Patent o. 1,433,537 orJapanese Laid Open Patent Publication Ilo. 21093 78 corresponding to west German DOS iio. 2734672 a method which comprises reacting the carrier with a halogen compound or organic compound of silicon or tin and the transition metal compound consecutively or simultaneously as in Japanese Laid Open Publication No. 72383 74 and 83983 raj4 the two Publications correspond to BritishPatent No. 1,45 2,314 a method which comprises reacting the carrier with an organic acid ester and an organometallic compound of a metal of Groups I to III of the periodic table, and then reacting, the product with the transition metal compound as in Japanese Laid OpenPatent Publication No. 28189 76 corresponding toBritish Patent No. 1,502,886 a method which comprises reacting the carrier with an organic acid ester and a halogen compound or organic compound of silicon or tin, and then reacting the product with the transition metal compound as in Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication No.92885 76 correspondina to British Patent No.1,505,315 a method which comprises reacting the transition metal catalyst component obtained by any of the above cited methods further with an organometallic compound of a metal of Groups I to III and the transition metal compound, as shown in Japanese Laid Open PatentPublication No. 127185 76 and a method which comprises reacting the transition metal compound obtained in each of the aforesaid methods with an electron donor and the transition metal compound as in Japanese Laid OpenPatent Publication . 3088 77. phe transition metal compound to be supported on the catalyst carrier obtained by the process of this invention may, for example, be compounds of titanium, vanadium, chromium, etc. The titanium compounds are preferred. The supporting reaction may be performed by suspending the carrier, with or without the pre treatment exemplified, in the transition metal compound which is maintained in the liquid phase under the supporting reaction conditions, or in a solution of the transition metal compound in an inert organic solvent. The supporting reaction can be carried out at a temperature of about 0 C to about 2000C, preferably about 30 to about 1500C. Preferably, the supporting reaction is carried out in the presence of an excess of the transition metal compound, and for example, about 0.1 to about 100 moles, preferably about 1 to about W moles, of the transition metal compound is present per gram atom of magnesium in the carrier. The supporting reaction may be performed in two steps or more.Preferred transition metal compounds are those which are liquid under the supporting reaction conditions, or are soluble in o solvent that may be used in the reaction Specific examples are titanium compounds of the formula Ti OR nX4 n in whichR represents a hydrocarbon group, I represents a halogen atom, and n is a number represented by O n 4 and vanadium compounds of the formula VX4 or VC OR mX3 in which R and X are as defined, and m is a number represented by O m m 3.Examples of the group R are alkyl groups having 2 to 18 carbon atoms, cycloalkyl groups having 5 to 8 carbon atoms, an allyl group, and aryl groups having 6 to 15 carbon atoms. Examples of X are chlorine, bromine, and iodine. The titanium compounds are preferred, and titanium tetrahalides are especially preferred. Pre treatment of the carrier with an electron donor, an organometallic compound of metal Qf GroupsI to III of the periodic table, a halogen compound or organic compound of silicon or tin, etc. prior to the supporting of the transition metal compound is described in detail, for example, in the patent documents cited hereinabove, For example, the pre treatment may be carried out at about 0 to about 150 C while suspending the carrier in an inert solvent, The catalyst component obtained by supporting the transition metal compound on the carrier obtained by the process of this invention contains about 3 to about 120 mg, preferably about 5 to about 60 mg, of transition metal per gram of catalyst component.The atomic ratio of the halogen to the transition metal is at least about 4, preferably at least 8, more preferably from about 8 to about 50. The aforesaid catalyst component contains magnesium, halogen and transition metal as essential ingredients, and may optionally contain an electron donor such as an organic acid ester. The supported transition metal catalyst component so obtained, in combination with an organometallic compound of a metal of Groups I to III of the MendeleeÅaeff s periodic table, can be used in the polymerization or copolymerizatidn of olefins with or without dienes and other comonomers. Organoaluminum compounds are preferred as the organometallic compounds.Especially preferred among them are trialkyl aluminums, dialkyl aluminum halides, alkyl aluminum sesquihalides, alkyl aluminum halides, and mixtures of these. Suitable olefins used in the aforesaid polymerization are C2 C10 olefins such as ethylene, propylene, l butene, 4 methyl l pentene and 1 octene. They may be subjected not only to monopolymerization but also to random copolymerization and block copolymerization.In copolymerization, polyunsaturated compounds such as conjugated or non conugated dienes may be selected as the comonomers. For example, in the copolymerization of propylene, there may be employed a method which comprises polymerizing propylene until the amount of propylene homopolymer is about 60 to about 90 by weight based on the entire composition, and subsequently, polymerizing a propylene ethylene mixture or ethylene. Alternatively, a mixture of propylene and ethylene may be polymerized in order to obtain a copolymer containing ethylene in an amount of not more than about 10 mole . The polymerization may be carried out either in the liquid phase or in the vapor phase. In the liquid phase polymerization, an inert solvent such as hexane, heptane or kerosene may be used as a reaction medium, but the olefin itself may also be used as the reaction medium. It is preferred that in the liquid phase polymerization, the amount of the supported transition metal compound component be about 0.001 to about 1 millimole calculated as transition metal atom per liter of the liquid phase, and the amount of the organometallic compound be about 1 to about 1000 moles, preferably about 5 to about 500 moles, calculated as metal atom per mole of transition metal.When the vapor phase polymerization is carried out, a fluidized layer, a stirred fluidized layer, etc. may be employed, and the supported transition metal compound is fed into the polymerization reactor with or without dilution with a solid such as polyethylene, polypropylene, glass beads or silica, hexane, olefins, etc. while the organomotallic compound is fed into the polymorization vessel with or without dilution with hexane, olefins, etc. In some cases, hydrogen, etc. may be fed in the form of gas into the polymerization vessel. The proportions of the catalyst components are the same as in the case of the liquidphase polymerization. The olefin polymerizing temperature is generally about 20 to about 2000 C, preferably about 200C to a point below the melting point of the resulting polyolefin, especially preferably about 40 to about 120 C. The polymerization can be performed at atmospheric pressure to about 100 kg cm2.G, preferably at elevated pressure of about 2 to about 50 ky cm2 G. In the polymerization of alpha olefins, the molecular weight of the polymer can be adjusted to some extent by varying the polymerization conditions such as the polymerization temperature or the mole ratio of the catalyst ingredients. It can be effectively performed by adding hydrogen to the polymerization system, In the polymerization of alpha olefins having at least 3 carbon atoms, there may be used an electron donor such as alcohols, ethers, esters, amines, acid anhydrides, ketones, carboxylic acids, amides, phosphorus compounds and polysiloxanes in order, for example, to control stereo specificity. The electron donor may be used in the for of an adduct with the organometallic compound or a Lewis acid such as AlX3. When, for example, propylene is polymerized using the supported transition metal catalyst component on the carrier obtained by the process of this invention, the amount of the transition metal is extremely small for the amount of polypropylene formed, and the polypropylene obtained is in the form of spherical particles having a narrow particle size distribution and a high bulk density. Accordingly, this offers the advantage that the after treatinent of the polymer subsequent to the polymerization is very mch simplified, or in many cases, is not required at all.In polymerization in the absence of a solvent, great improvements are obtained in problems associated with the polymerization process, such as the uniformity of the fluidized condition, process restrictions by the formation of a fine powdery polymer, or the in process transportation of the polymer powder, and a polymer which can directly be a final product can be obtained by the solventless poly meri zation. The following examples illustrate the present invention more specifically.Example 1 I Synthesis of spherical MgCl2. nEtOH A 2 liter high speed stirrer a product ofTokushu Kika Kogyo K.
