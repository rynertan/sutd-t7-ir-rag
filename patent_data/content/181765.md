# Automobile antenna system.

## Abstract
The present invention provides an automobile antenna system for detecting surface currents induced on the vehicle body by radio waves, the antenna system including an electrostatic shielding case 10 mounted on the vehicle body and having an opening 10a formed therein faced to a metallic plate 34 in the vehicle body and a loop antenna 12 housed within the electrostatic shielding case and disposed in close proximity to the opening thereof, the loop antenna having a plane of loop positioned relative to the surface of the metallic vehicle plate with an angle in the range of 90 degrees to 135 degrees or 225 degrees to 270 degrees, whereby the antenna system can more efficiently detect the surface currents induced on the vehicle body by radio waves and can be miniaturized and improved in performance without any externally protruding member as in the prior art.
