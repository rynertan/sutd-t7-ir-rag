# Corrosion Resistant, Multiple Wall Pipe Structure and Method.

## Abstract
In a corrosion resistant, double wall pipe structure formed by tightly fitting a stainless steel inner pipe 3 in an outer pipe 2 , the inner pipe 3 at any portion thereof which is liable to be adversely affected by heat due to heat processing is replaced by an inner tube 8 of a special metal having corrosion resistance which is not easily impaired by the heat, the inner tube 8 being joined integrally to the remainder portion of the stainless steel inner pipe 3 .
