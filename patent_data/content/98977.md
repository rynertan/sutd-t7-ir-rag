# Catalyst system containing an anionic initiator and a phosphine oxide modifier and process for production of polymers having increased 1,2 microstructure.

## Abstract
A process and catalyst system is disclosed herein for the preparation of co polymers having a 1,2 microstructure of between about 20 and about 65 percent. These co polymers are prepared in a hydrocarbon or non polar solvent from a monomer system which contains at least one 1,3 diene monomer. The catalyst system which is employed in the production of the co polymer is a combination of an anionic initiator based on lithium and a phosphine oxide modifier which is substituted with three saturated heterocyclic rings, each hetero ring containing one nitrogen atom and either four, five or six carbon atoms.
