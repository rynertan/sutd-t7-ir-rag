# Explosive compositions.

## Abstract
A slurry explosive composition comprising at least one inorganic oxygen supplying salt, a solvent or carrier for said salt, a solid or liquid fuel or fuel sensitiser and, as thickener, a sulfonated guar gum derivative, said thickener being effective to improve the high temperature storage, water resistance and pumpability of the explosive, and to inhibit segregation of the ingredients. The thickener is especially beneficial in slurries containing calcium nitrate.
