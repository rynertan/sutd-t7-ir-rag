# Pneumatic control system.

## Abstract
A pneumatic control assembly comprising a plurality of control valve printed circuit board pneumatic connectors 13 disposed in a card cage 10 in communication with a like number of control logic manifolds 17 fixed to the card cage. The control logic manifolds are programmed to provide the actual control functions to the associated apparatus thereby permitting the control valve printed circuit board pneumatic connectors to be identical.
