# SOLID ADSORBENT FOR UNSATURATED HYDROCARBON AND PROCESS FOR SEPARATION OF UNSATURATED HYDROCARBON FROM GAS MIXTURE

## Abstract
A solid adsorbent for an unsaturated hydrocarbon com prising a i a silver or copper I halide or ii a silver or copper I halide and the halide of a bivalent metal, or iii a silver or copper I halide and an aluminum halide, and b polystyrene or a derivative thereof. This solid adsorbent can effectively adsorb an unsaturated hydrocarbon such as ethylene from a gas mixture by contact ing the gas mixture therewith at a temperature of 40 C to 140 C under normal pressures.
