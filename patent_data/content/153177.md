## Description
Mineral oils containing paraffin wax have the characteristic of becoming less fluid as the temperature of the oil decreases. This loss of fluidity is due to the crystallization of the wax into plate like crystals which eventually form a spongy mass entrapping the oil therein. It has long been known that various additives act as wax crystal modifiers when blended with waxy mineral oils. These compositions modify the size and shape of wax crystals and reduce the adhesive forces between the crystals and between the wax and the oil in such a manner as to permit the oil to remain fluid at a lower temperature. Various pour point depressants have been described in the literature and several of these are in commercial use. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 3,048,479 teaches the use of copolymers of ethylene and C₃ C₅ vinyl esters, e.g. vinyl acetate, as pour depressants for fuels, specifically heating oils, diesel and jet fuels. Hydrocarbon polymeric pour depressants based on ethylene and higher alpha olefins, e.g. propylene, are also known. U.S. Patent 3,961,916 teaches the use of a mixture of copolymers, one of which is a wax crystal nucleator and the other a growth arrestor to control the size of the wax crystals. United Kingdom Patent 1263152 suggests that the size of the wax crystals may be controlled by using a copolymer having a lower degree of side chain branching. It has also been proposed in for example United Kingdom Patent 1469016 that the copolymers of di n alkyl fumarates and vinyl acetate which have previously been used as pour depressants for lubricating oils may be used as co additives with ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers in the treatment of distillate fuels with high final boiling points to improve their low temperature flow properties. According to United Kingdom Patent 1469016 these polymers may be C₆ to C₁₈ alkyl esters of unsaturated C₄ to C₈ dicarboxylic acids particularly lauryl fumarate and lauryl hexadecyl fumarate. Typically the materials used are mixed esters with an average of about 12 carbon atoms Polymer A . It is notable that the additives are shown not to be effective in the conventional fuels of lower Final Boiling Point Fuels III and IV . With the increasing diversity in distillate fuels, types of fuel have emerged which cannot be treated by the existing additives or which require an uneconomically high level of additive to achieve the necessary reduction in their pour point and control of wax crystal size for low temperature filterability to allow them to be used commercially. One particular group of fuels that present such problems are those which have a relatively narrow, and or low boiling range. Fuels are frequently characterised by their Initial Boiling Point, Final Boiling Point and the interim temperatures at which certain volume percentages of the initial fuel have been distilled. Fuels whose 20 to 90 distillation point differ within the range of from 70 to 100 C and or whose 90 boiling temperature is from 10 to 25 C of the final boiling point and or whose final boiling points are between 340 and 370 C have been found particularly difficult to treat sometimes being virtually unaffected by additives or otherwise requiring very high levels of additive. All distillations referred to herein are according to ASTM D86. With the increase in the cost of crude oil, it has also become important for a refiner to increase his production of distillate fuels and to optimise his operations using what is known as sharp fractionation again resulting in distillate fuels that are difficult to treat with conventional additives or that require a treat level that is unacceptably high from the economic standpoint. Typical sharply fractionated fuels also have a 90 to final boiling point range of 10 to 25 C usually with a 20 to 90 boiling range of less than 100 C, generally 50 to 100 C. Both types of fuel have final boiling points above 340 C generally a final boiling point in the range 340 C to 370 C especially 340 C to 365 C. In addition there is at times a need to lower what is known as the cloud point of distillate fuels the cloud point being the temperature at which the wax begins to crystallise out from the fuel as it cools. This need is applicable to both the difficult to treat fuels described above and the entire range of distillate fuels which typically boil in the range 120 C to 500 C. The copolymers of ethylene and vinyl acetate which have found widespread use for improving the flow of the previously widely available distillate fuels have not been found to be effective in the treatment of the narrow boiling and or sharply fractionated fuels described above. Furthermore use of mixtures as illustrated in United Kingdom Patent 1469016 have not been found effective. We have found however that combinations of copolymers containing very specific alkyl groups, such as specific di n alkyl fumarate vinyl acetate copolymers and other low temperature flow improvers, are effective in both lowering the pour point of the difficult to treat fuels described above and controlling the size of the wax crystals to allow filterability including those of the lower final boiling point in which the additives of United Kingdom Patent 1469016 were ineffective. We have also found that the copolymers are effective in lowering the cloud point of many fuels over the entire range of distillate fuels. Specifically we have found that if the average number of carbon atoms in the alkyl groups in the copolymer is from 12 to 14 and it contains no more than 10 wt of comonomer in which the alkyl groups contains more than 14 carbon atoms and preferably no more than 20 wt of comonomer in which the alkyl group contains fewer than 12 carbon atoms, the copolymers are particularly effective when used in combination with other low temperature flow improvers which on their own are ineffective in these types of fuels. In our European Patent Publication 0153176 we describe the use for improving the low temperature properties of a distillate petroleum fuel oil boiling in the range 120 C to 500 C, whose 90 to final boiling point range is 10 to 25 C of a specific type of polymer or copolymer within this broader group of copolymers. These specific polymers and copolymers are of a di n alkyl ester of a mono ethylenically unsaturated C₄ to C₈ dicarboxylic acid containing at least 25 wt of n alkyl groups wherein the average number of carbon atoms in the n alkyl groups is from above 12 to 14 and no more than 10 wt of alkyl groups in the copolymer containing more than 14 carbon atoms. The present invention now provides the use for improving the flow properties of a distillate petroleum fuel oil boiling in the range 120 C to 500 C, an additive combination comprising i a copolymer containing at least 25 wt of a n alkyl ester of a mono ethylenically unsaturated C₄ to C₈ mono or dicarboxylic acid, the average number of carbon atoms in the n alkyl groups is from 12 to 14 said, said n alkyl ester containing no more than 10 wt. of comonomer containing alkyl groups containing more than 14 carbon atoms where R¹ is hydrogen or a C₁ to C₄ alkyl group, R is COOR or OOCR where R is a C₁ to C₅ alkyl group and R is R or hydrogen or an olefin, and preferably no more than 20 wt of comonomer in which the alkyl group contains fewer than 12 carbon atoms and ii another low temperature flow improver for distillate fuels. The additive combinations are preferably used in an amount from 0.0001 to 0.5 wt , based on the weight of the distillation petroleum fuel oil, and the present invention also includes such treated distillate fuel. The copolymer may be of a di n alkyl ester of a dicarboxylic acid containing the C₁₂ C₁₄ alkyl groups and may also contain from 25 to 70 wt. of a vinyl ester, an alkyl acrylate, methacrylate or alpha olefine. The polymers used in the present invention preferably have a number average molecular weight in the range of 1000 to 100,000, preferably 1,000 to 30,000 as measured, for example, by Vapor Pressure Osmometry. The dicarboxylic acid esters useful for preparing the polymer can be represented by the general formula Wherein R₁ and R₂ are hydrogen or a C₁ to C₄ alkyl group, e.g., methyl, R₃ is the C₁₂ to C₁₄ average, straight chain alkyl group, and R₄ is COOR₃, hydrogen or a C₁ to C₄ alkyl group preferably COOR₃. These may be prepared by esterifying the particular mono or di carboxylic acid with the appropriate alcohol or mixture of alcohols. Examples of other C₁₂ C₁₄ unsaturated esters, are the C₁₂ C₁₄ alkyl acrylates and methacrylates. The dicarboxylic acid mono or di ester monomers may be copolymerized with various amounts, e.g, 5 to 70 mole , of other unsaturated esters or olefins. Such other esters include short chain alkyl esters having the formula where R is hydrogen or a C₁ to C₄ alkyl group, R 1 is COOR or OOCR where R is a C₁ to C₅ alkyl group branched or unbranched, and R is R or hydrogen. Examples of these short chain esters are methacrylates, acrylates, fumarates and maleates, the vinyl esters such as vinyl acetate and vinyl propionate being preferred. More specific examples include methyl methacrylate, isopropenyl acetate and butyl and isobutyl acrylate. Our preferred copolymers contain from 40 to 60 mole of a C₁₂ C₁₄ average dialkyl fumarate and 60 to 40 mole of vinyl acetate. The preferred ester polymers are generally prepared by polymerising the ester monomers in a solution of a hydrocarbon solvent such as heptane, benzene, cyclohexane, or white oil, at a temperature generally in the range of from 20 C to 150 C and usually promoted with a peroxide or azo type catalyst, such as benzoyl peroxide or azodiisobutyronitrile, under a blanket of an inert gas such as nitrogen or carbon dioxide, in order to exclude oxygen. The additive combinations of the present invention are particularly effective when the other low temperature flow improver is the polyoxyalkylene esters, ethers, ester ethers and mixtures thereof, particularly those containing at least one preferably at least two C₁₀ to C₃₀ linear saturated alkyl groups and a polyoxyalkylene glycol group of molecular weight 100 to 5,000 preferably 200 to 5,000, the alkyl group in said polyoxyalkylene glycol containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms. These materials form the subject of European Patent Publication 0061895 A2. The preferred esters, ethers or ester ethers useful in the present invention may be structurally depicted by the formula the alkyl group being linear and saturated and containing 10 to 30 carbon atoms, and A represents the polyoxyalkylene segment of the glycol in which the alkylene group has 1 to 4 carbon atoms, such as a polyoxymethylene, polyoxyethylene or polyoxytrimethylene moiety which is substantially linear some degree of branching with lower alkyl side chains such as in polyoxypropylene glycol may be tolerated it is preferred that the glycol should be substantially linear. Suitable glycols generally are the substantially linear polyethylene glycols PEG and polypropylene glycols PPG having a molecular weight of about 100 to 5,000 preferably about 200 to 2,000. Esters are preferred and fatty acids containing from 10 30 carbon atoms are useful for reacting with the glycols to form the ester additives and it is preferred to use a C₁₈ C₂₄ fatty acid, especially behenic acids, the esters may also be prepared by esterifying polyethoxylated fatty acids or polyethoxylated alcohols. Polyoxyalkylene diesters, diethers, ether esters and mixtures thereof are suitable as additives with diesters preferred for use in narrow boiling distillates whilst minor amounts of monoethers and monoesters may also be present and are often formed in the manufacturing process it is important for additive performance that a major amount of the dialkyl compound is present. In particular stearic or behenic diesters of polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol or polyethylene polypropylene glycol mixtures are preferred. The other low temperature flow improver may also be the ethylene unsaturated ester copolymer flow improvers. The unsaturated monomers which may be copolymerized with ethylene, include unsaturated motto and diesters of the general formula wherein R₆ is hydrogen or methyl a R₅ is a OOCR₈ group wherein R₈ is hydrogen or a C₁ to C₂₈, more usually C₁ to C₁₇, and preferably a C₁ to C₈, straight or branched chain alkyl group or R₅ is a COOR₈ group wherein R₈ is as previously described but is not hydrogen and R₇ is hydrogen or COOR₈ as previously defined. The monomer, when R₅ and R₇ are hydrogen and R₅ is OOCR₈, includes vinyl alcohol esters of C₁ to C₂₉, more usually C₁ to C₁₈, monocarboxylic acid, and preferably C₂ to C₅₄ monocarboxylic acid. Examples of vinyl esters which may be copolymerised with ethylene include vinyl acetate, vinyl propionate and vinyl butyrate and isobutyrate, vinyl acetate being preferred. We prefer that the copolymers contain from 20 to 40 wt. of the vinyl ester more preferably from 25 to 35 wt. vinyl ester. They may also be mixtures of two copolymers such as those described in United States Patent 3961916. It is preferred that these copolymers have a number average molecular weight as measured by vapor phase osmometry of 1000 to 6000, preferably 1000 to 3000. Another example of other low temperature flow improvers are the polar compounds, either ionic or nonionic, which have the capability in fuels of acting as wax crystal growth inhibitors. Polar nitrogen containing compounds have been found to be especially effective when used in combination with the glycol esters, ethers or ester ethers and such three component mixtures are within the scope of the present invention. These polar compounds are preferably amine salts and or amides formed by reaction of at least one molar proportion of hydrocarbyl substituted amines with a molar proportion of hydrocarbyl acid having 1 4 carboxylic acid groups or their anhydrides ester amides may also be used generally they contain a total of 30 to 300 carbon atoms preferably 50 to 150 carbon atoms. These nitrogen compounds are described in U.S. Patent 4,211,534. Suitable amines are usually long chain C₁₂ C₄₀ primary, secondary, tertiary or quarternary amines or mixtures thereof but shorter chain amines may be used provided the resulting nitrogen compound is oil soluble and therefore normally containing about 30 to 300 total carbon atoms. The nitrogen compound preferably contains at least one straight chain C₈ C₄₀ preferably C₁₄ C₂₄alkyl segment. Suitable amines include primary, secondary, tertiary or quaternary, but preferably are secondary. Tertiary and quarternary amines can only form amine salts. Examples of amines include tetradecyl amine, cocoamine, hydrogenated tallow amine and the like. Examples of secondary amines include dioctadecyl amine, methyl behenyl amine and the like. Amine mixtures are also suitable and many amines derived from natural materials are mixtures. The preferred amine is a secondary hydrogenated tallow amine of the formula HNR₁R₂ wherein R₁ and R₂ are alkyl groups derived from hydrogenated tallow fat composed of approximately 4 C₁₄, 31 C₁₆, 59 C₁₈. Examples of suitable carboxylic acids for preparing these nitrogen compounds and their anhydrides include cyclo hexane dicarboxylic acid, cyclohexene dicarboxylic acid, cyclopentane dicarboxylic acid, dialpha naphthyl acetic acid, naphthalene dicarboxylic acid and the like. Generally these acids will have about 5 13 carbon atoms in the cyclic moiety. Preferred acids useful in the present invention are benzene dicarboxylic acids such as ortho phthalic acid, para phthalic acid, and meta phthalic acid. Ortho phthalic acid or its anhydride is particularly preferred. The particularly preferred amine compound is that amide amine salt formed by reacting 1 molar portion of phthalic anhydride with 2 molar portions of di hydrogenated tallow amine. Another preferred compound is the diamide formed by dehydrating this amide amine salt. It is preferred that the relative proportions of additives used in the additive combinations of the present invention are from 0.5 to 20 parts by weight of the polymer of the invention containing the n alkyl groups containing an average of 12 to 14 carbon atoms to 1 part of the polyoxyalkylene esters, ether or ester ether, more preferably from 1.5 to 9 parts by weight of the polymer of the invention. The additive combinations of the present invention may be used in any type of distillate petroleum oil boiling in the range 120 C to 500 C but it is particularly useful for improving the low temperature filtration of fuels whose 20 and 90 distillation points differ by less than 100 C and or for improving the flow properties of a distillate fuel whose 90 to final boiling point range is 10 to 25 C and or whose final boiling point is in the range 340 C to 370 C. The additive combinations of the present invention may conveniently be supplied as concentrates for incorporation into the bulk distillate fuel. These concentrates may also contain other additives as required. These concentrates preferably contain from 3 to 75 wt. , more preferably 3 to 60 wt. , most preferably 10 to 50 wt. of the additives preferably in solution in oil. Such concentrates are also within the scope of the present invention. The present invention is illustrated by the following Examples in which the effectiveness of the additives of the present invention as pour point depressants and filterability improvers were compared with other similar additives in the following tests. By one method, the response of the oil to the additives was measured by the Cold Filter Plugging Point Test CFPP which is carried out by the procedure described in detail in Journal of the Institute of Petroleum , Volume 52, Number 510, June 1966, pp. 173 185. This test is designed to correlate with the cold flow of a middle distillate in automotive diesels. In brief, a 40 ml sample of the oil to be tested is cooled in a bath which is maintained at about 34 C to give non linear cooling at about 1 C min. Periodically at each one degree Centrigrade drop in temperature starting from at least 2 C above the cloud point the cooled oil is tested for its ability to flow through a fine screen in a prescribed time period using a test device which is a pipette to whose lower end is attached an inverted funnel which is positioned below the surface of the oil to be tested. Stretched across the mouth of the funnel is a 350 mesh screen having an area defined by a 12 millimetre diameter. The periodic tests are each initiated by applying a vacuum to the upper end of the pipette whereby oil is drawn through the screen up into the pipette to a mark indicating 20 ml of oil. After each successful passage the oil is returned immediately to the CFPP tube. The test is repeated with each one degree drop in temperature until the oil fails to fill the pipette within 60 seconds. This temperature is reported as the CFPP temperature. The difference between the CFPP of an additive free fuel and of the same fuel containing additive is reported as the CFPP depression by the additive. A more effective flow improver gives a greater CFPP depression at the same concentration of additive. Another determination of flow improver effectiveness is made under conditions of the flow improver distillate operability test DOT test which is a slow cooling test designed to correlate with the pumping of a stored heating oil. In this test the cold flow properties of the fuels were determined by the DOT test as follows. 300 ml of fuel are cooled linearly at 1 C hour to the test temperature and the temperature then held constant. After 2 hours at the test temperature, approximately 20 ml of the surface layer is removed as the abnormally large wax crystals which tend to form on the oil air interface during cooling. Wax which has settled in the bottle is dispersed by gentle stirring, then a CFPP filter assembly is inserted. The tap is opened to apply a vacuum of 500 mm of mercury, and closed when 200 ml of fuel have passed through the filter into the graduated receiver. A PASS is recorded if the 200 ml are collected within ten seconds through a given mesh size or a FAIL if the flow rate is too slow indicating that the filter has become blocked. CFPP filter assemblies with filter screens of 20, 30, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 150, 200, 250 and 350 mesh number are used to determine the finest mesh largest mesh number the fuel will pass. The larger the mesh number that a wax containing fuel will pass, the smaller are the wax crystals and the greater the effectiveness of the additive flow improver. It should be noted that no two fuels will give exactly the same test results at the same treatment level for the same flow improver additive. The Pour Point was determined by two methods, either the ASTM D 97 or a visual method in which 100 ml samples of fuel in a 150 ml narrow necked bottle containing the additive under test, are cooled at 1 C hour from 5 C above the wax appearance temperature. The fuel samples were examined at 3 C intervals for their ability to pour when tilted or inverted. A fluid sample designated F would move readily on tilting, a semi fluid designated semi F sample may need to be almost inverted, while a solid sample designated S can be inverted with no movement of the sample. The fuels used in these Examples were The Additives used were as follows The results were as follows, those containing a single additive being for purposes of comparison The additives of the invention were compared in the DOT test with Additive 3 which was an oil solution containing 63 wt. of a combination of polymers comprising 13 parts by weight of an ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer of number average molecular weight 2500 and vinyl acetate content of 36 wt. and 1 part by weight of a copolymer of ethylene and vinyl acetate of number average molecular weight 3500 and a vinyl acetate content of about 13 wt. . Various fumarate vinyl acetate copolymers were tested in admixture 3 parts with Additive 1 2 parts to determine the effect of the chain length in the fumarate with the following results. Various fumarate vinyl acetate copolymers obtained from 25 different alcohols but averaging 12 to 13.5 carbon atoms in the alkyl groups were tested in the same mixture as in the previous example in the CFPP and Visual Pour Point tests with the following results. The fuels B and C were used in the following Examples together with The results are shown in the following table. Where the additive has no pour depressing effect, the CFPP value is not measured because without pour depression the fuel cannot be used. The Additives were also tested in combination with Additive 4 the half amide formed by reacting two moles of hydrogenated tallow amine with phthalic anhydride and the CFPP depressions in Fuel B were as follows The effectiveness of the Additives of the present invention in lowering the cloud point of distillate fuels was determined by the standard Cloud Point Test IP 219 or ASTM D 2500 and estimated by different scanning calorimitry using a Mettler TA 2000B differential scanning calorimeter. In the test a 25 microlitre sample of the fuel is cooled from a temperature at least 10 C above the expected cloud point at a cooling rate of 2 C per minute and the cloud point of the fuel is estimated as the wax appearance temperature as indicated by the differential scanning calorimeter plus 6 C.
