## Description
IMPROVED UNDER LOAD DIVIDING SWITCH It is known that the switches commonly called dividing switches under load , intended for opening and closing electric circuit connected to electric loads, have a number of requirements which can even be mutually conflicting. More particularly, these switches can be installed within cupboards, in which a partition wall is provided which forms in the cupboard two compartments, to the first of which arrive the current feeding conductors, generally bus bars, whereas in the second compartment the under load dividing switches are mounted. It is specified by the safety standards that an operator be not allowed to have in its reach, even accidentally, the live conductors of the first compartment from the second of said compartments. Inasmuch as those conductors are electrically connected to the fixed contact of the dividing switch, in order to prevent the fixed contact from being a live element in the second compartment even when the dividing switch is open,it has often been suggested to insert between the bus bars and the dividing switch another dividing switch, adapted to cut the connection between the bus bars and the main dividing switch under load before that the second compartment is opened. It is apparent that this expedient involves a supplementary expense, on considering that every underload dividing switch must be equipped with its no load auxiliary dividing switch. This invention thus is proposing a solution of this problem, that is, a dividing switch structure which is adapted to provide the segregation of the live parts in the open position of the dividing switch without requiring any auxiliary no load dividing switch, In addition, an object of the invention is to provide such an under load dividing switch which can be installed with considerable ease both on a switchboard and on a wall without anyhow tampering with the complete assembly of the apparatus and all the component parts thereof as it comes from the workshop. This fact may ensure, as it is apparent, that the electrical and mechanical features of the dividing switch are in no wise altered during progress of the installation. In order that these objects, together with others to be more detailedly dealt with hereinafter, the invention proposes to provide and under load dividing switch comprising a frame on which a fixed contact is supported together with a column in which a contact is slidable which can be shifted from a closed position wherein it engages a fixed contact, and an open position in which the movable contact is withdrawn from the fixed contact, said under load dividing switch being characterized in that said fixed contact is mounted in the interior and on the base of an insulating cup supported by said frame. In order that the essential advantages and features of a dividing switch made according to this invention may be better understood, an exemplary embodiment thereof will be described hereinafter, the description being aided by the accompanying drawings, wherein FIGURE 1 is a perspective view of a few switches according to this invention, FIGURE 2 is a side elevational view, partly in cross section, of an individual switch, FIGURE 3 is an alternative embodiment of the switch of FIGURE 2, and FIGURE 4 is a showing of a number of switches according to FIGURE 2 assembled within a cup board. One or more dividing switches, generally indicated at 10, are mounted on a frame indicated at 11, for example of sheet metal, as shown in FIGURE 1. Each dividing switch, as best shown in FIG. 2 provides for fastening to the frame 11 a column 12 by means of an insulating arm 13. Within the column 12 is slidably mounted the member 14 which is the movable contact of the dividing switch and is driven by the connecting rod 15 telescopably connected to the shaft 16. A compression spring which overtakes the dead centre stably holds the movable contact 14 in the position of open switch as shown in the drawing or in the closed switch position, respectively, when the contact 14 is thrust against the fixed contact 18 mounted in the interior of the cup 19 made of an insulating material and fastened to the frame 11. A characteristic and essential component part of the dividing switch according to this invention is the structure connected to the fixed contact more particularly, it is essential that the fixed contact be borne by the dielectric cup 19, which provides in its interior a recess which can be closed by a two section shutter, composed by two sections, 20 and 21, which are mutually interlinked. The portion 20 carries two lateral projections 22 which slide into guideways 23 of the rectangular base of the cup 19 and the portion 21 is linked at 24 to the frame. A clevis 25 engages in a rack and pinion connection way at 26 with the shaft 24 and likewise at 27 engages the shaft 28 of the earthing contact 29. It is thus obvious that the closure of the earthing contact 29j that is the position taken by the shutter as depicted in FIGURE 2 in solid lines, causes the interior of the cup 19 to become completely closed so that the fixed contact 18 is inaccessible, according to the object of the invention. The movable contact 14, as well as the earthing contact 29 and their component and ancillary parts are well known and may take any of the conventional configurations as adopted in the art for this reason, no de tailed description thereof will be given. The insertion of the dielectric cup between the fixed contact and the frame permits that a satisfactory esclusion of the live members be obtained when mounting the switch in cupboard assemblies, such as depicted more detailedly in FIGURE 4. The requested number of dividing switches according to the invention can be mounted on the back wall 30 of a cupboard, which is partitioned by a partition wall 31 into an upper chamber 32 where the bus bars 33 arrive and a second chamber 34 wherein the dividing switches are housed. Through the partition wall 31 circular passageways 35 are formed, through which the cups 19 of the respective switches are installed. The gills of each cup 19 sweep the edges of the bore 35 so as to define a passageway which is narrow enough to respect the requirements of safety. It is thus apparent that when the dividing switches are open and the shutters 20 close the mouth of the cup 19, there is a substantial continuity of the partition wall 31, that is to say that the live parts cannot be accessed to from the lower chamber 34, according to the objects of the invention. Anyone skilled in the art can appreciate that such a result is obtained by using a dividing switch which is installed in the work place complete of all its component parts and thus without altering the characte ristic features of the switch as it comes from the factory. If it is desired to be enabled to overhaul the switch very easily and conveniently, a releasable connection can be provided between the bus bars and the fixed contact, as shown in FIGURE 3. In this case,the fixed contact 18 carries an end clip 40 capable of pressurally seizing a terminal 41 which receives the current from its attendant bus bar. With this kind of connection anyone skilled in the art can also provide, apparently, so that the dividing switch 10 is mounted with the insertion of vertical sliding ways on the back wall 30 of the cupboard so as to be capable of controllably performing a short downward stroke for slipping the cup 19 out of the bore 35 so that the dividing switch 10 can be subsequently withdrawn from the cupboard front and it can more conveniently be repaired or completely replaced even with live bus bars. The dividing switch can be also mounted on a wall without requiring any adaptations. Appropriate modifications can be introduced in the dividing switch in order to fulfil quite particular service requirements. More particularly, it is recalled that the parts which are essential to achieve the purposes of the invention substantially require the particular structure of the fixed contact, carried in the interior of the insu lating cup and preferably susceptible of being masked by a shutter. The configuration of the component parts described herein can be modified without departing from the scope of this invention.
