# A process for the preparation of composite crystalline aluminium silicates and their use as catalyst carrier .

## Abstract
Process for the preparation of a composite crystalline aluminum silicate by maintaining an aqueous alkaline starting mixture comprising one or more silicon compounds, one or more aluminium compounds, one or more com pounds of metals from Group 1a of the Periodic Table of the Elements MX and organic nitrogen compounds at an elevated temperature until composite crystalline aluminum silicate has formed and subsequently separating crystalline silicate from the mother liquor, wherein the various com pounds are present in the starting mixture in defined molar ratios. The composite crystalline silicates can be used as catalyst carrier for dewaxing hydrocarbon oils, and for separating hydrocarbons.
