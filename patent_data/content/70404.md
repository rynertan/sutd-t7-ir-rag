# A method and equipment to perform porosimetric analyses.

## Abstract
This invention concerns a method and an equipment to perform porosimetric analyses, in particular following known analyses performed by a so called mercury meth ods, wherein volumetric variations of mercury placed in a vessel are recorded, said variations being due to a mercury penetration into the pores of a solid sample placed in the same vessel under mercury pressure variations. According to the invention further analyses are carried out by lowering mercury pressure from a maximum value substantially to ambient value, following a predetermined law in function of time, for instance and preferably a pres sure reduction at constant speed, and by simultaneously detecting the volume variations of mercury which comes out of the sample pores when pressure decreases. Said detec tion, when performed in relation and or in addition to the traditional one during pressure increase, allows to obtain a pressure volume mercury curve which provides further data on the porosimetric characteristics of the sample, in particular related to the shape of the pores of same.
