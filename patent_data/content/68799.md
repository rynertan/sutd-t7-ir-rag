# TITANIUM TRICHLORIDE CATALYST COMPONENT AND THE PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION THEREOF

## Abstract
A titanium trichloride catalyst component containing a mi nor amount of prepolymerized ethylene and useful in the poly merization of alpha olefins is produced by reducing titanium tetrachloride with an organoaluminum compound at low tem peratures and then treating the resulting reduced solids pro duct with about 1 to 1,000 wt. ethylene so as to obtain a pre polymerized titanium trichloride reduced solid. The prepoly merized reduced solid can thereafter be activated to a highly ac tive prepolymerized titanium trichloride by treating the prepo lymerized reduced solid with a halogenated hydrocarbon and a Lewis base complexing agent or titanium tetrachloride and a Lewis base complexing agent. The prepolymerized reduced solid and the prepolymerized activated titanium trichloride manifests substantially no evidence of friability upon being subjected to mechanical shearing forces. The resulting prepo lymerized activated titanium trichloride composition, when em ployed in combination with an organo metal compound results in an unexpectedly highly active catalyst obtaining polymers with high heptane insolubles.
