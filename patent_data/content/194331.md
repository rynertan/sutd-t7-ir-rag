# Inspecting device for print.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to an inspecting device for a print which can scan the entire print pattern 3 of a printed sheet 3 by an optical detecting device 8 , detects the image information of the print pattern 3 at every pixel, calculates the difference between the detected image information with reference information, delays the differential signal in sever al pixels in the scanning direction of the optical detecting device 8 , calculates the difference between the differential signal and the delayed differential signal, sets a threshold level to the twice differential signal produced from the result, and judges the production of a printing defect when the twice differential signal exceeds the threshold level, thereby accurately detecting the printing defect even when the entire variation in the color density occurs on the printed sheet 3 .
