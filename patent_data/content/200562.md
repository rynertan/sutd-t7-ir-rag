# TRANSDERMAL DELIVERY SYSTEM FOR DELIVERING NITROGLYCERIN AT HIGH TRANSDERMAL FLUXES

## Abstract
A high flux transdermal nitroglycerin therapeutic system is disclosed which is capable of delivering nitroglycerin through intact human skin at rates of 40 ug cm₂hr and preferably in the range of 50 150 ug cm₂hr. Ethanol delivered at a rate of from 250 500 ug cm₂hr is employed as a permeation enhancer for the nitroglycerin and a rate con trolling membrane formed from ethylene vinyl acetate having a vinyl acetate content greater than 11 and preferably between 12 18 provides the appropriate rate control for both the drug and the permeation enhancer. This system is suitable for use in treatment of angina pectoris and congestive heart failure.
