# Spurted polyolefin fibers with improved dispersibility in hydrocarbons, including hydrocarbon containing asphalt compositions and method for making the same.

## Abstract
To an aqueous dispersion of spurted polyolefin pulp is added from about 1 to about 20 , preferably from about 2 to about 12 , by solid weight based on the weight of spurted polyolefin pulp, of an anionic latex containing a rubber or synthetic resin which is swellable in hydrocarbons. The latex is then precipitated onto the spurted polyolefin pulp with a suitable agent, preferably water soluble calcium, magnesium, barium or aluminum salts or calcium or barium hydroxides. When the product is recovered, the resulting natural rubber or synthetic resin treated spurted polyolefin pulp is readily dispersible in hydrocarbons. Because of this, the pulp can be added to cutback asphalt to form viscous compositions which can be readily sprayed, brushed and trowled with minimal pulp separation problems.
