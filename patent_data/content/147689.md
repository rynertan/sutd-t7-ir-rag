# A method of inducing antitumor immunocytes, and a process for producing antitumor immunocytes and antitumor immunocytes produced by the process.

## Abstract
A method of inducing antitumor immunocytes which is simple in operation and suitable for inducing antitumor immunocytes having not only excellent cytotoxic activity against tumor cells but also high safety, which method comprises contacting leucocytes with an insoluble, anti tumor immunocyte inducing material capable of linking with T cells, said antitumor immunocyte inducing material com prising an insoluble carrier and a ligand linked therewith. The induced antitumor immunocytes can be simply separated in substantially ligand free form from the insoluble, antitumor immunocyte inducing material. The obtained antitumor im munocytes have not only excellent cytotoxic activity against tumor cells but also high safety.
