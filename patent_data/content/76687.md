# Speech intelligibility enhancement system and method.

## Abstract
To enhance the intelligibility of speech, the consonant sounds are intensified and, in effect, their intensity equalised to that of the vowel sounds in a speech waveform. A short time estimate of the relative spectral shape of an input speech signal is determined by envelope detectors 24 operating on the outputs of band pass filters 20 . Control means are provided to respond to such relative spectral shape estimate by dynamically controlling a modification of the spectral shape of the actual speech signal so as to produce a modified output speech signal, the control means comprising a combination matrix 28 operating on the outputs of the envelope detectors 24 with a matrix of coefficients and producing weighted signals 29 as control signals. The control signals 29 act on gain selecting logic 30 to determine the gains of multipliers 31 through which respective different portions of the frequency spectrum of the input speech are coupled to a summation circuit 32 producing the consonant enhanced output speech signal, the respective different portions of the frequency spectrum of the input speech being produced by a bank of filters 20 supplying the envelope detectors 24 or by a set of different filters 26 .
