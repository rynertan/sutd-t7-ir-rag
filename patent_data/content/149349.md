# Transfer device.

## Abstract
A transfer device 10 for conveyors 30 has a spiral shaped sweep 11, 11a which is rotated to cause it to engage selected articles on a conveyor and push them off laterally. The sweep is supported on and rotated by a shaft 40, 40a which is inclined to the vertical and toward the conveyor whereby the circular path traced by its outer end is in an inclined plane and as it moves to its retracted position it moves upwardly. As it moves across the conveyor it has a zone of maximum approach to the conveyor surface which moves across the conveyor surface and outwardly along the sweep as the sweep rotates to its maximum extended position.
