# RACK AND PINION STEERING GEAR ASSEMBLY

## Abstract
A housing for a rack and pinion steering gear assembly is made by cold drawing low carbon steel tubing into separate rack and pinion housing sections 5 and 3 . The separate sections have windows 55 and 39 cut therein which are interfaced with one another and the sections are welded together at the periphery of the windows therein to connect the sections in a cross wise relationship with one another allowing teeth of a pinion gear 23 mounted in the pinion gear section to mesh with rack teeth of a rack gear 49 mounted in the rack housing section. A power cylinder 81 is integrally formed with the rack housing section and contains a power piston 99 . Hydraulic lines 31 and 33 connecting the power cylinder to the pinion housing section are welded or brazed to the tubular steel rack and pinion housing sections.
