# Improvements in or relating to resilient mountings.

## Abstract
A resilient mounting 20 e.g. for supporting the ball race of a divided propeller shaft of a motor vehicle, comprises outer and inner rigid members 21 and 22 respectively connected by at least one annular resilient diaphragm in which the outer member is adapted for pivotal movement with respect to a component to which it is secured in use. Radial loads applied to the mounting 20 are accommodated by the diaphragm s and axial loads by the pivot arrange ment whereby the radial stiffness of the diaphragm s may be varied to provide any required radial load capability without affecting the axial deflection capability. Pivotal mounting is effected by a pivot link 32 having a pair of arms 33 each pivotally connected at one end to the outer member 21 and adapted for pivotal connection at the other end to the component to which the mounting is secured in use. Each pivotal connection includes a resilient bush 37 the torsional stiffness of which determines the axial deflection capability. The pivot link 32 is releasably secured to the outer member 21 .
