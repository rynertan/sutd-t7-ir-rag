# PAPER MAKING MACHINERY

## Abstract
A paper making machine includes a dryer section which constitutes 50 or more of the length of the paper machine. It has been proposed to reduce or obviate this dryer section by subjecting the paper sheet simultaneously to high nip pressures and temperatures, but conventional wet press felts are not suitable in a press drying system. The invention is concerned with an endless foraminous belt for releasing moisture from fibrous paper making dispersions or sheets formed therefrom which comprises a flexible corrosion and stretch resistant sheet having a high tensile sheet and formed from fine woven metallic mesh in which the warp and weft filaments are bonded together at their points of intersection, as by sintering. The belts can be used in press drying or in other parts of the paper machine.
