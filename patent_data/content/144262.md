# Electrical power matching system.

## Abstract
This disclosure relates to an electrical power transfer system for matching a load to a DC source such as a solar array. The system tracks the power output of the source under varying operating conditions and matches the load to the source to maintain peak power conditions. The system senses the voltage and the current of the source, incremen tally changes the volt ampere operating point of the source and thereby changes its incremental resistance, and adjusts the load to the level where the ratio of the DC source voltage to the DC source current is substantially equal to the incremental resistance.
