An input shaft 13 connected to the output of the clutch 1 carries a drive gear 21 and a main shaft 20 is connected to the drive pulley. A synchroniz ing mechanism 22 is secured on the main shaft 20 and can be engaged with the drive gear 21 . A counter gear 20 engages with the driver gear 21 . An idler gear 31 can be engaged with a gear 29 on the synchronizer and with a gear 28b of the counter gear 28 to establish reverse drive.
