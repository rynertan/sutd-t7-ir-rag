# Process for producing alkali metal cyanates.

## Abstract
An alkali metal cyanate is prepared by heating a heterogeneous mixture of urea and an alkali metal carbonate in a solvent which selectively dissolves urea, but not the alkali metal carbonate. The reaction mixture may be reacted with a dialkylsul fate to produce the corresponding ethyl isocyanate.
