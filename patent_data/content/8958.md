# Fluorinated benzenesulfonate diacetylenes, a composition containing a polymer derived from these monomers the application of such compounds in time temperature history monitoring devices.

## Abstract
New fluorinated benzenesulfonate diacetylene composi tions are described which are useful in time temperature devices for monitoring the shelf lives of perishable articles. The compositions are solid state polymerizable by thermal annealing or exposure to actinic or high energy ionizing radiation. Some of the compositions, in addition, exhibit relatively longer polymerization induction periods, com pared to other known diacetylene compositons, and an autocatalytic effect upon polymerization during which a rapid color change occurs. These characteristics are extremely useful in monitoring situations which require a striking color change as an indication that a particular time temperature history profile, e.g. shelf life, has expired.
