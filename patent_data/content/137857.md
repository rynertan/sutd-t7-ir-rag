# NUMERICAL CONTROL METHOD.

## Abstract
A method of numerically controlling a machine tool which has two or more tools TL1, TL2, TL3 , such as a multiple spindle automatic lathe, comprises the steps of preparing numerical control dataspecifying a time and a positional relationship between movable spindles X1, X2, X3, Z , numerically controlling the position of each of the movable spindles X1, X2, X3, Z on the basis of the numeri cal control data monitoring to determine whether or not a period of time elapsed matches the time specified by the numerical control data and, when the time elapsed is equal to a period of time specified by the numerical control data for a specific movable spindle, controlling the position of the movable spindle by means of subsequent numerical control data therefor.
