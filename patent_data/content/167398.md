# Ferro electric liquid crystal electro optical device.

## Abstract
A ferro electric liquid crystal electro optical device is driven by a time sharing mode has a panel 6 with a ferro electric liquid crystal material disposed between scan ning electrodes and display electrodes. A drive circuit 4 is arranged so that the panel 6 can be driven by scanning only some of the scanning electrodes for partial rewriting a display produced by the panel. A control circuit 2 controls the drive circuit 4 .
