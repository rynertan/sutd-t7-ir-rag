# Process of combining an antistatic agent with beads of thermoplastic material.

## Abstract
Expanded cellular or foamed thermoplastic cups and containers commonly are readily statically charged and this causes problems, particularly in drink dispensing means. Articles of such material can be made substantially static free by use of a selected surface active agent or emulsifier which may be applied to the surface of the article or to the beads of thermoplastic material from which the article is made. In a process of combining anti static agent and thermo plastic material, an anti static agent, which may be liquid or solid, is misted, atomised or vapourised for coating beads of a thermoplastic material, the beads at the coating stage being unexpanded or pre expanded.
