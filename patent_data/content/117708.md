# FREEZE BLENDING OF REACTIVE LIQUIDS AND SOLIDS

## Abstract
Chemically reactive liquids such as catalyzed monomers and prepolymers are mixed with finely divided solids to form a homogeneous blend by chilling the liquid to a temperature be low its solidification point, forming it into finely divided solidly frozen particulates, chilling the finely divided solids to a tempe rature below the solidification temperature of the reactive liquid and mixing the materials together without allowing the temperature to rise to the liquid soiidification point. The admix ture may then be formed into a permanent shape by warming to a temperature whereat the frozen liquid melts and the liquid is caused to react.
