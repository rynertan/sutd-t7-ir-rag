# Process for manufacturing an ear fitted acoustical hearing aid.

## Abstract
A method of making a hearing aid begins with an impression of the ear concha 4 and canal 6 . A wax coating is applied over the surface of the impression to fill in depressions created by skin pores. A base plate 10 is shaped to the bottom portion of the mould. A top portion 12 of the mould is then formed over the remainder of the ear impression. The mould is then cut open to remove the original ear cast. After resealing of this opening, a top opening is cut. This opening is preferably formed by cutting off the extended portion 6a impression of the ear canal. The mould is filled with a hardenable acrylic material until it is full the hardening of the material is carefully timed so that only the mould has permanentaly formed. The remainder of the acrylic hardening material is then poured out, and the ear hearing aid is removed.
