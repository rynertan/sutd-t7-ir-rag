# Drive for rotary drum.

## Abstract
A substantially horizontal rotating drum 1 mounted on roller pairs 2, 3 , and driven via the rollers by means of a hydrostatic motor 5 for each drive roller 2 . In order to avoid problems e.g. stoppage if the contact be tween the drum 1 and one or more drive rollers 2 ceases, each hydrostatic motor is part of a separate power circuit further comprising a hydrostatic pump 9 and a squirrel cage motor 10 constantly ensuring essentially the same peripheral speed for drum 1 and drive roller 2 irrespective of torque variation.
