# Electrochemical flow cell for liquid chromatography.

## Abstract
An amperometric cell 23 modified for high pressure operation is described. The cell 23 has particular utility for use with a liquid chromatography separation and when placed in line upstream of sample injection 24 , will remove selected electroactive components in the carrier fluid and thereby reduce background level of contaminents reaching the column 23 and eluting from the column. The cell 23 may also be placed in line following sample injection 24 whereby it may be employed to electrochemically modify selected materials in the mobile phase whereby to change their chromatographic characteristics.
