# Method of producing ferrite single crystals.

## Abstract
A method of producing ferrite single crystals which comprises steps of melting a ferrite starting material in an atmosphere having a total pressure greater than 1 atm and containing oxygen at a partial pressure higher than in the air and a rare gas, nitrogen or carbon dioxide at a partial pressure of at least 0.1 atm and solidifying the melt. By this method, the popping out of the gas contained in the melt can be prevented and the ferrite single crystals of high quality can be produced more easily. Fig. 2 shows how a rod 21 of ferrite starting material is melted 26 on a susceptor 23 heated by radiofrequency induction 24 , and passes through openings 27 in the susceptor, to re crystallise below in single crystal form 22 .
