## Description
This invention relates to a novel and effective pharmaceutical controlled release formulation for oral administration. When a controlled release pharmaceutical formulation is administered to a living body, intra or inter individual variations in effect occur frequently influenced by factors in the pharmaceutical formulation or factors in the living body. One of the factors in the living body is a variation in gastrointestinal transit time. A formulation which reduces the effect of this factor is known H.Bechgaad and G.H.Nielsen, Drug Devel.Ind.Pharm., Hitherto, there are known various materials and various production processes for obtaining individual particles e.g.,microcapsules, microspheres etc., of controlled release pharmaceutical formulations containing an active substance. For example, waxes, lipids, water insoluble macromolecular materials, ion exchange resins, etc., are known as the above mentioned materials. A production process for individual particles frequently requires a complicated and long step of preparing granules containing an active substance and other material s and applying thereto an enteric coating. In such a production process the production cost is frequently high and the reproducibility of the dissolving characteristics of products is not good. As a material for forming a structured particle that is not easily disintegrated in the gastrointestinal tract, crystalline cellulose formerly microcrystalline cellulose is known. A pharmaceutical formulation using crystalline cellulose in an amount of about 10 to 40 by weight based on the weight of the formulation is described in Japanese Patent publication No.5275 70. The above described patent describes a controlled release pharmaceutical formulation containing as active substance bis o benzoylthiamine disulfide, but an enteric coating is necessary in order to prolong the release time. The pharmaceutical formulation of the patent has a structure which does not easily disintegrate in the gastrointestinal tract. It is known that if the amount of crystalline cellulose is about 10 to 40 by weight, the pharmaceutical formulation is insufficiently strong and also generally provide insufficient controlled release of active substance. GB A 1561204 discloses a sustained release formulation which is a hard gelatin capsule containing spheroids made of propranolol or salt thereof and crystalline cellulose alone, the spheroids being exemplified as made by mixing these components with water and then extruding, spheronising and drying to give the sustained release formulation, these spheroids have to be film coated before encapsulation. Furthermore, European Patent Publication 80341A describes an invention of oral pharmaceutical controlled release multiple units formulation . However, in the invention, cores are produced by a complicated process and also enteric coating is applied thereto for obtaining controlled release. Moreover, the above described pharmaceutical formulation does not disintegrate in the stomach and is prepared with the addition of disintegrants so that the coating is eroded and the core itself disintegrates in the small intestine. DD A 104027 discloses granulating mixtures of active substance, incompressible filler, and organic solvent solution of organic binder the only fillers exemplified are inorganic materials it is mentioned that cellulose may be used as a filler, and the requirement for low compressibility means that this would be non crystalline. GB A 2075839 discloses sustained release granules made by granulating mixtures of active substance, long chain fatty acid metal salt, crystalline cellulose diluent, and aqueous solution of water soluble binder or organic solvent solution of water insoluble binder. DE A 3325652 discloses granulating a mixture including active substance, inorganic filler, crystalline cellulose and a solution of organic polymer in organic solvent, and then tabletting the granules with other ingredients in other embodiments the ingredients are tabletted directly the disclosed products are not indicated to be sustained release formulations. Chemical Abstracts, 1980, 93, 13003e discloses direct tabletting, without previous granulating, of a mixture of active substance, starch, crystalline cellulose and Mg stearate. The present invention providces a method for making granules for a controlled release pharmaceutical formulation, the method comprising granulating, to give granules of a diameter of from 0.1 to 1.5 mm, a mixture of a 5 2 2 o ethyoxyphenoxy ethylamino propyl 2 methoxybenzene sulfonamide hydrochloride, b crystalline cellulose carrier in an amount of at least 50 solids wt. of the mixture and c release control agent comprising water and water insoluble macromolecular substance, the release control agent being in the form of an aqueous emulsion or suspension or gel of said macromolecular substance or in the form of a solution of said macromolecular substance in an aqueous organic solvent, and said macromolecular substance being selected from acrylic acid series polymers and copolymers and cellulose derivatives, the amount of the release controlling agent being up to 30 as solid component or 50 150 as aqueous liquid material based on the weight of the granules. It also proovides a pharmaceutical sustained release formulation comprising granules of a diameter of from 0.1 to 1.5 mm obtainable by adding release control agent comprising water and water insoluble macromolecular substance to a mixture of 5 2 2 o ethyoxyphenoxy ethylamino propyl 2 methoxybenzene sulfonamide hydrochloride and crystalline cellulose carrier and granulating the resultant mixture, the crystalline cellulose carrier constituting at least 50 by weight of the solids in the mixture and the composition and amount of the release control agent being as defined for c above. The controlled release pharmaceutical formulation of the present invention is suitable for oral administration, can show a reproducible dissolution rate without enteric coating, and can be simply produced. The granulation product active substance containing granules of this invention may be water permeable but is not substantially disintegrated i.e., scarcely disintegrates or does not disintegrate for at least a few hours in the gastrointestinal tract. Also, the pharmaceutical formulation of this invention has a high physical strength and the product is rarely crushed when formed into tablets by compression. Furthermore, by properly selecting an enteric coating agent and properly controlling the compounding ratio thereof in the preparation of the granulation product active substance containing granules , a granulation product having the desired dissolving characteristics can be obtained. The purpose of the crystalline cellulose carrier is to provide, on granulation, cohesive units granules containing the active substance. The material used as carrier is capable of forming a structured particle of the formulation. The amount of carrier is at least 50 by weight, preferably at least 70 by weight based on the solids weight of the granules. The release controlling agent in this invention is involved as a binding agent for granulation. Suitable water insoluble macromolecular materials for use in this agent include acrylic acid series polymers, acrylic acid series copolymers, and cellulose derivatives such as ethyl cellulose,hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose phthalate,and hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose acetate succinate. The release controlling agent is suitably used in the form of an aqueous suspension, an aqueous emulsion, or a water containing organic solvent solution. They are also commercially available as, for example, Eudragit L 30 D Röhm Co., trade name aqueous suspension of a methacrylic acid ethyl acrylate copolymer , Eudragit E 30 D aqueous suspension of an ethyl acrylate methyl methacrylate copolymer , Aquacoat ECD 30 aqueous suspension of ethyl cellulose , etc., which can be used as the release controlling agent as they are or diluted with water. Also, low substituted hydroxypropyl cellulose L HPC or ethyl cellulose can be used as an aqueous gel. Furthermore, water insoluble polymers may be used as solution systems in a water base mixed solvent containing an organic solvent. The amount of release controlling agent is generally up to 30 as solid component or 50 150 as aqueous liquid material by weight based on the weight of the granules. In this invention, for controlling the dissolving characteristics of an active substance, an alkaline earth metal salt or an alkali metal salt of a higher fatty acid or an enterosoluble polymer may be added to the formulation. The addition of the aforesaid material is effective when the physiologically active substance is a so called micromedicament. Examples of the alkaline earth metal salt or alkaline metal salt of a higher fatty acid are magnesium stearate, and calcium stearate. Also, examples of the enterosoluble polymers are cellulose acetate phthalate, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose phthalate, and a methacrylic acidmethyl methacrylate copolymer Eudragit L, S . The compounding amount thereof is usually 1 to 15 by weight. When such enterosoluble polymer is used a plasticiser such as PEG 6000, Tween 80 trade name , and triacetin, may be added. The compounding amount thereof is usually 0 to 15 by weight based on the weight of the release controlling agent solid component . In addition, an alkaline metal halide or an alkaline earth metal halide, such as sodium chloride, and calcium chloride can be used for the same purpose. As described above, the release of the physiologically active substance can be controlled by selecting the kind of the release controlling agent and or controlling the compounding amount of the alkaline earth metal salt or alkaline metal salt of a higher fatty acid or an enterosoluble polymer. According to the characteristics of the active substance, the release thereof can be also delayed by subjecting the active substance itself to a hydrophobic treatment. The hydrophobic treatment can be performed by microcapsulating the active substance by, for example a spray congealing method used wax. Examples of the wax which may be used for the purpose are hydrogenated vegetable oils such as hydrogenated castor oil. There is no particular restriction on the physiologically active substance for use in this invention. The amount of the active substance is generally less than 30 by weight based on the weight of the granules. In the test examples and examples described hereinbelow, 5 2 2 o ethoxyphenoxy ethylamino propy 2 methoxybenzenesulfonamide hydrochloride YM 12617 having a relatively low solubility in water about 0.3 to 0.5 was used as the active substance. YM 12617 shows an α blocking action and can be used for the treatment of hyperpiesia, cardiac insufficiency, lower urinary disease, etc. The formulation of this invention may also contain any of the usual additives or excipients such as filler, and coloring agent. Suitably, the mixture of active substance, carrier substance and optionally alkaline earth metal salt or an alkali metal salt of a higher fatty acid or an enterosoluble polymer is granulated after the addition of the above described aqueous liquid material as a release controlling agent. Granulation can be performed by an agitation type apparatus, a rotation type apparatus, a centrifugal type apparatus, a fluidized bed type apparatus, or an apparatus of mixed types. The size diameter of the granulation product particles is suitably 0.1 to 1.5 mm, preferably 0.2 to 1.0 mm. The individual active substance containing particles can be formed into larger units such as tablets, capsules, granules, etc. The active substance containing particles of this invention have a high mechanical strength, and mostly do not disintegrate when formed into tablets. They disperse widely in the gastrointestinal tract when they are administered to a living body. Also, they are water permeable but do not substantially disintegrate they gradually release active substance into the gastrointestinal tract, whereby a long controlled release can be attained. Also, intra and inter subject variations are very small and the physiological effects are excellent in reproducibility. Furthermore, the pharmaceutical formulation of this invention can be obtained by a simple and safe production process. Tests and results showing dissolution characteristics and concentrations in plasma of the active substance of the controlled release formulation of this invention are described below. The test was performed by the paddle method of the 2nd dissolution test method in the Japan Pharmacopoeia. That is, the test was performed by a UV method or a liquid chromatograph method shown below at a rotation speed of the paddle of 150 r.p.m., using 500 ml of a 1st liquid artificial gastric juice of the Japanese Pharmacopoeia and 500 ml of a 2nd liquid artificial intestinal juice of the Japanese Pharmacopoeia, respectively. A sample was first tested in the 1st liquid for one hour followed by the test in the 2nd liquid for one hour. The pharmaceutical formulation obtained in each example shown below was used as a sample. The amount of each sample corresponding to 50 mg of YM 12617 was subjected to the aforesaid dissolution test, the dissolved liquid was filtered, and the active substance in the filtrate was determined at a detection wavelength of 278 nm. The pharmaceutical formulation prepared in each example was used as a sample. The amount of the sample corresponding to 1 mg of YM 12617 was subjected to the aforesaid dissolution test, the dissolved liquid was filtered, and the active substance was determined under the following conditions. Detector Ultraviolet Spectrophotometer Detection wavelength of 225 nm Column In a stainless tube of about 4 mm inside diameter and about 150 mm length was packed about 5 µm of octadecylsililated silica gel e.g., Nucleosil 5C18, trade name as a packing agent Column Temperature About 35 C. Mobile Phase Mixture of 0.05N perchloric acid and acetonitrile 7 3 . Flow rate Constant amount of 0.8 to 1.5 ml per minute. The results thus obtained are shown in Table 1. As is clear from Fig. 1, in the case of administering the tablets prepared in Example 15, the concentration pattern of the active substance in plasma was good and showed the following features. As is clear from Fig. 2, in the case of administrating the tablets prepared in Example 16, the concentration pattern of the active substance in plasma was good and showed the following features. As is clear from Fig. 3, in the case of administering capsules prepared in Example 17, the concentration patterns of the active substance in plasma are good and show the following features The rotation speed of the paddle in the dissolution test 1 described above was changed and the influence of the rotation speed on the dissolution rate was studied. The active substance was determined by UV method. . The results thus obtained are shown in Table 6. As is clear from Table 6, it can be seen that there is no change of the dissolution characteristics with change of rotation speed. Hence, the motion of the gastrointestinal tract in the living body scarcely influences the dissolution rate of the formulation of this invention. The product obtained in each example was stored under severe conditions shown in Table 7 below for one month and then the dissolution test as in above described test 1 was performed on the product. In this case, the determination of the active substance was performed by UV method. The results thus obtained are shown in Table 7. As is clear from the above results, when the samples of this invention are stored under the severe conditions, the change in the dissolution characteristics is very small and thus, the formulations are stable to the passage of time. Three samples were prepared by the same manner as in Example 4 and the dissolution test as above was performed on each sample the determination of the active substance was performed by UV method . The results thus obtained are shown in Table 8. From the results shown in Table 8, it can be seen that the samples of this invention show good dissolution reproducibility.
