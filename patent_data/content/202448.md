## Description
The present invention relates to hydraulic lash adjusting tappets of the type having a roller follower for contacting the cam shaft in an internal combustion engine valve gear. In modern overhead cam type engine valve gear, it has been desired to reduce the power consumption of the valve gear by providing roller followers on the hydraulic tappet to reduce the frictional forces created by contact of the engine cam shaft with the tappet. However, in valve gear of the overhead cam type where the tappet is the only link between the cam shaft and the valve rocker arm, i.e. where there is no push rod between the tappet and the rocker arm, space constraints have made the incorporation of roller follower tappets in existing engines quite difficult. Where an existing valve gear of the overhead cam type having flat base tappets contacting the cam is desired to be converted to roller follower tappets, it has been found difficult to provide for maintaining proper tappet orientation and the addition of the roller follower within the length constraints established for the engine by the fixed distance between the cam shaft and the rocker arm. When converting an overhead cam engine valve gear to roller follower tappets, it is necessary to not only shorten the hydraulic lash adjusting components by an amount sufficient to provide for the incorporation of the roller follower, but it is also necessary to provide for orientation of the tappet to maintain the alignment of the roller follower with the cam. It is also necessary to maintain the supply of fluid from the engine oil flow circuit to the interior of the tappet for supplying the hydraulic lash adjusting valve. Tappets of the type having flat base frictional contact with the cam lobe may rotate freely in the tappet guide bore in the engine. In order to maintain the tappet roller oriented properly with respect to the engine cam load, registration surfaces are usually provided on the tappet for sliding engagement with a guide means provided on the engine to maintain the proper tappet orientation. This problem of length constraints is not encountered in retrofitting engines having push rod type valve gear with roller follower tappets such as shown in Fig. 8 because the tappet may be increased in length to accommodate the roller follower and the orientation means or registration surfaces and the wide circumferential collector groove employed to fluidly connect with the engine oil circuit left intact, and the push rod shortened accordingly to compensate for the increased tappet length. The present invention enables an overhead cam type valve gear for an internal combustion engine having hydraulic lash adjusting tappets to be retrofitted with such tappets having roller followers for contacting the cam to absorb less power from the engine in the valve gear. The present invention provides a unique and novel hydraulic lash adjuster having a roller follower on one end of the tappet body and suitable means for registration provided on the opposite end for sliding contact with a guide to maintain the roller properly oriented for contact with the engine cam shaft. The present invention enables a roller follower tappet to be retrofitted in an engine having a overhead cam type valve gear without altering the distance between the cam shaft and the valve rocker arm. The novel tappet of the present invention incorporates the roller follower registration surfaces in the tappet and does not exceed the length allowed for a tappet not having such features. The tappet of the present invention provides for an oil feed circuit from the passage in the tappet guide bore in the engine to the one way valve within the tappet by providing a novel registration means and a localized collector means at a longitudinally common station oriented by the registration means for feeding the oil inlet hole in the tappet from the engine gallery to the tappet guide bore. Referring now to Figure 1, the tappet of the present invention is indicated generally at 10 as received in a guide bore 12 provided in the cylinder head H of an internal combustion engine having a combustion chamber valve 14 with a stem 16 contacting the pivoted rocker arm R at one end thereof, with the opposite end of the rocker arm contacting the upper end of tappet 10. The lower end of the tappet 10 has a roller follower 18 which contacts in rolling engagement a cam shaft 20 rotatably mounted in the engine. The cylinder head H has an oil gallery 22 which communicates via passage 24 with the bore 12. Referring now to Figure 2, the tappet 10 has the body 26 thereof slidably received in bore 12 in closely fitting contact therewith. The tappet body 26 has orienting registration means comprising an especially configured surfaces such as a pair of flats 28, 29, one of which is indicated at 28 on the body 26 adjacent the upper end thereof in Fig. 2. The flats 28, 29 are on opposite sides of the body 26, which registration surfaces or flats 28, 29 slidably engage a corresponding configured aperture not shown formed in a retaining guide 30 received over the upper end of the tappet. The registration surfaces or flats such as 28 function when registered against the sides of the aperture in guide 30, to orient the tappet in the bore so as to insure proper alignment of the axis of roller follower 18 for running contact with the cam 20. A pair of diametrically opposed localized collector resesses indicated by reference numerals 34, 36 are provided which communicate with a collector groove 32 formed circumferentially about the periphery. An oil inlet hole 38 is provided in recess 34 and communicates with the lash adjustment valve means not shown provided on the interior of the tappet 10 in a manner well known in the art. Referring to Figure 4, the oil inlet hole 38 is formed through the wall of body 26 and is shown as providing a passage for engine lubricating oil into the interior of the tappet mechanism to facilitate lash adjustment. A plunger assembly 40 is moveably received in the body 26 and extends from the upper end of the tappet body 26 in Figure 2 or the rightward end in Figures 3 and 4 for contacting the rocker arm R and maintaining the lash adjusted length of the tappet. The passage of oil through the inlet hole 38 to the interior of the body for supplying the lash adjustment mechanism is shown in solid black line with black arrowheads in Figure 4. It will be understood that the tappet body 26 may be assembled into the engine bore 12 with either of the recesses 34, 36 oriented to be adjacent the oil passage 24 when the bracket 30 is received over and registered against the registration flats 28, 29. Thus, no concern need be given during assembly as to orientation of the tappet once the bracket 30 is engaged with the registration flats. With particular reference to Figure 2, the tappet is shown assembled into the engine bore 12 with the localized recess 34 disposed remotely or 180 away, from the oil passage 24. When the tappet is assembled in the engine as shown in Fig. 2, the oil inlet hole 38 receives oil from passage 24 via recess 36, oil groove 32 and recess 34 as shown in solid black line with black arrowheads in Figure 2. It will be understood that the tappet 10 is illustrated in Figure 2 in the downwardmost, or valve closed, position with the roller 18 contacting the cam 20 on its base circle. In the base circle position of Figure 2, the tappet body 26 has the exterior oil collector groove 32 provided thereon located such that the upper edge of the groove is below the lower surface of the oil passage 24. However, the localized recesses 34, 36 each have a sufficient longitudinal extent along the surface of the tappet body 26 so that fluid communication is always maintained from engine oil passage 24 to tappet oil inlet 38. The construction of the tappet of the present invention permits the oil collector groove 32 as shown in Figure 2, to pass oil around the circumference of the tappet from the localized collector 36 when the tappet is on the base circle of the cam and the collector groove 32 cannot communicate directly with the passage 24. This arrangement enables room for the flats 28, 29 to be provided on the outer periphery of the tappet body to accomodate the full lift stroke of the tappet as the cam rotates. The embodiment of Fig. 2 also provides sufficient surface area around the periphery of the tappet in a region above the groove 32 for cooperation with the wall of bore 12 to provide a land for leakage control to prevent rapid flow of oil from groove 32 to the flats 28, 29 and a corresponding loss of oil pressure in the engine oil circuit. Referring to Fig. 7, another embodiment indicated generally of 50 of the invention is shown in which the body 52 has registration means comprising a single flat 54 formed on the periphery of the body at the end adjacent the moveable plunger assembly 56. The tappet 50 also has a roller follower means 58 provided on the end of the body remote from plunger assembly 56. The single flat 54 is adapted to be installed in a corresponding configured aperture not shown in a guide bracket, such as bracket 30 see Figs. 1 and 2 . The tappet of Fig. 7 has a localized collector recess 60 provided on the periphery thereof and spaced circumferentially, preferably 90 , from the registration flat 54. The recess 60 is located at a longitudinal station coincident with flat 54 and engine oil feed passage 24 when the tappet 50 is assembled in the engine bore 12. The recess 60 extends longitudinally along the tappet periphery a distance sufficient to maintain the recess 60 always in fluid communication with engine oil passage 24 throughout the full lift cycle of the cam 20. Recess 60 has a tappet fluid inlet port 62 located therein for communicating fluid to the interior of the tappet for operation of the hydraulic lash adjusting movement of plunger 56. The embodiment of Fig. 7, thus permits the oil inlet to be longitudinally at a common station with registration flat 54, yet maintain sufficient leakage control surface for preventing loss of oil pressure by too rapid flow to flat 54. The embodiment of Fig. 7 also eliminates concern for tappet orientation during assembly into the engine. The present invention thus provides a compact roller follower hydraulic lash adjuster which enables retrofitting of roller follower tappets in an existing overhead cam engine having flat face cam tappets without the need to alter the location of the cam with respect to the other valve gear components. The present invention provides proper orientation of the tappet for feeding of oil to the tappet lash adjusting mechanism irrespective of the orientation of the tappet in the engine bore when registered against the guide means for aligning the roller follower correctly with respect to the cam shaft. Although the invention has been described hereinabove with respect to the illustrated embodiments, it will be understood that modifications and variations of the invention may be made by those having ordinary skill in the art and the invention is limited only by the following claims.
