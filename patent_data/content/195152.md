## Description
This invention relates to the field of solid state electronics and, more specifically, to a process of forming compound semiconductive materials. A number of compound semiconducive materials are considered promising for use in thin film photovoltaic devices. CuInSe₂ is a good example, It has a band gap Eg of 1.04 electron volts eV and can absorb almost the entire useful spectrum of sunlight at a thickness of less than 1 micrometer, herein after named micron um . As disclosed in Mickelsen et al., U. S. Patent No. 4,335,266, efficiencies of over 10 have been reported in thin film CuInSe₂ CdS devices. CuInSe₂ is a defect structure compound having electrical properties which depend dramatically on its composition. It is not easily doped and, in bulk form, exists in many phases. The conductivity type of the material is a function of the ratio of its constituent elements. The material is The resistivity of CuInSe₂ for photovoltaic purposes is so highly dependent upon composition that it is quite difficult to control by the usual deposition methods. This relationship is illustrated in Figure 2, which is a graphical representation of resistivity as a function of Cu to In ratio. The slope of the resistiviy curve changes sharply and, therefore, even minor deviations in the Cu In ratio produce extreme variations in resistivity. Mickelsen et al., Similarly, CdTe CdS solar cells have been proposed, but the known methods of producing them are not ideal. Cells of this type are described in Tyan, U. S. Patent No, 4,207,119, and Nakayama et al., Screen Printed Thin Film CdS CdTe Solar Cell , CdTe has also been electrodeposited in alloy form, as described in Kroger et al., Cathodic Deposition of CdTe from Aqueous Electrolytes , In another context, Cd layers have been deposited on Te substrates, as described in Yokota et al., Growth of CdTe on Te Substrates by Solid State Reaction , Also of interest is a process described in Grindle et al., Preparation and Properties of CuInS₂ Films Produced by Exposing RF Sputtered Cu In Films to an H₂S Atmosphere , Reference should also be made to Chu et al., Large Grain Copper Indium Diselenide Films , The present invention relates to a process as claimed in claim 1. An important aspect of the process of the present invention is exceedingly accurate control over the stoichiometric makeup of the compound semiconductive product. Because the constituent elements can be deposited as discrete deposits such as films, a high degree of deposition control can be achieved as to the quantity of each constituent element deposited. Also, the deposition of one constituent element is not complicated nor constrained by concurrent or sequential deposition of another constituent element or elements. The amount of each constituent element is determined by the thickness of the correponding deposit and is unchanged by other depositions of other constituent elements or heat treatments. Upon heat treatment, the constituent elements can interdiffuse and chemically react with each other in the solid phase to produce a thin homogeneous deposit such as a film of the compound semiconductive material, and including a further constituent element from the atmosphere in which it was heated. Cu and In are separately deposited and then heated in a reactive atmosphere of H₂Se, to yield a homogeneous thin film of CuInSe₂ in which the ratio of Cu to In is very precisely controlled. Resistivity of the material is controlled in this way, thereby obviating the need for depositing two discrete compositions of CuInSe₂ in the manner required by Mickelsen et al. In the electrodepositions, electrical current and time can be controlled rather easily to within milliamperes 10 ³ amps and milliseconds 10 ³ sec. , respectively. Thus, the charge transferred in the deposition process can be controlled to within 10 ⁶ coulombs. Assuming a single charge or first order reaction, and recognizing that one coulomb represents 6.25 x 10¹⁸ electrons, the electrodeposition reaction is easily controllable to within approximately 10¹³ atoms. In practice, current and time can be controlled to much less than milliamperes and milliseconds, allowing even better control of the number of atoms deposited. By comparison with these figures, a film one square centimeter in area and one atom thick would contain approximately 10¹⁵ atoms, assuming an atomic diameter between 0.3 and 0.4 nm 3 and 4 angstroms . Diffusion of constituent elements by the process of the present invention takes place at a temperature much lower than the melting point of the compound semiconductive material being formed. For example, CuInSe₂ has a melting point of approximately 1000 decrees Celsius C but its constituent elements can be diffused together to form the same material at a temperature of approximately 400 C. The product is a polycrystalline thin film of small grain size from about 1 to above 5 microns which is well suited for use in a CuInSe₂ CdS photovoltaic device. In the heating step of the present invention, diffusion and chemical reaction take place essentially simultaneously in the solid phase to produce the desired compound semiconductive material. In this context, the phrase constituent element refers to one of the basic chemical constituents of the semiconductive material, e.g., Cu in CuInSe₂, and not to a mere dopant or interstitial component. The process of the present invention is thus much different than simple diffusion as encountered in many solid state doping processes. This invention is ideally suited for use in the formation of CuInSe₂ because Cu and Se are both very fast diffusers. Any required homogeneity of the compound semiconductor product can thus be achieved in a relatively short period of time. The above and other features of this invention may be more fully understood from the following detailed description. taken together with the accompanying drawings, wherein similar reference characters refer to similar elements throughout and in which Referring now to FIGURE 1, there is illustrated a thin film solar cell 10 constructed according to one embodiment of this invention. Cell 10 comprises a substrate 12, a metallic back contact 14, a pair of stacked The process of this invention involves electrodeposition of a plurality of deposits containing different constituent elements of the desired compound semiconductive material, and subsequent heating of the films to produce such semiconductive material, e. g., as an essentially homogeneous layer produced by interdiffusion and chemical reaction of the constituent elements. The heating process is conducted in a reactive atmosphere containing yet another constituent element of the semiconductor so that the constituent element in the atmosphere also enters the deposits and reacts to form the desired semiconductor. FIGURE 3 illustrates a series of steps 26 through 32 for implementing the process of this invention. In the context of cell 10 of FIGURE 1, step 26 involves cleaning and preparing substrate 12 for application of the back contact 14 thereto. Substrate 12 is a supporting material which can be either electrically conductive or nonconductive, for example, metal, glass, ceramic, or other low cost material. It the substrate is nonconductive, then an electrically conductive layer is formed thereon to serve as an electrode in the later electrodeposition steps. For example, if alumina Al₂O₃ is substrate 12, contact 14 can be a thin film of molybdenum Mo or other suitable metal. Film 14 may be applied by sputtering or other suitable method to a depth, for example, of from about 1.0 to about 1.5 microns. After substrate 12 and back contact 14 have been prepared, two constituent elements of layer 16 are sequentially deposited thereon, as indicated by steps 28 and 30. The resulting configuration is illustrated in FIGURE 4a, wherein films 1 and 2 are designated 34 and 36, respectively. The films are each at least approximately 300 nm 3,000 angstroms thick. When CuInSe₂ is the compound semiconductive material of layer 16, films 34 and 36 comprise Cu and In, respectively, and are each deposited in accordance with this invention, by electrodeposition. In this embodiment, films 34 and 36 are deposited sequentially and in independent fashion, so that the resulting films are substantially discrete. After deposition, films 34 and 36 are heated for a time sufficient to cause formation of the semiconductor material, for example, by interdiffusion and chemical reaction of the constituent elements between the films. For electrodeposited films of Cu and In, heating takes place at approximately 400 C. Cu diffuses rapidly at that temperature, while Mo contact 14 remains stationary and intact. During the heating process, the films are subjected to a reactive atmosphere containing Se. This causes Se to enter the films and react therewith to produce CuInSe₂ in precise atomic ratios. As seen in FIGURE 4b, film 16 is substantially thicker than combined films 34 and 36 because the third constituent element Se of layer 16 is added to the extent that it makes up approximately 50 atomic percent of the final semiconductive material. The above described process of selenization can be accomplished in numerous ways, for example, in the atmosphere of a diffusion furnace similar to that designated 38 in FIGURE 5. Furnace 38 is a flow through furnace having first and second chambers 40 and 42, separated by baffle 44. A number of samples 46 of FIGURE 4a in chamber 42 are heated to a preselected temperature. During the heating process, argon gas 48 is passed through chamber 40 and into chamber 42, carrying with it Se from source 50. Source 50 is a source of H₂Se gas not shown . Samples 46 are subjected to a reactive Se atmosphere during the heating process, permitting Se to diffuse into and react with films 34 and 36. Resulting layer 16 comprises a homogeneous film of CuInSe₂ having a thickness of from about 1 to about 3 microns. It is preferred that layer 16 be about 2 microns thick to avoid short circuits due to possible structural defects. The Highly efficient CuInSe₂ CdS solar cells have been made by the process described above. In such cells, Cu and In were electrodeposited as discrete layers on a Mo back contact 14 approximately 1 micron thick. Cu film 34 was deposited from an electrolyte bath having a composition of 0.5 M CuSO₄ 0.8 M H₂SO₄ , at a constant current density of 80 mA per square centimeter. Cu was applied to a thickness of approximately 0.71 mg of Cu over the depostion area. The In film 36 was then applied from a commercially available electrolyte bath of indium sulfamate. Indium was deposted using pulse plating techniques at a base current of 0 and a peak current of 40 milliamperes mA per square centimeter. The duration of each pulse was 0.1 seconds, with a rest time of 0.2 seconds between pulses. Film 36 was plated to a thickness of approximately 0.4 microns, representing approximately 1.31 milligrams mg of In over the deposition area. Thus, the ratio of Cu to In between layers 34 and 36 was approximately 0.92. After deposition, films 34 and 36 were placed in diffusion furnace 38 for heating and selenization. Selenization continued for approximately one hour at about 400 C. and autogenous pressure, followed by annealing at the same temperature for approximately two hours. Finally, the furnace was shut off and the films and the substrate were cooled to room temperature under a flow of argon gas. Selenization was accomplished under 1.5 H₂Se gas in argon at a flow rate of 50 cubic centimeters per minute STP , yielding the compound semiconductive layer 16 depicted in FIGURE 4b. CdS layer 18 of the cell was applied by thermal evaporation over layer 16, to a thickness of approximately 2 microns. For purposes of experimental measurement, front electrode 20 and AR coating 22 were eliminated from the cell in favor of a transparent conductive layer of indium tin oxide ITO having a sheet resistivity of 41 ohms per square. The transparent conductive layer overlying the CdS layer 18, formed the front contact of the cell. A substrate holder 52 for use in electrodepositing the constituents of layer 16 is illustrated in FIGURES 6 and 7. The holder has a frame portion 54, a backing plate 56 and a handle portion 58, of which the portions 54 and 58 are preferably made of a substantially inert and nonconductive material, such as a commercial fluorocarbon polymer. The frame portion defines a chamber 60 for reception of the substrate 12 and a pressure plate 62, and has an inwardly directed flange 64. The flange forms a rectangular opening 66 and carries a resilient seal 68 and a metallic strip 70 facing the chamber. The pressure plate and the substrate are urged outwardly against the flange by a spring 72 confined by the backing plate. The backing plate is sealed to the frame portion by a resilient element 76. In this configuration, the metallic strip 70 contacts the Mo film of the substrate to apply an electrodeposition potential to the film. The seal 68 is located inwardly of the metallic strip 70, providing a fluid seal with the No film to isolate the strip from a surrounding electrolyte bath. The strip is preferably made of platinum and is connected to a conductive wire 78 which extends from the handle portion 58 for connection to a suitable power supply not shown . In operation, substrate 12, with the Mo contact film 14 applied to the outer surface thereof, is mounted within holder 52 for sequential deposition of the required elements. Peripheral contact to Mo film is achieved through the holder, permitting uniform deposition without establishing permanent electrical connection to the film. With the substrate in place within the holder, it can be moved with the holder from one electrolyte bath to another to deposit films of the different constituent elements. Following electrodeposition, the substrate can be removed from the holder and placed in the furnace 38 of Figure 5, where it is subjected to the diffusion and reaction processes described above. It will be understood that electrodeposition according to the process of the present invention can be performed either on a conductive back electrode material, such a contact film 14 of cell 10, or on a transparent conductive oxide layer not shown . The oxide layer will generally be deposited on glass prior to electrodeposition of the constituent elements, and must be sufficiently conductive to provide a substantially uniform current density distribution during electrodeposition. The heating step to form the final semiconductive material can be carried out at essentially atmospheric or autogenous pressure and at a temperature of from about 150 to about 500 C for a time sufficient to form a finite amount of the desired semiconductive material. The reactive atmosphere can be a mixture of any known inert gas such as argon, xenon, helium, and the like, and the desired amount of the reactive constituent. Electrodeposition and the conditions for carrying out same are known in the art and, therefore, substantial description of these steps is not necessary to inform the art. However, generally an electrolyte is employed from which the constituents are deposited. The electrolyte composition can vary widely so long as it is essentially non deleterious, chemically or physically, to the substrate and can be either aqueous in nature such as an aqueous solution having the constituent element or elements dissolved therein or non aqueous such as a fused salt containing the constituent element or elements. When an aqueous electrolyte is employed, the electrodeposition step will be carried out at an elevated temperature not essentially greater than about 90 C. When a non aqueous electrolyte is employed the elevated temperature should not be essentially greater than 500 C. The electrodeposition step can be carried out over a wide variety of electrical current densities but will generally be in the range of from about 1 to about 300 milliamperes per square centimeter. The various constituent elements will be deposited in the various steps of the process in predetermined, desired stoichometric ratios which, after the heating step, will produce the final semiconductive material containing the constituent elements in their desired relative atomic ratios, for example, an atomic ratio of 1 Cu 1 In 2 Se. By employing electrodeposition techniques in the formation of semiconductive materials of the type covered by this invention, very precise control of the relative amounts of the constituent elements present in the final semiconductive material is achieved. Further, with this invention such precise control of constituent element ratios in the final product is accomplished within a processing time period which is rapid as well as precise. Thus, the formation of the precise semiconductive final products of this invention is achieved at a commercially acceptable rate. From the above, it can be seen that there has been provided a simple and inexpensive process for forming compound semiconductive films of narrowly defined composition.
