# INTEGRAL OPTICAL DEVICE AND METHOD FOR PRODUCING OPTICAL PATTERN IN GLASS

## Abstract
An integral optical device composed of a porous glass body having an optical pattern formed in one or more selected zones of the body by photolysis of an organometallic com pound in the pores of those zones, characterised in that the po rous glass is impregnated with a polymerizable, organo func tional silicone fluid that is substantially polymerized only in the one or more zones forming the optical pattern is disclosed. A method of producing such an optical device comprising a porous glass body with a photolyzable organometallic com pound exposing the impregnated body to a source of photo lyzing radiation that is patterned selectively to expose certain portions of the body and at least partially photolytically to con vert the organometallic compound in those portions to photo lyzed intermediates that are stable in the glass and removing that portion of the organometallic compound which is not photolytically converted in the unexposed zones to leave a po rous glass matrix surrounding the patterned zones character ised in that the optionally patterned, porous glass body is fully impregnated with a polymerizable, organo functional silicone fluid and then the fluid in the patterned zones is substantially polymerized while the fluid in the porous matrix glass is main tained essentially unpolymerized is also disclosed. More generally, there is disclosed an improved integral op tical device of the type produced by creating optical patterns in porous glass bodies, especially patterns involving gradient refractive index distributions. The optical strength of an el ement, such as a lens, in such an optical pattern is increased by treatment with a polymerizable organo functional silicone fluid while the matrix glass is sealed.
