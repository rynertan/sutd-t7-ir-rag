# POWER STEERING GEAR FOR A VEHICLE

## Abstract
Seal wear of a hydraulic power steering gear housing 12 is reduced by the formation of discrete texturized hardened friction bands 90 of the initially smooth wall of a cylindrical bore 14 in the housing, to force relative rotary motion to occur, during operation, between the seal 84 and a control valve element 64 on which the seal is mounted, the material of the valve element being typically more wear resistant than the material of the housing.
