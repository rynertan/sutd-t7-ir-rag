# Arbor guiding apparatus.

## Abstract
An arbor guiding apparatus is disclosed. It has a plurality of arbors R, R arranged at least in two rotary rows and in tandem on a rotary packing drum A with respect to its axial direction. It also has a guiding device of the arbors in the radial direction. The guiding device includes supporting members 161, 161 axially supporting the arbors as well as connecting rods 49, 49 . One of the connecting rods 49 include a threeway shaft 49b at its one end, one way of the shaft being for engagement with a cam follower 49c for guiding the arbor in the first rotary row while another way of the shaft being for engagement with a cam follower 49d for guiding the arbor in the second rotary row. It further includes a device for effecting a relative movement of the arbors in the first and second rotary rows. The relative movement device includes a pinion 173 interposed between racks 172, 172 .
