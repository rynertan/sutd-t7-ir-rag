## Description
DIAMINOPYRIDINES VIA HYDROGENATION OF NITROBENZYLAMINOPYRIDINES The present invention relates to a process for preparing a diaminopyridine of the formulaEMI1.1 or a salt thereof, wherein R1 is hydrogen or C1 C4 alkyl and one of X and Z is CH and the other is N, comprising reacting a nitrobenzylaminopyridine of the formulaEMI1.2 or a salt thereof, with hydrogen in the presence of a catalytically sufficient amount of a palladium catalyst and a suitable solvent at a temperature in the range of from about 500C to about 1500C. Temperature will be expressed herein as degrees Celsius. In the above formula, C1 C4 alkyl represents a straight or branched alkyl chain having from one to four carbon atoms. Typical C1 C4 alkyl groups include methyl, ethyl, n propyl, isopropyl, n butyl, isobutyl, sec butyl and t butyl. Typical salts comprehended herein include the acid addition salts, such as hydriodic, hydrobromic and especially hydrochloric acid salts. While the entire scope of process variables taught herein are believed operable, the present process does have preferred aspects. In the above formula, preferably R1 is. hydrogen and X is N and Z is CR. Other preferred process conditions will be noted hereinafter. The process of the present invention is generally conducted as follows. Approximately one equivalent of the nitrobenzylaainopyridine is dissolved in a suitable solvent such as any one of the several alcohols, for example, methanol or preferably ethanol the saturated hydrocarbons, such as pentane or hexane the aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene or the xylenes the ethers, such as diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran and other similar non reactive organic solvents. Of these, the alcohols are preferred. The amount of solvent employed herein is not critical, but typically a quantity sufficient to dissolve the nitro benzylaminopyridine starting material and expected product is employed. Mixtures of solvents may be used as well. The nitrobenzylaminopyridine solution is then combined with a catalytically sufficient amount of a palladium catalyst. The term catalytically sufficient amount , as defined herein, refers to an amount of palladium catalyst which modifies, and especially increases, the rate of the chemical reaction without being consumed in the process. This amount will generally be from about 0.1 to 1.5 equivalents ofpalladium catalyst by weight to weight of starting nitrobenzylaminopyridine, more preferably at a weight equal to the weight of the starting material. Exemplary palladium catalysts for use herein include palladium oxide, palladium on calcium carbonate and especially palladium on carbon. The reaction is conducted in the presence of hydrogen gas and is typically carried out until the theoretical amount of four equivalents of hydrogen uptake is observed. The reaction is conducted at a temperature in the range of from about 500C to about 1500C, more preferably from about 500C to about 1000C, typically for a period of time in the range of 4 to 48 hours. The diaminopyridine thus prepared may be isolated by procedures well known in the art. Typically the reaction mixture is filtered through Celite and the filtrate is evaporated to dryness under reduced pressureThe product thus isolated may be further purified if desired by standard procedures such as crystallization from common solvents or purification over solid supports such as silica gel or alumina. The present process has been found to produce large quantities of either 2,3 or 3,4 diaminopyridines in high yields and to provide the product consistently in high purity, so that the compound may be used in the preparation of biologically active compounds without additional expensive purification steps. The diaminopyridine compounds prepared by the present process are preferably used as intermediates in the synthesis of a variety of compounds, for example pharmaceuticals useful for the treatment of a variety of human disorders. See, e.g. U.S. Patent Nos. 3,985,891 and 4,327,100 use of 2,3 diaminopyridine in the preparation of imidazo 4,5 b pyridine inotropic agents andEuropean Patent Application 72,926 use of 3,4 diaminopyridine in the preparation of imidazo 4,5 c pyridine inotropic agents . The reader is also referred to U.S.Patent No. 4,386,095, which teaches the use of diaminopyridines to ameliorate decreased cognition occurring in ageing canals. The nitrobenzylaminopyridine starting materials employed in the present process are prepared by procedures well known in the art, or by processes analogous to such prior art procedures. Generally, either a nitrochloropyridine or C1 C4 alkoxynitropyridine derivative is reacted with benzylamine under standard amination conditions. See, e.q.

Example 1 3,4 Diaminopyridine A mixture of 5.7 g 0.025 mol. of 3 nitro4 benzylaminopyridine, 5.7 g of 5 percent palladium on carbon in 90 ml of ethanol was hydrogenated at 800C for 30 hours at an initial pressure of 60 psi. The reaction mixture was filtered through Celite and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was crystallized from ethyl acetate methanol to afford 2.07 g of 3,4 diaminopyridine. Yield 76 . mp 1990 2010C. Example 2 2,3 Diaminopyridine A mixture. of 4.6 g 0.02 mol of 3 nitro 2benzylaminopyridine and 4.6 g of 5 percent palladium on carbon in 90 ml of ethanol was hydrogenated at 700 800C for approximately 16 hours art an initial pressure of 60 psi. The reaction mixture was filtered through Celite and the filtrate was evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure. The residue was crystallized from ethyl acetate to afford 2,3 diaminopyridine. mp 1120 1140C. m e 109.
