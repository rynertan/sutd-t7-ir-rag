# METHOD OF AND APPARATUS FOR LOW NOISE CURRENT AMPLIFICATION

## Abstract
This disclosure is concerned with novel techniques and circuit configurations for rendering high gain operational amplifiers and related differencing amplifiers adaptable for use with very low impedance signal sources to permit amplification of low power signals with ultra low noise, high D.C. stability, high gain, and wide frequency response, through development of the signal current as a very small increment on a much larger pre existing current forced in opposite directions through an electronic switching device connected to such amplifier and producing minimal uncorre lated noise therein.
