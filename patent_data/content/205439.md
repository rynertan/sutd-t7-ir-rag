## Description
The present invention relates to the control of electrothermal processes, and more specifically to those processes in which heat is generated by passing an electric current through a plurality of electrodes into and through a resistance medium in which the electrodes are placed. The invention can be applied to particular advantage in electric reduction furnaces in which the resistance medium comprises the furness charge or burden. It is emphasized, however, that the invention can also be applied when carrying out other electrothermal processes based on resistance heat, including arc heat. For example, appropriate parts of the invention can also be utilized in electric steel furnaces. However, since the advantages afforded by the invention are particularly large in number and most pronounced when applying the invention to processes carried out in reduction furnaces, particular reference will be made to such a furnace, and then especially to a three phase furnace, often used in practice, in which the electric current normally passes through one or more electrodes and thereupon through the furnace charge and finally through the metal bath lying therebeneath. In principle, however, the invention can also be applied irrespective of whether the current takes this path or travels totally or partially between the electrodes. In order to effect a satisfactory process in electro metallurgical furnaces and to satisfactorily utilize their electric capacity, it is a fundamental condition that the resistance factors of the furnace and of the electrode circuits are mastered. This applies both when the process heat is generated totally or partially by direct resistance heating of the charge, as with reduction and slag smelting furnaces, and when the heat is generated totally or partially by arcs, as with steel furnaces. The composition of the charge and its conductivity interplay with internal processes e.g. varying SiO formations and with purely electrical conditions, resulting in changes in the positions of the electrodes and in displacement of the electrical zero point in the furnace. Thus, the ability of the furnace to function is predominantly dependent on the ability to measure, monitor and consciously control the resistance conditions of the electrodes. Normally, endeavours are made to achieve this control by adjusting the height of the electrode tips in the furnace charge with the aid of automatic regulators. The electrical resistances are both electrically and metallurgically dependent. Optimum furnace performance therefore presumes contemporary electrical and metallurgical stability. It is imperative that a metallurgical balance prevails, if the electrical capacity of the furnace is to be utilized to the full. The mutual relationships of the electrical circuits and the position and stability of the electric zero point are also of special importance. Consequently, with respect to electrode control it is particularly important to be able to use control magnitudes which correctly reflect the electrical resistance conditions. Attempts have been made previously to control the electrodes with the aid of various control magnitudes In a number of processes involving a highly conductive metal bath e.g. pig iron , where the zero point is in all probability practically anchored within the bath, it has been possible passably to consider the furnace as three single phase furnaces connected in parallel. In such cases it has been endeavoured to place a measuring zero at the bottom of the furnace, which is then considered to coincide relatively closely to the true zero point of the system. By measuring phase voltage and phase current of respective electrodes directly with respect to the bottom zero point there are obtained approximatively usable auxiliary values of the resistance of the crater zones, when the remaining furnace running conditions are carefully upheld. This procedure is not practicable, however, in other highly important processes high percentage Si alloys, slag smelting etc. . The nature of the furnace as a three phase furnace as distinct to three parallel single furnaces appears clearly in these cases. The zero point is by no means reliably anchored, but is able to wander readily in relation to the electrode tips, so called fluttering zero point . As with the aforementioned dancing electrodes this often results in highly instable electrode positions and resistance values. In those cases when a rotating furnace body is used, there is also the purely constructional problem of incorporating a measurement zero point in the furnace structure. It can thus be said that the inability to discern and to render more precise, in a measurement technical fashion, those furnace parameters which, inter alia, are necessary in order to enable control of the electrodes to be effected in a satisfactory manner, has hitherto constituted a significant problem in the art with respect to the practical performance of the process. The object of the present invention is to eliminate the aforesaid problems and to provide to this end a method which enables current distribution in processes of the kind envisaged here to be stabilized and controlled, and which provides conditions for effecting the process in an optimum fashion, both from an electrical point of view and from a metallurgical point of view. This object is realized by the method according to the invention having the features set forth in the following claims. The method according to the invention thus comprises placing a plurality, preferably three, electrodes in a resistive medium applying an alternating current to the electrodes so as to heat the resistive medium as the result of current passing therethrough, said electrodes forming three current supplied net junction points R, S, T with the load in a delta configuration making electrical measurements and based theron calculating star load impedances of the electrodes and selectively adjusting the positions of the electrodes in the resistive medium in response to the calculated load impedances, thereby adjusting the electrical zero point of the load in accordance with predetermined, preferably equal mutual relationships between the star load impedances of the load. The method according to the invention is essentially characterized by calculating from current and voltage values in said measurements first values Z The relationships set shall be mutually the same particularly in the case of a symmetric electrode configuration. According to the invention the impedance auxiliary values are calculated advantageously by calculating the first impedance values Z It is emphasized that although impedances are complex magnitudes we are able here to utilize the value of respective magnitudes. Thus, instead of basing the measurements on a more or less unreliable measurement zero as a reference point , the total load on the furnace is treated in accordance with the invention as an equivalent star connected or Y connected impedance group which per se corresponds to the nature of the furnace. The true electric zero point of the furnace is therewith the reference point, and the resistances in the impedances of the star group may be considered natural characteristics of the process metallurgical conditions at each electrode. Respective reactances will normally be substantially the same, at least in the case of a symmetrical configuration. It is emphasized that the aforesaid first impedance values and delta network impedances i.e. the impedance auxiliary values can be measured and calculated with the aid of fixed measuring points, which are often already present in older installations and which can be established very readily in new installations and in a simple way as to the rest totally independently of any synthetic measurement zero and without any trouble, even in the case of a rotating furnace body. Star network impedances i.e. said impedance auxiliary values can be calculated on line, for example with the aid of conventional data equipment, and the calculation results can be presented directly in ditigal form, or with the aid of indicating instruments or data display screen, and used for automatic electrode control. When the network junction points R, S, T are connected to transformer secondary windings in a delta coupling, it has been found possible to base the aforesaid first impedance values quite simply on a delta network current value I In a further simplified method according to the invention delta network approximative current values I As will be understood, if a greater degree of accuracy is desired respective associated voltage values, preferably the delta network voltage values U It will also be understood that it is possible to effect total delta star transformation, the aforesaid auxiliary values being obtained by dividing each of the values obtained in the aforesaid pairwise multiplications with a factor corresponding to the denominator in the delta star transformation formula. It is emphasized that even though control in accordance with the invention is effected with the aid of the auxiliary or approximative values, which may be encumbered initially with appreciable errors, the accuracy will increase progressively as the electrical zero point stabilizes. Thus, the control advantageously has the character of a repeated process which ultimately provides a fully balanced and stabilized condition, where the auxiliary or approximative values reflect the desired values extremely well. By utilizing calculated star network impedances i.e. said impedance auxiliary values for electrode control, there is obtained a preliminary stabilization of the electrical zero point. In the case of symmetrical electrode configuration symmetrical furnace the positions of the electrodes normally their height positions are thus adjusted so that calculated star network impedances become mutually identical and suitably also numerically adapted to empirical values suitable for furnace operation. In the case of asymmetric electrode configuration or furnace, the electrodes are adjusted so that calculated star network impedances have constant predetermined mutually relationships. In conjunction with the aforesaid preliminary stabilization of the electric zero point, the furnace has been brought to a preliminary electrical balance, i.e. both the electrical zero point and the individual electrode positions have been preliminarily stabilized in conformity with the conductivity conditions prevailing at that moment in time in respective electrode zones. The electrode tips, however, will be located at different height levels in the furnace charge or burden as mutual differences occur between the conductivity of the electrode zones. In order to obtain a final stabilization with full electric balance and metallurgical balance sought for, it is now possible in accordance with the invention to equalize the positions of the electrodes in the charge or burden, i.e. to ensure that the electrode tips have mutually the same height positions. This is effected by selectively adjusting while maintaining the preliminary stabilization the input composition of the resistive medium, and therewith its conductivity at respective electrodes, and or by applying a special material directly to the upper surface of the charge or burden in the vicinity of respective electrodes. In this regard an increase in conductivity will elevate the position of the electrode and vice versa, with remaining conditions unchanged. Subsequent to this final stabilization, the electrodes are able to function as a well coordinated and mutually balanced unit. This unit can now be brought to a working position, which suitably can be determined empirically for a given furnace and a given starting material. In the case of a fully symmetrical configuration, the aforesaid final stabilization can be expected to correspond to identical and stable resistances R of the star network impedances Z . It is emphasized that as the height positions of the electrode tips are gradually equalized, the risk of undesirable current paths appearing between the electrodes and causing changes in the metallurgical performance, e.g. increased SiO formation in connection with Si reductions, decreases. When adjusting the conductivity for the purpose of achieving the aforesaid final stabilization, it is possible to derive instructive guidance in various ways. In accordance with one preferred method of the invention there is used in this respect a so called derivative method c.f. for example SE B 315 057 or US PS 3,375,318 to which reference is made here and the contents of which shall herewith be considered to be taken up in the present text to determine a comparison value for respective electrodes corresponding to the relationship between the star network impedance Z of the electrode and the derivative dZ dh of the star network impedance Z with respect to the position h of the electrode tip. The thus determined comparison values are utilized as those values on which said adjustment is based. Such comparison values will provide good, more direct indication of the height positions of the electrode tips and therewith the necessary material additives for achieving the aforesaid final stabilization. It will be understood that in practice the aforementioned impedance auxiliary value is used as the star network impedance value. The determined comparison value will be representative, due to having achieved the preliminary stabilization. As is more clearly disclosed in the aforesaid SE B 315 057, the derivative method involves measuring said derivative upon a slight cyclic change in the height position of respective electrodes. In processes in which molten material is tapped off intermittently, where the height of an electrically conductive layer is changed between tapping occasions, measurements of the aforesaid derivative are suitably carried out at a point in time at which the greatest difference in the impedance value is obtained for a small change in the height position of the electrode tips. Stabilization in accordance with the invention also enables, often in a simple fashion, a star network resistance value for a respective electrode star network junction to be measured relative to a suitably selected, accessible constructed zero point measurement zero , which while observing the electrode configuration and the setting of the electrical zero point of the load through the preliminary stabilization can be expected to correspond to the latter. Adjustments can then be carried out, beginning from such measured star network resistance values. The constructed zero point may suitably be located in the conductive bottom of the furnace, above which bottom there is located a layer of molten material, which often exhibits good electric conductivity. When the furnace bottom and furnace walls include electrically conductive material, it is possible in many instances to place the constructed zero point almost anywhere on the furnace bottom or the furnace walls. This enables reliable, measured star network resistance values of the aforesaid kind to be obtained in an extremely simple fashion while using simple conventional measuring equipment. The invention will now be described in more detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. Figure 1 is a schematic circuit diagram of a symmetric three phase furnace operating with three electrodes, the electrode load being indicated by its corresponding delta network impedances. Figure 2 is a diagram similar to that of Figure 1, but with the electrode load indicated by its assumed equivalent star network impedances in accordance with the invention. Figure 3 is a schematic circuit diagram of substantially the same kind as that illustrated in Figures 1 and 2, showing the connection of the transformers used to the mains and two alternative measurement connections. Figure 4 is a diagram illustrating the principle relationship between the star network impedance Z of an electrode and the height position The arrangement illustrated in Fig. 1 relates to symmetric three phase furnace, which may be a reduction furnace, an alloying furnace, a slag smelting furnace or a steel furnace, for instance, and in which three electrodes R, S and T are vertically submerged into the burden not shown charged to the furnace container. The electrodes are symmetrically arranged, so as to be located in respective corners of an equilateral triangle. The electrodes are supplied with current through three single phase transformers, the primary sides of which are connected to a conventional three phase network. The secondary side of the transformer T In Fig. 1 the load on the electrodes R, S, T are indicated by corresponding delta network impedances In the Fig. 2 embodiment these delta network impedances have been replaced by the equivalent star network or Y impedances These equivalent impedances, which will be unequal, are used in the preliminary stabilizing process as control magnitudes for electrode control, so as to change the height positions of the electrodes to render the impedances equal and thereafter to maintain the impedances mutually equal. The impedances in the above relationship are complex magnitudes, which complicate the calculations. According to the invention, however, it is possible to work with the impedance values with good approximation. In addition, when taking into consideration the fact that the denominators in the above expression can be assumed to be at least approximately equal there is then obtained Thus, the three products Z Fig. 3 illustrates the three transformers T According to the first, and particularly simple method there are used three conventional current transformers 31, 33 and 35 for measuring respective incoming phase currents I According to the other method both current and voltage on the primary side of respective transformers are measured with the aid of a conventional current transformer 43 and a conventional voltage transformer 45. These are connected in a conventional manner to an ammeter or current meter 47, an active power meter 49 and a reactive power meter 51, all of which are of conventional design. With the aid of the relationship Thus, such an impedance value is calculated for each of the transformers T The currents through the equivalent impedances, i.e. the currents phase currents The voltages As beforementioned, however, it is possible in many instances due to the preliminary stabilization to replace the electrical zero point 13 with a constructed measurement zero, for example, in the furnace bottom. In this way, the phase voltages U Subsequent to effecting the aforesaid preliminary stabilization, the electrode tips may have mutually different height levels, even though the phase resistances have been brought to mutually different values. This is due to metallurgically conditional dissimilarities between the conductivity of the crater zones. The dissimilarities are normally caused by varying carbon strength within the burden. In order to accomplish a perfect furnace run it is necessary to equalize the conductivities and therewith the electrode positions. In accordance with the invention it is advantageous to use the aforesaid so called derivative method for determining for respective electrodes a derivative value dZ dh, i.e. the derivative of the impedance Z with respect to the height position Fig. 4 illustrates principally a typical relationship for an electrode between on the one hand impedance Z and height positions The values on the upper leg of the curve Z dh dZ have thus been found to give relative values of the highest power with which the electrode in question can be loaded without the highest energy density prevailing in the furnace adjacent respective electrode tips so called electrode tip power becoming excessively great so as to result in overheating of parts of the furnace burden, causing premature slag formation accompanied by pressure blow outs, hanging and possibly explosions as a result. The turning point 21 of the curve, i.e. the maximum value for Z dh dZ, corresponds to the highest power take up ability of the furnace charge and therewith the electrode position affording maximum furnace production. Subsequent to final stabilization the assembled electrode bunch may consequently, if desired, be adjusted to an optimum electrode position, by controlled change of the set point values of the electrode regulators i.e. impedance value on the basis of the measured values of the function Z dh dZ. The aforesaid electrode tip power corresponds to the expression I² dZ dh and can thus be monitored, when the so called derivative method is used. In the case of continuous processes in which the material sinks slowly and uniformly down through the furnace, the electrode tip power has an intimate relationship with the local process temperature adjacent the electrode tip, and can therefore be used as an auxiliary value for monitoring the stability of the temperature and possible variations. Thus, particularly when there is not available a reliable constructed measuring zero which enables the star network resistance to be determined, it is possible to utilize for the final stabilization the so called derivative method for obtaining the function values Z dh dZ for respective electrodes, and using these values as a basis for adjusting conductivity and setting the electrodes in the best position. As a result of the primary stabilization, these function values may often be considered to have good correspondence with the function values R dh dR . It is emphasized that the height position
