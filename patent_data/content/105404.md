## Description
TITLE OF THE INVENTIONDerivatives of steroid compounds linked to cyotoxic agents and process for their preparationBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION It is known that low density lipoprotein LDL particles are important factors in the regulation of plasma cholesterol. The cholesterol is transmitted as either of two types of liquids 1 triglycerides of cholesterol or 2 long chain fatty acid esters of cholesterol. The LDL particles are small blood borne lipid encased spheres which ordinarily contain a cholesterol ester as a hydrophobic core. The surface of the LDL particles is composed of certain phospholipids, free cholesterol and apoproteins which direct the particle to the site of metabolism Regulation of PlasmaCholesterol by Lipoprotein Receptors, Brown et al.,Science, Vol. 212, p. 628,, 8 May 1981. It is also known prior to the present invention that LDL particles cm be broken open to remove the contents and then reconstituted with different materials incorporated into the core of theLDL particles. This reconstitution with different core material does not always provide stable LDL particles but in some instances provides LDL particles which give up the core material before arriving at the intended site. In an ideal situation, the reconstituted LDL particles incorporating the desired material are targeted to the cells and taken up by the cells by endocytosis whereupon the core material is released into the target cell. In this connection, certain cancer cells have extremely high requirements for LDL compared to normal body cells. One of the objects of the present invention is to provide new compounds which are effective as cytotoxic agents for tumor cells, especially for cells which cause myelogenous leukemia. Another object is to provide compounds which are readily incorporated into the core of LDL particles and which are stable until incorporated into the target cells. A still further object is the provision of non toxic derivative of a steroid compound and a cytotoxic agent which is readily hydrolyzed intracellularly thereby providing a killing dose of the cytotoxic agent within the target cells. These and other objects are accomplished by applicants discovery which is described in greater detail hereinbelow. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to compounds which are steroid derivatives of cytotoxic agents wherein said steroids have the basic carbon skeleton of androstene, esterified at the 3 hydroxy position by a long chain 12 20 carbons unsaturated fatty acid and having a 17 side chain consisting of an alkyl carbamoyl radical linked through an amido nitrogen to a cytotoxic substance such as a nitrogen mustard compound. More particularly, the present invention relates to steroid esters of the formula EMI3.1 whereinR1 is an unsaturated aliphatic carbonyloxyl radical of from 12 20 carbons n is an integer of from 1 10A is a bivalent linking radical selected from a EMI3.2 wherein R4 is H, lower alkyl, phenyl or heteroaryl.b EMI3.3 c EMI4.1 d EMI4.2 andB is a radical derived from a cytotoxic substance linked through an amino substituent wherein said cytotoxic substance is selected from, uracil mustard, 6 mercaptopurine, thioguanine, adriamycin, procarbazine, nitromycin and bis 2 chloroethyl amine. Still more specifically the invention comprises 3 oleyl eters of 3 hydroxy 5 androstenes having a 17 position side chain comprising a 2 pentyl radical linked through a carbamate linkage to a cytotoxic agent. The nitrogen atom of the carbamate linkage can form part of the cytotoxic moiety of applicants novel steroid compounds. Thus, for example, a preferred compound of applicants invention is 2 3ss oleoyloxy androst 5 enyl 1713 propyloxycarbonyl bis 2chloroethyl amine of the formula EMI4.3 It has been found that these compounds of applicants invention can be incorporated into LDL particles replacing cholesterol esters naturally present in the core of the LDL particles using known procedures as set forth in the published literature Replacement of Endogenous Cholesteryl Esters of LowDensity Lipoprotein With Endogenous CholesterylLinoleate, Krieger, M., M. S. Brown, J. R. Faust andJ. L. Goldstein 1978 Reconstitution of aBiologically Active Lipoprotein Particle, J. Biol.Chem. 253 4093 4141, Krieger, M., M. J. McPhaul,J. L. Goldstein, and M. S. Brown 1979 Replacement of Neutral Lipids of Low Density Lipoprotein WithEsters of Long Chain Unsaturated Fatty Acids, J.Biol. Chem., 254 3845 3853. The reconstitution procedure whereby applicants novel compounds can be incorporated intoLDL particles for delivery to tumor cells having high requirement for LDL particles involves several steps. The LDL solution is first dialyzed under sterile conditions to remove undesirable low molecular weight impurities. The LDL material diluted with water is then frozen and lyophilized to open the LDL particle and release the cholesterol esters contained therein. The resulting lyophilized material is then extracted with heptane to remove a substantial amount of cholesteryl esters and leave the remainder of the LDL particles as a residue. An appropriate amount of one of applicants compounds dissolved in heptane is then added to the LDL residue and the mixture incubated for approximately 1 hour at 100C.The heptane is removed from the mixture and the residue diluted with buffers and incubated for several hours at 40C to produce reconstituted LDL particles wherein applicants compound is incorporated into the core of the LDL particles. At this stage the reconstituted LDL particles are suspended in the aqueous buffer solution and are separated by centrifugation leaving the LDL particles as a semisolid pellet from which the supernatant buffer solution may be removed by aspiration. the semisolid pellet of reconstituted LDL may then be formulated into pharmaceutical composition suitable for parenteral administration. The compounds of the present invention are prepared by reaction of a steroid compound of the formula EMI6.1 wherein R1 and n are defined as hereinabove and a cytotoxic agent containing an amine group to produce a compound of the formula EMI7.1 wherein R1, n and B are as defined hereinabove. Examples of compounds within the scope of applicants invention include 3 ss oleoyl, 3ss linoleoyl and 3ss linolenoyl esters of 3ss hydroxy 5 androstene compounds having a 17 side chain comprising a 2 alkyloxycarbonyl substituent linked to an amino substituent of a cytotoxic compound. Especially preferred compounds of the present invention are 2 3ss oleoyloxy androst 5 ene 17ss yl propyloxycarbonyl bis 2 chloroethyl amine 4 3ss oleoyloxy androst 5 en 17ss yl pentyloxyCarbonyl bis 2 chloroethyl amine. Other compounds included within the scope of the present invention are corresponding derivatives of the above steriod esters in which the bis 2 chloroethyl amine substituent is replaced by another cytotoxic substance selected from fluorouracil of the structure EMI7.2 uracil mustard, 6 mercaptopurine, or thioguanine. The compounds of applicants invention are useful in the selective killing of cancer cells in vivo or in vitro when incorporated into the core ofLDL particles which are selectively absorbed by cancer cells via endocytosis and the cytotoxic substance released by intracellular hydrolysis. The present invention comprises novel cytotoxic compositions useful in the selective killing of certain specific cells such as those causing acute myelogenous leukemia. These novel compositions include a pharmaceutical carrier for intravenous administration and a therapeutically effective amount of a steriod ester of the formula EMI8.1 wherein R1, n, A and B are as defined as in FormulaI hereinabove, said steroid ester being incorporated into the core of reconstituted LDL particles. More specifically the present invention comprises pharmaceutical compositions intended for use in the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia comprising a pharmaceutical carrier for intravenous administration, e.g. sterile distilled water or a sterile aqueous pharmaceutically acceptable, nontoxic buffer solution and a therapeutically effective amount, i.e. from 0.1 1.0 g of reconstituted LDL particles patient day containing as the active core ingredient approximately 20 40 , preferably 33 , by weight of a steriod of the formula EMI9.1 wherein R represents a ss lineoyloxy radical ss oleoyloxy radical, or ss linolenoyloxy radical. Still more specifically the present invention includes pharmaceutical compositions comprising a pharmaceutical carrier for intravenous administration and from 3 to 6 mg kg of 4 3ss oleoyloxy androst 5 en 17ss yl pentyloxycarbonyl bis 2 chloroethylamine .
