# Optical rotary encoder.

## Abstract
An optical rotary encoder includes a slit plate having a plurality of circumferentially aligned slits of a pitch P, a light emitting diode, and a light responsive section. The light responsive section includes four photodiodes formed on a single substrate. The four photodiodes are aligned in the tangential direction of the slit plate with the interval corres ponding to 1 4 P. Output signals derived from each of the four photodiodes are introduced into a detection circuit for determining the angular position and velocity of a rotating shaft to which the slit plate is secured.
