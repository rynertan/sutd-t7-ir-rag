# Indexable cutting insert.

## Abstract
An indexable cutting insert 10 for a tool 18 adapted to cut internal right angled corners in a work piece 19 . The insert 10 has a square configuration and comprises a top major surface 11 , a bottom major surface 12 and connect ing side surfaces 13 . The lines of junction between the top major surface and the side surfaces define the main cutting edges 14 and the minor cutting edges 15 . The main cutting edges 14 transite into the second cutting edges 15 in the corners of the insert. Each second cutting edge 15D projects from the square basical shape so that it will lift the inactive main cutting edge 14A from the machined surface under the insert.
