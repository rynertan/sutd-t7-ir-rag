# LAMINATED PAPERBOARD CONTAINER WITH ABSORPTION RESISTANCE MEANS, AND BLANK FOR CONSTRUCTING SAME

## Abstract
The drawings and description disclose a heat sealable container for edible oils and other types of oils, and a blank for constructing same, having a laminated wall construction of suitable oil resistant barriers or layers which are compatible with one another insofar as bonding and sealing are con cerned. Such wall construction includes central layers of aluminium foil and fluorochemically treated paperboard sec ured to one another by a suitable adhesive, an ionomer layer, such as surlyn, formed on each outer paperboard and foil surface, and a layer of thermoplastic material, such as polyethylene, formed on each outer surlyn surface. As an alternate embodiment in some applications, the surlyn layer may be omitted from the foil surface, and the outer layer of thermoplastic material may be applied directly to the foil surface.
