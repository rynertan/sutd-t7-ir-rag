# Electron beam projection system.

## Abstract
The electron beam projection system includes means for producing an electron beam, means 43, 45 for deflecting the beam 39 , a magnetic projection lens 33 having rotational symmetry for focusing the deflected beam and a pair of magnetic compensation yokes 55, 57 positioned within the bore of the projection lens means 33 . The pair of compensation yokes 55, 57 has coil dimensions such that, in combination, they produce a magnetic compensation field proportional to the first derivative of the axial magnetic field strength distribution curve of the projection lens 33 . Upon application of current to the pair of compensation yokes 55, 57 the electron optical axis of the projection lens 33 shifts to the position of the deflected beam so that the electron beam 39 remains coincident with the shifted electron optical axis and lands perpendicular to a target 59 .
