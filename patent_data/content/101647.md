# Molded tray for display stands.

## Abstract
An improved molded tray for a display stand is shaped to provide a rectangular planar product support member, whose support area is free of structural invasion by other parts of the tray. The planar product support member is reinforced by an in tegral, transverse, peripheral reinforcing flange that extends vertically along the periphery of the support member. Integral, tubular corner post receiving means are provided adjacent each corner of the support member and tangent to the peri pheral flange. Reinforcing strips extend parallel to and out wardly of the reinforcing flange to two opposed sides of the tray, and are integral with the tubular post receiving means. A horizontal top wall joins the upper edges of the peripheral flange and each parallel reinforcing strip. The underside of the planar support member is reinforced by a grid of orthogonal ribs, and the support member is apertured, between the rein forcing ribs to reduce the amount of plastic used in forming the tray. The corner post receiving means provides an upper, re duced height, stud concentric with a sleeve for cooperation with a tubular post, and a lower, extended length stud, concen tric with a short sleeve for cooperation with a tubular post. The lower extended stud length provides versatile usage.
