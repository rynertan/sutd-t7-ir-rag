## Description
SPRAY CAP AND BOTTLE ENGAGEMENT METHOD AND APPARATUS Field of the Invention The present invention relates generally to methods and apparatus for interconnecting bottles and bottle caps, and more particularly to techniques for engaging spray bottles and spray bottle caps wherein the caps can be axially snapped on and selectively rotationally removed and replaced to allow for refilling of the bottle. Background of the Invention There are many known ways to attach bottle caps to bottles. Standard threaded connections, for example, are very commonly employed. Spray bottles have been found to be particularly useful for dispensing various household cleaning products, and the present invention is particularly directed to a new technique for attaching a sprayer cap to a bottle A spray bottle is defined herein as having two major components a bottle suitable for holding a liquid and a sprayer suitable for engaging the bottle and delivering the liquid in the form of a mist, spray or stream. In the past, the sprayer was typically mounted atop the bottle through the use of a standard threaded connection. In this case, the neck portion of the bottle has external threads and a cap operatively connected to the sprayer has mating internal threads.The cap is typically outwardly concentric with the sprayer and engages a lip on the sprayer to draw it into sealing engagement with the neck of the bottle. Typically, though not necessarily, the sprayer has a sprayer body, pivotally mounted handle, piston and other moving parts, and a dip tube which is suitable for immersion in the liquid contained within the bottle. When the handle is activated, the piston within the sprayer creates a vacuum in the dip tube, thus drawing the liquid up into the body of the sprayer and forcing the liquid through a nozzle. In many cases, it is important that there be a good seal between the sprayer and the bottle. Although the sprayer will typically function in the absence of such a seal, it is desirable to avoid leakage of the liquid from the spray bottle. Many household cleaning liquids are sufficiently acidic or alkaline to create an annoyance if not a hazard should they inadvertently leak out of the spray bottle. It is also preferable in many cases that the bottle be refillable. Manufacturers often are most interested in selling the liquid, not the spray bottle. Spray bottles are relatively expensive, particularly in view of the fact that the sprayers often include several moving parts, and cost conscious consumers do not want to purchase an expensive spray bottle every time they buy additional cleaning liquid. Preferably, the bottle can be refilled any number of times without damaging the bottle or sprayer and without detrimentally affecting the seal between the bottle and the sprayer. Also, preferably, the cap of the sprayer can be easily removed and replaced. If the removal or replacement of the cap bottle requires excessive force, it is swore likely that the oftentimes corrosive liquid will be spilled.It is perceived that the safest way to remove a cap from a bottle is to twist the cap off of the bottle. On the other hand, it is perceived that initial assembly of the spray bottle at the manufacturing plant would be more economical if the cap were axially 1snapped onto the bottle. Such an operation would be faster than screwing or twisting the sprayer s cap onto the neck of the bottle. Also, the production equipment for simply snapping the sprayer onto the bottle would be simpler and less expensive. It is generally recognized that complex motions such as twisting or the like should be avoided on an automated assembly line if at all possible. Prior art spray bottles possess several shortcomings in view of the criteria let out above. As noted above, the most common sprayer bottle connection scheme involves a threaded connection. An outwardly extending lip on the sprayer body is engaged by an internally threaded cap which is mateable with an externally threaded bottle neck.Although such a spray bottle readily permits refilling of the bottle, during initial assembly of the spray bottle the cap must be threaded into place, a relatively time consuming and expensive task. The present invention is directed to the shortcomings of the prior art. In particular, the present invention includes a technique for connecting a sprayer cap to a bottle wherein they can initially be axially snapped together and can subsequently be readily disassembled and assembled by twisting the cap relative to the bottle neck, thereby permitting bottle refilling. Summary of the Invention Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a bottle having a neck suitable for axially engaging a spray cap without substantial rotation of the cap relative to the neck. Preferably, the cap is simply snapped onto the bottle neck during the initial assembly thereof. The bottle neck of the present invention includes a first neck surface suitable for operatively engaging a first cap surface to substantially prevent the axial disengagement of the cap and the neck in the absence of rotation of the cap relative to the neck. The neck of the present invention also includes a second neck surface suitable for operatively engaging a second cap surface, wherein the second surfaces have a normal state wherein they interfere to substantially prevent rotation of the cap relative to the neck. Further, the second surfaces of the cap and neck have a second state wherein they can be freely rotationally moved relative to one another to accommodate rotation of the spray cap relative to the neck and axial disengagement of the cap from the bottle. This second state is selectable by manipulating the cap relative to the neck. The bottle neck preferably includes a pair of diametrally spaced upper bumpers and a pair of diametrally spaced lower bumpers, with one each of the upper bumpers pairing up with one each of the lower bumpers to form a pair of dog guides. A neck element extends from each upper bumper toward the corresponding lower bumper proximate the lower end of the corresponding dog guide, which is preferably approximately spirally shaped. And, each upper bumper terminates at its lower end with an upper bumper ramp. Each upper bumper ramp, corresponding neck element and the lower end of the corresponding lower bumper form a dog recess suitable for holding the cap dog under normal conditions. In one embodiment, the neck element only partially spans the dog guide so as to create a dog escape between the lower end of the neck element and the lower bumper.In a second embodiment, the neck element completely spans the dog guide so as to form a closed dog recess. When it is desired to remove the spray cap from the first embodiment of the bottle, the spray cap and the bottle are axially pushed toward each other to align the cap dogs with the dog escapes so that the spray cap can be freely rotationally moved and the cap dogs can travel up the corresponding dog guides so as to disengage the spray cap from the bottle. To remove the spray cap from the second embodiment from the bottle, however, the spray cap must be twisted so as to force the cap dogs over the neck elements and into the main portion of the dog guides. Once the cap dogs have overcome the resistance of the neck elements, the cap can be freely rotated and the cap dogs will freely traverse the dog guide so that the cap can be freely removed from the bottle.

Detailed Description of the Invention The following is a detailed description of preferred embodiments of the present invention and is intended to illustrate but not limit the invention. Referring to the drawing, wherein like reference numerals represent like parts throughout the several views, Figure 1 shows a perspective view of a spray bottle 10 of the present invention. The spray bottle 10 is of a type typically used for dispensing household cleaning liquids, and the following discussion will focus on this application of the invention. However, the present invention is not limited to the bottle configuration shown in Figure 1, nor is it limited to bottles which are suitable for dispensing liquid household cleaners. The spray bottle 10 includes a bottle 12 and a sprayer 14. Focusing on use of the invention for dispensing liquid household cleaners, bottle 12 is preferably plastic, e.g., high density polyethylene, and is preferably blow molded using conventional techniques.Bottle 12 preferably terminates with a bottle neck 13 at its upper end, the bottle neck 13 being suitable for engaging the sprayer 14 as further described below. The sprayer 14 sits atop bottle 12 on bottle neck 13 and is preferably substantially of a conventional type.The sprayer 14 includes a sprayer body 16 which supports the various moving parts of the sprayer 14. A handle 18 is preferably pivotally mounted to the sprayer body 16 so that when the handle 18 is depressed a piston not shown within the sprayer body 16 is operatively moved within a mating cylinder not shown to create a vacuum within the dip tube shown in Figure 2 of the sprayer 14. The sprayer 14 also includes a nozzle 20 which forms an orifice suitably sized and configured to mist, spray or otherwise direct the liquid as it issues from the nozzle 20. Finally, the sprayer 14 also includes a cap portion 22 at its lower end operatively connected to the sprayer body 16 for interconnecting the sprayer 14 and the bottle neck 13. Preferably, though not necessarily, the cap portion 22 is integral with the sprayer body 16. The sprayer 14 is preferably substantially comprised of injection molded plastic components with a preferred material being polypropylene. Generally, such sprayers are conventional and commercially available throughContico International, Inc., of St. Louis, Missouri. The cap portion 22 of the spray bottle 10 of the present invention is unique, however, as described below.Preferably, the cap portion 22 is molded with the sprayer body 16 such that the two portions of the sprayer 14 are integral. Alternatively, the cap portion 22 could be concentric and free spinning relative to the sprayer body 16. In that case, the cap portion 22 and sprayer body 16 would preferably be individually molded and later assembled. Generally, the bottle operates as follows when the handle 18 is manipulated a vacuum is produced in the depending dip tube shown in Figure 2 attached to the sprayer body 16. This vacuum in the dip tube in combination with atmospheric pressure on the upper surface of the liquid within the bottle cause the liquid to flow up the dip tube and into the sprayer body 16 where it is forced through the orifice of nozzle 20 according to conventional and well known principles. Figure 2 shows an enlarged exploded view of the cap portion 22 and the bottle neck 13. The cap portion 22 preferably includes a flexible cylindrical portion 24 extending downward from the sprayer body 16. The flexible cylindrical portion 24 is in the nature of a tube or cylindrical shell and is formed by a flexible cap side wall 26. The side wall 26 forms an axial opening which is in fluid communication with an opening not shown in the sprayer body 16. The cap side wall 26 also preferably forms a pair of transverse cap windows 28 to further increase the flexibility of the cylindrical portion 24. The cap side wall 26 also forms, toward its upper end, a valve case region 30 which is suitable for receiving a valve case 36 discussed below . The inner surface of the side wall 26 also preferably carries a pair of diametrally spaced cap dogs 30 which project radially inward and which are preferably integral with the cap side wall 26, having been formed during the injection molding process. The cap dogs 30 preferably each have a dog height 32 and a dog width 34 as shown inFigure 2. The function of the cap dogs 30 is further described below. As noted above, the cap portion 22 also includes a valve case 36, shown exploded away from the sprayer body 16 in Figure 2. The valve case 36 is also preferably injection molded plastic and fits into the valve case region 30 formed by the upper portion of cap side wall 26.An upper portion 38 of the valve case 36 is sized to be frictionally held by the correspondingly sized valve case region 30. The valve case 36 carries a vent tube not shown for communicating atmospheric pressure to the liquid within the bottle 12 according to a well known technique. The valve case 36 also includes a dip tube 42 which downwardly extends into the bottle 12 to pick up the liquid contained therein. The valve case 36 also includes a radially extending ring like liner lip 44 which is positioned immediately below the upper portion 38. The liner lip 44 includes a substantially horizontal and flat surface 46 which is suitable for being sealingly engaged by a compressible sealing member, discussed below. Finally, extending downwardly from the liner lip 44 is an apron 48. The apron 48 is a thin cylindrical shell or tube which surrounds the vent tube not shown and the dip tube 42. The outside diameter of apron 48 is less than the outside diameter of liner lip 44, as shown inFigure 2. The cap portion 22 also preferably includes a ringlike foamed liner 50, in the nature of an O ring. The foamed liner 50 preferably has an outside diameter substantially equal to the outside diameter of liner lip 44 and an inside diameter substantially equal to the outside diameter of apron 48. Thus, the apron 48 can be inserted through the center of the foamed liner 50 and the foamed liner 50 can be pressed into sealing engagement with the lower surface 46 of liner lip 44. The inner surface of liner 50 is frictionally held by the outer surface of apron 48 so that when the sprayer 14 is removed the liner 50 remains with it. Preferably, the foamed liner 50 is a foamed polyethylene or polyvinylchloride. Such foamed liners or rings are commercially available, Minnesota Mining andManufacturing, St. Paul, Minnesota, being one company offering such liners. The height 52 and the effective durometer of the liner 50 are chosen so that the cap portion 22 and bottle neck 13 will function together in the manner described below. Thus, the upper portion 38 of valve case 36 is held by valve case region 30 and liner 50 frictionally surrounds apron 48 immediately below liner lip 44 adjacent lower surface 46. Still referring to Figure 2, bottle neck 13, the uppermost portion of bottle 12, is primarily formed from a neck side wall 54 which has an inner diameter suitable for slidably receiving the apron 48 of valve case 36. The fit between these two parts is preferably an interference fit.The outside diameter of neck side wall 54 is substantially equal to the outside diameter of liner lip 44 and the uppermost surface of the neck side wall 54, a neck ridge 56, is configured to support the foamed liner 50 on its lowermost surface. Thus, when the cap portion 22 is operatively engaged with the bottle neck 13, the foamed liner 50 is compressed between the neck ridge 56 and the lower surface 46 of liner lip 44. Extending radially outward from the neck side wall 54 are upper bumpers 58 and lower bumpers 60. The bottle neck 13 preferably includes two sets of diametrally spaced bumpers 58 and 60 but only one set is shown for the sake of clarity. The bumpers 58 and 60 are spaced so as to form two regions in the bottle neck 13 corresponding to the two cap dogs 30 extending radially inward from the cap side wall 26 of cap portion 22. The outside diameters of bumpers 58 and 60 are substantially equal to the inside diameter of cap side wall 26 so that the cap side wall 26 will slidably fit over the bumpers 58 and 60. Each upper bumper 58 angles downward from the neck ridge 56 in a spiral fashion and terminates in an upper bumper ramp 62 which angles away and downward from the adjacent neck side wall 54. The upper bumper ramps 62 are diametrally spaced so as to correspond with the spacing of the cap dogs 30. The cap dogs 30 each include an inclined surface which is suitable for slidably interacting with the corresponding upper bumper ramp 62 when the cap portion 22 is axially snapped onto the bottle neck 13, as further described below. The lower bumper 60 is vertically spaced from the upper bumper 58 so as to form an approximately spiral dog guide 64. The dog guide 64 has a substantially cylindrical back wall formed by neck side wall 54. The distance between upper bumper 58 and lower bumper 60 is larger than the dog height 32 so as to freely allow the corregponding cap dog 30 to travel through the dog guide 64. The bumpers 58 and 60 serve to vertically constrain the corresponding cap dog 30 so as to appropriately guide it to either engage or disengage the cap portion 22 and the bottle neck 13 as further described below. The depth or radial dimension of each dog 30 is preferably slightly less than the difference between the bumper diameters and the diameter of the neck side wall 54 so that the dog 30 will freely pass through the corresponding dog guide 64. At the lower end of each dog guide 64 is a dog recess 66 formed at one end by a substantially vertical dog stop 68 joining the lower ends of corresponding bumpers 58 and 60 adjacent to and below the corresponding upper bumper ramp 62. Located counter clockwise relative to the dog stop 68 as the bottle neck 13 is viewed from above is a downwardly extending neck element 70. The neck element 70 is connected at its top end to the upper bumper 58 and the neck element 70 extends toward but does not connect to the lower bumper 60. The space between the lower end of neck element 70 and the lower bumper 60 forms a dog escape 71.The dog escape 71 has an escape height 72 which is larger than the dog height 32 of cap dog 30, for the reasons set out below. Figures 3 and 4 are fragmentary cross sectional views of the cap portion 22 operatively engaged with the bottle neck 13. Figure 3 illustrates the normal condition of the spray bottle 10 the seal 50 is only moderately compressed and each cap dog 30 is within the corresponding dog recess. 66 formed by the bottle neck 13. Counterclockwise rotation of the cap portion 22 relative to the bottle 12 to remove the cap 22 is prevented by the interference between the dogs 30 and the corresponding neck elements 70. Further, the sprayer 14 cannot simply be lifted off of the bottle 12 due to the interaction between the top surfaces of the dogs 30 and the bottom surfaces of the corresponding top bumpers 58 adjacent the dog recesses 66.Thus the sprayer 14 and bottle 12 are locked together, and the resilient seal 50 urges dogs 30 behind neck elements 70 and out of alignment with dog escapes 71 to maintain this locked state. When access to the interior of the bottle 12 is desired, e.g., to refill the bottle, the sprayer 14 can be removed by twisting it off of the bottle neck 13. First, however, the cap portion 22 must be depressed to further compress the seal 50 as shown in Figure 4. When the seal is sufficiently compressed, the dogs 30 will clear corresponding neck elements 70 and align with the corresponding dog escapes 71 to allow the cap portion 22 to be simply twisted off of the bottle neck 13. The dogs 30 travel substantially spirally up the dog guides 64 as the cap 22 is twisted in a counterclockwise direction, thus axially drawing the cap portion 22 away from the bottle neck 13. Once the dogs 30 are beyond the upper bumpers 58 the sprayer 14 can be freely lifted out of engagement with the bottle 12. The bottle 12 can then be refilled. After the bottle 12 has been refilled, the sprayer 14 can easily be twisted back into engagement with the bottle 12. The dogs 30 are aligned with the dog guides 64 and the cap 22 is twisted in the clockwise direction. This causes the dogs 30 to spiral down the guide 64 until they come into contact with the corresponding neck elements 70.At this point the cap portion 22 is again depressed to compress the liner 50, thus aligning the dogs 30 with the dog escapes 71. Further clockwise rotation of the cap portion 22 causes the dogs 30 to enter the dog recesses 66 where they are securely held once the seal 50 acts to spring the cap 22 away from the neck 13. Figure 3 shows the locked state of the spray bottle 10 following the release of cap 22. It should be emphasized that the sprayer 14 and bottle 12 are initially assembled by aligning the dogs 30 with their corresponding dog recesses 66 and forcing the two components axially together so that the dogs 30 snap over the upper bumpers 62. The wedging action of each upper bumper ramp 62 on its corresponding dog 30 causes the dogs 30 to move radially outward. The flexible portion 24 of cap 22 ovalizes by increasing in diameter between the dogs 30 and decreasing in diameter perpendicular to this direction. Inclined dog ramps 74 shown in Figures 3 and 4 on the lower edges of dogs 30 Interact with upper bumper ramps 62 to force this distortion of cap 22 to enable the dogs 30 to drop into their corresponding dog recesses 66. Figure 5 shows an elevational view of a bottle 12 , a second embodiment of the present invention. The bottle 12 is substantially similar to bottle 12 in most respects. It includes a bottle neck 13 which carries a pair of upper bumpers 58 and lower bumpers 60 . While the bumpers 58 and 60 are substantially triangular in cross section in contrast to the solid bumpers 58 and 60 of bottle 12, they still form a substantially spiral dog guide 64 which is suitable for guiding the cap dogs 30 during the coupling and uncoupling of the bottle 12 and the sprayer 14. In addition, the same sprayer 14 can be used for bottle 12 and bottle 12 . In the case of bottle 12 , however, the spiral dog guides 64 terminate in completely closed dog recesses 66 . Each closed recess 66 is formed on the top by an upper bumper ramp 62 on the bottom by a lower bumper 60 on the end of the dog guide 64 farthest from the upper lip of the bottle 12 by a dog stop 68 and at the entrance to the dog recess 66 by neck element 80 which completely spans the gap between the corresponding upper bumper ramp 62 and lower bumper 60 adjacent the upper bumper ramp 62 . Thus, where each neck element 70 of bottle 12 extends only a portion of the distance between the respective upper bumper 58 and lower bumper 60, the neck elements 80 of bottle 12 completely span this distance to form closed dog recesses 66 . During initial assembly, the sprayer 14 can be axially snapped onto bottle 12 according to the procedure outlined above in connection with bottle 12. That is, sprayer 14 is positioned so that the diametrally spaced cap dogs 30 of cap 22 align with the diametrally spaced dog recesses 66 . The sprayer 14 and bottle 12 are then axially pushed together. This causes the cap dogs 30 to contact upper bumper ramps 62 thereby ovalizingH the cap 22 and allowing the dogs 30 to fall into recesses 66 . Importantly, the initial assembly operation is the came for bottles 12 and 12 and therefore the same automated assembly equipment and methods can be used. Stated differently, the differences between bottles 12 and 12 are invisible to the assembly machines and procedures and they need not be modified when the type of bottle is changed. Removing the sprayer 14 from bottle 12 is different from removing the sprayer 14 from bottle 12, however.When bottle 12 is used, the dogs 30 are completely contained within recesses 66 following the intial assembly operation. Therefore, in order to twist the sprayer 14 out of engagement with bottle 12 , dogs 30 must pass over neck elements 80. The cap 12 ovalizes to some degree, and dogs 30 and neck elements 80 deform to allow the sprayer 14 to be removed from bottle 12 with a counterclockwise twist. This is in sharp contrast to the procedure for removing sprayer 14 from bottle 12, discussed above, wherein the sprayer 14 is pushed toward bottle 12 to compress the seal 50 and to align dogs 30 with dog escapes 71. The dogs 30 can then freely pass through escapes 71 and do not have to pass over neck elements 70. Although the spray cap removal procedure is different for the two bottles, the bottles 12 and 12 function in similar fashion. In both cases, the spray cap 14 is initially snapped in place whereby the cap dogs 30 are received by dog recesses 66 or 66 . The spray cap 14 cannot be removed by simply reversing this procedure by virtue of intereference between the cap dogs 30 and the bottom surfaces of upper bumper ramps 62 or 62 . The spray cap 14 can be twisted off, however, in both cases.Normally, the side surfaces of cap dogs 30 are in contact with neck elements 70 or 80 to prevent removal of the cap 14. The spray cap 14 can be selectively removed from bottle 12 or 12 , however, according to the procedures given above. In each case the spray cap 14 can be freely rotated out of engagement with bottle 12 or 12 once the seal 50 has been sufficiently compressed for bottle 12 or once sufficient torque is applied to spray cap 14 to overcome the resistance provided by neck elements 80. It should also be emphasized that the sprayer 14 and bottle 12 or 12 should not generally be reassembled by snapping them together as described above in connection with the initial assembly procedure. If this procedure is attempted without the benefit of precise and powerful automated equipment, the bottle 12 or 12 might slip and spill out its contents. Smoothly twisting the cap 22 to remove it or attach it is perceived to be safer and easier when the assembly disassembly operation is manual. It should be emphasized that the present invention is not limited to any particular materials or combination of materials, and modifications of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art in light of the foregoing description. This description is intended to provide specific examples of individual embodiments which clearly disclose the present invention. Accordingly, the invention is not limited to these embodiinents or to the use of elements having the specific configurations and shapes as presented herein. All alternative modifications and variations of the present invention which fall within the spirit and broad scope of the appended claims are included.
