## Description
Separation Agent ComprisingAliphatic or Aromatic Ester of polysaccharide The invention relates to a separation agent which essentially comprises an aliphatic or aromatic ester of a polysaccharide, except for cellulose acetate and an aromatic ester of cellulose. It is useful for separation of various chemical substances, especially optical resolution of optical isomers. The resolving agent of the present invention can be used for separation of all sorts of chemical substances, particularly for optical resolution of them. It has been well known that optical isomers of a chemical compound have effects different from each other in vivo generally. Therefore, it is an important problem to obtain optically pure compounds for the purposes of improving medicinal effects per unit dose of them and removing adverse reactions thereof and damages from them in medical, agricultural and biochemical fields. A mixture of optical isomers has been optically resolved by preferential crystallization or diastereomer process. However, varieties of compounds capable of being optically resolved by these processes are limited and these processes require a long time and a much labor. Under these circumstances, developsent of a technique of conducting the optical resolution by an easy chromatographic process has eagerly been demanded.Prior Art3 Chromatographic optical resolution has been investigated from old times. However, resolving agents developed heretofore have problems that they have only an unsatisfactory resolution efficiency, compounds to be resolved should have a specific functional group and their stability is only poor.Thus, it has been difficult to optically resolve all sorts of compounds with satisfactory results.Object of the Invention An object of the present invention is to provide a resolving agent having a chemical structure different from those of known resolving agents, particularly the resolving agents containing cellulose triacetate, as an effective component, and therefore, the resolving characteristics different from those of the known ones or a higher faculty of discriminating and identifying the optical isomers.CConstruction of the Invention The above mentioned object of the present invention is attained by a resolving agent containing an aliphatic acid ester of a polysaccharide excluding cellulose acetate as effective component. The resolving agent of the invention exhibits preferably different powers of adsorbing different optical isomers of a given compound. The term polysaccharides herein involves any optically active polysaccharide selected from the group consisting of synthetic, natural and modified natural polysaccharides. Among them, those having highly regular linkages are preferred. Examples of them include ss 1,4 glucans celluloses , alpha 1,4 glucans amylose and amylopectin , alpha 1,6 glucan dextran , ss 1,6 glucan pstulan , ss 1,3 glucans such as curdlan and schizophyllan, a 1,3 glucan, ss 1,2 glucan Crown gall polysaccharide , ss 1,4 galactan, ss 1,4mannan, a 1,6 mannan, ss 1,2 fructan inulin , ss 2,6 fructan levan , ss 1,4 xylan, 3 1, 3 xylan, 3 1, 4 chitosan, 3 1, 4 N acetylchitosan chitin , pullulan, agarose and alginic acid.Still preferred ones are those capable of easily yielding highly pure polysaccharides, such as cellulose, amylose, ss 1,4 chitosan, chitin, ss 1,4 mannan, 8 1,4 xylan, inulin, curdlan and a 1,3 glucan These polysaccharides have a number average degree of polymerization average number of pyranose or furanose rings in the molecule of at least 5, preferably at least 10. Though there is provided no upper limit of the degree of polymerization, it is preferably 500 or less from the viewpoint of easiness of the handling. The term aliphatic esters of polysaccharides herein refers to polysaccharides wherein 30 to 100 , preferably 85 to 100 , on average of the total hydroxyl groups are esterified with an aliphatic carboxylic acid. The term aliphatic carboxylic acids means that having an acyclic or cyclic hydrocarbon skeleton having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, being free of any aromatic or heteroaromatic group. Exaieples of them include acetic acid which is excluded when the polysaccharide is cellulose , propionic acid and cycloalkanecarboxylic acids having a 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 or 7 membered ring. They include also those having an unsaturated bond, such as propiolic and acrylic acid derivatives. These carboxylic acids may have a substituent containing a hereto atom such as a halogen, nitrogen or oxygen. The term aromatic carboxylic acids herein refers to those having an aromatic ring having 6 to 20 carbon atoms or a heteroaromatic ring having 4 to 20 carbon atoms. Preferred aromatic carboxylic acids are those having carboxyl groups directly bonded with the aromatic or heteroaromatic ring.They may have further a substituent bonded with the ring. In the polysachride, the hydroxyl groups other than those forming the linkage bond with the above mentioned carboxylic acid may be present in the form of free hydroxyl groups or they may be esterified, etherified or carbamoylated so far as the resolving ability of the resolving agent is not damaged. The esterification for forming the fatty acid esters of the polysaccharides used in the present invention may be conducted by a known process for the esterification of cellulose or amylose see, for example, Dai Yuki Sagaku 19, 1Tennen KobunshiKagaku I published by Asakura Book Store, p. 124 .For example, generally used esterifying agents are anhydrides and halides of corresponding carboxylic acids, particularly acid chlorides. It is preferred to use a tertiary amine base or Lewis acids as the catalyst. The reaction solvent may be any solvent so far as it does not inhibit the esterification reaction, such as pyridine or quinoline which acts also as the base. Frequently, a catalyst such as 4 N,N dimethylamino pyridine is effective in accelerating the reaction. Further, a corresponding carboxylic acid combined with a dehydrating agent may also be reacted with the polysaccharide to obtain the ester. Since most of the polysaccharides used as the starting material have. a low reactivity, it is preferable that, they are activated by dissolution reprecipitation or dissolution freeze drying treatment or by using a reaction solvent in which the polysaccharides are soluble. The resolving agent of the present invention is used for the purpose of resolving compounds and optical isomers thereof generally according to a chromatographic method such as gas, liquid or thin layer chromatographic method. Further, the resolving agent may be used in membrane resolution method. In using the resolving agent of the present invention in the liquid chromatography, there may be employed a method wherein the powdered resolving agent is packed in a column, a method wherein a capillary column is coated with the resolving agent, a method wherein a capillary is made from the resolving agent to use the inner wall thereof and a method wherein the resolving agent is spun and bundled up to form a column. Among them, the method wherein the powdered resolving agent is employed is most general. The separation agent of the invention is preferably used in the form of powder. It is obtained by crushing the agent or forming it into spherical beads. The particle size which varies depending on the size of a column or plate used is 1 urn to 10 mm, preferably 1 to 300 urn. The particles are preferably porous. It is preferred to support the resolving agent on a carrier so as to improve the resistance thereof to pressure or to prevent swelling or shrinkage thereof due to solvent exchange and from the viewpoint of the number of thaoretical plates. The suitable size of the carrier which varies depending on the size of the column or plate used is generally 1 urn to 10 mm, preferably 1 to 300 Wm. The carrier is preferably porous and has an average pore diameter of 10 A to 100 Wm, preferably 50 to 50,000 A. The amount of the resolving agent to be supported is 1 to 100 wt. , preferably 5 to 50 wt. , based on the carrier. The resolving agent may be supported on the carrier by either chemical or physical means. The physical means include one wherein the resolving agent is dissolved in a suitable solvent, the resulting solution is mixed with a carrier homogeneously and the solvent is distilled off by means of a gaseous stream under reduced pressure or heating and one wherein the resolving agent is dissolved in a suitable solvent, the resulting solution is mixed homogeneously with a carrier and the mixture is dispersed in a liquid incompatible with said solvent by stirring to diffuse the solvent. The resolving agent thus supported on the carrier may be crystallized, if necessary, by heat treatment or the like.Further, the state of the supported resolving agent and accordingly its resolving power can be modified by adding a small amount of a solvent thereto to temporarily swell or dissolve it and then distilling the solvent off. Both porous organic and inorganic carriers may be used, though the latter is preferred. The suitable porous organic carriers are those comprising a high molecular substance such as polystyrene, polyacrylamide or polyacrylate. The suitable porous inorganic carriers are synthetic or natural products such as silica, alumina, magnesia, titanium oxide, glass, silicate or kaolin. They may be surfacetreated so as to improve their affinity for the resolving agent. The surface treatment may be effected with an organosilan compound or by plasma polymerization. In using the resolving agent of the present invention in the resolution of compounds or optical isomers, the resolving characteristics thereof may vary sometimes depending on physical properties thereof such as molecular weight, crystallnity and orientation, even though they are chemically similar. Therefore, the resolving characteristics of the resolving agent may be altered according to the use thereof by suitably selecting the solvent used in that step or by physical treatments such as heat treatment, etching or swelling with the liquid after said step in any of the above mentioned processes. In the liquid or thin layer chromatography, any developer may be used except those in which the resolving agent is soluble or which are reactive with the resolving agent. In case the resolving agent has been bound to the carrier by the chemical process or it has been insolubilized by crosslinking, any solvent other than a reactive liquid may be used. As a matter of course, it is preferred to select the developer after examination of various developers, since the resolving characteristics of chemical substances or optical isomers vary depending on the developer used. In the thin layer chromatography, a layer having a thickness of 0.1 to 100 mm and comprising the resolving agent in the form of particles of about 0.1 pm to 0.1 mm and, if necessary, a small amount of a binder is formed on a supporting plate. In the membrane resolution process, the resolving agent is used in the form of a hollow filament or film. The resolving agent of the present invention containing the aliphatic ester of the polysaccharide as the effective component is effective for the resolution of various compounds. Particularly, it is quite effective for the resolution of optical isomers which are quite difficult to resolve.Either one of the optical isomers to be resolved is selectively adsorbed on the resolving agent. Effects of the Invention The resolving agents of the present invention were compared with cellulose triacetate after supporting them on silica beads. In the resolution of benzoin, a separation factor a of 1.10 was obtained with cellulose triscyclopropanecarboxylate, while the value of a obtained with cellulose triacetate was 1.05. In the resolution of transstilbene oxide, the values a obtained with mannan triacetate and cellulose triacetate were 1.51 and 1.22, respectively. Thus, it will be understood that the resolving agents of the present invention have excellent effects The separation agent according to the invention is useful to the optical resolution as above shown. In addition, it serves for separation of geometrical isomers and polymers having different molecular weight ranges from each other.They have not easily been separated in the state of prior arts. The following examples will further illustrate the present invention, which by no means limit the invention. In the examples, the terms are defined as follows capacity retention volume void volume ratio k void volume capacity ratio of enantiomer separation adsorbed more strongly factor a capacity ratio of enantiomer adsorbed less strongly distance between a peak of more 2 x strongly adsorbed enantiomer and that rate of of less stronglv adsorbed enantiomer separation Rs total band width of both peaks Synthesis Example 1 10 g of silica beads LiChrospher SI 1000 a product of Merck Co. was placed in a 200 mQ round bottom flask with a side arm. After vacuumdrying in an oil bath at 1200C for 3 h, N2 was introduced therein. 100 mQ of toluene which had been preliminarily distilled in the presence of CaH2 was added to the silica beads. 3 mi of diphenyldimethoxysilane KBM 202 a product of Shin t etsu Kagaku Co.,,LjLd was added to the mixture and they were stirred together and then reacted at I200C for 1 h. After distilling off 3 to 5 mQ of toluene, the reaction was carried out at 1200C for 2 h. The mixture was filtered through a glass filter, washed with 50 m of toluene three times and then with 50 m of methanol three times and dried in vacuum at 400C for 1 h. About 10 g of the silica beads were placed in the 200 mil round bottom flask with a side arm.After vacuum drying at 1000C for 3 h, the pressure was returned to the atmospheric pressure and the mixture was cooled to room temperature. Then N2 was introduced therein. 100 mb of distilled toluene was added to the dried silica beads. 1 mt of N,O bis trimethylsilyl acetamide a trimethylsilylating agent was added thereto and the mixture was stirred to effect the reaction at 115 C for 3 h. The reaction mixture was collected with a glass filter, washed with toluene and dried under vacuum for about 4 h.Synthesis Example 2 Cellulose triacetate a product of Daicel Ltd. having a nuiber average degree of polymerization of 110 and a degree of substitution of 2.97 was dissolved in 1 t of acetic acid a product of KantoKagaku Co. . 5.2 mi water and 5 mL of conc.sulfuric acid were added to the resulting solution and the reaction was carried out at 806C for 3 h.The reaction mixture was cooled and sulfuric acid was neutralized with an excess amount of an aqueous magnesium acetate solution. The resulting solution was added to 3 Q of water to precipitate cellulose triacetate having a reduced molecular weight. After collection with a glass filter G3 , it was dispersed in 1 liter of water. After collection followed by vacuum drying, the obtained product was dissolved in methylene chloride and reprecipitated from 2propanol. The dissolution and the reprecipitation were repeated twice to effect the purification. The product was dried. According to the IR and NMR spectra, the product was identified with cellulose triacetate. The number average molecular weight of the product as determined by vapor pressure asmometry was 7900, which corresponded to the number average degree of polymerization of 27.The vapor pressure osmometry was conducted with a vapor pressure osmometer Corona 117 using a solvent mixture of chloroform 1 ethanol. 60 g of the obtained cellulose triacetate was dispersed in 200 mi of 2 propanol. 60 mi of 100 hydrazine hydrate a product of Nakrai Chemicals Ltd. was added dropwise slowly to the dispersion under gentle stirring. The suspension was maintained at 600C for 3 h and the resulting cellulose was filtered through a glass filter, washed with acetone repeatedly and dried in vacuo at 600C. In the IR spectrum of the product, no absorption due to the carbonyl group at around 1720 cm was observed and the IR spectrum coincided with that of cellulose.Synthesis Example 3 Synthesis of cellulose triscyclopropanecarboxylate 90 mQ of dehydrated pyridine, 15.4 mQ of dehydrated triethylamine and 100 mL of 4 dimethylaminopyridine were added to 3 g of the cellulose obtained in Synthesis Example 2. 17.4 g of cyclopropanecarbonyl chloride was added thereto under stirring and the mixture was stirred at 1000C for 5 h to carry out the reaction After cooling, the product was added to 500 mQ of ethanol under stirring to form a precipitate, which was collected with a glass filter and washed thoroughly with ethanol. After drying in vacuo, the product was dissolved in 30 m of methylene chloride. After an insoluble matter was removed, the residue was reprecipitated from 400 m of ethanol.The precipitate was collected, washed with ethanol, dehydrated and dried to obtain 4.2 g of cellulose triscyclopropanecarboxylate. The product was dissolved in methylene chloride and the solution was applied to a sodium chloride plate and dried.The infrared absorption spectrum of the product had the following characteristic absorption bands 2900 to 3100 cm stretching vibration of C H of cyclopropane ring, 1740 cm 1 stretching vibration of C O of carboxylic acid ester, 1450 cm 1 deformation vibration of C H of cyclopropane ring, 1260 cm 1 stretching vibration of C O of ester, and 1060 to 1160 cm 1 stretching vibration of C O C of cellulose. Substantially no absorption at around 3450 cm 1 due to OH of cellulose was observed. This fact suggested that the product substantially comprised a trisubstituted compound. In the proton NMR spectrum determined in CDC13, the characteristic absorption bands were as follows 0.6 to 1.2 ppm methylene proton of cyclopropane ring, 1.4 to 1.9 ppm methyne proton of cyclopropane ring, and 3.4 to 5.4 ppm protons of the cellulose ring and methylene in position 6 The ratio of these absorption intensities was 12 3 7, which coincided with that of the trisubstituted compound.Example 1 1.2 g of cellulose triscyclopropanecarboxylate obtained in Synthesis Example 3 was dissolved in 10 mQ of dichloromethane. 3.2 g of the silica beads obtained in Synthesis Example 1 were impregnated with 7.5 mt of the solution. The solvent was distilled off under reduced pressure to obtain a powdery, supported material.Example 2 Albumens of seeds of ivory palm were treated by a process disclosed in literature Csee G.O.Aspinall et al., J. Chem. Soy, , 3184 1953 3 to obtain mannan B from a high molecular weight fraction. 1.5 g of powder of mannan B was mixed with 50 mt of dehydrated pyridine, 10 mQ of dehydrated triethylamine and 100 mg of 4 dimethylaminopyridine. 20 mQ of acetic anhydride was added thereto under stirring. The reaction was carried out at 100etc for 6.5 h. After cooling, the product was added to 400 mQ of ethanol under stirring to form a precipitate, which was filtered and collected with a glass filter, washed thoroughly with ethanol and dried in vacuo to obtain 1.7 g of a product. The product, i.e. ss 1,4 mannan acetate, was insoluble in methylene chloride.In the IR absorption spectrum, a considerably intense absorption due to OH was observed at around 3450 cm 1 The product was acetylated again as follows the whole of the product was dissolved in 10 m of dichloromethane, 1.5 mQ of acetic anhydride and 2.5 m of trifluoroacetic anhydride. The solution was kept at room temperature for one day. A volatile matter was distilled off under reduced pressure and the residue was washed with ethanol. The product was dried. 1.2 g of the product was dissolved in 4 m of dichloromethane, 3 m of trifluoroacetic acid and 0.5 m of acetic anhydride. The solution was kept at room temperature for a whole day and night. 3.2 g of the silica beads obtained inSynthesis Example 1 was impreganted with 7.5 m of the solution. The solvent was distilled off under reduced pressure to form a powdery, supported material. In the I.R. absorption spectrum of the product recovered from a part of said solution by precipitation, an absorption peak peculiar to the acetate was observed but the absorption due to the 1 free hydroxyl group at around 3500 cm was quite weak to suggest that the product was a trisubstituted compound.Application Example 1 The silica beads carrying cellulose triscyclopropanecarboxylate obtained in Example 1 were packed in a stainless steel column having a length of 25 cm and an inner diameter of 0.46 cm by slurry process.
