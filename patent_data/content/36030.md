## Description
Process for Preparing Biotin The present invention relates to a process for preparing biotin. In this specification, the term lower is intended to mean a group having not more than eight carbon atoms, particularly having not more than five carbon atoms. Biotin, the chemical name of which is cis tetra hydro 2 oxothienof3,4 d imidazoline 4 valtEric acid, has an asymmetric carbon, and the term biotin in the present invention includes ioth of d biotin and dl biotin. Biotin also called Vitamin H s a valuable substance exerting a growth accelerative effect as well as a preventive and therapeutic effect on dermatoses, etc. For the production of biotin, there is known a method wherein 3,4 1 ,3 dibenzyl 2 ketoimidazolido 2 w carboxybutyl t hiophane is heated under reflux in 48 hydrobromic acid to affect debenzylation U.S. Patent No.3,740,416 . However, this method is not favorable because it gives the objective compound only in a poor yield in spite of the troublesome operation due to the use of an irritative reagent. As the result of an extensive study, it has now been established an improved process for preparing biotin in an excellent yield with a high purity and without any disadvantage as seen in the said conventional process. Thus, the present invention provides an industrially advantageous process for preparing biotin which comprises heating a compound of the formula EMI2.1 wherein R1 and R2 are each hydrogen or benzyl and R3 is hydrogen or carboxyl, with the proviso that RÚ and Rê are not simultaneously hydrogen in the presence of a lower alkanesulfonic acid. According to the invention, a mixture of one part by weight of the starting compound I and 1 to 100 parts by weight, preferably 3 to 50 ports by weight, of a lower alkanesulfonic acid e.g., methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, propanesulfonic acid is heated at a temperature of 80 to 1800C, preferably of 110 to 1500C, for a period of 10 minutes to 20 hours, preferably of 0.5 to 10 hours. The reaction mixture is cooled and then admixed with water. Precipitated crystals are collected by filtration and recrystallized from water to give purified crystals of biotin. It is not requisite but preferred to add to the reaction system a hydrocarbon having a boiling point higher than 1000C e.g., chlorobenzene, toluene, xylene, octane, decane, anisole and or an alkanoic acid, preferably having 2 to 4 carbon atoms e.g., acetic acid, propionic acid , in order to minimize the formation of by products and easily control the reaction temperature. The starting compound I may be derived from 3,4 1 ,3 dibenzyl 2l ketoimidazolido 2 di lower alkoxy carbonylbutyl thiophane nereinafter referred to as compound II by saponification optionally followed by decarboxylation and or partial debenzylation. Specific examples of the compound II are 3,4 1 ,3 dibenzyl 2 ketoimidazolido 2 , dimethoxvcarbonylbutyl thiophane, 3,4 1 , 3 dib nzyl 2 ketoimidazolido 2 w,w diethoxy carbonylbutyl thiophane, 3,4 1 ,3 dibenzyl 2 ketoimida zolido 2 X methoxycarbonyl U ethoxycarbonylbutyl thio phane, etc. The starting compound tI thus prepared may be separated from the reaction mixture and subjected to the process of the invention. However, it can be directly converted to biotin in situ, i.e., without separation from the reaction mixture. The typical example for preparing biotin from the compound II without separation of the compound 11 is illustrated below. A mixture of the compound 11 and a lower aSane sulfonic acid containing water water content, usually not more than 40 by weight is heated at a temperature of 40 to 1000C, preferably of 70 to 950C, for 2 to 20 hours in the presence or absence of an alkanoic acid, preferably having 2 or 3 carbon atoms, whereby saponification proceeds to give.a reaction mixture containing 3,4 1 , 31 dibenzyl 2 keto imidazolido 2 dicarboxybuttl thiophane. The reaction mixture is continuously heated at a temperature of 100 to 1800C, preferably of 110 to 1500C, for 1 to 20 hours while distilling off volatile components e.g., water, alcohols, esters , whereby decarboxylation and debenzylation proceed to give a reaction mixture containing biotin. The reaction mixture is worked up in the same manner as previously mentioned to give purified crystals of biotin. This modified process for preparing biotin from the compound 11 without separation of the compound I constitutes one embodiment of the present invention. The compound II is obtainable by reacting 3,4 1 ,3 dibenzyl 2 ketoimidazolido 1,2 trimethylenethiophanium bromide or d camphor sulfonate with a malonic diester according to U.S. patent 3,740,416 or 2,489,235. As stated above, the process of this invention can advantageously afford biotin in an excellent yield with a high purity. It is particularly notable that biotin of high optical purity is obtainable by the use of the starting compound I which is optically active. Accordingly, this invention can provide an extermely important and valuable process for the synthesis of d biotin which is, in particular, physiologically active.
