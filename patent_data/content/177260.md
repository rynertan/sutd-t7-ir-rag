# Aqueous dispersed solution of substituted succinic anhydride and process for producing the same.

## Abstract
An aqueous dispersed solution of a substituted succinic anhydride which comprises an aqueous soluble copolymer A having 50 percent or more by mol of meth acrylamide a 1 percent or more by mol of N,N dialkylamino.alkyl methy acrylamide b as monomer ingredients, aqueous soluble copolymer B having 50 percent or more by mol of meth acrylamide a , 1 percent or more by mold of N,N dialkylamino.alkyl meth acrylamide b and 49 percent or less by mol of other copolymer monomer c as monomer ingredients, or both of the aqueous soluble copolymer A and the aqueous soluble copolymer B , and a process for producing an aqueous dispersed solution of a substituted succinic anhydride prepared by dispersing the aqueous soluble copolymer A or the aqueous soluble copolymer B or a mixture C of 99 to 99.9 percent by weight of the substituted succinic anhydride d and 10 to 0.1 percent by weight of an oil in water type surfactant e in aqueous solution containing both the aqueous soluble copolymer A and the aqueous soluble copolymer B . Thus, the aqueous dispersion can provide an excellent sizing effect in case applied as a sizing agent in paper making process but also has preferable dilute dispersibility of aqueous dispersion, does not possibly contaminate wires, rolls and carpets of a paper making machine when applied as a sizing agent in the practical paper making process with properties of capable of continuously operating for a long period of time.
