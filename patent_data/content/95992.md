# Rocker cam control.

## Abstract
A variable displacement, rocker cam type, axial piston pump 10 in which the rocker cam 32 is driven by a stroking piston 51 and the stroking piston is connected to the rocker cam 32 by a pair of flexible connectors 61, 62 and tension in the first flexible connector is raised and tension in the second flexible connector is lowered when the stroking piston is moved in one direction to pivot the rocker cam toward a posi tion of maximum fluid displacement and tension in the second flexible connector is raised and tension in the first flexible con nector is lowered when the stroking piston is moved in the other direction to pivot the rocker cam toward a position of minimum fluid displacement.
