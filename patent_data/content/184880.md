# Recovery of glycerine from saline waters.

## Abstract
Glycerine is recovered from an aqueous waste stream con taining but minor amounts of glycerine by the steps of 1 evaporating, 2 contacting with pentanol, 3 separating precipitated salt, 4 flashing to remove pentanol, and 5 vacu um distillation. This process is particularly useful treating saline waste water resulting from the manufacture of epoxy resins.
