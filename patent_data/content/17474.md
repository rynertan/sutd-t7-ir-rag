# Reforming with an improved rhenium containing catalyst.

## Abstract
An improved process for the reforming of a hydrocarbon stream, which process comprises contacting said hydrocar bon stream under reforming conditions and in the presence of hydrogen with a catalyst which comprises platinum, rhenium, a small amount of palladium, i.e. about 0.05 wt. to about 1 wt. and combined halogen on a refractory inorganic oxide, such as an alumina, and which has not been presulfided. The feedstock being reformed can contain up to about 50 ppm sulfur.
