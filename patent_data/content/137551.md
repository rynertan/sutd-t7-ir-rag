# Liquid thickened bleaching composition.

## Abstract
Thickened, pourable liquid bleaching compositions which have been thickened with the aid of two different detergent active materials, e.g. a tertiary amine oxide with a saturated fatty acid soap or an alkali metal sarcosinate often show a decrease in viscosity on storage of the composition. By inclusion of a third, synthetic detergent of the sulphate or sulphonate type, e.g. an alkylethersulphate, compositions are obtained with a significantly reduced decrease of viscosity during storage, particularly over longer periods and at higher storage temperatures. The compositions are useful for bleaching hard surfaces.
