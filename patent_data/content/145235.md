# Cationic polymerisation of 1 olefins.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a process for producing polyiso butene which has at least 70 of its unsaturation in the terminal position. The process uses a complex of boron trifluoride and alcohol as catalyst and a contact time of at least 8 minutes. The feature of the process is its ability to use longer contact times than used hitherto thereby facilitating its commercial operation and improving the control of such an operation. The high terminal unsaturation improves the reactivity of the polymer.
