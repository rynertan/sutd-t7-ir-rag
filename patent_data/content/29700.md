# Analog to digital converter.

## Abstract
In a differential amplifier 2 , which is associated with a digital to analog converter 4 and a register 3 and serves as an element of an analog to digital converter, a required offset input voltage characteristic is achieved by selecting, for example, the ratio of the emitter areas of a pair of transistors 23, 24 so that no offset characteristic is required for the digital to analog converter associated with the dif ferential amplifier.
