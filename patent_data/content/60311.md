## Description
Composition and process for coating films to be used in the packaging and wrapping field The present invention relates to a composition and a process for coating films, such as polymeric films, to be used in the wrapping and packaging field.Generally the films used for wrapping and packaging, especially food products, are coated to give them slip, anti static and other machinability properties, heat weldability and improved barrier properties impermeability to gases and vapours . Among the coating compositions most used are those based on vinyl and vinylidene polymers and acrylic or methacrylic ester polymers on account of their marked ability to simultaneously confer satisfactory characteristics of ease of handling, impermeability and heat weldability on the films to which they are applied. In this connection reference is made to U.S. Patents Nos. 2,805,963, 2,829,068 and 2,829,069.One of problems which most afflict these coating composi tions is that they do not adhere stably to the films to which they are applied. Thus, for example, the surfaces of polyolefin films and other films which are poorly receptive to coatings of any type must be pretreated with, for example, chemical agents, non perforating continuous electric discharges or flame action. Examples of filmsurface treatments are given, for example, in U.K. PatentsNos. 811,370, 834,196, 842,104 and 910,317.Despite these treatments, which have the effect of creating functional groups on the surfaces, the reactivity of these surfaces is generally insufficient to allow good adhesion of the aforesaid coating compositions.Recourse has therefore been made, in the art, to the additional application of adhesion promoters primers , generally chosen from pre polymerized polyesters, polyurethanes, isocynates and polyimines as described, for example, in U.K. Patent No. 677,926, U.S. Patent No.2,876,067 and Belgian Patent No. 626,363. The application of adhesion promoters improves the adhesion of the coatings to the support film, but the results still do not satisfy all the requirements of the uses of the coated films.More recently, recourse has been made, during the preparation of the polymers used in the coating compositions, to the addition of resins which react with the starting monomers. This method, together with the pre treatment of the film surfaces and the application of adhesion promoters, has resulted in considerable improvements in the anchorage of the coatings to the support films but is not completely satisfactory because of its deleterious influence, sometimes even considerable, on the optical characteristics of the finished product.These disadvantages have been overcome by the coating composition of the present invention which allows coated films to be made with very good optical properties, handling qualities and impermeability and weld strength characteristics, together with high, stable adhesion of the coating to the support film, even in the absence of the adhesion promoters of the known art.The invention provides a coating composition for films to be used in the packaging and wrapping field, in particular polymeric films such as the polyesters and polyolefins, based on a polymeric material chosen from vinyl and vinylidene chloride homopolymers and copolymers, acrylic and methacrylic ester homopolymers and copolymers and mixtures thereof, charaacterized in that it contains at least one additive constituted by an organic substance having epoxy groups and aliphatic unsaturation, obtained by the reaction of one or more unsaturated aliphatic monocarboxylic acids and or monoesters of unsaturated aliphatic dicarboxylic acids, with a stoichiometric excess of epoxy or epoxy novolak resin, so that part of the epoxy groups of said resin are left unchanged in the reaction. According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a process for precoating films to be used in the wrapping and packaging field with the said coating composition.The epoxy resins useful for the preparation of the additives of the present invention are compounds definable by means of the general formula EMI4.1 where R represents an aryl, cycloalkyl or alkyl radical and n has values of from 0 to about 19.One class of resins defined by the general formula I , in which O R O is a diphenol radical, is obtained in the art by the reaction of a diphenol with epichlorohydrin in the presence of an inorganic base. Particularly useful resins belonging to this class are those obtained from 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propane bisphenol A and epichlorohydrin, as described, for example, inU.S. Patents Nos. 4,017,523 and 4,132,718.Another class of epoxy resins may be obtained from epichlorohydrin and aliphatic or cycloaliphatic diols.In this case, the diol is reacted with epichlorohydrin in the presence of an alkylation catalyst and the product obtained is treated with an inorganic base. Particularly useful resins in this class are obtained from 2,2 bis 4hydroxycyclohexyl propane and epichlorohydrin as described, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 3,781,244.The epoxy novolak resins, as is known, are the products of the epoxidation of phenolic novolak resins, these last resins being the condensation products of phenol and or substituted phenols with formaldehyde as described, for example, in U.S. Patents Nos. 3,860,561 and 3,867,346.One class of epoxy novolak resins which is particularly useful for the preparation of the additives of the present invention is obtained by the reaction of epichlorohydrin with a phenolic novolak resin product of the condensation of phenol with formaldehyde in the presence of an inorganic base and can be represented by the general formula EMI5.1 in which m may vary from 0 to about 10.The additives of the present invention are prepared by reacting the epoxy resin or the epoxy novolak resin with an unsaturated aliphatic monocarboxylic acid, or with a monoester of an unsaturated aliphatic dicarboxylic aci d, in ratios such as to make at least 10 per cent but not more than 90 per cent of the epoxy groups of the epoxy or epoxy novolak resin react with the acid.The unsaturated aliphatic monocarboxylic acids may contain up to 20 carbon atoms per molecule, but short chain acids, such as acrylic or methacrylic acid, are preferable. The monoes ters of the unsaturatcd aliphatic dicarboxylic acids are preferably chosen from the monoesters of maleic or fumaric acid with a monohydric alcohol having from 1 to 12 carbon atoms per molecule.The reaction of the monocarboxylic acid or the monoester of the dicarboxylic acid with the epoxy resin or the epoxy novolak resin is generally carried out at a temperature of from 1000 to 2400C for a time such as to reduce the acid value of the reaction mixture to negligibly low values.In a preferred embodiment of the present invention from 30 to 70 per cent of the epoxy groups of the epoxy or epoxy novolak resins are made to react, the fact that one epoxy group of the resin interacts with one molecule of the monocarboxylic acid or of the monoester of the dicarboxylic acid being taken into account. Best results are generally obtained with additives in which the ratio between epoxy groups and aliphatic double bonds is equal to or of the order of 1 1.By way of example, if the epoxy resin 1 is reacted with acrylic acid in equi molecular quantities, one obtains an additive which can be represented by the general formula EMI7.1 Similarly if equi molecular quantities of the epoxy novolak resin 2 and acrylic acid are reacted one obtains an additive which can be represented by the general formula EMI7.2 In general, the additives are liquid or solid at ambient temperatures and have the following general characteristics epoxy equivalent number of epoxy groups in lOOg of additive from 0.05 to 0.35 bromine value from 80 to 150 acid value from 0.1 to 20.It has been found that the additives described above, containing epoxy groups and aliphatic unsaturations in their molecules within the ranges indicated above are efficient at achieving strong adhesion between polymeric films, especially polyolefin and polyester films, and coating polymers or copolymers and this adhesion is achieved even in the absence of adhesion promoters, for example on polyolefin films treated simply with chemical agents, continuous electric discharges or by flame actionThe quantity of additive able to bind the coating to the polymeric support is generally from 1 to 50 per cent by weight with respect to the sum of the weight of the polymeric coating material and the additive the best results are generally obtained with an amount of additive of from 5 to 20 per cent by weight with respect to the said sum.Preferred vinyl and vinylidene polymers and copolymers are vinyl chloride and vinyl acetate homopolymers, vinyl chloride vinyl acetate copolymers containing from 80 to 95 per cent by weight of vinyl chloride, vinyl chloride vinylidene chloride copolymers containing from 40 to 60 per cent by weight of vinyl chloride and vinylidene chloride acrylonitrile copolymers containing from 80 to 95 per cent by weight of vinylidene chloride. The acrylic or methacrylic homopolymers and copolymers are generally the products of the polymerization or copolymerization of alkyl esters of acrylic and methacrylic acids, in which the alkyl group contain from 1 to 5 carbon atoms. The preferred esters are methyl, ethyl, butyl and isobutyl esters. Mixtures of two or more of the polymers and copolymers mentioned above may be used to advantage.In one embodiment of the present invention, the acrylic and or methacrylic ester polymers or copolymers are used in mixtures with vinyl and or vinylidene polymers or copolymers in proportions such that these latter do not exceed 70 per cent by weight of the total weight of the mixture and the additive.The composition according to the invention may also contain conventional additives such as waxes, slip agents, plasticizers, antistatic agents and others.The composition of the present invention may be used in the form of a solution in an organic solvent, in the form of a dispersion in a diluent or in the absence of solvents and diluents. The composition is preferably used in the form of a solution having generally a dry matter content of from 20 to 40 , and preferably from 25 to 35 , by weight. Aromatic hydrocarbons and preferably aliphatic esters and ketones may be used as solvents. Numerous films may be coated according to the process of the present invention. Examples are polyolefin films, formed from homopolymers or copolymers, polyester films, polyvinyl chloride films, polystyrene films, and also aluminium, paper and cellophane films. The films generally have a thickness in the range 10 to 100 microns.The compositions of the present invention are particularly suitable for coating polyolefin and polyester films and especially for coating non oriented, or mono or biaxially oriented polypropylene films. The best results are achieved by using an isotactic, bi oriented polypropylene film as the support.Before coating the films, and particularly polyolefin films, conventional surface treatments are generally carried out with chemical reagents such as oxidizing solutions or preferably by a flame treatment, or by electric discharge in the presence of air or another gas.An adhesion promoter may then be applied to the treated film surface although this is not indispensible for good anchorage of the coating to the support to be achieved. The adhesion promoters are usually chosen from the polyimines, such as polyethylenimine and polypropyler.imi ne which are conveniently applied in aqueous alcoholic solution.The surface treatment, and also the optional application of the adhesion promoter, may be carried out by any one of the methods known in the art. Clearly it is possible to coat only one surface of the film or both surfaces or to coat a laminate.The coating method is not critical and may be chosen from the usual methods such as those known as gravure roll, reverse roll and kiss roll, this being followed by drying at a temperature of from 80 to 1200C, for example by passing the coated film through a tunnel through which hot gas generally air flows.The quantity of coating composition as dry matter is generally from 1 to 3 grams per square metre of film surface. Generally it is not convenient to fall below 2 lg m in that the coated films obtained are unsuited to many purposes, while no substantial advantages are achieved with quantities of coating composition greater than 2 3g m . The best results are obtained with quantities of coating composition of the order of 1.5 to 2 g m2. The films are easily coated with a single application of the solution or dispersion of the composition although further layers may be applied without departing from the scope of the invention.The introduction of the additives into the coating composition permits coated films to be obtained with surprisingly good characteristics of adhesion to the support film, together with good optical, impermeability and blocking characteristics and handling qualities. The introduction of the additive also affords an improvement in the strength and heat resistance of the welds.The invention will now be illustrated by means of the following non limitative examples.Example IAn epoxy resin is used which is prepared from bisphenol A and epichlorohydrin and has an epoxy equivalent of 0.21, this being understood as the number of epoxy groups contained in 100 grams of resin.66.25 parts by weight of methyl ethyl ketone and 430.17 parts by weight of the epoxy resin described above are loaded into a reactor furnished with an agitator, a reflux condenser and temperature regulating jacket, operating in the presence of a flow of nitrogen. The temperature of the reactor is brought to 1000C and 77.07 parts by weight of mono isobutyl ester of maleic acid are added over a period of 20 minutes while the temperature is brought to about 1200C. This temperature is maintained until the acid value of the product is in the range 0.5 to 1.2, expressed as mg of KOH per gram, and until said product has a viscosity of from 40 to 60 cps, evaluated at 250C in a 50 by weight solution in methyl ethyl ketone.Thus an additive is obtained having an epoxy equivalent value of 0.066 to 0.077, given as the number of epoxy groups per 100 grams of the additive, and a viscosity within the range of values indicated above. Example 2Operating as in Example 1, an additive is prepared by using 100 parts by weight of epoxy novolak resin having an epoxy equivalent of 0.55 and 31 parts by weight of the mono isobutyl ester of maleic acid.The epoxy novolak resin is the product of the reaction of epichlorohydrin with a phenol novolak resin obtained by the condensation of formaldehyde with phenol. The additive thus obtained has an acid value of 1 0 and an epoxy equivalent value of 0.33.Example 3Operating as in Example 1, an additive is prepar ed by using 100 parts by weight of epoxy resin from bisphenol A and epichlorohydrin having an epoxy equivalent of 0.21 and 17.8 parts by weight of the mono isobutyl ester of maleic acid. The additive thus obtained has an acid value of O.G arid an epoxy equivalent value of 0.77.Example 4Operating as in Example 1, an additive is prepared by using 100 parts by weight of the epoxy resin of Example 3 and 13.5 parts by weight of the monomethyl ester of maleic acid. The additive thus obtained has an acid value of 1.2 and an epoxy equivalent value of 0.087.Example 5Operating as in Example 1, an additive is prepared by using 100 parts by weight of the epoxy resin of Example 3 and 23.8 parts by weight of the mono iso octyl ester of maleic acid. The additive thus obtained has an acid value of 0.3 and an epoxy equivalent value of 0.072.
