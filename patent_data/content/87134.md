# Low traction barrier method and apparatus for preventing traverse of gypsy moth caterpillars and similar destructive crawlers.

## Abstract
A strip of slippery, compliant material 22 has low traction characteristics with respect to gypsy moth caterpil lars and thus initially arriving caterpillars do not become stuck on the barrier 10 and do not form bridges across the barrier 10 over which later arrivals can crawl. Self adhering adhesive material 16 extends longitudinally on one surface of the strip 12 along at least one of its longitudinal margins 14, 14A , The strip 12 is wrapped around and is adhered to the trunk 20 of a tree to provide a barrier 10 for preventing gypsy moth caterpillars from traversing either up or down the tree trunk 20 by causing them to slip off of the barrier 10 and fall to the ground whenever they attempt to traverse it.

## Description
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The highly destructive nature of the gypsy moth caterpillar Lymantria Dispar toward a wide variety of tree and plant foliage commonly found throughout the United States is a well know and documented fact. Currently, hugh efforts and a broad spectrum of materials and methods are being used in attempts to control thi insect in our severely infested eastern states. These efforts include broad scale chemical and biological pesticide applications, the rearing and release of artificial populations of insect parasites, the use of pheromones in confusion and trapping devices, an the selective use of tree banding materials and devices to limit caterpillar mobility in trees during certain stages in their life. In mid April through May overwintering gypsy ath egg masses hatch. Each typically releases hundreds of small caterpillar larvae, each being approximately 1.56 itin in size. Several hours after hatching, the small caterpillars search for and ascend trees or other tall objects located nearby.After reaching the to of the object they climbed, the caterpillars attach themselves to a limb or other convenient overhanging point and descend through the air on silk threads Subsequent winds break the threads and carry the caterpillars en mass through the air until they land on distant foliage, take up residence, begin feeding and continue their life cycle Feeding caterpillars exhibit certain unique behavior. pat terns, particularly during their later growth stages, that can be exploited advantageously by the use of certain tree barrier deviceDuring their second and third instar stages, many caterpillars fee only at night to avoid daytime detection by predators. During pre dawn hours, considerable numbers of caterpillars can be observed climbing down tree trunks to hide in the forest litter during the daylight hours.At dusk, the caterpillars become active and ascen the trees to continue feeding throughout the nighttime hours.Barrier tapes placed around tree trunks to stop climbing caterpillars can be used to help control their daily migratory behavior.Later stage caterpillars in their fourth and fifth instars feed continuously throughout a 24 hour period. If trees on which they are feeding are defpliated during this period, the caterpillars will descend and migrate en mass along the ground in search of fooWhen a suitable host tree is found, access is gained to its foliag canopy by vertical ascent up the tree trunk. Isolated host trees with intact foliage and no overlappin limb contact with nearby infested trees are particularly prone to infestation by ground migrating caterpillars. Many instances also exist in residential areas where trees have been sprayed and protected against early infestations. At a later date these trees be come reinfested with ground migrating caterpillars after insecticide residual protection disappears. Barrier products placed around tree trunks are particularly helpful under these circumstances, because the barriers inhibit caterpillar access to tree canopies from ground level. The situations described above namely, individual isolated trees or small stand locations, previous spray treatments and localized migration patterns, are common occurrences in residential areas. Therefore, barrier products are advantageous to the individual homeowner in helping him cope with and limit the damage to trees on his property. Additionally, if designed properly, suc barrier products can also be used on outbuildings and other structures to prevent mass agregation of caterpillars on their exterior surfaces another obnoxious problem encountered with this pest. There are currently numerous banding devices and material either being marketed or commonly used as home remedy cures for controlling caterpillar movement up trees. The products being sol are double side coated adhesive tapes, banding devices containing insecticides, and adhesive pastes or sprays designed for application around tree trunks. Home remedy devices include wrapping tre trunks with plastic food wrap film, aluminum foil and burlap bags or strips. All of these approaches have inherent disadvantages Both double side sticky tape and adhesive paste or adhesive spray formulations become ineffective in time due to the collection of dust, dirt, debris, or entrapped caterpillars. These conditions allow easy bridging by subsequent migrating caterpillars.Tacky pastes or spray formulations can be injurious to the living layers of the tree trunk and often cause near permanent disfigurement of trees. Banding devices containing insecticides require physical handling of the pesticides contained therein, thu exposing the user. Moreover, these banding devices are designed to introduce pesticides into the environment where exposure to non target, beneficial insects and mammals such as spiders, released gypsy moth parasites, bees, birds, and squirrels is unavoidable. The use of home remedies such as banding tree trunks with wide plastic film and aluminum foil sheets also has drawbacks.Voids formed between the film or foil surfaces in bark fissures and crevices provide damp unventilated pockets that provide ideal locations for fungal growth and attack sites on the tree. These voids can also provide protected sites for subsequent invasion by tree boring insedts or other harmful parasites. Burlap bands do not really stop caterpillar migration, but only serve to provide shelter to those caterpillars desiring it. Such bands can be easily negotiated by caterpillars climbing upwards toward the tree canopy. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION A method and apparatus are provided for preventing gypsy moth caterpillars and other destructive crawling insects from ascending tree trunks and the like for reaching the foliage. A lowtraction barrier formed from a slippery, compliant material is wrapped around and adhered to a tree trunk by adhesive material ex tending longitudinally along at least one longitudinal margin on one surface of the strip. Caterpillars ascending the tree trunk cannot traverse the slippery low traction barrier and fall from the tree before reaching the foliage. Likewise, caterpillars descending the trunk slip off of the trunk while negotiating the barrier and are unable thereafter to ascend back up because of the presence of the traction barrier. In one aspect of the invention, the adhesive material on the strip extends longitudinally along the top margin of the stripAs the strip is being wrapped around the trunk with its top margin being adhered to the bark, the top margin is folded by crimping be tween the thumbs into approximately equidistantly spaced pleats for forming a skirt barrier. This pleating effect along the top margin of the strip provides excees material relative to the circumference of the trunk, thereby causing the main body of the stri to form an outwardly flared low traction skirt extending downwards and outwardly from the upper affixed margin of the strip. This skirt configuration advantageously doubles the slippery low traction surface area over which either an ascending or descending caterpillar must traverse in order to attempt passing the barrier band. Furthermore, the skirt requires a caterpillar to negotiate a 1800 inversion against gravitational forces acting on the caterpillar when attempting to crawl down around the lower edge of the skirt. The action of the low traction, compliant skirt is to greatly enhance the probability that a caterpillar will be unable to traverse the barrier, and will fall to the ground without reac ing the foliage of the tree. The various embodiments of the method and apparatus of the present invention are easy to use and handle. Each of the embodiments to be described avoids the use of the now commonly used double sided sticky barrier band and the many concomitant disadvantages of exposed sticky surfaces as discussed herein. Moreover, the various embodiments of the present method and apparatus avoid the handling and use of pesticides, thus saving the user from exposure to pesticides and thus saving the environment and the helpful insects, bees,etc., and birds and squirrels from exposure thereto.

Fig. 2 is a cross sectional view of the barrier shown inFig. 1 as seen looking along the line 2 2 in Fig. 1. Fig. 3 is an elevational view of a second embodiment of low traction barrier strip in accordance with another aspect of the present invention. Fig. 4 is a cross sectional view of the barrier shown inFig. 3 as seen looking along the line 4 4 in Fig. 3. Fig. 5 is a perspective view of the barrier shown inFigs. 1 and 2 affixed to a tree trunk to define a downwardly outwardly extending skirt. The upper margin of the compliance, lo traction strip is adhered to the bark and is tucked into crevices and fissures in the bark to prevent tunnels and is crimped at intervals between the thumbs as it is being applied to form the downwardly outwardly flaring low traction barrier skirt. Fig. 6 shows the upper margin of the strip being folded or crimped between the thumbs for forming a pleat for providing the outwardly flared skirt. Discussion of the Preferred Embodiments Figures 1 6 of the drawings illustrate the preferred embodiments of the low traction barrier method and apparatus for preventing traverse of gypsy moth caterpillars or similar destructive crawlers, in accordance with the present invention. Referring first to Figures 1 and 2, a low traction steep barrier is generally designated by the reference number 10. The barrier includes a strip 12 of thin gauge, compliant material measuring 7.62 to 15.24 mm in width whose surface properties exhibit a low traction or slippery effect such that gypsy moth caterpillars actually cannot gain sufficient foothold for transport across the surface of the strip 12 when this D thin gauge material is oriented in a vertical or near vertical position. Preferably this compliant thin gauge material has a thickness in the range from 0.013 mm 0.5 mils to 0.076 mm 3 mils or more. If this strip of material 12 is too thin, it is unduly filmy, fragile and difficult to handle.On the other hand, if this material 12 is too thick it is not compliant enough for its top margin to be readily forced into crevices and fissures in the bark, and too thick material tends to spring out of such indentations. The thickness of the compliant strip 12 is not a critical factor so long as the required high compliance or flexibility is maintained for achieving snug, close and essentially gap free adherent attachment of this material to a tree trunk or other surface as described below. It is also noted that if this material is unnecessarily thick, a waste of material is involved. In this presently preferred embodiment the strip 12 is 0.025 mm thick. Applied to this strip 12 of slippery material along the top margin 14 is a band of self adhering adhesive 16 covered by an attendant release tape 18 approximately 1 to 2 inches in width. This release tape 18 has the same width as the underlying adhesive 16. In practice as shown in Figs.5 and 6 the.release tape 18 is removed from the adhesive 16 for exposing this adhesive, and then the barrier strip 12 is affixed along its top margin 14 to and around the circumference of a tree trunk 20, being adhered to the bark by the adhesive 16. While positioning the barrier strip 12 around the trunk 20, the adhesive coated top margin 14 of the strip is pushed firmly into bark fissures to hold this top margin in close conformity to the bark or surface contours for preventing voids or tunnels beneath the barrier through which some caterpillars 22 might crawl. Contact with and close conformity to the bark surface is desirable to maximize adhesive contact area along the margin 14 for secure attachment and also to prevent gaps through which caterpillars may crawl. When the top margin 14 of the barrier 10 is forced into close conformity with the rough bark of a tree, the longitudinal length of this margin 14 as it follows the bark convolutions will exceed the circumference of the trunk 10 as measured by stretching a string tightly around the trunk. Consequently, the resultant excess material will cause the main body of the strip 12 below the margin 14 to flare outwardly in a skirt configuration or skirt effect 24. If the barrier 10 is being applied to smooth barked trees or surface, the upper margin is folded over on itself or pleated periodically, for example every 10.16 to 15.24 cm as needed for causing the barrier 10 to form this skirt effect 24. As indicated above, the application of this barrier 10 to deeply fissured bark yields the same skirt effect 24 .This pleating is accomplished as shown in Fig. 6 by crimping the upper margin 14 between the thumbs 26 with the self sticking adhesive 18 being located on the interior of the resultant pleat 28. For example, these pleats 28 may be spaced apart from 10.16 to 15.24 cm and they may be folded so as to project out from the tree trunk by a distance of 12.7 to 25.4 mm, as needed in the particular installations so that a well defined skirt configuration 24 is produced.In such a well defined skirt configuration the lower edge 25 Figs. 1 and 2 of the compliant, low traction strip 12 will be spaced at least 25.4 mm on average from the bark, This minimum spacing of the lower edge 25 at least 25.4 mm away frointhe trunk 20 is not critical, but this is our preferred minimum skirt flareout for providing the most difficult arrangement for foiling traverse maneuvers of the low traction barrier by gypsy moth caterpillars. This particular skirt configuration causes the lower unattached portion. of the strip 12 to flare out free away from the surface of the tree bark out of immediate reach of upward crawling caterpillars. This outwardly flaring skirt configuration 24 also advantageously effectively doubles the linear low traction slippery barrier surface per width of strip 12 across which caterpillars might traverse to ascend past the barrier. Additionally, those caterpillars descending the tree which venture out onto the slippery barrier skirt surface will find it difficult to reverse direction at the lower edge 25 of the skirt and will eventually fall off of this skirt. We have carried out a considerable number of experiments and we have discovered that certain thin gauge compliant material or substrate materials which have been specially coated advantageously exhibit. low traction slippery effects with respect to the crawling locomotion of gypsy moth caterpillars such that they actually cannot gain sufficient foothold for transporting themselves in attempting to traverse the surface of this material when it is oriented in a vertical or near vertical position. We discovered that a commercially available polymer sheet material and other specially release agent coated substrate were useful and very effective in providing the desired lowtraction properties for defeating the crawling of gypsy moth caterpillars when oriented vertically or near vertically.This commercially available polymer sheet material which is very effective and which we presently consider to have the optimum low traction characteristics in preventing traverse of gypsy moth caterpillars is vinylidene chloride vinyl chloride copolymer, sold by Dow Corning Corporation under the trademark S k film. We cannot now explain why S1URAM film exhibits such advantageous low traction surface properties when such caterpillars attempt to traverse it. Conversely, we have discovered that commercially available polyester films, commercially available polypropylene films, commercially available polyethylene films and commercially available highly polished calendered paper do not exhibit such low traction properties, because gypsy moth caterpillars can easily traverse up or down across them when oriented vertically.However, we have found that such polyester, such polypropylene, such polyethylene, and such highly polished calendered paper can be dXoW exhibit the desired low traction for gypsy moth caterpillars when they are used as a substrate and are coated with a thin coating of commercially available silicone release agents, such as are used for coating substrates for tape adhesive releases, for example such silicone release agents as SILOXRE39 E 698 and SILOXR TL 298 sold by Akrasol Corporation. The thickness of such substrates plus the thin coating of release agents thereon may range from 0.013 to 0.076 mm but it is not a critical factor as long as the required high compliance or flexibility is maintained for achieving snug, close and essentially gap free adherent attachment of the barrier to the tree or other surface. Inviting attention back to Fig. 2, it is noted that the outer surface of the strip 12 in the region of the margin 14 has no adhesive 16 so that the total area of the outer surface of the strip 12 is defined by compliant, low traction, slippery material. In the preferred example as shown in Figs. 1, 2, 5 and 6 the strip 12 including its margin 14 has an overall vertical height, i.e. the total width of this strip, in the range of 7.62 to 10.16 cm and the adhesive 16 and release tape 18 have a width of 2.54 to 3.17 cm, for example, the strip 12 is SARAN vinylidene chloride vinyl chloride copolymer film 8.9 cm wide and 0.025 mm thick, and the adhesive 16 on the margin 14 is 2.86 cm wide. Thus, the area of the strip 12 below the adhesive coated margin 14 is 6.03 cm wide. Assuming that this barrier 10 is applied in a skirt configuration as shown inFig. 5 with the lower edge 25 of the skirt 24 spaced one inch away from the tree trunk, then the skirt 24 is flared out at an acute angle of approximately 25 from vertical. It is now understood that the barrier 10 provides a highly effective barrier for preventing gypsy moth caterpillars 22 from traversing a tree trunk 20. Referring again to Fig. 5, an ascending caterpillar 22 confronted with skirt 24 must first climb up the trunk until it reaches the lower limit of the attached margin 14. Then, the caterpillar must attempt to climb downwardly and outwardly on the inner slippery, low traction surface of the skirt 24 until it reaches the lower edge 25 of the skirt. Gravity is acting on the caterpillar to pull it downwardly, at the rim 25 of the skirt 24, the caterpillar must attempt to negotiate a 1800 inversion in order to climb to the outer surface of the skirt.Then it must attempt to climb upwardly on the slippery, low traction outer skirt surface against gravitational forces acting on i until it reaches the margin 14. The caterpillar then must attempt to climb vertically upwardly on the slippery, low traction outer surface of margin 14 in order to successfully traverse the whole barrier 10. In our experimental observations it is virtually impossible for a gypsy moth caterpillar to traverse up a tree trunk past such a skirt barrier 10 and to make the above described maneuvers without falling to the ground. Thus, the skirt 24 advantageously effectively doubles the slippery surface area which the caterpillar 22 must attempt to traverse, and requires the caterpillar to make difficult maneuvers against gravitational forces. Moreover, the skirt 24 acts as an umbrella to protect its inner surface against weathering. Consequently, the inner sloping surface of the strip 12 in the skirt 24 retains its low traction slippery characteristics as a barrier against traverse by gypsy moth caterpillars for a whole season, even though the outer surface may degrade somewhat over a period of weather exposure of a month or more with respect to its initial low traction properties. When a caterpillar on the trunk above the barrier 10 attempts to traverse it downwardly, the caterpillar must perform the same maneuvers described above, except in reverse order.Again, in our experimental observations it is virtually impossible that a descending caterpillar can negotiate the skirt 24 without falling. Once the caterpillar falls, the skirt prohibits its ascent up the tree trunk to the foliage 30. By positioning the barrier 10 on the trunk 20 of a tree below the foliage 30, caterpillars 22 are prevented from reaching that foliage and destroying it. The embodiment of the invention illustrated inFigs. 3 and 4 is similar to that of Figs. 1, 2, 5 and 6.Corresponding reference numerals are used to designate corresponding elements of this low traction barrier 10A. The low traction strip 12 of Figs. 3 and 4 includes both its first and second margins 14 and 14A coated with self sticking adhesive material 16 extending longitudinally along the margin. A release tape 18 is removably applied over the adhesive material 16 along both margins. In use, the low traction barrier 10A of Figs. 3 and 4 is wrapped around the circumference of a tree trunk and affixed thereto by pressing both the adhesive coated lower longitudinal margin 14A and the adhesive coated upper longitudinal margin 14 of the compliant, low traction strip 12 firmly and snuggly in gap free conformity against the bark of the tree trunk. The strip 12 thus forms a low traction barrier oriented substantially vertically. In order to traverse this low traction barrier a caterpillar must climb vertically upwardly across the entire width of the outer surface of the strip 12. By virtue of the fact that the outer surface of the barrier 10A is formed entirely from slippery, low traction material, it is virtually impossible in our experience for a gypsy moth caterpillar to traverse it without falling.It is also possible to affix the strip 12 to the tree tunk with slack in the vertical direction and pleated margins 14 and 14A in the horizontal direction. In this manner, the outer surface of the strip 12 will be undulated, thereby rendering it even more difficult to traverse for a caterpillar. We presently consider the embodiment 10 of Figs. 1, 2, 5 5 and 6 to be the very best low traction barrier, because it requires less adhesive 16 and less release tape 18 than the embodiment lOA and yet it provides almost double the effective low traction surface which must be traversed. Moreover, the low traction barrier 10 in its skirt configuration acts as an umbrella for maintaining its inner surface in unweathered condition for a whole season and in a most difficult configuratic to traverse. The embodiment 10A is also extremely effective, and they both are far and away superior, inner view, to any other caterpillar barrier presently known. In summary, the embodiments of the present invention discussed above provide effective methods and apparatus for preventing gypsy moth caterpillars and other similar crawling insects from traversing a tree trunk or other vertically oriented objects. The invention advantageously 1 Provides a barrier method that does not requireThe handling or introduction of chemical pesticides into the envir n ment. 2 Provides a non sticky outer surface 2drlih4t consequently does not loose effectiveness because of entrapment of insects or dirt and debris in the sticky outer surface. 3 Provides method and apparatus for caterpillar migration control that does not interfere with non target beneficial insects or other forest wildlife. 4 Provides a barrier that does not injure, mar, or promote injury to trees during its use. 5 Provides a barrier using a polymeric film s unique low traction slippery surface properties vis a vis gypsy moth caterpillars and using the unique slip properties of release agent coating materials on substates vis a vis such caterpillars not previously investigated for nor applied to the construction of a barrier for caterpillar control. 6 Provides a barrier employing a novel low traction skirt design that nearly doubles.the low tracticn Slippery barrier distance presented for traversing to the crawling insect as compared with the traversing distance of other typical barrier type bands of the same width. 7 Provides a barrier employing a skirt design presenting a particularly difficult low traction barrier configuratio to ascending caterpillars. 8 Provides umbrella like protection for the undersurface of the skirt. Thus, weathering exposure to the effects of rain, dust and dirt and their deleterious effects on The functioning low traction Slippery undersurface are considerably more limited during a season in comparison to other banding devices. 9 Upward migrating caterpillars encounter the lowtraction barrier and are prevented from further ascent up the tree, and those which do attempt a traverse end up falling off.Downward migrating caterpillars which venture onto the lowtraction surface slip off of it and are thereafter prevented from reascending. The discussions of the embodiments of the invention herein have been intended to be illustrative and not restrictive of the scope of the invention, that scope being defined by the following claims and all equivalents thereto.
