# Speech networks for telephone sets.

## Abstract
A speech network 11 for a telephone set is provided including a receiver 27 circuit and a transmitter 60 circuit connected in parallel between a tip lead 16 and a ring lead 17 the tip lead 16 and ring lead 17 being connected to a telephone line 1,2 . An amplifying transistor Q4 can be connected in either of two modes, including a normal receive mode for amplifving received signals from the line 1,2 and applying the amplified receive signal to the receiver 27 circuit. A voice operated switching unit Q6,20 is provided for sensing a voice signal output from the transmitter 60 circuit and connecting the transistor Q4 in a transmit mode, in which the transistor amplifies the transmitter 60 circuit output for transmission to the line 1,2 . A sidetone generating circuit R31,Q5 is connected in parallel with the receiver 27 circuit in the transmit node, for applying a reduced portion of the amplified transmit signal to the receiver 27 circuit.
