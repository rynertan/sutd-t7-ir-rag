# SERVO CONTROL CIRCUIT

## Abstract
A drive unit 54 for unidirectionally rotating a shutter 48 with the same velocity profile to open and close the shutter aperture during each exposure period is controlled by a servo control circuit. The servo control circuit includes a feedback control loop 91 configurable for either position or velocity control of the shutter 48 as determined by a control command.
