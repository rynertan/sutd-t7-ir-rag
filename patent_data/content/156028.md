Alternatively, the polyetherimides can be prepared by melt polymerization of any of the above dianhydrides with any of the above diamino compounds while heating the mixture of the inqredients at elevated temperatures with concurrent intermixing. Generally,melt polymerization temperatures between about 2000C to 400eC. and preferably 230 C to 300eC. can be employed.The conditions of the reaction and the proportions of ingredients can be varied widely depending on the desired molecular weight, intrinsic viscosity, and solvent resistance. In general, euimolar amounts of diamine and dianhydride are employed for high molecular weight polyetherimides, however, in certain instances, a slight molar excess about 1 to 5 mole percent of diamine can be employed resulting in the production of polyetherimides having terminal amine groups. Generally, useful polyetherimides have an intrinsic viscosity greater than 0.2 deciliters per gram, preferahly 0.35 to 0.60, or 0.7 deciliters per gram or even higher when measured in m cresol at 25 C. Included in the many methods of making the polyetherimides are those disclosed in U.S. Patent toHeath et al. 3,847,867, Williams 3,847,869, Takekoshi et al. 3,850,885, White 3,852,242 and 3,855,178, etc. These disclosures are incorporated herein in their entirety by reference for the purpose of teaching, by way of illustration, general and specific methods for preparing polyetherimides suitable for the blends of this invention. The ASS polysulfone component of the Dresent novel blends is a blend of a thermoplastic Dolysulfone plastic and an acrylonitrile butadiene styrene ABS Dlastic. The ABS plastic is a copolymer prepared by graft copolymerizing resin forming monomers, namely, styrene and acrylonitrile, on a previously prepared polybutadiene rubber spine, or a butadiene styrene copolymer rubber spine in the final qraft copolymer the resinous portion and the rubbery portion are believed to be in large part chemically combined. Since the ABS material has both a rubbery component e.g., polybutadiene or butadiene styrene spine or butadiene acrylonitrile copolymer component and a resinous component styrene acrylonitrile , it may therefore be regarded as a gum plastic type of material. Usually the proportion of the rubbery component in the ABS is from 5 to 35 , while the proportion of resin is correspondingly from 95 to 65ç. The overall proportion of acrylonitrile, butadiene and styrene usually falls within the ranges 10 to 40 acrylonitrile 5 to 65 . butadiene and 25 to 85 styrene. The second component of the ABS polysulfone is a polysulfone resin component which may be described as a polyarylene polyether polysulfone, which is a linear thermoplasti c reaction product of an alkali metal double salt of a dihydric phenol and a dihalobenzenoic compound, either or both of which contain a sulfone linkage SO2 between arylene groupings, to provide sulfone units in the polymer chain in addition to arylene units and ether units. Such polysulfones are included within the class of polyarylene polyether resins described in U.S. Pat.3,264,536, Robinson et al., Auq. 2, 196, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. These ABS polysulfone and methods for their preparation are described for example by Inguili et al.,U.S. Patent 3,555,119, which is incorporated herein by reference. A preferred ABS polysulfone for use in the blends of this invention is commercially available from U.S.S. Chemicals Co., Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, under the trademark, ArylonT. Any proportion of polyetherimide can be employed, and the above mentioned improvements in physical properties are generally observed in the entire ranqe of polyetherimide concentrations. Thus, modified ABSpolysulfones containing from about 1 to about 99 by weight polyetherimide based on the weight of the ABSpolysulfone polyetherimide blend are included within the present invention. For economic reasons, blends containing less than about 50 by weight polyetherimides are generally preferred. Particularly preferred blends contain from about 5 by weight to about 30 by weight polyetherimide. It has also surprisingly been found that impact strengths can be improved over those of either the ABSpolysulfone or polyetherimides alone. Such improved impact strengths are observed over a relatively narrow range of concentrations, wherein the ratio of ABSpolysulfone to polyetherimide is from about 1 99 by wt. to about 7 93 by wt. The blends of this invention can be made simply by mixinq the solid components and extruding them at elevated temperatures. Extrusion temperatures in excess of the glass transition temperatures of each of the components are typically employed. Such temperatures can range from about 3100C to about 3304C. The blends of the present invention may be injection molded at temperatures of about 315C and mold temperatures of about 80 C. Example Several samples of polyetherimide and ABSpolysulfone were blended and extruded. For samples 1, ,2 and 8, the extruder profile was set at 3 32 332 330 327J327 C with the die temperature at 327 C. For samples 3, A, 5, 6 and 7, the extruder profile was set at 316 321 36 313 310 C., with the die temperature at 310 C. The extrudates were chopped into pellets and subsequently injection molded at 316 C and subjected to a series of tests as indicated by the following chart.
