## Description
Method of detecting foreign matters mixed in a liquid contained in transDarent receptacles and apparatus relevant thereto.The present invention relates to a method of detecting foreign matters mixed in a liquid contained in a transparent receptacle, coupled with an apparatus relevant thereto. To be more precise, it relates to a method of detecting undesirable, minute foreign matters that might be present within an air tight transparent receptacle such as amples filled with liquid medicine, as well as an apparatus relevant thereto.Heretofore, as an art of this kind for the purpose of detecting foreign matters, there is known a method employing an apparatus which is devised as follows transparent receptacle filled with a liquid are placed at regular intervals on the periphery of a turnable which rotates continuously as elucidated later on, and these receptacles are brought to a sudden stop after turning at high speed on the turntable during its rotation, whereby foreign matters mixed in the liquid are made to float rays of light are applied to each of the thus stopped receptacles at almost a right angle by means of a projector which is installed outside the receptacle and repeats reciprocating motion of rapidly returning after moving by a fixed distance synchronously with the receptacle, and the flux of light transmitted to the outside of the receptacle is received by the ray receiving surface of a ray receiver which is installed on the opposite side of the projector relative to the receptacle and moves synchronously with the projector thus, when there occurs any decrease in the amount of light in respect of the image formed on the ray receiving surface due to interruption of the light by foreign matters in the course of its transmission through the liquid, it is to be detected and the presence of foreign matters is thereby detected. In an apparatus of this type, the projector is provided with a condenser lens for projecting parallel rays to the receptacle, while the ray receiver is provided with a focusing lens for focusing that parallel rays transmitted through the receptacle. As a focusing lens for this purpose, a lens set for use in ordinary cameras as lens system that displays a sufficient resolution even on minute foreign matters having a particle size of 50 p or thereabouts has been used.In this context, said focusing lens is required to be capable of not only forming a distinct image of minute foreign matters on the rayreceiving area but catching the whole flux of light given out from a light source and transmitted through the receptacle to make the brightness of the background as high and uniform as possible in order to improve the inspecting sensitivity, and therefore it has hitherto been unavoidable to employ a focusing lens having an aperture larger than the depth of the liquid within the receptacle.As a consequence, the prior art is defective in that, though it is possible to perform the inspection by the use of an ordinary lens set of about 40 mm in aperture having a forcal distance of, for instance, f55 Fl.4 in the case of amples of 2 m or 5 mQ, it is extremely difficult ot materialize a focusing lens having a sufficient resolution on minute foreign matters and an adequate aperture for use in inspection a receptacle wherein the depth of the liquid as 100 mm or more, usch as 500 mt liquid supply bottle.Besides, the prior art is defective in that, employment of a focusing lens having a large aperture necessitates provision of a considerably wide space between the focusing lens and the ray receiving surface, entailing requirement for enlargement of the ray receiver as a whole that is not only difficult to design but apt to cause oscillation of the apparatus at the time of reciprocating motion during the inspection and bring about blurring of the re sulting image. To be more precise, in the case where a lens having a focal distance of 135 mm, for instance, is employed, in order to obtain an equimultiplied image, it is necessary to make the distance between the receptacle and the lens and that between the lens and the ray receiving surface twice longer than the foregoing focal distance, or 270 mm.Accordingly, the distance between the receptacle and the ray receiving surface is required to be 540 mm and the size of the resulting ray receiver becomes large, entailing the foregoing defects.Moreover, in the case of a transparent receptacle whose bottom makes a right angle with the side wall thereof, when parallel rays are projected to the receptacle at almost a right angle as in the foregoing, the incident rays are refracted at a large angle by the bottom of receptacle to hamper the transmission of flux of light through the liquid within the bottom portion, entailing a defect that foreign matters which might be present in said portion can not be detected.One object of the present invention is to provide a method of detecting foreign matters mixed in a liquid filled in transparent receptacles and an apparatus relevant thereto, which can eliminate the afore described defects of conventional detecting methods and apparatuses, make it posse ble to receive uniformly flux of light coming through any portion of the receptacle even when the size of receptacle is enlarged, never bring about difference of brightness of the resulting image according to the portions of receptacle, and contribute to making the apparatus compact.According to the present invention, the foregoing object can be achieved by providing a method and a relevant apparatus which are so devised that the flux of light projected to a receptacle from a projecting means installed outside the receptacle and transmitted through the receptacle and a liquid contained therein in the same way as in the prior art can be transferred to a ray re cC ving surface through a multiplicity of light focusing glass fibers provided within a ray receiving means unlike the prior art.Another object of the present invention is to provide a method of detecting foreign matters mixed in a liquid filled in transparent receptacles and an apparatus relevant thereto, which are so devised that the flux of light can be transmitted through a liquid within a transparent receptacle even in the case where the bottom of said receptacle makes a right angle with the side wall thereof and the thus transmitted flux of light can be received by the light focusing glass fibers of a ray receiving means and transferred to the ray receiving surface.According to the present invention, the foregoing object can be achieved by providing an apparatus which is devised such that rays of light are to be projected aslant from a projecting means toward the bottom portion of the receptacle and light focusing glass fibers of a ray receiving means are disposed on the opposite side of the thus slanted projecting means relative to the receptacle in such a manner as to make the optic axes of said rays of light agree with the optic axis of the transmittel flux of light outside the receptacle. A further object of the present invention is to provide a method and an apparatus relevant thereto which are capable of exactly detecting the presence of foreign matters mixed in a liquid with almost the same clearness whether they be in the central portion or the peripheral portion of the receptacle even when the receptacle is considerably largesized.According to the present invention, the foregoing object can be achieved by providing an apparatus which is devised such that a couple of inspection sets, each set consisting of projecting means and ray receiving means, are so arranged as to make fellow projecting means and fellow ray receiving means of each set form a V shape respectively, the optic axes of flux of light in the respective sets cross each other at the center of the receptacle, and the focal distances of the light focusing glass fibers of the ray receiving means in each set vary with the use for inspection of the central portion and the use for inspection of the peripheral portion of the receptacle.The exact nature of the present invention, as well as other objects and advantages thereof, will be readily apparent from consideration of the following specification relating to the accompanying drawings, in which like reference characters designate the same or similar parts throughout the figures thereof.Figure 1 is an illustration for explaining the optical properties of the light focusing glass fibers,Figure 2 is a plan of the whole of an embodiment of the foreign matter detecting apparatus according to the present invention,Figure 3 is an enlarged cross section of the apparatus shown in Fig. 2 as partially cut vertically along lineIII III thereof,Figure 4 is an enlarged detail plan of a part of the illustration in Fig. 2,Figure 5 is an enlarged cross section of the figure shown in Fig. 4 as partially cut vertically along the line V V thereof.In the embodiment of the present invention illustrated inFigs. 2 through 5, parts other than the projectors 17 and 17 and the ray receivers 18 and 18 in the first inspection means 9 and the second inspection means 11 belong to well known arts. Therefore, some of them that are of no particular importance are herein omitted from illustration, and also as to other well known parts than the above de fined, explanation thereof will be simplified.First, the well known parts in the present embodiment will be explained.Referring to Figs. 2 and 2, the reference numeral 1 denotes a screw feeder which supplies receptacles loaded on a belt conveyor 2 to a star wheel 3. The receptacles 50 supplied to the niches of the star wheel 3 are guided by a guide plate 4 with the rotation of the star wheel 3 to be supplied to seats 6 of a turntable 5.The turntable 5 rotates continuously and synchronously with the star wheel 3, and the receptacles 50 supplied to the seats 6 of this turntable 5 are firmly held by caps 7 which hang in vertically movable fashion from a supporting plate 47 mounted on posts 46 erected on the turntable 5. On the periphery of the turntable 5 there are installed the first turning means for receptacle 8, the first inspection means 9, the second turning means for receptacle 10 and the second inspection means 11, and the first and second turning means for receptacle are respectively provided with a motor 12, a pulley 13 and a belt 14. This belt 14 comes in contact with a pulley 15 fixed on the supporting shaft of the seat 6 supported on the turntable 5 in rotatable fashion, and rotates the receptacle 50 at high speed.The first and second inspection means 9 and 11 are respectively equipped with a projector 17 and a ray receiver 18.This projector 17 is, as illustrated in Figs. 3 and 5, provided with a lens case 42 which accommodates condenser lenses 31, 31 disposed in the front part thereof and projection heads 30 disposed in the rear part thereof to confront the respective lenses. This lens case 42 is disposed outside the turntable 5 and mounted on a case seat 44 fixed on the upper end of an I shaped arm 36 which projects sideways from a shaft 35 installed in rotatable fashion relative to the turntable 5. Meanwhile, the projection head 30 is connected to a lamp 28 through a light transmit means 29. The thus devised projector 17 is disposed almost horizontally so as to be capable of projecting rays of light in almost normal direction toward the receptacle 50.The ray receiver 18 is installed on a seat 38 mounted on a table 37 fixed to the upper end of a shaft 35 and is so devised that the position thereof can be freely adjusted both forward and backward by virtue of engagement of slits 39 and bolts 40 cf. Fig. 4 .The above described projector and ray receiver are disposed to be opposite to each other with a receptacle 50 supported on the turntable 5 between them.Further, between the first turning means for receptacle 8 and the first inspection means 9 there is provided a brake 19 for the purpose of bringing the receptacle 50 rotating as shown in Fig. 4 to a halt as it comes in contact with the pulley 15. Accordingly, when a receptacle held by a cap 7 disposed thereabove reaches the first turning means for receptacle 8 with the rotation of the turntable 5, the belt 14 and the pulley 15 come in contact with each other and rotate at high speed, whereby the receptacle 50 rotates together with the seat 6. When the receptacle passes through the firstiurning means for receptacle 8, the brake 19 comes in contact with the pulley 15 and brings the seat 6 to a halt. At this, the receptacle also comes to a halt, but minute foreign matters mixed in the liquid contained therein keep floating.When the receptacle reaches the first inspection means 9, the table 37 moves synchronously with the turntable 5 by virtue of a reciprocating device not shown in the drawings and accordingly the projector 17 and the ray receiver 18 move together with the receptacle 50, whereby in spection of the content of receptacle is performed.This inspection has been explained in detail in Japanese Xaid Open Patent Application No. 139597 1978 submitted previously by the applicant of the present invention. To give an epitome of the inspection hereunder, the flux of light transmitted through the receptacle 50 is focused by a focusing lens not shown herein and is formed into an image on a bundle of optical fibers that forms a rayreceiving surface disposed in the rear of said lens. The thus formed image is then transferred by way of said bundle of optical fibers to photoelectric elements disposed in the rear thereof, and by observing increase and decrease of the luminous intensity through the output from the photoelectric element the presence of foreign matters is to be detected.When the inspection is completed in this way, the first inspection means 9 returns rapidly to tis former position and performs inspection of the suxeeding receptacles. The receptacle 50 subjected to the first inspection further moves with rotation of the turntable 5 and undergoes the second inspection by the second inspection means 11 in the same way as the first inspection by way of the second turning means 10.Based on the results of the foregoing first and second inspections, the receptacles filled with a liquid 50 are classified into qualified goods and inferior goods by a succeeding selecting means 20 cf. Fig. 2 . Transfer of said receptacles 50 from the turntable 5 to this selecting means 20 is performed by a delivery star wheel 21, whose structure is the same as that of the aforesaid star wheel 3, together with the guide plate 22.The selecting means 20 is equipped with a damper 25 for the purpose of sifting inferior goods to be sent a delivery portion for inferior goods 23 from qualified goods to be sent to a delivery portion for qualified goods 24 with respect to the respectacles 50 transported by th,J conveyor 2, and this damper 25 works in accordance with instructions from the inspection means 9 and 11.The delivery portion for qualified goods 24 comprises a guide plate 26 and a turntable 27.The foregoing processes of the conventional method of detecting foreign matters are admittedly to be followed in the present invention in almost the same manner, but the point of difference between the method proposed in the present invention and the conventional method relates to the construction of the projector and ray receiver as well as the disposition thereof, so this characteristic of the present invention will be hereunder elucidated by reference to the embodiment illustrated in the accompanying drawings.Referring to Figs. 3 through 5, the first and second inspection means 9 and 11 are respectively provided with another projector 17 in addition to the aNore described projector 17, said projector 17 being of the same construction, having optic axis of rays of light emitted from the projector 17 at the center of the receptacle 50 and being so disposed as to form a V shape with the projector 17 relative to said center of receptacle. In concert with this provision of projector 17 , another ray receiver 18 having the same construction as the ray receiver 18 for the purpose of receiving the flux of light emitted from the projector 17 is os disposed as to form aV shape with the ray receiver 18 relative to the center of receptacle.The purpose in providing two sets of inspection means consisting of projector and ray receiver as set forth above is to facilitate the inspection of the central portion of the receptacle 50 by means of one set consisting of,for instance, the projector 17 and the ray receiver 18 and the inspection of the peripheral portion of the receptacle 50 by means of the other set consisting of the projector 17 and the ray receiver 18 . In this respect further elucidation will be made later on.As regards the projectors 17 and 17 , the construction of a portion thereof is different from that of the aforesaid conventional one. This point of difference lies in that, as seen from Fig. 5, one projection head 30 is disposed almost horizontally relative to the receptacle 50 like the conventional one, while the other projection head 30 is disposed aslant downward, preferably in such a manner as to make the optic axis of rays of light pass through the lens 31 aslant downward at an angle of about 150 relative to a horizontal level. By so disposing, it becomes possible to inspect the bottom portion of the receptacle 50 in concert with the ray receivers 18 and 18 described below.Further, in the ray receivers 18 and 18 , in lieu of a single focusing lens employed for the conventional ray receiver, a multiplicity of light focusing glass fibers 45 and 45 as disposed parallel to one another cf. Fig.5 are set within a frame 32 to thereby construct focusing lenses 33 and 33 , and the lens 37, is disposed face to face with the projection head 30 while the lens 33 is disposed face to face with the projection head 30 . And, at a fixed distance S in the rear of these lenses 33 and 33 there is provided a ray receiving surface 34 like in the prior art and further in the rear of this ray receiving surface there are provided photoeledric elements not shown in the drawing as accommodated in a casing 41.The foregoing light focusing glass fiber 45 is a kind of unistructural glass fiber popular under the trade name Selfoc, and the radial refractive index of the rays of light transmitted lengthwise is to change continuously excepting that the rays of light incident upon the optic axis are to go straight on. Accordingly, as illustrated in Fig. 1, in the case of objects X, Y, Z located in different positions on the optic axis, rays of light projected from these objects mender along the optic axis to come to form an image respectively at different places along the lengthwise direction of the optic axis, such as denoted by X , Y , Z . Therefore, by the use of this glass fiber 45 cut into pieces of an appropriate length, there can be provided a lens having a focal distance corresponding to said length.Also, by virtue of arranging such pieces in proportion to the length of field of vision, there can be provided a lens having a wide field of vision or a lens having a short focal distance while being capable of fun ioning like conventional lenses of large aperture.In the foregoing embodiment, by virtue of utilizing the optical characteristics of said optical fiber 45 such as described above, it also has become possible to perform inspection of the central portion and the peripheral portion of a receptacle separately as stated above.For example, in the case of a receptacle 50 having a large diameter such as liquid supply bottles containing 200 mL, 500 m and the like, detection of foreign matters floating in the peripheral portion of the receptacle can not be performed satisfadDrily by merely focusing on one point of the central portion thereof. In view of this fact, two sets of projectors and ray receivers are installed as above, and at the time of inspecting the central portion by the ray receiver 18 and the peripheral portion by the ray receiver 18 with respect to a receptacle containing, for instance, 500 m of liquid, as optical fiber 45 for the former receiver 18, fibers having a length corresponding to f50 mm are employed, while as optical fiber 45 for the latter receiver 18 , fibers having a length corresponding of f50 mm are employed. The result of detection conducted by the use of the thus devised apparatus has proved very satisfacotry.Although a particular preferred embodiment of the invention has been discolsed in detail for illustrative purposes, it will be recognized that variations or modifications of the disclosed apparatus, including the arrangement of parts, lie within the scope of the present invention.
