# Tuning circuit incorporating a frequency synthesizer circuit.

## Abstract
In a frequency synthesizer circuit comprising a digital to analogue converter 90, 87 for converting a difference measured between a frequency determined by a tuning data signal source 29 and the frequency of an oscillator 97 whose frequency is controllable by a control signal, the digital to analogue converter 90, 87 is arranged for only pulse duration modulation 39, 41, 45, 55 of a periodically occurring pulse pattern, from 85 above a predetermined minimum value Δ fmin of the difference measured and for only amplitude modulation 61, 67, 79 of the entire pulse pattern below a predetermined maximum value Δ fmax of the difference measured.
