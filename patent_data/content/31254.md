# METHOD OF FORMING METAL CANS

## Abstract
This relates to a method of forming metal cans wherein two generally cup shaped halves have their open ends united to form such cans. This particularly relates to the forming of can components at a central facility where the can compo nents are formed in great numbers and are then shipped to a place of use. This particularly relates to the forming of tapered can components which are readily nested for stacking, wrap ped, and then shipped to a satellite facility where the tapered can components are reshaped to have cylindrical bodies and domed ends and wherein the domed cup shaped can halves are then assembled by way of a pressure tight seam between the can halves.
