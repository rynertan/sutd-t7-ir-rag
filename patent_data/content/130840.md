# ALIGNMENT PIN FOR GUIDE TUBE ASSEMBLY IN NUCLEAR POWER PLANT REACTOR VESSEL

## Abstract
Guide tube alignment pins are secured to a flange at the lower end of a guide tube of a nuclear power plant reactor ves sel. They extend downwardly from the flange and enter open ings in an upper core plate of a guide tube assembly as the guide tube is lowered into place to align the center of the guide tube with the center of the fuel bundle or fuel element so that the cluster control rod in the guide tube can enter the fuel bundle with the least amount of drag and in the proper time. The guide tube alignment pins include guide fingers at the lower portions thereof which enter the openings in the upper core plate for positioning the center of the guide tube over the center of the associated fuel bundle or fuel element. Intermediate the ends thereof, the guide tube alignment pins are formed with a Morse taper to increase the width of the shanks at the areas subject to frequent fractures. A locking device at the top of the guide tube alignment pins, which is integrally formed with a locking cup, is crimped for securement of the upper ends of the guide tube alignment pins to the flange at the lower end of the guide tube. Guide tube alignment pins have been made of Ni Cr Fe al loy X 750. To reduce stress corrosion cracking of the guide tube alignment pins, the guide tube alignment pins are heat treated by solution annealing at 2000 F 50 F for a mini mum of one hour and then cooling to ambient temperature. This procedure is followed by heating the guide tube alignment pins at 1300 F 50 F for approximately twenty hours and then cooling to ambient temperature.
