## Description
This invention relates to an optical data card for carrying out optical recording and a process for preparing the same. There is an optical recording playback system wherein a thin film of low melting metals such as tellurium and bismuth is provided on a substrate, the laminate is irradiated with a laser beam or the like to change a portion of the thin film to carry out recording, and the recorded information is subjected to optical playback. Such an optical recording playback system has an advantage that the recorded information density is dramatically higher as compared with that of prior art magnetic systems, and IC systems examined in recent years. However, in the optical recording playback system described above, a laser beam is used and therefore high technology is required in controlling the laser beam. Further, the optical recording playback system is unsuitable for mass production. Particularly, in order to apply the optical recording playback system to cards which are issued in a large amount ID cards such as bank s cash cards and credit cards , it is required to develop materials and systems which are cheaper and suitable for mass production. Further, the deposition of soil onto recorded portions, and the damage of the recorded portions are undesirable in optical playback from the standpoint of high recording density. US 4304848 discloses that optical data disks may be produced by photo etching thin aluminium or chromium layers coated on disk substrates. WO82 02968 discloses a bank card which includes, on a card substrate, a direct read after write material comprising a thin light reflective metallic film. Information is written on the material using a laser. In WO84 02201 a similar material is disclosed where the metallic film is provided by silver particles in a gelatin matrix. The matrix includes a portion with high reflectivity silver particles as a laser recording material and a portion with low reflectivity silver particles forming photographic visual images. The present invention provides an optical data card comprising a card substrate and a light reflective layer, The present invention also provides a process for producing the above optical data card wherein the following steps i and ii are carried out in any order i the step of forming a surface cured layer 6 on one surface of a protective film 5 , and ii the step of forming an optical lower reflection layer 4a , and optical higher reflection layer 4b and a photoresist layer 7 on a card substrate in this order, and thereafter subjecting the laminate to photetching thereby to record an optical information pattern in only the optical higher reflection layer 4b and then said protective film 5 and said laminate are bonded so that the free surface of said protective film 5 and the optical higher reflection layer 4b provided on said card substrate are in face to face relationship. As shown in FIG. 1, an optical data card of the present invention fundamentally comprises a card substrate 1 and a light reflective layer 4 provided on the card substrate 1 wherein said light reflective layer 4 has an optical information pattern 3 formed therein. The light reflective layer 4 further comprises a light reflective metallic thin film 4b having a uniform phase and an optical lower reflection layer 4a . Materials from which each layer is produced, functions thereof and the like will be described hereinafter. The card substrate 1 supports a card at a bottom position. Other recording means may be applied as needed. Materials from which the card substrate 1 is produced may generally be the same as those of cards of conventional magnetic systems. Accordingly, rigid polyvinyl chloride resins are usually used. In order to apply color or to carry out printing, white polyvinyl chloride resins are usually used. The reason why the polyvinyl chloride resins are selected is not a critical reason. Other synthetic resins can also be used. Other materials may be used provided that the card substrate is in the form of a sheet. If resistance to bending is required, metallic plates, metallic nets, woven fabrics or nonwoven fabrics may be used to reinforce the resins. Further, the card substrate may be a laminate composed of a plurality of layers. Examples of recorded means other than light recording means applied to the card substrate 1 include hologram, imprint embossing , photographs of face, engraving, signs, IC chips, bar codes, and general printing. These may be used in combination. Alternatively, if interchangeability with cards of magnetic systems is considered, a magnetic recording layer can also be provided. The adhesive layer 2 adheres the card substrate 1 to overlying layers. If the size of the light reflective layer 4 having the light information pattern 3 recorded therein is smaller than that of the protective film 5, the protective film 5 and the card substrate 1 may adhere. Accordingly, adhesives of the adhesive layer 2 are selected by considering materials from which the card substrate 1 is produced, materials from which the light reflective layer 4 is produced, and further usually materials from which the protective film 5 is produced. Examples of the adhesives include epoxy, urethane, acrylic and cyanoacrylate adhesives. Materials from which the light reflective layer 4 is produced are Cr, Ti, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Ag, Au, Ge, Al, Mg, Sb, Te, Pb, Pd, Cd, Bi, Sn, Se, In, Ga, Rb and the like. These components can be used alone or in combination i.e., alloys . Among these components, Al, Cr, Ni, Ag and Au are preferable from the standpoints of light reflectivity and durability. The thickness of the light reflective layer 4 composed of a thin film of metals or alloys is from 0.02 1µm 200 A to 10,000 A , preferrably from 0,1 0,5 1,000 A to 5,000 A . The light reflective layer 4 is formed from the following metals or alloys by means such as vapor deposition, sputtering, CVD, ion plating, molecular beam epitaxy and plating. Examples of the metals include 1 metals having excellent light reflectivity such as Al, Ni, Cr, Ag and Au. These metal based alloys can be used. When the metals or alloys belonging to this group are used, the optical contrast between the pit portions and pit free portions of the resulting light records is high, and therefore its readout is readily carried out. Examples of the other metals include 2 low melting metals such as Te, Zn, Pb, Cd, Bi, Sn, Se, In, Ga, and Rb. These metal based alloys can be also used. Examples of the preferred alloys include Te Se, Te Se Pb, Te Pb, Te Sn S, Sn Cu, and Te Cu Pb. When the wavelength of a laser beam for readout is at least 650 nm, a Te Cu alloy containing from 5 to 40 atomic percent of Cu or a Te Cu Pb alloy containing from 5 to 40 atomic percent of Cu and from 1 to 50 atomic percent of Pb based on the weight of Cu has a high optical contrast between pit portions and pit free portions, and thus readout is readily carried out. Examples of the metal materials which can be used include compounds which occur phase transition by irradiating with a laser beam or the like to change their light reflectivity, for example, Te oxides, Sb oxides, Mo oxides, Ge oxides, V oxides, Sn oxides, Te oxide Ge, and Te Sn. Thin films of composite materials of the above metal and an organic or inorganic compound such as Te CH₄, Te CS₂, Te Styrene, Sn SO₂, GeS Sn, and SnS S, or multilayer films such as SiO₂ Ti SiO₂ Al can be used as a reflective metallic thin film which constitutes the light reflective layer. Further, optomagnetic recording materials such as GdCo, TbCo, GdFe, DyFe, GdTbFe, GdFeBi, TbDyFe and MnCuBi can be used as the material for the reflective metallic thin film. The reflective mettallic thin films of various types as described above can also be used in combination. The multilayer films of metals or alloys as described above such as a multilayer film of an In film and a Te film can be used as the light reflective layer. The optical information pattern 3 comprises a series of the recesses formed in the light reflective layer 4 or a series of holes which penetrate the light reflective layer 4. The plane form of the recesses or holes these are referred to as pits is circle, ellipse, rectangle, square or the like. The size obtained by measuring their diameter or length of major axis or long side is usually from about 2 to about 200 µm. The distance between centers of adjacent pits is usually from 5 to 500 µm. As shown in FIG. 1, the light reflective layer comprises an optical lower reflection layer 4a and an optical higher reflection layer 4b provided thereon. In this case, it is desirable that the adhesive layer 2 be interposed between the protective film and the light reflective layer. The optical lower reflection layer 4a has a lower light reflectivity as compared with that of the optical higher reflection layer 4b. Desirably, the optical lower reflection layer 4a has a black color. The layer having rough surfaces exhibits the diffused reflection of light and therefore it shows low reflectivity. Accordingly, such a layer having rough surfaces can be used. The optical lower reflection layer 4a can be formed by a printing or coating method wherein an ink composition having a high optical density is used. It is preferable that the plane form of the light reflective layer 4 be an island form as shown in FIG. 2, i.e., a form wherein the ends of the light reflective layer do not come into contact with the ends of the card. The use of such a form not only excludes the contact with the air to improve corrosion resistance but also improves the aesthetic properties of the card. The protective film 5 directly protects the light reflective layer 4 in the state of the card. When the light reflective layer is smaller than the card substrate, the presence of the protective film only on the light reflective layer 4 is sufficient from the standpoint of the protection of the light reflective layer. However, it is desirable that the surface of the card be flat and the surface protection of the portions having no light reflective layers 4 may be necessary. Accordingly, it is desirable that the size of the protective film be the same as that of the optical card. Characteristics required for the protective film 5 are high transparency, smoothness, and uniform thickness. An example of the most preferred protective film is a film of a polycarbonate resin its refrective index 1.58 . The thickness of this film is from about several micrometers to about 800 µm. Examples of other preferred protective films are films of resins such as cellulose resins e.g., cellulose triacetate resins polyethylene terephthalate resins acrylic resins such as polymethyl methacrylate resins polyvinyl chloride resins polysulfone resins such as polyethersulfone resins and polymethyl pentene resins. In adition, other resins such as vinyl polyimide resins, polyether imide resins, polyether ketone resins and polyamide resins can be used. Materials other than the resins can be used provided they have necessary performances. Examples of such materials include glasses, ceramics, papers, plastic films, woven fabrics and nonwoven fabrics. Resin films, or glasses are preferred because they meet various requirements. The front surface and or back surface of the protective film 5 may be subjected to physical treatments such as corona discharge treatment and plasma treatment or chemical treatments such as oxidation treatment by acids and primer treatment as needed in order to improve the adhesion between the protective film and other layers laminated on the surfaces of the protective film. Printed layers may be applied to the front surface and or back surface of the protective film unless the playback of the underlying light information pattern is hindered. The surface cured layer 6 enhances the hardness of the outermost surface present on the light reflective layer 4 which is the recording portion of the optical card prevents damage during the carrying or usage of the card or prevents contamination materials from blocking in the cracks incurred in the damage and improves the durability, recording writing precision and playback readout precision of the optical card. Any materials which are used in methods known as methods of curing surfaces can be used as materials from which the surface cured layer 6 is produced unless the characteristics of the protective film are lowered. Examples of the materials from which the surface cured layer 6 is produced include curable resins such as silicone, acryl, melamine, polyurethane and epoxy resins metal oxides such as Al₂O₃ and SiO₂ and polymerized films obtained by plasma polymerization. In general, the cured film is not readily damaged, and therefore soil is not blocked in the cracked portions. Further, the cured film is chemically inert and therefore soil does not readily deposit on the surface. Even if the soil deposits, the soil is readily removed. The materials used in a process for preparing the optical data card of the present invention are the same as those already described unless otherwise indicated. A process for preparing the optical data card as shown in fig 1 includes the steps described below. In brief, a light reflective layer composed of two layers is provided on a substrate of an optical data card to form a light information pattern, and a protective film is laminated to the light reflective layer. First, a surface cured layer 6 is formed on the upper surface of a protective film 5, as shown in fig 3, using methods adapted for materials from which the surface cured layer 6 is produced. In order to form a layer of cured resin, conventional coating methods are used. In order to form a layer of metal oxide, there is utilized a method of forming a layer of metal oxides by means of sputtering or the like or another method wherein a layer of metal is formed by vapor deposition or the like and thereafter the layer of metal is oxidized. Besides this, a card substrate 1 is provided, and the optical lower reflection layer 4a is provided thereon. A method such as printing, coating, vapor deposition or lamination is utilized depending upon materials from which the layer 4a is produced. The optical higher reflection layer 4b is then provided on the optical lower reflection layer 4a. The optical higher reflection layer 4b may be formed, for example, by methods such as sputtering, vacuum deposition, ion plating, and electroplating. As shown in FIG. 4, a photoresist layer 7 for photoetching the optical higher reflection layer 4b is formed on the optical higher reflection layer 4b, and subjected to photoetching to record a light information pattern in the optical higher reflection layer 4b. Examples of the materials for forming the photoresist layer these materials are referred to as photoresist include 1 photodecomposable photosensitive resins including diazonium salts and azide compounds 2 photocrosslinking photosensitive resins such as cinnamoyl, diazo, azide and acryloyl types and 3 photopolymerizable photosensitive resins such as acrylic esters and acrylamides. Commercially available materials can be used as the photoresist. Examples of negative type photoresist materials include KPR and KOR, manufactured by Eastman Kodak WAY COAT HR, manufactured by Hunt Chemical FSR, manufactured by Fuji Yakuhin, Japan and TPR, OMR and NONCRON, manufactured by Tokyo Ohka Kogyo, Japan. Examples of positive type photoresist materials include Micro Posit 1300, manufactured by Shipley WAY COAT HRP, manufactured by Hunt Chemical OFPR, manufactured by Tokyo Ohka Kogyo, Japan and KMPR, manufactured by Eastman Kodak. Examples of dry film type photoresist materials include RISTON, manufactured by E.I. du Pont de Nemours Co. Inc. and SERITONE, manufactured by Dainichi Kako, Japan. Examples of other photoresist materials include dichromate sensitizers such as egg albumen, casein, glue, PVA and Shellac. The photoresist layer 7 is formed from the photoresist materials. The photoresist layer 7 is formed on the light reflective layer by known application methods such as flow coating, wheeler coating, spinner coating, dipping, roller coating, spraying, electrostatic spraying, and hot pressing the last method is used in the case of the dry films . The thickness of the photoresist layer is usually from 0.5 to 5.0 µm. The photoresist layer 7 is usually subjected to heating referred to as prebaking. The photoetching step is described in more detail. An optical information pattern is exposed to light, then developed to form a resist pattern, and thereafter the photoresist layer 7 free portions exposed portions 10 of the light reflective layer is etched using an etchant to form an optical information pattern in the light reflective layer. As shown in FIG. 4, the exposure of the optical information pattern is readily carried out by irradiating with ultraviolet rays 9 or the like via a pattern 8 such as a photographic film or a metallic mask. In addition, the exposure may be carried out by irradiating with an electron beam via a metallic mask. Alternatively, the exposure may be carried out by scanning an electron beam in the form of a pattern without using the pattern. The development is to dissolve and remove the soluble portions formed by the exposure, with a solvent. The development is carried out using a developing solution. As shown in FIG. 5, the portions of the photoresist layer present on the portions to be etched of the light reflective layer are removed in the form of a pattern by development to form exposed portions 10. After development, as shown in FIG. 6, the photoresist layer uncoated portions of the light reflective layer is etched using an etchant to form a light information pattern of a series of pits 11 in the optical higher reflection layer, 46. After formation of the optical information pattern, the remaining photoresist layer is removed as needed. Because 1 the step of forming the surface cured layer on one surface of the protective film, and 2 the step of laminating the light reflective layer and the photoresist layer to the other surface of the protective film and photoetching to record the optical information pattern have no relation to each other, these two steps may be carried in any order. The protective film 5 having the surface cured layer 6 is laminated to the card substrate having the optical lower reflection layer 4a and the optical higher reflection layer 4b having a recorded light information pattern via an adhesive so that the optical higher reflection layer 4b and the protective film 5 are in face to face relation. In lamination, the surface cured layer on the protective film is disposed at an upper position and the lower surface of the protective film is affixed to the card substrate. Thus, the light reflective layer present at the lower side of the protective film is situated at the inner portion of the optical data card, and therefore the light reflective layer is protected without directly touching with hands and without touching with a writing or readout instrument. As shown in FIG. 7, the lamination is carried out by applying an adhesive 2 to at least one of surfaces to be adhered, taking an open time as needed, stacking them, and pressing by pressure means 12 such as flat presses and roller presses while heating as needed to intimately adhere them. While the adhesives described above can be used, it is preferable to use adhesives having a high playback light transmittance. The optical data card having predetermined form and size is produced in the following manner. The protective film and the card substrate may be previously produced in predetermined form and size. Alternatively, the protective film and the card substrate may be produced in size larger than a predetermined size, laminated and thereafter formed into the product having predetermined form and size by punching or cutting. While the optical data card has a high recording density, it is necessary to strictly carry out the scanning of readout playback light. Thus, in photoetching the light reflective layer, a mark for punching or cutting is provided on a portion of the light reflective layer. When punching or cutting is carried out on a basis of this mark, the recording situation of the optical information pattern is strictly disposed against each side of the optical data card. Accordingly, the precision of the scanning of readout playback light is improved. This process is particularly adapted for the production of the optical data card having the structure as shown in FIG. 1. In this process, the layers 4a and 4b are intimately adhered. Suitable printing may be applied to the lower surface of the protective layer unless the light reflective layer is covered. When the optical data card of the present invention has the surface cured layer at the outermost surface, the deposition of soil and the damage are extremely little in carrying or using it. Further, when the protective film is formed, it is unnecessary that a light beam modulated for writing or readout be focused on the outermost surface, and the light beam is satisfactorily focused on the surface of the light reflective layer. Accordingly, even if the damage or soil on the surface may be present, it is possible to carry out writing or readout if the light beam can be introduced from the surrounding portions of cracks or soil. Further, according to process of the present invention, recording may be carried out without using a laser beam, and therefore high technology required for the utilization of the laser beam is unnecessary. If many materials are subjected to exposure, development and etching at a time, their mass productivity is excellent. Furthermore, light reflective layer having excellent light reflectivity and durability can be used as the light reflective layer capable of photoetching, as compared with the prior art light reflective layer capable of recording by a laser beam. In the process for preparing optical data card according to the present invention, it is preferable that the surface of the card material except for the portion to be processed be always covered with a protective sheet in order to prevent the surface thereof from being scratched. The protective sheet is prepared by applying a slightly sticky adhesive over the surface of a sheet of paper, plastic and the like, and can be readily attached to or peeled from the surface of the card material. Preferably, the protective sheet be attached to the surface of a material such as a card substrate or a product not only during the preparation of the card but also prior to and after the preparation thereof. The optical data card of the present invention can be used, for example, for the following cards. An undercoat treatment agent Primer PC 4, manufactured by Shin etsu Kagaku, Japan was applied to the front surface of a polycarbonate film having a thickness of 400 µm by a gravure method. Then, a silicone surface curing agent a 10 1 mixture of X 12 2150 A and X 12 2150 B , manufactured by Shin etsu Kagaku, Japan was applied thereon by a gravure method and heated for 30 minutes at a temperature of 100 C to form a surface cured layer. An undercoat treatment agent Tuff Coat No. 150, manufactured by Dai Nippon Ink Kagaku, Japan was applied to the back surface of the polycarbonate film described above by a gravure method, and dried for 5 minutes at a temperature of 100 C. An aluminum layer was formed thereon under 1x10 ⁵ torr by vacuum deposition. Further, a photoresist Micro Posit 1300 27, manufactured by Shipley was applied to the aluminum deposited surface described above by a gravure method and heated for 25 minutes at a temperature of 90 C. The film thickness of aluminum was 0.3 µm, and the film thickness of the photoresist was 1.0 µm. The photoresist coated surface thus formed was then brought into intimate contact with the masking surface of a photomask having a pattern formed therein, wherein dots having a length of 15 µm and a width of 5 µm were aligned at a pitch of 15 µm to form rows, wherein the pitch between rows was 20 µm and wherein the dot portions were light transmittant. The whole was exposed to ultrahigh pressure mercury lamp for 5 seconds from the side of the photomask 3 KW, and a distance of one meter . The photomask pattern used was obtained by the following photoetching method. First, a Cr thin film was formed on a glass plate to a film thickness of 3000 A by a sputtering method. A photoresist Micro posit 1300 27, manufactured by Shipley was applied to the Cr thin film by means of a spinner and dried. The surface of the photoresist was irradiated with a He Cd laser beam modulated to a beam diameter of 2 µm, on a position controlled XY stage. Thus, rows formed by aligning dots having a length of 15 µm and a width of 5 µm at a pitch of 15 µm were formed in an array of a pitch between rows of 20 µm. The photoresist was treated with a resist developing solution manufactured by Shipley and heated for 25 minutes at a temperature of 130 C. Thereafter, photoetching was carried out by a ferric chloride solution to obtain a mask pattern wherein the dot portions were light transmittant. The thus imagewise exposed photoresist layer on the polycarbonate film was then immersed in a resist developing solution manufactured by Shipley for 60 seconds and washed with water. The whole was immersed in an aluminum etchant having the following composition for 90 seconds, washed with water and then dried to obtain a pattern film having a pattern on the aluminum thin film. On the other hand, a card substrate was prepared in the following manner. First, patterns of letters and designs were provided on both surfaces of a white rigid polyvinyl chloride film having a thickness of 150 µm by a screen printing method. A magnetic recording layer having a width of 6.5 mm was provided on a portion of the front surface of a separate transparent rigid polyvinyl chloride film having a thickness of 100 µm. Its back surface and the printed white rigid polyvinyl chloride described above were stacked. The stack was interposed between two stainless steel plates and subjected to heating and pressure for 30 minutes at a temperature of 140 C by means of a pressing machine to obtain a card substrate. The thus prepared pattern film and card substrate were stacked via an epoxy resin a 10 4 mixture of Pellnox MG 150 and Pellcure HY 306, manufacture by Nippon Pellnox so that the pattern surface of the pattern film came into contact with the printed surface of the white rigid polyvinyl chloride film of the card substrate. The stack was pressed by means of a roll or the like. After pressing, the stack was allowed to stand for 24 hours and punched by means of a punching metal mold to obtain an optical card which did not interfere with writing or readout. An acrylic resin Tuff Coat, manufactured by Dai Nippon Ink Kagaku, Japan was coated onto a transparent polyester film having a thickness of 100 µm Tetoron Film O Type, manufactured by Teijin, Japan as a primer for vapor deposition by a roll coating method and then dried. An Al film having a film thickness of 200 A was formed on the primer by vapor deposition. A photoresist Micro Posit, manufactured by Shipley was applied onto the Al film by a spinner and subjected to baking for 25 minutes at a temperature of 90 C to form a photoresist layer having a film thickness of 1 µm. A photomask having information pits formed therein was then intimately stacked onto the resist layer described above. The whole was exposed to an ultrahigh presure mercury lamp 3 KW and a distance of 80 cm for 10 seconds. After exposure, the whole was immersed in a developing solution Micro Posit Developer, manufactured by Shipley to dissolve and remove the exposed portions of the photoresist. After removal, the whole was subjected to post baking for 20 minutes at a temperature of 100 C and then immersed in an etchant 16 parts of phosphoric acid, 2 parts of acetic acid, 1 part of nitric acid and 1 part of water for 3 minutes to etch and remove the exposed portions of the aluminum layer. Thus, a light reflective metallic thin film layer having patterned information pits was formed. A transparent acrylic ultraviolet curable resin UVX HM196, manufactured by Three Bond was then applied to the whole surface of the thus obtained metallic thin film layer, and then irradiated with ultraviolet rays to cure it. Thus, a thin and flexible optical recording material was obtained. An acrylic resin Tuff Coat, manufactured by Dai Nippon Ink Kagaku, Japan was coated onto a polyether sulfone film having a thickness of 14 µm manufactured by Sumitomo Bakelite, Japan as a primer for vapor deposition by a roll coating method and then dried. An Al film having a film thickness of 200 A was formed on the primer by vapor deposition. A light reflective metallic thin film layer having information pits was then formed in the Al film in the same manner as described in Example 2. A transparent acrylic ultraviolet curable resin UVX HM 196, manufactured by Three Bond was then applied to the whole surface of the thus obtained metallic thin film layer, and then irradiated with ultraviolet rays to cure it. Thus, a thin and flexible optical recording tape was obtained.
