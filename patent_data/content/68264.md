# ELECTRIC LAMP COMPRISING A TRANSVERSE ARC TUBE MOUNTING

## Abstract
Transverse mounting of an arc tube 14 with a pivoting attachment to a support rod 21 extending through a lamp jacket is effected by a hinge plate 25 comprising a metal ribbon folded back on itself and encircling a hinge pin 26 . The hinge plate 25 is welded to the support rod 21 , and the hinge pin 26 together with a wrap around metal band 27 clamps the pinched upper end of the arc tube 14 . A two piece connector 31, 32 having a bendable joint 33 serves in lieu of a latch and assures accurate orientation of the arc tube 14 after it has been transversely erected within the jacket.
