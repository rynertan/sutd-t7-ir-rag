OPERATION The instruction information delivery system 10 operations are primarily controlled hy the host processor 32 Fig. 2 using memory mapped, CRU and or interrupt driver input output.The system memory map is set forth in Table 1. Thus, for example, when a mass memory module containing maintenance software for a particular piece of equipment is plugged in and power turned on, the maintenance person presses the menu key and options are displayed as follows mark position, return, speak all the time, speak as required speak cautions only, and enroll speech. The operator moves the cursor to the desired option, for example, enroll speech by pressing the last key or next key, for moving the cursor, respectively up and down to the enroll speech position and pushing the select key. The system then displays the 8 command words and prompts the user to say each word aloud into the microphone. Thereafter the operator uses the microphone to speak the key labels into the speech processor.Thereafter the system responds to the operation s vocal commands or manual input on the keypad as follows, last or next to position the cursor on a item menu, and select to display the item. The operator repeats these steps to display an instruction level commensurate to his skill and commands the unit to speak. The unit then speaks the maintenance steps one at a time passing on to the next step on the command next . The operator responds to any questions posed by the unit with a Yes or No answer and the unit proceeds in light of the answer. With these commands and options the operator receives complete instructions to troubleshoot a problem and fix it. The instructions being given at a level commensurate with the operator s skill. HOST PROCESSOR The host processor 32 Fig. 4 includes a reset load 80 connected to the junction of leads 82 and 84. Lead 82 connects the reset load 80 to a data processor 96 whilst, lead 84 is connected to the junctions of leads 86 and 88. Lead 86 is connected to the junction of leads 90, 92, 94, 98, 100, 102, 104 and 106 which are connected respectively to the output terminal of buffer control 108, input terminals of direction control 110, parity check 112, control terminals of address decoder 114 and input terminals of mapper 116, interrupt controller 118, interval timer 120 and CRU decoder 122. Whilst lead 88 is connected to CRU decoder 124 and CRU OUT CRU clock output terminals 126. To reduce substantially the number of leads on the drawing and because the clock 128 and data processor s CRU out terminal are connected to the same elements the clock 128 is shown connected to transceiver 130 interconnecting an off board buffer 132 and transceiver 134. Transceiver 134 interconnects the data processor s CRU out terminal to the buffer control 108 whose output is connected by lead 90 to the reset leads to the previously described elements 110, 112, 114, 116, 118, 120, 122 and 124 and CRU out clk output terminal 126. The interrupt controller 118 has an output terminal connected by lead 142 to the data processor 96. The data processor 96 has output terminals A00 A03 connected by bus 144 to the mapper 116 and output terminals A04 A15 connected to the junction of buses 146 and 148. Bus 146 is connected to address buffer 150 while bus 148 is connected to the junction of busses 152 and 154. Bus 152 is connected to the off board buffer 132 and bus 154 is connected to bus 156. Bus 156 is connected to output terminals AM00 AMll of mapper 116 and to the junction of busses 158 and 160. Bus 158 is connected to the junction of busses 162 and 164 connected, respectively, to memory 166 and to the output terminals of address buffer 150 and input terminals of address decoder 114. Whilst, bus 160 is connected to the CRU decoder 122 and to bus 168 connected toRS 232 port 170.Finally the data processor 96 has terminalsD00 D15 connected by transceiver bus 172 to input terminals of data buffer 174 and bus 176 to the off board buffer 138. The data buffer 174 has its output terminals connected by bus 178 to busses 180 and 182. Bus 180 is connected to the parity circuit 112, whilst, bus 182 is connected to transceiver bus 188 interconnecting memory 166 and bus 186. Bus 186 interconnects the RS 232 Port 170 to the mapper 116. The interrupt controller 118 acting in response to interrupt signals on lead 202 synchronizes up to fifteen prioritized interrupts which are individually maskable. Level 0 interrupt will be generated at power up by on board circuitry at the reset pin of the data processor 96. Detailed interrupt assignments are specified in the processor memory map of Table 1. Other interrupts are outputted by the interval timer 120 at equally spaced intervals when the interval timer is activated and by the parity circuit 112 for the memory 166 when a parity error is detected. The mapper 116 is, for example, a 74LS610 memory mapper sold by Texas Instruments Incorporated. The mapper expands the 0 15 bit address to a 0 23 bit address. The mapper contains sixteen twelve bit registers selected by the top four processor 96 address lines during normal memory fetches. The memory registers are addressed into memory 166. The top four lines of the expanded address bus are decoded by address decoder 114 to generate eight active low bank selects. The CRU decoders 122 and 124 decode the data processor s control register unit control signals for flags and devices of the host processor. All CRU controls are presented at the output connector bus 212 of the CRU decoder 124 for off board flags. See Table 1 for a detailed CRU memory map The off board buffer 132 buffers the mass memory module 28 Fig. 3 AB00 AB23 address and DB00 DB15 line s 192 and 194, respectively, for increased circuit protection and drive capacity.

shift register buffer 200 Fig. 5 connected by the interrupt lead 202 Fig.s 4 5 and data bus lead 182, respectively, to the interrupt controller 118 Fig. 4 and data buffer 174. An address decoder 204 Fig. 5 is connected by lead 146, 148, 152 and 154 Fig. 4 shown collectively as lead 205 onFigure 5 to receive the expanded 24 bit address of the mapper 116 Fig. 4 . The address decoder 204 Fig. 5 is connected by leads 206 and 208, respectively, to the interrupt status shift register buffer 200 and to differential line drivers 210. The differential line drivers 210 are connected by lead 126 to theCRU out dock output of the data processor 96 Fig. 4 . The output terminals of the differential line drivers 210 are connected by leads 214 and 216 of cable 42 Fig. 1 to differential line receivers 218 Fig. 8 of the man machine interface MMI controller 50 Fig. 3 .The MMI controller 50 has differential line drivers 220 connected by leads 222 and 224 of cable 42 to differential line receivers 226 Fig. 4 .The differential line receivers 226 are connected by lead 228 to the interrupt status shift register buffer 200. The interface controller 34 Fig. 2 provides the decoding, buffering and drive circuitry necessary for the host processor 32 to communicate with the man machine interface MMI 38 Fig. 3 . Output to the MMI 38 is through the CRU out clk lines 126. While the status of the MMI is communicated to the host processor through the interrupt lead KEYINT 202 and the memory mapped register hereinafter described . A key interrupt signal is generated each time the user operates any key of the keypad or plugs in the headset. The content of theMMI memory mapped register is updated at each transmission. Operation of the interface controller link involves the execution of three multibit CRU instructions LDCRI . One transmission sequence, for example, is as follows Control 7 bit code defined a follows Bit 1 O Start Identification Bit 2 O Start Identification Bit 3 1 Start Identification Bit 4 O Status Type Keys Bit 4 1 Status Type Display Bits 5,6,7 Display Controller Codes X Address 9 bit X address coordinate on the display Y Address 9 bit Y address coordinate on the display During the transmission of the above sequence, the MMI status register 200 is updated with the data of the type specified by the previous control bit 4. The register is a one byte memory mapped register.The bit definitions are as follows Keys Bit 9 Display clear to send Bit 10 Headset status Bits 11 14 Keypad status Bit 15 Test Display Bit 9 Display clear to send Bit 10 Headset status Bits 11 14 Display status Bit 15 Test SPEECH PROCESSOR The speech processor 36 Fig. 2 comprises a speech recognition section and a speech synthesis section. The speech recognition section includes as part of the man machine interface MMI controller 50 Fig. 3 a microphone preamplifier 230 Fig. 6 connected by lead 232 to a microphone jack and by lead 234 to a gain amplifier 236. The gain amplifier 236 is connected by lead 238 to an analog to digitalA D coder decoder 240. The coder decoder 240 is connected by speech processor data transceiver bus 242 to bus interface circuitry 244 and to the junctions of busses 246 and 248. Bus 246 is connected by busses 250, 252, 254 and 256, respectively, to a template memory 258, firmware programmable read only memory PROMS 260, bit PROMS 262 and address register 264. Whilst, bus 248 is connected to the signal processor 266 such as the TMS 320 speech processor sold byTexas Instruments Incorporated. The bus interface circuitry is connected by leads 164 and 178 to the address and data buffers 154 and 174 Fig. 4 . The bus interface circuitry 244 Fig. 6 divides the addresses and data and inputs the addresses by lead 270 to an address multiplexer 272 inputs the data through lead 248 to signal processor 266. The circuitry 244 also inputs the addresses and data to transceiver bus 274 to the speech synthesis chip 276.The address multiplexer 272 also has an input terminal by lead 278 to address register 264 and an output terminal connected by lead 280 to the template memory 258. The speech synthesis section includes the speech synthesis chip 276 having an output terminal connected to an anti aliasing filter 282. The anti aliasing filter 282 is connected to an analog switch 284. The analog switch is connected by lead 286 to an audio amplifier 288. The audio amplifier is connected to an output controller 290 and by leads 292 and 294, respectively, to the headset jack and speaker 46 Fig. 3 . Speech recognition is performed entirely by the speech processor 36 Fig. 2 using speaker dependent recognition templates. The creation of speaker dependent reference patterns template enrollment is directed by the host processor. The host processor monitors and controls the speech processor through status and control registers and an interrupt. The speech processor supports interrupt and polled interfaces recognition of a command activates an interrupt similar to a keypad interrupt. The microphone, which may be, for example, integrated with a headset inputs on lead 232 Fig. 6 analog audio signals to the preamplifier 230 and gain amplifier 236 which amplifies the analog signals to a working level for the A D CODEC 240. TheCODEC is, for example, an eight bit CODEC having an 8KHz conversion rate. The CODEC provides a dynamic range comparable to thirteen linear bits in an eight bit word. The signal processor 266 is, for example, a single TMS 320 signal processor sold by Texas Instruments Incorporated which when requested by the host processor performs the speech pattern analysis required to compare the incoming speech with the templates stored in template memory 258. The template memory is, for example, eight 4K x 4 CMOS static RAMS. The bus interface circuitry 244 provides communications with the host processor and the dual ported template memory accessible to the host and speech processors. The dual ported template memory 258 allows data and information transfers between the speech processors. The speech processor 266 is controlled by the host processor through both interrupt and polled application. The speech synthesis section of the speech processor generates verbal output of the text presented on the MMI when invoked. Speech recognition overrides speech synthesis when both are active. The host processor uses text to speech rules stored in eight CMOS EPROMS to convert ASCII text to allophone strings. The linear predictive coding LPC 10 technique is used. The synthesis processor which is, for example, a TMS 5220A voice synthesizer processor has its audio output filtered in filter 282 amplified in amplifier 288 and sent to either a headset or a speaker. The audio output device is selected via an external switch located on the MMI. The code from the host processor is loaded into a first in first out FIFO buffer on the TMS 5220A speech synthesizer pursuant to an interrupt through the READY output. MASS MEMORY MODULE The mass memory module 28 Fig. 2 consists of a memory 300 Fig. 7 and its interface through bus 58 to the host processor 32, interface control 34 and speech processor 36. The memory 300 has two identical boards expandable to four boards . Each board has one quarter mega byte of memory. A board select switch 302 is used by the host processor for board selection. As the boards are identical only one is described. The memory 300 Fig. 7 includes four memory blocks 304, 306, 308 and 310. A control buffer 312 has read write terminals 0 3 and output enable terminals OE0 3 connected, respectively, to the read write terminals and output enable terminals of memory blocks 304, 306, 308 and 310. A data buffer 318 is connected by bus 320 to the DOO D15 pins of memory blocks 304, 306, 308 and 310. An address buffer 322 has its AX00 AX12 terminals connected by bus 324 to memory blocks 304 and 306 and its AYOO AY12 terminals connected by bus 326 to memory blocks 308 and 310. Finally an address decoder 328 has its block select BS0 BS3 and chip select CS0 CS7 terminals connected by busses 330 and 332, respectively, to the memory blocks 304, 306, 308 and 310. The address decoder 328 has its enable terminal connected to the board select switch 302 and the controll buffer 312 is connected to a write protect switch 334 for controlling, respectively, board selection for address and controlling the write function, i.e., the memory can be read but not altered.Finally a power switch 336 is connected to a battery 338 and a separate power line for power selection. The battery provides a backup source of power to maintain the contents of the memory 300. MAN MACHINE INTERFACE CONTROLLER The man machine interface controller 50 Fig. 3 performs three primary functions, namely, it receives through cable 42 and decodes data from the interface controller 34 Fig. 2 it codes and transmits keyboard status and it amplifies the speech input output. The man machine interface controller 50 Fig. 8 has its differential line receivers 218 connected by leads 214 and 216 and its differential line drivers 220 connected by leads 222 and 224, respectively to the host processor s interface controller s differential line drivers 210 Fig. 5 and differential line receivers 226. The differential line receivers 218 Fig. 8 are connected by lead 350 to the junction of a timing logic circuit 352 and shift register 354.Shift register 354 has its output terminals connected by bus 70 to the display controller 52 Fig. 3 while the timing logic 352 Fig. 8 has outputs connected by leads 356 and 358, respectively, to shift register 360 and multiplexer 362.Multiplexer 362 has its input terminals connected, respectively, by leads 72 and 78 Fig. 3 to the display 44 and keypad 48 for status determinations, and its output connected by lead 364 to shift register 360. The man machine interface controller as previously stated in the description of Fig. 6 has the audio preamplifier 230 connected by lead 232 to the microphone and by lead 234 to the gain amplifier 236 Fig. 6 . Also the speech control which includes the output control 290 and audio amplifier 288 is connected by lead 286 to receive the speech and output it, selectively, through leads 292 and 294 to headset and speaker. The serial interface with the host processor 32 contains the timing logic circuitry 352 for clocking in the display data and clocking out the man machine interface status. A serial to parallel converter 354 assembles the data and drives a 24 bit parallel interface with the display controller 52 Fig. 3 . A data available line indicates when the 24 bit bus is valid. A 512 x 352 line display configuration dictates transmission of nine bits of column and nine bits of row address information per transmission. A seven bit control word from the host processor determines the type of display and status. The keypad status is stored, buffered and transmitted to the host processor through an encoder which is, for example, a singleMOS keyboard encoder. DISPLAY UNIT The display 44 Fig. 3 is, for example, an electoluminescent flat panel display on a driver board. The display is for example a 512 row by 352 column X Y addressed matrix. Alternate columns and rows are brought to the opposite edges of the glass and gold plated. Connection to the glass is made with metalized Kapton flex circuitry integrated with a multilayer circuit board upon which the chip carrier packaged drivers are mounted. The display controller 52 includes a bit mapped memory 410 Fig. 9 and circuit to read its contents four bits at a time to the panel. The memory is accessible from the man machine interface 14 and host processor 32 for updating or clearing from a 24 bit parallel interface. The display controller develops the high voltage panel address and refresh signals required to activate the display panel. The display controller 52 includes a man machine interface clock 400 connected to the clock terminals of an RAS CAS RowAccess Column Access generator 402 and a counter 404. TheRAS CAS generator 402 is connected by leads 406 and 408 to the display buffer and DRAMS bit mapped memory 410. Counter 404 is connected by lead 412 to memory address bus 414 and by leads 416 and 418, respectively, to a counter 420 input and junction of leads 422 and 424. Leads 422 and 424 connect the counter 404, respectively, to a control bus 426 and counter 420.Counter 420 is also connected by lead 428 to the memory address bus 414. The control bus 426 has an output lead 430 and an input lead 432 connected to timing and control circuitry 434. The timing and control circuitry 434 is also connected by the memory address bus 414 and provides an output on lead 438 to level shift and opto coupling circuits. The control bus 426 also provides control signals to the control terminals of a memory selector PROM 440 and to a latch 442. The memory address bus 414 is also connected by leads 444 and 446, respectively, to the outputs of latch 448 and address translater 450. The address translator 450 is also connected to the output of a latch 452. The latches 442, 448 and 452 have input terminals connected by leads 454, 456 and 458 of bus 70 to the man machine interface controller 52 Fig. 3 . Bus 70 also includes a latch enable lead 460 and a clear to send lead 462 connected to the memory address bus 414. The latch 442 has output leads 464 and 466 connected, respectively, to the display buffer 410 and memory selectorPROM 440. The memory selector PROM is connected by lead 468 to the bit mapped memory 410. The output of the bit mapped memory 410 is connected by lead 470 to data to level shifters not shown and on to the display 82. The bit map memory 410 is used to store and activate the appropriate pixels on the screen. The memory 410 includes fourDRAMS to achieve a 12 MHz data rate for a 60 Hz display refresh rate. The opto coupling and level shift circuits are used to convert data and logic signals to CMOS levels for CMOS type drivers. The drivers may be, for example, Texas InstrumentsIncorporated SN 75551 and SN 75552 scan drivers on the display columns and SN 75553 and SN 75554 data drivers on the display rows. The data drivers are cascaded to provide four 128 bit shift registers for transfer of the pixel data from the bit map memory to the display, one column at a time. The scan drivers apply a sub threshhold voltage sequentially to each column which sums with ON data lines to light selected pixels. All columns are simultaneously refreshed at the end of each scan. Although a single embodiment of the invention has been described, it will be apparent to a person skilled in the art that various modifications to the details of construction shown and described can be made without departing from the scope of this invention.
