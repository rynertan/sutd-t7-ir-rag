# Facsimile transmitter unit.

## Abstract
A facsimile transmitter has a rotatable drum 10 and a sensor 18 for detecting dark light variations in a document mounted on the drum 10. Prior to transmission of modulated signals representing the dark light variations in the document on drum 10, synchronizing signals are transmitted from the transmitter to a facsimile receiver comprising a rotatable drum and a writing stylus for reproducing dark light variations on a copy medium mounted on the drum. The synchronizing signals comprise pulses of selected and controlled frequency duration and time lapse there between to signal to the receive the transmission model selected at the transmitter. The various modes which can be signalled include different and variable scanning rates, different frequency bandwidths and different forms of modulation.
