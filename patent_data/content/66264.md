# Fast breeder.

## Abstract
Herein disclosed is a fast breeder which is formed with a driver core region 2, 32, 35, 37, 50 having an enriched nuclear fuel substance and allowing liquid metal acting as a coolant to pass therethrough and with a branket region 3 5, 38, 51 surrounding the periphery of the driver core region 2, 32, 35, 37, 50 . A reactor stopping control rod 6B to be inserted downward into the driver core region 2, 32, 35, 37, 50 has an axially uniform density of boron 10. A reactor power adjusting control 6A to be inserted downward into the driver core region 2, 32, 35, 37, 50 has a lower density of boron 10 in a lower region than that in an upper region.
