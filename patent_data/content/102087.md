# Process for liquefying methane.

## Abstract
A process for liquefying natural gas in which heavier hydrocarbons are separated in a scrub column from the natural gas prior to liquefaction. The feed to the scrub column is intercooled against the methane rich overhead from said column and isentropically expanded before being introduced to the column and separated from the heavier hydrocarbons. The methane rich overhead stream is com pressed utilizing the mechanical energy of expansion and liquefied in a refrigerated heat exchanger.
