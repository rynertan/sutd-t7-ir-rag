# Method and apparatus for producing a liquid jet.

## Abstract
Oral hygiene methods and apparatus for producing a liquid jet by pumping liquid through an inlet 122 in a pump housing 23 from a reservoir 24 employ an arrangement in which the reservoir in an inverted position serves also as a cover for the pump housing or inlet. For optimum compactness, the inlet 122 is provided laterally at the pump housing, in particular, the inlet 122 may be located in a side wall 55 laterally of a part of the pump housing 22 serving as a first supporting base 38 in an upright position thereof, and the pump housing has a second supporting base 56 laterally of the first base 38 . In practice, the pump housing is laid on its side or second sup porting base 56 , whereby the inlet 122 comes to face upwardly. Liquid is then pumped from the reapplied reservoir 24 while the pump housing is lying on its side.
