## Description
This invention refers to a combustion system according to the introductory part of claim 1. The hydrogen oxygen generation according to this system is a demand system, in which the hydrogen oxygen is generated only upon the need. The generation is controlled in quantity by the need, such as an accelerator for an automotive device. From FR A 1 178 241 a process for operating a combustion system for mechanical drive systems using gaseous fuel is known, which comprises a hydrogen oxygen generator, a water reservoir for retaining water therein, a pair of similar electrode plates positioned in said water reservoir, a direct current voltage source connected to said plates to supply an electrical voltage low current thereto and to dissociate the hydrogen gas atoms and oxygen gas atoms from said water molecules, a gas mixing chamber, air intake means for combining air with the mixture of hydrogen and oxygen gases, a gas burner having a controlled amount of mixed gases from the mixing chamber fed thereto, means to ignite said gas air mixture in said burner, and demand controlled means for varying the release of said hydrogen oxygen gas atoms from said water molecules to thereby accelerate and decelerate the ignition of the gas air mixture in said burner. The hydrogen generator produces a uniform gas mixture hydrogen, oxygen and ambient air by an electrical polarization effect. The gas mixture is introduced to and intermixed with ambient air to produce an extra supply of gases beyond the capacity of the fuel cell. The combustible gas mixture enters into the combustion chamber and by spark ignition acts upon a mechanically displaceable piston. The supply of hydrogen gas determines the engine speed and is directly related to the applied voltage by way of the electrical polarization process. This system uses pure water, which is slightly acid, and metallic electrodes, one each within interconnected chambers one electrode generates oxygen and the other generates hydrogen from the water supply within a third chamber. Moreover, this system uses the combination of air and oxygen plus hydrogen mixed within the gas mixing chamber and delivered to the gas burner. FR A 2 096 416 discloses a gas fuel internal combustion engine, which includes a mixing chamber, within which air, hydrogen gas and exhaust gases are mixed and the mixture is fed into the combustion chamber, where it is ignited and where exhaust gases exit through a manifold and pass through a heat exchanger, which heats the hydrogen fuel stored in a tank. Liquid hydrogen within an insulated tank is gasified and hydrogen gas flows into a gas store and from there into a mixing chamber. Part of the exhaust gas from the combustion chamber is passed to the mixing chamber separate from the hydrogen gas and the oxygen gas. In addition, air is supplied into the mixing chamber. The gaseous fuel mixed with air is pumped under relatively high pressure into the engine combustion chamber to achieve a high compression ratio FR A 2 382 247 discloses a method and an apparatus for generating oxygen and hydrogen gas in an electrolytical manner the apparatus comprises at least one pair of electrodes, which partly are emerged into electrolytical water and conduct current, which is a pulsed dc current. The electrical source is a constant current source, and an electrical commutator is provided for operating the switching on and off of the current and thus generates the electrolysis current, which pulsates with the period of the pulses and at controlled intervals. With this method and apparatus exclusively oxygen and hydrogen gases are produced, and a combined gas is made available at the output end of a pipe, a nozzle or the like. It is an object of this invention to provide a combustion system combined from a source of any type of natural water, hydrogen generator for developping the hydrogen oxygen gases, and exhaust gases incorporated in a mechanical drive system. Such combustion system of the present invention is characterised in that The invention now will be described by way of examples with reference to the accompanying drawings Figure 1 shows the hydrogen source 10 which is a hydrogen oxygen generator. The water reservoir 2 is filled with natural water. Immersed in the water is an array of plates 3 of similar non oxidizing material. Applied to plates 3 is a source 27 of pulsed direct current potential via electrical inlet 27. The action of the pulsed direct current, a voltage current potential, on the plates causes the hydrogen atoms and oxygen atoms to become dissociated from the water molecule. Because the action is not a chemical action any natural water irrespective of source may be utilized. Varying either the potential of the direct current voltage source or the pulse rate of the pulsing of the direct current potential will vary proportionally the generation of the hydrogen oxygen. Other factors are disclosed for varying the output of the generator. To replenish the expended water the generator provides a continuous water source 1. A safety valve 28 is rupturable upon excessive gas build up. Switch 29 is a gas pressure switch to maintain a predetermined gas pressure level about a regulated low volume. The generated hydrogen gas 4 is fed via pipe 5 to a gas mixing chamber 7, wherein the hydrogen gas is intermixed with exhaust gases 22 from a source hereinafter described. The mixture of hydrogen gas 4 and exhaust gases 22 is fed via pipe line 9 to a carburettor air mixture system. The gas mixture 8 is fed through a nozzle to a chamber in a jet spray. The jet spray of gases combines with the intake air to form a gas mixture of hydrogen gas, which together with oxygen is entered into a combustion chamber. The exhaust gases 64, the residue of the combustion, now comprise an exhaust mixture 64. These exhaust gases 64 are fed via pipe line 24 to the gas mixing chamber 40. The pipeline 24 passes through cooling chamber 50 for cooling the gases therein. The cooling chamber 50 also functions as a spark arrestor to eliminate the possibility of gas ignition inside the mixing chamber 40. The excess exhaust gases are expelled into the atomsphere. The gases generated from the water in generator 10 also include the oxygen component of the water in addition to nitrogen. The outlet 5 on the generator 10 receives the oxygen and nitrogen gases generated thereby and feeds the same to the mixing chamber 40. The flow of the hydrogen gas is, of course, critical therefore, there is incorporated in line 5 a gas flow valve to adjust the hydrogen flow. With particular reference to Figure 2 there is illustrated the combustion chamber 60. The gas mixture 8, which is generated and mixed in the arrangement of Figure 1, is directed by pipe line 9 and nozzle 11 to the cone 65. The gas mixture combines with air 14 as it enters cone area 65. The combined gas mixture, atomized by the jet nozzle 11 with air intake 14 is directed by the cone 65 to the dispersing chamber 66. There, the gas mixture 15 is further mixed with air 14 to form combustible gas 15. The gas air mixture is dispersed via ports 67a xxx 67n from the dispersing chamber 66 into the firing area of the combustion chamber 60. The gas mixture 8 is also fed by pipeline 9 to a separation chamber 71. This chamber sections off a controlled amount of the intake gas mixture to the pilot light line 58. The pilot light firing gas 57 is also sequenced by the separation chamber 71 such as through an associated mechanical drive, much in the same manner as the cylinder of an automobile engine. The mixed gas 56a, 56n ejected from ports 67a xxx 67n of the dispensing chamber 66 is ignited by the pilot combustion 57 and thereby causes combustion of the mainstream gases. As the exhaust gases 64 rise upwardly in the cylinder 61 of the combustion chamber 60 the cone 63 captures a portion of the exhaust gases 64. The captured exhaust gas is returned via pipe line 68 and outlet 74 to the combustion process as set in Figure 1 or expelled for other purposes. The major portion of the exhaust gases 64 by pass the cone 63 and rise further to the outlet exhaust 69 and are expelled at opening 73. As low voltage direct current is applied to safety valve 28, a solenoid is activated, which applies a control voltage to the hydrogen generator plates 3 via terminal 27 through pressure switch 29. As the electrical power activates the electric solenoid, hydrogen gas is caused to pass through a flow adjustment valve and then outlet pipe 5 for utilization. A gas regulator valve is utilized to reduce the pressure level inside the hydrogen generator 10. Once hydrogen generator 10 reaches an optimum gas pressure level, pressure switch 29 shuts off electrical power to the hydrogen exciters. If the chamber pressure exceeds a predetermined level, the safety release valve 28 is activated disconnecting the electrical current and thereby shutting down the entire system for safety inspection.
