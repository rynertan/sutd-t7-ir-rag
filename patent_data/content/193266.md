# Gravity flow cassette.

## Abstract
A gravity flow cassette 10 for use with an I.V. infusion pump 100 has a fluid inlet 16 , a fluid outlet 18 and a pump chamber 22 with associated pump piston 24 . A valve body 46 having an annular groove 48 and a partial groove 50 parallel thereto is slidably disposed in the cassette 10 for reciprocal movement between a first position and a sec ond position. Engagement of the cassette 10 with the pump 100 firmly holds the valve body 46 in the first position wherein the annular groove 48 is sealed and the valve body 46 can be rotated to alternately provide fluid communica tion through the partial groove 50 between the inlet 16 and the pump chamber 22 or between the pump chamber 22 and the outlet 18 . Upon disengagement of the cassette 10 from the pump 100 , the valve body 46 can be moved into the second position to seal the partial groove 50 and provide for simultaneous fluid communication through the annular groove 48 between the input 16 , the output 18 and the pump chamber 22 .
