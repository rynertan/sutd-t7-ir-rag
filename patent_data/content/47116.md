## Description
EICI E AND METHOD FOR CONDITIONING BLE The present invention relates to an article and a method for conditioning the hair, and a process for the manufacture of the article The frequent shampooing which is necessary to rid the hair of dirt and sebum tends to leave it tangled, harsh, lack lustre, full of static electricity and generally unmanageable, and it is well known to apply creme rinses or conditioners to the hair after shampooing to improve manageability and, in particular, wet combability.Such materials generally leave a film of resinous or waxy material on each hair shaft, thus increasing both lustre and manageability. Conditioners and creme rinses may contain inter alia cationic material which is substantive to the hair and which reduces the static charge on the hair examples of such materials are given in USPatent Specification No. 3 472 840 Union Carbide . Conditioners and creme rinses are generally in liquid form and are applied the hair subsequent to shampooing, rinsing, and towelling to a partially dry state. he conditioner must then be rinsed off and the hair generally allowed to dry without further towelling. This operation is cumbersome and time consuming in itself and also increases the drying time of the hair, so that there is a tendency for the user, if pressed for time, sometimes to omit the conditioning stage altogether. It is also difficult using a liquid conditioner to treat only a part of the hair, as may be desired for example in the case of long hair which is greasy near the roots but brittle and fly away at the ends In US Patent Specification No. 4 149 551 and BritishPublished Applications Nos.2 022 415 and 2 024 623 there has been proposed a towel type hair conditionnng article in the form of a flexible substrate, such as non woven rayon, carrying a releasable coating of a solid, waterinsoluble conditioning agent such as ditallow dimethyl ammonium chloride. When the article is rubbed on damp or wet hair, the coating of solid conditioning agent is transferred to the hair. This can either be rinsed off or left on as desired.As with conventional liquid conditioners, conditioning is preferably carried out after shampooing, rinsing and partial drying. With this type of article, difficulties have been experienced in achieving efficient transfer of the conditioner from the towel to the hair, and efficient distribution of the solid conditioning material over the hair. Furthermore, user surveys have shown the existence of a credibility gap in that some consumers are not altogether conviced that any active ingredient is actually present on the towel the loading of conditioner on the towel has to be relatively low in order to prevent overloading of the hair, and these consumers feel that there is insufficient visual and or tactile evidence of the presence of conditioning material on the towels. The present invention provides an article for conditioning hair, which comprises a flexible waterinsoluble and non water dispersible substrate impregnated with an aqueous solution or dispersion of one or more hair conditioning agents, the weight ratio of water associated with the substrate to substrate being at least 1.5 to 1 and the amount of hair conditioning agent present being from 2 to 15 grams per square metre of substrate. The invention also provides a method for the manufacture of an article according to the previous paragraph, which comprises so impregnating a flexible water insoluble. and non water dispersible substrate with an aqueous solution or dispersion of. one or more hair conditioning agents, that in the impregnated article thus obtained the weight ratio of water associated with the substrate to the substrate is at least 1.5 to 1 and the total amount of hair conditioning agent present is from 2 to 15 grams per square metre of substrate. A further aspect of the invention is a method for conditioning hair, which comprises rubbing the hair with an article as previously defined, whereby an effective amount of hair conditioning agent is transferred from the article to the hair. The hair may be wet, damp or dry Optionally the conditioner may subsequently be rinsed off but this is by no means essential. It will be noted that the article of the invention is wet, that is to say, it has associated with it a substantial amount of water in which the active hair conditioning ingredient s is or are dissolved or dispersed, according to solubility. If necessary, depending on the active ingredients chosen, a minor amount of a cosmetically acceptable alcohol, preferably ethanol, may be included to assist in the dissolution or dispersion of the active ingredients. The wet article of the present invention possesses various advantages over an article having a solid coating.Efficient transfer of the conditioning agent from the article to the hair is assured, and the dissolved or dispersed form of the active ingredient allows it to be distributed as evenly as possible over the hair. Burthermore, the article is as suitable for application to dry or nearly dry hair as it is for the treatment cf damp or wet hair. If an article carrying a solid coating of conditioner is applied to dry hair, uneven distribution of the conditioner will result, with overloading in some areas, leading to lankness and greasimess, and no conditioning at all in other areas. The article of the present invention, however, has sufficient wetness built in for effective treatment of dry hear without separate wetting being required.The article may accordingly be applied not merely immediately after shampooing but whenever desired, for example when atmospheric conditions cause a build up of static charge on the hair, and it may also be used to treat just a part of the hair, as in the previously mentioned case of long hair greasy near the roots and brittle and fly away at the ends.The article of the invention can in this case be applied just to the ends of the hair without wetting and without any need to rinse the conditioner off this is a very quick and simple process. Consumer tests have also shown a user preference for the wet article of the invention consumers are apparently more prepared to believe that an active ingredient is present when the article is wet. The smooth feel of the liquid on the article is readily associated in the consumer s mind with the feel of conditioner on the hair, and after use the exhausted article becomes auite different in appearance and feel. This cueing is preferably assisted by including small amounts of colouring matter and perfume in the impregnating liquid so that during use the article will lose colouring and perfume. The article of the invention is tased on a flexible substrate. This must of course be sufficiently absorbent to retain an adequate quantity of impregnating liquid, and is preferably of open or porous structure. The substrate must also have sufficIent wet strength to retain its integrity during both storage and use. Suitable materials include woven and non woven fabrics, high wet strength absorbent papers and other fibrous materials both na4.aral and synthetic, sponges, and foamed plastic materials. The substrate may for example take the form of a sheet, but other shapes, for example , pads, or mittens to fit over the hand, are also possible provided that they allow convenient application of the conditioner to the hair. Articles based on a sheetsubstrate, hereinafter preferred to as towels, have proved most convenient, and preferred materials for then sheet substrate on non woven fabrics, for example, VIIENE Trade Mark , a non woven rayon . The sheet is preferably approximately hand sized for convenience of manipulation a square sheet 13 cms x 13 cms has been found in consumer tests to be comfortable to use. A finger slit is advantageously provided to prevent the towel from slipping out of the user s hand. The loading of active ingredient on the towel is from 2 to 15 grams per square metre of substrate, calculated as concentrate.Below this level the amount of conditioner is simply too low to have a perceptible effect on the hair above the upper limit the hair will be grossly overloaded with conditioner and will be left limp and greasy,especially if the hair is not subsequently rinsed. The preferred level of active ingredient is from 2 to 12 grams per square metre, more preferably ss to 10 grams per square metre and desirably 6 to 9 grams per square metre. The non woven rayon fabric VILENE ref erred to above has a weight per unit are of approximately 92.9 grams per square metre. With this substrate, the loading range of from 2 to 15 grams per square metre is thus equivalent to a loading of from 2.15 to 16.15 by weight. A wide variety of active ingredients may be used in the article of the invention, both s ly aid and in admixture. Desirably at least one of the conditioning agents used is water soluble, or at least soluble in water contannnng a minor proportion of alcohol, in order to take maximum advantage of the presence of the asscoiated water and desirably at least one of the conditioning agents used is a cationic material, because such materials show outstanding benefits in conditioning hair. Of course these two characteristics may be either combined in a single ingredient, or achieved by means of a suitable mixture of ingredients. Advantageously the article of the invention includes a quaternary ammonium compounds, a water soluble one being especially preferred. Compounds of the formula. R1R2R3R4N x are preferred in which R1 is a C10 to C22 alkyl, R2, R3 andR4 are lower alkyl and may be the same or different, and X is a monovalent anion, especially a halide ion, or 1 m of an m valent anion. An example of such a material with excellent hair conditioning properties is cetyl trimethyl ammonium chloride, which is available commercially as a 50 aqueous solution under the trade name ARQUAD 16 50t . Other quaternary ammonium compounds containing one or more quaternary nitrogen atoms and quaternary imidazolinium compounds may also be used in the article of the invention. Advantageously the article may include a non ionic material. Fatty alcohols, especially lauryl, cetyl and stearyl alcohols, have beneficial. effects on hair, especially when used in conjunction with a cationic material. A mixture of cetyl and stearyl alcohols, sold commercially under the trade name of ltliU CS , has proved valuable in this respect. Alternative non ionic materials include silicones, sorbitan esters, polyhydric alcohol esters, tertiary phosphine oxides and tertiary amine oxides. Accordingly, in a first preferred embodiment of the invention, a water soluble cationic conditioning agent, preferably a quaternary ammonium compound, is used in conjunction with a fatty alcohol.. The two components are advantageously used in approximately equal quantities. The fatty alcohol is of course substantially water insoluble and is dispersed rather than dissolved. Anionic materials, for example, aIky1 sulphates, alkyl ether sulphates and alcohol sulphonates, may also be included in the article of the invention, either alone or in conjunction with other types of conditioner. Like the fatty alcohols, they are especially valuable when used together with a cationic material. In a second preferred embodiment of the invention, a water soluble cationic conditioning agent, preferably a quaternary ammonium compound is used in conjunction with an alkyl sulphate preferably C10 to C22 , the cationic component being used in excess. The weight ratio of cationic conditioner to anionic conditioner may, for example, be in the range of from 2 1 to 5 1. In this case both components are water soluble and will be in solution. Zwitterionic and ampholytic hair conditioning agents may also be used in the article of the invention. As indicated previously, the article of the invention may be manufactured by impregnating a suitable substrate with a suitable aqueous conditioner composition containing appropriate concentrations of the desired active ingredients and suitable quantities of other materials such as colouring and perfume. Where the article is a towel, the sheet substrate may conveniently be dipped into a bath of suitable aqueous liquid, and excess liquid then removed, for example, by means of squeeze rollers. To prevent the articles from drying out during storage, they need to be packed wet into water impermeable containers.Sachetsof plastic film and or metal foil are ideal for this purpose. Preferably each article is sealed into an individual package. If necessary, towel type articles can be folded or rolled for packing. The following Examples illustrate the invention. Example I A piece of ttVIIExEt non woven rayon fabric 92.9 grams per square metre , approximately 13 cms x 13 cms and weighing 1.57 grams, was provided with a slit about 3 cms long positioned centrally parallel to, and about 2 cms from, one edge, to serve as a finger slit. The piece of fabric was dipped in a bath containing an aqueous composition as follows Percentage by weight 50 aqueous solution of cetyl trimethyl ammonium chloride ARQUAD 16 50 Cetyl alcohol steavyl alcohol mixture LAUREX CS 2 75 Perfume 0.60 Formalin 38 active 0.26Hexacol orange dye 1 solution 0.75 Water to 100.0 The pH of the composition had been adjusted to 3.0. The wet towel was rolled gently to remove excess moisture, and packed wet in a polypropylene aluminium foil sachet. A number of towels were prepared in this way and the loading of the active conditioning ingredients cetyl trimethyl ammonium chloride, cetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol on the towels ranged from 0.12 to 0.15 g per towel, equivalent to 7 to 9 g m2 or 7.6 to 9.6 by weight of the substrate. It will be noted that the weight ratio of cationic conditioning agent to fatty alcohol was 1 1. In use, the towel was placed on the palm of the user s hand and the middle finger inserted through the slit4 The towel could then be comfortably and conveniently be robbed on the user s hair. It was found to impact conditioning benefits to both wet and dry hair. Best results were obtained on hair that had recently been shampooed with wet, just shampooed hair wet combability was greatly improved. Example 2 A number of towels were prepared by the procedure of Example 1, but using a bath containing a composition made up of. the following ingredients Percentage by weight nARQUAD 16 50X 5.50Lauryl alcohol 2.75Perfume 0.60Formalin 38 active 0r26 Rexacol orange dye 1 solution 0.75 Water to 100.0 the pH of the composition again being adjusted to 3.0. The amount of active ingredient cetyl trimethyl ammonium chloride and lauryl alcohol taken up varied from 6.5 to 7,6 g m2 Again, the weight ratio of cationic conditioning agent to fatty alcohol was 1 1. vowels prepared using this combination of active ingredients were found to give a good conditioning effect but were less effective than the towels of Example 1. Example 3 A liquid composition was prepared from the following ingredients, the pR being adjusted to 3.0 Percentage by weight ARQUAD 16 50 5 50 Sodium stearyl C18 sulphate 89 active 0.90Perfume 0.60 Formalin 38 active 0.26Hexacol orange dye 1 solution Water to 100.0Towels were prepared using this solution according to the procedure described in Example 1. The total weight of the active ingredients taken up ranged from 4.52 to 5.20 g m2. The ratio of cationic conditioner to anionic conditioner was 3.43 1 thus the cationic conditioner content of the towels ranged from 3.50 to 4.02 g m2, and the anionic conditioner content ranged from 1.02 to 1.17 g mê. These towels were found to have a conditioning effectiveness comparable to that of the towels of Example 2. Example 4 A liquid composition was prepared from the following ingredients, the pH being adjusted to 3.0 Percentage by weight tARQUAD 16 50 5.50 Sodium cetyl C16 sulphate 30 active 2.46Perfume 0.60Formalin 58 active 0.26Rexacol orange dye 1 solution 0.75Water to 100.0Towels were prepared using this solution according to the procedure described in Example 1. The ratio of cationic conditioner to anionic conditioner was 3.73 1. he total conditioner deposited on each towel ranged from 4.48 to 5031 g m2 consisting of 3.53 to 4.18 g m2 of cationic conditioner and 0.95 to 1.12 g mê of anionic conditioner. These towels showed outstanding conditioning performaace , comparable to that of the towels of Example 1.
