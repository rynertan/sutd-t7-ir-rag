# DIGITAL PHASE CORRELATOR

## Abstract
A digital phase correlator compares the relative phase of two or more high frequency clocks and corrects for any detected phase difference. The phase detector includes a pair of flip flops whose output is an indication of which of the two clock pulses is leading the other. The output of the flip flop controls, through a circuit including a rotating shift register and a multitap delay line, the delay introduced to one of the clocks in a manner such that the phase difference between the clocks is reduced to a minimum.
