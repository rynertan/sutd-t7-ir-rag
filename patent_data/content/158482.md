# Internal combustion circuit breaker.

## Abstract
An internal combustion electrical circuit breaker com prising an insulating cylinder 1 , a pair of electrical conduc tors 2,2 penetrating the cylinder approximately perpendi cular to its longitudinal axis, a conducting hollow piston 5 contacting the conductors, an insulating pipe 6 at its open portion, an arcing chamber 7 with arcing blades 9 a combustion chamber 8 which is separated from the arcing chamber by the piston and ignition 11 gas injection 12, 13 and valve means 10 communicating with the combustion chamber. When igniting a fuel oxygen mixture within the combus tion chamber, the piston is propelled into the arcing chamber while the gases within the hollow piston and the arcing chamber blow across the sparks developing between con ductors, piston and arcing blades The circuit breaker is reset by injecting compressed gas through the pipe.
