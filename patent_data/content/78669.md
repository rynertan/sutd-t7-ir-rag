# Inserts for squeeze bottles.

## Abstract
Plug inserts for squeeze bottles are provided with a dished diaphragm to ensure rapid train back of liquid which is expelled from the bottle but which is surplus to requirements. The orifice is designed to supply an angled jet of liquid and to give a visual indication to the user of the angle at which the jet will emerge.
