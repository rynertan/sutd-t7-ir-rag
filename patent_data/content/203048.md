# Sorption sheet for sorbing a plurality of discrete samples and method of producing such a sorption sheet.

## Abstract
In a sorption sheet 1 for sorbing a plurality of discrete samples that simultaneously emit photons or beta particles, the emission thereof to be individually monitored, barriers 2 of a photon and or beta particle attenuating material extend through at least a portion of the thickness of the sheet 1 which is known per se, to prevent cross talk between the samples when monitored. The barriers are produced by soak ing a liquid photon and or beta particle attenuating material in, a pattern of lines through at least a portion of the thickness of the sheet, whereupon that material is dried and or cured.
