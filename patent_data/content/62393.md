# APPARATUS FOR DISPOSAL OF TOXIC MATERIALS SUCH AS RADIOACTIVE WASTE

## Abstract
Method and means for solidifying nuclear waste for permanent disposal are disclosed. A storage con tainer, in the preferred form of a drum or barrel 28 , is charged with a predetermined amount of liquid poly mer resin 119 in an uncatalyzed state. Catalyst con taining frangible ampoules 131 are also positioned in the drum with a rotatable mixer mechanism 65 . At a waste filling station 26 , the mixer is rotated to break the ampoules so as to mix the catalyst and the resin. The catalyzed resin is then mixed with added waste material from a feed 33 to completely encapsulate the waste prior to solidification of the resin. Monitoring of the filling and mixing process is provided by con tinually sensing the torque force being applied to the rotating mixer mechanism. Where the waste is a dustlike, dry particulate material, dust control means and method are also provided.
