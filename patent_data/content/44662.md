# Tire building machine.

## Abstract
The tire building machine comprises a tire building drum 22 or shaper, annular bladders 82 adjacent each end and a bead setter and bladder pusher mechanism 198 movable axially of the drum selectively to set a tire bead in proper position and to push and effectively roll the bladder 82 when inflated to cause the ply edges of the tire to be wrapped about the bead without air entrapment and stitched securely. Such mechanism includes a bead setting and pushing ring mounted for axial movement and hydraulic actuators 158 are provided for effecting such movement. The ring has a flat face, a short axially extending radially inner annular surface or shelf 210 for restricting expansion of a portion of the bladder rearwardly of the face when inflated thereunder, and a rounded inner peripheral edge or bead 212 projecting beyond the shelf which grips the bladder when inflated to prevent relative sliding movement of the bladder and ring during bladder push. There is further provided a movable stop 166 for precisely locating bead set and bladder pick up positions of the ring and bead clamps for holding the tire bead to the ring during the bead set operation.
