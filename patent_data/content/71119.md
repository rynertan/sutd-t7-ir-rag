# NICKEL RETICULATE ELECTRODE FOR NICKEL OXIDE ELECTRODES

## Abstract
This disclosure is directed to the preparation of nickel plated organic polymer foam reticulate electrodes having open, interconnected cells and upon which nickel is depo sited first electrolessly then electrolytically. The nickel plated reticulate is subsequently impregnated with precursor salts yielding active nickel oxides and then compressed to obtain a compressed, nickel plated, reticulated polymeric foam reservoir containing active nickel oxides also referred to as nickel oxide hydroxide, viz., Ni OH â‚‚.
