# A lifting wedge.

## Abstract
A lifting wedge is intended in particular for lifting a paper roll in the vertical position, and which is made up of a substantially cylindrical lifting wedge part 1 having the cross sectional shape of the core hollow of the paper roll, a lifting belt 2 fitted to the lifting wedge, and friction surfacing 3 . The lifting wedge accompanies during transport the roll to be lifted. The lifting wedge part 1 is divided in its longitudinal direction preferably into three wedge shaped sections. The lifting belt 2 encircles that wedge section which has a larger cross sectional surface in its lower part, and forms a lifting loop above the wedge section. When the lifting belt is tightened, the wedge section encircled by it presses against the outer wedge sections, whereupon the friction surfacing 3 on the circumference of the lifting wedge presses against the inner wall of the core hollow and causes the lifting wedge to adhere reliably to the core hollow. The lifting wedge can be of wood and sawn into wedge sections, or it can be cast into wedge shaped sections. The friction surfacing is prefer ably in the form of a rubber belt, or it can be friction increasing material on the surface of the wedge sections. Band or rope can be used for the lifting belt.
