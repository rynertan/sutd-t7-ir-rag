## Description
FAT AND OIL REPLACEMENTS AS HUMAN FOOD INGREDIENTS This invention deals with fat and oil replacements in human foods. Scientists from many sectors are spending a great deal of their time trying to develop materials that can be introduced into the human food chain. These materials are being developed in response to numerous investigations and reports regarding human consumption, and the impact of such consumption, of natural fats and oils by the human population. These investigations and reports have documented and established that certain, widely consumed, fats and oils are detrimental to human health and should be removed from or severely reduced in human diets. The edible fats and oils in the food we eat are widely distributed in nature. They are derived from vegetable, animal and marine sources and are often by products in the production of vegetable proteins and the like. Fats and oils have been extracted and used for centuries as soaps, detergents, raw materials, antifoams, lubricants, food and fuels. The chemical structures of fats are very complex owing to the many combinations and permutations of fatty acids that can be esterified at the three hydroxyl groups of glycerol. These materials, generically known as triglycerides, are named according to the parent acids that are used to esterify the glycerol. For example,EMI1.1 is named tristearin. Many naturally occurring fats and oils are made up of fatty acids with chain lengths greater than twelve carbon atoms A vast majority of such fats and oils are made up of chain lengths of sixteen carbons or greater. Most of the variable chemical and physical properties result from the effects of the various fatty acids esterified with glycerol. Diets that are high in red meats lead to the ingestion of large quantities of saturated fats and generally, vegetable oils are a source of polyunsaturated fats and oils, such polyunsaturated fats and oils being modified by hydrogenation to provide commercial food products which are monounsaturated and saturated fats and oils.Investigators have strongly urged a direct link between high intake of monounsaturated fats and saturated fats and cardiovascular diseases and certain human cancers. One report has suggested an alarming change in the diets of the affluent portion of the world in which per capita dietary fat intake has increased to an all time high, mostly in the form of saturated fats from red meat and, the theater portion from the modified fats and oils known as the separated fats and oils such as margarine, vegetable oils, shortenings, salad oils, cooking oils, and the like. The ingestion of these fats and oils raises blood cholesterol levels which leads to some of the cardiovascular diseases alluded to supra. In addition to the problems discussed above, there is the very serious health problem of obesity itself. Part of the program to relieve or avoid obesity is to provide dietary foods which are low in calories and since the fats and oils described above provide a major, and largely discretionary source of calories, it would be beneficial if the fats and oils could be replaced with low calorie or no calorie substitutes. This obesity problem extrapolates directly to persons who aren t really clinically technically obese but who are overweight and also to those who aren t overweight but desire to attain and maintain the slim look .To these people, low calorie or no calorie fats and oils would also be desirable. Attaining a low calorie or no calorie food is not an easy task. Currently, there is not a low calorie fat and oil commercially available. Typically, low calorie or diet foods are obtained by reducing the sugar content or essentially eliminating the sugar and using artificial sweeteners such as saccharin, aspartame, cyclamates, L sugars and the like. Substitute fats and oils have been described byHamm, D.J., Journal of Food Science, vol. 49 1984 page 419, as trialkoxytricarballylate, trialkoxycitrate, trialkoxyglycerylether, Jojoba oil and sucrose polyester, the latter material currently being the oil of choice. Sucrose polyester has been described by Jandacek, Ronald J., et al.,American Journal of Clinical Nutrition 33, February 1980 page 251, as a mixture of hexa , hepta , and octaesters of sucrose, which is prepared by esterifying sucrose with long chain fatty acids. Desirable features in would be substitute oils and fats are a resistance to digestion to achieve the low calorie .or no calorie effect b the anticholesterol effects c chemical and biological inertness d thermal stability, especially high thermal stability for cooking uses e other functional and physical properties comparable to or superior to natural fats and oils, especially in terms of end use such as, for example, lending texture to cakes, enhancing flavors, enhancing taste, or at least not contributing to undesirable taste, consistency, and so forth.The substitute fats and oils should not have a strong laxative effect such as is known in some of the natural fats and oils should not degrade under high heat, such as thermal oxidation during deep frying should not degrade under biological conditions in the body, for example, should not degrade to long chain alcohols or some other cytotoxic chemicals and, the substitute fats and oils should be fairly inexpensive because not only should the food item prepared with the substitute fat or oil have organoleptic acceptability but it must be affordable. The compositions of this invention provide a means for resolving the aforementioned problems, in that, the incorporation of certain silicones as substitutes for fat and oils, the use of certain silicones as edible food products, and the use of certain silicones in the preparation of foods, where the intent is to ingest the silicones as a significant portion of the diet, resolves many of the aforementioned problems without detracting from the bulk of the diet. This can be accomplished while maintaining, and in some cases, enhancing the organoleptic properties of the food without the commensurate potential calorie problems associated with natural fats and oils or some of the newer, synthetic, organic candidate fat and oil substitutes. Numerous studies in various animal species rats, mice, rabbits, dogs and monkeys have established the safety and essentially innocuous nature of polydimethylsiloxanes and related silicones. Studies with C 14 labeled materials have shown that adequately devolatilized silicone polymers are not absorbed from the gastro intestinal tract, and that such materials are eliminated in the fecal contents. Consequently, polydimethylsiloxanes have been widely used for applications involving food processing and food contact. These applications, which have included release coatings, defoaming, anti oxidant, etc., have resulted in foods containing at most parts per million levels of silicone. Furthermore, recent rat feeding studies by Bracco,Baba, and Hashim have shown that significant loss of weight can be obtained by replacing part of the dietary lipids with a commercial phenylmethylsiloxane. They observed good acceptance when fed ad libitum, apparent satiety as evidenced by the absence of significant compensation by over eating, and no evidence of adverse physiological effects such as excessive anal leakage diarrhea or damage to intestinal mucosae even when the diet contained up to 22 weight percent of the phenylmethylsiloxane. A book written by Weiss, T. J., Food Oils and TheirUses, AVI Publishing Co., Inc., Westport, Conn., 1983, on page 112, reviews articles suggesting various ppm uses for silicones in association with food. Under the section entitled tAntifoam Agents , Weiss disclosed that Babyan had shown that the presence of small amounts i.e. ppm quantities, of silicone oil in deep frying oil increased the smoke point of the oil by about 140C 250F and that silicones in 0.5 to 3 ppm quantities when added to frying fats inhibit foam formation. It was further suggested in the reviewed articles that larger quantities of such silicone oils 50 100 ppm may even cause foaming of the frying fat where it is not ordinarily expected.The suggestion is also presented there that the silicone antifoams may be deleterious in cakes, in frying doughnuts and in manufacturing potato chips, all in an antifoaming, i.e. ppm, context. Certain other non silicone low calorie fat substitutes have been disclosed in the prior art in U.S.Patent No. 3,600,186, issued August 17, 1971 to Mattson, et al. U.S. Patent No. 3,954,976, issued May 4, 1976 toMattson, et al. U.S. Patent No. 4,005,196, issued January 25, 1977 to Jandacek, et al. U.S. Patent 4,034,083, issued July 5, 1977 to Mattson and, U.S. PatentNo. 4,461,782, issued July 24, 1984 to Robbins, et al. None of these references, either singly or in combination, show or even suggest the compositions of this invention. It is accordingly one object of this invention to provide food compositions for human consumption which contain certain silicones. A further object of this invention is the use of certain silicones in the preparation of edible food products or as components ingredients in edible food products. Yet another object of this invention is the use of certain silicones in the preparation of foods. Other objects and advantages will become apparent through a reading of the entire specification and claims. Thus, there is provided by the instant invention a food composition for human consumption containing 0.1 to 100 weight percent, based on the total food composition, of polyorganosiloxanes, said polyorganosiloxanes having organic carbon contents of at least fifteen weight percent, wherein the carbon is linked to silicon by silicon carbon bonds said polyorganosiloxanes having average molecular weights of at least 500 grams mole and having the general formula R3SiO1 2a R2SiO2 2 b RSiO3 2 c SiO4 2d RfSi O3 f A 3 q SiRg e 2 2 wherein R is individually selected from the group consisting of i C6H5 ii CH2 CH ,EMI6.1 iv a phenylethyl v ss phenylethyl vi alkyl groups of 1 to 20 carbon atoms vii hydrogen viii hydroxyl ix R CH3 2SiO x R OOC CH2 h, wherein R is individually selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, an alkyl radical of 1 to 20 carbon atoms andC6H5 , wherein h is an integer of from 2 to 10 EMI7.1 wherein n and m each have an average value of from 0 to 25 and E is an integer of from 2 to 6 A is a hydrolytically stable divalent hydrocarbon radical which links to silicon atoms by silicon carbon bonds a, b, c, d, e, f and g have mole fraction values respectively ranging from 0 1, 0 1, 0 1, 0 0.75, 0 1, 0 3 and 0 3. Also provided is a method of preparing food using certain silicones wherein there is used, in such preparation, polyorganosiloxanes having organic carbon contents of at least fifteen weight percent, wherein the carbon is linked to silicon by silicon carbon bonds said polyorganosiloxanes having molecular weights of at least 500 g mole and having the general formula R3SiO1 2 a R2SiO2 2 b RSiO3 2 c SiO4 2 d RfSi O3 f A O3 q SiRg e 2 2 wherein R is individually selected from the group consisting of i C6H5 ii CH2 CH EMI7.2 iv a phenylethyl v ss phenylethyl vi alkyl groups of 1 to 20 carbon atoms vii hydrogen viii hydroxyl ix R CH3 2SiO x R OOC CH2 h, wherein R is individually selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, an alkyl radical of 1 to 20 carbon atoms andC6H5 , wherein h is an integer of from 2 to 10z EMI8.1 wherein n and m each have an average value of from 0 to 25 and p is an integer of from 2 to 6 a, b, c, d, e, f and g have mole fraction values respectively ranging from 0 1, 0 1, 0 1 0 0.75, 0 1, 0 3 and 0 3. The food compositions contemplated herein are those food compositions which are ingestible by humans and in which the silicones described herein are substituted wholly, or in part, for the fats and oils normally used in such food compositions. Included, therefore, by way of example, are dairy products, baked goods, mayonnaise, sandwich spreads, peanut butter, cereals and the like. Also, some of the food compositions contemplated herein are those food compositions which are entirely, or nearly entirely composed of the silicones. Included, therefore, by way of example, are salad oils and shortenings. Also, food compositions contemplated herein are those food compositions which are prepared by the use of silicone fluid frying oils such as, for example, deep fried fish, vegetables, meats, potatoes fried foods and the like. It is also contemplated within the scope of this invention to include frying oils and the like which contain silicones as partial substitutes for the organic oils and fats. Not included in this invention are silicones which become part of foods at very low levels, i.e. substantially less than 0.1 weight percent, such as silicone based antifoams, release coatings in bakery goods, and the like. For purposes of this invention, the silicones can be described as polyorganosiloxanes. Aside from the purity expected in food grade substances, the polyorganosiloxanes of this invention are those which have an organic carbon content of at least fifteen 15 weight percent. Thus, included within the scope of this invention are those siloxanes having organic substitution wherein the organic substitution is linked to the silicon atom through a carbon silicon bond.Such a limitation distinguishes the siloxanes useful in this invention from those wherein there is no organic substitution such as partial hydrolyzates and condensates of Si OR 4 wherein R is an alkyl radical. Further, this invention contemplates small amounts of Si O C bonded materials wherein the hydrolyzable by products of such materials are not physiologically highly toxic to the human body, such as, for example, ethanol, glycerol, sucrose and other organic sugars. For example,EMI9.1 wherein OR is CH3CH2O , when hydrolyzed would give ethanol as a by product andEMI9.2 In order to minimize the possibility of absorption of the siloxanes in the stomach or intestines when the siloxanes are ingested, the siloxanes are preferred, for purposes of this invention, to have a molecular weight of at least 500 g mole.What is meant by having a molecular weight of at least 500 g mole is that the compositions should not contain significant amounts of material with molecular weights of less than 500 g mole. By significant , it is meant that there should be less than about 10 weight percent of such low molecular weight materials present in the composition, based on the total silicone present. Preferred for this invention are silicones that are essentially free of such low molecular weight materials The siloxanes of this invention need not necessarily be truly soluble or miscible with the other components of the foods in which they are being used since most food systems are heterogenous anyway. However, the siloxanes of this invention can be tailor made to be compatible with such foods because of the ability to change the type of molecule and because the molecules can be substituted by many variable R groups as shown below. The general formula for the siloxanes useful in this invention has been set forth above and it should be noted thatR can be individually selected from the group consisting of i C6H5 CH2 CH EMI10.1 iv a phenylethyl v B phenylethyl vii alkyl groups of I to 20 carbon atoms vii hydrogen viii hydroxyl ix R CH3 2SiO x R OOC CH2 h, wherein R1 is individually selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, an alkyl radical of 1 to 20 carbon atoms andC6H5 , wherein h is an integer of from 2 to 10 EMI10.2 wherein n and m each have an average value of from 0 to 25 and E is an integer of from 2 to 6 a, b, c, d, e, f and 2 have mole fraction values respectively ranging from 0 1, 0 1, 0 1, 0 0.75, 0 1, 0 3 and 0 3. Thus, the siloxanes can be polyorganosiloxanes or can be polyorganosiloxane organic copolymers. Further, A is a hydrolytically stable divalent hydrocarbon radical which is linked to silicon atoms by silicon carbon bonds. Thus, these siloxanes can be alkylene bridged polymers. The values of a, b, c, d, e, f, and q, as mole fractions range respectively from 0 1, 0 1, 0 1, 0 0.75, 0 1, 0 3 and 0 3. Thus, contemplated within the scope of this invention are such polyorganosiloxanes as I R3SiO1 2 a 0 R2SiO2 2 b 0 RSIO3 2 c 0 SiO4 2 d 0 RfSi 03 f A 03 g SiRg e 0 2 2 II R3SiO1 2 a 0 R2SiO2 2 b 0 RSIO3 2 c 0 SiO4 2 d 0 III R3SiO1 2 a 0 R2SiO2 2 b 0 RSIO3 2 c 0 IV R3SiO1 2 a 0 R2SiO2 2 b 0 V HO R2SiO2 2 b 0 H VI HO R2SiO2 2 b 0 RSiO3 2 c 0 H VII HO R2SiO2 2 b 0 RSiO3 2 c 0 SiO4 2 d 0H and, VIII HO R2SiO2 2 b 0 RSiO3 2 c 0 SiO4 2 d 0 Rf 0Si O3 f A O3 g SiRg 0 e 0H 2 2 Preferred for this invention are the polyorganosiloxanes I through VIII wherein the R groups are the lower alkyl groups. More preferred are the polyorganosiloxanes I through VIII wherein the R groups are methyl groups. Most preferred are the polyorganosiloxanes 11 , III and IV wherein the R groups are methyl groups. Also preferred for this invention are polyorganosiloxane organic copolymers having the formulas I through VIII wherein some of the R groups areEMI12.1 and the preponderance of the R groups are methyl groups. The most readily available commercial products for use in this invention are those polyorganosiloxanes having the general formula R3SiO R2SiO bSiR3 wherein R is independently selected from CH3 , CH3CH2 , C6H5and phenylethyl. Specifically, organopolysiloxanes which are highly preferred in this invention are those having the formula CH3 3SiO CH3 2SiO bSi CH3 3 wherein b has an average value of 25 to 500, resinous organopolysiloxanes having a degree of substitution number of organic group substitution on each silicon atom of 1.0 to 2.0 and are copolymers consisting of SiO2 units, CH3 3SiOl 2 units,CH3SiO3 2 units and Q CH3 2SiOl 2 units, wherein Q is a radical selected from a group consisting of hydrocarbon groups consisting of carboxyl, ester, amide, amino, mercapto, nitrile, nitro, carbonyl, alkyl groups containing from 3 to 20 carbon atoms and polyalkylene oxide polymers and copolymers containing either singly or in combination polyoxethylene, polyoxypropylene and polyoxybutylene units. Other readily available commercial products for use in this invention are those organopolysiloxane organic copolymers having the average structural formulae 1 RjSi OSi CH3 2 k OSiCH3G rOSi CH3 2G 4 j 2 G CH3 2Si OSi CH3 2 OSiCH3G 1OSi CH3 2G 3 CH3 3Si OSi CH3 2 k OSiCH3G qOSi CH3 3 and 4 RjSi OSi CH3 2 k OSiCH3G qSi CH3 3 4 j in which formulae R is a hydrocarbon radical and contains 1 to 10 carbon atoms G is a radical of the structure D OR tT wherein D is a alkylene radical R is composed of ethylene radicals and radicals selected from the group consisting of propylene and butylene radicals, the amount of ethylene radicals relative to the other alkylene radicals being such that the ratio of carbon atoms to oxygen atoms in the totalOR blocks ranges from 2.3 1 to 2.8 1 t has an average value from 25 to 100 T is a radical selected from the group consisting of the OR , OOCR and OC OOR radicals whereinR is a radical selected from the group consisting of hydrocarbon and hydrocarbonoxy radicals, the T radical containing a total of less than eleven atoms i has an average value of from 0 to 1 k has an average value of from 6 to 420 r has an average value of from 0 to 30 1 has an average value of from 1 to 30 and g has an average value of from 3 to 30 said copolymers containing at least 13 percent by weightOSi CH3 2 units based on the weight of the copolymer. Preferred for this invention are types 2 and 3 .Most preferred for this invention is type 3 . It is preferred for this invention that low molecular weight alkylene oxide polymers not be present in significant quantities, for example, not greater than 10 weight percent based upon the amount of siloxane polyalkylene oxide polymers used in the food composition. Further, less preferred materials are those wherein the polyalkylene oxide polymers and the siloxanes are connected by ESi O C bonds which are potentially hydrolyzable. The food compositions herein which contain the polyorganosiloxanes generally contain such polyorganosiloxanes in a quantity of 0.1 to 100 weight percent based on the total food composition. The amount of polyorganosiloxane that is required depends on the type of food composition.For example, if one wishes to replace the natural butter fat in whole milk with the polyorganosiloxanes of this invention, the amount of polyorganosiloxane used would be on the order of 0.5 3 weight percent, while replacing the shortening used in the preparation of pie crust could amount to several times that required for whole milk. Obviously, in preparing a salad oil, the polyorganosiloxanes of this invention could constitute nearly 100 of such a food composition. In using the organopolysiloxanes of this invention, one simply substitutes the organopolysiloxanes for all or some of the natural fat or oil of the food product. The method used often becomes one of conventional food preparation in which polyorganosiloxanes are simply added whenever the recipe calls for natural fats or oils. Sometimes, however, since the polyorganosiloxanes of this invention are not exactly equivalent in all regards to the natural fats and oils in many foods, one may need to add more or less polyorganosiloxanes. For example, some fats and oils act as emulsifiers and, when such a property is required to prepare foodstuff, adjustments in the quantity of the polyorganosiloxane used are required in order to ensure that an emulsion results. Most of the polyorganosiloxanes of this invention are commercially available and therefore their preparation is well known in the art and will not be set forth herein. For those polyorganosiloxanes that are not commercially available, their preparation can be found in the published literature, especially the patent literature. Thus, methods contemplated within the scope of this invention include such diverse things as immersing foods in hot polyorganosiloxanes i.e. deep frying dressing food with polyorganosiloxanes i.e. salad oil and salad dressing frying foods using the polyorganosiloxanes as frying oils production of dairy products such as cheese, cottage cheese, milk, ice cream, whipped cream and yogurt production of baked goods such as cakes, pie crusts, cookies, bread, cereal, doughnuts and crackers snackfoods such as potato chips, popcorn and corn chips shortening substitutes margarine mayonnaise salad dressing peanut butter low calorie or no calorie foods and the like. For purposes of this invention, hydrolytically stable means that bonds in the polyorganosiloxane are stable to conditions in which an sSi O C bond is normally susceptible to hydrolytic cleavage. Major ingredients for purposes of this invention means at least 2 percent by weight of the total food composition. Now, so that those skilled in the art appreciate and understand the invention set forth in the claims hereto, the following examples are given.

APPENDIX G ANALYTICAL METHODThe analytical results were obtained by the following methods.Sampling Procedures Muffins The muffins were quartered vertically and two opposing quarters were used in each analysis approximately 50 gl. Cookies Three cookies were stacked up and quartered. Two opposing quarters of each cookie were used in each analysis approximately 39 g . Ice Cream A notch was taken from the brick of ice cream by making two cuts approximately 3 4 apart and approximately 1 in from the brick end. The cuts extended beyond the center of the brick and resulted in a sample of approximately 50 g. A second notch was taken in the same brick but 1 from the other end and with the brick inverted. These two Samples were combined for one analysis of the brick.Analytical Method The sample was weighed and blended with 500 ml of methylisobutylketone MIBK solvent. This blend was allowed to stand overnight. Two hundred ml of water was added and the mixture was stirred vigorously for approximately 1 hour. Then 10 ml concentrated HC1 was added and again the mixture was stirred for 1 2 1 hour. Approximately 30 ml of the MIBK phase was withdrawn from the mixture and centrifuged. A five ml aliquot of the clear supernatant solvent extract was diluted to 250 ml in fresh MIBK and this solution was analyzed for Si content by atomic absorption spectroscopy. No silicon was detected in the control samples using this method i.e. less than 20 ppm .

Peanut butter was prepared using the formula of one cup of Planters brand dry roasted peanuts and 1 3 4 tablespoons of soybean oil foodgrade from Crisco. A. The peanuts were ground up in a CuisinartE brand food processor until they were fine grained. One tablespoon of the vegetable oil was added and the processing was continued for a few seconds whereupon a butter like material formed. An additional 3 4 of a tablespoon of vegetable oil was added to the butter like material and the butter was completely formed. The peanut butter was not as smooth as national brands of commercial peanut butter but was similar in taste and texture. B. The above process was carried out except that 1 1 2 tablespoons of a polyorganosiloxane having a viscosity of twenty centistokes and having the average formula CH3 3sio CH3 ,siol2 Si CH3 3 was substituted for the vegetable oil in A. and the silicone oil was added in 1 2 tablespoon increments. The result was a somewhat drier looking peanut butter which had a taste and texture similar to the product of A. .Example 2 The preparation of mayonnaise using a silicone oil. A control mayonnaise was prepared which had the following formula 1 egg 1 tablespoon lemon juice 1 2 teaspoon dry mustard 1 tablespoon vinegar 1 4 teaspoon paprika 1 cup CriscoS vegetable oil The egg, mustard, paprika, lemon juice, vinegar and 1 4 cup of vegetable oil were combined in a Hamilton BeachScoville blender. The ingredients were throughly mixed at the blend setting for about 5 seconds. Three fourths of a cup of vegetable oil was then added slowly while continuing to blend. The mixture was blended for about ten seconds after the addition was complete. The taste of the resulting product was quite bland compared to commercial mayonnaise because of the lack of salt in the formula. The consistency of the product was a bit less than the commercial product, but it was very acceptable.The appearance coloring was very close to commercial mayonnaise off white . A second material was prepared as above except that the oil used consisted of 1 4 cup vegetable oil added initially and 3 4 cup of silicone oil as used in example 1 was added subsequently. After final blending, the product was indistinguishable in taste, consistency and appearance, from the control.Example 3 An attempt was made to substitute the silicone oil as used in example 1 for all of the vegetable oil, in the preparation of mayonnaise. The formula used was the same as was used in example 2 except that the vegetable oil was entirely replaced by the silicone oil. The procedure of example 2 was used and 1 4 cup of polyorganosiloxane oil was first added, then subsequently, the remaining 3 4 cup of polyorganosiloxane oil was added.The taste of this product was very similar to the above products while the overall consistency was slightly less than the above products, but very acceptable. The color was a significantly deeper yellow, indicating a color enhancement on the part of the silicone oil.Example 4 Use of a silicone oil in popped corn. Commercial popcorn about 1 2 cup was placed in an electrically heated skillet and wetted with a trimethylsiloxyendblocked polydimethylsiloxane fluid having an average formula of CH3 3SiO CH3 2SiO167Si CH3 3. The skillet was heated to 1750C and held there until almost all of the corn had popped. The corn was successfully popped without burning and when the product was flavored using a commercial butter flavored salt, it was crisp and tasty.Example 5 A salad dressing based on a silicone fluid was prepared by mixing Good Seasons brand dry mix Italian style, with vinegar and a silicone oil, The silicone oil is a trimethyls i loxyendblocked polydimethylsiloxane having the formula found in example 1. Normally, the ratio of such vinegar water vegetable oil mixture is about 10 15 75 by volume. The vinegar and water are mixed, the dry mix is added and shaken and then the vegetable oil is added and the total shaken to provide a poor dispersion. When using a silicone oil as described above, the ratio vinegar water oil is about 10 15 50, a much more stable dispersion is formed, which can be used in place of the conventional salad oil and vinegar dressing.Example 6 General food items were deep fried using a trimethylsiloxy endblocked polydimethylsiloxane fluid as found in Example 4. The food items were French fries Egg rolls Potato skins Beef Steak Chicken parts Char Sui Fish Fish cakes Won tons Onion rings Each of the items cooked quickly, had an aesthetically pleasing appearance, did not burn, and was not excessively greasy . The taste was excellent in each case.When a siloxane oil having the average formula CH3 3SiOl CH3 2SiO 135Si CH3 3 was substituted for the first siloxane oil, the results were essentially the same.Example 7 Food items are stir fried in a Chinese Wok cooker using the fluids identified in example 6. The food items were Meat Bok choy Carrots Pouitry Bean Sprouts Green Peppers Shrimp Mushrooms Onions Broccoli Water Chestnuts Apples Pea pods Nuts Tomatoes Beans Celery These items were cooked quickly, the vegetables retained good color and the items were tasty.Example 8 Standard white layer cakes were prepared using theAmerican Association of Cereal Chemists method 10 90,Appendix A. All silicones were trimethylsiloxyendblocked polydimethylsiloxanes. The variables studied included A. The replacement of 50 of the fat required in the cake recipe using silicone oils of i Example 4 ii Example 6 iii CH3 3SiO CH3 2SiO 2235i CH3 3 iv An aqueous emulsion containing 35 by weight of a polydimethylsiloxane having about 350cs viscosity. v An aqueous emulsion containing by weight of a polydimethylsiloxane having about 350 cs viscosity. B. The straight substitution of 100 of the fat required in the cake recipe using silicone oils of i Example 8 A iii ii An aqueous emulsion containing 60 by weight of a polydimethylsiloxane having about 350 cs viscosity. C. The substitution of 50 of the fat required in the cake recipe using the silicone oil of Example 8 A iii and added commercial emulsifiers i Myvatex 2 ii Stearolac 0.5 . D. The substitution of 100 of the fat required in the cake recipe using the silicone oil of Example 8 A iii and added commercial emulsifiers i Myvates 2 ii Stearolac S 0.5 iii Vanall 2 . E. The substitution of 1008 of the fat required in the cake recipe using the silicone oil of Example 8 a iii wherein there is a variation in the mixing method. fun The reduction of all the fat required in the recipe to 80 and the substitution of the remaining 20 with the silicone oil of Example 8 A iii . G. The reduction of all of the fat required in the recipe to 90 and the substitution of the remaining 10 with the silicone oil of Example 8 A iii plus the use ofSolkafloc 5 . H.

L. i decreased required quantity by 20 ii xanthan gum to 0.9 iii Tween 80 to 70 iv Span 20 to 7 . In all cases, cakes were achieved indicating that silicone fluids can be substituted for normal fats used in baking cakes. No attempt was made to optimize the formulas shown above. Generally, these experimental cakes had some loss of aeration and higher specific gravities with some loss in volume. Crust color was unaffected but crumbs were darker.Tenderness was relatively unaffected. When the mixing method was modified wherein the egg white was prefoamed before addition, the specific gravity and volume were enhanced with some coarse cells. Decreasing the original fat by 20 and complete substitution of the remaining oil produced cakes with improved texture.Example 9 Chiffon Cake Chiffon cake was prepared using a formulation fromJoy of Cooking, 1975 Appendix B using the complete substitution of silicone oil of example 6 for vegetable oil, in addition to the control. Depression of volume and coarse cell structure was noted in the silicone containing cake.Color was simiLar to the control. Tenderness was slightly less in the substituted cake, although quite acceptable.Example 10 Pie System Pie pastry was prepared following the AmericanAssociation of Cereal Chemists Method 10 60 and the Experimental Study of Food Appendix C using the following series of variables in addition to the control A Complete replacement of fat by 100 of its weight of i Silicone oil of Example 4 ii Silicone oil of Example 6 iii Silicone oil of Example 8 A iii B. Complete replacement of fat by 80 of its weight of i Silicone oil of Example 4 ii Silicone oil of Example 8 A iii All of the silicone substitutions resulted in pastries comparable to the control in flakiness and appearance. Tenderness decreased in the pastry containing B. i , while the B. ii variable was comparable to the control.AACC Method 10 60 was modified to reduce water required, dough holding time and baking time to improve the final product. Cherry pie was attempted using pie pastry with the silicone oil of Example 6 at 100 substitution. The pastry functioned well and seepage of liquid from the fruit filling into the crust was minimal.Example 11 Chocolate Chip Cookies Chocolate chip cookies following the Nestle cookie formulation Appendix D were prepared using the complete substitution of silicone dl of example 8 A iii for margarine used in the control. No adjustment was made for the fat water ratio of margarines. Substitution was successful in chocolate chip cookies. Moisture loss during baking was 6.7 for both types of cookies. Appearance was similar in both cookies, though the cookie containing silicone had a shiny surface and the chocolate chips appeared to be more prominent. The appearance was desirably enhanced. The silicone containing cookie was less tender than the control by objective measurement 36.3 lb g versus 16.4 lb g , though sensory analysis did not note such a great difference. Taste was comparable.Example 12 Oatmeal Cookies Oatmeal cookies following the Quaker Oats formulation Appendix E were prepared with complete substitution of the silicone oil of Example 8 A iii for the vegetable shortening used in the controL. Appearance of both cookies was similar and characteristic of an oatmeal cookie. The silicone containing cookie was less tender 48.9 lb g as compared to the control 36.7 lb g by both objective and subjective measurement, though it was not unacceptable. The substituted cookie was more chewy. The color of the cookies was similar. Baking losses were 10.2 for the cookie containing silicone oil and 11.2 for the control. A second series of oatmeal cookies was prepared using complete substitution with the silicone fluid of example 6. This batter containing silicone oil was less viscous and darker but the baked cookies were similar in sheen, spread and baking losses. Although the cookie containing silicone fluid was again slightly less tender, it was evident that highly acceptable drop cookies can indeed be prepared with silicone oils.Example 13 Muffin System Blueberry muffins following the Jordan MarshDepartment Store formulation Appendix F were prepared using the complete substitution of the silicone fluid of example 8 A iii for margarine without adjustment for fat water proportion in margarine. Substitution was highly successful in the muffins. The blueberries were very prominent making the substitute muffins attractive. No objective measurements were conducted. Informal visual and sensory observations noted muffins with volume, color and cell structure characteristics similar to those of the control. Baking moisture loss was less 12.9 for the muffin containing silicone oil than for the control muffins 19.6 . A substitution for fat with the silicone oil of example 4 with no adjustment for water was attempted and also proved very successful. Muffins were also prepared using the silicone oil of example 6 and adjusting for the fat water preparation in the margarine at both the 50 and 100 level of substitution.Both products were highly acceptable, had good volume and blueberries again rose to the surface but were not as prominent as in the first series with excess silicone oil. Example 14 Nutrient Calculations The recipe calculation routine of the MichiganState University Nutrient Data Bank was used to determine the calories and amount in grams of silicone fat per serving of a variety of products. The weight of silicone was substituted with water to keep the total formula weight constant. These calculations which are presented in Table I show that there was a reduction in calories of one quarter to over one half with 100 substitution of silicone oil for fat in these products.Example 15 The Michigan State University Nutrient Data Bankwas also used to calculate selected nutrient contents of blueberry muffins and chocolate chip cookies. These data are summarized in Table II. Slight changes in carbohydrate and protein content resulted since the fat source in these products was margarine. The major change in nutrient composition, however, was the reduction in fat and calories as silicone oils were substituted for margarine.Example 16 Frozen desserts were prepared using the silicone oil of example 1 as a direct substitution for the milkfat in the recipe. Preliminary work indicated that lQ0 percent substitution of milkfat with the silicone oil yielded an ice cream type product very close in quality to a product prepared with only a 50 percent rate of substitutionTherefore, the 100 percent substitution of milkfat was used for subsequent studies. Characteristics of substituted products causing problems in preliminary studies included 1 a depression of overrun air entrainment , 2 difficulty with the emulsification of the silicone fluids into the mix, 3 a coating of the mouth and lips during sensory evaluation, 4 shrinkage of the product in the container, 5 icy texture formation during storage, and 6 crumbly body defects in the final product. Another characteristic identified was the apparent enhancement of flavors, especially sweetness, found in substituted products. The formulations for the control product and the substituted product were as follows Weight Fat MSNFÚ Sugar SEê TS Ingredients gms gms gms gms gms gms Cream 40 Fat 5.4 MSNF 25.00 10.00 1.35 11.35NFDMS 4 96 MSNF 4.91 4.71 4.71Skim milk 9 MSNF 54.89 4.94 15.00Sugar 100 Solids 15.00 15.00 15.00S.E. 100 Solids 5 0.25 0.25 0.25Total Weight 100.00 10.00 11.00 15.00 0.25 36.25Percent 100.00 10.00 11.00 15.00 0.25 36.25 Milk solids non fat approximately 55 Lactose, 37 Protein and 8 Ash 2Stabilizer Emulisfier Solids Total Solids 4Non Fat, dry milk solids 5Stabilizer Emulisifier Preparation Kontrol, Germantown Mfg.

Sodium siliconate aluminate added for anti caking properties. 6For 100 substitution formula see Appendix H The frozen dessert prepared with silicone fluid substituted for 100 percent of the milk fat showed definite improvements in characteristics however the overall character of the product approximates that of a good ice milk rather than a good ice cream. The most dramatic factor of the substituted product has been the reduction in caloric content in comparison to the control. Table IV shows that although slightly denser per serving, the reduction in caloric value is 51 percent.The calorie content of this product is approximately equal to that of fruit flavored yogurt and the substituted product has a much greater dessert or snack appeal.Example 17 Preliminary work in the manufacture of cheese curd from filled milk prepared using 100 percent substitution of milkfat with silicone oil indicated that a curd with proper body and texture was feasible. Dagano cheese was selected as the experimental cheese type due to its relatively rapid ripening period of 27 35 days and the potential for visual evidence of starter bacteria activity. The visual evidence of starter activity is found in the formation of gas holes in this Swiss type cheese. The procedure for the manufacture of Dagano cheese may be found in Appendix I. The gross composition of the milk and filled milk used for Dagano cheese preparation is shown in Table V. All milks were pasteurized at 1450F for 30 minutes and the filled milk was homogenized at 3000 psi. The calculated composition of Dagano cheese is shown in Table VI. The Dagano cheese prepared with the silicone fluid filled milk attained very acceptable body and texture characteristics after 5 weeks of aging. Gas holes were of normal proportions for Dagano cheese. The gas holes tended to arrange themselves in two rows rather than being randomly spaced in the cheese. This alignment likely resulted from the method of packing curds in the hoop and could easily be remedied. The filled milk cheese had excellent slicing qualities and showed no visible free silicone fluid on the cut surface. Example 18 Several materials falling within the scope of the formula of claim 1 were investigated for their usefulness in a cookie recipe. The cookies were prepared from the following recipe. It should be noted that the formulations were not optimized and that this example was a screening test for cookie preparation.

Using a General Electrics hand mixer, the silicone sub stance, water, granulated sugar, brown sugar and vanilla were beaten for 30 seconds using low. The bowl and beaters were scraped. Beating was continued for an additional 30 seconds after which the bowl and beaters were scraped again.3. The egg was added and mixing continued on low speed for 25 seconds. The bowl and beaters were again scraped.4. The dry ingredients were added over 15 seconds with the mixer operating at low speed. The bowl and beaters were scraped after which the mixture was beaten at low speed for 15 seconds and again scraped.5. At this point the mixture was too dry to form into cookie balls so 5.67 ml of additional water was added and mixing continued for 15 seconds. An additional 5 ml of water was again added so that a cookie dough consistency was formed.6. The chocolate chips were added and the mixture beaten for 15 seconds using speed 1.7. The cookies were shaped into balls of approximated 25 grams and placed on parchment paper squares. This yielded 10 cookies per batch.8. The cookies were baked on aluminum baking sheets in an Etco forced convection oven set at 3750 F for 9 minutes. The cookies were cooled on wire racks for 10 minutes before the parchment paper was removed. After cooling an additional 20 minutes, the cookies were placed in polyethylene ZiplocS storage bags, overwrapped with foil and stored at 0 F.
