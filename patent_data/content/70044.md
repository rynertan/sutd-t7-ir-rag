# Hydraulically operated impact motor.

## Abstract
An hydraulically operated impact motor, for example a jack hammer, has a hammer piston 12 with a single land 18 . The hammer piston surfaces 19, 20 of the land 18 form two cylinder chambers 21, 22 together with the cylinder of the piston. The rear cylinder chamber 21 is constantly pressurized by the pump pressure and the front cylinder chamber 22 is periodically pressurized and drained by means of a valve 28 . The valve 28 is controlled by two control passages 32, 41 that have ports 33, 34 and 47 50 respectively into the cylinder and conveys the control pressure to valve shifting piston surfaces 30, 39 . The larger one 39 of the valve shifting piston surfaces 30, 39 is the end surface of a plunger 36 and an intermediate chamber 35 is formed between the plunger 36 and the valve spool 28 . The intermediate chamber 35 is constantly pressurized through a passage 54 . Internal leak passages 52, 55 in the valve spool makes the valve spool stable in its two positions.
