Unsubstituted hydroxybiphenyl as well as many of the substituted hydr ybiphenyl starting materials, are commercially available.Alternatively, appropriately substituted hydroxybiphenyls can be obtained by well known synthetic procedures described in the chemical literature. In general, synthesis of hydroxybiphenyls can be accomplished by the same types of reactions by which phenols can be obtained from benzenoid starting materials. In addition, specific descriptions of these and other syntheses of hydroxybiphenyls are well described in the chemical literature. One method for the synthesis of substituted biphenyl compounds is the coupling together of two suitably substituted benzenoid compounds, as described in The Chemistry of CarbonCompounds by E.H. Rodd, 1st Edition, Vol. IIIB, p 1029, 2nd Edition, Vol. III F, p 1, and in Chemical Reviews, 1964, p 613.These references describe the syntheses of a number of substituted hydroxybiphenyls and, in addition, the syntheses of a large number of diversely substituted biphenyl compounds which can, by methods well known to those skilled in the art, be converted into substituted hydroxybiphenyls. For example, the above references describe the preparation of many alkoxy substituted biphenyls which can, by means of well known dealkylation reactions, as described in SyntheticOrganic Chemistry, by R.B. Wagner and H.D. Zook, p 171, be converted into substituted hydroxybiphenyls.Similarly, amino substituted biphenyls can be converted into the corresponding substituted hydroxybiphenyls by means of well known diazotization reactions which are described in Synthetic Organic Chemistry, bid., p 168.The substituted amino biphenyls used for the above diazotization reactions can be obtained by reduction of the corresponding substituted nitrobiphenyls, preparations of which are described in The Chemistry ofCarbon Compounds and in Chemical Reviews, referenced above. Using the above described procedures, and others well known to those skilled in the art, hydroxybiphenyls bearing alkyl, halo and alkoxy substituents, and combinations of these substituents, can be made. In addition, hydroxybiphenyls bearing halogen substituents can be made by direct halogenation of hydroxybiphenyls, as described in the Journal of the American ChemicalSociety, 1934, Vol. 56, p. 202.Many hydroxybiphenyls, especially those bearing alkyl substituents, can also be made by palladium catalysed coupling reactions between an appropriately substituted bromobenzene and an appropriately substituted phenylboronic acid, as described in Synthetic Communications, 1981, Vol. 11, p.513, followed by a dealkylation reaction, as described above, to liberate the substituted hydroxybiphenyl.Reactions of this type are described in Preparations 1 4 below. To prepare the compounds of the invention, the optionally substituted hydroxybiphenyl of Formula A is first converted to the corresponding compound of FormulaB wherein M is a functional group such as halo, alkyl or aryl sulfonyloxy, formyl, cyano, carbamoyl or thiocarbamoyl, amino, aminoalkyl, or nitro and k is an integer of 2 11 when M is formyl, cyano, carbamoyl, or thiocarbamoyl, or 3 12 when M is halo, alkyl or aryl sulfonyloxy, amino, aminoalkyl, nitro, by reaction with a compound of the Formula M CH2 k L wherein L is a leaving group such as halo or sulfonate, and M and k are as defined above, as shown in Reaction Scheme II Reaction Scheme IIEMI9.1 The compound of Formula A is reacted with about 1.0 1.3, preferably about 1.05, molar equivalents of the compound of Formula M CH2 kL in a polar aprotic organic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, formamide, or, preferably, N,N dimethylformamide. The reaction takes place in the presence of from one to five molar equivalents of an inorganic base such as sodium hydroxide, or, preferably, about 5 molar equivalents of potassium carbonate. The reaction is conducted at a temperature of about 25 1250C, preferably about 700C, over a period of about 2 48 hours, preferably about 22 26 hours. The resulting product of Formula B is isolated by conventional means. The products of the reactions described herein can be isolated and purified by any suitable separation or purification procedure, such as, for example, filtration, extraction, crystallization, column chromatography, thin layer chromatography, thick layer chromatography, preparative low or high pressure liauid chromatography, or a combination of these procedures. Specific illustrations are described in the Examples. However, other equivalent separation or purification procedures can be used. The compounds of Formula B are then converted to the desired compounds of Formula I by modifying the side chain following the methods commonly used for the preparation of amines and which are described, for example, in Compendium of Organic Synthetic Methods, byI. T. Harrison and S. Harrison, Volume 1, pps. 230 270, or in Synthetic Organic Chemistry, by R. B. Wagner and H.D. Zook, pps. 653 728, or in other standard text books of organic chemistry. Some examples of the nature of the functional group M, and the type of reactions required to convert it into the group B, are shown in Table 1, which is not an exhaustive list.

When M is halo, alkyl or aryl sulfonyloxy group, the compounds of Formula I are prepared by treating the optionally substituted compound of Formula B with a compound with the Formula HX, thereby converting the halo or alkyl or aryl sulfonyloxy group to the corresponding nitrogen containing substituents. To carry out this conversion, the compound of Formula B is dissolved in and reacted with a solution of 5 25 molar equivalents of the appropriate cyclic or acyclic amine, preferably acyclic, and most preferably N,N dimethylamine.

When M is formyl, reductive amination is performed by reacting together the formyl compound, the amine component HX, and a reducing agent such as molecular hydrogen and a catalyst, active metals and acids, formic acid, or a cyanoborohydride salt.

When M is cyano, reduction of the nitrile compound to produce a primary amine can be effected by the use of hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst such as nickel or palladium. The reaction is conducted in an organic solvent such as ethanol methanol and the like, at from 0 C to 600C, preferably about 250C using from 1 to 100, preferably about 5 atmospheres pressure of hydrogen.Alternatively, the reduction can be effected by a reducing agent such as lithium aluminum hydride, in an inert organic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran or 1,2 dimethoxyethane, at from OOC to reflux temperature, preferably at about 250C. The reduction can also be effected by the use of an alkali metal such as sodium in an alcoholic solvent such as methanol, at from about 250C to reflux temperature, preferably at reflux temperature. Compounds in which M is carbamoyl or thiocarbamoyl can be reduced to the corresponding amines by the use of a reducing agent such as lithium aluminum hydride or diborane. The reaction is conducted in an inert organic solvent such as ether or tetrahydrofuran, at from about OOC to reflux temperature, preferably at about 250C. When M is NH2, NH alkyl, primary or secondary amines can be alkylated to afford secondary or tertiary amines by reaction with an alkyl halide phosphate or sulfonate in an organic or aqueous organic solvent in which the organic component is a water miscible solvent such as ethanol or tetrahydrofuran. The reaction is conducted at from about 250C to 1500C, optionally under a pressure of from 1 to 50 atmospheres. Alternatively, the alkylation can be performed by reacting the amine starting material with the appropriate aluminum alkoxide in a sealed tube at a temperature of from 1000C to 3500C, preferably at about 2500C. When M is the nitro group, reduction of nitro compounds to the corresponding primary amines can be effected by the use of tin and a mineral acid such as hydrochloric acid, by zinc or aluminum amalgam in aqueous ethanol or aqueous methanol, at a temperature of from about 500C to reflux, preferably at reflux temperature.Alternatively, the reduction can be performed by the use of lithium aluminum hydride in an inert solvent such as ether or tetrahydrofuran, at from OoC to reflux temperature, preferably at about 250C. Alternatively, the reduction can be performed by the use of hydrogen and a nickel, platinum or palladium catalyst, in a solvent such as ethanol or benzene, at from OOC to 500C, preferably at about 250C, at a pressure of from 1 to 50 atmospheres, preferably about 5 atmospheres of hydrogen. Compounds of Formula I wherein B is NH2 are preferably prepared by converting the compound of FormulaB to the corresponding phthalimide compound of Formula C, and then hydrolyzing the phthalimide grouD, as shown in the following Reaction Scheme III Reaction Scheme IIIEMI14.1 wherein X, Y, a, b and n are as defined above and MT is halo. In carrying out this conversion, the compound ofFormula B is dissolved in an inert aprotic organic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, formamide, or preferably, N,N dimethylformamide. To this solution is added about 1.0 1.5, preferably about 1.05, molar equivalents of a metal salt of phthalimide, preferably potassium phthalimide. The reaction mixture is heated to about 60 1350C, preferably about 1300C, for 1 24 hours, preferably about 8 hours. The product of Formula C, N 2 , 3 , or 4 biphenyloxyalkyl phthalimide, may be isolated by conventional means. It is then reacted with about 1 5, preferably about 1.5, molar equivalents of hydrazine, in a polar organic or aqueous organic solvent such as methanol or, preferably, aqueous ethanol. The reaction is maintained at from about 250C to reflux temperature, preferably at reflux temperature, for about 1 12, preferably about 3 hours. The resulting optionally substituted 2 , 3 , 4 biphenyloxyalkylamine compound of Formula I is then isolated by conventional means and, if desired, may be converted to a corresponding pharmaceutically acceptable salt. In addition, compounds of this invention can be prepared by the alkylation reaction between hydroxybiphenyl, or asubstituted hydroxybiphenyl, and an amine compound as described in the following ReactionScheme IV REACTION SCHEME IVEMI15.1 wherein X, Y, a, b, B, n, and L are all as defined earlier and the reaction can be carried out using the conditions described for the preparation of the compound of Formula B in Reaction Scheme II.

One example of this process is illustrated in the following reaction EMI16.1 The compounds of this invention wherein B is NHR1 and R1 is alkyl or cycloalkyl can be prepared by the following methods EMI17.1 wherein X, Y, a, b and n are as defined above, and R1 is alkyl or cycloalkyl.When R4 is a group susceptible to hydrogenolysis, such as, mono , di , or triarylmethyl, or arylmethoxycarbonyl, i.e., ArCH2 , Ar2CH ,Ar3C , or ArCH20CO in which Ar is aromatic or heteroaromatic group such as phenyW, optionally substituted with one or more substituents such as alkyl or alkoxy, the conversion is carried out in an alcoholic solvent such as methanol or ethanol, with from 1 to 10 by weight of a catalyst such as 5 palladium on carbon, at from OOC to 600C, preferably about 250C for from 1 to 48 hours. 4 When R is a group susceptible to hydrolysis, such as COR5 wherein R is alkyl, aryl or heteroaryl, optionally substituted with one or more groups such as halo, alkyl or alkoxy, the conversion can be carried out in a water miscible organic solvent such as methanol, ethanol, tetrahydrofuran etc., in the presence of from 1 to 5 molar equivalents of an inorganic base such as sodium or potassium hydroxide and from 10 to 90S by volume of water, at from 250C to reflux temperature, for 1 to 24 hours. The substituents X and Y on the compound of FormulaI can be modified by conventional chemical reactions, for example, a compound in which X is bromo can be changed into a compound in which X is chloro by reaction with copper chloride in a high boiling amide solvent such asN,N dimethylformamide or N methylpyrrolidinone, at a temperature of from about 1000C to reflux temperature, preferably at reflux temperature. A halo substituent can also be replaced by hydrogen by means of a reductive dehalogenation reaction. This reaction can be effected by means of hydrogenation in the pressure of a metal catalyst such as nickel or palladium, in an organic solvent such as ethanol or acetic acid, at a temperature of from about 250C to 100 C, preferably at about 250C. Alternatively, the halogen substituent can be removed by reaction with Raney nickel alloy in aqueous sodium or potassium hydroxide, at a temperature of from about 250C to 100 C, preferably at about 500C.Alternatively, the halogen substituent can be removed by reduction using lithium aluminum hydride in an inert organic solvent such as ether or tetrahydrofuran, at a temperature of from about OOC to 500C, preferably at about 350C. All of the compounds of Formula I may be converted to their acid addition salts, by virtue of the presence of the amine terminating the alkyl side chain. The compounds of Formula I in free base form may be converted to the acid addition salts by treating with a stoichiometric excess of the appropriate organic or inorganic acid, such as, for example, phosphoric, citric, pyruvic, hydrochloric or sulfuric acid and the like. Typically, the free base is dissolved in a polar organic solvent such as ethanol or methanol, and the acid added thereto. The temperature is maintained at between about OOC and 500C. The resulting acid addition salt precipitates spontaneously or may be brought out of solution with a less polar solvent. The acid addition salts of the compounds ofFormula I may be decomposed to the corresponding free bases by treating with a stoichiometric excess of a suitable base, such as potassium carbonate or sodium hydroxide, typically in the presence of aqueous solvent, and at a temperature of between about OOC and 500C. The free base form is isolated by conventional means, such as extraction with an organic solvent. Salts of the compounds of Formula I may be interchanged by taking advantage of differential solubilities of the salts, volatilities or acidities of the acids, or by treating with the appropriately loaded ion exchange resin. For example, the interchange is effected by the reaction of a salt of a compound ofFormula I with a slight stoichiometric excess of an acid of a lower pKa than the acid component of the starting salt. This conversion is carried out at a temperature between about OOC and the boiling point of the solvent being used as the medium for the procedure.Utility and Administration The compounds of Formula I have been shown in standard laboratory tests to inhibit inflammation in mammals. Accordingly, the compounds of Formula I, their salts, and pharmaceutical compositions containing them, may be used in inhibiting, preventing, or controlling inflammation in mammals. Anti inflammatory activity can be determined by the method described by C. M. Pearson in Proc.Soc.Exp.Biol.Med., 91 95 101, 1956 utilizing adjuvant induced arthritis in rats. This method is described in detail in Example 17 hereinbelow. In addition, acute inflammatory activity can be determined by inhibition of carrageenan induced pleural inflammation in rats as described in the Proceedings of the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine, 1968, Vol. 127, D.597 and the Journal of Pharmacology and ExperimentalTherapeutics, 1969, Vol 168, p. 199. or by inhibition of topical inflammation caused by croton oil, arachidonic acid or oxazolone. Anti inflammatory activity can also be determined by in vitro biological assays in which the ability of the compounds to inhibit chemotaxis, as described in the Journal of Experimental Medicine, 1962,Vol 115, p. 453, or to inhibit the enzyme phospholipaseA2, or to inhibit the generation of superoxide from polymorphonuclear leucocytes are tested. The compounds of Formula I may also be useful in preventing, relieving or controlling the associated pain of various inflammatory conditions. The compounds of Formula I also are useful in inhibiting certain dermalogical conditions, such as psoriasis. The anti psoriatic activity can be determined by the method described by K. J. Dumas et al in Acta dermatovener Stockholm , 55 43 48 1972 . Administration of the active compounds and salts described herein can be effected via any medically acceptable mode of administration for agents which control inflammation and associated pain. These methods include but are not limited to oral, parenteral and otherwise systemic, or topical routes of administration.Oral or topical administration is preferred, depending of course, on the disorder being treated. The compounds are administered in a therapeutically effective amount either alone or in combination with a suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipient. Depending on the intended mode of administration, the compounds of this invention may be incorporated in any pharmaceutically acceptable dosage form, such as, for example, tablets, suppositories, pills, capsules, powders, liquids, suspensions, emulsions, aerosols, or the like. Preferable means of administration are unit dosage forms suitable for single administration of precise dosages, or sustained release dosage forms for continuous administration. Preferably the dosage form will include a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient and an active compound of Formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and, in addition, may include other medicinal agents, pharmaceutical agents, carriers, excipients, adjuvants, stabilizers, etc.Depending on parameters such as mode of administration, type of composition, and activity of the compound, the pharmaceutical composition may contain 1 99 percent by weight active ingredient with the remainder being excipient. For solid dosage forms, non toxic solid carriers include but are not limited to, for example, pharmaceutical grades of mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharin, the polyalkylene glycols, talcum, cellulose, glucose, sucrose, and magnesium carbonate. An example of a solid dosage form of the compounds of this invention is a suppository containing propylene glycol as the carrier. Liquid pharmaceutically administerable dosage forms can, for example, comprise a solution or suspension of an active compound as defined above and optional pharmaceutical adjuvants in a carrier, such as, for example, water, saline, aqueous dextrose, glycerol, ethanol, and the like, to thereby form a solution or suspension.If desired, the pharmaceutical composition to be administered may also contain minor amounts of nontoxic auxiliary substances such as wetting or emulsifying agents, pH buffering agents and the like. Typical examples of such auxiliary agents are sodium acetate, sorbitan monolaurate, triethanolamine sodium acetate, triethanolamine oleate, etc. Actual methods of preparing such dosage forms are known, or will be apparent, to those skilled in this art for example, see Reminoton s Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Company, Easton,Pennsylvania, 16th Edition, 1980. The composition or formulation to be administered will, in any event, contain a quantity of the active compound s in an amount effective to alleviate the symptoms of the subject being treated. For oral administration, a pharmaceutically acceptable non toxic dosage form may contain any of the normally employed excipients, such as, for example pharmaceutical grades of mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharin, talcum, cellulose, glucose, sucrose, magnesium carbonate, and the like.Such compositions take the form of solutions, suspensions, tablets, pills, capsules, powders, sustained release formulations and the like. Such dosage forms may contain 1 99X active ingredient, preferably 25 70 . For topical administration, an appropriate dosage form will comprise an effective amount of a compound ofFormula I in admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable non toxic carrier. A suitable range of composition would be 0 1 10 , preferably 1 2 , active ingredient, and the balance carrier. The concentration of active ingredient in pharmaceutical compositions suitable for topical application will vary depending upon the therapeutic activity of the particular active ingredient and the medical condition to be treated. Suitable dosage forms for topical application of the compounds of this invention include but are not limited to creams, ointments, lotions, emulsions and solutions. For example, a suitable ointment for topical application of compounds of the instant invention may contain 15 45 by weight of a saturated fatty alcohol having 16 to 24 carbon atoms, such as cetyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, behenyl alcohol, and the like, and 4585 of a glycol solvent such as propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, and mixtures thereof.In addition, the ointment may contain 0 15 by weight of a plasticizer e.g., polyethylene glycol, 1,2,6 hexanetriol, sorbitol, glycerol, and the like , 0 15 by weight of a coupling agent such as a saturated fatty acid having from 16 to 24 carbon atoms, e.g., stearic acid, palmitic acid or behenic acid a fatty acid amide e.g., oleamide, palmitamide, stearamide or behenamide or an ester of a fatty acid having from 16 to 24 carbon atoms, e.g., sorbitol monostearate, polyethylene glycol monostearate, polypropylene glycol or the corresponding mono ester of other fatty acids such as oleic acid and palmitic acid , and 0 20 by weight of a penetrant such as dimethyl sulfoxide or dimethylacetamide. The amount of active compound administered will, of course, depend on the subject being treated, the severity of the affliction, the manner of administration and the judgment of the prescribing physician. However, a therapeutically effective dosage of compounds of the instant invention is in the range of 1 100 mg kg day, preferably about 10 30 mg kg day, and most preferably about 25 mg kg day. For an average 70 kg human, this would amount to 70 mg 7 g per day, or preferably about 1.5 g day.Preferred Embodiments A preferred group of the family of compounds of this invention are those compounds of Formula I wherein B is NR1R2 where Rl and R2 are each independently hydrogen, methyl or ethyl.

In a similar manner, all compounds of Formula I in free base form may be converted to the acid addition salts by treatment with the appropriate acid, for example, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, glycolic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, malic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, mandelic acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, p toluenesulfonic acid, and the like. EXAMPLE 7 Conversion of Salt to Free Base 1.0 g of 6 2 biphenyloxy l aminohexane hydrochloride suspended in 50 ml of ether is stirred with a twofold stoichiometric excess of dilute aqueous potassium carbonate solution until the salt is completely dissolved. The organic layer is then separated, washed twice with water, dried over magnesium sulfate and evaporated to yield 6 2 biphenyloxy l aminohexane as the free base. EXAMPLE 8 Conversion of Salt to Free Base 1.0 g of 4 4 biphenyloxy l aminobutane hydrochloride suspended in 50 ml of ether is stirred with a twofold stoichiometric excess of dilute aqueous potassium carbonate solution until the salt is completely dissolved. The organic layer is then separated, washed twice with water, dried over magnesium sulfate and evaporated to yield 4 4 biphenyloxy l aminobutane as the free base. EXAMPLE 9 Direct interchange of acid addition salts 6 2 biphenyloxy l dimethylaminohexane acetate 1.0 g is dissolved in 50 ml water containing a stoichiometric equivalent of sulfuric acid, and the solution evaporated to dryness. The product is suspended in ethanol and filtered, air dried and recrystallized from methanol acetone to yield 6 2 biphenyfoxy l dimethylaminohexane bisulfate. EXAMPLE 10 Direct interchange of acid addition salts 7 4 biphenyloxy l dimethylaminoheptane acetate 1.0 g is dissolved in 50 ml water containing a stoichiometric equivalent of sulfuric acid, and the solution evaporated to dryness. The product is suspended ln ethanol and filtered, air dried and recrystallized from methanol acetone to yield 7 4 biphenyloxy l dimethylaminoheptane bisulfate. In a similar manner interchanges between other acid addition salts of compounds of Formula I can be made by treating with an appropriate inorganic or organic acid.

EXAMPLE 17 Determination of Anti Inflammatory Activity Utilizing Adjuvant Induced Arthritis In The RatProtocol This procedure is a modification of a system initially described by Pearson, C.M., Proc.Soc.Exp.Biol.Med., 91 95 101 1956 . Female Sprague Dawley albino rats weighing 160 180 g received 0.1 ml of a suspension in paraffin oil of heat killed M. butyricum 10 mg ml by means of an intradermal injection into the proximal 1 4 of the tail on day 0. Beginning on day 0, the test material was administered orally in an aqueous vehicle 0.5 ml dose twice each day for 17 days such that animals received 50 mg Kg day of the test material. On day 18, the animals were sacrificed, and the hind paws were removed an weighed. Hind paws weights of animals receiving the test material were composed with those of animal receiving the aqueous vehicle alone positive control , and those of normal animals negative control which did not receive an injection of adjuvant. The results are expressed as percent inhibition of the increase in hind paw weights of the positive control group over the negative control group. The following table shows the percent inhibition achieved by each compound tested Compound Inhibition 6 4 biphenyloxy l aminohexane 43 5 7 4 biphenyloxy 1 33 4 dimethylaminoheptane 8 4 biphenyloxy l 38 3 dimethylaminoocatane 9 4 biphenyloxy l 32 2 dimethylaminononane 6 3 biphenyloxy 1 33 aminohexane 8 3 biphenyloxy l 32 aminooctane 8 3 biphenyloxy l 23 dimethylaminooctane 6 4 methoxy 4 biphenyloxy l 25 2 aminohexane 6 4 methoxy 4 biphenyloxy 1 42 dimethylaminohexane 6 2,6 dimethyl 4 biphenyloxy l 21 4 dimethylaminohexane 8 2,6 dimethyl 4 biphenyloxy l 40 2 dimethylaminooctane number in parenthesis indicates number of assays which were performed if greater than one. EXAMPLE 18 Determination Of Anti Inflammatory Activity Using The Croton Oil Inflamed Rat EarProtocol A modification of the method of Tonelli et al,Endocrinology, 77 625 634 1965 . Intact male Simonsen albino rats, 21 days old, were anesthetized with ether and the test material was inuncted onto the left ear as follows 0.05 ml of the vehicle containing the compound in solution was applied to the inner surface of the ear and 0.05 ml of the vehicle was applied to the outer surface. The vehicle consisted of 20 pyridine, 5 distilled water, 74 diethyl ether and 1 croton oil. The rats of the control group received only the vehicle, which served as the inflammatory stimulus. Since the inflammatory agent and test material were given together, the test measures the ability of the test agent to prevent the development of the inflammation, not the ability of the agent to inhibit a pre induced inflammation. Both ears were removed 6 hr after the agent was applied and a piece of uniform size was punched from each ear with a No. 4 cork bore. The results are expressed as percent inhibition of the difference between the weight of the piece punched from the left inflamed ear and that of the right non inflamed control ear. The following table shows the percent inhibition achieved by each compound tested Compound Inhibition 8 2 biphenyloxy l aminooctane 35 6 2 biphenyloxy l dimethylaminohexane 33 EXAMPLE 19 Determination Of Anti Psoriatic Activity The anti psoriatic activity was determined according to the method as described by K. J. Dumas et al in ActaDermatovener Stockholm , 55 43 48 1972 . The test results showed that 2 biphenyloxy 6 dimethylaminohexane cleared the psoriatic lesions in 60 of the cases tested. EXAMPLE 20 Determination Of Toxicity of The Compounds of The Present Invention a In toxicological studies, the following compounds 8 4 biphenyloxy 1 dimethylaminooctane 6 4 biphenyloxy 1 aminshexane 7 4 biphenyloxy l dimethylaminoheptane and 6 2,6 dimethyl 4 biphenyloxy 1 dimethylaminohexane, were separately administered to groups of 10 rats 5 male, 5 female at a total daily oral dose of 50 mg Kg rat in two equal daily doses for 14 days. No deaths were observed, from which it can be concluded that the oral LD50 of the compounds in rat is considerably greater than 50 mg Kg. b In toxicological studies, the following compounds 6 2 biphenyloxy l dimethylaminohexane and 6 4 biphenyloxy l aminohexane, were administered to groups of 10 mice at a total dose of 10 mg Kg mouse day by intraperitoneal injection. No deaths were observed. It can therefore be concluded that the intraperitoneal LD50 of these compounds in the mouse is considerably greater than lOmg Kg.
