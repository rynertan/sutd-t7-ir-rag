# Wheelbarrow.

## Abstract
In a wheelbarrow having a bin 1 for the load, a ground wheel 2 at a front end of the bin and a handle 3 at a rear end, the handle 3 has a cam shaped extension 7 which forms a leg for the bin rear end and which is mounted on a pivot 4 carried on the bin. The handle 3 can be released from its normal position and then pivoted forward in the direction of the wheel 2, this action causes rotation of the cam and the bin rear end is lowered to near ground level to allow easy loading of the bin. When loaded the handle 3 can be returned to its position at the bin rear end and the cam simultaneously lifts the bin and load. The load may then be carried and emptied as with a conventional wheelbarrow.
