# LOW MASS CONFORMABLE HEAT AND PRESSURE FUSER

## Abstract
Heat and pressure fusing apparatus having a thin walled tubular fuser roll 74 cooperating with a rigid pressure roll 86 to pass copy substrates therebetween with the toner images on the substrates contacting said fuser roll. The rolls are supported in pressure engagement such that their axes are skewed relative to each other to compensate for roll deflection aggravated by hoop deflection of the thin walled fuser roll. Thernal degradation of the elastomeric conform able coating is reduced by standing by at a low temperature and quickly warming up to run temperature.
