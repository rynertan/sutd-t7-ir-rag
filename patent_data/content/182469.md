# Apparatus and method for obtaining surface profilometry and three dimensional surface contours.

## Abstract
Phase measurements of deformed grating images are used in performing improved optical profilometry. In one embodiment, an incident beam of light having a sinusoidally varying intensity pattern is directed 110 at the object 150 and the phase of the sinusoidal intensity pattern of the incident beam is modulated. A deformed grating image of the object for a number of different modulated phases of the incident beam is received at a detector 120 . Then, for points on the surface of the object, the height at each point is determined with respect to a reference plane, each height determination including the step of combining the image intensity values at a detector position corresponding to a respec tive point of the object. In another embodiment, line profiles are obtained at a series of rotational increments of a body. A full 360 degree surface profile, or a portion thereof, can then be gener ated.
