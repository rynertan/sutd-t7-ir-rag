# Friction clutches.

## Abstract
A friction clutch comprises a driving member 13 incor porating first and second cover members 14 15 joined together and forming an enclosure therebetween. Within the enclosure are a first driven plate 27 , an intermediate pres sure plate 34 , a second driven plate 35 and a main pres sure plate 41 . In the engaged condition these components are all clamped together by a belville spring 43 . A release rod 47 acts on pressure plate 41 to move it against spring 43 and release the clutch. Pressure plate 41 is driven by straps not shown from cover member 15 while intermediate pressure plate 34 is similarly driven by straps from cover member 14 . This arrangement allows the clutch to be handled in two major sub assemblies. The first of these includes cover member 15 , spring 43 and pressure plate 41 . The second incorporates intermediate pressure plate 34 and cover member 14 . Driven plate 27 has to be positioned between cover member 14 and intermediate pressure plate 34 prior to assembly of these components. The nature of these sub assemblies simplifies handling and assembly of the clutch into a vehicle.
