# Arrangement for a surveillance apparatus.

## Abstract
An arrangement for a vehicle or vessel borne surveil lance apparatus is provided with a two axis, vehicle or vessel borne gimbal system 2, 3 and a platform 4 suspended by said gimbal system 2, 3 . The platform 4 can be stabilised about the orthogonal axes AA , BB of the gimbal system 2,3 with respect to an earth fixed reference position. The surveillance apparatus 5 is mounted rotatably about an axis 6 perpendicular to the platform 4 . The arrangement comprises two linear actuators 7 , being mounted directly on the vehicle or vessel, but acting on the platform 4 , to permit the above platform stabilisation through a mutually equidirectional or opposite motion. The arrangement further comprises a mechanical, universal coupling to transmit the rotational motion produced by a drive mechanism 8 , being mounted directly on the vehicle or vessel, to the surveillance apparatus 5 .
