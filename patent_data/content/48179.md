## Abstract
In a binary fluid power plant in which the bottom fluid is steam water and the evaporator 22 for the water is arranged in the condensing system for the top fluid , the said evaporator is heated by top fluid condensate but only after the said condensate has been cooled by steam heating means 23, 25 , and the top fluid condensate, after leaving the said evaporator 22 in cooled condition, is caused to effect the condensation of the second fluid vapour, for example, by the spraying of it into the vapour space of the top fluid condenser 10 . The system has been designed primarily for a nuclear reactor power plant 1 operating with the transfer of core heating indirectly to vaporize potassium as the top fluid of the binary fluid power plant.
