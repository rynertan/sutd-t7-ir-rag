## Description
This invention relates to a novel process for producing N,N disubstituted carboxylic acid amides of the following formula I EMI1.1 wherein R, R11 R2 and R3 are defined below. Processes for producing N,N disubstituted carboxylic acid amides of formula I which are useful, for example, as medicines, agricultural chemicals, or starting materials or intermediates for producing them are generally known lsee, for example, Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication No. 4181 1985 laid open on January 10, 1985 U. S.Patents Nods. 2863752, 4372972, 4282028, 4460603, 4521243, 4494978, 4155744, 4456471, 3586496 and 3367847 R. B.Wagner, H. D. Zook, Synthetic Organic Chemistry , p. 565 1953 , John Wiley Sons, Inc. and A. Venkov, M. Nikolova,N. Mollov, Chem. Ind. London , p. 808 1982 1. The most general industrial process among them comprises reducing a Schiff base of the following formula 11 EMI1.2 wherein R, R1 and R2 are as defined below, and acylating or aroylating the resulting reduction product to form a compound of formula I . For example, the above citedJapanese Laid Open Patent Publication No. 4181 1985 discloses a process for producing N,N disubstituted carboxylic acid amides by a step of reducing the starting Schiff base and a step of chloroacetylating the resulting reduction product in accordance with the following scheme.EMI2.1 In the above scheme, A represents a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, an alkyl group, an alkoxy group or an alkylthio group, and R1, R2 and R3, independently from each other, represent a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, an alkyl group, an alkoxy group or an alkylthio group. Known processes for producing N,N disubstituted carboxylic acid amides including the above exemplified process have one or more defects. For example, they have complex manufacturing steps. The compounds used as starting materials or intermediates are difficult to cbtain, or are unstable. Furthermore, the yields of the desired compounds are low. These defects make it difficult for the known processes to give the desired compounds in goods yields at low cost by simple manufacturing steps. The present inventors have extensively worked on an improvement in conventional industrial processes for producing N,N disubstituted carboxylic acid amides which essentially comprise the above two steps, and consequently found that by contacting a Schiff base with a carboxylic acid derivative in the presence of a silane compound, the desired N,N disubstituted carboxylic acid amide can be produced easily in good yields by a one step process. The investigations of the present inventors have shown that this novel mode of reaction can be applied to the reaction of a wide range of Schiff bases with a wide range of carboxylic acid derivatives. According to this invention, there is provided a novel process for producing N,N disubstituted carboxylic acid amides represented by the following formula I EMI3.1 wherein R represents a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group, an alkenyl group, an alkoxy group, an alkenyloxy group, a substituted carbonyl group or a trihalogenomethyl group R1, R2 and R3, in dependently from each other, represent a sub stituted or unsubstituted alkyl group, a sub stituted or unsubstituted alkenyl group, a sub stituted or unsubstituted alkynyl group, a sub stituted or unsubstituted aryl group, a substi tuted or unsubstituted heteroaryl group, a sub stituted or unsubstituted cycloalkyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkenyl group or a substituted or unsubstituted heterocyclo alkyl group R1 may further represent a hydrogen atom and R and R1, taken together, may form a substituted or unsubstituted cyclic group to gether with the carbon atom to which they are bonded, which comprises contacting a Schiff base represented by the following formula II EMI3.2 wherein R, R1 and R2 are as defined above, with a carboxylic acid derivative represented by the following formula III EMI4.1 wherein R3 is as defined above, and M represents a halogen atom or the moietyEMI4.2 in the presence of a silane compound represented by the following formula IV EMI4.3 wherein X, Y and Z, independently from each other, represent a hydrogen atom or a halogen atom, in the presence or absence of an inert organic solvent. The novel process of this invention can be shown, for example, by the following reaction scheme.EMI4.4 The mechanism of the reaction by which the desired compound of formula I is formed in one step by the above novel process is not entirely clear. One possible mechanism presumed by the present inventors is that theSchiff base II and the carboxylic acid derivaive III react in the presence of the silane compound IV to form an immonium salt type compound EMI5.1 or its M adductEMI5.2 as an intermediate which further reacts with the silane compound IV to form the desired amide compound. Another possible mechanism is that the Schiff base II first reacts with the silane compound IV to form an N silyl compoundEMI5.3 after which its acylation or arocylation takes place to form the desired amide compound. It should be understood that the above reaction mechanisms are merely presumed, and do not in any way limit the novel process of this invention, and that the process of this invention includes all embodiments in which the desired compound of formula I is formed in one step by contacting of the compound of formula II with the compound of formula III in the presence of the compound IV which results in the reaction of these three components. It has thus been found in accordance with this invention that by the novel mode of reaction, the compound of formula I can be produced easily in good yields at low cost with industrial advantage from the compound of formula II in one step.

In the practice of the process of this invention, the reaction may be carried out in the presence or absence of a solvent. Generally, it is preferred to carry it out in an inert organic solvent which does not react with the reactants and the products. Examples of the inert organic solvent include hydrocarbons, halogenated hydrocarbons, and nitriles, such as benzene, toluene, methylene dichloride, chloroform and acetonitrile. The amounts of the compounds of formulae Il , III and IV charged in the practice of the process of this invention can be properly selected.

This amount may be varied properly depending upon the number of hydrogen atoms which the silane compound of formula IV has. For example, when the silane compound of formula IV has one hydrogen atom, its amount is 1 to 2.2 moles.

The amounts of the compounds of formulae it , III , and IV can be easily set at preferred values by preliminary experiments according to the types of these compounds, the reaction conditions, etc. If the carboxylic acid derivative of formula III is used in too large an amount, side reactions sometimes tend to occur. Accordingly, it is preferred to determine the mole ratio of the starting materials experimentally before they are actually used in the process. The Schiff base of formula II , as one starting material used in the invention, needs not to be a purified one. For example, it is possible to synthesize a Schiff base from an aldehyde and an amine by azeotropic dehydration, etc., and the as synthesized Schiff base can be reacted directly with the silane compound IV and the carboxylic acid derivative III . The reaction temperature is not particularly limited, and can be selected from a broad range of temperatures. Preferably, the reaction is carried out at temperatures which are suitable in view of the chemical reactivity of the starting compounds or the stability of the resulting amide compound. Generally, it is selected from a range of 200C to 150 0C. The reaction time, which varies depending upon the reaction temperature, may generally be several minutes to several days, for example 5 minutes to 10 days. The sequence of addition of the reactants of formulae 11 , III and IV in the process of this invention is not particularly limited. Generally, the silane compound and the carboxylic acid derivative are added to the Schiff base at room temperature or under cooling. It is also possible to add the Schiff base to a solution of the silane compound and the carboxylic acid derivative. In general, a solvent is frequently used in this reaction. For example, it is possible to add theSchiff base, the silane compound and the carboxylic acid derivative to a solvent, and then react the three compounds in it. Alternatively, the three compounds are dissolved in separate solvents and the solutions are mixed for reaction. According to this invention, the carboxylic acid amides of formula I can be easily obtained by reacting the starting compounds of formulae it , III and IV .There is no particular limitation on the method of purifying the compound of formula I obtained by the above reaction. Generally, after the reaction, the reaction mixture may be distilled under atmospheric or reduced pressure. As required, washing, recrystallization and chromatography may also be used for purification. When the compound I obtained has a high boiling point, lowboiling components such as the solvent are removed, and the residue is again dissolved in a solvent. The solution is washed with water and a dilute aqueous alkaline solution, and then the solvent is removed. As a result, the unreacted silane compound and carboxylic acid derivative, a by product silane compound, etc. can be easily removed, and the desired compound of formula I can be obtained in pure form. Specific examples of especially useful N,N disubstituted carboxylic acid amides of formula I obtained by the process of this invention are given below. In the following compounds, Et represents an ethyl group. EMI22.1 EMI23.1 EMI24.1 EMI25.1 EMI26.1 EMI27.1 The N,N disubstituted carboxylic acid amides obtained by the process of this invention are known to be useful as medicines and agricultural chemicaas such as herbicides, insecticides or fungicides and intermediates for the production of the medicines and the agricultural chemicals. Accordingly, they can be used in these known applications without any restriction. The process of this invention is an excellent process for producing N,N disubstituted carboxylic acid amides useful as medicines and agricultural chemicals in good yields from the corresponding Schiff base compounds in one step under mild reaction conditions. After the reaction, the resulting product can be easily purified. Accordingly, the present invention offers an excellent industrial advantage. The following Examples illustrate the present invention more specifically. It should be understood that the invention is in no way limited by these examples. EXAMPLE 1 A three necked flask was charged with a solution of 2 3 methoxy thienylmethylidene 2 ,6 dimethylaniline 2.49 g in dry benzene 15 ml , and under a nitrogen atmosphere, a solution of trichlorosilane 2.48 g in dry benzene 5 ml was gradually added dropwise with stirring at room temperature. Thereafter, a solution of chloroacetyl chloride 1.22 g in dry benzene 5 ml was gradually added, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2 hours. Low boiling components were removed, and the remaining viscous liquid was again dissolved in benzene 50 ml . The benzene solution was washed with water and then with a dilute aqueous alkaline solution, and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. Benzene was removed, and the resulting viscous liquid was dried under vacuum to give a pale brown solid 3.30 g .When distilled, this compound had a boiling point of 172OC 0.15 mmHg. The infrared absorption spectrum of this compound showed an absorption at 3100 2800 cm assigned to theC H bond, and a strong absorption at 1670 cm 1 assigned to the carbonyl linkage of the amide group. Elemental analysis values were C 59.37 , H 5.89 , and N 4.05 , which well agreed with the calculated values for the composition formula C16Hl8NSO2Cl 323.84 , i.e.C 59.33 , H 5.61 and N 4.33 . The mass spectrum of the compound showed a molecular ion peak, , corresponding to the molecular weight at m e 323, a peak corresponding to M C1 at m e 288, a peak corresponding to COCH2C1 at m e 246, and a peak corresponding toEMI29.1 at m e 127 100 . The 1H NMR spectrum 6 ppm internal standard tetramethylsilane deuterochloroform solvent of the compound was also measured. The results were as follows EMI29.2 It shows a singlet at 1.95 ppm for 6 protons corresponding to the methyl protons of f substituted at the 2 and 6 positions of the phenyl group a singlet at 3.50 ppm for 3 protons corresponding to the methyl group of a a singlet at 3.72 ppm for 2 protons corresponding to the methylene group of e a singlet at 4.75 ppm for 2 protons corresponding to the methylene group of d a quadruplet at 6.55 ppm for 2 protons corresponding to the protons of the thiophene ring of b and e and a multiplet at 7.00 7.45 ppm for 3 group corresponding to the protons of the benzene ring at g , h and i . The above results led to the determination that the isolated product was N 12 3 methoxy thienylmethyl N chloroaceto 2,6 dimethylanilide. The yield was 93 . EXAMPLE 2 The same reaction as in Example 1 was carried out by using acetonitrile as the solvent. After the reaction, low boiling components were removed, and the resulting viscous liquid was dried in vacuum to form a solid. Recrystallization of the solid from hexane gave N 12 3 methoxy thienylmethyl N chloroaceto 2,6 dimethylanilide as white crystals in a yield of 55 . EXAMPLE 3 A solution of 2 N methylpyrrolyl methylidene 2 ,6 diethylaniline 2.40 g in dry benzene 20 ml was put in a flask. Under a nitrogen atmosphere, a solution of chloroacetyl chloride 1.42 g in dry benzene 5 ml was gradually added with stirring at room temperature. Thereafter, a solution of trichlorosilane 2.38 g in dry benzene 10 ml was added. After the addition, the mixture was heated with stirring for 1 hour over an oil bath 50 0C . Low boiling components were removed under reduced pressure, and the resulting viscous liquid was purified by column chromatography to give N 2 N methylpyrrolyl methyl N chloroaceto 2 ,6 diethylanilide of the following formula as a pale brown solid in a yield of 648. EMI30.1 EXAMPLE 4 A mixture of n hexylaldehyde 1.53 g , 2,6 diethylaniline 2.24 g and benzene 50 ml was heated under reflux for 1 hour over an oil bath to perform azeotropic dehydration. To the resulting solution were added a solution of chloroacetyl chloride 1.79 g in dry benzene 5 ml and then a solution of trichlorosilane 3.40 g in dry benzene 5 ml with stirring at room temperature.After the addition, the mixture was heated with stirring for 2 hours over an oil bath 400C . Low boiling components were removed under reduced pressure, and the resulting viscous liquid was dissolved in ether 50 ml . The ether solution was washed with water, and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. Ether was removed, and the resulting liquid was distilled to form N n hexyl N chloroaceto 2,6 diethylanilide of the following formula having a boiling point of 1520C 0.2 mmHg in a yield of 55 based on 2,6 diethylaniline.EMI31.1 EXAMPLE 5 In the same way as in Examples 1, 2 and 3, various amide compounds were synthesized using trichlorosilane as the silane compound.
