## Description
MODIFIED EPOXY RESIN COMPOSITION AND PROCESS FOR ThE PREPARATION ThEREOF The present invention relates to a modified epoxy resin composition and to a process for modifying an epoxy resin in order to provide it with other properties without making the original properties thereof. Epoxy resins usually have excellent properties, such as excellent mechanical strength, adhesion, heat resistance and chemical resistance, and hence, they are widely usec for making coating compositions, electrical insulators, materials for civil engineering and construction, adhesives and composite materials, owever, the cured epoxy resin products usually possess and inferior flexibility, and hence, attempts have been made to improve the fragility thereof and to give them excellent impact resistance and thermal shock resistance.For example, it has been proposed to modify the epoxy resin by adding thereto a modifying agent such as a polysulfide, polychloroprene, polybutadiene, dimeric acid, polyester ether or polyamide, but such methods have some disadvantages that result i.a a deterioration of the original properties of epoxy resin such as mechanical strength, electric properties, heat resistance, solvent resistance, corrosion resistance, and furthermore that the most suitable method must be individually selected in accordance with the intended utilities. When employing the resin for making coating compositions,the epoxy resin should have impact resistance and an adhesion to the substrate as well as solvent resistance, and corrosion resistance.Furthermore, other properties are reqL ea such as crpatibility of the epoxy resin with the modifying agent, homogeneity, film forming properties of the vehicle resin and crosslinking curing properties.Such requirements have never been satisfied by the known techniques. Recently, epoxy resins have been used as materials for cathode electrocoating compositon suitable for coating automobiles, and for this use various methods have been proposed forimproving the properties of the epoxy resins, in order to give coating compositions having excellent chip resistance, corrosion resistance, etc.,Among these, it has been proposed to use as a flexibilizer a liquid polybutadiene which has been used for the preparation of anode electrocoating compositions. However, the liquid polybutadiene has an insufficient carpatibility with the epoxy resin, and even if it is chemically bonded to the epoxy resin by means of an appropriate reactive group, it is still difficult to obtain a good composition which can give a clear uniform coating layer.In order to eliminate such a drawback, particularly to improve the compatibility of the flexibilizer with the epoxy resin, various methods have been proposed. For example, it is disclosed in Japanese PatentPublication unexamined No. 97632 1979 that a base resin for a cationic electrocoating composition is obtained by reacting a butadiene acrylonitrile copolymer containing carboxyl groups at both ends thereof with an epoxy resin. According to this method, the compatibility with the epoxy resin is much improved owing to the acrylonitrile group, but it still has insufficient film forming properties and flexibility. Moreover, since this copolymer is a comparatively high molecular weight functional polymer, use thereof is restricted.For example, it is ec essary to spedify the ratio of the copolymer to the epoxy resin in orderto give the desired homogeneity of the electrocoating composition or to regulate the concentration of a cationic group in order to give the desired electrophoresis. This method is also disadvantageous in view of the high cost. Another approach for improving the flexibility by using a liquid polybutadiene is disclosed in Japanese PatentPublication unexamined No. 5933 1980, wherein a reaction product of an epoxy resin with a conjugated diene polymer containing a carboxyl group at the end or intermediate of the molecule is used as a base resin for a cat ionic electrocoating composition. The liquid polybutadiene used in this method is substantially a liquid polybutadiene having a high 1,2 vinyl structure and having carboxyl groups at both ends thereof,and the liquid polybutadiene is used for improving smoothness and curing properties of the coating film. These liquid polyubutadienes having a high l,2 vinyjL structure or consisting mainly of butadiene skeleton are still inferior liy their cor,patibility with the epoxy resins. Another method is proposed in Japanese PatentPublication unexamined No. 5932 1980 which discloses a resin composition suitable for a cathode precipitating type electrocoating which comprises predominantly a reaction product of a basic resin and an amine modified epoxy resin, wherein the basic resin is obtained by reacting an anhydrous maleic acid adduct of a liquid polybutadiene or a natural drying oil with a diamine containing a tertiary amino group within the molecule e.g. N,N dimethylaminopropanediamine and an aminoalcohol e.g. monoethanolamine or a diamine containing a hydroxy group e.g. 2 N,N dihydroxymethylaino ethyl amine , by which the liquid polybutadiene or natural drying 7 oil is bonded to a tertiary amino group and hydroxy group via an imidohydrocarbon bond.Since the basic resin used in this method contains a large amount of an aliphatic tertiary amino group having a comparatively strong basicity and having, a polymerization catalyst activity to the epoxy group, when the basic resin is reacted with the epoxy resin in a system containing an excess amount of epoxy groups, a polymerization reaction due to ring openino of the epoxy groups occurs andlthe esterificatian reaction betten the o b l group of the basic resin and the epoxy group of the epoxy resin proceeds insufficiently,which unfavorably results in gelation of the system.Accordingly, in the method of Japanese PatentPublication unexained No.5932 1980,the dilation of then epoxy resin is carried out while preventing the above mentioned undesirable side reaction by carrying out the reaction in the presence of an equimolar amount of an amine to the excess epoxy groups, or by charging the basic resin into the system after a part of the amination reaction has taken place. It has been required to give a flexibility to the epocy resins not only in the field of cationic electrocoating but also in other coating fields and in the production of carious molding compositions. We have now developed an improved modified epoxy resin which can give a cured product having excellent clexibility and which has an excellent compatibility with other epoxy resins and an improved process for modifying epoxy resins in order to give them various properties without making the original properties thereof inferior.advantages of the present invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the following description. Acoordingly,the improved epoxy resin of the present invention is obtained by treating an epoxy resin with at least one modified adduct D of a conjugated diene polymer or copolymer which has an imido bond and or amido bond and a semiester structure and has an acid value owing to a free carboxyl group of 5 to 100, preferably 10 to 50, the modified adduct being obtained by reacting an adduct 1A of a polymer of a conjugated diene having a number average molecular weight of 300 to 20,000, preferably 500 to 5,000, or a copolymer of the conjugated diene and e vinyl monomer with an a,ss unsaturated dicarboxylic acid or its anhydride, with a compound 3 containing one primary amino group in the molecule and a compound C containing a hydroxy group in the molecule. The modified epoxy resin of the present invention is characteristic in that it has a good compatibility with conventional epoxy resins, such as epi bis type epoxy resins derived from bisphenol A and epichlorohydrin, polyglycidyl ether type epoxy resins derived from a novalac resin, polyglycidyl amine type epoxy resins derived from an aromatic amine, and polyglycidyl ester type epoxy resins derived from an aromatic polycarboxylic acid, and that when it is usea in coati ng compositions and molding compositions, it can give cured products having excellent flexibility, such as excellent impact resistance and thermal shock resistance. The present invention is also characteristic in that the most suitable micro structure or molecular weight of the conjugated diene polymer or copolymer can freely be selected in accordance with the requirements and utilities of the final products. For example,, when a liquid polybutadiene being rich in cis 1,4 bonds is used.as the base of the modified adduct, a comparatively small amount of the modified adduct can give the desired flexibility to the epoxy resin. When an adduct having a high 1,2 vinyl structure is used,a haracomposition can be obtained.Furthermore, by controlling the amount of the a,ss unsaturated dicarboxylic acid or its anhydride e.g. maleic anhydride introduced into the liquid polybutadiene, or by controlling the modifying conditions, the dicarboxylic acid or its anhydride can react with the liquid polybutadiene in an amount equimolar or nearly equimolar to the epoxy resin as calculated as a monomer . The conjugated diene polymer used in the present invention has a number average of from O0 to 20,000, preferably 500 to 5,000. The conjugated diene polymer includes homopolymers of a conjugated diene monomer and also copolymers thereof with other copolymerizable monomers. The micro structure of the double bond thereof is not important, but the polymer contain an optional ratio of 1,4 bonds, 1,2 bonds or 3,4 bonds. Suitable examples of the conjugated diene monomer are butadiene, isoprene, chloropreneanS l,3 Fentodrene. Suitable examples of other copolymerizable monomers are vinyl monomers such as acrylic acid esters e.g. methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, etc. , methacrylic acid esters e.g. methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, etc. , acrylonitrile, styrene, acetylene, ethylene o5 propylene which may be used alone or in combination of two or more thereof. The conjugated diene copolymer preferably contains 50 by mole or more of the conjugated diene monomer, preferably butadiene or isoprene. The conjugated diene polymer and copolymer may also contain carboxyl and or hydroxy groups. The a,8 unsaturated dicarboxylic acid or its anhydride includes maleic anhydride, maleic acid, fumaric acid, itaconic acid and citraconic acid, am9ngst which maleic anhydride is particularly suitable. In accordance with variations of the micro structure and molecular weights of the conjugated diene polymer or copolymer, the types of the copolymerizable monomers and also the desired utilities of the final products, the most suitable amount of the a,ss unsaturated dicarboxylic acid or its anhydride and also the most suitable type and amount of the compounds B and C are carefully selected. The compound B containing one primary amino group in the molecule includes a compound containing a primary amino group and an aromatic residue in the molecule which has the following formula EMI9.1 wherein R1 and R2 are the same or different and are each hydrogen, an alkyl group having 1 to 5 carbon arans, halogen, cyano, hydroxy, thiol, methoxy, CONH2, COCH3, COOCH3, or N CH3 2, and n is or an integer. of from 1 to 3, and a compound containing a primary amino group and an aliphatic or alicyclic hydrocarbon group in the molecule which has the following formula R3 NH2 11 wherein R3 is an aliphatic hydrocarbon group having 1 to 18 carbon atoms or an alicyclic hydrocarbon group having 3 to 18 carbon atoms, the aliphatic and alicyclic hydrocarbon groups containing optionally an ether bond.

These compounds may be used alone or as a mixture of two or more thereof. The amount of a, unsaturated dicarboxylic acid or its anhydride may vary depending on the molecular weight of the conjugated diene polymer or copolymer to be reacted, but is usually in an an ont Buch that the content of the a,ss unsaturated dicarboxylic acid or its anhydride in the adduct A becomes 5 to 50 by weight, preferably 5 to 30 by weight.When the content of a,ss dicarboxylic acid or its anhydride in the adduct A is lower than 5 by weight, the modified epoxy resin obtained shows an inferior compatibility with other epoxy resins, and on the other hand, when the content is over 50 by weight, the modification reaction can hardly be carried out because of the increased viscosity of the reaction system. The adduct A of the conjugated diene polymer or copolymer,with the a,ss dicarboxylic acid or its anhydride can be prepared by any conventional method, for example, by mixing a conjugated diene polymer or copolymer and an a,6 icarboxylic acid or its anhydride e.g. maleic anhydride and reacting them under an inert gas at a temperature of 50 to 3000C, preferably 150 to 2100C, for 30 minutes to 10 hours, preferably 2 to 6 hours. In this reaction, an antigelling agent may optionally be added in an amount of 0.01 to 5 by weight, and further an inert organic solvent may be used. The modified adduct D can be prepared by. reacting the adduct A1 with an amino compound B of the formula I or II and a compound C containing a hydroxy group, wherein the compound B3 and the compound C are used in an amount of 5 to 95 z by mole and 95 to 5 by mole, respectively, to 1 mole of the a,ss dicarboxylic acid or its anhydride e.g. maleic anhydride bonded to the conjugated diene polymer or copolymer. In this reaction, the compound B is reacted with the acid or its anhydride group contained in the adduct A and is almost all formed into imido. bond but it ray optionally reformed into an amido bondcarboxylic acid skeleton. Besides, the compound 1C is formed into an ester bond carboxylic acid skeleton. The modified adduct Djpreferably contains at least 0.5 equivalent weight, preferably 0.75 equivalent weight or more, of a free carboxyl group as calculated as COOH number per one molecule of the conjugated diene polymer or copolymer as calculated based on the average malecular weight . In this respect, the suitable amounts of the compound B and compound C are also determined. The reaction of the adduct A with the compounds 1B and C may be carried out simultaneously in the same reaction system or in sequence, that is, by reacting firstly the adduct A with the compound B or 1C preferably compound C and adding the compound C1 or B preferably compound B to the reaction system preferably after partially carrying out the above reaction, and then cctpletin the reaction of the adduct A and the compounds B and C . Thus, the reaction of the adduct A with the compounds B and C includes the following features. 1 The adduct A is mixed with the compound B and the compound C and the mixture is simultaneously subjected to the reaction. 2 The adduct A is firstly, preferably partially, reacted with the compound C , and subsequently the compound B is reacted with the resulting reaction mixture. 3 The adduct A is reacted with the compounds B and C while adding dropwise a mixture of the compounds tB and C to the reaction system. 4 The adduct tA is firstly, preferably partially, reacted with the compound B , and subsequently the compound C is reacted with the resulting reaction mixture. When the adduct A is firstly reacted with an equimolar or excess amound of the compound C , whole or most acid anhydride groups contained in the adduct A are ring opened to give a partially esterified product, and then, the extra partial ester bonds may be converted into imido bonds by reacting the product with the compound B of a predetermined amount. In this case, the suitable amount of the compound B is determined so that the ratio of the substituents in the final product is within a suitable ranger By the reaction of the adduct A and the compound C , a partially esterified product is obtained.This reaction can be carried out by any conventional method, for example, by reacting the adduct A with the compound C at a temperature of 30 to 2000C, preferably 30 to 1600C, for 30 minutes to 5 hours, usually in the presence of a slight amount of a catalyst selected from quaternary ammonium salts, tertiary amines, alkali metal salts, or organic acids, wherein an inert solvent such as toluene, xylene, methyl isobutyl ketone or ethylene glycol ethyl ether monoacetate may optionally be used. The reaction of the adduct A and the compound CB may also be carried out by any conventional r ethod, for example, by reacting the adduct A or the partial reaction product of the adduct A and the compound C with the compound B at a temperature of 30 to 2500C, preferably 30 to 2000C,whilst removing th by produced water. Since this reaction is occasionally accompanied with an exotherm or foaming, the compound B is addled portion wise to the reaction system, or an appropriate inert solvent as mentioned above is used. In order to obtain partially amidated products, it is preferable to carry out the reaction at a temperature not higher than 1O00C. The finishing point of the above mentioned reactions may be determined by gas chromatography, IR spectrum, or based upon the amount of the by produced water, but it is usually easily determined by measuring an acid value, amine value or saponification value of the reaction system. Modification of an epoxy resin with the modified adduct D thus obtained is carried out by mixing an epoxy resin containing at least one epoxy group, preferably two or more epoxy groups with the modified adduct fD and reacting the mixture under an inert gas at a temperature of 50 to 2500C, preferably 80 to 2000C, for 30 minutes to 10 hours, wherein appropriate catalyst and solvent as mentioned above may optionally be used. The reaction is usually carried out while checking the acid value of the system in order to determine the finishing point. The amount of the modified adduct D may vary with the requirements and utilities of the final modified epoxy resins, but is usually in the range of 5 to 300 parts by weight, preferably 10 to 100 parts by weight, to 100 parts by weight of the epoxy resin. The modified epoxy resin obtained by the present invention contains an epoxy group in the molecule, and hence, can be used like the conventional unmodified epoxy resins and can give a cured product having excellent flexibility and thermal shock resistance whilst maintaining excellent mechanical strength, adhesion, heat resistance, and chemical resistance. Thus, the modified epoxy resin of the present invention can be formed into resin for cationic electrocoating composition having excellent chip resistance and corrosion resistance by aminating the remaining epoxy groups of the modified epoxy resin and also using isocyanate compounds.Furtherirore, the itolified epoxy resin of the present invention can be used for the preparation of various coating compositions by incor poraing it with a suitable curing agent. Moreover, a liquid resin obtained by modifying an epoxy resin having a low molecular weight by the present invention is suitable as a cast resin having an excellent thermal shock resistance. The present invention is illustrated by the following Examples, but is not limited thereto. Example 1 A liquid polybutadiene number average molecular weight 1680, viscosity at 200C 650 cp, iodine value ijs method 445, cis 1,4 structure 76 , trans 1,4 structure 23 ,and 1,2 vinyl structure 1 340 g , maleic anhydride 60 g and iron naphthenate Fe 5.0 0.68 g are charged into a 500 ml four necked flask, and the mixture is reacted under nitrogen gas at 1900C for 4 hours to give a maleinated polybutadiene total acid value 162 . Into a 500 ml four necked flask are charged the maleinated polybutadiene obtained above 200 g , toluene 54,0 g , 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate 13.0 g , phenothiazine 0.8 g and benzyltrimethylammonium chloride 30 mg , and the mixture is reacted at 90 C for 2 hours.The flask is equipped with a condenser for taking out the by produced water and a dropping funnel, and thereto is added dropwise a mixture of aniline 18.6 g , phenothiazine 0.5 g and toluene 44 g through the dropping funnel. The mixture is reacted with reflux while taking out almost the by produced water and further the reaction is continued with raising gradually the temperature while distilling off toluene from the system, by which there is obtained a viscous modified adduct acid value 23.0, total amine value 0, remaining toluene 3 by weight . The reactioin product thus obtained 30 g , an epi bis type epoxy resin derived from bisphenol A and epichlorohydrin epoxy equivalent weight 488 70 g , ethylene glycol ethyl ether monoacetate hereinafter, referred to as 11EGA 1 25 g , phenothiazine 0.25 g and benzyltrimethylammonium chloride 10 mg are reacted under nitrogen gas at 1500C for 3 hours, by which the acid value of the reaction system becomes zero 0 . The liquid modified epoxy resin has an epoxy equivalent weight of 760 converted as solid component calculated from the remaining epoxy groups thereof . The modified epoxy resin thus obtained was subjected to the following tests. The liquid modified epoxy resin. 10 g was mixed well with diaminodiphenylmethane 0.53 g , and the mixture was coated onto a soft steel panel and was cured at 1800C for 20 minutes to give a cured film having excellent clarity and gloss. From the excellent clarity of the cured film, it was confirmed that the polybutadiene component had sufficient compatibility with the epoxy resin. Besides, a cured film sample thickness 30 prepared in the same manner as above showed a pencil hardness of H. When the surface of the sample was crosscut in checkerboard like lines in squares of 1 mm x 1 mm and then the sample was bent by winding it around a column having a diameter of 4 mm so that the cut surface came outside, no change of the surface was observed. Besides, when a cellophane tape was adhered on the cut surface of the sample and thereafter was peeled off, neither peeling of the film nor relief was observed, by which it was confirmed that the cured film had sufficient flexibility and adhesion. For comparison purpose, unmodified epi bis type epoxy resin epoxy equivalent weight 488 10.0 g , diaminodiphenylmethane 1.04 g and EGA 2.5 g were mixed well, and the mixture was coated onto a soft steel panel and cured likewise to give a colorless cured film having excellent gloss thickness 30 p . This cured film showed a pencil hardness of H, but when it was crosscut in checkerboard like lines likewise, the cured film was partially broken and peeled off, and further, by subjecting the cut surface to the bending test and to peeling off test with a cellophane tape, the cured film was wholly peeled off. Example 2 The same liquid polybutadiene as used in Example 1 1280 g , maleic anhydride 320 g and iron naphthenate Fe 5.0 2.7 g are charged into a 2 liter four necked flask, and the mixture is reacted under nitrogen gas at 1900C for 4 hours to give maleinated polybutadiene total acid value 218 . Into a 500 ml four necked flask are charged the maleinated polybutadiene obtained above 250 g , butyl cellosolve 15.3 g , 2,6 di tert butyl 4 methylphenol hereinafter, referred to as BHT 2.5 g , toluene 67.0 g and benzyldimethylamine 0.16 ml , and the mixture is reacted under nitrogen gas at 1200C for 2 hours, by which the acid value of the reaction system becomes 151. To the reaction mixture is added a solution of cyclohexylamine 35.9 in toluene 35.6 g through a dropping funnel while controlling the raising temperature due to exotherm below 1300C. With giving attention to occurrence of foaming, the temperature of the reaction mixture is gradually raised until the final temperature becomes 1800C, during which the by produced water and toluene are distilled off.When all materials having low boiling points are removed and the acid value of the reaction product becomes equilibrium at 24.7, the heating is stopped, by which there is obtained a viscous modified adduct total amine value 0, remaining toluene less than 1 . The modified adduct thus obtained 200 g , an epi bis type epoxy resin epoxy equivalent weight 488 300 g , EGA 167 g and benzyltrimethylammonium chloride 67 mg are reacted under nitrogen gas at 1500C for 3 hours, by which the acid value of the reaction system becomes almost zero 0 .

When the liquid modified epoxy resin 267 g , EGA 28 g and diethanolamine 22.0 g are reacted under nitrogen gas at 800C for 3 hours, it is confirmed that the epoxy group is reacted. The epoxy resin containing an amino group obtained by the above reaction has a hydroxy group equivalent weight of 220 g eq. To the epoxy resin containing amino group obtained above is added dropwise a 70 solution 137 g of 2 ethylhexanol semiblocked tolylene diisocyanate 2,4 bond 2,6 bond 80 20 in EGA, and the mixture is reacted at 800C for 2 hours to give a urethane crosslinked type resin. The liquid resin thus obtained 450 g is neutralized with acetic acid 8.7 g with stirring, and thereto is gradually added a deionized water 1440 g to give a homogeneous electrocoating composition pH 6.0 This liquid composition is hereinafter referred to as A composition . A pigment paste is prepared as follows. The A composition obtained above 100 g , titanium oxide rutile type 72.9 g and carbon black 5.9 g are mixed with a paint conditioner for 30 minutes in order to disperse well the pigments. To A composition 1790 g is added with stirring dibutyl tin dilaurate 1.6 g , and thereto is gradually added the pigment paste obtained above 178.8 g to give a homogeneous cationic electrocoating composition. Example 3 The maleinated polybutadiene obtained in Example 2 200 g , allyl alcohol 6.0 g , BHT 1.0 g , toluene 79 g , benzyltrimethylammonium chloride 15 mg and aniline 27.0 g are reacted in the same manner as described in Example 1, by which the maleinated polybutadiene is semi esterified with allyl alcohol and then imidated with aniline, during which the by produced water and toluene are distilled off.As a result, there is obtained a modified adduct acid value 24.9, total amine value 0, remaining toluene 3.5 by weight, apparent viscosity at 60 C 680 P . The modified adduct thus obtained 150g , an epi bis type epoxy resin epoxy equivalent weight 488 350 g , EGA 167 g and benzyltrimethylammonium chloride 67 mg are reacted under nitrogen gas at 1500C for 3 hours, by which the acid value of the reaction system become almost zero 0 . By using the liquid modified epoxy resin thus obtained, a urethane crosslinked type resin is prepared in the same manner as described in Example 2, and further an electrocoating composition is prepared therefrom likewise. Example 4 In the same manner as described in Example 2, maleinated polybutadiene and butyl cellosolve are reacted to give a reaction product acid value 151 . The reaction product is subjected to imidation of the remaining acid anhydride groups with p aminophenol and aniline 1 2 by mole likewise, during which the by produced water and the solvent toluene are distilled off, by which there is obtained a viscous modified adduct acid value 24.8 . The modified adduct thus obtained 175 g and an epi bis type epoxy resin epoxy equivalent weight 488 325 g are reacted in EGA in the same manner as described inExample 2 to give a urethane crosslinked type resin, and further an electrocoating composition is prepared therefrom likewise. Reference Example 1 A mixture of an epi bis type epoxy resin epoxy equivalent weight 490 980 parts by weight and methyl isobutyl ketone 297 parts by weight are kept at 50 600C, and thereto is added dropwise diethanolamine 210 parts by weight over a period of 60 minutes, and the mixture is reacted for 60 minutes to give an amino group containing epoxy resin. To the resin thus obtained 660 parts by weight is added dropwise the same semi blocked tolylene diisocyanate as used in Example 2 412.4 parts by weight , and the mixture is reacted at 800C for 2 hours to give a urethane crosslinked type resin nonvolatile part 70 .The liquid resin thus obtained is neutralized with acetic acid with stirring and thereto is added a deionized water 3733.4 parts by weight to give a homogeneous electrocoating composition pH 6.0 . By using this composition, a homogeneous cationic electrocoating composition is prepared in the same manner as described in Example 2. The composition has a nonvolatile part of 20 and a pigment weight concentration of 20 t. The cationic electrocoating compositions prepared in Examples 2, 3 and 4 and Reference Example 1 were subjected to electrocoating by using a steel plate treated with iron phosphate as a cathode and carbon plate as an anode at 300C with stirring at 120 V for 3 minutes. After the electrocoating, the coated steel plate was washed with water, and cured at 1800C for 20 minutes to give a cured film having excellent gloss and gray color.

The samples were dipped into hot water at 500C for 500 hours. After removal of the sample films from dipping bath, the wet surfaces of the sample films were wiped softly and air dried. A cellophane tape was adhered on the surface of the sample film crosscut and was peeled off. The number of squared remained without being peeled off was counted, and the results are shown as the number of remained squared 100 original number of squares . 2 The test samples were bent by winding them around a column having a diameter of 2 mm, and the surface was observed. 3 A load of 500 g was fallen on the test samples on the coated surface or on the reverse side from the height of 50 cm at a point of impact of 1 2 , and the degree of damage of the coating film was observed. 4 A 5 saline 350C was sprayed onto the coated surface of the test samples for 1000 hours, and the degree of damage of the coated film was observed. As is clear from the above test results, it was confirmed that the compositions of Examples 2, 3, and 4 of the present invention showed sufficient flexibility and adhesion and also excellent corrosion resistance. Example 5 The modified adduct obtained in Example 2 80 g , an epi bis type epoxy resin epoxy equivalent weight 187 120 g and benzyltrimethylammonium chloride 20 mg are reacted under nitrogen gas at 1500C for 2 hours to give a pale yellow clear modified resin acid value 0, epoxy equivalent weight 370, viscosity at 500C 10,000 cp . The modified epoxy resin thus obtained 100 parts by weight and diaminodiF .enylmethane 25 parts by weight are mixed, poured into a fixed mold and then cured under the conditions of 800C for 2 hours, 1200C for 2 hours, and 1600C for 2 hours in series. The cured product thus obtained were subjected toCharpy impact test and also to a thermal shock test. The thermal shock test was carried out as follows The epoxy resin composition was cured in an aluminum made cup diameter 5 cm, height 1.5 cm wherein a bolt nnt washer was contained. The resulting cured product wherein the washer was embedded was taken out, and was subjected to heating cooling cycle, i.e. repeating of heating at 1000C and then cooling at OOC for each 30 minutes, and then, the number of the cycle until the sample was cracked was counted. For comparison purpose, in the same manner as above except that an unmodified epi bis type epoxy resin epoxy equivalent weight 187 was used instead of the modified epoxy resin, a cured test sample was prepared and subjected to the tests, likewise.

Into a 500 ml four necked flask are charged the maleinated polybutadine obtained above 200 g , BHT 1.0 g , allyl alcohol 10.9 g and benzyldimethylamine 0.1 g , and the mixture is reacted at 900C for 2 hours, and thereto is added dropwise aniline 30.0 g through a dropping funnel.The mixture is reacted at 1600C for 3 hours while taking out the by produced water, by which there is obtained a viscous modified adduct total amine value 0, acid value 44.8, viscosity at 600C 4,610 cp . It is confirmed that the acid anhydride groups in the maleinated polybutadiene are converted into semi ester groups and imido groups by the above analytical data and IR spectrum. The modified adduct thus obtained 40 g and an epi bis type epoxy resin epoxy equivalent weight 488 60 g are reacted under nitrogen gas at 1500C for 3 hours to give a homogeneous modified epoxy resin being rich in clarity acid value 0, epoxy equivalent weight 1095 . The modified epoxy resin thus obtained was subjected to the following tests. The modified epoxy resin 10 g , diaminodiphenylmethane 0.46 g and EGA 30 g were mixed well and the resulting solution was coated onto a soft steel panel and cured at 1800C for 20 minutes to give a homogeneous clear cured film pencil hardness H . A cured coating film thickness 30 p was prepared likewise and crosscut in the same manner as described in Example 1, followed by subjecting to the bending test and peeling test of a cellophane tape likewise.As a result, no change of the coating surface and hence, it was confirmed that the coating film showed excellent flexibility and adhesion. Reference Example 2 Into a 200 ml four necked flask are charged a liquid polybutadiene containing terminal COOH group molecular weight 1450, acid value 56, 1,2 vinyl bond 91 30 g , an epi bis type epoxy resin epoxy equivalent weight 488 70 g , EGA 34 g , BHT 0.5 g and benzyltrimethylammonium chloride 15 mg , and the mixture is reacted under nitrogen gas at 1500C for 3 hours to give a modified epoxy resin acid value almost 0, epoxy equivalent weight 889 converted as solid material 3. When the modified epoxy resin thus obtained was distilled under reduced pressure to remove the solvent, there was obtained a white opaque resin, by which it was assumed that the polybutadiene component of the resin was not sufficiently compatible with the epoxy resin. Besides, when the modified epoxy resin 10 g was mixed with diaminophenylmethane 0.43 g , and the resulting mixture was coated onto a soft steel panel and cured at 1800C for 20 minutes, there was obtained an opaque coating film thickness 20 y , from which the inferior compatibility was re confirmed. Moreover, the surface of the coating film was somewhat shrunk, and when it was crosscut likewise, it showed blush and inferior adhesion by the peeling test of a cellophane tape. Reference Example 3 The maleinated polybutadiene obtained in Example 1, i.e. 20 by weight maleinated product of a liquid polybutadiene number average molecular weight 1680, cis 1,4 structure 76 80 g , toluene 20 g , ethylene glycol monobutyl ether 4.5 g , BHT 0.1 g andN,N dimethylbenzylamine 50 mg are reacted under nitrogen gas at 1300C for 1 hour to give a partially esterified product. The reaction mixture is heated to 700C and thereto are added gradually M,N dimethylpropane diamine 12.7 g and toluene 10 g , and the mixture is stirred at the some temperature for 1 hour.The mixture is heated until the final temperature becomes 1700C while taking out toluene and by produced water to give a modified product acid value 23.0, total amine value 72.0 about 96 g . The partially esterified imidated product thus obtained 40 g , an epi bis type epoxy resin epoxy equivalent weight 488 60 g , EGA 42.8 g and BHT 0.1 g are reacted under nitrogen gas at 1500C for several tens of minutes, at when the reaction mixture shows suddenly increased viscosity and finally gives an insoluble gel material. It is assumed that this phenomenon is due to ring opening and polymerization of the large amounts of epoxy groups which is catalyzed by the aliphatic tertiary amine having strong basicity bonded to the polybutadiene chain via imido bond, with proceeding of the reaction between carboxyl groups and epoxy groups. From this reference example, it is clear that such diamine which remains a comparatively strong basic aliphatic amine nitrogen in the molecule can not be used as an imidating agent for the modifying process of the present invention wherein a part of the epoxy groups in epoxy resin is modified and the remaining almost epoxy groups are remained in the free form for using them the subsequent reactions.
