# Drill bit having abradable cutter protection.

## Abstract
A rotary drill bit 10, 12 for drilling earth formations has a plurality of cutting elements 16 mounted on the head portion of the bit. The bit further includes a plurality of individual protrusions 20 projecting from the head portion more than the extension of the cutting element 16 . The protrusions 20 are fabricated of a metal more readily abraded by the earth formation than any of the cutting elements 16 . The protrusions 20 protect the cutting elements 16 during handling of the bit and entry of the bit into a borehole and, the protectors 20 are abraded away to expose the cutting elements 16 during drilling.
