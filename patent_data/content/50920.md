# Combination coupling and sheave.

## Abstract
A combination coupling and sheave in a variable speed belt drive in which a variable pitch sheave has a fixed flange 40 , an axially shiftable flange 42 and a shaft 18 connected to the drive motor by a flexible coupling 90 with the hubs thereof secured to the motor and sheave shaft. The inventive concept includes mounting the coupling hub 120 on the sheave shaft 18 in a bearing 24 of a pillow block 20 at the end of the shaft and connecting the fixed flange 40 of the sheave to the hub 120 , so that the fixed flange 40 is driven directly by the hub rather than solely by the shaft, and the slidable flange 42 is driven through the shaft, thus creating split power paths between the flexible coupling 90 and the fixed flange 40 and between the coupling 90 and the slidable flange 42 through the sheave shaft 18 , thereby reducing the load on the operating parts of the sheave.
