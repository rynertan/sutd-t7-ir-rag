# A base for a Christmas tree or the like.

## Abstract
A Christmas tree base or the like with a cross shaped stand or the like, on the legs 4 of which holders 6 for the trunk or the like are provided, which by springs 9 are capable to draw the holders 6 to the centre of the base. A cam disc 10 is located centrally in the base. The cams of said disc 10 upon rotation in one direction push the holders 6 outward from the centre. Upon rotation in the other direction, the springs 9 draw the holders 6 inward to the centre whereby the holders 6 with their upper portion abut the trunk. The holders 6 are slidable on the legs 4 with a certain play, so that a chest drawer effect arises upon abutment of the holders to the trunk and thereby locking is effected. The springs 9 , therefore, can be dimensioned so small that the rotation of the disc 10 in one direction or the other does not require much force, because the disc 10 preferably is located in such a plane that it automatically neutralizes the action of the chest drawer effect .
