A 30912 Factor H A 30912 factor H A 30912H is a newly discovered component of the A 30912 antibiotic mixture.A 30912H is described in a co pending application 80301913.2 entitled A 30912.FACTOR H Under conditions knows thus far, A 30912H is a minor factor in the A 30912 mixture, being present in amounts in the range of from about 0.01 to about 1.0 percent of the total mixture. Another minor factor of the A 30912 mixture has been recognized, but has not been isolated in an amount sufficient for characterization. A 30912 factor H is best separated from this factor by silica gel TLC using an ethyl acetate methanol 3 2 or an acetonitrile water 95 5 solvent system.In either system, the uncharacterized minor factor is more polar than the other A 30912 factors. A 30912 factor is a white amorphous solid.Elemental analysis of A 30912H gave the following approximate percentage composition carbon, 58.27 hydrogen, 7.49 nitrogen, 867 oxygen, 24.99 . A 30912 factor H has a molecular weight of about 1073. This molecular weight is based upon peak matching FD FD of the quasimolecular ions of A 30912 factor A C52H81N7O16 and A 30912 factor H. The quasimolecular ion of A 30912 factor H Na was found to have the mass 1096.5782, 1096.5814. The mean mass, 1096.5798, is within experimental error for C53H83N7016 Na, which has a theoretical mass of 1096.57940. The approximate empirical formula of A 30912 factor H is, therefore, believed to be C53H83N7016. The elemental analysis of A 3.0912 factor H corresponds especially well with the empirical formula of C53H83N7016 H2O Calcd. C, 58.30 H, 7.79 N, 8.98 0, 24.93 . The infrared absorption spectrum of A 30912 factor H in KBr disc is shown in Figure 1 of the accompanying drawings. The following characteristic absorption maxima are observed 2.9 very strong , 3.4 strong , 3.5 medium , 5.9 6.1 very strong , 6.6 strong , 6.9 strong , 7.9 8.1 medium , and 9.1 strong microns. The ultraviolet absorption spectra of A 30912 factor H in both neutral and acidic methanol exhibit absorption maxima at 223 nm E 13,100 and 275 nm, broad peak e 2,100 . The ultraviolet spectrum ofA 30912 factor H in basic methanol shows absorption maxima at 245 nm e 14,700 and 290 nm, broad peak e 3,500 , and also end absorption. The C nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum of A 30912 factor H in perdeuteromethanol shows the following characteristics 6 176.07, 174.15, 173.49, 172.56, 172.47, 169.88, 158.45, 133.01, 130.90, 129.52, 129.04, 116.21, 82.15, 77.00, 75.98, 75.71, 71.27, 69.55, 69.42, 68.22, 62.44, 58.69, 57.25, 56.81, 56.08, 52.88, 51.32, 39.08, 38.60, 36.89, 32.65, 30.77, 30.45, 30.26, 28.18, 27.14, 26.55, 20.11, 19.60, 11.33. A 30912 factor H has the following approximate specific rotations alpha D25 40 c 0.5, CH3OH alpha 25365 151 c 0.5, CH3OH Electrometric titration of A 30912 factor H in 66 aqueous dimethylformamide indicated the presence of a titratable group with a pK value of about 12.90 initial pH 7.12 . Amino acid analysis of A 3.0912 factor H indicated the presence, after hydrolysis, of threonine and four other as yet unidentified amino acids. A 30912 factor H is soluble in a variety of organic solvents such as methanol, ethanol, dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, and ethyl acetate but is insoluble in nonpolar organic solvents such as diethyl ether and petroleum ether. A 30912 factor H is also soluble in aqueous solutions, especially those having a pH greater than 7.0. A 30912 factor H mol. wt. 1073 differs fromA 30912 factor A mol. wt. 1059 by only 14 mass units. Both compounds are very similar in physicalchemical properties, and both compounds produce linoleic acid upon hydrolysis. A 30912 factor H is, therefore, believed to be structurally related toA 30912 factor A. A 30912H appears to have an addi tional CH2 which is present as O CH3, replacing one of the OH groups in the cyclic peptide portion of the molecule. A 30912H is believed to have the structure shown in formula 4 EMI9.1 R linoleoyl 4 The Rf values of A 30912 factors A G, using high carbon content silica gel TLC, a benzene methanol 7 3 solvent system, and Candida albicans bioautography are given in Table I.

The Tetrahydro A 30912 Derivatives A 30912 factors A, B, D and H each have a linoleoyl side chain. The tetrahydro derivatives of A 30912 factors A, B, D, and H can be prepared by reducing. the double bonds in this side chain using standard methods. The process of this inventiOn is also useful for purification of these tetrahydroderivatives, e.g. compounds of formulas 1 and 2 wherein R is stearoyl. B. The Aculeacin Factors The aculeacin mixture, comprising aculeacin A as a major factor and minor factors B, C, D, E, F, andG, is prepared as described by Mizuno et al. in U.S. Patent 3,978,210. The aculeacin mixture is produced byAspergillus aculeatus M 4214 FERM P 2324 , NRRL 8075.Aculeacin factors Aa, Ay, Da and Dy are produced byAspergillus aculeatus M 4845, NRRL 11270, as described in Belgian Patent 866,095. Although there is no published information on the structure of the aculeacin antibiotics, it is recognized that they are analogous to the A 30912 antibiotics see S Satoi et al., J. Antibiotics 30, 303 307 1977 . The possibility that aculeacin A has the same cyclic peptide nucleus as tetrahydro A 30912A is discussed in Belgian Patent 859,067. It is reported that palmitoyl is the fatty acid side chain of aculeacins A,Ay, B, C, D, Dy, E, F, and G and that myristoyl is the fatty acid side chain of aculeacins ACL and DCL.

Antibiotic S 31794 F 1 Antibiotic S 31794 F l, which is disclosed inGerman Offenlegungschrift 2,628,965 and in U.S. Patent 4,173,629, is an antifungal compound produced byAcrophialophora limonispora nov. spec.

Antibiotic S 31794 F 1 is believed to have structure 5, as follows EMI15.1 R myristoyl 5 The Recovery Process The improved process of this invention comprises purifying A 30912 type antibiotics by reversedphase liquid chromatography LC using a high carbon content silica gel absorbent. Such purification generally involves separating the component factors from the mixture in which they are produced. This process may also be used, however, for purification of the antibiotics and for purification of derivatives of the antibiotics, such as, for example, the tetrahydroA 30912 derivatives. Reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography HPLC is a preferred method of this invention. Reversed phase high performance, low pressure liquid chromatography HPLPLC is an especially preferred method. Reversed phase LC using a high carbon content silica gel may be used for large scale preparative separations. It is more efficient and faster than previously used separation processes. In addition, the antibiotics obtained by this process are generally of improved purity. The crude antibiotic mixture can be recovered from the fermentation medium in which it is produced by processes known in the fermentation art. When using the process of this invention, a preliminary chromatographic separation using a standard absorbent may be used to remove gross impurities from the antibiotic mixture. Suitable absorbents for such an initial separation include silica gel Florisil Sephadex G 25, LH 20, and G 15 alumina Diaion HP 20 and Amberlite XAD 4 and X 384. Diaion is available from Mitsubishi Chemical Industries, Tokyo the Amberlite resins are available from Rohm and Haas Co., Philadelphia,Pa. the Sephadex resins are available from PharmaciaFine Chemicals AB, Uppsala, Sweden and Florisil is available from Floridin Co., Tallahassee, Fla. In the process of this invention the factors of the antibiotic mixture are rapidly and efficiently separated by LC using reversed phase resins of high carbon content. High carbon content refers to a carbon content of 15 percent or above. Preferably, the carbon content is in the range from about 19 to about 22 percent. Such reversed phase resins have a high loading capacity. Two such resins include LiChroprepRP 8 and RP 18 which are available from E. Merck,Darmstadt, Germany. In addition, a high loading capacity silica gel C18, prepared from Quantum LP 1 silica gel Whatman , which has a carbon content of about 20 percent is described in Reference Example 2. The preparation involves silylation with octadecyltrichlorosilane and a second silylation to complete the high carbon loading.After the first silylation, the carbon content is in the range of from 10 14 . The second silylation increases the carbon content to 15 percent or above.The percentage of carbon achieved by the second silylation depends upon the amount of reagent used. Thus, using less reagent gives a lower carbon content. A carbon content of 15 percent or above is necessary to give the more efficient isolation of this invention. In carrying out the process of this invention, the antibiotic to be purified is dissolved in an appropriate solvent, and the resulting solution is placed on a column equilibrated with the same or similar solvent.The column is then eluted with solvent. Generally, the same solvent or solvent system is used initially.Later the polarity of the solvent may be gradually changed to effect the required separation. The solvent or solvent system chosen will depend upon the solubility of the antibiotic. Those in the field will recognize that more than one solvent system may be used, but that certain solvent systems are preferred. For example, methanol water acetonitrile is a preferred solvent system for A 30912 type antibiotics, and methanol water acetonitrile in a ratio of 7 2 1 is an especially preferred solvent system. Fractions collected are conveniently monitored by bioautography against a sensitive microorganism and or by W based on relative retention times . Fractions containing the desired factor are combined. It is sometimes necessary to carry out an additional chromatographic separation in order to obtain the antibiotic factor in especially purified form. To illustrate the method of this invention,A 30912 factors A, B, D and H can be separated by reversed phase HPLPLC using the following conditions Column glass, 0.8 x 15.0 cm Packing Nucleosile 10 C18 Machery Nagel and Company packed using slurry packing pro cedure of Reference Example 3.

Separation of the A 42355 Antibiotic Mixture Whole fermentation broth 4127 liters , obtained by the method described in Section B usingMedium II, was stirred thoroughly with methanol 4280 liters for one hour and then was filtered, using a filter aid Hyflo Super cel, a diatomaceous earth,Johns Manville Products Corp. .The pH of the filtrate was adjusted to pH 4.0 by the addition of 5 N HC1. The acidified filtrate was extracted twice with equal volumes of chloroform. The chloroform extracts were combined and concentrated under vacuum to a volume of about 20 liters. This concentrate was added to about 200 liters of diethyl ether to precipitate the A 42355 mixture. The precipitate was separated by filtration to give 2775 g of the A 42355 mixture as a gray white powder. Reference Example 2Preparation of Silica Gel C18 Reversed Phase ResinStep 1 Hydrolysis LP silica gel 1000 g from Quantum Corp., now Whatman is added to a mixture of concentrated sulfuric acid 1650 ml and concentrated nitric acid 1650 ml in a 5 L round bottom flask and shaken for proper suspension. The mixture is heated on a steam bath overnight 16 hours with a water jacketed condenser attached to the flask. The mixture is cooled in an ice bath and carefully filtered using a sintered glass funnel. The silica gel is washed with deionized water until the pH is neutral. The silica gel is then washed with acetone 4 L and dried under vacuum at 1000C. for 2 days. Step 2 First Silylation The dry silica gel from Step 1 is transferred to a round bottom flask and suspended in toluene 3.5L . The flask is heated on a steam bath for 2 hours to azeotrope off some residual water. Octadecyltrichlorosilane 321 ml, Aldrich Chemical Company is added, and the reaction mixture is refluxed overnight 16 hours with slow mechanical stirring at about 60 C. Care is taken so that the stirrer does not reach near the bottom of the flask. This is to prevent grinding the silica gel particles. The mixture is allowed to cool. The silanized silica gel is collected, washed with toluene 3 L and acetone 3 L , and then air dried overnight 16 20 hours . The dried silica gel is suspended in 3.5 L of acetonitrile water 1 1 in a 5 L flask, stirred carefully at room temperature for 2 hours, filtered, washed with acetone 3 L and air dried overnight.Step 3 Second Silylation The procedure from the first silylation is repeated using 200 ml of octadecyltrichlorosilane. The suspension is refluxed at 600C. for 2 hours while stirring carefully. The final product is recovered by filtration, washed with toluene 3 L and methanol 6 L , and then dried under vacuum at 500C. overnight 16 20 hours . Reference Example 3Slurry Packing Procedure for Michel Miller ColumnsGeneral Information A. Analytical or preparative columns can be packed by this procedure. B. Silica gels e.g., QuantumLP 1, particle size 10 20 microns and silica gel reversed phase packings e.g., LiChroprep RP 8 and RP 18, particle size 25 40 microns are recommended. However, other silica gels e.g., Shandons ODS Hypersil, particle size 5 microns as well as other types of resins have been packed successfully by this procedure. C. Generally, a pressure of less than 200 psi and flow rates between 5 40 ml minute are required for this slurry packing technique this is dependent on column volume and size. Packing pressure should exceed pressure used during actual separation by 30 50 psi this will assure no further compression of the adsorbent during separation runs. Columns packed by this procedure with reversed phase silica gel can be operated for several years without loss of efficiency. D. Sudden decrease in pressure may cause cracks or channels to form in the packing material, which would greatly reduce column efficiency. Therefore, it is important to let the pressure drop slowly to zero whenever the pump has been turned off. E. Approximate volume of columns Ace GlassCat. No., unpacked 5795 04, 12 ml 5795 10, 110 ml 5795 16, 300 ml 5795 24, 635 ml and 5796 34, 34 ml. F. The time required to pack a glass column will vary from minutes to several hours depending on column size and experience of the scientist.Procedure 1. Connect glass column to a reservoir column via coupling volume of reservoir column should be twice that of the column . Place both columns in vertical positions reservoir column above . 2. Weigh out packing material ca. 100 g for 200 ml column . 3. Add ca. five volumes of solvent to packing material use a mixture of 70 808 methanol and 20 30 water. 4. Shake well until all particles are wetted, let stand overnight or longer to assure complete soaking of particles by solvent. Decant supernatant. 5. Slurry the resin with sufficient solvent to fill reservoir column. Pour swiftly into reservoir.The column must be pre filled with the same solvent and the reservoir column should be partly filled with solvent before slurry is poured. The use of larger slurry volumes may also provide good results however, this will require a larger reservoir or b multiple reservoir fillings during the packing procedure. 6. Close reservoir with the Teflon plug beneath the column see Figure 1 of U.S. Patent 4,131,547, plug No. 3 connect to pump and immediately start pumping solvent through system at maximum flow rate ifAce Cat. No. 13265 25 Pump or similar solvent delivery system is used ca. 20 ml minute . 7. Continue until column is completely filled with adsorbent. Pressure should not exceed maximum tolerance of column during this operation ca.200 psi for large columns and 300 psi for analytical columns . In most cases, pressures less than 200 psi will be sufficient. 8. Should pressure exceed maximum values, reduce flow rate pressure will drop. 9. After column has been filled with adsorbent, turn off pump let pressure drop to zero disconnect reservoir replace reservoir with a pre column fill pre column with solvent and small amount of adsorbent and pump at maximum pressure until column is completely packed. Always allow pressure to decrease slowly after turning off pump this will prevent formation of any cracks or channels in the packing material. 10. Relieve pressure and disconnect precolumn carefully. With small spatula remove a few mm 2 4 of packing from top of column place 1 or more filter s on top of column gently depress to top of packing material, and place Teflon plug on top of column until seal is confirmed. Connect column to pump, put pressure on usually less than 200 psi and observe through glass wall on top of column if resin is packing any further. If packing material should continue to settle this may be the case with larger columns , some dead space or channelling will appear and step 9 should be repeated.
