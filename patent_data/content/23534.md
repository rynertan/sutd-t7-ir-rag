# SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICE MOUNTING STRUCTURE AND METHOD OF MOUNTING

## Abstract
An improved semiconductor chip mounting structure and method by which a semiconductor chip is attached to a substrate by soldering using mass production techniques while excess solder is draw off to prevent shorting of the device to the substrate. At least one capillary structure is provided passing through the substrate in the region under the semiconductor chip so that excess solder between the chip and substrate are drawn off into the capillary aperture instead of forming an excessively large fillet and possibly shorting out the device. In a preferred form the capillary means is a small diameter hole punched through the sub strate during lead frame fabrication.
