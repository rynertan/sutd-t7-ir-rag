# Magnetic head slider.

## Abstract
A magnetic head slider 20 which comprises a path defined between the bottom plane 21 of the slider and the operation plane 32a of a magnetic disc 32 through which compressed air steams flow at the rotation of the magnetic disc 32 to let the slider 20 float from the operation plane 32a of the magnetic disc 32 and pressure reducing inclined grooves 28, 29 which are formed on the down stream side of said compressed air stream path to conduct part of the compressed air steams obliquely downward.
