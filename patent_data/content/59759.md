# COPYING CONTROL SYSTEM.

## Abstract
A copying control system in which the direction of pick feed is determined according to a copy travel direction signal VTD based on the output of a phase discriminating circuit PD and the direction of pick feed input from an input unit. The pick feed is driven by a profile copy, so that the plane of the pick feed can be in the X Y plane in the case of copying working along a semi spherical model or the like. The copy travel direction signal VTD designates that the direction of tangent velocity if 90 or 90 to the direction of the normal line, and then, according to whether the copy travel direction signal VTD is 0 or 1 , the polarity of a delivered tangent direction velocity signal VT is inverted. A gate circuit GC selects output amplifier circuits DRX, DRY, DRZ , the out puts of which drive motors MX, MY, MZ , respectively. Thus, in the case of copying a semi spherical model, the plane of pick feed corresponds to that of profile copying, i.e., is in the X Y plane.
