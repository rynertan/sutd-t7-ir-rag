## Description
FUEL CELL INTEGRATED WITH STEAM REFORMER BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention This invention relates to a fuel cell system integrated to utilize hydrogen produced by steam reforming of methanol as well as a method and apparatus for producing a hydrogen containing gas by steam reforming of methanol. This reformer is particularly suitable for use in an integrated fuel cell system for producing electric power from methanol. 2. The Prior Art Fuel cells generate electricity through galvanic combustion of fuel process gas with oxidant process gas.Typically oxidant gas can be obtained from the fuel cell environment with little, if any, processing. The fuel process gas, on the other hand, is usually hydrogen and its generation requires processing of other fuels such as methanol. Direct oxidation of fuels such as methanol in fuel cells at practical current densities with acceptable catalyst loadings is not as economically attractive as conversion of methanol fuel to a hydrogen rich mixture of gases via steam reforming and subsequent electrochemical conversion of the hydrogen rich fuel stream to direct current in the fuel cell. In addition, during recent years, industrial requirements for hydrogen have increased rapidly, and a variety of processes for the manufacture of hydrogen have been developed to fill this need. Large quantities of hydrogen are used, for example, in synthesis of ammonia for catalytic hydrogenation, for example, of oils to solid fats in petroleum processes such as hydrofining and as a fuel, e.g. in missiles and in fuel cells for the generation of electricity. A very attractive fuel cell system currently undergoing commercial consideration is the reformed methanol fuel phosphoric acid electrolyte air system.Primary advantages of phosphoric acid electrolyte 85 wt. include ability to operate with fuel and ambient air containing CO2, ability to operate with a thin matrix electrolyte no liquid circulation and chemical stability of the electrolyte over the operating temperature of the cell, e.g. 180 2000C. The fuel cell itself is only part of the overall system, and other components of the system, e.g., generation of hydrogen fuel, are likewise important in terms of overall system size and cost effectiveness. In one method used by the art to produce hydrogen by steam reforming, a methanol and steam feedstock is passed through catalyst filled tubes disposed within a reactor or reformer which is shaped much like a conventional shell and tube heat exchanger except that the tubes contain catalysts. In these reactors, hot gases typically combustion products are passed through the shell of the heat exchanger while the methanol and water vapor is passed through the tubes. Thus, the heat required for the endothermic catalytic reforming reaction taking place within the tubes at about 3000 C must pass through the wall of the tube. In these prior art processes, the mixture of methanol and steam is converted to a gaseous stream consisting primarily of hydrogen about 68 and CO2 about 21.7 , CO about 1.5 and H2O about 8.8 .In order to improve the thermal and chemical efficiency of such reactors, efforts have been directed to improve the uniformity of heat distribution in the tubes within the reactor to secure high chemical conversion of fuel into hydrogen and maintain catalyst bed temperature within certain limits 700OF in order to avoid premature catalyst aging while minimizing the amount of energy used to produce each unit of hydrogen containing gas. For the most efficient operation of the steam reforming reaction, large surface areas are required to transfer the heat from the combusted gases to the tubes.In reformers presently used for steam reforming, small diameter reaction tubes are clustered closely together in the furnace so that heat transfer from the combusting gases in the reactor into the catalyst packed tubes is optimized. The use of a plurality of tubes to accomplish heat transfer contributes to the large size and high cost of the reformer. A second drawback to such reformers is that the heat for the steam reforming process is provided indirectly by means of heat transfer through tube walls.This inefficient heat transfer has a detrimental effect in fuel cell systems in which the reformer and, the fuel cell are fully integrated, i.e the combustion gases for the reforming reaction are derived from the fuel cell exhaust since the shell side heat transfer coefficient between the hot gas and the tube is characteristically low and hence, the rate of reaction is limited primarily by the rate of heat transfer. This problem is particularly severe at the reactor entrance as the rate of the endothermic reaction is very high, and thus, the amount of heat required is very high while the shell side heat transfer coefficient is often low as the mechanical design of typical reactors often allows the gases in the shell to be relatively stagnant near the tube, entrances.This leads to a drop in the overall efficiency as a large portion of each reactor tube operates at an undesirably low temperature. Thus, in order to effect complete conversion, the reformer must be relatively large and expensive since, at the inlet of the reformer, it is impossible, because of the highly endothermic nature of the reaction, to supply enough heat to the surface area of the reformer tubes so there tends to be a large decrease in reactant temperature in the area adjacent the inlet. It is the primary object of the present invention to provide a novel process and apparatus for the production of hydrogen by steam reforming of methanol that can be accomplished with a thermally efficient reformer of reduced size and cost which can be integrated with a fuel cell power system or used as a stand alone hydrogen generator. According to the present invention, production of hydrogenaby steam reforming of methanol or other hydrocarbon fuels is accomplished in a reformer of substantially reduced size by superheating a gaseous mixture of water and methanol to a temperature of about 7000 to about 1100OF. and then passing the superheated gaseous mixture over a catalyst bed contained in a reformer. At least a substantial portion of the heat for the endothermic steam reforming reaction is provided by the sensible heat in the super heated steam methanol stream augmented by heat transferred through the tube wall depending on the overall system considerations. The concept of providing a substantial portion of the heat for the endothermic reforming reaction by sensible heat in the superheated steam methanol stream is referred to hence forth as direct heating. Direct heating is of considerable advantage as it largely overcomes the problems encountered with reaction rates being limited by the rate of heat transfer through the tube wall especially near the reformer entrance and thus, for a given conversion, the reactor may be smaller, more efficient and less expensive. As compared to the prior art, high steam to methanol ratios are required for direct heated reformers, typically in the range of from 1 to as high as 10.The relatively large amounts of steam passed through the bed continuously clean the catalyst by removing ethanol and suppressing production of carbon monoxide and retard catalyst poisoning thereby enhancing catalyst stability. Direct heated reformers are particularly suitable for integration with fuel cells as the heat and fuel values contained in exhaust stream from each component can be utilized in the other. Hydrogen contained in the exhaust gas from the fuel cell anode may be burned to superheat the methanol water mixture being fed to the reformer. In some embodiments, once the reactor is warmed up, the entire fuel requirements for the system are provided by the methanol being fed to the reformer. As a result of direct heating of the reformer feed gases augmenting indirect heat transfer through the wall of the reactor, a shell and multiple tube reactor arrangement or other means of increasing the heat transfer surface is not always required and the complexity and overall volume of the reformer can be substantially reduced. Another aspect of this invention is based upon the realization that an efficient practical integrated reformer fuel cell system and process can be achieved by using a superheater, an essentially adiabatic methanol reformer and a fuel cell wherein the various exhaust streams from the components are utilized with other components of the system.In this system, the water to methanol ratio and temperature of the stream leaving the superheater are of such values that substantially all at least about 75 , preferably 90 of the heat required for the endothermic reforming reaction is contained within the reaction stream itself and, at most, only a small portion of the heat required for reforming is supplied through the wall of the reforming reactor.In addition to the reformer size reduction achieved by the use of direct heating, a further reduction in reactor size is achieved by use of an essentially adiabatic reactor since it is highly advantageous to integrate the direct heating steam reforming process with a fuel cell to form a fuel cell system whereby a continuous supply of hydrogen could be provided to the fuel cell from an essentially adiabatic steam reformer, the gases exhausted from the anode of the fuel cell providing thermal energy via combustion for superheating the water methanol mixture. It is therefore a primary object of the present invention to efficiently integrate a fuel cell with the steam reforming process to provide a thermochemical process for producing electrical energy in which the heat required for, the endothermic reforming reaction is contained substantially completely within the stream fed to the reformer which produces hydrogen for a fuel cell so that a compact and efficient system may be obtained. The above object of the invention is achieved in accordance with the fuel cell system of the present invention comprised of a heat exchanger, a burner, an adiabatic steam reformer and a fuel cell wherein a superheated mixture of water and methanol is first converted by an essentially adiabatic endothermic catalytic reforming reaction to hydrogen. The hydrogen, generated in the reformer, is directed to the fuel electrode, of the fuel cell, and air is directed to the oxygen electrode to effect an, electrochemical reaction to produce electricity and gaseous reaction products. A portion of the exhaust gases from the fuel electrode is combustible as it contains unreacted hydrogen.Furthermore, it is desirable to withdraw this portion of gas from the fuel cell to maintain a hydrogen rich stream in the fuel cell thus optimizing fuel cell operation in accordance with the present state of the fuel cell art.The combustible gas exhausted from the fuel electrode is burned in the burner, the exhaust of which is fed to the heat exchanger to supply heat for superheating the water methanol mixture fed to the reformer. Even though large amounts of water are used in the system and thus more heat is required to vaporize and preheat these methanol water mixtures containing large amounts of water, the heat generated can be effectively recovered and used in the system and process of the present invention. Further, parasitic power requirements are decreased, and the low concentration of carbon monoxide in the reformate should lead to improved fuel cell efficiency and extended fuel cell life, so the net methanol demand remains essentially constant or may decrease slightly around 20 .Thus, the net energy production is at lease substantially equivalent to that obtained using mixtures containing lesser amounts of water. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Having set forth its general nature, the invention will best be understood from the subsequent more detailed description wherein reference will be made to the accompanying drawings which illustrate systems suitable for practicing the present invention. Reference is now made to Figure 1 of the drawings which schematically illustrates a flow scheme in accordance with this invention of the steam reforming of methanol for the production of hydrogen therefrom. As illustrated in Figure 1, a water and methanol feedstock having a water methanol mole ratio ranging from about 1.0 to about 10.0, preferably about 2.0 to about 9.0, and more preferably about 2.5 to about 4.0, is supplied via conduit 10 to vaporizer 11 wherein the water methanol feed supplied thereto is heated to a temperature of about 200 to about 5000F to convert the feedstock into a gaseous mixture. The hot gaseous steam methanol stream then exits the vaporizer via line 12 and is supplied to superheater coil 13 contained in burner 14.The gaseous mixture contained in coil 13 is superheated to a temperature of about 700 to about 11000F, and preferably about 8500F to about 10000 F, the fuel for heating the mixture being supplied to burner 14 via conduit 16 together with an oxidizing gas such as air or another oxygen containing gas via conduit 15. When the reforming system is integrated with a fuel cell, the fuel burned in the burner 13 includes unreacted hydrogen gas exhausted from the anode side of the fuel cell which undergoes combusstion with an oxidizing gas sucd as air or oxygen.In one embodiment of the inventory, the temperature and composition of the methanol steam mixture leaving the superheater are such that at most only minimal additional heat will be required to obtain essentially complete conversion of the methanol contained therein. Table I sets forth the variation in weight hourly space velocity and thereby reactor size obtained by varying the methanol water mole ratio of 4.5 to 9.0. Table I Projected WHSV for 99.8 Reformer MethanolWHSV H2O MeOH Inlet Temp.

For purposes of the present invention, H2O to MeOH mole ratios of from about 2.5 to about 4.5 are preferred at temperatures of from about 9000 to about 11000F. Gases resulting from the combustion reaction may exit burner 14 via line 14A to reformer 18 in contact with the outside of the catalyst bed. This would provide some additional heat to the reforming reaction and prevent heat loss from reactor 18, thereby reducing the size of reactor 18. In the embodiment in which all of the heat for the reforming reaction is supplied by preheating of the reformer feed gases, reformer 18 can be constructed in the form of a single tube having a length to diameter aspect ratio of less than 10 1, preferably less than 8 1, more preferably less than 6 1, most preferably from about 2 1 to about 6 1. The superheated steam methanol gaseous mixture exits superheater coil 13 at a temperature of 850 to 10000F and a pressure of 14.7 to 150 psia via line 17 and is supplied to reformer 18 at the desired superheated temperature and pressure. In another embodiment wherein a large portion of the heat for the endothermic reforming reaction passes through the tube wall, the reformer illustrated in Figure 3 having a multiplicity of tubes may be used. The superheated steam methanol gaseous mixture is reformed as it passes through a tube packed with a suitable catalyst not shown contained in reformer 18.The steam reforming catalyst is typically a metal or metal oxide supported on an inert ceramic material. For example, a suitable steam reforming catalyst is zinc oxide e.g about 30 to 65 by weight zinc chromium oxide about 5 to 35 by weight chromium or a zinc oxide about 5 to 20 by weight zinc copper oxide about 15 to 40 by weight copper combination supported on alumina about 15 to 50 by weight . It has been determined that steam reforming in accordance with the practice of the present invention is optimized and heating is accomplished more readily when the reformer tube is divided into two catalyst sections, i.e. a first section from the inlet to the reactor tube to an intermediate position in the reactor tube containing a catalyst which has relatively low activity but good resistance to high temperatures, such as zinc chromium oxides and a second section extending from the end of the first section to the outlet area of the reactor tube containing a high activity catalyst such as copper zinc oxides. Alternatively, the low activity, high tempera ure resistant catalyst may be used by itself. In order to accommodate the endothermicity of the reforming reaction, heat is provided to reformer 18 as the sensible heat contained in the superheated gases.Thus, when methanol vapors and steam contact a catalyst such as a combination of zinc oxide and copper oxide at 500 to 9000F at atmospheric or higher pressure, methanol in effect decomposes to carbon monoxide and hydrogen while the carbon monoxide and steam correspondingly react according to the well known water gas shift reaction to form carbon dioxide and hydrogen as set forth below CH3OH CO 2H2 Co H20 CO2 H2 so that the overall reaction taking place in reformer 18 is CH3OH H2O CO2 3H2 Thus, within reformer 18, methanol and steam react endothermically at high temperature to produce a gaseous product consisting primarily of steam, hydrogen and carbon dioxide which is recovered from reactor 18 and supplied via conduit 19 either to condenser means 20, wherein most of the water is removed from the gaseous hydrogen carbon dioxide mixture by cooling the gaseous mixture to condense the water or directly via line 19a to the fuel cell. Where condensing means are used, water exits condenser 20 via line 21 and a gaseous mixture of hydrogen and carbon dioxide exits condenser 20 via line 22 and in this state may be supplied for direct utilization at the fuel side or anode of a fuel cell.If desired, the hydrogen carbon dioxide mixture may be further fractionated, by means not shown, to recover separated quantities of hydrogen and carbon dioxide. The introduction of superheated steam and methanol of the preferred temperatures and compositions into the catalyst bed in the reforming system, illustrated inFigure 1, permits the reforming apparatus to be made more compact, at least substantially narrower and with fewer reaction tubes than an apparatus relying on a standard feed of water and methanol which would require a large number of reaction tubes for producing an equivalent reforming effect. For many applications, the reformer can, if desired, be constructed in the form of a single tube. In a typical hydrogen production process using the reforming system illustrated in Figure 1, methanol is passed with steam over a catalyst at pressure typically ranging from 14.7 to 150 psia and temperatures in the range of about 850 to about 10000F.Typical steam to methanol mole ratios H2 0 carbon are in the range of about 2.5 1 to about 4 1. The conversion of methanol may be effected in one pass over the catalyst bed contained in the reformer. Figure 1 as described above, schematically shows small scale equipment for carrying out the methanol steam reforming process of the present invention. The foregoing principles are readily applicable to the design of large scale equipment for the production of hydrogen in accordance with well known techniques. The system shown in Figure 1 for steam reforming methanol into hydrogen is particularly adapted for use in, and can be efficiently integrated with, a fuel cell system. Figures 2, 3, 4 and 5 illustrate an assembly integrating a steam reformer, combustor, superheater and fuel cell air preheater in one compact unit. As illustrated in Figure 2, cylindrical housing 100 and defines combustion chamber 102 mounted adjacent to shell 104 having central duct 106 passing therethrough. Hydrogen supply duct 101 and methanol supply duct 103 lead into combustion chamber 102 to provide fuel for vaporizing and superheating the methanol water mixture.Air preheater tube 107 passes through combustion chamber 102 below superheater coils 108 disposed within combustion chamber 102 and operably connected to methanol supply heater tube 1 10 passing through central duct 106 in shell 104. Methanol supply heater tube 110 exits into methanol inlet plenum 112 opening into reformer tubes 114 leading to hydrogen exhaust plenum 118 having hydrogen exhaust ports 120 operably connected thereto. As illustrated in Figures 3 and 4, air preheater 107 is disposed below methanol steamfeed superheater coils 108 in combustion chamber 102 and is operably connected to the cathode of the fuel cell not shown .In operation, a fuel air mixture such as hydrogen from the anode of a fuel cell is introduced into combustion chamber 102 through combustor inlet duct 101, the exhaust from combustion chamber 102 flows cocurrently along methanol supply heater tube 110 over reformer tubes 114, past baffles 128 and 130, then exits through combustor exhaust ports 132 and 134. Air for the cathode of the fuel cell enters air inlet port 136, passes through air preheater 107 situated in combustion chamber 102 and exits through air exhaust port 138. The methanol water mixture to be reformed enters through methanol inlet port 140, is superheated in superheater coils 108 located in combustion chamber 102, then is directed cocurrently upward with the combustion exhaust through methanol supply heater tube 110 into methanol inlet plenum 112, thence through reformer tubes 114 and exits through hydrogen exhaust plenum 118 and hydrogen exhaust ports 120. In figure 6, integrated heater reformer unit 201 is substantially the same as the integrated reformer unit illustrated in Figures 2 and 5 having combustion chamber 202 formed therein opening into central duct 206.Superheater coil 208 disposed within combustion chamber 202 is operably connected to methanol supply heater tube 210 disposed within central duct 206 and opens into methanol intake plenum 212 joined by reformer tubes 214 to hydrogen exhaust planum 218 having hydrogen exhaust line 220 connected thereto leading to condenser 241 and thence to anode 242 of fuel cell 244. Hydrogen contained in the exhaust from anode 242 of fuel cell 244 is removed by means not shown and is fed to combustion chamber 202 through line 280 and burner 227. Fuel cell coolant circulates through fuel cell 244 removing excess heat therefrom, line 248 conducts the fuel cell coolant to evaporator 250 which vaporizes the water methanol feed supplied to superheater 208 through line 252.Air preheater coil 224, disposed within combustion chamber 202, heats air entering through inlet 254 connected to line 256 then returns it to cathode chamber 258 of fuel cell 244 through heat exchanges 260 and means not shown.Heat exchanger 260 also serves to preheat combustion air passing through line 286 and burner 227. Methanol and water mix to be reformed into hydrogen and converted in fuel cell 244 is stored in tank 264 connected to evaporator 250 by line 265. Fuel cell coolant from evaporator 250 passes through line 266 to coolant tank 268 which stores coolant for use in the cooling system used to remove excess heat from fuel cell 244. During steady operation, excess heat is removed from the coolant in air cooler 271, bypassing start up furnace 276. Fuel for combustion chamber 202 leaves tank 264 through line 270 leading to combustor 202 through line 279. For start up, a portion of the fuel is passed through line 270 to line 274 leading to start up heater 276 while another portion passes to reformer combustion chamber 202 through line 279.Excess hydrogen contained in the exhaust from anode 242 was fed to combustion chamber 202 through line 280. Air for combustion chamber 202 is compressed by compressor 282 and passes to combustion chamber 202 through line 286. Air for start up heater 276 passes through line 286. While air for combustion of methanol passes through line 278, coolant circulating thrOugh start up heater 276 and line 262 raises fuel cell 244 to proper operating temperature upon start up. In steady operation, hydrogen produced in reformer tubes 214 is converted to electricity in fuel cell 244, exhaust hydrogen from anode 242 of fuel cell 244 is used to supply fuel value to combustion chamber 202, while heat rejected from fuel cell 244 is used to vaporize the methanol water feed. From the above description of suitable means for conducting the method of the present invention, it will be clear that various alternatives exist for maintaining the heat balance during the practice of the reforming process of the present invention when integrated with a phosphoric acid fuel cell system of the type hereinbefore described. The selection of a particular mode of operation will be dictated by overall process economics prevalent with any particular H2 air fuel cell system and the desire to maximize the production of gaseous hydrogen while operating under the most beneficial conditions of temperature and pressure. The following examples are offered for a better understanding of the reforming process of the present invention, but the invention is not to be construed as limited thereto. Example I A mixture of air and hydrogen was separately fed to a burner equipped with a heating coil of the type shown in Figure 1 of the drawings. In separate runs, a water methanol feedstock at molar feed ratios of 4.5 and 9.0 was preheated to a temperature of 9000F in a mineral oil heated vaporizer 11. The preheated water methanol feedstock was passed into heating coil 13 of burner 14 and superheated to 9000F. The water methanol feedstock exited the burner at 9000F and was passed into the inlet section of experimental subscale reformer 18 which consisted of a one inch diameter pipe with a one foot long catalyst bed consisting of 206 grams of a ZnO CuO combination catalyst on an alumina support.The composition of the catalyst of the type conventionally used for the water gas shift reaction comprised of 11.6 by weight Zn, 27.5 by weight Cu, and 29.98 by weight alumina. Reforming of the methanol in reformer 18 was accomplished at 14.7 psia and a constant weight hourly space velocity of 1.5 grams gm methanol feed gm catalyst hour. Steam reforming took place within the catalyst bed with the heat being provided directly thereto by the superheated gases flowing through reformer 18. In both runs, effluent samples collected from condenser 20 and analyzed for CO content using a gas chromatograph indicated that the carbon monoxide level was below the calibration range of the gas chromatograph 100 200 ppm . The methanol conversion for the 4.5 and 9.0 water molar feed ratios in the two runs was 84.6 and 96.2 respectively. The first order rate constants overall were 2.8 and 4.9 hr respectively. The projected weight hourly space velocities for the 4.5 and 9.0 water molar feed ratios in the two runs to yield 99.8 methanol conversion was calculated to be 0.45 and 0.789 gm methanol feed gm catalyst hour respectively. The temperature profile through the length of the reformer is shown in Table II below.

The first section extended six inches from the inlet of the 13 reactor tubes. The second catalyst section extended the remaining 18 inches of the tubes to the outlet. The first section contained a low activity, high temperature resistant catalyst consisting of 978.0 grams of a zinc chromium oxide catalyst composed of 55.0 by weight Zn, and 22.0 by weight chromium oxide. The second catalyst section contained 5884.0 grams of a high activity, low temperature catalyst consisting of ZnO CuO combination with an alumina support the catalyst comprised 11.6 by weight Zn, 27.5 by weight Cu, and 29.9 by weight alumina and was of the type conventionally used for the water gas shift reaction. The water methanol feedstock molar ratio was 2.0. Effluent samples collected from condenser 20 and analyzed for CO level indicated a concentration varying from 0.5 to 2.0 weight percent. The methanol conversion was 99.5 . The first order rate constant was 2.44 gm methanol feed gm catalyst hour. The weight hourly space velocity was 0.46 gm methanol feed gm catalyst hour. The temperature profile through the length of the reformer is shown in Table IV below. This illustrates the effect of the upper, high temperature catalyst section in protecting the lower, low temperature catalyst from the high inlet temperatures necessary to complete the reaction with an optimally sized reactor.

Five thousand five hundred 5500 ml hr of the superheated mixture was passed through reformer tubes containing 6290 cc of a zinc oxide copper oxide alumina catalyst comprising 11.6 wt. zinc, 27.5 wt. copper and 29.2 wt. alumina, having a specific gravity of 6050 g and a bulk density of 0.92 gm cc. The space velocity within the reformer was 1 therefore 0.469 hr 1 on a mass basis g hr of methanol g of catalyst or 985 her 1 on the basis of volumes of H2 in the feed per hour catalyst volume.The reaction tubes were disposed within a shell heated by 14,000 g hr of flue gases entering the shell at 8900F and leaving at 5470F yielding an average rate of heat input to the reformer of 5200 kcal hr. The average catalyst bed temperature was 535OF, and the temperature of the reactants leaving the reformer was 5650F. The conversion of methanol was essentially completely converted yielding 8,185 1. of gas at STP per hour having a composition of 73.4 mole H2, 24.0 mole CO2 and 2.6 mole CO.
