# PLUGGING WELLBORES WITH POLYACRYLIC ACID SHEAR THICKENING COMPOSITION

## Abstract
A process for plugging a porous formation in a well bore which comprises pumping a shear thickening composition into drill pipe in the well under conditions of low shear to the point desired to be plugged at which point the composition is forced through the orifices of a drill bit at the end of the drill pipe and subjected to high shear of at least about 1,000 sec. ยน which forms a paste in the well bore which plugs the porous formation. The shear thickening composition com prises a water in oil emulsion having granular bentonite dispersed in the continuous oily phase, wherein the oily phase has a polyamine derivative surfactant dissolved therein, and the aqueous phase comprises an aqueous solution of a polyacrylamide and polyacrylic acid. This process may be used for plugging wells having depths in excess of 8,000 feet.
