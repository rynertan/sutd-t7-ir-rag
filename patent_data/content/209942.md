## Description
The invention relates to a low pressure mercury vapour discharge lamp, whose emission mainly lies in three spectral ranges and of which the colour tempera ture of the emitted light lies in the range of 2000 3000 K, this lamp being provided with a gas tight discharge envelope transparent to radiation and having a gas filling comprising mercury and a rare gas and with a luminescent layer comprising luminescent materials whose emission mainly lies in the range of 590 630 nm and in the range of 520 565 nm, whilst further means are provided for maintaining a column discharge in the gas filling, the power consumed by the column being at least 500 W m² surface area of the luminescent layer. Low pressure mercury vapour discharge lamps, whose emission mainly lies in three spectral ranges, also designated as three band fluorescent lamps, are known from USP 4,176,294 PHA 22,214 and from Netherlands Patent Specification 164,697 PHN 7137 . These lamps are commonly used in general illumination and have the advantage that they have both a good general colour rendition colour rendition index R a,8 of at least 80 and a high luminous efficacy up to values of 90 lm W and higher . This is possible because the emission of these lamps is mainly concentrated in three comparatively narrow spectral bands. For this purpose the lamps contain a red luminescing material whose emission mainly lies in the range of 590 630 nm and a green luminescing material whose emission mainly lies in the range of 520 565 nm. The required emission in the third spectral range, A desired colour temperature of the light emit ted by a three band fluorescent lamp is obtained by a suitable adjustment of relative contributions in the three spectral ranges to the overall emission of the lamp. As the colour temperature of the lamp is lower, the contri bution in the blue range of 430 490 nm should be smaller. It follows from the aforementioned Netherland Patent Specification 164,697 that the minimum attainable colour temperature for lamps having an inner diameter of the tubular discharge envelope of about 36 mm is about 2300 K, in which event the lamp need no longer contain a blue luminescing material and all the required radiation in the blue spectral range originates from the blue mercury radiation. In lamps having a smaller inner diameter of the discharge envelope, especially a diameter of about 24 mm, the mercury vapour discharge is found to be more effieient the relative contribution of the blue mercury line being larger. Consequently for these lamps, the minimum attainable colour temperature is found to have a higher value, Three band fluorescent lamps of the kind mentioned in the opening paragraph are known, for example, from US Patent Specifications 4,335,330 PHN 8875 , 4,199,708 PHN 8877 and 4,374,340 PHN 9408 and are generally of very compact construction and intended to replace incandescent lamps. Due to their compact construc tion, the luminescent layer in these lamps is heavily loaded, that is to say that the power consumed by the column during operation of the lamp is at least 500 W per m² surface area of the luminescent layer. This is considerably higher than the load of the luminescent lamp layer in the aforementioned lamps having an inner diameter of about 36 and 24 mm, respectively, which load has a value of the order of 300 and 400 W m², respectively. It has been found that in these heavily loaded lamps the relative contribution of the blue mercury radiation is even higher and that such lamps, if the use of a blue luminescing material is abandoned, have at least a colour temperature of the emitted light of about 2700 K at colour points lying on the line of the black body radiators. As a result and also due to their high R a,8 , these lamps are suitable to replace incandescent lamps. Hitherto, for interior illumination use is mainly made of incandescent lamps. A typical value of the colour temperature of an incandescent lamp is 2650 K. How ever, by the use of colour lamps for example the so called flame lamps and also by the use of dimmers, in the interior illumination colour temperatures occur of down to about 2000 K. With a view to saving of energy, it is often desirable to replace incandescent lamps by fluorescent lamps. A disadvantage of the aforementioned heavily loaded fluorescent lamps is that due to the intense blue mercury radiation they cannot be used in the frequently desired colour temperature range of about 2000 to about 2700 K. The invention has for its object to obviate the said disadvantage and in general to provide means for shifting the colour point of heavily loaded three band fluorescent lamps and for reducing the colour tempera ture, the good general colour rendition being maintained, and the high relative luminous flux being substantially maintained. A low pressure mercury vapour discharge lamp of the kind described in the opening paragraph is characterized according to the invention in that the lamp is provided with an absorption layer comprising an aluminate activated by trivalent cerium and having a garnet crystal structure. The said garnet is a known luminescent material of for example J.O.S.A., A lamp according to the invention is preferred which is characterized in that the luminescent aluminate having a garnet structure corresponds to the formula Ln Preferably, such a lamp according to the invention is characterized in that in the garnet Ln is yttrium and in that the garnet does not contain Ga and Sc p q 0 . Such materials in fact have the most favourable absorption properties and supply the highest luminous fluxes. In an embodiment of a lamp according to the invention, the absorption layer is disposed on the outer surface of the discharge envelope. This has the advantage that the mercury resonance radiation produced in the lamp is utilized to the optimum and the absorption layer only absorbs the undesired blue radiation and converts it into visible radiation. In general, such a lamp will be provided with a protection, for example an outer bulb, or will be used in a closed luminaire. A next embodiment of a lamp according to the invention is characterized in that the absorption layer is disposed on the inner surface of the discharge envelope and in that the luminescent layer is disposed on the side of the absorption layer facing the discharge. Also in this lamp, the mercury resonance radiation will mainly be absorbed by the luminescent layer and will be converted to the optimum into light. The use of an outer bulb or a closed luminaire is not necessary for this lamp. An advantageous embodiment of a lamp according to the invention is characterized in that the garnet activated by trivalent cerium is mixed with the luminescent materials of the luminescent layer and in that the luminescent layer is at the same time the absorption layer. Such a lamp can in fact be manufactured in a simple manner because the absorption layer and the luminescent layer can be introduced into the lamp in a single operation. A particularly advantageous embodiment of a lamp according to the invention, which is capped on one side and is provided with a ballast unit and an ignition unit, which are provided together with the discharge envelope in a common envelope consisting of a bottom portion comprising the cap and an outer bulb transparent to radiation, and may be provided with reflectors arranged within the envelope, is characterized in that the absorption layer is disposed on at least parts of the surface of the ballast unit and or ignition unit and or of the bottom portion and or the reflectors.

The discharge bulb 5 comprises a glass tube having an inner diameter of 9.5 mm, this tube being bent into the shape of a hook comprising four adjacent parallel extending tube portions interconnected by three curved tube portions. The discharge bulb 5 contains a small quantity of mercury and an amalgam and a mixture of argon and neon at a pressure of 300 Pa. Electrodes 7 and 8, respectively, are arranged at the ends of the bulb 5 and the inner surface of the bulb 5 is provided with a luminescent layer 9 comprising red and green luminescing materials as mentioned in Fig. 1. The bulb 5 is arranged with its free ends in a bottom plate 10, which is secured in the bottom portion 3. The bottom plate 10 and the ballast unit 6 are coated with a thin absorption layer 11 and 12, respectively, of cerium activated yttrium aluminate. The lamp consumes during operation a power of 18 W. The length of the curved discharge path is about 390 mm and the power consumed by the column divided by the surface area of the luminescent layer 9 has a value of 125 W m². Four lamps of the type described with reference to Fig. 1 9 W were provided with a thin uniform absorption layer of cerium activated garnet according to the formula Y₂.₉Ce₀.₁Al₅O₁₂, which layer was disposed on the outer surface of the discharge bulb. For each lamp a different layer thickness was used. In the following table, the overall mass of the garnet used in the absorption layer A in mg , the colour point x,y of the light emitted by the lamp and the luminous flux obtained L in lumen were indicated for eachof these lamps. For comparison, under ª the values measured on a lamp without an absorption layer, but otherwise identical to the lamps 1 4, are also indicated. Three lamps of the kind shown in Fig. 1 9 W , but without an outer absorption layer, were coated on the inner side of the discharge bulb with an absorption layer of cerium activated garnet according to the formula Y₂.₉Ce₀.₁Al₅O₁₂. On this absorption layer, a luminescent layer consisting of a mixture of red luminescing Y₂O₃ Eu³ and green luminescing CeMgAl₁₁O₁₉ Tb is provided. In the following table, for each lamp the thickness of the absorption layer A overall mass of the layer in mg , the colour point x, y , the value of the general colour rendition index R a,8 , the luminous flux at 0 hours L₀ in lm and the luminous flux after 1000 operating hours L₁₀₀₀ in lm are indicated.

A lamp of the kind described with reference to Fig. 2 18 W was provided with a Y₂.₉Ce₀.₁ Al₅O₁₂ containing absorption layer disposed on the bottom plate on the ballast unit and on the side of the up right edge of the bottom portion facing the discharge bulb. The lamp had a colour point of the emitted radiation x 0.465 and y 0.417, which is very close to the desired point x 0.468 and y 0.418 . An identical lamp, but without an absorption layer, had a colour point x 0.461 and y 0.412. Three lamps of the kind described with reference to Fig. 2 18 W were provided with a lumines cent layer consisting of a mixture of green luminescing terbium activated cerium magnesium aluminate CAT , red luminescing yttrium oxide activated by trivalent europium YOX and cerium activated garnet YAG according to the formula Y₂.₉Ce₀.₁Al₅O₁₂. In these lamps, the luminescent layer therefore also fulfilled the function of absorption layer. In the following Table, for these lamps the composition of the luminescent layer in by weight is given, while the results of measurements of the colour point x, y , the colour temperature T Finally, it should be noted that the lumines cent layer of a lamp according to the invention may comprise besides a red luminescing and a green luminescing material also a small quantity of a blue luminescing material, as is also the case in three band fluorescent lamps having a high colour temperature. In the present heavily loaded lamps, this can afford advantages because the blue luminescing material provides an additio nal degree of freedom for reaching a desired value of the colour point of the lamp.
