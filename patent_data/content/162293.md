# An apparatus for measuring the quantity of airflow passing through an intake passage of an engine.

## Abstract
Disposed in a intake pipe 13 of an engine is a temper ature sensitive element 17 formed of a resistance element whose resistance value varies with temperature. A heating current is supplied to the temperature sensitive element 17 through a transistor 37 . The voltage of the heating current is set by a constant voltage circuit 38, 49 . The temperature of the temperature sensitive element 17 is compared with a reference temperature of an auxiliary temperature sensitive element 30 . When the temperature of the temperature sen sitive element 17 is increased to a predetermined level, an output signal is delivered from a comparator 33 . A flip flop circuit 34 is reset by the output signal from the comparator 33 , and is set by a start pulse signal. When the flip flop circuit 34 is set, the transistor 37 is turned on, allowing the heating current to be supplied to the temperature sen sitive element 17 . A burning off instruction signal is sup plied to a monostable multivibrator 42 , and a signal with a duration suited for the burning off operation is delivered from an AND circuit 43 . In response to the output signal from the AND circuit 43 , the flip flop circuit 34 is held set, and a reference voltage supplied to the differential amplifier 39 is changed to a low level.
