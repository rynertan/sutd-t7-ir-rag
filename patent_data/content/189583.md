## Description
Aromatic carbonate polymers are well known thermoplastic materials which, due to their many advantageous properties, find use as thermoplastic engineering materials. The aromatic carbonate polymers exhibit, for example, excellent properties of toughness, impact resistance, heat resistance and dimensional stability. Not only are molded parts prepared from aromatic carbonate polymers, but films and sheet materials as well. Because of its excellent property spectrum, aromatic carbonate polymers such as aromatic polycarbonate have been proposed for various utilities including those relating to medical packaging, for example the containers in which syringes, surgical instruments, intravenous fluids, operating room devices, and the like are maintained. Additionally polycarbonate has been used in medical devices such as blood oxygenators, anesthesia canisters, intravenous connectors and accessories, blood centrifuge bowls, surgical instruments and operating room instruments. The toughness of the polycarbonate as well as its clarity, high heat resistance, strength and good blood compatibility make it a potential substance of choice in this high technology medical device and packaging market. Sterilization of these articles used in the medical arts and other technologies is often times required. However, one particular difficulty with certain sterilization techniques has been discovered. A typical method of sterilizing various objects useful in medical practice is through irradiation. The type of radiation usually employed is low level gamma radiation. It is readily apparent that the level of gamma radiation which accomplishes the sterilization is significantly above that of ordinary background radiation. When exposed to radiation which is of sufficient strength and duration to sterilize various objects, the aromatic carbonate polymeric material is subject to yellowing. This yellowing changes the color of the aromatic carbonate, thus reducing its utility for this particular application. Not only packaging materials such as flexible aromatic carbonate film and sheet products but also molded parts as well suffer from this yellowing phenomenon. A new family of additives has been discovered which inhibits the yellowing of aromatic carbonate polymers after exposure to sterilization irradiation. By sterilization irradiation is meant irradiation which kills microorganisms. In accordance with the invention there is provided a method for reducing yellowing of an irradiated aromatic carbonate polymer which comprises irradiated a composition comprising an aromatic carbonate polymer and 0.01 to 2 weight percent based on the aromatic carbonate polymer of an anti yellowing upon exposure to sterilization irradiation triethanolamine borate or boron compound wherein there is at least one present in the boron compound, R and R being defined in claim 1. A further aspect of the invention the boron compound is of the formula The symbols R and R are defined further in the specification. Aromatic carbonate polymer generally includes both the polycarbonates and the copolyestercarbonates. The aromatic polycarbonate resins for use herein can be prepared by reacting a dihydric phenol with a carbonate precursor, such as phosgene, a haloformate or a carbonate ester. Generally speaking, such carbonate polymers may be typified as possessing recurring structural units of the formula wherein A is a divalent aromatic radical of the dihydric phenol employed in the polymer producing reaction. Preferably, the carbonate polymers used to provide the resinous mixtures of the invention have an intrinsic viscosity as measured in methylene chloride at 25 C ranging from 0.30 to 1.00 dl g. The dihydric phenols which may be employed to provide such aromatic carbonate polymers are mononuclear or polynuclear aromatic compounds, containing as functional groups two hydroxy radicals, each of which is attached directly to a carbon atom of an aromatic nucleus. Typical dihydric phenols are Other dihydric phenols which are also suitable for use in the preparation of the above polycarbonates are disclosed in U.S A 2,999,835 3,028,365 3,334,154 and 4,131,575.

It is possible to employ two or more different dihydric phenols or a copolymer of a dihydric phenol with a glycol or with a hydroxy or acid terminated polyester or with a dibasic acid in the event a carbonate copolymer or interpolymer rather than a homopolymer is desired for use in the preparation of the polycarbonate mixtures of the invention. Branched polycarbonates are also useful, such as are described in U.S A 4,001,184, also there can be utilized blends of a linear polycarbonate and a branched polycarbonate. Moreover, blends of any of the above materials may be employed in the practice of this invention to provide the aromatic polycarbonate. In any event, the preferred aromatic carbonate polymer for use as component a i herein is a homopolymer derived from 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propane bisphenol A . The copolyestercarbonate usually employed may generally be described as polymers comprising recurring carbonate groups, The dihydric phenols useful in formulating the copolyestercarbonates for use herein may be represented by the general formula in which A is an aromatic group such as phenylene, biphenylene, naphthylene, anthrylene, etc. E may be an alkylene or alkylidene group such as methylene, ethylene, propylene, propylidene, isopropylidene, butylene, butylidene, isobutylidene, amylene, isoamylene, amylidene, isoamylidine and generally from one to twelve carbon atoms, inclusive, etc. Where E is an alkylene or alkylidene group, it may also consist of two or more alkylene or alkylidene groups, connected by a nonalkylene or non alkylidene group such as an aromatic linkage, a tertiary amino linkage, an ether linkage, a carbonyl linkage, a silicon containing linkage, or by a sulfur containing linkage such as sulfide, sulfoxide, sulfone, etc. In addition, E may be a cycloaliphatic group of five to seven carbon atoms, inclusive e.g. cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl , or a cycloalkylidene of five to seven carbon atoms inclusive, such as cyclohexylidene, a sulfur containing linkage, such as sulfide, sulfoxide or sulfone an ether linkage a carbonyl group a tertiary nitrogen group, or a silicon containing linkage such as silane or siloxy.

Where s is zero in Formula II and u is not zero, the aromatic rings are directly joined with no intervening alkylene or other bridge. The positions of the hydroxyl groups and Y on the aromatic nuclear residues A can be varied in the ortho, meta, or para positions and the groupings can be in a vicinal, asymmetrical or symmetrical relationship, where two or more ring carbon atoms of the aromatic hydrocarbon residue are substituted with Y and hydroxyl group. Examples of dihydric phenol compounds that may be employed in the copolyestercarbonate include Also useful are dihydric phenols wherein E is a sulfur containing radical such as the dihydroxy aryl sulfones exemplified by bis 4 hydroxyphenyl sulfone 2,4 dihydroxydiphenyl sulfone 5 chloro 2,4 dihydroxy diphenyl sulfone 3 chloro bis 4 hydroxyphenyl sulfone and 4,4 dihydroxytriphenyldisulfone etc. The preparation of these and other useful sulfones are described in U.S A 2,288,282. Polysulfones as well as substituted sulfones using halogen, nitrogen, alkyl radicals, etc. are also useful. Dihydroxy aromatic ethers such as those described in U.S A 3,148,172 are useful as the dihydric phenol herein. The dihydroxy aromatic ethers may be prepared as described in U.S A 2,739,171.

In general, any difunctional carboxylic acid or its reactive derivative such as the acid halide conventionally used in the preparation of polyesters may be used for the preparation of polyestercarbonates useful in formulating the compositions of the present invention. In general, the carboxylic acids which may be used include the aliphatic carboxylic acids, aliphatic aromatic carboxylic acids, or aromatic carboxylic acids. The aromatic dicarboxylic acids or their reactive derivatives such as the aromatic diacid halides are preferred as they produce the aromatic polyestercarbonates which are most useful, from the standpoint of physical properties, in the practice of the instant invention. These carboxylic acids may be represented by the general formula wherein R¹ represents an alkylene, alkylidene or cycloaliphatic group in the same manner as set out above for E in Formula II an alkylene, alkylidene or cycloaliphatic group containing ethylenic unsaturation an aromatic radical such as phenylene, naphthylene, bisphenylene, substituted phenylene, etc. two or more aromatic groups connected through non aromatic linkages such as those defined by E in Formula II or a divalent aliphatic aromatic hydrocarbon radical such as an aralkyl or alkaryl radical. R² is either a carboxyl or a hydroxyl group. The letter q represents the integer one where R² is a hydroxyl group and either zero or one where R² is a carboxyl group. Thus the difunctional carboxylic acid will either be a monohydroxy monocarboxylic acid or a dicarboxylic acid. For purposes of the present invention the aromatic dicarboxylic acids or their reactive derivatives such as, for example, the acid halides, are preferred. Thus in these preferred aromatic dicarboxylic acids, as represented by Formula II, R² is a carboxyl group and R¹ is an aromatic radical such as phenylene, biphenylene, naphthylene, substituted phenylene, etc., two or more aromatic groups connected through non aromatic linkages or a divalent aliphatic aromatic radical.

The aromatics may be substituted with Y groups in the same manner as the formula I aromatics are substituted. These acids may be used individually or as mixtures of two or more different acids. The carbonate precursor may be either a carbonyl halide, a carbonate ester, or a haloformate. The carbonyl halides which can be employed herein are carbonyl chlorides and carbonyl bromide.

The copolyestercarbonates which are preferred in the practice of the present invention include the aromatic polyestercarbonates derived from dihydric phenols, aromatic dicarboxylic acids or their reactive ester forming derivatives such as the aromatic diacid halides, and phosgene. A particularly useful class of aromatic copolyestercarbonates is that derived from bisphenol A, isophthalic acid, terephthalic acid, or a mixture of isophthalic acid and terephthalic acid, or the reactive derivatives of these acids such as terephthaloyl dichloride, isophthaloyl dichloride, or a mixture of isophthaloyl dichloride and terephthaloyl dichloride, and phosgene. The molar proportion of ester units in the copolyestercarbonate is generally from 25 to 90 mole percent and preferably 35 to 80 mole percent.

When the R is connected to a second oxygen group as in a biborate, the R becomes divalent, that is, for example, alkylene instead of alkyl, phenylene instead of phenyl, cycloalkylene instead of cycloalkyl, and the like, and is designated by R . Examples of such boron compounds with an R group include generally known as a boroxine wherein each R is the same or different. The above organoboron compounds are prepared by methods known in the art, see Lappert in Chemical Reviews, 56, pp. 959 1064 1956 . Also of significant interest and a preferred substructure are the biborates utilizing the divalent radial wherein R is the same or different. The biborates of Figure VII are prepared by methods known in the art, for example, see Kirk Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, When using R , as in the biborates, the divalent radical is the same as R only a further hydrogen atom is missing, as aforementioned. Examples of such R are alkylene instead of alkyl, cycloalkylene instead of cycloalkyl, alkenylene instead of alkenyl, arylene instead of aryl and the like.

The admixtures of the aromatic carbonate polymer are simply prepared by standard techniques, for example dry mixing and melt extruding at an elevated temperature. The extruded admixture is then molded into a piece of specific dimensions or further extruded into a film or sheet product. Various other additives may be employed in their appropriate quantities if they do not substantially detract from the final application. For example, the composition can be thermally stabilized by a phosphite, hydrolytically stabilized by an epoxide or flame retarded with a salt or brominated polymer. The boron compounds can be effectively added to aromatic carbonate polymers blended with other polymers as well. Illustrative of these polymer types include acrylates, polyolefins, EDPM type polymers, styrenics, butadiene, amorphous copolyester and the like. The amorphous copolyester is preferred and is prepared from 1,4 cyclohexanedimethanol and aromatic diacids or diacid ester, usually of the isophthalic acid family, the terephthalic acid family or mixtures of the isophthalic acid and terephthalic acid. Amorphous copolyesters with reaction residues of 1,4 cyclohexanedimethanol and a mixture of terephthalic and isophthalic acid are marketed under the trademark Kodar A150 by Eastman. The glycol portion of this type of copolymer need not only be made up of 1,4 cyclohexanedimethanol residues but may contain residues of other glycols, usually alkylene glycols having two to ten carbon atoms, preferably two to four carbon atoms, more preferably two carbon atoms, i.e. ethylene. Generally the molar ratio of the 1,4 cyclohexanedimethanol to ethylene glycol in the glycol portion is from about 4 1 to 1 4, with an acid portion comprising terephthalic acid, or isophthalic acid or mixtures of both acids. The copolyester component may be prepared by procedures well known to those skilled in this art, such as by condensation reactions substantially as shown and described in US A 2,901,466. The copolyesters for use in the subject invention generally will have an internal viscosity of at least about 0.4 dl gm as measured in 60 40 phenol tetrachloroethane or other similar solvent at about 25 C. and will have a heat distortion temperature of from about 60 C. to 70 C. The relative amounts of the 1,4 cyclohexanedimethanol to ethylene glycol in the glycol portion may vary so long as the molar ratio of 1,4 cyclohexanedimethanol to ethylene glycol is from 1 4 to 4 1. A preferred copolyester for use as the amorphous polyester copolymer blend component in the subject invention is a copolyester as described above wherein the glycol portion has a predominance of ethylene glycol over 1,4 cyclohexanedimethanol, for example greater than 50 50 and especially preferably is about 70 molar ethylene glycol to 30 molar 1,4 cyclohexanedimethanol and the acid portion is terephthalic acid. A preferred copolyester of this type is commercially available under the tradename KODAR PETG 6763 from Eastman Chemical Company. A further preferred copolyester is where the 1,4 cyclohexanedimethanol is predominant molar wise over the ethylene glycol. A copolyester of this type is commercially available from Eastman Chemical under the tradename KODAR PCTG. The radiation employed to achieve sterilization of the particular object is ionizing radiation, usually gamma radiation. The quantity of gamma radiation depends upon various factors such as thickness of the irradiated article and the like but is generally 0.5 to about 7 Megarads. Preferably, the irradiation is from about 1.0 to 3.0 Megarads. The amount of boron compound necessary to achieve an anti yellowing effect upon sterilization irradiation of the aromatic carbonate polymer admixture is from 0.01 to 2.0 weight percent of the boron compound is used as measured by the aromatic carbonate polymer. A more specific range is from 0.2 to 1.5 weight percent. A preferred range is from 0.3 to 1.0 weight percent. The exact quantity of a specific boron compound depends upon its specific activity and the nature of the aromatic carbonate polymer article in which it is admixed. As stated previously, this method can be used to successfully inhibit irradiation yellowing of aromatic carbonate polymers in a variety of structures, for example, packaging containers for the irradiated medical materials and polycarbonate containing medical devices such as blood oxgenators, anesthesia canisters, blood centrifuge bowls and the like.
