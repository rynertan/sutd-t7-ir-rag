# POLYMER POLYOLS, METHODS FOR MAKING SAME AND POLYURETHANES BASED THEREON

## Abstract
This invention relates to normally liquid, stable polymer polyol compositions formed by polymerizing, in the pre sence of a free radical catalyst, an ethylenically unsaturated monomer or monomers dissolved or dispersed in a polyol mixture including a coupled polyol consisting of the reaction product of a polyol having a functionality in excess of 2 reacted with a polyisocyanate in such proportion that the ratio of hydroxyl groups to isocyanato groups is greater than 1. In one embodiment, the coupled polyol is made in situ in the base polyol by addition thereto of the required amount of the polyisocyanate. The novel polymer polyol compositions are convertible to polyurethane foams and elastomers.
