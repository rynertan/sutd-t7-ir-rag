# Speed control mechanism for a hydrostatically driven vehicle.

## Abstract
A speed control mechanism for a hydrostatically driven vehicle such as a street sweeper is disclosed which in cludes a selector lever 60 . When the lever 60 is in a variable engine speed position, depression of an accel erator pedal 106 progressively opens the engine throttle 164 from idle speed to high engine speed and progressive ly closes an inching valve 11 thereby enabling the operator to comfortably drive the vehicle through stop and go traffic. When the lever 60 is in a governor controlled high speed position, the engine throttle 164 is opened and the engine is driven at high speed under control of the governor.,and progressive depression of the throttle 106 progressively closes the inching valve 11 thereby providing optimum power while the vehicle is working, such as sweeping streets, with the speed of the vehicle being controlled by position of the throttle and the position of the inching valve.
