# CONTROL AND COMMAND SYSTEM TO DISPLACE A CHAIN WHOSE LINKS ARE INTO GEAR WITH A COG WHEEL

## Abstract
A control and command system for the displacement of a chain whose links are into gear with a cog wheel, constituted of an electronic system comprising a switching power supply unit 1 , two pulse shapers 9 , of the Schmitt trigger type, a microprocessor 10 composed of a central processing unit CPU , a random access memory RAM and a read only memory ROM , two binary coded microchop pers, an emergency STOP switch 7 , a keyboard 13 ,a liquid crystal display 12 with the necessary elements for its functioning, an auxiliary light indicator and power drivers 4 responsible of transfering the orders from the microproces sor to the relays, which are connected to a manual selector HEAVE IN LET GO which gives the command signals to the external control circuits of the actuation motor, depending on the manual functioning or automatic functioning by computer.
