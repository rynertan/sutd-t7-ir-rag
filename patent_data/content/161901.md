## Description
It is well established that mononuclear phagocytes are required for antigen recognition and lymphocyte activation, and that they play a vital role in the immune response of the host to infectious, inflammatory and malignant disease. Several aspects of immunological function and host response to infection and injury are attributable to various proteins and other mediators released from stimulated mononuclear phagocytes Dinarello, C.A. The subject invention concerns a nucleic acid comprising a nucleotide sequence coding for human IL 1, and fragments thereof, and to the polypeptides and peptides obtained. Specifically, the subject invention comprises the cloning of a cDNA synthesized by reverse transcription of poly A RNA isolated from adherent human monocytes stimulated with bacterial endotoxin. Injection of hybrid selected poly A RNA into Monocytes were separated from lymphocytes in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells by using adherence to glass surfaces. The adherent monolayers 80 90 monocytes, as judged by microscopic examination of phagocytized staphylococcal particles were stimulated with endotoxin. Total cellular nucleic acid was extracted from the adherent cell population, purified by centrifugation through CsCl Chirgwin, J.M., Przybyla, A.E., MacDonald, R.J., and Rutter, W.J. Aliquots of poly A RNA were assayed for protein synthesis by Several poly A RNA preparations extracted from 12 h endotoxin stimulated monocytes were pooled and fractionated by sucrose gradient sedimentation. Each fraction was precipated with ethanol, translated in a reticulocyte lysate, and analyzed by immunoprecipitation and electrophoresis as described above. RNA from selected fractions was also injected into oocytes. The culture medium from each batch of 20 oocytes was passed over Sephacryl S 200 and the eluted fractions were assayed for LAF activity as described above. It is clear that the majority of the activity clusters around the fractions containing the 35 K band centering on fraction 13 . A cDNA library was prepared from endotoxin stimulated monocyte poly A RNA using the technique and vector described by Okayama and Berg The cDNAs were used to produce hybrid selected RNA Maniatis, T., Fritsch, E.F., and Sambrook, J. Clone pA 26 possessed the highest efficiency for hybrid selection of the target RNA and similarly was associated with the strongest hybridization affinity for the cDNA probes that were used for screening. The cDNA transcript contained in pA 26 was sequenced as shown in the drawing and found to be approximately 920 base pairs in length. The single longest open reading frame for this sequence coded for a protein of 6,800 molecular weight. Since this did not correspond to the molecular size expected on the basis of the protein found in the reticulocyte translation, it was concluded that the cDNA transcript was not full length. Moreover, when nick translated pA 26 plasmid DNA was hybridized to a Northern Blot Rave, N. et al. The 4 h clone pcD 415 hybridizes to an RNA preparation which has IL 1 like LAF biological activity when injected into From the above, we concluded that the three structurally related clones pA 26, pcD 415, and pcD 1218 contain cDNA for human,monocyte IL 1. These clones were sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination technique following subcloning in various bacteriophage M13 cloning vectors. The drawing is a schematic summary of the strategy used for sequence determination. The top scale indicates the nucleotide positions relative to position 1 of the sequence as detailed in CHART A. The line immediately below the scale represents the extent of the sequence. The bold portion of the line delineates the predicted coding region for the IL 1 precursor. Restriction sites utilized in the sequencing procedure are indicated open circles Hae III and closed circles Alu I . The arrows beneath each cDNA clone indicate the direction and extent of gel sequences read from the M13 subclones Messing, J. and Vieira, J. The consensus nucleotide sequence of human monocyte Il 1 cDNA and the predicted amino acid sequence of the protein is shown in CHART A. The apparent coding region corresponds to a molecular weight of 30,747 and is similar in size to the protein translated in reticulocyte lysates, described previously. Nucleotides are numbered with position 1 corresponding to the first nucleotide following the G tails resulting from cloning with the Okayama Berg system. Boxed nucleotides represent a potential glycosylation site Rubinstein, M., As disclosed above, our criteria for IL 1 identification are stringent, relying on data both from immunoprecipitation and biological assay of The cDNA nucleotide sequence suggests that the initial translation product is larger than the protein usually associated with IL 1 activity. We suggest, therefore, that a proteolytic cascade processes IL 1 following synthesis and or release from stimulated monocytes. Throughout this proteolysis the molecule remains biologically active. Data derived from Clone plasmid pcD 415, which contains the cDNA for human monocyte IL 1 was deposited in an Recombinant plasmid pcD 415 can be isolated from its Also, it is within the skill of those in the art to vary the conditions disclosed herein for cloning the nucleotide sequence coding for human IL 1. The cloned human IL 1 gene can be used to detect related DNAs in the human genome by well known probe techniques. Further, unlimited amounts of nucleic acid comprising a nucleotide sequence coding human IL 1 can be made by the cloned human IL 1 gene of the subject invention. Still further, the IL 1 produced by the cloned gene of the subject invention can be used to induce the production of IL 2 by activating T cells IL 2 stimulates the T cells to proliferate. As reported in Another aspect of IL 1 is its inflammatory properties IL 1 has been isolated from the synovial fluid of patients with various forms of arthritis Wood, D.D., Ihrie, E.J., Dinarello, C.A., Cohen, P.L. Because of its central role as a mediator of host immunological and defense functions, detection of IL 1 in different disease states is likely to shed light on certain pathological processes, and levels of IL 1 may indicate the severity of certain disease states where this is masked by special drugs. There is evidence that IL 1 production is reduced in human subjects with certain cancers Hofmann, M.K., Pollack, S. IN Use of IL 1 as an immunological reagent in humans or animals is likely because of its ability to stimulate T and B cells and increase immunoglobulin synthesis. In fact, IL 1 appears to be an excellent candidate for the body s endogenous adjuvant. Thus, it is possible to use IL 1 or parts of the IL 1 molecule in certain immunogens. The subject invention, also, advantageously, provides novel biologically active human IL 1 proteins through use of novel truncated human IL 1 cDNA sequences. As disclosed above the entire human IL 1 cDNA sequence is shown in CHART A. This sequence is the starting material for the preparation of the novel clones containing novel truncated IL 1 cDNA sequences. Unlimited amounts of nucleic acid comprising nucleotide sequences coding for truncated human IL 1 can be made by the cloned human IL 1 cDNA of the subject invention. Further, the novel biologically active human IL 1 proteins obtained via the cloned truncated human IL 1 cDNA sequences of the subject invention can be used in the same manner as native human IL 1, disclosed above. The following examples are illustrative of the process and products of the subject invention but are not to be construed as limiting. All percentages are by weight and all solvent mixture proportions are by volume unless otherwise noted. Human mononuclear cells 4 6 x 10⁹ were isolated from Ficoll Hypaque gradient separation of plateletphoresis by products. Cells were washed 4 x in 0.9 NaCl at 600 X g to remove platelets. Monocytes were plated into flat glass bottles in RPMI Gibco containing 1 v v heat inactivated human AB serum at a density of 1.25 x 10⁶ cells cm² and allowed to adhere for 1.5 h at 37 . The bottles were then vigorously shaken and the non adherent population drained and counted. The total number of adherent monocytes was determined by subtracting the non adhering cells from the total cell count. Replacement serum free RPMI contained 300 ng ml Rabbit reticulocyte lysate was prepared, optimized and treated with micrococcal nuclease as described in Pelham, H.R.B. and Jackson, R.J. The sucrose gradient procedure is a modification of that described by Bleackley et al. Oocytes were processed as disclosed in Example 3, except that incubation was for 20 h and oocytes were incubated in microtiter plate wells at a density of 5 oocytes per well in 50 µl Barth X media. LAF activity was assayed using a modification of the procedure described by Rosenwasser and Dinarello Three separate cDNA libraries were used to isolate the three cDNA clones shown in the drawing.The first, represented by clone pA 26, was constructed from 12h endotoxin stimulated monocyte message using the original Okayama Berg cloning vector system The IL 1 cDNA sequence Chart A contains three unique restriction endonuclease digestion sites that can be used to construct plasmids containing specific deletions aimed at isolating essential domains of IL 1. Proceeding 5 to 3 in the directional sense of protein coding by the cDNA, these three sites are located respectively named and positioned as follows Hind III pos. 483 Pvu II pos. 678 and Xmn I pos. 1355 Note all restriction endonuclease sites presented here are referenced to the location of the first nucleotide on the 3 side of scission as read along the protein coding sense strand of the cDNA . In addition a unique Pst I restriction site located upstream from the cDNA sequence pos. 16 can also be used. The first plasmid construction deletes all IL 1 cDNA nucleotide sequence between the Pvu II and Xmn I sites, described above, and is as follows Plasmid pL1, as described by H. Okayama and P. Berg 1983 Molec. Cell. Biol. 3 280 289, and which can be purchased from Pharmacia Piscataway, NJ , is digested completely with Xmn I and Hind III restriction endonucleases. Three products which result can be resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis. The original human IL 1 cDNA plasmid pcD 415 , contained in the This plasmid is constructed such that all the cDNA sequence between the upstream Pst I site and the Hind III site contained within the human IL 1 sequence is deleted. The starting material is plasmid pcD 415. Plasmid pcD 415 is digested with Hind III endonuclease and the two products approximately 1016 and 3676 base pairs resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis. The 3676 base pair fragment is isolated from the gel and mixed with the pL1 derived, 528 base pair Hind III cohesive ended fragment prepared for use in constructing pcD 415ΔPvu Xmn in Example 1. Ligation of these DNAs by T4 ligase results in two different plasmid products which can be purified and distinguished by transformation of This construction is a combination of both deletions described above located within a single plasmid. The pcD 415ΔPst Hin plasmid, described above, is digested with Pvu II and Xmn I to yield three agarose gel resolvable products approximately 675, 1150, and 2379 base pairs . The 1150 and 2379 base pair fragments are isolated and ligated to yield two possible products which can be resolved in a fashion analogous to that described in Example 1 by selection of transformed The cDNA transcript can be obtained from the clones in essentially pure form by standard art methods. For example, the cDNA transcript in clone pcD 415 can be clipped from the plasmid by a BamHI PstI double digestion Okayama, H. and Berg, P. As is well known in the art, the amino acid sequence of a protein, e.g., IL 1, is determined by the nucleotide sequence of the DNA. Because of the redundancy of the genetic code, i.e., more than one coding nucleotide triplet codon can be used for most of the amino acids used to make proteins, different nucleotide sequences can code for a particular amino acid. Thus, the genetic code can be depicted as follows The above shows that the novel amino acid sequence of human IL 1 and human IL proteins can be prepared by nucleotide sequences other than those disclosed herein. Functionally equivalent nucleotide sequences encoding the novel amino acid sequence of human IL 1, human IL 1 proteins, or fragments thereof having IL 1 activity, can be prepared by known synthetic procedures. Accordingly, the subject invention includes such functionally equivalent nucleotide sequences. Thus the scope of the subject invention includes not only the specific nucleotide sequence depicted herein, but also all equivalent nucleotide sequences coding for molecules with substantially the same human IL 1 biological activity. The term equivalent is being used in its ordinary patent usage here as denoting a nucleotide sequence which performs substantially as the nucleotide sequence identified herein to produce molecules with substantially the same human IL 1 biological activity in essentially the same kind of hosts. Within this definition are subfragments which have human IL 1 biological activity. It is well within the skill of those in the genetic engineering art to use the nucleotide squences encoding human IL 1 activity of the subject invention to produce human IL 1 via microbial processes. Fusing the sequences into an expression vector and transforming or transfecting into hosts, either eukaryotic yeast or mammalian cells or prokaryotic bacterial cells , are standard procedures used in producing other well known proteins, e.g., insulin, interferons, human growth hormone, and the like. Similar procedures, or obvious modifications thereof, can be employed to prepare human IL 1 proteins by microbial means or mammalian tissue culture technology in accord with the subject invention. As disclosed previously, the cDNA sequence in CHART A discloses, via two arrows, a cDNA sequence which itself codes for a peptide having human IL 1 activity. The isolation of this cDNA sequence is disclosed hereinafter. Upon isolation of the cDNA sequence in its essentially pure form it can be cloned by using the procedures described herein for the entire cDNA sequence coding for human IL 1. Those skilled in the art will appreciate the fact that the cDNA fragment depicted includes substantially biologically human IL 1 activity equivalent cDNA sequences, as defined above. The process for isolating the cDNA fragment is as follows The nucleotide sequences obtained from IL 1 clone pcD 415 also can be prepared by a gene machine by procedures well known in the art. This is possible because of the disclosure of the nucleotide sequence. However, it is generally recognized in the art at this time that obtention of the desired nucleotide sequence from a clone, e.g., pcD 415, is the most expedient way to practice an invention such as disclosed and claimed herein. The restriction enzymes disclosed can be purchased from Bethesda Research Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD, or New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA. The enzymes are used according to the instructions provided by the supplier. The various methods employed in the preparation of the plasmids and transformation of host organisms are well known in the art. These procedures are all described in Maniatis, T., Fritsch, E.F., and Sambrook, J. 1982
