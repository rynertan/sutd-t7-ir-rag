# A method of converting a sulphur containing fuel to a substantially sulphur free combustible gas.

## Abstract
The amount of sulfur compounds in combustible gas produced by partial oxidation of a sulfur containing fuel, particularly sulfur containing mineral oil, in a fluidized bed of particles comprising alkaline earth metal oxide can be maintained below a desired level by expedients such as increasing the amount of alkaline earth metal oxide relative to the sulfur in the fuel. These and other possible expedients may attain limiting values due to excessive pressure drop in the fluidized bed and or reduced combustible gas production. In the practics of the invention, it is surprisingly found that the amount of sulfur compound may be maintained below a desired level when a limiting operating condition has been attained or approached by adding fine solids into the combustible gas product. The fine solids may be recovered and re used, e.g. by injection into the fluidized bed.

## Description
The present invention relates to the conversion of sulphur containing fuel into a substantially sulphur free combustible gas and was made in the course of for performed under a contract with the United StatesEnvironmental Protection Agencv. It is nown that sulphur containinr fuels, such as hydrocarbonaceous solids e.g. coal , hydrocarbon liquids ranging from semi liquids such as tar or tar containing materials to fuel oils and lighter hydrocarbon substances and hydrocarbon gases and even substances such as sulphurcontaining gases, either singly or in any feasible combination can be converted to substantially sulphur free gas by at least partial combustion within a bed of particles containing calcium oxide fluidized by an upwardly passing tree oxygn containing gas at suitable elevated fuel conversion temperatures. See, for example, U.K. patent specificationNo. 1336563. If the proportion of free oxygen relative to fuel is high, in stoichiometric terms, he fuel is converted to a substantially sulphurfree fuel gas with the evolution of the heat of combustion of the fuel.If the proportion of free oxygen relative to the fuel is less than stoic biometric, the fuel is partially combusted or gasified and the resulting substantially sulphur free gases are combustible. The amount cf heat liberated depends on the relative proportions of oxygen and fuel and in the case of heavier fuels such as heavy fuel oil, for example, the amount of heat liberated I is just ufficient to maintain he bed at fuel conversion temperatures with cod sulphur retention in the bed particles when the oxygen is about 20 of the sroichiometric proportion. The conversion of sulphur containing fuel as described above is performed in a dense phase fluidizad bad of the calcium oxide containing particles, as is fluidiz d bed operations, certain t of ine parti es fines tends to be elutriated out of the bed i the nverted tes. Since the gases are employed in downstream equipment uch ea urners, heat recovery devices anci similar equipment either singly or in combination and such equipment tends to be reduced in efficiency and or r√†y be damaged by the passage thereinto and therethrough of such fines steps have been taken to reduce the quantity of fines elutriatod from the dense phase bed and also to reduce to an acceptable level the passage of such elutriated fines passing to the downstream equipment and to avoid venting gas containing fines to the atBosphere. Thus, the quantity of fines produced by the bed may be reduced by a proper selection of the naterial of the bed particles, by inter alia regulating the superficial velocity of the fluidizing gases through and above the bed below contain velocities, and the passage of elutriated and entrained particles to downstream equipment is reduced by circulating the substantially sulphur free gas through particles arresting devices such as cyclones or other apparatus having particle retaining functions. If the amount of sulphur associated with fuel entering the fluidized bed increases, e.g. due to an increase in the amount of fuel supplied to the bed to provide an increased amount of substantially sulphur free gas and or due to an increase in the sulphur content of the fuel, the amount of sulphur in the combustible gas leaving the bed tends to increase.Such an increase may be sufficiently small to be acceptable in the gas, but if it is not acceptable, steps must be taken to reduce the sulphurContent or the gas produced in the bed. A number of expedients may be adopted to reduce the sulphur content of the gas to a level not exceeding ac ptable upper limit.For example, the amount of calcium oxide in may be reased by adding particles containing calcium oxide or curso s such lim and or ver, here are li its to the mount acco odated in the The as the volumetric capacit of the ve and the pressure drop th which high value.When ordinary expedients to nt the gas le ving the conversion bed have been e pl i it imposed by economic physical and operational factors, it has been the practice in the past either to accept a gas or lower quality ty having a sulphur cont nt above the normal table o the amount of sulphur supplied to the conve sion bed either a by changing to a fuel of lower sulphur content o b by reducing the fuel input.In many circumstances, neither of th e e p convenient since expedient a requires the provision of a relativ ly l w ulphur fuel in addition to the fuel undergoing conversion, and a art rom the additional storage space required, the quality of the pr duct may differ appreciably from the desired gas product. Expedient b may necessitate reducing the operating capacity of equipment using the gas product. It has now been discovered, and this forms the b is of the invention, that the amount of fines in the converted gas leaving the conversion bed influences the amount of sulphur in The converted gas. According to the invention, there is provided a method of converting a sulphur containing fuel to a substantially sulphur free combustible gas product and of maintaining the amount of sulphu in the gas product below a selected level, the method compri ing gasifving the sulphur containing fuel in gasification equipment fi ti condition within a dense phase fluidized bed of a least some solids comprise alkaline earth metal oxide whereby a combustible gas of low sulphur content containing no more than a minor proportion of entrained fine solids lenves the dense phase bed and wherein the said RTI ID 4.2 combustible gas is caused to pass through a solids separation device whereby at least some of the entrained fine solids are separated from the combustible gas and a combustible gas product of low sulphur content and of reduced solids content is discharged from the separation device, in which when the amount of sulphur in the combustible gas product is at least at the said selected level and the opcrating conditions of the said said gasification equipment include at last one limiting condition which is limiting with respect to reducing the amount of sulphur in the combustible gas product, there is caused to be a regulated increase in the total amount of solids entrained in and or associated with the combustible gas passing to the solids separation device, at least some of the said total amount of solids is separated from the combustible gas by means of the separating device and a combustible gas product having 9 sulphur content below the said selected level is discharged from the sepatating device, at least some of the solids separated by the separating device are transferred from the separating device to the dense phase fluidized bed, the said regulated increase in he said total amount ot solids being regulated in accord ance with the sulfur content of the combustible gas product, or the sulphur content of gases e.g. flue gases derived therefrom. The fines may comprise substances which are in sulphur containing compounds and or the may comprise in nces. The increase amount of way e.g. by the addition of ines solids in the conversion bed and or in the lute phase or r above the bed and or in a conduit through which the converted pas to the downstream equipment. It is preferred for most downstream equipment e.g. recpvery devices, inter alia, that the converted gases be substantially freed of the fines upstream of the equipment. In order to produce a converted gas having ptably low sulphur content without employing more fines than is necessary since this entails a greater load on the fines retaining solids separation equipment, and also on equipment for dispo ing of and or recirculating the thus retained fines , it is desirable to moni or the amount of fines in the converted gases and to regulate the amount accordingly. The monitoring of the amount of fines may be effected in ar convenient manner of which the following are given hy way ot non limitat. examples only In one method, converted gas is caused to impinge on a pivoted or hinged member and deflections of the latter from 2 datum position indicate the fines content of the gas. A signal is generated whose magnitude is representative of the deflection of the member, and the signal is employed to regulate the amount of fines in the gas. In another method, wherein the fines containinR gas is passed through a fines retaining device which separates fines from the gas to give a substantially sulphur free, substantially soJies flee gas the rate of retention or accumulation of solids in the device is monitored and a signal representative of such retention or accumulation rate is employed to regulate the amount of fines in the gas. Thus, the rate of increase in weight of a filter element or device may be monitored, or the rate of fines retention in the dipleg or catchpot of a cyclone.The signal employed to regulate the amount of fines in the gas may be generated directly or inferentially e.g. by measuring a property of the gas which varies with the amount of solids therein for instance, an electrical property such as the electrical capacitance of the gas or an accoustic property or a light transmitting or reflecting property . In accordance with a preferred embodiment Oi the invention, the fines containing converted gases are passed through a fines separation device such as a cyclone, the separated fines are passed to a solids outlet conduit, such as the dipleg of the cyclone and the temperature of the solids in the outlet conduit is monitored. It has been noted that this temperature bears an adequately close relationship to the amount of fines in the fines containing converted gas to be used to generate a fines reguiating signayof sufficient accuracy for most operations. The separated and thus recovered fines may be returned, at least in part, to the fluidized fuel convession bed, and or to the freeboard dilute phase above the bed, in accordance with the requirement for fines to increase sulphur removal from the gases leaving the bed. In addition and or alternatively, the amount of fines elutriatable from the bed may be increased by increasing the velocity of gas through the d, by the addition of Fines fcm another 3ource to the bed, by the attrition Of bed particles preferably within the bed, e.g. using nigh velocity ,ets of gas such as air or by the addition to the bed of a substance which, at the bed conditions, generates fines. Such a material is, e.g., a limestone or like substance which decrepitates.Any combination of the foregoing expedients may be employed, and the finesregulating signal however derived is employed to regulate the amount of fines in the gas leaving the bed. Instead of, and or in addition to, increasing the amount of fines elutriated from the bed, fines may be added directly to gas which has already left the bed. In addition to improving the low sulphur quality of the converted gas, the fines may help to reduce any tendency of deposits to build up on the surfaces of ducts and conduits through which they pass, thereby reducing the flow resistance of gas to downstream equipment. The invention is further described with reference to the accompanying drawing which is a flow diagram of the relevant principal parts of a fuel gasification plant embodying a non limitative example of the invention. The sulphur containing fuel e.g. high sulphur, heavy fuel oil is passed from a storage station 11 via a suitable regulating valve 12 into a bed 13 of fluidizable particles comprising calcium oxide contained in a gasifier vessel 14. The bed 13 is supported cn a suitable air distributor plate 15, and air is passed into the bed 13 via the plate 15 from a fan 16 at a rate determined by the setting of an air valve 17.The air fluidizes the particles in the bed 13 and converts the fuel into combustible gas of low sulphur content at a temnerature in the range 8000C to 110000, preferably 880 to 9200C e.g. about 9000C , sulphur being fixed in part des of the bed as calcium sulfide and other non volatile solid . combustible gas passes out of the bed 13 via the top surface 18 thereo intro the freeboard space 19 in the vessel 14 above the bed 13 and eiuv iates a certain amount of fine solids from the bed, the amount depending, inter alia, on the nature of the bed particles and the superficial velocity of gas through the bed. The combustible gas and entrained solids is conducted from the vessel 14 to gas utiiization equipment 20 such as a burner associated with a heat recovery device e.g. a boiler via a conduit 21, a cyclone separator 22 and a conduit 23. The oas after use in equipment 20 is discharged therefrom via conduit 24. he cyclone separator 22 separates at least some entrained solids from the combustible gas, and the separated solids pass into a dipleg 25 which communicates with a return conduit 26 and a store conduit 27, which. conduits have respective solids flow regulating devices 28, 29 to regulate the amounts of solids passing thereinto from the dipleg 25. The return conduit 26 directs solids into the bed 13 for re use, and there may be suitable equipment not shown of any type known in the ert for promoting the passage of solids through conduit 26 into the bed 13. The store conduit 27 directs solids into a store 30 and the bottom of the latter is connected to a dumping valve 31 normally closed and also to a recycle valve 32 normally open . When desirable or necessary, solids are caused to pass via the recycle valve 32 and a recycle conduit 33 to . solids storage hopper 34 which is constructed and arranged for pass solids into the vessel 14 e.g. into the freeboard space 19 via 1 conduit 35 and a valve 36. i C sulphur content of the combustible gas produced in bed 13 is m s convenient manner. For example, when the combustible gas is burned in equipment 20, it is convenient sul content of the resulting combustion gas in discharge conduit 24 any conventional monitor 37 e.g. O2 .The ulph produces a signal representative of sulphur evels in the ombus and the signal is employed to increase the sulphur retaining action the bed 13, e.g. by causing the addition of further particles comprising calcium oxide to the bed 13 up to the maximum design level of, or pressure drop through, the bed 13. Other actions Day be caused to take place either alternatively or additionally up to limiting values, but the increase in sulphur retaining bed material is referred to here as one typical but non limitative action. when one, some or all actions tending to reduce the level of sulphur as detected by monitor 37 has or have been effected to its or their limiting value s and the sulphur level detected by monitor 37 is still above a selected level, steps are initiated Lo increase the concentration of fine solids in the combustible gas and thereby reduce the amount of sulphur in the gas in accordance with the discovery on which the present invention is based. There are many ways in which the concentration of fine solids in the combustible gas can be increased as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art. For example, when an operating parameter such as the depth of the bed 13 or the superficiai gas velocity in vessel 14 attains a limiting value with an excessively high sulphur content in the combustible gas, the valve 36 may be opened to admit fine solids into vessel 14 from hopper 34. Alternatively, or additionally, valve 29 may be closed and valve 28 opened so that solids recovered in the cyclone 22 are returned to the bed 13 via return conduit 26. The foregoing actions may be regulated directly and or indirectly by the signals produced at monitor 37 from a suitable control er 40. The addition of fine solids to the bed 13 or freeboard space 19 may not necessarily produce the desired amount of entrained solids in the combustible gas, and suitable equipment for monitoring the entrained solids rate may be incorporated in the installation. We have observed that the temperature of the dipleg 25 or of solids therein bears a strong correlation to the amount of entrained solids. This observation is exploited in the illustrated embodiment wherein a temperature sensor 41 monitors the dipleg temperature and influences the opening and closing of valve 36 either alone or by modulating the signal passing to valve 36 from the controller 40. The signal from temperature sensor 41 may also or alternatively be employed to regulate the opening and closing of valves 28 and 29. In order to avoid an excessive build up of particles in the bed 13, a solids dump valve 42 is provided for dumping particles from a zone of bed 13 immediately above the distributor 15. Excess amounts of fines may be dumped by opening the fines valve 31. It is to be understood that the described embodiment has not been described exhaustively but only in relation to the invention, and that moreover, the parts shown in the drawing are not represented to a uniform size scale.
