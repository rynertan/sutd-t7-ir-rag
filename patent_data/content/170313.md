# Electro optical device comprising a laser diode, an input transmission fibre and an output transmission fibre.

## Abstract
An electro optical device is described which comprises a semiconductor laser LD2 to which a plurality of optical transmission fibres SMF1, SMF2 are coupled. By combin ing an input transmission fibre SMF1 and at least one output transmission fibre SMF2 to form a tapered common fibre end portion whose transverse dimension is of the order of that of a single transmission fibre and by coupling this end portion to one radiation emitting surface of the semiconduc tor laser, a standard laser package may be employed and several new uses becime feasible in practice.
