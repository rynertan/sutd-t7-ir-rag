# Laser treatment of electrical steel.

## Abstract
A process is taught for improving the core loss of magnetic materials of the type having a plurality of magnetic domains and an insulative coating thereon. The insulative coating may be a mill glass, an applied coating, or both. The magnetic material is scanned by the beam of a laser across its rolling direction so as to subdivide the magnetic domains without damage to the insulative coating.
