# Apparatus for shaping a distal femoral surface.

## Abstract
The present invention provides an apparatus for prepar ing the distal surface of a femur to receive a distal femoral prosthesis employing an alignment guide 10 which is used to externally locate the central long axis of the femur based upon certain external reference points on the distal femur. The align ment guide is composed of a main body 10 , a pivotable re section guide instrument holder 40 , a locator pin 129 , at least one femoral surface modifying instrument which cooper atively engages with the holder 40 and a means such as a clamp 136 for affixing the main body 10 to the femur to ac complish the shaping of the distal femoral surface. The central long axis of the amin body 10 is brought into alignment with the central long axis of the femur through the use of a locator pin 129 . The pivotable instrument holder 40 holds resection guide instruments 70, 100 at a preselected angle with respect to the main body 10 such that the shaping instruments fixed thereto assume the proper alignment with respect to the cen tral long axis of the femur such that the distal femoral surface is shaped relative to that axis in a simple and accurate manner.
