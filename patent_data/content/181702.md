# 6 Substituted penicillanic acid 1,1 dioxide compounds.

## Abstract
A series of novel derivatives of penicillanic acid 1,1 dioxide, having a disubstituted methyl group of the formula X CH Y at the 6 position, and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof and the pharmaceutically acceptable esters thereof readily hydrolyzable in vivo, wherein X is hydroxy, acylated hydroxy or amino and Y is carboxy or esterified carboxy. The compounds of the invention are inhibitors of bacterial beta lactamases, and they will protect certain beta lactamase susceptible beta lactam antibiotics. e.g. ampicillin, against inactivation by beta lactamases. Co administration of a compound of the invention with a beta lactam antibiotic such as ampicillin to a mammalian subject increases the effectiveness of the beta lactam anti biotic against infections caused by beta lactamase producing bacteria.
