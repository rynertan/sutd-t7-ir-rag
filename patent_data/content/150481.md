# High current CMOS output driver circuit.

## Abstract
A driver circuit is disclosed which is capable of supplying current at a relatively low range for a relatively large supply volt age range. The driver comprises a plurality of output stages designed to operate in parallel. At a low power supply level all the output stages are activated. As the supply voltage is in creased the number of output stage is decreased. All the ele ments of the circuit may be implemented by using transistors so that the whole circuit may be formed on a single IC chip.
