## Description
Green Charcoal and Process of Manufacture The present invention relates to in general to fuel composition. More particul√†rly, this invention relates to green charcoal manufactured from cellulosic biomass matter such as grass, leaves, twigs, seaweeds, garbage, sawdust and other cellulosic materials and to the process of manufacturing thereof. There are various kinds of charcoal presently available in the market today. Generally, these charcoal compositions require charring the raw materials in an enclosed burning chamber to produce a carbonized fuel and by compacting powdered charcoal with binders into briquettes which are more uniform and denser than ordinary charcoal. The present kind of charcoal take a relatively long period of time to ignite and when burning, the flame and heat emoted is unsteady, thus, resulting in either overcooked or undercooked food. Present types of charcoal are usually prepared from wood. In many areas, forests are denuded to provide the population with fuel. This use of wood as charcoal fuel goes against the country s desire to preserve its forests. Fossile fuel which is generally used in industry is exhaustible. The world is now undergoing an energy crisis due to the cost of fossile fuel. Another important fuel source in the Philippines is coal however, this resource is also exhaustible.Continued use of coal at its present rate of consumption will result in depletion of the coal reserve in a matter of years. With the present and ordinary types of fuel there exist several disadvantages they are relatively expensive they are exhaustible they cost the country millions of pesos to procure thus draining our dollar resources. Production of wood charcoal depletes our country s forest reserve. Also it takes longer to wait for trees to grow. It is therefore the object of this present invention to provide a process for producing green charcoal from grasses, leaves, twigs, seaweeds, garbage and other cellulosic materials alone or in judicious combination with coal or charcoal to produce a green charcoal that is economical, has a relatively higher and determinableBTU, is more easily ignited, burns longer with less smoke and has a more acceptable aromatic odor than ordinary charcoal or coal or coke with foul chemical odor. Another object of this invention is to produce green charcoal as a substitute for fossile fuels and coal for use in industry, thereby, saving the country from draining its dollar reserves. Another object of this invention is to produce charcoal briquettes without using outside binders such as starch, molasses, etc., but using the lignin of the basic raw materials such as grasses and leaves. Further object of this invention is to provide a process for producing green charcoal fuel which can be used in industry thus decreasing the actual coal consumption by 20 100 . It is another object of this invention to provide a process for utilizing cellulosic waste materials like grasses, leaves, twigs, seaweed, shrubs, sawdust, forest waste and cellulosic garbage in a process which permits their recycling into a transferable energy form.This recycling method can, thus, not only encourage environmental cleanliness and proper waste utilization but can also process the wastes into fuel which can be used by the community. Another object of this invention is to provide a simplified process for making an economical raw material for the production of town gas and alcohol. A further object of this invention is to provide a process using weeds, grasses and shrubs that normally compete with crops and trees, thus, permitting better growth of food producing crops and also preserving forest. Another object of this invention is to provide a process which can promote environmental cleanliness by gathering and using the waste cellulosic materials such as grasses, weeds and cellulosic garbage, thereby, assisting urban and rural communities in their drive for clean and beautiful surroundings. The cleaning of unsightly grasses and weeds in the community also minimizes breeding places of snakes, rats and other destructive pests. A further object of this invention is to produce a green charcoal fuel which is standard and uniform in size, pelletized for easy handling and which has a high BTU, ignites easily and burns longer than ordinary charcoaled fuel. Another object of this invention is to produce a green charcoal fuel which significantly speeds up the natural process of producing coal from nature.The natural process takes millions of years whereby this invention process can produce a similar fuel in a matter of days. It is another object of this invention to produce a green charcoal fuel which when burned is reduced to a compact ash which retains the original form of the charcoal, thus permitting easy and clean disposal or for utilization in the manufacture of lye, soda ash, etc. Further object of this invention is to produce a green charcoal fuel in which its BTU may be specified according to its use. The BTU of the resultant charcoal may be increased or decreased by adjusting the proportion of synergists catalyst and raw materials. Other objects and advantages of this present invention will become apparent from the following description. Accordingly, this invention relates to the process of producing a green charcoalwhich comprises a gathering the cellulosic material selected from the group consisting of grasses, leaves, twigs, shrubs, giant kelp, water hyacinths, banana leaves or stalks, coconut leaves, blue green algae, sawdust, paper, cellulosic garbage, cellulosic agricultural waste and mixtures thereof b spraying, wetting or soaking said cellulosic material with water c allowing said cellulosic material to partially decay by letting it stand for 3 to 45 days d cutting and grinding the partially decayed cellulosic material e measuring required amounts of decayed cellulosic materials and mixing, if desired, pulverized coal in the proportionate amounts of 10 90 to 90 10 by weight, respectively, however, green charcoal can satisfactorily be produced alone or by itself, i.e. using only grasses and leaves f pelletizing and extruding the green charcoal mixture with the use of suitable grinder and extrusion machine g sorting the green charcoal pellets and drying them thoroughly h packing the resultant green charcoal pellets in sacks for storage or charcoaling and sale. Coal is made from the combined action of millions of years of pressure, heat and partial decay of organic materials. This present invention process utilizes the same principle but in a very much faster method with the use of machines, catalyst and using lignin, the natural plant cement as binder. Green leaves, grasses, twigs, marine plants such as blue green algae, water hyacinth and giant kelp and other seaweeds, cellulosic garbage, weeds, shrubs and other similar organic biomass are used in this invention process as basic raw materials to produce a highly usable form of transferable energy. In this invention coal or charcoal may or may not be used. It is used as a carbonizing catalyst stimulating the energy giving potential of the resultant green charcoal and used in adjusting the desired BTU. Coal or charcoal is advisable to use only in small percentage and when such materials are abundant and cheap in the area. The use of charcoal as a catalyst, therefore, minimizes and reduces the use of coal or wood charcoal as primary fuel, thus, decreasing actual coal consumption from 20 100 . This contributes to the conservation of our country s coal or wood reserve, thereby ensuring the Philippines a longer lasting coal and wood deposit. The procedures of grass grinding, cutting mixing of the ground coal, charcoal or sawdust and partially decayed grasses, peXetizing procedures and the extrusion of green charcoal pellets may be combined into one integrated operation using a suitable machine with a minimum horsepower capacity of 15 HP. The reduction of coal or charcoal to its proper mesh size may be done in a conventional harmmer mill. These machines may be powered by either gasoline, electric hydropower or by a steam boiler which uses the green charcoal itself as fuel. Thus, this invention process may be considered portable, in that, it may be used in any part of the country which has sufficient cellulosic materials for use as raw materials. When burned, the green charcoal emits a steady heat with low clean flame. The charcoal is easy to ignite and burns longer and hotter than ordinary charcoal. The resulting ashes remain in a compact form so that disposal of ashes is clean and easy. The green charcoal produced in this invention process may be used directly as fuel for industry, especially in boilers which can be easily converted to the use of a solid fuel such as green charcoal. The green charcoal resulting from this invention process may also be further processed into more conventional form bv subjecting it to a con ventional kiln or oven typeor retort charcoaling process.The resultant charged green charcoal may then be used for household purposes. The resultant products of this invention, green charcoal, can be utilized as raw material for the manufacture of town gas, alcohol and charcoal for residential and commercial use. The green charcoal may be used as is, to fuel industrial boilers it does not have to be transformed into coke. Activated charcoal can also be produced from green charcoal. It has been discovered in this invention process that the BTU of the resultant green charcoal exceeds the total BTU measurement of individual .components used in the process. This indicates the synergistic and catalystic action brought about by the action of the coal or charcoal on the decayed grasses, leaves, twigs, and other cellulosic matter used as raw materials. It has also been discovered in this invention process that the lignin, the natural cement of plants serve as binder, thus, giving the green charcoal mixture a dense but pliable consistency which improves the firmness and conformation of the end product, without having to use outside binders making the invention process economical.The cell fibers serve as the natural structural support. In this invention, a wide variety of green cellulosic materials including but not limited to grasses, leaves, twigs, weeds, shrubs, marine plants such as algae, water hyacinths, giant kelp and other seaweeds, together with all forms and compositions of cellulosic garbage and agricultural waste materials may be used to produce green charcoal without changing the intent of the process claimed in this invention. As shown in the various examples given in this patent, the proportion of cellulosic materials to coal or charcoal may range from 10 90 and vice versa.However, extensive research has shown that the most desirable range is in the proportion of 40 60 .A higher proportion of coal in the mixture is not only an economical but results in dim ambers and the release or irritating smoke. The proportion of the various cellulosic materials, ground coal may vary accordingly to the level of BTU desired in the resultant product. It is one advantage of this invention that by using this process, the resultant green charcoal now can have a range of BTU levels depending on the proportionate combination of materials. Thus, green charcoal may be produced with BTU of 20,000 or a BTU of 10,000 or a BTU that may be either higher or lower than these two figures. It has been found that although it is possible to use freshly cut grass in this invention process the use of partially decayed grass or similar cellulosic material gives a 10 15 higher BTU than if freshly green material is used. It is also found that more methane or alcohol derivative may be generated from green charcoal product using partially decayed organic matter than from green charcoal using freshly cut organic matter. The process of producing green charcoal in accordance with the present invention shall hereinafter be described in detail Gather grasses, leaves, twigs, water hyacinth, giant kelp, blue green algae and other cellulosic and waste materials including garbage matter, and wet thoroughly these cellulosic materials with water. Allow the soaked cellulosic materials to partially decay by letting them stand for 3 45 days turning them occasionally to prevent excessive interior heat. Reduce chunks of coal or charcoal to 10 100 mesh size or finer by processing, grinding and pulverizing the coal in a suitable machine. Measure required amounts of decayed cellulosic materials and pulverized coal in a proportionate ratio of from 10 90 to 90 10 by weight respectively. The mixture is then passed through a pelletizing and extrusion machine to grind, compact the green charcoal mixture and form into green charcoal pellets of desired size. Pure grass or leaves charcoal can be made and can still yield an average of 8,758 BTU using RETORT charcoaling, average temperature df 244 OC and burning time of 45 minutes for 100 grams. The 60 40 mixture, grass coal on moisture basis, 90 10 grass coal mixture on weight basis produce 14,4 more BTU, 25 more in burning time and 65 more in temperature. The resultant green charcoal pellets are then sorted and placed on suitable pellets and dried thoroughly. The dried green charcoal pellets are placed in suitable sack or container for storage and sale or for making into charcoal and town gas. The following examples illustrate the present invention and are not to be construed as limiting the invention hereinafter claimed. Several modifications and variations can be practiced without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention. Example I Green charcoal using pure grass and leaves Gather assorted grass and leaves often thrown or wastes in both urban and agricultural areas. Pile it near source of cheap water. Cover pile with plastic to reduce loss of water due to evaporation. Sprinkle with water daily to moisten the pile. Compact pile by walking through it or using suitable weight. The purpose is to let the grasses, leaves, and other cellulosic material to partially rot. Depending on temperature, moisture content and compactness partial decay may take place within 3 to 45 days or even longer if not provided with sufficient moisture. The grass fibers must easily break before it is put into the grinding, cutting and pelletizing machine so less energy will be needed to process the green charcoal. Also when partially decayed, the lignin of the plant cells ooze out as cementing material. The grinding, cutting and extruding operation can be done by one machine using a minimum of 10 HP. Lesser or more horsepower can be utilized depending on the volume of pellets desired to produce per hour. After the green charcoal pellets are extruded or formed, the pellets can be solar dried air dried or furnace kiln dried. The dried green charcoal can be marketed as such particularly for industrial boilers, town gas makers or alcohol distillers. Or it can be made into charcoal using the various processes for charcoal making. The resultant green charcoal has an average of 8,758 BTU, 261 OC heating temperature and 100 grams burn in 45 minutes. In actual operation, most types of grasses, leaves, cellulosic agricultural and garbage wastes are mixed resulting to the above BTU average. However, we include without limiting our claims as part of sample n some green charcoal from pure specific leaves and grasses with their corresponding BTU, temperature, moisture content and some observations. All the procedures follow sample 1, except that fresh grass were processed immediately. Sample 1a 0 Pure fresh binunga leaves, BTU 5980 150 C average heating temperature, 45 minutes burning time fqr 100 grams sample. Sample 1b Pure fresh ipil ipil leaves with stalk, BTU 8096.72 0 172 C 30 minutes burning time. Sample 1c Pure fresh banig banig grass Visayan , same as para grass but thinner, BTU 7333.2 32 minutes burning time, 42 OC heating temperature. Sample 1d Pure fresh water hyacinth BTU 1,943 182 C 20 minutes burning time. Sample 1e Pure Cassava leaves, BTU 3,247 186 C 35 minutes burning time. Sample 1f Pure fresh bakawan leaves, BTU 3,067.1 4 102 OC heating temperature 15 minutes burning time.
