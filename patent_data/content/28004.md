# Magneto fluidic recording apparatus.

## Abstract
A recording apparatus which uses magneto fluidic material comprising a magnetic multi stylus head 1 ar ranged in parallel to oppose a recording plane, a magnet 2 fixed to the multi stylus head near a tip end thereof, means 6, 7, 18 for supplying magneto fluidic material to at least one point of the magnet 2 and means 15, 16 for causing the magneto fluidic material on the multi stylus to selectively be flung, wherein a plurality of areas of con centration of lines of magnetic force are formed on at least one of outer surfaces of the magnet 2 in order to stabilize the supply of the magneto fluidic material for the consumption of the magneto fluidic material on the multi stylus head 1 due to the flying of the magneto fluidic ma terial.
