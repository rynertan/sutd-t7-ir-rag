# Glycerol ester hydrolase and method for its production.

## Abstract
An enzyme which catalyzes the hydrolysis of glycerol esters is disclosed. The enzyme is specific for alkyl esters wherein the alkyl group has from 1 to 4 carbon atoms inclusive. The enzyme is particularly useful in hydrolyzing a diacetyl glycerol ester. The enzyme is from the microorgan ism Bacillus subtilis ATCC No. 31954.
