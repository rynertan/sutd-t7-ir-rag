## Description
The present invention relates to a circuit for extracting or regenerating frame synchronizing signals and particularly to a circuit having the features of the preamble of claim 1. An audio signal can be digitally recorded on a disc by a pulse code modulation PCM system. The audio PCM signal is recorded on a base band which is not the carrier modulation system and can be, for example, amplitude modulation, frequency modulation, or the like. A run length limited code has been used to record the audio PCM signal on the disc. In a run length limited code, a minimum transition interval T The digital signal is frequently separated into a number of blocks or frames so that error correction and other processing can be easily performed. Usually, each block of data is individually processed in the conversion of analog data. In a digital audio disc, the length of one data block is made equal to one frame period. Each data block, of course, is provided at its start point with a frame or block synchronizing signal. A bit pattern not used in the run length limited code is ordinarily selected as the frame synchronizing signal for ease of detection. One prior art system takes advantage of the fact that the modulation output of two maximum transition intervals T However, the frame synchronizing signal is not always properly detected and processed. Accordingly, a compensating circuit which compensates for an improperly detected and or processed frame synchronizing signal is generally provided in the reproducing apparatus. The compensating circuit in the reproducing apparatus must accommodate a number of different kinds of errors. For example, a frame synchronizing signal can be omitted or dropped by a scratch or the like formed on the surface of the disc. As another example, a pulse form which closely resembles the frame synchronizing signal can occur in a reproduced signal. Such a digital signal can be erroneously identified as a frame synchronizing signal, with the result that subsequent data processing operations are erroneously performed. As a third example, when a digital audio disc player is operated in a search mode to access the beginning of an audio signal, the frame synchronizing signal might not be detected. It is preferable for the frame synchronizing signal to be immediately identified upon the completion of the search mode, so that the audio signal can be correctly reproduced in the normal playback mode. As a fourth example, the frame period for the digital data can vary. Conventional compensating circuits for use in reproducing apparatuses require a memory which operates at high speed. A majority logic circuit is also used to identify the frame synchronizing signals. In such a majority logic circuit, when a doubtful frame synchronizing pulse occurs repeatedly at the same position in each frame period, the doubtful frame synchronizing pulses cannot be removed. Reproducing apparatuses for digitally recorded signals generally employ a control circuit to control the rotational speed of the disc. A velocity control circuit controls large fluctuations in the speed of the disc. A phase control circuit controls minor fluctuations in the speed of the disc since it has a limited lock range. The phase control circuit thus cannot be locked into operation until the speed of the disc is approximately set by the velocity control circuit. Accordingly, the speed of the disc must be ascertained before the phase control circuit is switched into operation with the velocity control circuit. It is further known a speed control circuit for a video disk Neues aus der Technik , no.1, 15th February 1978, p.439 . In this circuit a reproduced TV signal is supplied to a line sync pulse detector and a gate. A decoder supplies gate, or control, signals to a gate. As long as the frequency of the detected line sync pulse does not conform with that of the desired signal, in other words, when the line sync pulse is not detected, the said decoder supplies a control signal so that the said gate is open, whereby all pulses supplied by the line sync pulse detector are supplied to the said detector. When the frequencies of the actual and desired signals are similar, the said gate is normally closed. It is only opened shortly before the next line sync pulse is expected. When the next line sync pulse is detected, it is supplied to the said detector for phase comparison and, at the same time, supplied to a counter to reset same to zero, whereby the said gate is closed. From this it results that the said gate is closed by the detected synchronizing signal. Therefore, when the synchronizing signal is erroneously detected, even if the correct synchronizing signal is detected immediately thereafter, it is not adapted. While,when the synchronizing signal is not detected,if the delayed interpolating synchronizing signal is used for resetting,not only the synchronizing signal is delayed but also the window period thereafter is shifted. However,with the aforementioned control circuit a compensation of errors is possible. When the synchronisation signal is missing, which is considered as an error case,an interpolating synchronizing pulse is generated,i.e. the said error is compensated. The aforementioned known control circuit is, however, not suitable for realisation a simple compensation of errors which occur in detecting of frame synchronizing signals. It is the object of the present invention to provide an apparatus for reproducing a digital signal with a simple compensating circuit for handling errors which occur in detecting a frame synchronizing signal. The aforementioned object of the invention is achieved by the features of claim 1. From the circuit of claim 1 the advantage results that it is possible to reproduce a digital signal which does not suffer from the above described defects in the prior art. Furthermore it is easely possible to process errors which occur in detecting a frame synchronizing signal. In addition a digital signal can be reproduced without the requirement of the large capacity memory. A further advantage of the present invention results from the fact that a digital signal can be reproduced which occur at the same position during successive frame periods and which is erroneously identified as a frame synchronizing signal. Furthermore it is possible by the present invention to reproduce a digital signal which can perform optimum frame synchronizing signal compensation operations in accordance with more than one operating mode of a reproducing apparatus. A still further advantage of the present invention results from the fact that a digital signal can be reproduced by an apparatus in which a phase control circuit is used which makes minor corrections to the speed of the reproducing apparatus, whereby the said control circuit is used in addition to a velocity control circuit, which makes large corrections to the speed of the reproducing apparatus, in response to a circuit which detects the frame synchronizing signals. The above, and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following detailed description of an illustrative embodiment thereof which is to read in connection with the accompanying drawings. In a prior art compensating circuit as illustrated in Fig. 1, a reproduced digital data signal is supplied to an input terminal 1 and a shift register 2. Shift register 2 has shift stages for n bits corresponding to the length of a frame synchronizing signal. Data having n parallel bits are supplied by shift register 2 to a frame synchronizing signal detection circuit or detector 3. The frame synchronizing signal in the reproduced digital data signal is identified in frame synchronizing signal detector 3 when the bit pattern of the frame synchronizing signal coincides with a predetermined bit pattern. The data from shift register 2 are also supplied to a memory unit 4 which stores therein one block or frame period of data. The data stored in memory unit 4 is then supplied to a shift register 5 and is delayed by one frame period. Shift register 5 is similar to shift register 2, and has shift stages for n bits so that parallel data of n bits are delivered from shift register 5 to a second frame synchronizing signal detection circuit or detector 6 wherein the frame synchronizing signal is detected again just as in frame synchronizing signal detector 3 . The data from shift register 5 is also supplied to a second memory unit 7 which is similar to memory unit 4 and stores one block of data therein. Data stored in memory unit 7 is delayed by one frame period and supplied to a shift register 8. Shift register 8 is similar to shift registers 2 and 5 so that parallel data of n bits are supplied to a third frame synchronizing signal detection circuit or detector 9 wherein the frame synchronizing signal is detected when it is delayed by two frame periods with respect to the reproduced digital data. Frame synchronizing signal detection signals F₀, F₁, and F₂ generated, respectively, by frame synchronizing signal detectors 3, 6 and 9, are supplied to a majority logic circuit 10. Majority logic circuit 10 supplies an output signal F If two or more frame synchronizing signals successively drop out of the digital signal, the phases of two or more of frame synchronizing signal detection signals F₀, F₁, and F₂ do not coincide at the time when the drop outs occur, so that majority logic circuit 10 does not produce output signal F Clock generator 13 supplies clock pulses CP to a clock terminal of a counter 11. Counter 11 produces a carry pulse F Carry pulse F In Fig. 1, it is to be appreciated that the reproduced digital data is generated at output terminal 15. A digitally recorded signal on a disc must be synchronized in a bit wise fashion with a clock signal in the reproducing apparatus for the reproduction to be performed. When the clock signal and the reproduced signal deviate in phase from each other, and the phase deviation is added thereto, a cycle slip phenomenon can occur in which the frame synchronizing signal from one cycle period is dropped and or changed in position. In a bit synchronizing circuit, the frequency of a variable frequency oscillator in a phase locked loop PLL circuit and the time constant of a low pass filter are selected so that a time error caused by the cycle slip phenomenon is kept to about 1 or 2 bits. The operation of the circuit of Fig. 1 will now be described with reference to the timing charts of Figs. 2A to 2F, 3A to 3F, and 4A to 4F. In Fig. 2A, the period between the third and fourth frame synchronizing signals is shortened due to the cycle slip phenomenon, while the seventh and eighth frame synchronizing signals disappear due to drop outs. The periods identified by the X marks in Figs. 2A to 2F indicate periods having erroneous lengths. As illustrated in Fig. 2D, output signal F Counter 11 is reset by output signal F Output signal F Figs. 3A to 3F illustrate a digital signal in which cycle slip occurs between the third and fourth frame synchronizing signals and the length of the period accordingly becomes longer than one frame period, and in which drop outs occur in the seventh and eighth frame periods. Since the length of the cycle slip is longer than one frame period, counter 11 is not reset before it generates carry pulse F Figs. 4A to 4F illustrate a digital signal in which the noise therein is mixed with the frame synchronizing signal to form a doubtful frame synchronizing signal. Figs. 4A to 4F also illustrate the digital signal from a reproducing apparatus operated in the search mode wherein the frame synchronizing signals are not detected by the frame synchronizing signal detectors 3, 6, 9. In Figs. 4A to 4C, the doubtful frame synchronizing signal does not overlap at the same position in frame synchronizing signal detection signals F₀, F₁ and F₂, so that majority logic circuit 10 produces output signal F When the reproducing apparatus is operated in the search mode, and the frame synchronizing signal is not detected, counter 11 produces signal F The circuit of Fig. 1, however, suffers from significant drawbacks. First, the circuit requires a memory unit which operates at high speed. Second, majority logic circuit 10 cannot remove a doubtful frame synchronizing pulse which repeatedly occurs at the same position in each frame period. Several points must be considered in a frame synchronizing signal detecting and compensating circuit. First, a cycle slip which occurs in the reproduced digital signal is normally about 1 or 2 bits, and is quite small when compared with the length of the frame period. Second, since the pattern for the frame synchronizing signal is especially selected, a safe region must be provided before and after the frame synchronizing signal so that it can be accurately detected. Third, the pattern for the frame synchronizing signal is not a pattern which ordinarily occurs in the modulation system so that as long as a drop out and a doubtful frame synchronizing signal are not mixed, the probability of the same pattern randomly occurring in the digital signal is approximately zero. There are at least two known methods by which an audio pulse coded modulation PCM signal can be recorded on a disc. According to one method, the PCM signal is recorded with a constant angular velocity. In an alternate method, the PCM signal is recorded with a constant linear velocity. Recordings made with a constant linear velocity are preferable to recordings made with a constant angular velocity because the recording density for such recordings can be increased. In such an instance, the disc on which the recording is made must be reproduced at a constant linear velocity. One known method for controlling disc rotation at a constant linear velocity detects the position of a pick up device by a potentiometer. Since the disc must rotate faster as the pick up device moves away from the center of the disc, the output signal from the potentiometer is fed to a divider circuit to generate speed control information from the position of the pick up device. However, a potentiometer and a divider circuit for generating the speed control signals are both expensive and complicated. According to another method, the disc is rotated at a constant linear velocity by detecting a signal reproduced from the disc. The length of time for a transition interval is measured and compared with a standard reference value. The speed of the disc is then changed according to the comparison. When the content of a disc is reproduced at a constant linear velocity, a minimum transition interval T Since the frame synchronizing signal is reproduced at each frame period, a velocity control circuit can be operated so that successive maximum transition intervals T In Fig. 5, a PCM audio disc reproducing apparatus includes a velocity control system 100, a phase control system 200, and a frame synchronizing signal detecting and compensating circuit 300 in accord with the present invention. Frame synchronizing signal detecting and compensating circuit 300 generates a detection signal in response to a frame synchronizing signal and compensates for drop outs, cycle slips, or the like. Compensating circuit 300 also generates a signal which determines whether the operation of phase control system 200 is added to velocity control system 100. In velocity control system 100, an optical pick up device 101 generates a signal which is supplied to a wave shaping circuit 102. The output signal from optical pick up device 101 can be blunted or rounded. For example, a sinusoidal wave may be generated in response to data bits of 1 and 0 . Wave shaping circuit 102 reshapes the signal from optical pick up device 101 and delivers a substantially square wave in response to the blunted input wave. A counter 103 detects the maximum transition interval T When output signal SP has a transition interval in which the number of clock pulses CP counted therein exceeds a predetermined number N where N is a value counted during maximum transition interval T Output signal N₀ from NAND gate 109 is latched to a D type flip flop circuit 110 in response to the rising edge of a signal SFX. A quartz oscillator 111 supplies an output clock pulse to frequency divider 112 which divides the output clock pulses to generate signal SFX. In the illustrative embodiment, signal SFX has a frame period of 1 7.35 kHz. After output signal N₀ from NAND gate 109 is latched to D type flip flop circuit 110 as described above, signal SFX is supplied to a clear terminal CL of counter 103 through a delay circuit 113 and AND gate 107 whereby counter 103 is cleared. Output signal N₀ from NAND gate 109 becomes 1 to place counter 103 in a count enable state and NAND gates 105 and 106 in an open state. Thus, the number of clock pulses CP counted during the transition intervals of the output signal SP are counted again. Accordingly, counter 103 detects whether the maximum transition interval T A charge and discharge circuit 120 includes a capacitor 121 for charge and discharge, a positive current source 122 and a negative current source 123. When an output signal VS from the Q terminal of D type flip flop circuit 110 is 0 , and an output signal Accordingly, capacitor 121 is charged and discharged in response to the output signals from D type flip flop circuit 110. The voltage developed across capacitor 121 is supplied to an inverting input terminal of an operational amplifier 130 which operates as a comparator. A positive DC voltage ES is supplied to a non inverting input terminal of operational amplifier 130. A difference output signal from operational amplifier 130 is supplied to a motor driving circuit not shown for rotating the disc. When the rotational speed of the disc is slower than a predetermined linear velocity, the maximum transition interval T When the rotational speed of the disc is higher than a predetermined linear velocity, the maximum transition interval T When the disc rotates at a constant linear velocity, the voltage across capacitor 121 is reduced substantially to zero. A diode 126 with a cathode connected to ground is connected in parallel to capacitor 121 to prevent the motor from rotating in a reverse direction. When a potential at a point P in Fig. 5 is a positive voltage and exceeds reference voltage ES, the output signal from operational amplifier 130 approaches a negative voltage so that the motor would begin to rotate in a reverse direction. However, since diode 126 is connected between point P and ground, it is switched on. Hence, the potential at point P does not become positive, and the motor does not rotate in a reverse direction. With reference to phase control system 200, signal SFX has a reference frame period which is produced by dividing the frequency of the output signals from quartz oscillator 111 in frequency divider 112. Signal SFX can form a constant phase relationship with a signal SFG which is synchronized with the frame synchronizing signal SF detected in the reproduced signal by frame synchronizing signal detecting and compensating circuit 300. The lock frequency for phase control system 200 is a function of the oscillation frequency generated by quartz oscillator 111. In the illustrative embodiment, the oscillation frequency of quartz oscillator 111 is selected so that when the maximum transition interval T Signal SFX is supplied to a flip flop circuit 201 which generates a signal F₁ which is inverted at the leading edge of signal SFX. A signal SFG, having a frame period derived from frame synchronizing signal detecting and compensating circuit 300, is supplied to a flip flop circuit 202 which generates a signal F₂ which is inverted at the leading edge of signal SFG. Signals F₁ and F₂ are supplied to input terminals of an AND gate 203 which generates an output signal A₁ indicative of the difference in phase between output signals F₁ and F₂. Output signal A₁ is supplied to the input terminals of AND gates 205 and 206. Signal F₂ from the Q output terminal of flip flop 202 is supplied to a D terminal of a D type flip flop circuit 204. Signal F₁ from the Q terminal of a D type flip flop 210 is supplied to clock terminal CK of flip flop circuit 204. An output signal UD from the Q output terminal of flip flop 204 is supplied to one input terminal of an AND gate 205. Output signal UD is also supplied to an inverter 207 which supplies its output to an AND gate 206. AND gate 205 supplies an output signal A₂ to a charge and discharge circuit 210. AND gate 206 supplies an output signal A₃ to charge and discharge circuit 210. Charge and discharge circuit 210 generates a phase control voltage in response to output signals A₂ and A₃ and includes a capacitor 211 for charge and discharge, a positive current source 212, and a negative current source 213. When output signal A₂ from AND gate 205 is 1 , a switching circuit 214 is switched on so that positive current source 212 permits a charging current i As illustrated in Figs. 6L and 6M, when signals F₁ and F₂ have a phase difference of 180 , signals SFX and SFG have no phase difference therebetween. Output signal A₂ from AND gate 205 becomes 0 at all times. Phase control system 200 operates so that signals SFX and SFG maintain a predetermined phase relation therebetween. When signals SFX and SFG have the phase relationship depicted in Figs. 6A and 6C, and output signals F₁ and F₂ from flip flop circuits 201 and 202 have a 180 phase difference as illustrated in Figs. 6B and 6D, output signal UD from flip flop circuit 204 becomes 0 , as shown in Fig. 6F. Output signal A₁ from AND gate 203 has the displacement shown in Fig. 6E. Although output signal A₂ from AND gate 205 becomes 0 , as shown in Fig. 6G, AND gate 206 produces a signal having a width dependent on the phase deviation which is shown in Fig. 6H and identified as output signal A₃. Switching circuit 215 is switched on to allow a discharging current i When signals SFX and SFG deviate in phase with respect to each other, as indicated in Figs. 6A and 6C, the width of output signal A₁ from AND gate 203 does not change, but output signal UD from D type flip flop 204 becomes 1 , as illustrated in Fig. 6I. Output signal A₂ of AND gate 205 has a width representative of the phase deviation as shown in Fig. 6G so that switching circuit 214 is switched on and switching circuit 215 is switched off thereby permitting a charging current i The voltage across capacitor 211 is added to the output voltage from charge and discharge circuit 120 in velocity control system 100 and then supplied to the inverting input terminal of operational amplifier 130 where it controls the speed of the motor. In the illustrated embodiment, charge and discharge circuit 120 has a time constant T Signal SFG generates a phase control signal and is derived from frame synchronizing signal detecting and compensating circuit 300 by frequency dividing an output signal of a PLL circuit which is synchronized with the clock component in the reproduced digital signal. The PLL circuit of frame synchronizing signal detecting and compensating circuit 300 has a limited lock range so that until the rotational speed of the disc is approximately equal to a predetermined linear velocity, the phase control system 200 cannot be brought into operation. It is to be appreciated that the rotational speed of the disc cannot be locked in phase with the output signal from quartz oscillator 111 following a large fluctuation in the linear velocity of the disc which can occur when the pick up device scans the disc. Accordingly, phase control system 200 is disabled until the linear velocity of the disc becomes substantially constant. In order to detect the frame synchronizing signal, a clock pulse is synchronized with the clock component in the reproduced digital signal and the bit pattern resulting therefrom is compared with the bit pattern from the frame synchronizing signal in the reproduced digital signal. In the illustrative embodiment, the output signal from the PLL circuit as described above is used for the clock pulse. Accordingly, when the linear velocity has not reached the predetermined speed, the PLL circuit is not locked in phase with the reproduced clock signal and the frame synchronizing signal cannot be reliably detected. Frame synchronizing signal detecting and compensating circuit 300 thus includes a supervisory circuit which keeps a close watch on whether the frame synchronizing signal is reliably detected. Output signal SL derived from frame synchronizing signal detecting and compensating circuit 300 is at a high level when the frame synchronizing signal is not reliably detected, as described hereinbelow. Output signal SL is supplied to AND gates 205, 206 through an inverter 208 so that until the linear velocity of the disc reaches a predetermined value, AND gates 205 and 206 are turned off by output signal SL, thereby inhibiting the operation of phase control system 200. Fig. 7 illustrates one embodiment of a frame synchronizing signal detecting and compensating circuit 300 in accord with the present invention. Signal SP, such as digital data or the like, from wave shaping circuit 102 see Fig. 5 is supplied to an input terminal 301 and hence, to a frame synchronizing signal detection circuit or detector 302. A clock pulse CP is synchronized with the reproduced signal derived from a clock generator 308 which includes a PLL circuit and is supplied to detector 302. Detector 302 generates a frame synchronizing signal detection signal SFO by detecting a signal having a bit pattern which is the same as the frame synchronizing signal in the reproduced signal as described hereinbefore. Frame synchronizing signal detection signal SFO is supplied to a protecting circuit 303 which mutes frame synchronizing detection signal SFO to prevent noise from being erroneously detected as a frame synchronizing signal. Protecting circuit 303 is most commonly utilized in the period during playback when the position of the pick up device jumps and there is no reproduced signal. Protecting circuit 303 may be eliminated from the circuit of Fig. 7 and the circuit will operate as herein described. Frame synchronizing signal detection signal SFO is supplied through protecting circuit 303 to a gate circuit 304. A window pulse PW supplied from an OR gate 305 functions as a gate signal for gate circuit 304. In one embodiment, window pulse PW has a pulse width of 2 m bits m bits the position at which a normal frame synchronizing signal occurs . In one example, m can be equal to three. When a frame synchronizing signal occurs at the correct position and the phase of window pulse PW substantially coincides therewith, gate circuit 304 supplies a detection signal SFW to an OR gate 306. Detection signal SFW is also supplied to a clear terminal CL of a counter 307. A clock pulse CP is supplied to a clock terminal of counter 307. Clock pulse CP is synchronized with the clock component of the reproduced signal and is derived from a clock generator 308 equipped with a PLL circuit so that counter 307 generates a carry pulse SFC for each frame period. Carry pulse SFC is synchronized with the reproduced signal which results from dividing the frequency of clock pulse CP and is supplied to one input terminal of OR gate 306. OR gate 306 supplies a frame synchronizing signal detection signal SFG, as described more fully hereinbelow, to an output terminal 317. Window pulse PW is generated in response to the count value from counter 307. When the count value n in counter 307, which corresponds to the frame period, is reduced by a number corresponding to m bits of the maximum value of a cycle slip for example, 3 bits , the reduced count number n m is detected by an n m detector 309 and a flip flop circuit 310 is accordingly set. When the count value of counter 307 corresponds to m bits, such count number is detected in an m detector 311 so that flip flop circuit 310 is reset. Since counter 307 is cleared by detection signal SFW, flip flop circuit 310 generates a window signal which rises at a position m bits before the frame synchronizing signal occurs and which falls m bits after the trailing edge of the frame synchronizing signal. The window signal is supplied to one input terminal of OR gate 305 and comprises window pulse PW for gate circuit 304. Gate circuit 304 does not generate detection signal SFW when the phase of the frame synchronizing signal significantly deviates from carry pulse SFC. A supervisory circuit explained more fully hereinbelow detects the phase displacement between the frame synchronizing signal and carry pulse SFC and forces counter 307 to make the frame synchronizing signal coincide in phase with carry pulse SFC. Supervisory counter 312 comprises in part the above described supervisory circuit. Detection signal SFW is supplied to a load terminal LD of supervisory counter 312 to preset the count value therein. An output signal from m detector 311 is supplied to a clock terminal of supervisory counter 312 when the count value from counter 307 corresponds to m bits. Since counter 307 counts the number of clock pulses CP at all times, m detector 311 generates a signal at each frame period which is supplied to and counted by supervisory counter 312. Gate circuit 304 generates detection signal SFW which is supplied to load terminal LD of supervisory counter 312 so that supervisory counter 312 is preset. It is to be appreciated that the count value in supervisory counter 312 does not increment more than the preset value plus one. When gate circuit 304 does not generate detection signal SFW, supervisory counter 312 counts the output signal from m detector 311 so that the count value therein increments. When the count value of supervisory counter 312 reaches a predetermined value for example, eight , supervisory counter 312 generates an output signal SL which rises to a high level. Since output signal SL is supplied to an enable terminal EN of supervisory counter 312, the counting operation of supervisory counter 312 stops. Output signal SL from supervisory counter 312 is also supplied to gate circuit 304 as window pulse PW via OR gate 305. In other words, the gate signal remains at a high level to keep gate circuit 304 in an open state. When gate circuit 304 generates detection signal SFW, supervisory counter 312 is placed into a load state again whereby output signal SL drops to a low level and supervisory counter 312 returns to a count enable state. Functionally, when the phase of carry pulse SFC deviates considerably from the phase of the frame synchronizing signal in the reproduced signal, so that frame synchronizing signal detection signal SFO does not fall within the width of window pulse PW, supervisory counter 312 detects such deviation and permits counter 307 to be cleared whereby the phase of carry pulse SFC is made to coincide with the frame synchronizing signal in the reproduced signal. In the illustrative embodiment, supervisory counter 312 can be a preset type or an ordinary clear type counter. In accordance with the present invention, the width of window pulse PW arid the preset value for supervisory counter 312 are controlled in accord with the operating mode of the reproducing apparatus and the state of the reproduced signal so that the compensating circuit will operate most efficiently. In a normal playback mode, the width of window pulse PW is such that it will gate the frame synchronizing signal detection signal even when a cycle slip occurs. For example, the frame synchronizing signal can be within 3 bits of the position where it is expected to be detected. The width of 3 bits is generally acceptable in a normal playback mode when the data error in the reproduced signal is random. However, when there are a large number of burst errors in the reproduced signal, the amount of cycle slip increases since the amount of the phase deviation between the reproduced signal and the clock signal accumulates. The width of window pulse PW must be correspondingly widened. Supervisory counter 312 corrects phase deviations between window pulse PW and frame synchronizing signal detection signal SFO. When the frame synchronizing signal is reliably detected, as in a normal playback mode, the phase of window pulse PW is correct even if detection signal SFW disappears as a result of a drop out or the like. If the supervisory circuit operates under such conditions, the width of window pulse PW is substantially increased. Noise, such as a doubtful frame synchronizing signal and the like, cannot be eliminated, however. Accordingly, the number of frames required to be detected before output signal SL rises to a high level is relatively large, for example, sixteen. It is to be appreciated that the number of frames required to raise output signal SL to the high level is the same as the number of output signals generated by m detector 311. When the reproducing apparatus is operated in a search mode to access the beginning of a recording, output signal SL rises to a high level shortly after the frame synchronizing signal is no longer detected. In the illustrative embodiment, output signal SL rises to a high level after three frame periods. When the reproduced signal disappears during playback, supervisory counter 312 raises output signal SL to a high level immediately after the frame synchronizing signal disappears. In addition, the rotational speed of the disc is controlled when the reproduced signal disappears so that the width of window pulse PW is increased to its maximum. The supervisory circuit in accordance with the present invention includes an RF detector 313 which detects the presence of a reproduced signal and supplies a detected output signal to a controller 316. A system controller 314 supplies a signal to controller 316 which indicates the operating mode of the reproducing apparatus. An error correction circuit 315 detects errors in the reproduced signal and supplies a signal indicative of the errors to controller 316. Controller 316 supplies control signals to n m detector 309 and m detector 311 to vary the count value corresponding to the m bits. The value of m and the corresponding width of window pulse PW vary in accordance with the errors detected in the digital signal by error correction circuit 315. Controller 316 supplies an output signal to vary the preset value of supervisory counter 312 in accord with the operating mode of the reproducing apparatus and the presence of a reproduced signal detected by RF detector 313. The operation of the frame synchronizing signal detecting and compensating circuit of Fig. 7 will now be described with reference to the timing charts of Figs. 8, 9 and 10. In Figs. 8A to 8E, the digital signal supplied to the circuit of Fig. 7 has a frame period which is shorter than a normal frame period because of a cycle slip, and also has drop outs in the seventh and eighth frames. Fig. 8A illustrates frame synchronizing signal detection signal SFO from frame synchronizing signal detector 302. Fig. 8B illustrates window pulse PW generated by flip flop circuit 310. Fig. 8C illustrates detection signal SFW generated by gate circuit 304. Fig. 8D illustrates carry pulse SFC generated by counter 307. Fig. 8E illustrates frame synchronizing signal detection signal SFG generated by OR gate 306. In Fig. 8, the amount of cycle slip is small when there are a large number of random errors in the reproduced signal and a relatively small number of burst errors. The amount of cycle slip is much greater when there are many burst errors. The width of window pulse PW varies according to the number of errors in the signal so that the detection signal for the frame synchronizing signal is substantially certainly contained within the width of window pulse PW even considering the cycle slip. Gate circuit 304 generates detection signal SFW to clear counter 307 before carry pulse SFC is generated so that the width of window pulse PW is narrowed. Accordingly, carry pulse SFC is dropped during the period where the cycle slip occurs, as shown in Fig. 8D. During the period where the drop outs occur, a frame synchronizing signal is not detected within the width of window pulse PW, so that gate circuit 304 does not generate detection signal SFW. However, if counter 307 is correctly cleared by one detection signal SFW before the drop outs occur, counter 307 generates carry pulse SFC having the correct frame period. Carry pulse SFC is then supplied through OR gate 306 to output terminal 317 as frame synchronizing signal detection signal SFG. In Figs. 9A to 9E, the digital signal supplied to the circuit of Fig. 7 contains a cycle slip and drop outs in the seventh and eighth periods. The period length exceeds the normal frame period because of the cycle slip. Detection signal SFW from gate circuit 304 clears counter 307 after counter 307 has generated carry pulse SFC so that the timing of carry pulse SFC differs from the normal timing. As illustrated in Fig. 9E, frame synchronizing signal detection signal SFG supplied at input terminal 317 has double frame synchronizing signals as a result of the cycle slip. In Fig. 10A, the digital signal supplied to the circuit of Fig. 7 includes a doubtful frame synchronizing signal mixed with the frame synchronizing signal, and a drop out in the fourth period. In addition, the reproducing apparatus is operated in a search mode to access the beginning of an audio signal, during which time frame synchronizing signal detection signal SFO drops out. The doubtful frame synchronizing signal does not fall within the width of window pulse PW so that the doubtful frame synchronizing signal is eliminated, and gate circuit 304 delivers a correctly timed detection signal SFW. During the search mode of operation of the reproducing apparatus, gate circuit 304 does not generate a detection signal SFW in response to output signal SL from supervisory counter 312. As noted before, supervisory counter 312 generates output signal SL when three frame synchronizing signals have been omitted. Gate circuit 304 is thus opened by output signal SL, as indicated in Fig. 10F. When the reproducing apparatus is operated in the normal playback mode, after operation in the search mode, gate circuit 304 generates detection signal SFW which places supervisory counter 312 into the load mode and clears counter 307. Carry pulse SFC becomes discontinuous just after the search mode is terminated, as illustrated in Fig. 10D, but is correctly synchronized shortly thereafter. As hereinbefore described, frame synchronizing signal detecting and compensating circuit 300 produces frame synchronizing signal detection signal SFG even when a drop out in the digital signal occurs. Frame synchronizing signal detecting and compensating circuit 300 also produces output signal SL to indicate whether the frame synchronizing signal has been reliably detected. As explained above, output signal SL determines whether phase control system 200 is added to velocity control system 100. It is to be appreciated that a frame synchronizing signal detecting and compensating circuit in accord with the present invention does not require a memory with a large capacity or the like. As will be evident from the discussion hereinbefore, when an erroneous frame synchronizing signal occurs at the same position during consecutive frame periods, such erroneous signal can be removed since the frame synchronizing signal detection signal is gated by a gate pulse which is wide enough to accommodate the correct frame synchronizing signal but narrow enough to eliminate the erroneous signal. The compensating circuit in accord with the present invention also compensates for a dropped frame synchronizing signal when the reproducing apparatus is operated in the playback mode. The compensating circuit in accord with the present invention further prevents an incorrect or arbitrary addition of the phase control system to the velocity control system used in determining the rotational speed of the disc since the phase control system is added to the velocity control system in response to a signal from a supervisory circuit which keeps watch on whether the frame synchronizing signal is reliably detected. It is to be further appreciated that the supervisory circuit operates immediately when the reproducing apparatus is operated in the playback mode and also in response to the state of the reproduced signal. Accordingly, the speed control system for the reproducing apparatus can be correctly operated since the output signal from the supervisory circuit is used to control the addition of the phase control system to the velocity control system. The present invention is not limited to a reproducing apparatus for a pulse coded modulation audio disc, but can be applied to any apparatus which reproduces a digital signal recorded in the base band and which, upon reproduction, has a frame or block synchronizing signal.
