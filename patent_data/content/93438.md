## Description
NON A, NON B HEPATITIS ANTIGENBACXGROUND OF THE INVENTION Since the discovery of hepatitis.B surface antigen HBsAg by Blumberg, Bull. N. Y. Acad. Used. 1964, 40, 377 and of hepatitis A virus HAV Feinstone et al., Science, 1973, 182, 1026, hepatitis types A and B have become distinguishable hy soec fic serological tests. A further type of hepatitis, in which no agent has yet been identified, has been designated non A, non B hepatitis . In the UnitedStates of America, where HBsAg positive donor blood now is excluded from use in transfusions, non A, non B hepatitis accounts for approximately 89 of cases of pnst transfusion hepatitis, Alter et al.,Lancet 2 838 841, 1975, Alter et al., Am. J. Med.Sci., 270 329 334, 1975. Between 5.4 and 18.5 of Americans receivinq five units or less of transfused blood develop non A, non B hepatitis, Alter et al., op. cit. Although the name hepatitis CZ has been proposed for this disease, most clinicians and investigators have continued to refer to it as non A, non B hepatitis because circumstantial evidence suggests that more than one agent may transmit this disease. The diagnosis of non A, non B hepatitis is still based on the exclusion by serologic tests of known etiologic agents HAV and hepatitis B virus HBV , cytomegalovirus, Epstein Barr virus, vrir.ella zoster, or herpes simplex.OBJECTS OF TRE INcENTION It is, accordingly, an object of the present invention to provide a method for the isolation of non A, non B hepatitis antigen. Another object is to provide a method for the detection of non A, non B antigen. A further object is to provide non A, non B hepatitis antigen which has immttnogenic efficacy and may be used as a vaccine against non A, non B hepatitis. Still another object is to provide a composition containing non A, non B hepatitis which has utility as a diagnostic agent. These and other objects of the present invention will be apparent from the following description.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Non A, non B hepatitis antigen having a particle size of from about 2.0 to about 5.0 nm and a density of from about 1.24 to about 1.29 g cc in CsCl. The foregoing antigen is isolated by isopycnic banding and chromatographic fractionation. DERAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENT10N According to the present invention a sample of blood from a patient clinically diagnosed as having non A, non B diagnosis by 1 elevated liver enzymes determined by specific assays used in diagnosing liver disease, 2 possible clinical symptoms including jaundice, and 3 absence of HAV or HBV current active infection as determined by diagnostic assays is converted into serum by standard methods. The serum is then used to screen sera from blood donors to locate serum containing non A, non B antibody. An immunodiffusion assay is used to determine the presence of antibody in a specific serum sample. Once serum containing non A, non B antigen is identified, the serum is subjected to isopycnic banding and fractions of the density aradient are assayed for antigenic activity using the antibody previously located using the immunodiffussion assav.The density gradient may he, for example, CsCl, NaBr, or sucrose. In the case of CsCl the non A, non B hepatitis antigen is found in the region havinq a density of from about 1.24 to about 1.29 g cc. This antigen has a particle size of from about 2 to about 5 nm and is stable between pH 4 and pH 11. Tbis antigen may be a subunit component of large viral like particles of up to about 40 nm which have been observed in higher density regions of from about 1.31 to about 1.34 g cc, and which show the same antigenic characteristics. The density gradient fractions having antigenic activity are pooled and raced on a chromatographic column. Fractions from the column are analyzed using the immunodiffusion assay using previously described antihody, and fractions showing presence of antigen are collected. Antigenicity is found in those fractions having a molecular weight of from about 250,000 to about 1,300,000 daltons.Maximum antigenicity is found in those fractions having a molecular weight of from about 400,000 to about 600,000 daltons. Sodium dodecyl sulfate treated antigen shows a component having a molecular weight of about 50,000 daltons using the western block method, Tobin et al., J. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. Vol. 76, p. 4350 1979 . The fractions may be dialyzed if the antigen is desired in a solvent other than that used to elute the column. The antigen may be inactivated for vaccine use by treatment with formal in at a concentration of from about 1 l,0Q0 to about 1 10,000 for from ahout 24 to about 120 hours, at any temperature. Preferred conditions are a formalin concentration oi about 1 4,000 for about 72 hours at a temperature of from about 33 to about 41 C. The antigen optionally mav be adsorbed on alum to increase its immunogenicity and optionally may be administered in conjunction with other adjuvants. The non A, non B hepatitis antigen of the present invention is immunogenic to susceptible species, e.g., chimpanzees and humans, at dosage level of from about 1 to about 100 ug, preferably from about 5 to about SO ug, and most preferably from about 10 to about 30 Vq. The followina examples illustrate the present invention without, however, limiting the same thereto. EXAMPLE 1 Isolation of Non A, Non B Hepatitis Antigen An individual having clinical symptoms of hepatitis disease as determined by elevated levels of serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase and serum glutamic pyruvate transaminase enzymes, presence of jaundice, and who was determined not to he suffering from ether KAV or HBV by radio immune diagnostic assays, vas bled and the blood converted into serum by known methods. Samples of this serum were used to screen various samples of serum until a serum containing antihody as determined bv the immllnediffllsion assay Abbott rheophoresis plate was located. The serum, 7 ml, containing the non A, non B antigen was placed on a 31 ml CsCl density gradient made up of fivs 6.2 ml quantities of thP following densities of CsCls 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, and 1.6. The density gradient with the serum sample on top was placed in a Beckman SW27 rotor and spun at 25,000 rnm for 16 hours. One ml fractions were taken and dialyzed against water. The fractions were then lyophilized and reconstituted to 200 U1 with i distilled water. The fractions were then assayed for antigenic activity in the immunodiffusion assay using the previously described antibody. Activity was found at a density between 1.24 and 1.29 q cc with a maximum at 1.27. A 10 ml Sepharose CL6B column havinq a length of approximately 25 cm and a diameter of approximately 7 mm was packed by conventibnal methods. A charge, 0.4 ml, of pooled density gradient fractions that had been dialyzed and reconstituted as described in the preceding paragraph were placed on the column. The column was eluted with phosphate buffered saline PBS at approximately 1 ml per 15 minutes and 0.5 ml fractions were collected. These fractions were then lyophilized and reconstituted in distilled water at 100 ul per fraction. The fractions were then analyzed in the tamunodiffusion assay using the previously isolated antibody. The maximum antigenic activity corresponded to those fractions having a molecular weight of approximately 500,000 daltons with activity ranging from 250,000 to 1,300,000 daltons. EXAMPLE 2 Preparation of Non A, Non B Hepatitis Vaccine The material eluted from the Sepharose CL6B column in Example 1 having a molecular weiqht ranging from 250,000 to 1,300,000 daltons is pooled and treated with formalin at a concentration of 1 4,000 for 72 hours at 37iC to inactivate the antigen and provide a material suitable for use as a vaccine EXAMPLE 3 preparation of Alum Adsorbed Vaccine The inactivated product of Example 2 is adsorbed on alum and suspended in phvsiological saline solution buffered at from pH 6.0 to pH 7.8. EXAMPLE 4 The fractions eluted from the SepharoseCL 6B in Example 1 showing antigenic activity are dialyzed against dlstilled water to provide the non A, non B antigen in a composition comprising distilled water. This composition is useful either as a vaccine after inactivation as a..qcrihd inExample 2 or as such or as a diagnostic antigen. EXAMPLE 5 The fractions eluted from the SepharoseCL 6B column in Example 1 which show antigenic activity are dialyzed against saline to provide the non A, non B antigen in a composition comprising saline. This composition is useful either as a vaccine after inactivation as described in Example 2 or as such or as a diaanostic antigen. EXAMPLE 6 Approximately 10 mg of non A, non B hepatitis antigen from the Sepharose CL 6B column was treated with 2 sodium dodecyl sulfate and Ç 2 mercaptoethanol in 5 ml of tris buffer adjusted to pH 6.8 with concentrated HC1. The solution was incubated at 100 C for 3 minutes and 0.5 ml of 50B glycerol and 0.5 bromophenol blue tracking dye were added to the solution. The preparation was applied to a 450 cm column of 12.5 polvacrylamide gel with a 5 stacking gel over it. The gel column was developed with 1.5 liters of tris glvcine soaiuin dodecyl sulfate buffer in an electric field of 100 volts. Development was continued for 15 hours. A pS0,000 daltons molecular weight bxnd was located in the gel by comparison with a coomassie blue stained track run in parallel. The reqion war cut from the gel and eluted with 20 ml of physiological saline 0.18 sodium dodecyl sulfate solution. The sodium dodecyl sulfate solution was rmovçd by extensive dialysis against physiological saline and was ready for formulation into a vaccine.
