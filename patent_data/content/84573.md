# INDUSTRIAL ROBOT CONTROL SYSTEM.

## Abstract
Industrial robot control system in a system having a machine tool MAC , a numerical control unit NCU controll ing the machine tool, an industrial robot RBT , and a robot control unit RCU controlling the robot. In this industrial robot control system, a plurality of NC programs are stored in a memory DMN within the numerical control unit NCU , and a plurality of robot control programs are stored in a memory DMR within the robot control unit RCU , the size and shape of the workpiece is detected by a workpiece discrimination unit WKD to selected the NC program appropriate to the workpiece, and to deliver the number of the robot program appropriate to the NC program from the numerical control unit NCU to the robot control unit RCU , thereby controlling the robot RBT in accordance with the robot program having that number.
