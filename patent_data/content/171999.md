# Fluid spacer composition for use in well cementing.

## Abstract
A fluid spacer composition for use in well cementing comprises an aqueous fluid and an admixture of nonylphe nols. Optionally, but preferably, there will also be at least one member selected from the group of a sulfonated linear C₈ to C₁₈ straight chain alcohol ethoxylated with an average of from about 2 to about 20 moles of ethylene oxide,a low molecular weight aliphatic glycol ether containing from about 3 to about 12 carbon atoms and an alcohol containing from about 3 to about 8 carbon atoms ethoxylated with an average of 2 to 4 moles of ethylene oxide.
