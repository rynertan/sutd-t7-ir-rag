# Master slice type semiconductor integrated circuit device.

## Abstract
A master slice type semiconductor integrated circuit device 1 including a plurality of basic cells 22 , each having at least one logical circuit element, and a plurality of current source cells 24 for supplying current to the basic cells, each having at least one current source element and arranged separate from the basic cells. A logic circuit is formed by operatively connecting at least one logical circuit element in the basic cell and at least one current source element in the current source cell. This arrangement provides increased flexibility in the supply of power to each basic cell according to its purpose.
