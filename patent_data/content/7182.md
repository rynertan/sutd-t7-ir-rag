# Stabilized polymers, novel stabilizers and synthesis thereof.

## Abstract
Novel α aminoacetamides are powerful stabilizers for organic materials subject to oxygen and heat degradation, and particularly for synthetic natural rubber and synthetic ester lubricants. A wide range of substituents on the amine and amide N atoms, and also on the saturated carbon atoms, yields an array of stabilizers having a wide range of compati bility in compositions comprising various synthetic resinous compounds to be stabilized. Novel synthesis is provided utilizing at least one amine nucleophilic agent, a dichlorocarbene ion generating agent, and an alkoxide ion generating agent, which together in the presence of aqueous alkali and an onium salt, yield novel α aminoacetamides in which a wide choice of substituents may be introduced. The nucleophilic agent may be a primary or secondary amine, or one of each. The dichlorocarbene ion generating agent is haloform. The alkoxide ion generating agent may be a ketone, an aldehyde, or a cyanohydrin which reacts with the haloform. An α trihalomethyl alcohol also reacts with the amine nucleophilic agent, without the benefit of a dichlorocarbene ion generating agent. When the alkoxide ion generating agent is an α trihalomethyl alcohol, an α hydrogen may optionally be substituted.
