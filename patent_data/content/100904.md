# Improved protocol for the treatment of graft versus host disease.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a monoclonal antibody known as TA 1 directed against human T cells and which is covalently linked to the toxin ricin and used to treat human donor bone marrow before the marrow is infused into a human recipient. Additionally, monoclonal antibodies known as TA 1, T101, and UCHT1 covalently linked to separate ricin toxins, are combined in a mixture and used in an improved protocol in the treatment of human donor bone marrow prior to the infusion of the marrow into a human recipient.
