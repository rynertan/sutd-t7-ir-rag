# Method for the purification of LPF HA.

## Abstract
Described is a method for producing highly pure LPF HA Leucocytosis promoting Factor Hemagglutinin from culture media of Bordetella pertussis in a high yield by an affinity chromatography using a denatured ceruloplasmin as a ligand. The LPF HA obtained by this invention is highly pure and contains almost no endotoxin of B. pertussis and is useful for the preparation of various reagents utilizing the physiological activities, of a medicine for treating diabetes and of a pertussis vaccine.
