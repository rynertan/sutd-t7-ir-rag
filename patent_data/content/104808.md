# Closed liquid container and method of fabrication.

## Abstract
A polymer mixture is extruded into a tubular configura tion which is cut to the desired length. One end of the tubular member 40 is framed by a support member 42 and a portion 50 of the end of the tube folds over the support member 42 . A flat end piece section 52 is placed over the thus formed end assembly which is then positioned so that the sealing end surface 52 of the assembly is supported on the upper face of a support fixture 54 . The fixture 54 moves to a sealing area C where an induction heater 72 hot seals the flat end piece 52 to the end of the tubular member 40 . The support member 42 is moved within the tubular member 40 to the other end of the tubular member 40 and the previous steps are repeated to seal the other end with a flat end piece section 80 having a fill opening 82 . The internal support member 42 can be disassembled and the pieces removed througn the fill opening 82 of the container 30 formed.
