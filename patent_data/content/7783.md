## Abstract
A control system to prevent the accumulation of exces sive cellular material in a fluidized bed reactor 10 wherein a waste liquid to be processed is conducted upwardly at a veloc ity conducive to fluidization through a bed of particles 14 which function as a carrier for the growth of the material. The system includes a separator column 17 whose lower end section extends toward the fluidized bed and whose upper end section extends above a head of liquid effluent which lies on the bed, or is sealed and located below the surface of liquid effluent. In the course of reactor operation, the cellular mater ial on the particles continues to grow, causing the bed to expand upwardly. An agitator arrangement 18,19,20 associ ated with the separator effects shearing of the excess cellular material from the particles to produce in the separator column a mixture of sheared material and partially stripped carrier particles. The separator column is provided with a draw off port 21 somewhat below the surface of the effluent head, the exit flow rate at the draw off port being adjusted so that the resultant upward flow velocity in the separator column is lower than the settling velocity of the carrier particles in the mixture but higher than that of the sheared material. As a consequence, the sheared material is washed away through the draw off port, whereas the partially stripped carrier parti cles fall back into the fluidized bed.

## Description
EXCESS GROWTH CONTROL SYSTEM FOR FLUIDIZEDBED REACTOR This invention relates generally to a fluidizedbed reactor in which waste water or other liquid to be processed is conducted upwardly through a bed of small carrier particles which in the course of operation are enlarged by the growth of cellular material thereon, and more particularly to a system for controlling the accumulation of such material in a fluidized bed reactor to prevent excessive growth thereof. The invention will be described in connection with reactors for extracting nitrogen compounds such as nitrate or ammonia from waste water by means of a fluidized bed of solid particles serving as carriers for micro organisms grown thereon. These reactors are preferably of the type disclosed in the U.S. Patent 3,846,289 and U.S. Patent 4,009,099, whose entire disclosures are incorporated herein by reference. It is to be understood, however, that a system in accordance with the invention is also applicable to other forms of fluidized bed reactors in which the need exists to control the build up of bacteria and other types of cellular material on the carrier particles to prevent excessive growth thereof. Thus the invention is useful in connection with the fluidized bed reactors of the type disclosed in U.S. Patents 4,032,407, 4,009,098 and 4,009,105. It is now recognised that the existence of nitrogen compounds in waste water represents a serious threat to ecological balances existing in nature. Accelerated eutrophication of lakes and streams is often caused by feeding conventionally treated waste effluent into surface waters. While such treatment is designed to remove solids and oxygen demanding organic material, they do not extract from these wastes the substantial quantities of ammonia and nitrate ions which are contained therein and which promote the production of algae. Aside from being a major nutrient to algae growth, nitrogen in the form of ammonia is toxic to aquatic life and can react with a chlorine disinfectant to form chloramines which are carcinogenic. Hence there is a need for waste water treatment that effects almost complete denitrification that is, the conversion of nitrate or nitrite compounds to non polluting elemental nitrogen gas prior to the release of the wastes to surface waters. The fluidized bed reactors disclosed in the aboveidentified U.S. Patents accomplish denitrification by a biological process in which bacteria act to reduce nitrite or nitrate constituents in the influent waste stream into harmless nitrogen gas. This process is carried out in a fluidized bed reactor in which the waste water to be treated passes upwardly through a bed of small particles, such as activated carbon or sand, at a velocity sufficient to cause motion or fluidization of all of the medium which then functions as a carrier or support surface for the growth of bacteria. The use of small sand or other particles provides a vast surface area on which the bacteria can flourish and grow, thereby making it possible to remove a considerable amount of contaminants from the waste water in a relatively small reactor volume. Fluidization of the medium augments the effective surface area, compared to that of packed beds, and it minimizes operational problems such as the clogging and head loss encountered in packed beds. As waste water containing nitrogen in the form of ammonia or nitrate is passed through a fluidized bed, bacterial growth is accelerated and the size of the particles undergoes enlargement. If this growth is unchecked, the bed particles become enlarged to a degree resulting in agglomeration, thereby reducing the biological surface area per unit volume of the reactor and the efficiency of the reactor column. Moreover, as the particles swell, they are reduced in specific gravity and thereby acquire a tendency to float and to be carried away from the bed. Also, when the particles are excessively enlarged, they are prone to entrap or become attached to gas bubbles. This further reduces the specific gravity of the particles and the tendency of the particles to be carried away from the bed. The primary concern of the present invention is with the removal of excess cellular material or bacterial growth on the particles of a fluidized bed reactor in the course of operation, thereby obviating the tendency of the particles to be carried away in the process effluent.The term excess cellular material as used herein refers to the amount of material attached to the particulate carried beyond that needed for the normal operating of the reactor. In a fluidized bed reactor for denitrification, sufficient growth in the form of a thin layer of bacteria must be retained on the particles in order to maintain the efficiency of the process. Hence a system which so abrades or shears the particles as to remove all bacterial growth is destructive of the process. Another concern of the invention is with the control of the thickness of the bio mass layer on the carrier particles so that an optimum film thickness can be maintained in the biological reactor. Various techniques have heretofore been proposed to prevent the accumulation of excess cellular material on the carrier particles in a fluidized bed reactor.One such technique is disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,009,099 wherein the bacterial growth on the particles is monitored as a function of bed expansion. This is accomplished by an optical device or other form of solids sensor, such that when bed expansion reaches a given height to activate the sensor, the bed particles are regenerated by abrasion to remove excessive cellular material. This is effected mechanically by a stirrer at the top of the column in the form of sharp rotating blades or other means. The partially stripped carrier particles acted upon by the stirrer settle back into the fluidized bed, whereas the sheared off excess cellular material which has greater buoyancy than the carrier particles is carried away in the effluent process stream. Since in this prior arrangement, the output of the reactor includes the excess cellular material, it is necessary to use a clarifier or other solids separation means to remove the sheared solids from the process effluent. Another approach heretofore taken to control the production of sludge is to permit the growth covered particles to flow out with the process effluent into a settling tank which separates these particles from the process effluent. The excess growth is then mechanically sheared from the carrier particles, and the mixture of sheared sludge and particles is returned to the fluidized bed. In this technique, a clarifier or other solids separation unit must be used in conjunction with the settling tank to remove the sheared sludge from the process effluent. Alternatively, the sheared growth can be separated from the carrier particles in the return path between the settling tank and the fluidized bed, thereby eliminating the need for a clarifier in the output of the reactor, but requiring instead a separator unit in the return path. Still another effective approach in current use for removing excess sludge is by means of a vibrating screen. In this technique, the growth covered particles are pumped from the fluidized bed to the vibrating screen, the pumping action serving to agitate the particles and to shear excess growth therefrom and the vibrating screen functioning to separate the sheared growth from the carrier particles. These particles are then returned to the fluidized bed, whereas the sheared growth is wasted. Alternatively, shearing may be effected by means other than a pump. The use of a vibrating screen in a growth control system has one important advantage, for it obviates the need for a clarifier in the output of the reactor. On the other hand, a vibrating screen is subject to plugging, and this dictates the use of a washing spray to keep the screen free. This is a serious drawback for the spray dilutes the concentration of the waste sludge which must be further processed. Moreover, during the operation of a vibrating screen, some sheared solids remain loosely attached to the carrier particles, and when the carrier particles are returned to the fluidized bed, these solids are brought along and escape into the process effluent, thereby degrading the quality of the effluent when the screen is operative. Furthermore, a vibrating screen, which is a fairly expensive and sophisticated unit, has inherent practical limitations with respect to the amount of liquid it can handle. In calculating the overall cost of installing and operating an excess growth control system, one must not only take into account the amount of energy that is necessary to shear excess growth from the carrier particles but also the fact that this shearing action directly affects the dewaterability of the resultant sludge. In order to dispose of this sludge, it must first be dewatered. If, for example, the abrading technique for shearing the growth tends to dissect the sludge into fine pieces which are then suspended in the water and are slow to settle, dewatering becomes more difficult. The nature of the pollutant being removed from the liquid and the type of fluidized bed process employed for this purpose determines the type of biological organisrrswhich predominate in the treatment system therefor.For a given system, there is an optimum amount of energy which must be imparted to the excess growth shearing means to attain the most dewaterable sludge. Inasmuch as the handling and disposal of the sludge in a biological treatment facility can represent a substantial percentage of the overall cost of treatment, running as high as 40 , the dewaterability of the excess sludge production directly affects this cost and cannot, therefore, be disregarded for the more easily dewaterable the sludge, the less expensive is the slud e handling procedure. Thus while various techniques and systems based thereon have heretofore been provided to control excess growth in a fluidized bed reactor, all of these known techniques have entailed clarifiers and other expedients which add substantially to the cost of installing and operating the control systems in a manner yielding an effluent free of sheared material. The present invention provides a control system for preventing accumulation of excessive cellular material in a fluidized bed reactor wherein waste water or other liquid to be processed is conducted upwardly therein at a speed conducive to fluidization through a bed of particles which function as a carrier for the growth of the material, a head of effluent being developed above the bed from which the effluent is discharged from the reactor, the control system being characterized by a separator column positioned at least partially within the effluent head with its lower end extending towards or into the fluidized bed, said column having a draw off port from a position below the surface of the effluent head and means associated with said column to effect shearing of the excess cellular material from the particles to produce in the column a mixture of sheared material and partially stripped carrier particles, whereby the partially stripped particles are returned to the bed while the sheared material is discharged from the column through the draw off port. The system of the invention can be made highly efficient, operationally size and relatively inexpensive.The energy required to shear growth from the carrier particles can be governed to produce a sludge having optimum dewaterability characteristics. The system exploits the difference in the settling velocities of partially stripped carrier particles and the excess growth sheared therefrom. As the head of effluent is developed above the bed, the clarified effluent can be discharged from the reactor through a clear effluent port. In some embodiments of the invention the column is an open ended separator column whose lower end extends into the fluidized bed reactor and whose upper end extends above the effluent head. In the course of reactor operation, the cellular material on the particles continues to build up, causing the bed to expand until its level 4 ts e reaches an alarm point indicative of excessive growth.This alarm point is sensed to activate an agitator arrangement which effects shearing of the excess growth from the carrier particles to generate in the separation column a mixture of sheared material and partially strippeQ carrier particles. The separator column is provided with a draw off port somewhat below the surface of the effluent head.The exit flow rate through the draw off port may be adjusted to ensure that the upward flow velocity in the separator column is lower than the settling velocity of the carrier particles in the mixture, but higher than that of the sheared material. As a consequence, the sheared material is washed away through the draw off port, whereas the partially stripped carrier particles fall back into the fluidized bed. This excess growth removal continues until the level of the bed falls to a predetermined safety point below the alarm point when the activity is discontinued to complete the cycle which is not repeated until the bed again expands to reach the alarm point. Because the sheared growth is confined to the separator column before being drawn off, none of this material can enter the process effluent stream hence no need exists for a clarifier in the output line of the fluidized bed reactor as in prior control systems to provide a clear effluent. In one embodiment, the concentration of the waste sludge emitted from the drawoff port can advantageously be controlled simply by adjusting the exit flow rate from the port. And the amount of energy imparted to the growth shearing activity can be controlled so that optimum sludge dewaterability is obtainable for a given set of operating conditions. Preferred embodiments of the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein Fig. 1 schematically illustrates a known form of fluidized bed reactor operating in conjunction with one preferred embodiment of an excess growth control system in accordance with the invention, the system being shown at the point where its operating cycle is initiated Fig. 2 shows the same control system at an intermediate point in the cycle Fig. 3 shows the same control system at the completion of its operating cycle Fig. 4 shows a second embodiment of a control system in accordance with the invention Fig. 5 illustrates a third embodiment of the control system Fig. 6 illustrates a fourth embodiment of the invention Fig. 7 illustrates a fifth embodiment of the invention Figure 8 illustrates a feature of the invention to be used in combination with the third, fourth and fifth embodiments Fig. 9 illustrates a sixth embodiment of the invention in which the entire separator column is located in the head or clear zone above the fluidized bed Fig. 10 illustrates a seventh embodiment of the invention Fig. 11 illustrates an eighth embodiment of the invention Fig. 12 schematically illustrates a known form of fluidized bed reactor operating in conjunction with an excess growth control system having a separator column in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention Fig. 13 schematically illustrates a modified version of the separator column of Fig. 12 and Fig. 14 illustrates a further embodiment of, the separator column. Since an excess growth control system in accordance with the invention is usable with any known form of fluidized bed reactor such as the reactor disclosed inU.S. patent 4,009,099, the reactor structure and its operation will only be briefly outlined. As shown in Fig. 1, waste water or other liquid to be processed is introduced into the cylindrical column 10 of the reactor through a valve 11 and inlet pipe 12 feeding the liquid into the lower portion of the column through a manifold 13. Micro organisms or biota seeded bed particles of sand or other particular material are fluidized by the passage of the waste water at an appropriate velocity through the reactor column to create a fluidized bed 14. Developed above the fluidized bed 14 is an effluent head 15 whose level is fixed by a clear effluent discharge port 16 adjacent the upper end of the reactor.In the course of reactor operation, the cellular material on the particles continues to grow, causing fluidized bed 14 to expand upwardly, this expansion being accompanied by the concurrent contraction of the effluent head 15. Associated with the fluidized bed reactor is a control system to prevent the accumulation of excessive cellular material, the control system including a relatively small, open ended separator column 17 immersed in effluent head 15, the low end of the separator column extending into the fluidized bed and the upper end thereof extending above the effluent head. At a point somewhat below the surface of effluent head 15, separator column 17 is provided with a drawoff port 21 which feeds sheared material washed out of the column into a dewatering unit 22 through a valve 23. This valve is closed when the control system is inactive. Supported on an axle 18 within the lower portion of the separator column is a mixing blade 19 driven by an external motor 20. As the fluidized bed 14 expands upwardly, its level reaches an alarm point AP indicative of excess cellular material, which condition is detected by a level or solids sensor 24. This sensor may be in electrooptical or any other suitable form adapted to produce a signal when alarm point AP is reached. The signal from sensor 24 serves to simultaneously activate mixing motor 20 and to open valve 23 by means of an electronic control unit 25 responsive thereto. In lieu of such automatic control, sensor 24 may be used simply to actuate an alarm pilot light to advise an operator to manually switch on motor 20 and to open valve 23. Or if in a given installation the rate of growth is fairly uniform, the mixing motor 20 and valve 23 of the system may be operated automatically by a timer mechanism. Mixing blade 19 functions as an agitator or stirrer to shear the coated particles within the lower end portion of the separator column 17 and to generate in the separator column a mixture of sheared material and partially stripped carrier particles. The extent of shearing is determined by the rotary speed of mixing blade 19, this rate being adjustable to afford the optimum degree of shear for the growth. As the speed of the mixing motor is advanced, this produces increased agitation and turbulence within the separator column, resulting not only in an enhanced shearing force but also in greater pulverization of the sheared cellular material. Since excessive pulverization of the sheared material adversely affects the dewaterability of this material in dewatering unit 22, an electrooptical particle size sensor 26 may be installed in dewatering unit 22 to provide a signal indicative of the dewaterability index of the pulverized cellular material fed therein. This index signal is applied to electronic control unit 25 to adjust the speed of motor 20 to an extent maintaining a desired degree of dewaterability. For this purpose, electronic control unit 25 may include a microprocessor programmed to analyze the index signal from sensor 26 and to provide an output signal for effecting the appropriate control of the mixing motor speed. The upward flow velocity through separator column 17 is determined by the exit flow rate from draw off port 22 as set by adjustment of valve 23. This exit flow rate is set so that the upward flow velocity in the separator column is higher than the downward settling velocity of the sheared growth, but lower than the downward settling velocity of the partially stripped carrier particles. As a consequence, the sheared cellular material is forced upwardly in the separator column and washed away through draw off port 21 into the dewatering unit 22, whereas the carrier particles in the mixture fall back into the fluidized bed. In this action, the specific gravity of the coated particles is increased when most of the relatively light cellular growth attached thereto is sheared off. In addition, by adjusting valve 23, the concentration of the waste sludge can be controlled. As this activity continues, the size of the particles in the fluidized bed is diminished and the level of the bed, as shown in Fig. 2, gradually drops until a safety point SP is reached, this condition being sensed by a suitable level sensor 27. Sensor 27 generates a signal indicative of this condition which is applied to electronic control unit 25 to deactivate mixer motor 20 and to turn off valve 23, as shown inFig. 3,thereby completing the excess growth removal cycle. This cycle is not repeated until the level of the fluidized bed 14 again rises as a result of cellular growth, to reach alarm point AP. In the embodiment shown in Fig. 4, the agitation arrangement associated with separator column 17 disposed in reactor 10 to effect shearing takes the form of sonic, ultrasonic or infrasonic transducer 28 adapted to impart the necessary shearing force to the coated particles, rather than a mixing blade as in the first embodiment. The transducer for this purpose may. be of the type in commercial use for degreasing metal surfaces.However, in the present case, the sonic energy must be such as not to carry out complete removal of the cellular material from the particles but to effect only partial stripping thereof in order not to impair the biological process. Enhanced results may be obtained by extending the low end of separator column 17 more deeply into fluidized bed 14 or by attaching a conical funnel 17A to the low end of the column to provide extra washing of the sheared growth away from the partially stripped carrier particles. Alternately, as shown in Fig. 5, the shearing of the cellular growth need not take place within separator column 17 but external to the reactor by means of a loop 29 which includes a pump 30 to draw the coated particles from the column at a point adjacent its low end and to return the particles to the column at a higher point, the pump action providing the necessary agitation or stirring of the particles to effect shearing thereof. The embodiment shown in Fig. 6 is the same as that in Fig. 5, except that loop 29 associated with separator column 17 further includes a line static mixer 30A to augment the shearing action produced by the pump. The fifth embodiment shown in Fig. 7 is essentially the same as that shown in Fig. 5, except that loop 29 associated with separator column 17 is designed to effect hydraulic shear of the excess growth. This may be carried out by section 29A of the loop which affords a constricted or sinuous flow path through which flow is at a high velocity to create sufficient turbulence to produce a shearing action. In Fig. 8, there is shown a feature that is usable in conjunction with the third, fourth and fifth embodiments of the invention, the growth control system in this instance including a valve 31 in loop 29.Also included is an auxiliary loop 33 having a valve 32 therein and extending between the head or clear zone 15 above the fluidized bed and the section of main loop 29 between valve 31 and pump 30, the auxiliary loop acting to feed clear effluent into the main loop. When alarm point AP is reached, the sensor detecting this point in the control system serves not only to open valve 23 in the draw off port 21 of the separator column, but also functions to open valve 31 in the main loop 29 to initiate a shearing action, valve 32 in the auxiliary loop remaining closed during this operation. When, however, the level of the fluidized bed is reduced by the shearing action to the level of safety point SP, the sensor detecting this point acts to close valve 31 and to open valve 32 in order to feed clear effluent into separator column 17 while pump 30 is kept open, this action serving to flush out the pump and the line to free them of contaminants. This flushing action is continued for a few minutes or as long as is necessary until the system is cleansed, after which the entire system is automatically de activated and remains in this state until the build up of cellular material elevates the level of the fluidized bed to re activate the growth control system. In the sixth embodiment shown in Fig. 9, the separator column 17 extended into the clear zone or effluent head 15 above fluidized bed 14 has its lower end spaced from the bed rather than immersed therein as in the previous embodiments. In this arrangement, pump 30 in loop 29 serves to deliver fluidized bed particles to separator column 17, shearing of the bio mass being effected by any of the means previously disclosed. The flow rate of sludge exiting separator column 17 through valve 23 must, in this instance, not be significantly lower than the rate of flow at which transfer pump 30 brings the material into the separator column for otherwise, the sheared growth will back up into the process effluent. While this results in the loss of some flexibility in controlling the concentration of the waste sludge, it has the advantage of simplifying the construction of the separator column in those situations where the clear zone 15 above the fluidized bed is relatively high. The seventh embodiment illustrated in Fig. 10 is essentially the same as that in Fig. 9, save that a recirculation pump 33 is added to an auxiliary loop 36 extending between the upper end of main loop 29 and a point in column 17 adjacent the lower end thereof, the recirculation pump serving to augment the shearing action produced by transfer pump 30. In the eighth embodiment illustrated in Fig. 11, the lower end of separator column 17 in the effluent head 15 is again above the level of the fluidized bed 14. In this arrangement, a small vertical pipe 34 is projected down from the lower end of column 17 into the fluidized bed itself. Compressed air from a source 37 is fed into pipe 34 through a lower end port 35 therein, the rising air causing the media to flow into separator column 17 and at the same time providing the necessary shearing action. This shearing action within the column can be augmented by mixing motor 20 as arranged in the first embodiment. Various other modifications of the above embodiments are envisaged. Thus is in the event the reactor is subject to diurnal flow which brings about variations in the depth of the fluidized bed in the course of the day, the arrangement may be made such that the growth control system is maintained in a quiescent condition except for those periods when excess bed expansion occurs. Or the operations initiated by the alarm point and the safety point sensors may be modified to take into account diurnal variations.Alternatively, one can operate the growth control system continuously rather than intermittently, in which case the rate of growth control is made such as to remove excess growth at about the same rate as growth takes place, so that growth control is never interrupted and the level of the fluidized bed is never permitted to undergo more thank slight expansion. One practical difficulty experienced with the systems of Figs. 1 to 11 is that the operating range of liquid velocity through the separator column is limited. If, therefore, in a given installation, the upward velocity is slightly higher than a predetermined acceptable level, the sand or carrier particles which have been partially sheared may be carried out with the sheared material and pass through the sludge discharge port instead of settling back into the bed. On the other hand, if the liquid velocity is slightly lower than the predetermined acceptable level, the sludge may back up into the fluidized bed reactor.Since the optimum velocity may vary from plant to plant, this factor creates difficulties in designing the unit for different bacterial processes. To avoid these difficulties, the shape of the separator column may be modified as shown in Figs. 12 to 14. The control system of Fig. 12 includes a relatively small, open ended separator column 40 immersed in effluent head 15, the lower end section C of the separator column extending into the fluidized bed 14 and the upper end section A thereof extending above the effluent head. At a point somewhat below the surface of effluent head 15, separator column 40 is provided with a drawoff port 21 which feeds sheared material washed out of the column into a dewatering unit through a valve 23 at a flow Q1. This valve is closed when the control system is inactive. Shearing of the cellular growth is carried out by means of a loop 29 which includes a pump 30 that acts to draw the coated particles at a liquid flow Q2 from the column at an intermediate point therein and to return the particles to the column at a higher point, the pump action providing the necessary agitation or stirring of the particles to effect shearing thereof. As the fluidized bed expands upwardly, its level reaches an alarm point indicative of excess cellular material, which condition is detected by a level or solids sensor as in the embodiments described above.This sensor may be an electro optical or any other suitable form adapted to produce a signal when the alarm point is reached. The signal from the sensor serves to simultaneously activate pump 30 and to open valve 23 by means of an electronic control unit response thereto. The upward flow velocity through column 40 is determined by the exit flow rate Q1 from the draw off port 21 as set by adjustment of valve 23. In practice, valve 23 may take the form of a controllable pump to adjust this rate to an optimum value. This exit flow rate is set so that the upward flow velocity in the separator column is higher than the downward settling velocity of the sheared growth, but lower than the downward settling velocity of the partially stripped carrier particles. As a consequence, the sheared cellular material is forced upwardly in the separator column and washed away through draw off port 21 into a dewatering unit, whereas the carrier particles in the mixture fall back into the fluidized bed. In this action, the specific gravity of the coated particles is increased when most of the relatively light cellular growth attached thereto is sheared off.In addition, by adjusting valve 23 the concentration of the waste sludge can be controlled. As this activity continues, the size of the particles in the fluidized bed is diminished and the level of the bed gradually drops until a safety point is reached, this condition being sensed by a suitable level sensor which generates a signal indicative of this condition, this signal being applied to the electronic control unit to deactivate shearing pump 30 and to turn off valve 21, thereby completing the excess growth removal cycle. As pointed out previously, the problem with separator columns of the types disclosed in the copending application in which the columns are of uniform diameter throughout its length except in some instances at the inlet section, is that the control systems are not capable of operating throughout a broad range of liquid velocities. Hence if the liquid velocity is slightly higher in the column than the desired value, bed particles or sand may be carried out in the sludge discharge, whereas if the velocity is slightly below the desired value, sludge may back up into the reactor. To overcome this drawback, separator column 40 shown in Fig. 12 has three distinct sections A,B andC, the upper end section A having a relatively large diameter the intermediate section having a smaller diameter, and the lower end section which extends into the fluidized bed having the smallest diameter. It will be noted that the loop 29, which includes shearing pump 30, has its inlet going in intermediate section B and its outlet feeding upper end section A. We shall assume that the intermediate section B is dimensioned for optimum liquid velocity so that the diameter of this section would be the same as a separator column of uniform diameter of the types disclosed inFigs. 1 to 11. If now a condition arises, where the liquid velocity becomes slightly higher than the desired value in section B, sand still could not escape from the separator column because the liquid velocity is immediately reduced in the section A thereabove.Conversely, if the liquid velocity is slightly lower than the desired level in section B, it will be higher in lower section C, and this will prevent sludge from flowing back into the reactor. Thus intermediate section B functions as a sludge concentration section, section A thereabove as the sand safety section, and section C therebelow as the sludge back up safety section. In this way, the effective operating range is extended and one is able to design the unit for various bacterial processes without danger that in different installations, there will be either sand withdrawal that would deprive the fluidized bed of material or sludge back up that would contaminate the effluent of the system. In the arrangement shown in Fig. 13, the separator column 41, instead of being in a stepped formation, as in the case of Fig. 12 with distinct sections, has a conical formation hence its diameter progressively increases from the lower end to the upper end thereof. Concentration of sludge takes place in the midportion of the cone. With this conical formation, the level at which the material is abraded to separate the excess growth from the fluidized bed particles can be set for optimal conditions, thereby affording maximum waste sludge concentration. In terms of producing the maximum sludge concentration, the unit shown in Fig. 14 is the most preferred embodimentIn this unit, the separator column 42 has an upper end section A of large diameter and a lower end section C of relatively small diameter, there being no intermediate section as in Fig. 12. Instead of an intermediate section, the unit is provided with a concentrator section B in a funnel formation which is immersed in the fluidized bed. In practice, the concentrator section may be attached to the interior wall of reactor 10 and resembles a weir or trough. When the growth control system is not activated, solenoid valve 43 remains open allowing the fluidized bed particles to circulate freely through the funnel.When valve 43 is closed, the contents of the funnel are pumped through line 44 by shearing pump 45 into sectionA of the separator column 42. It should be noted that the funnel could be located in the effluent head and lowered into the bed when needed rather than using a fixed funnel with the solenoid valve. The function of concentrator section B is to allow the fluidized bed particles which rise above its mouth to settle into it. When the control system is activated, the material settled in concentrator section B is then pumped into the separator column. This results in a significantly higher sludge concentration that is achievable by abrading the material in the fluidized state. Valve 43 in the output end of concentrator sectionB remains open when the growth control system is not in operation. This permits fluidized bed particles to travel freely through the concentrator section until the growth control system is activated. When, however, the system is activated, solenoid valve 43 is caused to close, thereby permitting fluidized bed particles to settle in the concentrator section B, from which point they are pumped by shearing pump 45 into the upper sectionA of separator column 42. Thus solenoid valve 21 acts to prevent the media in the reactor from packing in the concentrator section when the separator column is not in operation. The flow rate Q1 must always be maintained slightly higher than or equal to flow rate Q2 determined by pump 45 at which the sand to be sheared is pumped into section A, or else sludge will back up into the unit.Hence this arrangement is somewhat more difficult to control than the embodiments in Figs. 12 and 13. In the embodiments shown in Figs. 12 and 13, the open upper end of the separator column is above the surface of the effluent head. In practice, however, the upper end of the columns may be sealed by caps and submerged below the surface, as in Fig. 14, this making possible a more compact separator and one which is easier to support. Also, while the system has been described in conjunction with a fluidized bed reactor, it is usable also with an expanded bed and or moving bed systems. In the embodiment in Fig. 14, the concentrator section B may be provided with a density sensor not shown to ensure a thick sludge, the sensor acting to activate pump 45 in the agitator arrangement only when the sludge attains a predetermined thickness. In the embodiment of Figs. 12 and 14, the separator columns have a stepped formation. In practice, it may be desirable to provide a taper rather than an abrupt transition between sections of the column so that growth will not then tend to build up on the step ledges and become anaerobic. A taper angle of 300 is sufficient to eliminate solids deposition.
