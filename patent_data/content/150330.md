# STORAGE STABLE, ONE PACKAGE, HEAT CURABLE POLY UREA URETHANE COATING COMPOSITIONS

## Abstract
New and improved storage stable, one package, heat curable poly urea urethane coating compositions are dis closed which comprise a a mixture or prepolymer of i a poly aliphatic isocyanate compound of the for mula The compositions cure when heated to above about 100 C to form coatings which exhibit good abrasion resis tance, solvent resistance, weather resistance and good ad hesion to a wide variety of substrates. The coating com positions are stable upon storage for several months and have useful coating lives in the presence of atmospheric moisture of up to several days. In a preferred embodiment the new and improved poly urea urethane coating compositions comprises a pre polymer solution containing a prepolymer derived from α,α,α ,α tetramethylxylyene diisocyanate and 9 amino 10 hydroxystearylamine having a solids content of from about 30 by weight to about 80 by weight and an isocyanate content of from about 2 by weight to about 10 by weight, based on the total weight of the solution, and a minor effec tive amount of a dibutyltin dilaurate catalyst.
