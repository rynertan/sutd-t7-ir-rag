# Polychromatic image sensor.

## Abstract
A sensor has a light receiving surface provided with a film 20 of silicon oxide, and beneath said film a region 21 of P type semiconductor material. A plurality of regions 22,23 of N type semiconductor material form with the region 21 respective PN junctions 27,28 whose distance from the light receiving surface varies continuously across or along the latter. Since the penetration of light into the regions 21, 22 and 23 will depend upon wavelength, the PH junction 27 and 28 will provide different characteristics for different light wavelengths. The regions 22,23 may be disposed along a straight line, in which case the distance between the PN junctions and the light receiving surface can vary linearly along said line. Alternatively the PN junctions can be disposed on an arcuate surface so that their distance from the light receiving surface varies non linearly along said surfaces.
