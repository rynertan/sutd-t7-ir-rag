# Gyroscopic devices.

## Abstract
A gyroscopic device comprising a resonator in the form of a disc 1 , cylinder 30 or like structure of circular outline, of a composition containing piezo electric material and preferably made of a unitary mass of such material. The re sonator is excited into dilatation type vibration by electric currents applied to exciting electrodes 5 8 electro deposited in a regular pattern around the circumference of the structure, and these vibrations are sensed by detecting electrodes 9 12 similarly deposited around the wall in a similar but angularly displaced pattern. A measure of any rate of turn which the structure is undergoing about its axis can be derived from the resulting phase shift of the electrical output from the detecting electrodes.
