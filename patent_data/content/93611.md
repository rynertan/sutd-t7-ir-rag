## Description
COMPOSITE PLASMID The present invention relates to a composite plasmid, and particularly relates to a composite plasmid which is capable of propagating in Coryneform glutamic acid producing bacteria. Coryneform glutamic acid producing bacteria belong to so called Coryneform bacteria are known to produce high amounts of L glutamic acid. There are mutants of Coryneform glutamic acid producing bacteria which produce other amino acids such as lysine purine nucleotides such as inosine 5 monophosphate, and other important fermentation products. Therefore,Coryneform glutamic acid producing bacteria are of great importance to the fermentation industry. The recently developed gene splicing techniques can successfully be applied for breeding or improving industrial microorganisms, expecially in case ofEscherichia coli. It has been difficult, however, to apply the gene splicing techniques for breeding or improving industrial microorganisms of Coryneform glutamic acid producing bacteria, since suitable plasmid vectors useful for construction of such industrial microorganisms of Coryneform bacterial have not yet been developed. Although several plasmids capable of propagating in Coryneform glutamic acid producing bacteria have been found in Coryneform glutamic acid producing bacteria, these plasmids have no inheritable characteristics which can be used as markers for easy identification. It is therefore still difficult to apply gene splicing techniques for breeding or improving industrial microorganisms of Coryneform glutamic acidproducing bacteria, even if multicopy plasmids isolated from the Coryneform glutamic acid producing bacteria are used as the vectors. A need, therefore, continues to exist for construction and development of a novel plasmid or vector useful for breeding or improving industrial microorganisms of Coryneform glutamic acid producing bacteria. In particular, a need exists to improve the characteristics of natural plasmids separated from Coryneform glutamic acid producing bacteria to make them useful for construction of industrial microorganisms of Coryneform glutamic acid producing bacteria by gene splicing techniques. According to the present invention there is provided a composite plasmid which comprises A a drive unit region derived from a plasmid a capable of propagating in a Coryneform glutamic acid producing bacterium, and B a gene fragment or fragments derived from a plasmid b capable of propagating in Escherichia coli or Bacillus subtilis and having at least a region to express resistance to a drug. When the gene fragment additionally carries a drive unit region of plasmid b , the composite plasmid becomes capable of propagating in Escherichia coli or Bacillus subtilis, and thus it can be screened or amplified in Escherichia coli or Bacillus subtilis. The composite plasmid may carry in addition a gene or genes foreign to the Coryneform glutamic acidproducing bacterium. The composite plasmid may carry in addition a gene or genes from chromosone, plasmid. or phage DNA of Coryneform glutamic acid producing bacterium. In the following description, reference will be made, by way of example, to the drawings, in which FIGURE 1 shows a restriction map of plasmid pAM 330 FIGURE 2 shows a restriction map of plasmid pAM 286 FIGURE 3 shows a restriction map of plasmid pHM 1519 FIGURE 4 shows a restriction map of composite plasmid pAJ 655 FIGURE shows a restriction map of composite plasmid pAJ 611 FIGURE 6 shows a restriction map of composite plasmid pAJ 1844 FIGURE 7 shows a restriction map of composite plasmid pAJ 44O and FIGURE 8 shows a restriction map of composite plasmid pAJ 3148. The term multicopy plasmid is used in the sense of the ordinary definition, and means a plasmid which exists in a plural number in a host cell. WDrive unitw is the minimum genetic region necessary for controlling the capability of gene propagation in a host cell. Resistance to a drug is used in the ordinary definition and means resistance to a drug, such as an antibiotic, which inhibits the growth of a host cell.Examples of such antibiotics are penicillin, kanamycin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, actinomycin, and the like. Coryneform bacteria are aerobic, gram positive rods, are non acidfast, and are described in Bergey s Manual ofDeterminative Bacteriology, 8th ed., 599, 1974 .Examples of specimens of wild strains of Coryneform glutamic acid producing bacteria useful as hosts in this invention are as follows Brevibacterium divaricatum ATCC 14020, Brevibacterium saccharoliticum ATCC 14066, Brevibacterium immariophilum ATCC 14068, Brevibacterium lactofermentum ATCC 13869, Brevibacterium roseum ATCC 13825, Brevibacterium flavum ATCC 13826, Brevibacterium thiogenitalis ATCC 19240, Corvnebacterium acetoacidophilum ATCC 13870, Corynebacterium acetoglutamicum ATCC 15806, Corvnebacterium callunae ATCC 15991, Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC 13032, 13060 Corynebacterium lilium ATCC 15990, Corynebacterium melassecola ATCC 17965, Microbacterium ammoniachilum ATCC 15354. Corvneform glutamic acid producing bacteria also include mutants which have lost the productivity of glutamic acid or have productivity of other amino acids such as lysine and arginine purine nucleosides such as inosine purine nucleotides such as inosine 5 monophosphate and other fermentation products. A preferred result may be obtained when theCoryneform glutamic acid producing bacteria are mutated in a known manner to a lower restriction enzyme activity prior to using them as the hosts for the composite plasmid of the invention, or the composite plasmid having a foreign gene insertion. When the Coryneform glutamic acid producing bacteria as above are transformed with the composite plasmid carrying a foreign gene insert, they would then express the genetic information possessed by the foreign gene. Specimens of multicopy plasmids capable of propagating in Corvneform glutamic acid producing bacteria are as follows 1 pAM 330 a Separated from Brevibacterium lactofermentum ATCC 13869. b Molecular weight 3.0 megadalton Calculated by migration distance on agarose gel electrophoresis and length of the DNA chain under an electron microscope c Sensitivity to restriction enzymes shown in Table 1 d Restriction map shown in FIGURE 1.

Biol. Chem., 43, 867, 1979 , which is herein incorporated by reference. The plasmid therein was separated from Brevibacterium lactofermentum and the molecular weight is 37 megadalton. Plasmids b capable of propagating in Escherichia coli are preferably multicopy plamids and have genetic information of resistance to a drug. They are, for example, pAC 105, RSF 2124, pCR 1, pMB 9, pBR 313, pBR 322, pBR 324, pBR 325, pBR 327, pBR 328, pKY 2289, pKY C 2700, pKN 80, pRC 7, pKB 158, pMK 2004, pACY 177, and pACYC 184. Plasmids b capable of propagating in Bacillus subtilis and having genetic information of resistance to a drug are preferably multicopy, such as, for example, pT 127, pC 194, pC 221, pC 223, pUB 112, pUB 110, pSA 0501, pSA 2100, pE 194, pTP 4 and pTP 5. In order to construct the composite plasmid of the present invention from the plasmids a and b , conventional methods can be employed. For example, both plasmids a and b are digested by one or several restriction enzymes which form complemental terminii, or flush end terminii at the cleaved point, and thereafter the digested plasmids a and b are ligated with a ligase. The composite plasmid can also be prepared by cutting both plasmids a and b with one or several restriction enzymes or with shearing force, treating with an exonuclease when required, elongating to complementary single chain of oligonucleotides wit terminal trans at ferase the terminii of the cut plasmids, and finally a and annealing the derivatives of the cut plasmids b . as well as plasmid a As to the gene fragment derived from plasmid b , it is desirable to slice at a fragment thereof other than in the genetic region which expresses drug resistance, or in the genetic region which comprises the drive unit region. Most desirably, the gene fragment derived from plasmid 1 has both the drug resistance gene region and the drive unit region which makes the composite plasmid a shuttle . After the ligation reaction, the desired composite plasmids can be screened as follows Composite plasmids having a drive unit region derived from plasmid a , and a gene fragment comprising a gene region to express drug resistance derived from plasmid b can be obtained by isolating plasmids which can propagate in Coryneform glutamic acid producing bacteria and can transform theCoryneform glutamic acid producing bacteria into drug resistant.Further, a composite plasmid having a driveunit region derived from plasmid a , and another driveunit region derived from plasmid b , and the drug resistant gene of plasmid b can be found among plasmids which can propagate in Coryneform glutamic acid producing bacteria and in Escherichia coli or Bacillus subtilis, and which can transform the 1 Coryneform glutamic acidproducing bacteria, or 2 Escherichia coli, in case the plasmid used was capable of propagating in Escherichia coli or Bacillus subtilis, in case the plasmid used was capable of propagating in Bacillus subtilis , and which are drug resistant. Desirable strains of Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis are Escherichia coli K 12 and Bacillus subtilis RM 125. The incorporation of plasmid DNA into the hosts ofCoryneform glutamic acid producing bacteria can be done by treating the cells of the DNA recipient with calcium chloride to increase the permeability of DNA, as is reported regarding E. coli K 12 Mandel, M. and Higa, A.,J. Mol. Biol., 53, 159 1970 , or by incorporating at a specific a stage of growth when cells become capable of incorporating DNA competent cells as is reported inBacillus subtilis Duncan, C. H., Wilson, G. A. andYoung, F. E., Gene 1, 153 1977 . The plasmid can also be incorporated into the DNArecipient by forming protoplasts or spheroplasts of theDNA recipient, which easily incorporate plasmid DNA, as is known in Bacillus subtilis, actinomycetes and yeast Chang, S. and Choen, S. N., Molec. Gen. Genet., 168, 111 1979 Bibb, M. J., Ward, J. M. and Hopwood, O. A., Nature, 274, 398 1978 Hinnen, A., Hicks, J. B. andFink, G. R., Proc. Nat l. Acad. Sci., USA. 75, 1929 1978 . Since the composite piasmid obtained in this invention can transform Coryneform glutamic acidproducing bacteria into drug resistant bacteria,Coryneform glutamic acid producing bacteria which contain the composite plasmid or composite plasmid inserted with a foreign gene can be easily identified by testing their resistance to the drug. When the composite plasmid possesses a gene fragment having a drive unit region of plasmid b , the composite plasmid can also propagate in Escherichia coli orBacillus subtilis, and the composite plasmid or a composite plasmid carrying a foreign gene insertion can be amplified or cloned using Escherichia coli or Bacillus subtilis. The composite plasmids of the present invention contained in the hosts are deposited at selectedInternational Depositary Authorities as follows pAJ 655 Escherichia coli AJ 11882, FEM P 6517 FERM BP 136 Corynebacterium glutamicum SR 8201 ATCC 39135 pAJ 611 Escherichia coli AJ 11884 FERM P 6519 FERM BP 138 pAJ 1844 Escherichia coli AJ 11883 FERM P 6518 FERM BP 137 Corynebacterium glutamicum SR8202 ATCC 39136 pAJ 440 Bacillus subtilis AJ 11901 FERtI BP 140 pAJ 3148 Corynebacterium glutamicum SR8203 ATCC 39137 The composite plasmid of the present invention can be obtained from the cells of the microorganisms deposited in the International Depositary Authorities by lysing the cells previously harvested at a late exponential growth phase with lysozyme and SDS, adding polyethylene glycol to a supernatant obtained from the lysate by centrifugation at 30,000 Xg, and purifying the precipitated DNA by fractionation using cesium chlorideethidium bromide equilibrium density gradient centrifugation. The composite plasmid in the host strain can be expelled to obtain host strain without injury thereto from the deposited microorganism as follows The plasmid may be lost spontaneously from hosts or can be eliminated by a curing treatment Bact. Rev., 36, p 361 405 1972 . An example of curing is as follows A small inoculum of about 104 cells ml of the strain is cultured overnight at 27 35 C in a medium containing a subinhibitory concentration 2 50 pg ml of acridine orange to give incomplete inhibition of growth 1J. Bacteriol., 88, 261 1964 . The culture is plated on an agar plate, and incubated at 27 420C overnight. Many of the colonies appearing on the plate may quite likely be cured of plasmid. Having now generally described this invention, the same will become better understood by reference to certain specific examples which are included herein for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to be limiting unless otherwise specified. EXAMPLE 1 In the present Example is shown a composite plasmid, pAJ 655 which was constructed from plasmids pBR325 and pAM 330, which composite plasmid can multiply inEscherichia coli K 12. 1 Plasmid pBR 325 is a plasmid of 3.6 Md origi nating in Escherichia coli it confers resis e tance to tetracyclinX chloramphenicol, and ampicillin in Escherichia coli Boliver, F. Gene, 4, 121 1978 . The sample of pBR.325 used in this example was purchased from Bethesda Research Laboratory BRL . 2 Plasmid pAM 330 is a plasmid of 3.0 Md newly isolated by the inventors from Brevibacterium lactofermentum ATCC 13869, and the restriction map of the plasmid is shown in FIGURE 1. A sample of the plasmid pAM 330 DNA was prepared as follows Cells of Brevibacterium lactofermentum ATCC 13869 were harvested by centrifugation at late exponential growth phase at 300C in 1 liter of CMG medium, pH 7.2, which contianed, per liter of distilled water lOg peptone, 10g yeast extract, 5g NaCl, and 5g glucose. The cells obtained were lysed by a conventional method such as treatment with lysozyme and sodium dodecyl sulfate. Supernatant 64 ml of the lysate was obtained by centrifugation at 30,000xg for 30 minutes, and the DNA in the supernatant was precipitated by the addition of polyethyleneglycol final 10 , and resolved in 10 ml of TEN buffer.After an RNase treatment 50 pg.ml of RNase I at 370 for 30 minutes and phenol extraction, DNA was precipitated with 2 volumes of ethanol at 200C and resolved in 1 ml of TEN buffer. The DNA obtained was applied to agarose gel electrophoresis. About 74 pg of the plasmid DNA was isolated from the gels. 3 Construction, isolation and identification of composite plasmids. i Plasmid pBR 325 DNA 0.2 pg was digested with 1 unit of restriction enzyme BamHI purchased from BRL at 370C for 60 minutes. ii pAM 330 DNA 1.2 pg was partially digested at 370C for 15 minutes with 0.2 units of restriction enzyme MboI. iii Digested DNAs obtained in i and ii were mixed and kept at 650C for 10 minutes, followed by a ligation reaction with 0.01 unit of T4 DNA ligase in the presence of ATP and dithiothreitol at 220C for 2 hours. The reaction mixture was heated at 650C for 10 minutes, mixed with 2 volumes of ethanol, and thereafter the ligated DNA fractions were collected by centrifugation at 15,000 xg for 15 minutes. Composite plasmid DNA thus obtained was used in the following transformation iv . iv Cells of a middle logarithmic phase of Escherichia coli C 600 the, let , thiamine , r , m Meselson, M. and Yuan, R. Nature, 217, 1110 1968 were obtained by cultivation at 300C in 20 ml of OGM medium. The cells of C 600 were transformed with the DNA obtained in iii according to the method in Kushner, et al., Genetic Engineering , p. 17 1978 , Elsevier North Holland Biomedical Press. Transformants were selected using CMG agar plates supplemented with 20 vg ml of chloramphenicol after having been cultivated at 370C for 24 hours. Among these transformants, strain AJ 11882 was selected and used for further examinations. The DNA of the composite plasmid, named pA3 655, was isolated from the cell lysate of AJ 11882 by the follow ing method Cells of AJ 11882 were obtained after culture in 1G medium and lysed by a conventional method lunaka et al., 3. Bacteriol., 121, 354 1975 , and the lysate was applied to agarose gel and electrophoresed Sharp et al., Biochemistry 12, 3055 2973 . By comparing to the molecular weight standards pBR 325 the Molecular Weight of the plasmid was determined as 6.6 Md. The restriction map of the plasmid, illustrated inFIGURE 4, shows that the plasmid is composed of fragments of pBR 325 and pAM 330, as determined the method of K.J.Danna in Methods in Enzymology 65, 449 Academic Press 1980 . EXAMPLE 2 In the present Example it is shown that the composite plasmid, pAJ 655 obtained in Example 1 can multiply in Brevibacterium lactofermentum and an antibiotic resistance marker on pAJ 655 originated from pBR 325 is expressed. The recipient strain used was Brevibacterium lactofermentum No. 64 which was a triple lysine, methionine and threonine auxotrophic mutant derived from Brevibacterium lactofermentum ATCC 13869. 1 Preparation of protoplast. Brevibacterium lactofermentum No. 64 ATCC No. 39134 was cultured in 5 ml of CMG medium until at an early exponential growth phase, 0.6 ml units of penicillin G was added and the cultivation was continued further for 1.5 hours. Cells were collected by centrifugation and washed with 0.5 ml of SMMP medium composed of 0.5M sucrose, 20 mM maleic acid, 20 mM MgC12, 3.5 Pennassay broth Difco , pH 6.5. Protoplasts were prepared from these cells by treatment with 10 mg ml lysozyme in SMMP medium at 300C for 20 hours followed by centrifugation 6,000 xg for 10 minutes. , washed with SMMP medium and resuspended in 0.5 ml SMMP. 2 Transformation, selection of transformant and identification of plasmid. Protoplasts thus obtained in 1 were mixed with 2 vg of pAJ 655 DNA prepared in Example 1 in 0.1 ml, and added to final 30 polyethyleneglycol and kept at room temperature for 2 minutes in order to absorb and introduce the DNA into the protoplasts. After having been washed in 1 ml of SMMP medium the protoplasts with DNA were resuspended in 1 ml of SMMP medium, and cultured at 300C for 3 hours for the expression of drug resistance. The resulting culture liquid was spread onto a protoplast regeneration medium , pH 7.0, which contained, per one liter of distilled water 12g Tris hydroxymethyl aminomethane, 0.5g KCl, 10g glucose, 8.lg MgC12.6H2O, 2.2g CaC12.2H2O, 4g peptone, 4g yeast extract, lg Casamino acid Difco , 0.2g K2HPO4, 135g Na succinate, 18g agar and 5 vg ml chloramphenicol. Five of the colonies which appeared after 3 10 days cultivation, at 300 C, were further examined by culturing on CMG medium supplemented with 20 g of chloramphenicol per ml and the cells resistant to chloramphenicol were lysed to detect the existence of plasmid.The lysates were applied to agarose gel and electrophoresed by the same methods as in Example 1 and found having plasmids of the same molecular weight and the same restriction map as pAJ 655. EXAMPLE 3 In the present Example, it is shown that the composite plamid XAJ611 made in Example 4 can multiply inCorynebacterium glutamicum and express the antibiotic resistance marker originated from pBR325. Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC 13060 was used as the recipient strain, and its protoplast transformation with pay 611 DNA extracted from Escherichia coli AJ 11884 was carried out as described in Example 2. One of the transformants named as SR 8201, was resistant to Chloramphenicol in CMG, and contained the same plasmid as pAJ611 as determined from the molecular weight and the restriction map. EXAMPLE 4 In the present Example is shown a composite plasmid, named pAJ 611, which was constructed from plasmid pBR 325 and plasmid pAM 286, and it is shown that the composite plasmid can multiply in Escherichia coli. 1 Plasmid pBR 325 used was the same sample as in Example 1. 2 Plasmid pAM 286 is a plasmid newly isolated by the inventors from Corynebacterium glutamicum AJ 11560 deposited as FERM P 5485 . Its molecular weight is 3.0 Md and its restriction map is shown in FIGURE 2. About 20 pg of plasmid pAM 286 was obtained by the same proce dure in Example 1. 3 Construction, isolation and identification of composite plasmid pAJ 611 was carried out by the method of Example 1 except pAM 286 DNA was used in place of pAM 330 DNA. The composite plasmid pAJ 611, whose molecular weight was 6.6 Md and whose restriction map is shown in FIGURE 5, was screened using Escherichia coli C 600 as the host by the same procedure as in Example 1, pAJ 611 was obtained by the manner shown in Example 1 from Escherichia coli, AJ 11884, harbouring pAJ 611. EXAMPLE 5 Th the present Example is shown a composite plasmid, pAJ 440, which was constructed from plasmid pUB 110 and pAM 330, and it is shown that the composite plasmid can multiply in B. substilis. 1 Plasmid pUB 110 is a plasmid of 3.0 Md. origi nating in Staphylococcus aureus, it replicates and confers resistance to kanamycin in Bacillus subtilis i eggins, K, M, Lovett, P, S, and Duval, E. J., Proc, Natl, Acad, Sci., 75, 1423 1978 . The sample of pUB 110 used was pur chased from Bethesda Research Laboratory BRL and used according to the direction of the maker. 2 Preparation of plasmid pAM 330 is described in Example 1. 3 Construction, isolation and identification of composite plasmids. i pUB 110 DNA 0.2ug was digested at 370C for 60 minutes with 1 unit of restriction enzyme Bam HI purchased from BRL ii pAM 330 DNA l.2pg was partially digested at 370C for 15 minutes with 0.2 unit of restriction enzyme MboI. iii Digested DNAs i and ii were mixed, ligated by the method described in Example 1, and the ligated DNA was electrophoresed using 0.8 agarose gel at 5v cm for 2 hours in Tris acetate buffer pH 8.0 system. me DNA frac tion which ran slower than pUB 110 monomer DNA was extracted from the gel, treated with phenol, and collected as ethanol precipitate. iv Bacillus subtilis RM 125 arg , leu , r , m Uozumi, T. et. al., Molec. Gen. Genet, 152, 65 1975 was transformed with the DNA mixture obtained in iii according to a conventional procedure tDabnaut D., et al., J. Mol. Biol., 56, 209 1971 . Transformants were selected using CMG agar plates supplemented with 5 pgXml kanamycin as those which propagated by cultivation at 370C for 24 hours. Twenty transformants appearing on the CMG agar plates supplemented with 5 pg ml kanamycin were lysed, and plasmid DNA was detected. One of them which had a clear plasmid band was designated as KS 440, deposited atATCC No. 39139 and the plasmid was named pAJ 440. The pAJ 440 DNA was extracted from the gel, and cleaved by several restriction enzymes. This plasmid pAJ 440 was concluded to be a composite plasmid of pUB 110 and pAM 330, according to the molecular weight of 6.0 Md and the restriction map, which is shown in FIGURE 7. EXAMPLE 6 In the present Example is shown that the composite plasmid pAJ 440 can multiply in Brevibacterium lactofermentum, and that an antibiotic resistance marker on pAJ 440 originated from pUB 110 is expressed. The host strain used was Brevibacterium lactofermentum No. 64. Protoplast transformation of No.64 with pAJ 440 DNA was carried out by the method described in Example 2 with the following exceptions 1 pg of pAJ 440 DNA was used for transformation, and the Protoplast regeneration medium containing 100 vg ml of kanamycin was used for the selection of transformants. Two of the transformants which appeared after 3 10 days cultivation, were cultured on CMG medium supplemented with 20 pg ml kanamycin, lysed, and the lysate was applied to agarose gel and electrophoresed for the detection of plasmids by the same methods as in the previous Examples. Plasmids of the molecular weight and of the same restriction map of pAJ 440 in Example 4 were found in both transformants. EXAMPLE 7 In the present Example is shown a composite plasmid, pAJ 1844 which was constructed from plasmid pBR 325 and pHM 1519 the composite plasmid can multiply inEscherichia coli. 1 Plasmid pBR 325 used was the same sample shown in Example 1. 2 Plasmid pHM 1519 is a plasmid newly isolated by the inventors from Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC 13058. Its molecular weight is 1.8 Md and its restriction map is shown in FIGURE 3. About 24 vg of pHM 1519 DNA was obtained by the same procedure as in Example 1. 3 Construction, isolation and identification of the composite plasmid pAJ 1844. i 0.2 vg of pBR 325 DNA was digested by the method of Example 1. ii 1.0 ug of plasmid pHM 1519 DNA was digested with 5 units of a restriction enzyme Bgl II Boehringer Manheim GmbH at 37 C for 60 minutes. iii Transformants were obtained by introducing composite plasmid DNA into Escherichia coli C 600 by the procedure shown in Example 1. A composite plasmid, named pAJ 1844, was isolated from one of the transformants i.e., Escherichia coli AJ 11883. Its molecular weight is 5.4 Md and its restriction map is shown in FIGURE 6. EXAMPLE 8 In the present Example, it is shown that the composite plasmid pAJ 1844 constructed in Example 7 can propagate in Corynebacterium glutamicum and express the antibiotic resistance markers on pAJ 1844 originated from pBR 325. Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC 13032 was used as the recipient and by the protoplast transformation system described in Example 2, pAJ1844 DNA obtained fromEscherichia coli AJ11883 was successfully introduced and confirmed as the same plasmid as pAJ1844. SR 8202 is a representative transformant harboring pAJ1844 EXAMPLE 9 In the present Example is shown a composite plasmid, named pAJ 3148, which was constructed from plasmids pUB 110 and pHM 1519 the composite plasmid can multiply in Bacillus subtilis. 1 Plasmid pUB 110 used was the same sample as in Example 5, and digested with restriction enzyme Bam HI by the method of Example 5. 2 Plasmid pnM 1519 used was the same sample, and digested with restriction enzyme Bgl II by the method of Example 7. 3 Digested DNAs obtained in 1 and 2 were mixed, and ligated, and the ligated DNA was electrophoresed. DNA larger than pUB 110 monomer was isolated, and introduced into Bacillus subtilis RM 125, by the method of Example 5. A plasmid larger than pUB 110 was detected in a transformant designated as No. 1129. This plasmid, pAJ 3148, was shown to have a molecular weight of 6.6 Md and its restriction map is shown in FIGURE 8. As shown in FIGURE 8, this plasmid is composed of 1 molecule of pUB 110 and two molecules of pHM 1519. EXAMPLE 10 In the present Example, it is shown that the composite plasmid pAJ3148 constructed in Example 9 can propagate in Corynebacterium glutamicum and express the antibiotic resistance marker originated from pUB110. Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC 13032 was used as the recipient, and by the protoplast transformationEMI28.1 system described in Example 2, pAJ3148 DNA IoztaineXd fromBacillus Subtilis No.1129 was able to be introduced intoATCC 13032, propagated, and expressed kanamycin resistance. The molecular weight and the restriction map were the same as those of pAJ3148. EXAMPLE li In the present Example is shown a model of a cloning experiment. A new composite plasmid pSR8204 was constructed from the vector plasmid pAJ1844 described inExample 7 and a chromosomal DNA fragment which carries at least one gene for m fluoro phenylalanine resistance. 1 Placid pAJ1844 is a composite plasmid constructed in Example 7 and propagated in Escherichia coli AJ 11883 described in Example 7. pAJ1844 was used as a vector and digested by Pst I restriction enzyme. 2 As a model of inserted DNA fragment, the chromosomal DNA of Brevibacterium lactofermentum FERM p1914 was chosen, extracted, and cut by Pst I. FERM p1914 is characterized by its m fluoro phenylalanine resistance, and productivity of phenylalamine in the medium. 3 Both Pst I digested DNA s, vector plasmid and chromosomal DNA were mixed and ligated. 4 Ligated DNA was challenged to the protoplast of Corynebacteriu glutamicum ATCC 13060 and the transformants were first selected as the chloramphenicol resistant. A second screening was to check the resistancy to m fluoro phenyl alanine the third was the productivity of phenylalanine. Plasmid DNA analysis on a cleaved lysate of transformant was done by agarose gel electrophoresis.Experimental i Vector DNA Composite plasmid pAJ1844 was extracted from Escherichia ccli AJ 11883. To 20 ml CMG culture of AJ 11883, at late logarithmic growing phase, was added 170 pg ml of chloramphenicol and then cultivated an extra 18 hr. TENpg of plasmid DNA was obtained from the cleared lysate of chloramphenicol treated cells. 0.05g of this DNA was completely digested by Pst I for 60 min. at 370C, and the aliquots were combined. ii Chromosomal DNA 30 mg of chromosomal DNA ofBrevibacterium lactofermentum AJ 3437 FERM p 1914 was extracted from 1 1 of CMG culture by a conventional phenol method. 10 vg of this DNA was partially digested by 10 units of Pst I for 5 minutes to 60 minutes at 370 C, and aliquots were accumulated. iii Ligation DNA s i and ii were mixed and ligated by 0.1 unit of T4 ligase for 4 hr. at 220C.Other conditions were the same as in Example 1. iv Recipient cells Protoplasts ofCorynebacterium glutamicum ATCC 13060 were used as the recipient for the ligated DNA iii . To prepare the protoplast, early exponentially growing cells in 1G medium were treated by 1.2 unit ml of penicillin G for 1.5 hr., harvested, washed, resuspended in 0.5 ml of SMMP medium which contained 10 mg of of egg white lysozyme and incubated for 20 hr. at 300 C. v Transformation ligated DNA iii and protoplast iv were combined and adsorption of DNA to the protoplast was stimulated by the addition of polyethylene glycol final 30 . The DNA protoplast complex thus obtained was washed and plated on the regeneration medium Example 2 which contains 5 pg ml of chloramphenicol as a selection drug. vi Transformant Several hundreds of chloramphenicol resistant transformants were picked up and examined for m fluoro phenylalamine resistancy to lmg ml of m fluoro phenylalamine in the minimal medium which contained, per one liter of distilled water, 10 g glucose, 2g NH4 2SO4, 1 g XH2PO4 0.4 g MgSO4, 7H2O, 2 ppm Fe , 2 ppm I9Ln , 100 l,g d biotin, 1 mg thiamine HC1, 15 g agar, at pH 7.2. vii Plasmid analysis Cleared lysate of transformants were applied to agarose gel with molecular weight standards pAJ 1844 and pAJ 655 and electrophressed. The molecular weight of plasmid in a transformant was about 6 megadalton. mis transformant was designated as SR 8204,ATCC39138 and harboring plasmid pSR8204. viii Production of phenylalanine The amounts of phenylalamine produced in medium P were 1 g l by SR8204 and lower than 0.1 g l by host ATCC 13060. Those of tyrosine produced in the same medium were 0.4 g l by SR 8204 and lower than 0.1 g l by host ATCC 13060. The medium P contained in 1 litre distilled water, 100 g glucose, 40 g NH4 gSO4, 1 g KH2PO4, 0.4 g MgSO4.7H2O, 2 ppm Fe , 2 ppm Mn , 100 pg d biotin, 1 mg thiamine HCl, 50 g CaCO3, pH 7.0.
