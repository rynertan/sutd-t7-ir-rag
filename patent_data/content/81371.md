# Improvements in or relating to multiple collector mass spectrometers.

## Abstract
In a mass spectrometer, suitable for use in the determination of isotope ratios, having as a mass selector a sector magnet 3 and detector means 18,9,19 for detecting and measuring the intensity of ion beams 15,16,17 at two or more positions in the focal plane of said sector magnet 3 , the improvement comprises providing the exit 13 and optionally also the entrance 14 pole face of said sector magnet 3 with a curvature such that the focal plane of said sector magnet 3 lies substantially at right angles to the ion optical axis as it passes through said focal plane. With this arrangement, motion of detector means 18,19 between positions in said focal plane by means of mechanical linkages controlled from outside the vacuum system of the mass spectrometer is facilitated.
