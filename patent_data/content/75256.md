# LOCK UP CONTROL DEVICE AND METHOD FOR LOCK UP TYPE AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION

## Abstract
A pulse train is generated which has a duration increasing as the vehicle speed decreases. A counter generates a period indicative signal indicative of a current perod of the pulse train. A memory stores the period indicative signal for the succeeding period. An adder generates an adder signal indicative of the addition of a preset value to the period indicative signal stored in the memory. A comparator compares the adder signal with the period indicative signal generated by the period indicative signal generating means and generates a com parator signal when the former is larger than the latter. A flip flop generates a flip flop signal when the com parator signal occurs under the presence of a lock up signal. An AND gate provides a lock up release signal when said flip flop signal occurs irrespective of the presence of the lock up signal.
