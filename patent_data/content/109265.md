# Container with tamper evident lid.

## Abstract
A container 1 is provided with a lid 2 which is releasably secured to it by means of interlocking beads 4 and 8 respective ly on the container and a depending skirt of the lid. An annular flange 3 which abuts and is flush with the skirt of the lid serves as a protecting member to make it difficult for the lid to be re moved without making use of a tamper evident facility pro vided on the upper surface of the lid. This facility consists of a pull ring 6 integrally moulded with the lid and firmly attached to it adjacent the periphery of the lid. In its inactive position, prior to the first removal of the lid from the container, it is held by a number of frangible connection points 7 in a recess 5 pro vided in the lid. In order to remove the lid from the container, it is necessary to grip the pull ring 6 and pull it upwards thereby breaking the connection points and providing a subsequent in dication that the lid has been removed.
