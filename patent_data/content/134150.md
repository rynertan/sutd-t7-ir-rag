# WINDOW BLINDS, TEXTILE FABRICS AND THE MANUFACTURE THEREOF

## Abstract
A fabric 10 is produced, preferably by knitting, with a series of first strips 12 of a first textile thread alternating with a series of second strips 14 of a second textile thread. The first strips 12 are relatively stiff and opaque and the second strips 14 are of a more flexible diaphanous material. The first textile thread consists of a filament of plastics material coated with molten synthetic plastics material to which staple fibres such as wool, cotton or acrylic are adhered. The fabric 10 af ter production is heat treated to cause the first strips to stiffen. The fabric can be used to produce vertical blinds, folding blinds, folding doors, etc.
