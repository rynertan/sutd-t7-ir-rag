# Multi purpose tracheal tube.

## Abstract
A multi purpose tracheal tube 2 for use with high frequency ventilation. The tube 2 4 is an endotracheal tube including up to three lumens, in addition to the primary lumen, which serve various functions to provide versatility in the treatment of patients. In cuffed tubes one of the lumens is used for inflating the cuff 12 once the tube has been placed in the desired position in the trachea of the patient. Another lumen, referred to as the insufflation lumen , is used to deliver oxygen or other gases by constant insufflation, intermittent jet ventilation or high frequency ventilation. The third lumen, when incorporated, is employed for monitoring and irrigation. The distal opening 42 of the irrigation or monitoring lumen is located just inside the distal tip 6 of the tube 4 while the insufflation lumen opening is located rearwardly toward the primal end 7 of the tube 4 relative to the irrigation or monitoring lumen opening 42 .
