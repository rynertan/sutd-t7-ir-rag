# Digital acquisition system including a high speed sampling gate.

## Abstract
A digital acquisition system includes a highspeed sam pling gate with analog memory for sampling input signals. The samples are converted to digital representations and stored in a digital memory. The digital representations are selectively recalled from the digital memory and fed back as estimators to the sampling gate s analog memory. Since the estimators are essentially the previous samples for each point of a given waveform, the stored waveform converges to the input waveform very quickly, facilitating accurate waveform replication. Embodiments for both sequential sampling and pseudo random sampling are provided. Oper ational techniques of the digital acquisition system include noise reduction, loop gain determination, adaptive filtering and signal averaging.
