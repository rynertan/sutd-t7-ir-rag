# Position sensing apparatus.

## Abstract
A probe for sensing the position of a workpiece 154 comprises a housing 149 adapted to be secured to a coordinate measuring machine. A stylus 152 projecting from the housing is engageable with the workpiece for sensing the position thereof. The stylus 152 is secured to a moveable member 110 supported within the housing 149 by three bellows 120, 130, 140 having mutually perpendicu lar axes A, B, C and each secured to the moveable member 110 and the housing 149 in position therebetween. Since a bellows is inherently stiff in torsion about its axis but is flexible axially and transversely the bellows 120, 130, 140 cooperate to constrain the stylus 152 for parallel motion. More particularly, any one first bellows 140 can expand or contract to accommodate movement of the stylus 152 in the direction of the axis CI of that the first bellows 140 , a second one of bellows 130 prevents tilting of the stylus 152 by virtue of torsional stiffness. At the same time both the second 130 and third bellows 120 flex transversely to accommodate the expansion or contraction of the first bellows 140 . The stylus is biased into a rest position determined by the condition of the bellows 120, 130, 140 when the stylus 152 is free. Displacement of the stylus 152 is determinable by inductive proximity sensors 156, 157, 158 .
