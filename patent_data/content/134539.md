# Position detecting apparatus.

## Abstract
A position detecting apparatus has a matrix like arrange ment constituted by a plurality of substantially parallel X direction magnetostrictive line bundles, each of the bun dles having at least one magnetostrictive transmission medium element 1a to 1d , and a plurality of substantially parallel Y direction magnetostrictive line bundles, each of the bundles having at least one magnetostrictive transmis sion medium element 10a to 10d , the Y direction magneto strictive line bundles crossing the X direction magneto strictive line bundles substantially at a right angle. First coils 2, 11 are wound commonly around one ends of the X direction magnetostrictive line bundles and Y direction mag netostrictive line bundles, respectively. Second coils 5, 13 have portions wound round the X direction magnetostrictive line bundles over a large length thereof and the portions wound round the Y direction magnetostrictive line bundles over a large length thereof. The first and second coils in respective directions make signal exchange therebetween through the magnetostrictive transmission medium. The electro mechanical coupling coefficient of the magnetostric tive transmission medium is changed only a portion thereof by means of the position appointing magnetism generator 7 , and this position is detected through the detection of a change in the signal receiving timing caused by the change of the electro magnetic coupling coefficient. The magnetism generator 7 is not connected at all to any stationary part. The detection can be made within the position detection region with a high resolution even when the position appointing magnetism generator is spaced considerably from the apparatus in the vertical direction. The apparatus, therefore, can be applied to a system for automatically detecting the position of a moving body, by attaching the position appointing magnetism generator to such a moving body.
