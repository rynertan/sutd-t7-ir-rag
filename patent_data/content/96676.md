# METHOD AND DEVICE IN MANUFACTURING FOAMED UREA FORMALDEHYDE MATERIAL TO BE USED AS A SORBENT

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method of manufacturing a sorbent. A foam is produced by combining a urea formal dehyde resin with a foaming agent. The foam produced is allowed to expand into a covering and the hardening of the expanded foam is initiated in said covering. The foam when at least partially hardened is cut into pieces and the foam pieces are packed with preserved moisture content into hermetically sealed packages. The invention also relates to a sorbent manufactured by the method.
