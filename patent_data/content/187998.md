## Description
The present invention relates to a display unit for forming a display screen, which display unit comprises the features of the general clause of claim 1, which features are disclosed in JP A 59 155 829. This conventional display unit is provided with a fluorescent lamp and deals with the problem that the opposite ends of this fluorescent lamp, which ends are provided with bases and filaments, respectively, show a lower luminance than the other section of this fluorescent lamp. With increasing time of use, however, the luminance of the whole end sections of the fluorescent lamp decreases more remarkably than that of the middle section thereof a black stain at each end section increases with the time. Thus, when a large display screen is formed by arranging a plurality of the liquid display units, the irregularity of the luminance of the liquid crystal display panels forming the display screen becomes ccnspicuous, deteriorating the quality of the displayed image. The present invention has been made to solve those problems of the conventional display unit. Accordingly, it is the aim of the present invention to improve the above mentioned, known display unit in such a way that it shows a uniform luminance even after extended use. This aim is solved by the features of claim 1 this solution is improved by the features of the further claims. In the drawing is A liquid display unit generally comprises a case 1, a guide groove 1a formed in the case 1, a liquid crystal panel 2, namely, a display panel, a fluorescent lamp 3 disposed within and held on the case 1 and having at the opposite ends ea thereof bases 3b, a reflecting plate 4 holding the liquid crystal panel 2 and disposed within and held on the case 1 so as to reflect the light emitted by the fluorescent lamp 3 toward the backside of the liquid crystal panel 2, d D A conversion circuit board 6 having a circuit capable of D A conversion, a liquid crystal driving circuit board 7 mounted with an LSI for driving the liquid crystal panel 2 on the basis of analog signals provided by the D A conversion circuit board 6, and a connector 8 for connecting the fluorescent lamp 3 to a power source, not shown. A plurality of the liquid crystal display units thus constituted are mounted on a supporting frame by receiving the guide rails of the supporting frame in the guide grooves 1a of the liquid crystal display units, respectively, so as to form a display screen of a predetermined size and shape. In operation, digital signals corresponding to a still picture or an animated picture, produced by an external controller, not shown, are converted into corresponding analog signals meeting the characteristics of the liquid crystal by the circuit of the D A conversion circuit board 6. The analog signals thus produced are transmitted throgugh the liquid crystal driving circuit board 7 to the liquid crystal panel. Since the liquid crystal panel itself is a non luminous element, a light source is necessary for illuminating the liquid crystal panel. The fluorescent lamp 3 is lighted by a fluorescent lamp starting device not shown to illuminate the liquid crystal panel 2. The light transmissivity of the liquid crystal panel 2 is controlled according to the analog signals given thereto so that an image corresponding to the still picture or the animated picture is displayed on the liquid crystal panel 2. Fig. 1 illustrates a liquid crystal display unit, in a first embodiment, according to the present invention. In Fig. 1, indicated at 9 is a substantially U shaped fluorescent lamp employed as a light emitting body. The opposite end sections 9a of the fluorescent lamp 9 are bent perpendicularly to the middle section thereof to extend away therefrom to form a pair of inner corners on a far side of the fluorescent lamp 9 from the elongated display panel. Bases 9b are attached to the opposite end sections of the fluorescent lamp 9, respectively. The U shaped fluorescent lamp 9 is disposed behind an elongated liquid crystal display panel 2 with the middle section thereof, namely, the straight portion, extending in parallel to the surface and over the overall length of the elongated liquid crystal display panel 2 to face the same from end to end and the opposite end sections extending away from the liquid crystal display panel 2. The opposite end sections, which are less luminous than the middle section, are located outside a range corresponding to the liquid crystal display panel 2 and only the middle section of the U shaped fluorescent lamp providing longitudinally uniform distribution of luminance is located opposite to the liquid crystal display panel 2. As a result, the liquid crystal display panel 2 is illuminated uniformly over the entire area thereof. Said elongated display panel 2 and said fluorescent lamp 9 are housed in a case 1. The effective length of the bent end section 9a of the U shaped fluorescent lamp 9 is not less than about 70mm. The bending angle of the end sections need not necessarily be a right angle, but may be any angle for the same effect. When the bending angle is 180 degrees, that is, when a straight fluorescent lamp 3 is employed, the length of the fluorescent lamp needs to be decided so that the opposite end portions thereof having a lower luminance are located outside a range corresponding to the liquid crystal display panel. The cross sectional shape of the fluorescent lamp may be any suitable shape, such as an ellipse. Thus, since only a portion of a fluorescent lamp having uniform luminance is disposed opposite to the liquid crystal display panel 2, the entire area ℓ of the liquid crystal display panel 2 can be illuminated uniformly, which improves the quality of the image displayed on a large display screen consisting of a plurality of the liquid crystal display units of the present invention. Figs. 2 and 3 illustrates a liquid crystal display unit, in a second embodiment, according to the present invention. The structure of this liquid crystal display unit is substantially the same as that of the first embodiment, except that the second embodiment employs a U shaped fluorescent lamp provided with reflective tapes applied to the outer surface of each inner corner thereof. Referring to Fig. 4 illustrating said U shaped fluorescent lamp 3 in a cross section, reflective tapes 10 are applied to the outer surface of the inner corners of the fluorescent lamp 3 at and around the inner corners of the bends, respectively. The reflective tape 10 is a synthetic resin tape coated with a film of a reflective metal, such as aluminium, formed through the vapor deposition process and a layer of an adhesive for applying the tape to the outer surface of the fluorescent lamp. The synthetic resin tape includes a transparent shut of polyethelene or the like. When the U shaped fluorescent lamp 3 is lighted, the light radiated in the glass tube 9 toward the liquid crystal panel 2 travels through the glass tube 9 and falls directly on the liquid crystal display panel 2, while the light radiated in the opposite direction with respect to the liquid crystal display panel 2 is first reflected by the reflective tape 10, then the reflected light travels through the glass tube 9 toward the liquid crystal display panel 2, and then falls on the liquid crystal display panel 2. Thus, the portions of the liquid crystal display panel 2 corresponding to the reflective tapes 10 are irradiated by both the direct light and the reflected light. Consequently, the luminance in those portions is enhanced as compared with the luminance in the opposite end sections of the liquid crystal display panel of the conventional display unit, as indicated by broken line in Fig. 5. Thus, the distribution of luminance L over the enter area ℓ of the liquid crystal display panel 2 is uniform. Figs. 6 and 7 illustrate a U shaped fluorescent lamp employed in a third embodiment of the present invention. This U shaped fluorescent lamp 3 has a reflective tape 11, which is similar to the reflective tape 10 employed in the second embodiment, applied to the outer surface of the middle section of a section thereof extending in parallel to the liquid crystal display panel 2 and facing the backside of the liquid crystal display panel 2. In this U shaped fluorescent lamp 3, the light radiated in the glass tube 9 toward the liquid crystal display panel 2 is reflected by the reflective tape in the opposite direction, and hence the intensity of the light that falls on the liquid crystal display panel 2 in the portion corresponding to the middle section of the U shaped fluorescent lamp 3, namely, the portion facing the reflective tape 11, is reduced. The length and width of the reflective tape 11 are decided so that the intensity of the light emitted by the middle section of the U shaped fluorescent lamp 3 is reduced appropriately to a level corresponding to the intensity of light emitted by the opposite end portions of the same, and thereby the distribution of luminance over the entire area of the liquid crystal display panel 2 becomes uniform. This is accomplished by varying the amount of reflective metal to be vapor deposited on the transparent polyethylene tape. Furthermore, such reflective tapes may be laminated preferably at around the central position of the middle section of the fluorescent lamp 3 while a single sheet of reflective tape is applied to said middle section toward opposite ends thereof. It is also possible, for the same effect, to form a film 10 or 11 of a reflective metal through the vapor deposition process directly over the area corresponding to the area covered with the reflective tape or tapes in the second and third embodiments as shown in Figs. 8 and 9. As apparent from the foregoing description of the preferred embodiments of the present invention, according to the present invention, the relative position of the liquid crystal display panel 2 and the U shaped fluorescent lamp is decided so that only a portion of the U shaped fluorescent lamp, where the longitudinal distribution of luminance is uniform, is located opposite to the liquid crystal display panel, or a reflective tape or reflective tapes are applied to the outer surface of the glass tube of the U shaped fluorescent lamp so that the longitudinal distribution of luminance of the U shaped fluorescent lamp is uniform. Accordingly, the liquid crystal display panel is irradiated uniformly over the entire area thereof, and thereby the quality of the image displayed on the display screen consisting of a plurality of the liquid crystal display panels is improved.
