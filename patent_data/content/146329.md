# Process for preparing oxirane bearing polymer carriers for immobilizing enzymes and other materials bearing active hydrogen, and oxirane bearing polymer carriers.

## Abstract
The invention concerns a process for preparing oxirane bearing polymer carriers for immobilizing material bearing active hydrogen, e.g. enzymes. The carriers may be prepared by suspension copolymerizing an oxirane group bearing, monovinyl monomer and a trivinyl cross linking monomer having a hydrophilic character, in the presence of a phase separator which does not react with the oxirane group. The process of the invention enables the provision of carriers, in bead form, which have high porosity, high surface area, and pores of diameter sufficient for ready penetration by materials bearing active hydrogen. e.g. enzymes.
