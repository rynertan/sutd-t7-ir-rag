# Image sensing and welding arrangement for manipulator welding apparatus.

## Abstract
Programmable welding apparatus with an image sens ing unit and a welding torch hand includes a programmable manipulator apparatus. During a sensing operation the sensing unit emerges from a protective enclosure which surrounds the welding torch and moves linearly downwardly to a sensing position outside the protective enclosure. During the welding operation, the sensing unit is retracted back into the protective enclosure and staging doors, which are pivotally mounted on the bottom edge of the protective enclosure and are closed so as to completely shield the sensing components from the welding fumes and splatter. In addition, when the sensing assembly is in the retracted position within the protective housing, air under pressure is supplied to the interior of the enclosure to provide a purge in the enclosure during the welding cycle to prevent fumes from entering and damaging the optical components of the sensing assembly.
