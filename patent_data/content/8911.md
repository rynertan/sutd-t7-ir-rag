# Improvements in or relating to collapsible conical elements.

## Abstract
A collapsible conical element, particularly in the form of collapsible road marker cone. comprises a base 1 which is preferably relatively heavy, and a coiled strip 4 , preferably of a resilient. plastics material, the outer turn of the strip being restrained from pulling away from the base 1 on extension of the coiled strip 4 to form a cone and the strip 4 having at least two projections, one on each face thereof disposed longitudinally and with the projection on the radially outward face being below the projection on the radially inward face when the cone is in the upright position base down. The base 1 is preferably a substantialiy planar member. eg thick rubber sheeting, with a substantially circu lar aperture 2 within which the outermost turn of the strip is retained, either by virtue only of the resilience of the coiled strip 4 or with additional fixing. It is convenient to have the radially outward projection at the bottom of the strip and to provide a recess around the aperture in the base under which this projection may be trapped. For extending the strip to form a cone a handle 11 may be provided which is insert able within the innermost turn of the coiled strip and which has a flange which will engage the bottom edge of this turn when the handle 11 is pulled upwards. The strip 4 , for road marker use, may bear designs on those surfaces thereof which are exposed when it is extended to form a cone.
