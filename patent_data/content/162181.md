## Description
A METHOD OF INSTALLING MODULAR ELETRIC DEVICESTechnical FieldThis invention relates to a method of installing electric devices direct on external support plates, or the like, in a quick manner.Background ArtSystems are knownto install electric devices also referred to as fruits hereinafter direct on external plates, panels, bases, and the like, without the use of any auxiliary support frame being required.According to a technique know, the fruits are mounted by introducing them into windows provided in a support plate, or the like, from a front side thereof. Fastening of the fruits is usually performed from the rear side, by means of a rectangle shaped, elastic strip of metal material, which surrounds the housing of the associated fruit and is provided with dogs that bite into the mate rial of the housing so as to abut against the back face of the support.Such a method, in addition to being very complicated,never is able to ensure that the fruit is fastened in a very reliable yumerF Moreover, it has many disadvantages In that, for example, the retail strip is likely to be put in tension due to a vire lead having become detached or,vhen the device is a current tap, the risk exists for the enti re device to be pulled out upon withdrawing the associated plug.There are however other fastening methods not utilizing an elastic petal strip, so that sone disadvantages typical of the use of said strip are avoided, but here again couple te avoidance of the above said disadvantages connected with the mentioned nounting method that is introduction of the fruit into the respective window in the support plate fron the front side thereof is not achieved.These other methods of fastening the fruit to the plate utilize interengaging neans which consist of resilient lugs carried by the support plate and provided with teeth or dogs designed to enter corresponding recesses in the fruit housing.It is apparent, therefore, that the risk still exists, particularly in the case of a current tap, for the device to be ejected fron the rear of the support plate, or pulled out of the front thereof, if the plug pins are received with sone fitting interferences in the tap holes.The above dravbacks become the sore significant when considering that fastening reliability of the device relies on skill and accuracy of an installer. It has moreover to be considered that, at leastPdi ing the fruits , the use of a tool is required, and this has to work direct on the housing of the concerned fruit , which involves problems as is well known. Disclo re of the inventionThis invention permits all of the above disadvantages to be eliminated by providing a method of mounting an electric device on a support plate direct, which method well distinguishes from the conventional method of inserting the device into a window in a support plate from the front or the rear side thereof.By the method according to the invention, the risk of an unre liable installation is entirely avoided, since the installa tion does not rely upon the skill of an installer. Moreover, there is no need to use a tool for mounting the device on its support or removing it therefrom.The mounting method according to the invention is characterized in that the electric device, or the so called fruit , is mounted in the window in a respective support plate by introducing it in the direction of the major axis of said window. In order to do so, the support plate is formed of two single parts, namely one lover part that is provided with a row of open top windows, and one upper part that is designed to be located on the lover part so as to complete the support plate. The sidewalls of the windows are formed with vertical opposite grooves extending away from the top ends of said walls and serving as guides for the fruits to be inserted, which latter are provided on their sidewalls with corresponding projections designed to engage said grooves.In order to fit the support plate to a wall, a rectangleshaped support frame is provided and is preferably syMme trical with respect to its major axis, said support france hating recesses and abutting neans provided over its internal boundary faces and designed to releasably engage with corresponding neans carried by the two parts of the support plate.The support france is fastened to an associated wall flush box, or it may even be built on the front edge of this latter.Further features of the nethod for installing nodular, con posable electric devices according to the invention are best understood with the aid of the following description of one eabodjient thereof, which is shown, as a non restric tive example, in the single figure of the accolpanying draw ing, the figure being an exploded, partially sectional view of a counting system for carrying out the nethod according to the invention.nest rode of carrying out the inventionReference will be nade now to the above figure, in which there is indicated by 1 a conventional type of wall flush box designed to receive in the interior thereof the electric devices to be installed. The reference numeral 2 indicates a rectangle shaped frame, which will be also refevr r 1 bv as the support frame, although by this term it is usually meant a frame on which electric devices or fruits are mounted direct.According to the invention, the support frame 2 only serves the purpose of fastening the support plate, and could even be built direct on the front edge 3 of the flush box 1 to be integral with this latter.The support frame 2 may be considered as to be substantially symmetrical to its own principal axes, and this in order to have it fit on the corresponding flush box in a simpler manner.Provided inside each horizontal side see figure of the accompanying drawing of the frame 2, are small vertical paral lel partition walls 4, of which the ones located at the centre form, together with a rising portion 5 of the internal edge of the frame, a U shaped recess 6. Holes 7 are formed in the four corners of the frame, and two of these holes 7 are intended to receive screws therein for fastening the support plate, as will be explained herein below. The frame 2 is fastened to the flush box 1 by means of a pair of screws 8 only one shown which are passed in eloni ated holes 9 in the sidewalls of the frame and then driven into holes 10 provided inside the sidewalls of the flush box 1. One of the two elongated openings 9 is horizontally directed and the other one is arranged vertically so that it is ensured that the frame is located on the associated flush box in accurate registering relationship therewith. According to a basic feature of this invention, the support plate for supporting the electric devices is constructed two two separated parts that are indicated by 11 and 12 in the drawing. The lower part 71 serves as a support proper for the 1fruits to be installed, while the upper part 12, that is of significatly smaller size than said part 11, ser ves the purpose of holding the fruit against any novenent in a vertical direction, and it also gives the plate a finish appearance.The lover part 17 of the support plate has a row of windows 13 provided therein with each window being designed to receive a corresponding fruit or electric component 14. In the example shown, there are four windows and four correspon ding coaponents, namely two sockets and two switches, but it is clearly apparent that the windows say be different in number and that the window row also may comprise only one window. and that, likewise, different types of electric devices such as, for example, changeover switches, pushbuttons, pilot lights, electric bells, fuse carriers, etc., may be housed therein, according to a well knowntechnique of construction of nodular, interchangeable electric devices.If the plate windows are greater in nusbrthan are the fruits that it is desired to mount at the tire of installation,then the empty windows are filled with false fruits , that is to say fruit housings with no fruit therein.As is shown in the figure, the plate windows 13 have no top portions so that they are open upwardly. Provided in each sidewall 15 of windows13 is a pair of vertically directed, front and rear parallel grooves 16 and 17, respectively, which are in facing relationship with the pair of grooves in the opposite wall. Said grooves extend throughout the height of the corresponding wall from the upper edge 18 down to the base 19 of the respective window. LikewIse, each device or fruit 14 has on the sidewall the reof, one or more vertically aligned projections 16 which are designed to engage with the corresponding grooves 16 of a respective window 13, and at least one projection 17 for engagement with a corresponding groove 17. It should be apparent that the projections 16 and 17 could be designed so as to be continuous all along the length of the sidewalls of the concerned fruit.A fruit 14 is thus fitted to the support plate by introducing the fruit into a corresponding window 13 from the above, the projections 16 and 17 being caused to slip down the grooves 16 and 17 that serve as guides for them.Once the fruit having been mounted on part 11 of the support plaMe, iPs w stPenei to the frame 2 by causing a dog format ion 20 provided at a rear central location near the bottom edge of said part, to engage with the U shaped recess 6 in said frame 2, after which the plate part 11 is secured at the top by means of screws 21. The screws 21 are passed through screw holes, 22 in the upper ends of part 11 of the support plate, and then driven into a pair of the holes 7 in the frame 2. In order to fasten the upper part 12 of the support plate, this latter part is provided at the back thereof with resi lient lugs 23 that are arranged in pairs and have dog like formations in opposite relationship to one another, said dogs being designed to engage, following to elastic deform ation of lugs 23, with the back of the partition walls 4 provided on the associated horizontal side of frame 2.Withdrawing of the upper part 12 of the plate is achieved by levering, by means of a tool such as, for example, the sharp edge of a screwdriver, at a relief region 25 that is formed then coupling together the two parts of the plateuntil resistance of the resiliently engaging means 23 24 is overcome.Obviously, all of the components of the mounting system described above, except perhaps the screws 8 and 21, are made from plastic material.It should be apparent that the method of the invention eliinmates all of the drawbacks that are typical of the prior art mounting methods which provided for the fruits to be inserted into the windows in the plate from the front or the rear thereof.In fact, by the design of the present mounting system, there is suppressed the risk that an electricoosponent, such as, for example, a current tap, may be either ejected to the re or pulled out of the front of a corresponding window in the support plate as a result of the exertion of a great er force than the retaining force exerted by the fruitplate engaging means. Also, both the operations of mounting and removing the fruits are made easier, since no tool is required to be used for performing said opetations. Furthermore, the risk of inaccurate installation is elimi nated as vel, since the installer cannot help causing the projections 16 and 17 to slip down the respective guiding grooves 16 and 17 in order to perform the mounting operation.It will be appreciated that many changes, as to the details of construction, may be made to the method of this invention for installing electric devices direct on a support plate, without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention itself.
