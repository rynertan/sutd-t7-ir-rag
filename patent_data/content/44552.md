# Electrically activated high voltage photoflash lamp excluding a press sealed end portion and method of making same.

## Abstract
An electrically activated photoflash lamp 10 which includes a lead glass envelope 11 , a quantity of shredded zirconium or hafnium combustible material 17 within the envelope, a combustion supporting gas e.g., oxygen also within the envelope, and an ignition structure disposed within the envelope for igniting the combustible material upon application of a high voltage, low energy pulse thereto. The ignition structure includes a pair of metallic lead wires 21,23 secured within one end of the envelope and having terminations which lie substantially flush with the interior surface of this end. A quantity of primer material 29 bridges the terminations and is ignited upon application of the above pulse. The lead wires 21,23 are secured and hermetically sealed within the envelope s end 13 without the need for a press sealing operation. A method of making this lamp is also provided.
