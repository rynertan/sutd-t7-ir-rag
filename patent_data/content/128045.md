## Description
The present invention concerns a process for the polymerization of ethylene. More particularly, the invention relates to processes for the polymerization of ethylene to polyethylene having a broad or multimodal molecular weight distribution. It is known that certain metallocenes such as bis cyclopentadienyl titanium or zirconium dialkyls in combination with aluminum alkyl co catalyst, form homogeneous catalyst systems useful for the polymerization of ethylene. German Patent Application 2,608,863 discloses the use of a catalyst system for the polymerization of ethylene consisting of bis cyclopentadienyl titanium dialkyl, aluminum trialkyl and water. German Patent Application 2,608,933 discloses an ethylene polymerization catalyst system consisting of zirconium metallocenes of the general formula cyclopentadienyl European Patent Appln. No. 0035242 discloses a process for preparing ethylene and atactic propylene polymers in the presence of a halogen free Ziegler catalyst system of 1 a cyclopentadienyl compound of the formula cyclopentadienyl The above disclosures demonstrate the usefulness of certain specific metallocenes in combination with certain aluminum compounds for the polymerization of ethylene and particularly polymerization at a high activity. The above described catalysts comprising titanium or zirconium metallocenes being homogeneous, produce polyethylenes of narrow molecular weight distribution MWD i.e. U. S. Patent 4,310,648 discloses a catalytic reaction product of a titanium compound, a zirconium compound, an organomagnesium compound and a halide source. The reaction product a heterogeneous catalyst when employed in combination with aluminum alkyls is useful for the production at high activity of broad molecular weight polyethylenes. U. S. Patent 4,361,685 discloses the use of organic soluble chrominum and zirconium compounds to be employed in combination with a supported catalyst system comprising an organometallic activating agent and a trivalent or tetravalent titanium compound. The polymers obtained have a high molecular weight and a narrow molecular weight distribution. In Molecular Weight Distribution And Stereoregularity Of Polypropylenes Obtained With Ti OC₄H₉ ₄ Al₂ C₂H₃ ₃ Catalyst System It is highly desirable to have for many application, such as an extrusion and molding processes, polyethylenes which have a broad molecular weight distribution of the unimodal and or the multimodal type. Such polyethylenes evidence excellent processability, i.e., they can be processed at a faster throughput rate with lower energy requirements and at the same time such polymers would evidence reduced melt flow perturbations. In view of the foregoing problems, it would be highly desirable to provide a polymerization process of high activity to produce high quality ethylene polymers which evidence broad molecular weight distribution. It is furthermore highly desirable to be able to produce the ethylene polymers directly by a process requiring a single reactor, i.e. without having to blend polyethylenes having different molecular weights and distributions in order to obtain the advantages of this invention. Accordingly there is provided a process for producing polyethylene which comprises polymerising ethylene in the presence of a catalyst system comprising a a common alumoxane as a cocatalyst component and b1 a catalytic amount of a first metallocene having first propagation and termination rate constants suitable for providing, with such alumoxane, a polymer having a narrow MWD with an Mw at a first value and b2 a catalytic amount of a second metallocene having second propagation and termination rate constants different from the first suitable for providing, with such alumoxane a polymer having a narrow MWD with an Mw at a second value different from the first value, said metallocenes being mono, di or tricyclopentadienyl derivatives of a Group 4b, 5b or 6b transition metal and the respective different metallocenes being used as transition metal catalyst component in proportions selected such as to provide a desired broad or multimodal MWD in conjunction with one another. The metallocenes employed in accordance with this invention are organometallic coordination compounds which are cyclopentadienyl derivatives of a transition metal of Group 4b, 5b and 6b metals of the Periodic Table and include mono, di and tricyclopentadienyls and their derivatives of the transition metals. The metallocenes can be represented by the general formula C₅R The present invention especially provides a process for producing polyethylenes having a high molecular weight as well as a multimodal molecular weight distribution and especially MWD of the bimodal type. In the process ethylene may be polymerised alone or with minor amounts of higher alpha olefins. The Mw Mn ratio may be between 2 to 50. In accordance with this invention one can advantageously tailor polyethylene having desired molecular weights and molecular weight distributions by the judicious selection of metallocenes. Figure 1 is a plot of the molecular weight distribution of polyethylene prepared as in Example 1 and in accordance with this invention. Figure 2 is a plot of the molecular weight distribution of polyethylene prepared as in comparative example 1B showing a narrow unimodal MWD. Figure 3 is a plot of the molecular weight distribution of polyethylene prepared as in comparative example 1A showing a narrow unimodal MWD. Figure 4 is a plot of the molecular weight distribution of polyethylene prepared as in example 2 and showing a bimodal MWD. Figure 5 is a plot of the molecular weight distribution of polyethylene prepared as in example 3 showing a bimodal MWD. The present invention is directed towards a process for the catalytic polymerization of ethylene to high molecular weight polyethylenes evidencing a broad and or multimodal molecular weight distribution. The polymers are intended for fabrication into articles by extrusion, injection molding, thermoforming or rotational molding. In particular, the polymers of this invention are homopolymers of ethylene, however, minor amounts of higher alpha olefins having from 3 to 10 carbon atoms and preferably 4 to 8 carbon atoms can be copolymerized with ethylene. Illustrative of the higher alpha olefins are butene 1, hexene 1 and octene 1. In the process of the present invention, ethylene, either alone or together with minor amounts of alpha olefins, is polymerized in the presence of a catalyst system comprising at least two metallocenes and an alumoxane. The alumoxanes are well known in the art and are polymeric aluminum compounds which can be represented by the general formulae R Al O The alumoxanes can be prepared in various ways. Preferably, they are prepared by contacting water with a solution of aluminum trialkyl, such as, for example, aluminum trimethyl, in a suitable organic solvent such as benzene or an aliphatic hydrocarbon. For example, the aluminum alkyl is treated with water in the form of a moist solvent or the aluminum alkyl such as aluminum trimethyl can be desirably contacted with a hydrated salt such as hydrated copper sulfate. Preferably, the alumoxane is prepared in the presence of a hydrated copper sulfate. The method comprises treating a dilute solution of aluminum trimethyl in, for example, toluene, with copper sulfate represented by the general formula CuSO₄.5H₂O. The ratio of copper sulfate to aluminum trimethyl is desirably about 1 mole of copper sulfate for 5 moles of aluminum trimethyl. The reaction is evidenced by the evolution of methane. The metallocenes employed each should have different propagation and termination rate constants with respect to ethylene polymerization. Such rate constants can be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art. The metallocenes are the organometallic coordination compound which are the mono, di and tricyclopentadienyls and their derivatives of a transition metal of Group 4b, 5b and 6b metals of the Periodic Table. The more desirable metallocenes employed in accordance with the invention are represented by the general formula C₅R Exemplary hydrocarbyl radicals are methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, amyl, isoamyl, hexyl, isobutyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl, cetyl, 2 ethylhexyl and phenyl. Exemplary alkylene radicals are methylene, ethylene and propylene. Exemplary halogen atoms include chlorine, bromine and iodine and of these halogen atoms, chlorine is preferred. Exemplary of the alkylidene radicals is methylidene, ethylidene and propylidene. The multiple metallocene system usefully employed in accordance with this invention are preferably the mono, bi and tricyclopentadienyl or substituted cyclopentadienyl titanium IV and zirconium IV compounds represented by the general formula. Illustrative but non limiting examples of the titanocenes which can be usefully employed in accordance with this invention are monocyclopentadienyl titanocenes, such as cyclopentadienyl titanium trichloride, pentamethylcyclopentadienyl titanium trichloride bis cyclopentadienyl titanium diphenyl, the carbene represented by the formula Cp₂Ti CH₂ Al CH₃ ₂Cl, and derivatives of this reagent such as wherein Cp is a cyclopentadienyl or substituted cylopentadienyl radical, and R is an alkyl, aryl or alkylaryl radical having from 1 18 carbon atoms substituted bis Cp Ti IV compounds such as bis indenyl Ti diphenyl or dichloride, bis methylcyclopentadienyl Ti diphenyl or dihalides and other dihalide complexes dialkyl, trialkyl, tetra alkyl and penta alkyl cyclopentadienyl titanium compounds, such as bis 1,2 dimethylcyclopentadienyl Ti diphenyl or dichloride, bis 1,2 diethylcyclopentadienyl Ti diphenyl or dichloride and other dihalide complexes. Illustrative but non limiting examples of the zirconocenes which can be usefully employed in accordance with this invention are monocyclopentadienyl zirconocenes, such as cyclopentadienyl zirconium trichloride, pentamethyl cyclopentadienyl zirconium trichloride bis cyclopentadienyl zirconium diphenyl, bis cyclopentadienyl zirconium dimethyl, the alkyl substituted cyclopentadienes, such as bis ethyl cyclopentadienyl zirconium dimethyl, bis β phenylpropylcyclopentadienyl zirconium dimethyl, bis methylcyclopentadienyl zirconium dimethyl, and dihalide complexes of the above. Di alkyl, tri alkyl, tetra alkyl, and penta alkyl cyclopentadienes, such as bis pentamethylcyclopentadienyl zirconium dimethyl, bis 1,2 dimethylcyclopentadienyl zirconium dimethyl, bis 1,3 diethylcyclopentadienyl zirconium dimethyl and dihalide complexes of the above. Silicon, phosphorus, and carbon bridged cyclopentadiene complexes such as dimethylsilyldicyclopentadienyl zirconium dimethyl or dihalide, methylphosphine dicyclopentadienyl zirconium dimethyl or dihalide, and methylene dicyclopentadienyl zirconium dimethyl or dihalide, carbenes represented by the formulae Cp₂Zr CH₂P C₆H₅ ₂CH₃, and derivatives of these compounds such as Bis cyclopentadienyl hafnium dichloride, bis cyclopentadienyl hafnium dimethyl, bis cyclopentadienyl vanadium dichloride are illustrative of other metallocenes. The ratio of aluminum in the alumoxane to total metal in the metallocenes can be in the range of 0.5 1 to 10⁵ 1, and preferably 5 1 to 10³ 1. The molar ratio of zirconocene to titanocene can vary over a wide range and in accordance with this invention the only limitation on the molar ratios is the breadth of the MW distribution or the degree of bimodality desired in the product polymer. Desirably, the zirconocene to titanocene molar ratio will be 1 100 to 100 1, and preferably 1 10 to 1 1. The solvents used in the preparation of the catalyst system are inert hydrocarbons, in particular a hydrocarbon that is inert with respect to the catalyst system. Such solvents are well known and include, for example, butane, isobutane, pentane, hexane, heptane, octane, cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane, toluene or xylene. The catalyst systems described herein are suitable for the polymerization of ethylene either in solution, slurry or gas phase over a wide range of temperatures and pressures. For example, such temperatures may be in the range of 60 In a solution phase polymerization the alumoxane and metallocene can be employed as a homogeneous catalyst system. The alumoxane is preferably dissolved in a suitable solvent, typically in inert hydrocarbon solvent such as toluene or xylene, in molar concentrations of 0.1M to 3M, however, greater or lesser amounts can be employed. The soluble metallocenes can be converted to supported heterogeneous catalyst by depositing said metallocenes on typical catalyst supports such as, for example, silica, alumina, and polyethylene. The solid catalysts in combination with an alumoxane can be usefully employed in slurry and gas phase olefin polymerization. After polymerization and deactivation of the catalyst, the product polymer can be recovered by processes well known in the art for removal of deactivated catalysts and solution. The solvents may be flashed off from the polymer solution and the obtained polymer extruded into water and cut into pellets or other suitable comminuted shapes. Pigments, antioxidants and other additives, as is known in the art, may be added to the polymer. The polymer product obtained from the process in accordance with this invention will have an average molecular weight in the range of 500 to 2,000,000 and preferably 10,000 to 500,000. The polymer will also have concentrations of average molecular weights in the range of 500 to 100,000 and 100,000 to 1,000,000 for each sample. The polymers produced by the process of this present invention are capable of being fabricated into a wide variety of articles, as is known for homopolymers of ethylene and copolymers of ethylene and higher alpha olefins.
