# RESERVOIR FOR BEARING

## Abstract
A reservoir for gravity feeding lubricant to a bearing, comprising a receptable having a peripheral wall 11, a lower outlet 18 for the outflow of lubricant to the bearing, an annular weir 22 surrounding an inner space 32 around the lower outlet 18 an inlet 16 positioned to feed lubricant into the outer space 30 between the peripheral wall 11 and the weir 22 when the flow of lubricant is low and a bleed passage 28 in the annular weir permitting a limited amount of lubricant to flow between the outer space 30 and the inner space 32, a greater flow of lubricant taking place when the lubricant can pass over the weir either by being projected directly from the inlet 16 and or by lubricant overflowing from the outer space 30 to the inner space 32. This arrangement effectively provides a variable outflow of lubricant depending on the inflow rate.
