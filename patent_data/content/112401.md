# Optical near field scanning microscope.

## Abstract
The optical near field scanning microscope comprises an objective 7 attached to the conventional vertical ad justment appliance 6 and consisting of an optically trans parent crystal having a metal coating with an aperture at its tip with a diameter of less than one wavelength of the light used for illuminating the object 4 . Connected to the aperture far end of the objective 7 is a photodetector 11 via an optical filter 9 and an optical fiber glass cable 10 . Scanning the object 4 is done by appropriately moving the support 3 along x y coordinates. The resolution obtainable with this microscope is about 10 times that of state of the art microscopes.
