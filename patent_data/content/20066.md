# Starter motor.

## Abstract
A starter motor wherein the driven shaft 12 is provided with a brake arrangement including a brake disc 25 carried by the shaft 12. First and second friction members 28, 33 are engageable with opposite faces of the brake disc 25 respectively, and a brake operating member 29 is movable by return movement of the pinion assembly 15 to cause relative movement of the first and second friction members 28, 33 to grip between them the brake disc 25, so generating a braking force.
