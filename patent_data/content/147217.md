## Description
LEUKOTRIENE ANTAGONISTS This invention is directed to compounds which act as antagonists of the leukotrienes. The leukotrienes are a novel group of biologically active mediators derived from arachidonic acid through the action of lipoxygenase enzyme systems. There are two groups of leukotrienes derived from the common unstable precursorLeukotriene A4. The first of these are the peptido lipid leukotrienes, the most important beingLeukotrienes C4 and D4. These compounds collectively account for the biologically active material known as the slow reacting substance of anaphylaxis. The leukotrienes are potent smooth muscle contracting agents, particularly on respiratory smooth muscle but also on other tissues e.g. gall bladder . In addition, they promote mucous production, modulate vascular permeability changes and are potent inflammatory agents in human skin.The most important compound in the second group of leukotrienes is Leukotriene B4, a dihydroxy fatty acid. This compound is a potent chemotactic agent for neutrophils and eosinophils and in addition, may modulate a number of other functions of these cells.It also effects other cell types such as lymphocytes and for example may modulate the action ofT suppressor cells and natural killer cells. When injected in vivo, in addition to promoting the accumulation of leukocytes, Leukotriene B4 is also a potent hyperalgesic agent and can modulate vascular permeability changes through a neutrophil dependent mechanism. Both groups of leukotrienes are formed following oxygenation of arachidonic acid through the action of a 5 lipoxygenase enzyme. See for example,D. M. Bailey et al., Ann. Rpts. Med. Chem. 17 203 1982 . The leukotrienes are potent spasmogens of humantrachea, bronchus and lung parenchymal strips, and when administered to normal volunteers as aerosols are 3,800 times more potent that histamine at inducing a 50 decrease in air flow at 30 of vital capacity. They mediate increases in vascular permeability in animals and promote mucous production in human bronchial explants. In addition,Leukotriene B4 may also mediate mucous production and could be an important mediator of neutrophil and eosinophil accumulation in asthmatic lungs.5 lipoxygenase products are also thought to be regulators of mast cell degranulation and recent studies with human lung mast cells have suggested that 5 lipoxygenase inhibitors, but not corticosteroids, may suppress antigen induced mast cell degranulation. In vitro studies have shown that antigen challenge of human lung results in the release of leukotrienes and in addition purified human mast cells can produce substantial amount of leukotrienes. There is therefore good evidence that leukotrienes are important mediators of human asthma. Leukotriene antagonists or inhibitors would therefore be a new class of drugs for the treatment of asthma. Psoriasis is a human skin disease which effects between two and six percent of the population. There is no adequate therapy for psoriasis and related skin conditions. The evidence for leukotriene involvement in these diseases is as follows. One of the earliest events in the development of preparpillary lesions is the recruitment of leukocytes to the skin site.Injection of Leuko triene B4 into human skin results in a pronounced neutrophil accumulation.There are gross abnormalities in arachidonic acid metabolism in human psoriatic skin. In particular, highly elevated levels of free arachidonic acid can be measured as well as large amounts of lipoxygenase products. Leukotriene B4 has been detected in psoriatic lesions, but not in uninvolved skin, in biologically significant amounts. Leukotrienes can be measured in nasal washings from patients with allergic rhinitis and are greatly elevated following antigen challenge.Leukotrienes may mediate this disease through their ability to regulate mast cell degranulation, by modulating mucous production and mucocillary clearance and by mediating the accumulation of inflammatory leukocytes. Leukotrienes can also mediate other diseases. These include atopic dermatitis, gouty arthritis and gall bladder spasms. In addition, they may have a role in cardiovascular disease because leukotrienes C4 and D4 act as coronary and cerebral arterial vasoconstrictors and these compounds may also have negative inotropic effects on the myocardium. In addition, the leukotrienes are important mediators of inflammatory diseases through their ability to modulate leukocyte and lymphocyte function. See for example, B. Samuelsson, Science, 220 568 1983 . Several classes of compounds exhibit ability to antagonize the action of leukotrienes in mammals, especially humans. See for example United KingdomPatent Specification Nos. 2,058,785 and 2,094,301 and European Patent Application Nos. 56,172, 61,800 and 68,739. The present invention relates to compounds having activity as leukotriene and SRS A antagonists or inhibitors, to methods for their preparation, to intermediates useful in their preparation and to methods and pharmaceutical formulations for using these compounds in mammals especially humans . Because of their activity as leukotriene antagonists or inhibitors, the compounds of the present invention are useful as anti asthmatic, anti allergic,and anti inflammatory agents and are useful in treating allergic rhinitis and chronic bronchitis and for amelioration of skin diseases like psoriasis and atopic eczema. These compounds are also useful to antagonize or inhibit the pathologic actions of leukotrienes on the cardiovascular and vascular systems for example, actions such as result in angina The compounds are also useful as cytoprotective agents. Thus, the compounds of the present invention may also be used to treat or prevent mammalian especially, human disease states such as erosive gastritis erosive esophagitis inflammatory bowel disease ethanol induced hemorrhagic erosions hepatic ischemia noxious agent induced damage or necrosis of hepatic, pancreatic, renal, or myocardial tissue liver parenchymal damage caused by hepatoxic agents such as CC14 and D galactosamine ischemic renal failure disease induced hepatic damage bile salt induced pancreatic or gastric damage trauma or stress induced cell damage and glycerol induced renal failure.

Both the salt and lactone forms of the Formula I compounds are embraced within the present invention. EMI11.1 A preferred group of compounds is represented by Formula III EMI11.2 wherein X is 0 or S,R is as defined for Formula I,RÚ is COOR11, CH2OH, CHO or tetrazole,EMI11.3 EMI12.1 orR is as defined for Formula I R11 is as defined for Formula I and a is as defined for Formula I. More preferred are the Formula III compounds wherein R1 is COORll or CH2OH. The compounds of Formula I may be prepared by any process available to the skilled artisan.According to one method outlined in Scheme I racemicLTA4 methyl ester, IV, Rokach et al., TetrahedronLetters, 21, 1485 1489 1980 is reacted with a suitable thiol in a solvent such as methanol, t butanol and the like in the presence of a base such as a trialkylamine, to yield compound V Cfr, Holme, et al., Prostaglandins, 20, 717 727 1980 . The temperature of the reaction may be between 100C and 60 C, and it is conveniently carried out between 200 and 300C. The reaction time may vary from 15 minutes to 6 hours, and the reaction progress may be followed by thin layer chromatography.Hydrolysis of the ester V is effected under the general conditions described by Rokach et al., Tetrahedron Letters, 21, 1485 1489 1980 , at temperatures ranging from 100C to 500C and preferably at as low a temperature as possible and which causes hydrolysis in a reasonable time, ranging from 1 hour to 5 days depending upon the particular compound. The salts are removed from the resulting solution of I by passage through a column of XAD resin, from which the product is obtained in the form of its potassium or sodium salt depending upon the base used for hydrolysis. In this method the trans LTA4 methyl ester gives rise to the racemic erythro form of I and the cis isomeryields the racemic threo isomer of I. SCHEME IEMI14.1 In Scheme II is illustrated a method of obtaining the optically active forms of compound I.In one method, compound VI Rokach et al.,Tetrahedron Letters, 22, 2759 2762 1981 is reacted with an alkylphosphonium salt, in the presence of an alkyl lithium to form an ylid species, in an unreactive solvent such as tetrahydrofuran at temperatures ranging from 780C to 250C, preferably from 200C to l00C, for from 30 minutes to 6 hours, depending upon the progress of the reaction which is followed by thin layer chromatography. Compound VII is converted to VIII and to I as in Scheme I. In order to prepare the Formula I compounds with 2 or 3 double bonds, compound IX is prepared from VI according to the procedure of Rokach, et al.,Tetrahedron Letters, 22, 979 982 1981 . CompoundIX, where m is 1 or 2, is then converted to intermediates X and XI and finally hydrolyzed to I, as described previously. By starting with any of the four possible optical isomers of VI, there can thus be obtained the four optically isomeric forms of the Formula I compounds.

As will be appreciated, the compounds ofFormula I possess chiral centers at C5 and C6 and, accordingly, exist in the stereoisomere forms 5R, 6R 5S, 6S SR, 6S and 5S, 6R. Other chiral centers are also possible, depending on the nature of the substituents R, R1 and R2, leading to further stereoisomeric forms. Further, where the compounds contain alkenyl substituents, for example as in R, cis trans isomeric forms exist. It is not intended that the present invention be limited to any particular isomeric form. A further embodiment of the present invention are pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of the Formula XII EMI17.3 wherein R and R1 areas defined for Formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and the jagged bond indicates that both cis and trans isomers exist. Compounds of Formula XII are useful in inhibiting the biosynthesis of leukotrienes, and in particular the biosynthesis of leukotriene B4. Particularly preferred compounds of FormulaXII are those in which R does not contain three conjugated double bonds and in which R1 is COOR8 wherein R8 is H or alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms.Examples of such preferred compounds are the novel compounds of Formula XII identified below and in addition, the following two compounds Methyl S S trans 5,6 oxido 7 Z eicosenoate Methyl 5 S trans 5,6 oxido 7 E ,9 Z eicosadienoate When a salt form of compound XII is desired it is prepared by standard hydrolysis of XII ester.Typical conditions involve dissolving XII ester in methanol, adding 2N aqueous NaOH and stirring at room temperature for 2 hours to obtain a solution of XII salt. The following compounds of the Formula XII are novel compounds Methyl trans 5,6 oxidoeicos 7 ynoate Ethyl 5 S trans 5,6 oxidoeicos 7 ynoate Ethyl 5 S cis 5,6 oxidoeicos 7 ynoate Ethyl 5 S trans 5,6 oxidoeicos 9 E ene 7 ynoate Methyl trans 5,6 oxidoeicosa 7 E , 9 E dienoate Ethyl 5 S trans 5,6 oxidoeicosa 7 E , 9 E dienoate Ethyl 5 S trans 5,6 oxidoeicosa 7 E , 9 E , 14 Z trienoate Sodium 5 S trans 5,6 oxidoeicos 7 E enoate Sodium 5 S trans 5,6 oxidoeicosa 7 E ,9 Z dienoate Sodium trans 5,6 oxidoeicos 7 ynoate Sodium 5 5 trans 5,6 oxidoeicos 7 ynoate Sodium 5 S cis 5,6 oxidoeicos 7 ynoate Sodium 5 S trans 5,6 oxidoeicos 9 E ene 7 ynoate Sodium trans 5,6 oxidoeicosa 7 E , 9 E dienoate. Sodium 5 S trans 5,6 oxidoeicosa 7 E , 9 E dienoate and Sodium 5 S trans 5,6 oxidoeicosa 7 E , 9 E , 14 Z trienoate. The compounds of Formula I are active as antagonists of SRS A and the leukotrienes B4, C4,D4 and E4. These compounds also have modest inhibitory activity on leukotriene biosynthesis but are primarily of therapeutic interest as antagonists. The compounds of the Formula XII are active as leukotriene inhibitors. The activity of the compounds of Formulae I and XII can be detected and evaluated by methods known in the art. See for example, Kadin, U.S. Patent No. 4,296,129. The ability of the compounds of Formula I to antagonize the effects of the leukotrienes and the ability of the compounds of the Formula XII to inhibit the leukotrienes makes them useful for inhibiting the symptoms induced by the leukotrienes in a human subject. The compounds are valuable therefore in the prevention and treatment of such disease states in which the leukotrienes are the causative factor, e.g. skin disorders, allergic rhinitis, and obstructive airway diseases. The compounds are particularly valuable in the prevention and treatment of allergic bronchial asthma. It will be understood that in this paragraph and in the discussion of methods of treatment which follows, references to the compounds of Formula I or XII are meant to include the pharmaceutically acceptable salts and lactone forms. The cytoprotective activity of a compound may be observed in both animals and man by noting the increased resistance of the gastrointestinal mucosa to the noxious effects of strong irritants, for example, the ulcerogenic effects of aspirin or indomethacin. In addition to lessening the effect of non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs on the gastrointestinal tract, animal studies show that cytoprotective compounds will prevent gastric lesions induced by oral administration of strong acids, strong bases, ethanol, hypertonic saline solutions and the like. Two as says can be used to measure cytoprotective ability. These assays are A an ethanolinduced lesion assay and B an indomethacin induced ulcer assay. A. Ethanol Induced Gastric Ulcer Assay Twenty four hour fasted Sprague Dawley S.D. rats are perorally p.o. dosed with 1.0 ml absolute ethanol. Fifteen to thirty minutes prior to ethanol administration, groups of rats each receive either an aqueous vehicle aqueous methylcellulose 5 wt. or the test compound at various doses perorally. One hour later, the animals are sacrificed and stomach mucosae are examined for resulting lesions. B. Indomethacin Induced Ulcer Assay Indomethacin, 10 mg kg p.o., is used to induce ulcers in 24 hour fasted S.D. rats. Fifteen minutes prior to indomethacin administration, groups of rats each receive either an aqueous vehicle 5 by weight methylcellulose or the test compound at various doses perorally. Four hours later the animals are sacrificed and stomach mucosae are examined for resulting ulcers. The magnitude of a prophylactic or therapeutic dose of a compound of Formula I or XII will, of course, vary with the nature ofthe severity of the condition to be treated and with the particular compound of Formula I or XII and its route of administration. It will also vary according to the age, weight and response of the individual patient. In general, the daily dose range for anti asthmatic, anti allergic or anti inflammatory use and generally, uses other than cytoprotection, lie within the range of from about 0.1 mg to about 40 mg per kg body weight of a mammal, preferably 0.2 mg to about 20 mg per kg, and most preferably 1 to 10 mg per kg, in single or divided doses. On the other hand, it may be necessary to use dosages outside these limits in some cases. The exact amount of a compound of theFormula I or XII to be used as a cytoprotective agent will depend on, inter alia, whether it is being administered to heal damaged cells or to avoid future damage, on the nature of the damaged cells e.g., gastrointestinal ulcerations vs. nephrotic necrosis , and on the nature of the causative agent. An example of the use of a compound of the Formula I or XII in avoiding future damage would be co administration of a compoundof the Formula I or XII with a nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug that might otherwise cause such damage for example, indomethacin . For such use, the compound of Formula I or XII is administered from 30 minutes prior up to 30 minutes after administration of the NSAID. Preferably it is administered prior to or simultaneously with theNSAID, for example, in a combination dosage form . The effective daily dosage level for compounds of Formula I or XII inducing cytoprotection in mammals, especially humans, will generally range from about 0.02 mg kg to about 40 mg kg, preferably from about 0.2 mg kg to about 20 mg kg. The dosage may be administered in single or divided individual doses. Any suitable route of administration may be employed for providing a mammal, especially a human with an effective dosage of a leukotriene antagonist.For example, oral, rectal, transdermal, parenteral, intramuscular, intravenous and the like may be employed.Dosage forms include tablets, troches, dispersions, suspensions, solutions, capsules and the like. The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention comprise a compound of Formula I orXII as an active ingredient or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and may also contain a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and optionally other therapeutic ingredients. The term pharmaceutically acceptable salts refers to salts prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non toxic bases including inorganic bases and organic bases.Salts derived from inorganic bases include sodium, potassium, lithium, ammonium, calcium, magnesium, ferrous, zinc, copper, manganous, aluminum, ferric, manganic salts and the like. Particularly preferred are the ammonium, potassium, sodium, calcium and magnesium salts. Salts derived from pharmaceutically acceptable organic non toxic bases include salts of primary, secondary, and tertiary amines, substituted amines including naturally occurring substituted amines, cyclic amines and basic ion exchange resins, such as isopropylamine, trimethylamifle, diethylamine, triethylamine, tripropylamine, ethanolamine, 2 dimethylaminoethanol, 2 diethylaminoethanol, tromethamine, lysine, arginine, histidine, caffeine, procaine, hydrabamine, choline, betaine, ethylenediamine, glucosamine, methylglucamine, theobromine, purines, piperazine, piperidine, N ethylpiperidine, polyamine resins and the like. The compositions include compositions suitable for oral, rectal, ophthalmic, pulmonary, nasal, dermal, topical or parenterpl including subcutaneous, intramuscular and intravenous administration, although the most suitable route in any given case will depend on the nature and severity of the conditions being treated and on the nature of the active ingredient. They may be conveniently presented in unit dosage form and prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. For use where a composition for intravenous administration is employed, a suitable dosage range for anti asthmatic, anti inflammatory or antiallergic use is from about 0.1 mg to about 20 mg preferably from about 0.1 mg to about 10 mg of a compound of formula I per .kg of body weight per day and for cytoprotective use from about 0.02 mg to about 40 mg preferably from about 0.2 mg to about 20 mg and more preferably from about 1 mg to about 10 mg of a compound of Formula I or XII per kg of body weight per day.In the case where an oral composition is employed, a suitable dosage range for antiasthmatic, anti inflammatory or anti allergic use is, e.g. from about 1 mg to about 40 mg of d compound of formula I per kgdf ,budp weight per day, preferably from about 5 mg to about 20 mg per. kg and for cytoprotective use from about 0.2 mg to about 40 mg preferably from about 0.2 mg to about 20 mg and more preferably from about 0. .Z mg to about 10 mg of a compound of Formula .r XII per kg of body weight per day. For administration by inhalation, the compounds of the present invention are conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray presentation from pressurized pack or a nebuliser. The preferred composition for inhalation is a powder which may be formulated as a cartridge from which the powder composition may be inhaled with the aid of a suitable device. In the case of a pressurized aerosol, the dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. In practical use, the compounds of Formula I or XII can be combined as the active ingredient in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. The carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration, e.g., oral or intravenous. In preparing the compositions for oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed, such as, for example, water glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations, such as, for example, suspensions, elixirs and solutions or carriers such as starches, sugars, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of oral solid preparations such as, for example, powders, capsules and tablets. Because of their ease of administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit form, in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. If desired, tablets may be sugar coated or enteric coated by standard techniques. In addition to the common dosage forms set out above, the compounds of Formula I or XII may also be administered by controlled release means and or delivery devices such as those described in U.S.Patent Nos. 3,845,770 3,916,899 3,536,809 3,598,123 3,630,200 and 4,008,719, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention suitable for oral administration and by inhalation in the case of asthma therapy may be presented as discrete units such as capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient, as a powder or granules or as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous liquid, a non aqueous liquid, an oil in water emulsion or a water in oil liquid emulsion. Such compositions may be prepared by any of the methods of pharmacy but all methods include the step of bringing into association the active ingredient with the carrier which constitutes one or more necessary ingredients. In general, the compositions are prepared by uniformly and intimately admixing the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired presentation.For example, a tablet may be prepared by compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine, the active ingredient in a free flowing form such as powder or granules, optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, lubricating, surface active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine, a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. Desirably, each tablet contains from about 25 mg to about 500 mg of the active ingredient and each cachet or capsule contains from about 25 to about 500 mg of the active ingredient. The following are examples of representative pharmaceutical dosage forms for the compounds of Formula I or XII Injectable Suspension mg mlCompound of Formula I or XII 2.0Methylcellulose 5.0Tween 80 0.5Benzyl alcohol 9.0Methyl paraben 1.8Propyl paraben 0.2Water for injection to a total volume of 1 mlTablet mg tabletCompound of Formula I or XII 25.0Microcrystalline Cellulose 325.0Providone 14.0Microcrystalline Cellulose 90.0Pregelatinized Starch 43.5Magnesium Stearate 2 2.5 500Capsule mg capsuleCompound of Formula I or XII 25.0Lactose Powder 573.5Magnesium Stearate 1.5 600 In addition to the compounds of Formula I orXII, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can also contain other active ingredients, such as cyclooxygenase inhibitors, non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs NSAIDs , peripheral analgesic agents such as zomepirac diflunisal and the like. The weight ratio of the compound of theFormula I or XII to the second active ingredient may be varied and will depend upon the effective dose of each ingredient. Generally, an effective dose of each will be used. Thus, for example, when a compound of the Formula I or XII is combined with anNSAID the weight ratio of the compound of the FormulaI or XII to the NSAID will generally range from about 200 1 to about 1 200. Combinations of a compound of the Formula I or XII and other active ingredients will generally also be within the aforementioned range, but in each case, an effective dose of each active ingredient should be used.
