## Description
THIS INVENTION relates to the interconnecting of low energy fuses, in particular low energy fuses such as that known by the trademark NONEL . Low energy fuses of this type comprise plastics tubing containing a suitable explosive material. According to one aspect of the invention, there is provided a connector for interconnecting at least two lengths of low energy fuse of the type described, for transferring a shock wave front of an explosion propagating along one length of fuse to the other length of fuse which includes a hollow tubular connecting means which defines a passage and which is insertable into the lengths of fuse so that the interior of a first length of fuse is in flow communication with the interior of a second length of fuse via the passage of the connecting means and a retaining means for retaining the connecting means in position relative to the lengths of fuse. It will be appreciated that two or more lengths of fuse may be interconnected. Thus, the connecting means may have two or more end portions, dependent on the number of lengths of tubing that are to be interconnected. The connecting means may include at least one needle like portion having a pointed end for piercing a wall of at least one of the lengths of fuse. In one embodiment of the invention, the needle like portion may have a second end remote from the pointed end, which second end is fast with the retaining means, the pointed end of the needle like portion being insertable through the walls of the two lengths of fuse when the lengths of fuse are arranged adjacent one another with their longitudinal axes parallel to one another. In another embodiment of the invention the needle like portion may have a second end that is also pointed, so that one of the pointed ends of the needle like portion is insertable through the wall of one of the lengths of fuse and the other pointed end of the needle like portion is insertable through the wall of the other length of fuse, the lengths of fuse being spaced from each other, in use. The passage of the connecting means, may, if desired, contain a primary and or a secondary explosive. The passage may also contain a pyrotechnic delay The retaining means may comprise a body defining at least one seat in which a connecting region of at least one of the lengths of fuse is receivable for securely retaining the connecting means in position relative to the length of fuse. The retaining means may further comprise at least one end cap which is releasably engageable with the body. In one form of the connector a chamber may be defined in the body and the needle like portion of the connecting means may comprise two hollow elements, each having a pointed end and each projecting from the chamber, the pointed end of one element projecting out of the seat defined by the body and the pointed end of the other element projecting out of another seat defined by the body. The lengths of fuse may be interconnected with one another intermediate their ends. Instead, the end of one length of fuse may be interconnected with another length of fuse intermediate its ends, in a T configuration. With this arrangement, one end portion of a connecting means that is received within an end of the fuse will be co linear therewith and the other end portion of the connecting means will be inserted into the other length of fuse in a transverse manner. Further, if two lengths of fuse are to be interconnected with one another intermediate their ends then the end portions of the connecting means will be transversely located with respect to the lengths of fuse. It will also be understood that two lengths of fuse may be interconnected intermediate their ends with the lengths of fuse being either parallel, or transverse. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that there will not be any problem in inserting an end portion of the connecting means into an end of the fuse. However, if the end portion of the connecting means is to be inserted into the length of fuse intermediate its ends then the end portion must pass through a wall of the fuse so that an opening into the end portion is located within the length of fuse. This may be accomplished by either first forming a hole in the wall of the fuse and then inserting the end portion, or by adapting the end portion so that it forms a hole as it is inserted through the wall of the fuse. The pointed end of the connecting means may provide an angled opening, the angled opening facing in a suitable direction. Thus, it may face transversely with respect to the length of fuse or longitudinally. The invention is now described, by way of examples, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Referring to Figures 1 to 3, a connector in accordance with the invention for connecting at least two lengths of low energy fuse for transferring a shock wave front of an explosion propagating along one length of fuse to the other length of fuse is designated generally by the reference numeral 10. The connector 10 is used for interconnecting two lengths of fuse 12 and 14. Each fuse 12, 14 comprises a length of tubing 16 having its inner walls coated with an explosive powder to form a low energy fuse such as that known by the trade mark NONEL . The connector 10 comprises a hollow tubular connecting means 18 which is pointed at both ends 20 and 22. Secured to the connecting means 18 intermediate its ends is a collar 24 made of a plastics material. The collar 24 has abutment shoulders 26 on each side. Secured to the collar 24 and extending past and around the pointed ends 20 and 22 are two clips 28 and 30 which are formed integrally with the collar 24. The clips 28 and 30 together with the abutment shoulders 26 of the collar 24 define seats 32 for securely retaining the length of tubing 16 in position relative to the connecting means 18. The clips 28 and 30 are made of a suitably resilient material so that they can be bent back, the fuses 12 and 14 can be engaged with the ends 20 and 22 of the connecting means 18 so that the ends 20 and 22 pierce the tubing 16 of the fuses 12 and 14 respectively to extend into the tubing 16. The clips 28 and 30 can then be released to engage with the tubing 16 of the fuses 12 and 14 to secure them to the connecting means 18. Referring now to Figure 4 another embodiment of the invention is shown. In this embodiment of the invention, two lengths of fuse 40 and 42 are inter connected by means of a connector 44 which comprises a short length of metal tube.
