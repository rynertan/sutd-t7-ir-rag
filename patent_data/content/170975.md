## Description
TITLE OF THE INVENTION SPARK PLUGBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the Invention This invention relates to an improvement of spark plugs employed in a high voltage ignition circuit of an internal combustion engine and more particularly to decrease of an energy loss and to an effective suppression of radio noises generated from the spark plug.Description of the Prior Art High frequency noise currents generated from a spark plug can be suppressed, for example, by means of a high frequency radio wave absorbing circuit which is made by connecting a resistor in series with a terminal metal member fitted to an end of an internal passage of the spark plug and a center electrode fitted in the other end of the internal passage. Conventionally, a mixture of carbon, zirconia or alumina or magnesia and glass baked to the internal passage of a spark plug has been known for the resistor.As illustrated in Fig.7, this resistor comprises a high resistive glass 42 and carbon conductor forming a current path 43 in a zigzag shape in order to improve a noise current suppression effect. The noise current suppression effect by means of the zigzag shape of the current path 43 is hereinafter referred to as a structural effect . In addition, zirconia helps carbon forming the current path 43 adhere to glass 42 and thereby reduces the irregularity of resistance and improves the durability of the resistor. The radio noise suppression effect of the resistor composed of carbon, zirconia and glass, however, is not sufficient. Especially in view of an increasiny use of electronic equipments mounted in vehicles and increasing requirements for precision thereof in recent years, a further improvement in radio noise suppression is being called for. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of this invention, therefore, to provide a spark plug with a more enhanced radio noise suppression effect by improving the above resistor. According to this invention, a magnetic substance is added to the resistor in order to enhance the absorption of high frequency noise currents. With reference to Fig.l showing a sectional view of a spark plug of this invention and Fig.2 showing the composition of the resistor utilized in the spark plug, the spark plut3 of this invention comprises an insulator 1 having an internal passage extended in the axial direction of the spark plug, a terminal metal member 2 fitted to an open end portion of the internal passage, a center electrode 3 fitted to the other open end portion of the internal passage, and a resistor 4 positioned between the terminal metal member 2 and the center electrode 3 inside the internal passage, the resistor 4 is made of a sintered material comprising, by weight, 0.2 0.6 carbon, 25 75 glass of which the softening temperatures are 300 6000C and the particle diameters are 10 500cm,0.4 40 z magnetic substance and a binder constituting the rest. Except for the resistor 4, conventional structural members may be used for such parts of the spark plug of this invention as the insulator 1, terminal metal member 2 and central electrode 3. The structure of the resistor 4 is considered to become like the one shown in Fig.2 comprising glass 42 of which particle sizes are about 10 S0Ofi m, magnetic substance 41 and current path 43 mainly made of carbon and formed in a zigzag shape. The carbon is dispersed by the binder to adhere well to the glass 42 and magnetic substance 41. Materials such as zirconia, alumina, magnesia and glass of which grain sizes are less than about 5 m may be employed for the binder. The magnetic substance 41 absorbs high frequency noise currents, i.e., the magnetic substance 41 reduces high frequency noise currents by converting the energy of the noise currents to the magnetization energy of the spin of the magnetic substance 41 and or to a joule heat. Therefore, the relative permeability of the magnetic substance 41 is required to be more than 10. The following may be used for the magnetic substance 41.a. Ferrite of a reverse spinel structure composed of MIIO . Fe2Os beryllium Be , manganese Mn , iron Fe , cobalt Co , nickel Ni , copper Cu , zinc Zn , magnesium Mg , cadmium Cd , lithium Li or a compound material thereof is employed for the bivalent metal b. Hexagonal crystal ferrite such as BaO 6Fe2O3, PbO 6FeQ and SrO 6FeO. c. a compound of the a and the b d. garnet ferrite 3R2O3 5Fe2O3 yttrium Y , samarium Sm , europium Eu , cadmium Cd , terbium Tb , dysprosium Dy , holmium Ho , erbium Er , thulium Tm , ytterbium Yb and lutetium Lu are employed for the R. The proportion of the magnetic substance to the resistor is limited to 0.4 40 wt . When less than 0.4 wt magnetic substance is contained in the resistor, the resistor could not show the above effects. On the other hand, when more than 40 wtt magnetic susbtance is contained, due to the large energy loss at a low frequency, the performance is deteriorated. Further, particle diameters of the magnetic substance are limited to 10 300 m. When particle diameters of the magnetic substance are less than 10 m, the magnetic substance melts into the glass by its reaction with the glass in a heating process and thereby causes its magnetic property to be lost, its absorption of high frequency noise currents to decrease and its magnetic domain to be lost. Should particle diameters of the magnetic substance be larger than 300 m, a gap tends to occur between the magnetic substance and the glass because the glass softens at a high temperature while the magnetic substance does not, and thus the stability and durability of the resistor 4 decrease. In addition, the specific resistance of the magnetic substance should exceed 10 1 ohm cm. When the specific resistance is less than 10 ohmcm, the magnetic substance becomes conductive and thus the current path of the resistor 4 becomes too wide to obtain the aforesaid structural effect. The glass 42 is considered to work as an obstacle to electric currents and forms the current path 43 in a zigzag shape. The softening temperatures of the glass 42 should be about 300 6000C. The softening temperature of the glass 42 is preferably more than about 3000 C because the spark plug is heated to about 2500C in its use. And the temperature is preferably less than 600 0 C in order to weld the resistor 4 inside the insulator 1 without oxidizing the terminal metal member 2 and the center electrode 3. Such glass as lithium Li glass, silica SiO2 glass, borosilicate glass not including lithia Li2O , and soda zinc glass may be employed for the glass 42. Proportion of the glass to the resistor 4 is limited to 25 75 wt . The aforesaid structural effect cannot be obtained sufficiently when the glass content in the resistor 4 is not more than 25 wt and the amount of the magnetic substance 41 contained in the resistor 4 becomes too little if the glass content exceeds 75 wt . Grain sizes of the glass 42 are preferably about 10 500 m. m. Should the grain diameters be less than 10yt m, the glass 42 tends to soften in a normal use of the spark plug, and thereby the current path becomes unstable, and should the grain diameters exceed 500 m, a gap tends to occur between the glass and the current path when the resistor 4 is being welded inside the insulator 1. The current path 43 comprising 0.2 0.6 wt carbon conductor and a binder constituting the rest are formed in a zigzag shape around the glass 42 and the magnetic substance 41. The spark pluy of this invention is manufactured by filliny and sintering and welding the resistor 4 between the terminal metal member 2 and the center electrode 3 inside the insulator 1. The welding temperatures are generally about 9000C. The spark plug of this invention includes the glass 42 and magnetic substance 41 which work as obstacles to radio noise currents and form the current path 43 in a zigzay shape and thereby provides the aforesaid structural effect. Further the magnetic substance 41 suppresses generation of radio noise currents by absorbing high frequency noise currents as mentioned before.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The exact nature of this invention, as well as other objects and advantages thereof, will be apparent from the consideration of the following specific particularly when considered in connection with the accompanying drawings in which Fig.l is a cross sectional view showing the practical structure of the spark plug according to the embodiment of the present invention Fig.2 is a structural view showing the microscopic structure of the resistor employed in the sprak plug of the present invention Fig.3 is a graph showing the measurement of the frequency characteristics of intensity of the noisefield radiated from the sprak plug according to the embodiment of the present invention in comparison with the conventional spark plug Fig.4 is a graph illustrating the noise suppression effect of various magnetic substances added in the resistor Fig.5 is a graph illustrating the noise suppression effects of magnetic substances with various particle sizes added in the resistor Fig.6 is a schematic illustration showing a measurement method of noise field intensity Fig.7 is a structural view showing the microscopic structure of the resistor employed in the conventional spark plug Fig.8 is a graph showing the measurement of the noise suppression effect using resistors with varied composition ratio of ferrite and Fig.9 shows the composition of the resistor of the present invention.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The present invention is explained hereunder in detail with a description of a preferred embodiment thereof. An embodiment of the spark plug of this invention and comparative models were manufactured as follows. All of the spark plugs are shaped as illustrated in Fig.l. A mixture of carbon, glass whose grain size was 5ym m and zirconia at a proportion of 1 7.5 29 were dry grounded for 2 hours by means of a vibration mill to produce a material for the current path. The glass was composed, by weight, of 52 SiO2, 7 CaO, 37 B2OS, and 4 Lino. Thereupon, 22.5 t current path material thus prepared,72.5 glass whose grain size is 200Xxm, and 5 nickel zinc ferrite, by weight, were mixed together with a dextrine aqueous solution and a carboxymethylcellulose aqueous solution. And then the mixture was dried and sieved to obtain a resistor material whose grain size was 200 m. The nickel zinc ferrite was composed of 35 mol NiO, 15 mol ZnO, and 50 mol Fe2O. In place of the nickel zinc ferrite, resistor materials respectively made of super permalloy and zinc oxide ferrite were also manufactured for the purpose of comparison as shown in a table.

Fig.8 is a graph showing the measurement of the noise suppression effect using the resistors. The center electrode 3 was inserted in the lower end of the internal passage of the insulator 1 alumina , then 0.26 g of copper glass which was a mixture of glass composed, by weight,of 64 SiO2, 6 A12Os , 23 B203and 7 Na2O and copper powder at a proportion of 1 1 was filled on the center electrode 3, then a pressure of 1,400 kg cm was applied onto the copper glass, then 0.5 g of the above mentioned resistor material was added on the copper glass and a pressure was applied thereon in two successive process, then 0.46 g of the copper glass was placed on the resistor material, and then a pressure of 1,100 kg cm was applied on the copper glass by means of terminal nut.Then the spark plug was placed in a furnace for thirty minutes at a temperature of 8700C to soften the glass contained in the materials of the copper glass and resistor. Then the spark plug was taken out of the furnace and a pressure of 1,000 kg cm was applied onto the terminal nut, and thereby the resistor material became the resistor 4 and the two pieces of copper glass become respectively the copper glass electrodes 51 and 52. In addition, the resistance value of the resistor 4 was controlled to comply with Japanese IndustrialStandard JIS . After the insulator 1 was cooled, the housing 6 haviny an earth electrode 8 was placed around the insulator 1 to obtain the spark plug shown in Fig.l. For the purpose of comparison, a conventional spark plug A was also manufactured in the same process.The resister of the conventional spark plug A was composed, by weight, of 0.9 carbon, 22.5 zirconia, 4.5 glass whose grain sizes are small, and 72.5 glass whose grain sizes are large. The noise field intensity was measured with each spark plug to evaluate its noise suppressing effect. The results are shown in Figs.3 5. To measure the noise field intensity of the spark plugs, each spark plug was placed under 4 barometric pressures approximately equivalent to the pressure in an engine. Then a discharge aging was done for several minutes at a rotation of 2,000 rpm. Thereupon, noise field intensity was measured at various frequencies by means of a noise measuring apparatus shown in Fig.6. And, the measured values shown in Fig.3 5 were maximum values measured at each frequency. With reference to Fig.3 showing the noise field intensity of the embodiment of the spark plug of this invention and the comparative model A, the noise field intensity of the embodiment is distinctly lower than that of the comparative model A at every frequency.Accordingly, the radio noise suppressing effect is enhanced by the spark plug of this invention. Referring now to Fig.4 showing the noise suppression effects of the spark plugs, each of which is made of one of the five kinds of magnetic substances with different specific resistances and relative permeabilities indicated in Table 1 with the comparative model A being with criterion of comparison, the noise suppression effect of this invention can be obtained when the specific resistances are larger than 10 ohm cm and the relative permeabilities are more than 10. As can be seen in Fig.5 showing a comparison of noise suppression effects of various grain sizes of nickel zinc ferrite indicated as No.3 in Table 1, one of the necessary conditions for obtaining the effects of this invention is the grain sizes of the magnetic substance are larger than 10 m. FIG.8 is a graph showing the measurment of the noise suppresstion effect using the resistors with varied composition weight ratio of ferrite. Since too little binder will result in instability of the resistance value, not less than 20 wt binder is preferable. Conversely, when the binder is not less than 40 wtt and the ferrite is not less than 40 wtt, the noise suppression effect is reduced because the ferrite cannot be sealed with the binder and glass of 200 m in grain size. Fig.9 shows the composition of the carbon and binder, the ferrite and the glass in the resistor of the present invention. The spark plug of this invention is provided with a high frequency radio wave absorbing circuit for suppressing radio noises which comprises a resistor connected between a terminal metal member and a center electrode in series. A magnetic substance, of which grain sizes of the glass are large, carbon and binder are employed for the material of the resistor of the spark plug. As set forth in the detailed description of the embodiment, the spark pluy of this invention absorbs high frequency radio noises by means of a magnetic substance and the current path formed in a zigzag shape by glass, of which grain sizes are large, and the magnetic substance, and thereby inhibits radio noises. Thus, the radio noise suppression effect of the spark plug of this invention is greatly enhanced as compared with conventional spark plugs. Therefore, when the spark plug of this invention is employed in a high voltage ignition circuit of internal combustion engine, ill effects caused by radio noises for various electronic equipments mounted in a vehicle can be prevented. This invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit or essential characteristic thereof. The present embodiment is therefore to be considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive, the scope of the invention being indicated by the appended claim rather than by the foregoing description and all changes which come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claim are therefore intended to be embraced therein.
