# Method for manufacturing a multicolour filter and a multicolour display device.

## Abstract
A method of manufacturing a multicolour filter compris es the steps of forming electroconductive layers 7 electric ally insulated from one another on a substrate 6 and forming different coloured layers on different electroconduc tive layers by electro depositing a polymer 8 . The colouring material may either be deposited with the polymer or after the polymer has been deposited can be dyed.
