These derivatives are unsubstituted on the imino nitrogen of the guanidine moiety. In contrast, the compounds of the present invention differ by being a heterocyclic derivative of guanidine which carries a bulky substituent on the imino nitrogen of the guanidine moiety. Additional prior art, but further related, may be represented by German Offen. Nos. 2,321,330 and 2,502,397 U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,914,306, 3,933,836 and 4,073,636 and British Pat. No. 1,341,245.DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS This invention relates to new heterocyclic derivatives of guanidine having interesting pharmacological properties and, more particularly, to such derivatives having the formula EMI1.1 wherein Z is a member selected from the group consisting of EMI2.1 EMI2.2 wherein A is a member selected from the group consisting of O and S n is the integer zero or 1 R1 is a member selected from the group consisting of methyl and ethylR2 is a member selected from the group consisting of loweralkyl preferably methyl and ethyl , cycloalkyl having from 3 to 6 carbons preferably cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl and aralkyl preferably benzyl EMI3.1 taken together represents a member selected from the group consisting of EMI3.2 wherein W is a member selected from the group consisting of 0, S, N loweralkyl preferably N methyl and N aryl preferably N phenyl andR3 is a member selected from the group consisting of alkyl having from 4 to 10 carbons preferably branched , such as, for example, tert. butyl , neopentyl , I ,l ,3,3 tetramethylbutyl tert. octyl and the like phenyl methylenedioxyphenyl phenyl substituted with from 1 to 3 substituents each selected from the group consisting of halo, loweralkyl and loweralkoxy and phenyl substituted with a member selected from the group consisting of hydroxy, benzyloxy, nitro trifluoromethyl and methylthio naphthyl cycloalkyl having from 5 to 8 carbons preferably cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl bicycloalkyl having from 7 to 10 carbons, such as, for example, exo and endo 2 norbornyl, 2 bicyclo 2.2.2. octyl, endo 2 bicyclo 3.2.1. octyl and the like tricycloalkyl having from 9 to 10 carbons, such as, for example, nor adamantyl, 1 and 2 adamantyl, 1and 2 2,3,3a,4,5,6,7a octahydro 4,7 methanoindenyl and the like arylalkyl in which the aryl function is a member selected from the group consisting of phenyl and naphthyl and the alkyl function has from 1 to 4 carbons, such as, for example, benzyl, dl , d or l a phenethyl, dl, d or l Ai methylbenzyl, a,,a di methylbenzyl, a,a diemthyl ss phenethyl, dd, d or 1 o naphthyl ethyland the like and diphenylalkyl in which the alkyl function has from 1 to 2 carbons, such as, for example, diphenylmethyl, 1,2 and 2,2 diphenylethyl and the like.As used herein, the prefix lower indicates that the relevant group has I to 4 carbons and the term halo represents halogens of atomic weight less than 127, i.e., chloro, bromo, fluoro, and iodo.Due to the presence of the amine like nitrogen atoms in the compounds of formula I , acid addition salts thereof are readily obtained and such pharmaceutically acceptable salts are included within the scope of this invention. The subject compounds I may be converted to their therapeutically active nontoxic acid addition salt form by treatment with an appropriate acid, such as, for example, an inorganic acid, such as hydrohalic acid, e.g., hydrochloric, hydrobromic and the like, and sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid and the like, or an organic acid, such as, for example, acetic, propionic, glycolic, pamoic, pyruvic, malonic, succinic, maleic, fumaric, malic, tartaric, citric, benzoic, cinnamic, mandelic, niethanesulfonic, ethanesulfonic, benzenesulfonic, p toluenesulfonic, cyclohexanesulfamic, salicyclic, p aminosalicyclic and the like acids. Conversely, the salt form can be converted by treatment with alkali into the free base form.The subject compounds of formula I may be prepared from the starting materials of formula II , whereinZ1 Is the same as Z, but other than d or e , and in the case of f A is sulfur and n is zero. Said starting materials Z1H may be reacted with an isothiocyanate of formula III , wherein R3 is as previously described other than hydroxyphenyl, and in the instance wherein Z1 is f , R3 Is as previously described, but other than hydroxyphenyl and loweralkanoyloxyphenyl , in a reaction inert organic solvent, e.g., benzene, CH2C12, chlorofbrm and the like at temperatures ranging from about ambient to reflux temperatures, for about 2 to 24 hours, in approximately equimolar amounts.The thio function S in the thusobtained thioureas IV , is then transformed into an alkylthio function SR by reacting IV with an alkylating agent of the formula R X, wherein R is ethyl or, preferably, methyl, and X is halide, preferably iodide, tosylate, methosulfate, mesylate, fluorosulfonate and the like. Typical solvents for such alkylations include ethers, preferably diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, or dioxane, lower ketones, e.g., acetone, 2 butanone and the like halohydrocarbons and loweralkanols, preferably methylene dichloride and methanol, respectively. Methyl iodide as the alkylating agent in methanol is particularly suitable. Generally, equimolar to a large stoichio metric excess of the alkylating agent is used, the amount depending on the reactivity of the thiourea IV or its solubility in the solvent employed.The alkylation reaction may be carried out at temperatures ranging from ambient to reflux or in appropriate sealed vessels at higher temperatures. The alkylthio compounds of formula V in acid addition HX salt form are then reacted with an appropriate amine of the formula HNR1R2, wherein R1, R2 and NR1R2 are as previously described, preferably in a lower alkanol solvent such as isoprÏpanol and tert. butanol and generally at reflux temperatures of about 40 100oC., to yield the guanidine derivatives of formula I , in similar acid addition form, which are readily obtained as the corresponding base form by conventional treatment with suitable alkali.The foregoing reactions may be illustrated as follows EMI6.1 The isothiocyanates of formula III , many of which are known, may be prepared according to the extensive processes reported in the literature for making isothiocyanates. For example, they may be obtained from the methodologies reported by M. BBgemann et al. inMethoden der Organische Chemie Houben Weyl, EugenMiller Ed. , Georg Thieme Verlag Publ. Stuttgart,Germany, Vol. 9, page 867 884 1955 Preparation desIsothiocyanates Aromatiques by A. Rasschaert et al., Ind. Chim., Belge, 32, 106 1967 German Patent No. 1,300,559 J. Org. Chem., 36, 1549 1971 U.S. Pat.Nos. 2,395,455 and 3,304,167 French Pat. No.1,528,249 A New Synthesis of Aliphatic Isothiocyanates Angew. Chem. Internat. Ed., 6, 174 1967 Bull. Chem. Soc. Japan, 48, 2981 1975 Tetrahedron, 29, 691 1973 Chem. Ber., 101, 1746 1968 and J. IndianChem. Soc., 52, 148 1975 .In the foregoing reaction of V with the amine,HNR1R2, it is preferred to use a stoichiometric excess of the latter, for example, in 1 1.05 to 1 2.0 molar ratios. If only a slight excess of the HNR1R2 amine is used, it may be advantageous to add a stoichiometric equivalent of a tertiary alkyl amine, e.g., Et3N, in order to enhance the rate of reaction.Any by products which may be formed during the course of the reaction can be separated from the desired formula I product by standard techniques known in the art, such as, for example, by fractional solubiliza ti on. In each of the foregoing synthetic procedures for preparing formula I compounds wherein Z1 is f , hydroxyphenyl and loweralkanoyloxyphenyl were excluded from the original definition of R3. The formula I compounds wherein Z1 is f and whereinR3 is hydroxyphenyl may be prepared by hydrolysis of the corresponding R3 methoxyphenyl derivatives by conventional procedures, e.g., by treatment with HBr or HI and acetic acid.Acylation of the resultant R3 hydroxyphenyl derivatives by glacial acetic acid in the presence of excess dicyclohexylcarbodiimide affords the corresponding R3 loweralkanoyloxy derivatives of formula I Dand in which Z1 is fuzz The compounds of formula I , wherein R1, R2, NR1R2 and R3 other than hydroxyphenyl are as previously defined and Z is equal to the functions represented by letters b , d , e , and f , are alternatively prepared by reacting a pseudouronium salt of formula VI , or a lactam salt of formula XV or IXX whereinX is either methoxy or ethoxy and Yss is either 8 or e, with a guanidine derivative for formula VII , 2 with stoichiometric quantities of reactants being preferably employed.It is often advantageous to add four to eight molar equivalents of potassium carbonate to the reaction mixture following addition of the guanidine VII in order to cause the reaction to proceed toward completion. Suitable anhydrous organic solvents for conducting the reaction include lower aliphatic alcohols, such as, for example, methanol, ethanol, 2 propanol, tert. butanol and the like ethers, such as, for example, diethylether, tetrahydrofuran,.dioxane and the like and lower halogenated hydrocarbons such as, for example, chloroform, methylene chloride, l,2 dichloroethane and the like. Generally, methylene chloride is preferred for compound VI and tert. butanol for compounds XV or IXX . Ambient to 0 C. temperatures may generally be employed in the case of compounds VI , and ambient to reflux temperatures about 800C. are employed in the case of compounds XV or IXX . The products VIII , XVI or XX , in the form of the corresponding HY salt, is converted to the corresponding base form I by conventional means, for example, by treatment with a suitable alkali such as alkali metal or alkaline earth metal hydroxides carbonates and the like. The reactions may be illustrated as follows EMI8.1 EMI9.1 The pseudouronium fluoborates of formula VI , wherein Y is BF4 , may be obtained according to procedures described in the literature, e.g., see Canadian Patent Nos. 850,116 and 950,464 U.S. Pat.No. 3,876,658 Ber. 89, 2063 1956 and Org. Synth.46, 113, 120 1966 . The fluorosulfonates of formula VI b , or XXII b wherein Y is OSU2F8, are similarly prepared. In general, a cyclic urea of formula IX or a lactam of formula XVII a or XVII b or an oxo compound of formula XXI is reacted with an appropriate trialkyl oxonium fluoborate X or said compounds of formulae IX or XXI is reacted with methyl fluorosulfonate XI to give the corresponding salt V or XXII . The reaction is preferably carried out from 0 0C. to ambient temperature under an inert dry atmosphere e.g., nitrogen, argon in an inert anhydrous lower halohydrocarbon solvent such as, for example, chloroform, 1,2 dichloroethane, methylene dichloride most preferred and the like.Other inert anhydrous organic solvents that may be employed include ethers such as, for example, diethyl ether, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran THF , 1,2 dimethoxyethane and the like.The foregoing reactions may be illustrated as follows EMI10.1 EMI11.1 In the foregoing synthetic procedures for preparing formula I compounds wherein Z is d or e , hydroxyphenyl and loweralkanoyloxyphenyl were excluded from the original definition of R3. The formula I compounds wherein R3 is hydroxyphenyl may be prepared by hydrolysis of either the corresponding R3 methoxy phenyl or benzyloxyphenyl derivatives by conventional procedures, e.g., by treatment with HBr or HI in acetic acid. Acylation of the resultant R3 hydroxyphenyl derivatives by lower alkanoic acids in the presence of excess dicyclohexylcarbodiimide affords the corresponding R3. loweralkanoyloxy derivatives of formula I .Another method of preparing the formula I compounds wherein Z is a , b or c , Z in such case being designated Z2 utilizes the methodology described by E. Kuhle, Angew. Chem. Internat. Ed., 8, 24, 26, 1969 and references cited therein, which involves the sequential displacement of chloride from an appropriate isocyanide dichloride XII wherein R3 is other than hydroxyphenyl. The latter, the preparation of which is described by E. Kuhle et al. in Angew.Chem. Internat. Ed., 6, 649 1967 , is reacted with the amine, HNR1R2, in the presence of a trialkylamine, e.g., triethylamine, in a suitable reaction inert aprotic anhydrous solvent such as an ether, for example, diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran and the like, a halohydrocarbon, an aromatic hydrocarbon, and the like, to give the monochloride compound XIII which is separated from triethylamine hydrochloride, by filtration, and then used in situ as the filtrate in the reaction with Z2H II to form final product I .EMI12.1 Preferably, two molar equivalents of Z2H II are then reacted with each molar equivalent of XIII .Alternatively, when Z2 is equal to the diaza function represented by letter c , a 1 1 molar equivalent ratio of reactants may be employed in which case a molar equivalent of an appropriate halogen acid scavenger, for example, a base such as triethylamine, is added to pick up the hydrochloric acid released during the course of the reaction. In either route, the resultant precipitated acid addition salt is removed from the reaction mixture, e.g., by filtration, and the desired product I which remains in situ in the filtrate, is conveniently isolated by conversion to an acid addition salt in the conventional manner.EMI13.1 Still another method of preparing the formula I compounds utilizes the methodology of H.G. Viehe and Z. Janousekt Angew. Chem. internat. Ed., 12 10 , 806 1973 , from the interaction of an appropriate dichloromethyleneammoniun salt of formula XTV with an equivalent amount of an appropriate amine of formula rev wherein R3 is other than hydroxyphenyl, in the presence of at least two equiva lents of an appropriate acid scavenger, e.g., triethylamine, to yield the aforementioned product XIII which may then be reacted with ZE II to form end products I as previously described. EMI14.1 In each of the foregoing synthetic procedures for preparing formula I compounds wherein Z is a , b or c , Z in such case being designated Z2 hydroxyphenyl was excluded from the original definition of R3. The formula I compounds whereinR3 is hydroxyphenyl may be prepared either i by debenzylation of the corresponding R3 benzyloxyphenyl derivatives by conventional procedures, e.g., by reduction via hydrogenation in the presence of palladium on carbon catalyst or ii by hydrolysis of the corresponding R3 benzyloxyphenyl and methoxyphenyl derivatives by conventional procedures,e.g., by treatment with HBr or HI in acetic acid. This latter procedure is preferred when sulfur is present in the molecule, e.g., wherein NR1R2 EMI14.2 thiamorpholine .It is known that sulfur, when present in organic molecules in the divalent state, has a poisoning effect on hydrogenation catalysts, e.g., palladium oncharcoal. . Therefore, it is preferred that compounds of formula I wherein NR1R2 thiamorpholine and R3 hydroxyphenyl, be prepared by hydrolysis of either a corresponding R3 methoxy Ph or R3 benzyloxy Ph derivatives of formula I by the action of eitherHBr or HI in acetic acid. The subject compounds of formula I and the acid addition salts thereof possess valuable pharmacological properties, particularly as hypoglycemic agents. Their ability to lower blood sugar is demonstrated in the following rat glucose tolerance test, which test is a standard and extremely sensitive procedure used in the diagnosis of diabetes and hypoglycemic disease states.In this test, male Sprague Dawley rats Charles River 184 250 grams are given water ad libitum and fasted 24 hours prior to the experiment. Two to five rats are used for each test and control group. Test compounds, 1 200 mg kg are admEnistered s.c., i.p.or orally suspended in 0.5 to 1.0 milliliter, but preferably the former, of 0.5 1.0 methylcellulose vehicle. Control animals are given an equal amount of vehicle. Serial blood samples 0.1 milliliter are obtained from the tail without anesthesia prior to and at 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 minutes after administration of 0.8 to 1.0 gram of glucose per kilogram of body weight in 1 milliliter of water. The glucose is given orally if the test compound has been given karenterally, and subcutaneously if the test compound has been given orally. Specimens of blood are immediately deproteinized with aqueous solutions of Ba OH 2 and ZnSO4 and glucose levels are determined using the glucose oxidase assay described by L. P.Cawley et al., Ultra Micro Chemical Analysis ofBlood Glucose with Glucose Oxidase, Amer. J. Coin.Path., 32, 195 1959 . The blood glucose values at each time point are expressed in terms of milligram percent mg glucose 100 ml of blood . The mean glucose values of the controls are compared statistically by the Student s t Test to the means of the experimental group at each of the corresponding time points. If the compound lowers the blood glucose significantly at any time at a 95 confidence limit, the compound is considered to have hypoglycemic activity. The blood glucose lowering, expressed as percent lowering, is obtained by dividing the difference between the mean blood glucose values for test and control animals by the mean glucose value for the control animal. In addition to their hypoglycemic activity, certain of the subject compounds have been found to possess antisecretory activity and or cardiovascular activity as demonstrated in tests described in my copending patent application Serial No. 828,561, filed August 29,1977, and entitled Heterocyclic Derivatives of Guanidine, and corresponding to South African Patent No. 1644 granted February 7, 1979 The subject compounds I , in base or salt form, may be formulated into conventional liquid and solid pharmaceutical dosage forms and preparations, for example, for oral or parenteral administration, according to standard pharmaceutical techniques in the art.
