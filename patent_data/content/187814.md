## Description
The present invention relates to a biochemical reagent system including a receptor and an indicating means that recognizes and selectively binds to plasminogen activator inhibitors, and more particularly relates to biochemical reagent and diagnostic systems for the detection and quantitation of plasminogen activator inhibitors in blood and other biological samples. Endothelial cells line the luminal surface of the vascular bed and are thought to play an active role in the specific proteolytic breakdown of locally deposited fibrin, Todd, Although these inhibitors probably serve important regulatory roles in controlling the fibrinolytic system of the vascular wall, little is known about their specificity, mode of action, or biochemical nature. The conclusion that these inhibitors are actually synthesized by endothelial cells is obscured somewhat by recent reports that cultured cells may bind and internalize protease inhibitors from serum containing culture medium, Cohen, The possibility of producing unlimited amounts of tissue type plasminogen activator t PA by recombinant DNA technology has generated much interest, both clinically and commercially. The conversion of the relatively inactive molecule into an extremely efficient thrombolytic agent by fibrin itself, suggests that t PA may exist as an active enzyme only when localized to the fibrin platelet thrombus itself. Thus, t PA is considered to be a much more specific thrombolytic agent than urokinase type plasminogen activator and streptokinase. The interactions between t PA and fibrin have raised the argument that natural inhibitors of t PA are not necessary to regulate this system i.e., regulation is achieved through the formation dissolution of fibrin, and, thus, do not exist. It is clear that the existence of such inhibitors in human blood would complicate attempts to design a specific, efficient, and safe thrombolytic program based upon genetically engineered t PA. At the very least, calculations such as those of dose, treatment time and efficacy of treatment would be difficult to predict and or monitor. This problem would be especially acute if inhibitor levels varied from individual to individual. The existence of specific inhibitors of t PA in plasma is a matter of some dispute, Collen, That conclusion has recently been challenged in Kruithof et al., Recently, an antifibrinolytic agent in cultured endothelial cells was detested, Loskutoff et al., The inhibitor found by Loskutoff et al., The present invention contemplates a biochemical reagent system and methods of preparing and using same, as well as diagnostics utilizing the reagent system. The biochemical reagent system comprises a a receptor such as an antibody raised in an animal host to a plasminogen activator inhibitor i.e., an anti plasminogen activator, and b an indicating means. In one aspect of the invention, the biochemical reagent system is comprised of a an indicating means and b a receptor that may be a polyclonal antibody raised in an animal host. The indicating means and receptor may be a single molecule or may be composed of a plurality of individual molecules. The receptor binds to a specific plasminogen activator inhibitor that itself binds to and inhibits tissue type or urokinase type plasminogen activator. The indicating means labels the receptor, and in so doing indicates the presence of the inhibitor in a sample to be assayed such as serum of patients having thrombotic disease. The receptor of the reagent system of the present invention selectively binds to inhibitor bound to tissue type t PA and urokinase type u PA plasminogen activators. In a further aspect of the present invention a solid phase assay method of detecting the presence and quantity of plasminogen activator inhibitor in a sample to be assayed is contemplated. The method comprises the steps of a providing a solid matrix on which to assay said sample b affixing on said solid matrix a binding reagent that binds to complexes with said inhibitor to form a solid phase support, said binding reagent being a plasminogen activator selected from the group consisting of t PA and u PA or the above described polyclonal receptor c admixing an aliquot of a liquid sample to be assayed with the solid phase support to form a solid liquid phase admixture d maintaining the admixture for a predetermined time sufficient for the binding reagent to bind to complex with inhibitor present in the sample e separating the solid and liquid phases f admixing an aqueous liquid solution of second binding reagent that binds to the inhibitor bound on the solid support with the solid phase obtained after step e above to form a second solid liquid phase admixture, the second binding reagent comprising the other of a plasminogen activator selected from tissue type plasminogen activator and urokinase type plasminogen activator or a polyclonal receptor that was not used in step b g maintaining the second solid liquid admixture for a predetermined time sufficient for the second binding reagent to bind form a complex with the inhibitor typically about 2 to about 4 hours h separating the solid and liquid phases of the second solid liquid phase admixture and i determining the quantity of the second binding reagent that bound to the inhibitor, and thereby determining the quantity of inhibitor. The present invention further includes a mammalian diagnostic system such as a kit. The kit includes at least one package containing as an active ingredient a biochemical reagent system and t PA or u PA. The biochemical reagent system comprises a polyclonal receptor in dry, solution, or dispersion form, that, when admixed with an indicating means and a sample to be assayed, binds selectively to t PA inhibitor present in the sample and indicates the presence and amount of the inhibitor. Indicating groups that may be contained in the system include a radioactive element, a biologically active enzyme, or an NMR active element. The diagnostic system may also include a solid matrix that may be a microtiter strip such as that containing twelve wells in a row. The t PA or u PA present is preferably bound to the solid matrix. The diagnostic system may further include a standard against which to compare the assay results, as well as various buffers in dry or liquid form, for, The use of a biochemical reagent system of this invention includes the detection and quantitation of a specific plasminogen activator inhibitor that is bound to complexed with a plasminogen activator such as tissue type or urokinase type plasminogen activator. An especially preferred use of such a reagent system relates to the detection of plasminogen activator inhibitor in an The present invention provides several benefits and advantages. One benefit of the present invention is that the biochemical reagent system and diagnostic system of the invention are highly specific. Biological samples frequently contain numerous fibrinolytic inhibitors. It is difficult to distinguish among them by existing assays since those assays, in general, measure the capacity of a sample to decrease the activity of plasminogen activators or plasmin. In contrast, the particularly preferred diagnostic system of the present invention detects only inhibitor bound to particular plasminogen activators. Another benefit of the present invention is that the reagent system of the invention is quantitative, providing a measure of the quantity of functionally active inhibitor bound to PAs, and not inhibitor activity. Therefore, the reagent system may not be as influenced by changes in salt or pH, for example, as are enzymatic assays. One of the advantages of the present invention is that the diagnostic system of the invention may employ tissue type plasminogen activator t PA or urokinase type plasminogen activator u PA bound to wells of microtiter plates, and thus readily lends itself to screening large numbers of samples in a rapid and reproducible manner. Another advantage of the present invention is that the biochemical reagent system and diagnostic system of the invention measure only functionally active inhibitor i.e., inhibitor that binds to t PA or u PA. It is this form that is likely to change in various diseases. The inhibitor, as released by endothelial cells and platelets, exists in two forms, one active, and one inactive. The inactive form can be activated by treatment with denaturants, such as SDS and guanidine. Thus, an added advantage of the reagent and diagnostic systems of the present invention is that they can be used to measure the relative amount of both active and inactive inhibitor in various samples. Other advantages and benefits of the present invention will become readily apparent to those skilled in the art from the following description of the invention, the drawings and the appended claims. In the drawings forming a portion of the disclosure of this invention The present invention is directed to a biochemical reagent system and to methods of preparing and using same, as well as to diagnostics utilizing the reagent system. The reagent system comprises a a receptor raised in an animal host to a plasminogen activator inhibitor, and b an indicating means. The term plasminogen activator inhibitor as used herein is meant to indicate a protein that inhibits or checks the action of a plasminogen activator. Plasminogen activator is a protein that activates plasminogen present in blood, particularly in plasma, and converts it into plasmin in the fibrinolytic system of blood clotting. Plasminogen activators useful in the present invention include tissue type plasminogen activator t PA and urokinase type plasminogen activator u PA . As used herein, urokinase type is meant to indicate urokinase and its homologous proteins as found in mammals other than humans. The term receptor as used herein is meant to indicate a biologically active molecule that binds to an antigen ligand. A receptor molecule of the present invention is an antibody, a substantially intact antibody in substantially purified form, such as is found in ascites fluid or serum of an immunized animal, or an idiotype containing polypeptide portion of an antibody such as Fab and F ab ‚ÇÇ antibody portions as are described hereinafter. Biological activity of a receptor molecule is evidenced by the binding of the receptor to its antigenic ligand upon their admixture in an aqueous medium, at least at physiological pH values and ionic strengths. Preferably, the receptors also bind to the antigenic ligand within a pH value range of about 5 to about 9, and at ionic strengths such as that of distilled water to that of about one molar sodium chloride. Idiotype containing polypeptide portions antibody combining sites of antibodies are those portions of antibody molecules that include the idiotype and bind to the ligand, and include the Fab, Fab and F ab ‚ÇÇ portions of the antibodies. Fab and F ab ‚ÇÇ portions of antibodies are well known in the art, and are prepared by the reaction of papain and pepsin, respectively, on substantially intact antibodies by methods that are well known. See for example, U. S. Patent No. 4,342,566 to Theofilopolous and Dixon. Fab portions of antibodies are also well known and are prepared by the reduction of F ab ‚ÇÇ disulfide bonds as by mercaptoethanol followed by alkylation of the reduced cysteine residues with a reagent such as iodoacetamide. Intact antibodies are preferred receptors, and will be utilized as illustrative of the receptor molecules of this invention. The receptors useful in the present invention are polyclonal receptors. A polyclonal receptor Pab is a receptor produced by clones of different antibody producing cells that produce antibodies to a plurality of epitopes of the immunizing molecule. Non human, warm blooded animals usable in the present invention as hosts in which the polyclonal receptors are raised can include poultry such as a chicken or a pigeon , a member of the ratitae bird group such as an emu, ostrich, cassowary or moa or a mammal such as a dog, cat, monkey, goat, pig, cow, horse, rabbit, guinea pig, rat, hamster or mouse . Preferably, the host animal is a rabbit. Receptors are utilized along with an indicator labelling means or indicating group or a label . The indicating group or label is utilized in conjunction with the receptor as a means for determining that a specific inhibitor has bound to the receptor. The terms indicator labelling means , indicating group or label are used herein to include single atoms and molecules that are linked to the receptor or used separately, and whether those atoms or molecules are used alone or in conjunction with additional reagents. Such indicating groups or labels are themselves well known in immunochemistry and constitute a part of this invention only insofar as they are utilized with otherwise novel receptors, methods and or systems. The indicator labelling means can be a fluorescent labelling agent that chemically binds to antibodies or antigens without denaturing them to form a fluorochrome dye that is a useful immunofluorescent tracer. Suitable fluorescent labelling agents are fluorochromes such as fluorescein isocyanate FIC , flourescein isothiocyanate FITC , dimethylaminonaphthalene S sulphonyl chloride DANSC , tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate TRITC , lissamine rhodamine B200 sulphonyl chloride RB 200 SC and the like. A description of immunofluorescence analysis techniques is found in Marchalonis et al., Immunofluorescence Analysis , 189 231, which is incorporated herein by reference. The indicator labelling means can be linked directly to a receptor of this invention, to a useful antigen such as t PA or u PA, or may comprise a separate molecule. It is particularly preferred that the indicator means be a separate molecule such as antibodies that bind to a receptor of this invention. The indicating group may also be a biologically active enzyme, such as horseradish peroxidase HRP or glucose oxidase, or the like. Where the principal indicating group is an enzyme such as HRP or glucose oxidase, additional reagents are required to visualize the fact that a receptor ligand complex has formed. Such additional reagents for HRP include hydrogen peroxide and an oxidation dye precursor such as diaminobenzidine. An additional reagent useful with glucose oxidase is 2,2 azino di 3 ethylbenzthiazoline 6 sulfonic acid ABTS . Radioactive elements provide another class of label, and are used herein as exemplary of useful labels. An exemplary radiolabelling agent that may be utilized in the invention is a radioactive element that produces gamma ray emissions. Elements which themselves emit gamma rays, such ¬π¬≤‚Å¥I, ¬π¬≤‚ÅµI, ¬π¬≤‚Å∏I, ¬π¬≥¬πI, ¬π¬≥¬≤I, and ‚Åµ¬πCr represent one class of gamma ray emission producing radioactive element indicating groups. Particularly preferred is ¬π¬≤‚ÅµI. Another class of useful indicating groups are those elements such as ¬π¬πC, ¬π‚Å∏F, ¬π‚ÅµO, and ¬π¬≥N that themselves emit positrons. The positrons so emitted produce gamma rays upon encounters with electrons present in the analysis medium. Also useful is a beta ray emitter, such as ¬π¬π¬πindium. A radioactive polyclonal receptor can be made by culturing in a medium containing radioactive amino acids, as is well known, as well as by isolating the polyclonal receptor and then labelling the polyclonal receptor with one of the above radioactive elements. Radiolabeling of proteins is well known in the art and will not be discussed further herein. The method of forming a polyclonal receptor for use in a biochemical reagent system of the present invention comprises administering to an animal host, preferably a mammal e.g., a rabbit, goat or horse a plasminogen activator inhibitor in an amount sufficient to induce the production of antibodies to the inhibitor. The resulting antibodies are a receptor for the inhibitor. Antisera containing the antibodies are then collected from the immunized host and the receptor so produced is recovered. A biochemical reagent system is formed by combining the receptor formed as described above with an indicating means. Suitable indicating means are those previously described hereinbefore. It is particularly preferred that the indicating means be a separate molecule. An embodiment of the invention is a solid phase assay method for detecting the presence and quantity of plasminogen activator inhibitor in a sample to be assayed. The method comprises the steps of a providing a solid matrix on which to assay a sample b affixing on the solid matrix a binding reagent that binds complexes with to the inhibitor to form a solid phase support c admixing an aliquot of a liquid sample to be assayed with the solid phase support to form a solid liquid phase admixture d maintaining the admixture for a predetermined time typically about 2 to 4 hours sufficient for the binding reagent to bind to complex with inhibitor present in the sample e separating the solid and liquid phases and f admixing an aqueous liquid solution of second binding reagent that binds to the inhibitor bound on the solid support with the solid phase obtained after step e to form a second solid liquid phase admixture, the second binding reagent comprising the other of a plasminogen activator selected from tissue type plasminogen activator and urokinase type plasminogen activator or a polyclonal receptor that was not used in step b g maintaining the second solid liquid admixture for a predetermined time sufficient for the second binding reagent to bind form a complex with the inhibitor typically about 2 to about 4 hours h separating the solid and liquid phases of the second solid liquid phase admixture and i determining the quantity of the second binding reagent that bound to the inhibitor, and thereby determining the quantity of inhibitor. The amount of second binding agent that binds to or complexes with the inhibitor is typically determined by an indicating means, as described hereinbefore. The indicating means may linked to the second binding reagent so that the second binding agent and indicating means are one molecule. More preferably, the second binding reagent and indicating means are separate molecules. Thus, where the indicating means is linked to the second binding reagent, the above method for determining the presence of inhibitor complexed with the first named binding reagent may be carried out using the steps of i admixing an aqueous, liquid solution of second binding reagent containing a linked indicating means with the solid phase obtained after step e above to form a second solid liquid phase admixture, the second binding reagent binding to complexing with the inhibitor, and the indicating means providing a means of determining the quantity of the second binding reagent that bound to the inhibitor ii maintaining the admixtures for a predetermined time sufficient for the second binding reagent to bind to complex with the inhibitor iii separating the solid and liquid phases of the second solid liquid phase admixture and iv determining the quantity of second binding reagent that bound to the inhibitor. The indicating means is a separate molecule in particularly preferred practice. In such situations, the bound complexed inhibitor may be determined by the steps of i admixing a liquid solution of second binding reagent with the solid phase obtained after step e above to form a second solid liquid phase admixture, the second binding reagent binding to complexing with the inhibitor ii maintaining the admixture so formed for a predetermined period of time sufficient for the second binding reagent to bind to complex with the inhibitor iii separating the solid and liquid phases of the second solid liquid phase admixture iv admixing a separate molecule indicator labelling means as discussed hereinbefore to form a third solid liquid phase admixture v maintaining the third solid liquid phase admixture for a predetermined period of time sufficient for the second binding reagent and indicator labelling means to bind typically about 2 to about 4 hours vi separating the solid and liquid phases of the third solid liquid phase admixture and vii determining the amount of separate molecule indicator labelling means that bound to the second binding reagent. Details for the above embodiment are given hereinafter wherein the first binding reagent is t PA or u PA, the second binding reagent is rabbit anti inhibitor antibody and the separate molecule indicator means is a goat anti rabbit IgG antibody. In yet another method, the amount of inhibitor reacted or complexed with the first binding reagent may be determined without the use of a second binding reagent. In this embodiment, the indicator labelling means is linked directly to the inhibitor, and the amount of inhibitor is determined by that label. For example, the proteins present in a sample to be assayed may be radiolabelled with 125 iodine following one of the procedures described hereinafter. After separation of the solid and liquid phases of step e , hereinbefore, the radiolabelled, but unbound, proteins are removed from the admixture thereby leaving radiolabelled, bound inhibitor on the solid support. The presence and amount of that bound, radiolabelled inhibitor can then be determined using a gamma counter. A similar result can be obtained using a reactive fluorescent molecule as the indicator labelling means such as fluoroscein isocyanate to react with the components of the assayed sample in place of the radioactive element. Preferred first and second binding reagents include tissue type and urokinase type plasminogen activators or the above described receptor of the invention. If the first binding reagent utilized is tissue type or urokinase type plasminogen activator, then the second binding reagent is the receptor. Alternatively, if the first binding reagent utilized is the receptor, then the second binding reagent is one of the above plasminogen activators. Thus, the first binding reagent is a a plasminogen activator selected from the group consisting of t PA and u PA, or b a receptor of this invention that binds to the inhibitor, and the second binding reagent is a a plasminogen activator selected from the group consisting of t PA and u PA, or b a receptor of this invention. However, the first and second binding reagents are different. The separate molecule indicator labelling means is preferably used where the second binding reagent is an intact or substantially intact antibody receptor of this invention that binds to the inhibitor. As such, the separate molecule indicator labelling means is preferably an antibody such as goat anti rabbit IgG or protein A having a linked indicating group such as a radioisotope, enzyme or fluorochrome dye. The present invention further contemplates a diagnostic system, that may be in the form of a kit, for detecting the presence and quantity of a plasminogen activator inhibitor in a sample. The kit includes at least one package containing 1 as an active ingredient, an effective amount of the biochemical reagent system of the invention in dry, solution, or dispersion form, and 2 t PA or u PA. The diagnostic system may also include a solid matrix that may be a microtiter strip or plate having a plurality of wells. The t PA or urokinase present is preferably bound to the solid matrix. Suitable solid matrices useful in the diagnostic system and method described hereinbefore include 96 well microtiter plates sold under the Trade Mark Falcon Microtest III Flexible Assay Plates Falcon Plastics, Oxnard, CA and microtiter strips sold under the Trade Marks Immulon I and II Dynatech, Alexandria, VA . The microtiter strip or plate is made of a clear plastic material, preferably polyvinyl chloride or polystyrene. Alternative solid matrices for use in the diagnostic system include polystyrene beads, about 1 micron to about 5 millimeters in diameter, available from Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL polystyrene tubes, sticks or paddles of any convenient size and polystyrene latex whose polystyrene particles are of a size of about 1 micron and can be centrifugally separated from the latex. The solid matrix may also be made of a variety of materials such as cross linked dextran, e.g. Sephadex G 25, 50, 100, 200 Trade Marks and the like available from Pharmacia Fine Chemicals of Piscataway, New Jersey, agarose and cross linked agarose, e.g. Sepharose 6B, CL6B, 4B, CL4B Trade Marks and the like also available from Pharmacia Fine Chemicals. The agarose or Sepharose matrices are typically activated for linking using cyanogen bromide. The activated matrix is then washed with one molar glycine and linked to the biochemical reagent system of the invention, t PA or u PA without drying of the activated matrix solid support . The matrix linked reagent system, t PA or u PA is then washed and is ready for use. Further details of use of these solid matrices are provided in Section III, B. The diagnostic may further include a standard against which to compare the assay results and various buffers in dry or liquid form. An indicating means such as those described hereinbefore is preferably supplied along with the receptor in the biochemical reagent system and may be packaged therewith when linked to the receptor or more preferably is packaged separately when a separate molecule indicating means is used. Additional reagents such as hydrogen peroxide and diaminobenzidine may also be included in the system when an indicating group such as HRP is utilized. Such materials are readily available in commerce, as are many indicating groups, and may not be supplied along with the diagnostic system. In addition, some reagents such as hydrogen peroxide decompose on standing, or are otherwise short lived like some radioactive elements, and are better supplied by the end user. The data from several studies, discussed hereinafter, were performed to assess the nature of the plasminogen activator inhibitor and the ability of the biochemical reagent diagnostic systems of the present invention to detect and quantify plasminogen activator inhibitor bound to plasminogen activator in human serum. The diagnostic system of the invention is based upon the ability of the inhibitor to bind to t PA or u PA immobilized on plastic microtiter wells. After washing, the extent of binding was quantified by admixing and maintaining incubating the complex first with rabbit antiserum to the inhibitor and then with ¬π¬≤‚ÅµI goat anti rabbit IgG. Using the diagnostic system and assay method of the present invention, it was found that the reaction between t PA and the inhibitor was rapid greater than 78 percent binding within 1 hour , time and concentration dependent, and sensitive over a broad range of inhibitor concentrations 1 100 ng ml . Exogenously added t PA and u PA were found to compete with the immobilized t PA for the inhibitor with a 50 percent reduction in binding obtained with 12 ng ml of t PA and 6 ng ml of u PA. It is to be understood that the results discussed hereinbelow are illustrative of embodiments utilizing the biochemical reagent and diagnostic systems of the present invention and the present invention is not intended to be so limited. It had previously been shown that CM as described in Section III A, B, hereinafter, and in the following papers from BAEs contained both tissue type t PA and urokinase type u PA plasminogen activators, Levin et al., One liter of CM was applied to a concanavalin A Sepharose column and the column was processed as described in Section III hereinafter. The peak fractions were pooled, fractionated by SDS PAGE, and analyzed for protein by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and for the presence of fibrinolytic activators and inhibitors by reverse fibrin autography. As shown in FIGURE 1, more than 85 percent of the protein applied to the column was recovered in the run through effluent pool I . This fraction contained both albumin and u PA, but no inhibitor not shown . Some inhibitor was detected in Pool III, the fraction containing the majority of recovered t PA activity, Loskutoff et al., The concanavalin A pool II also was analyzed by SDS PAGE in tube gels and results are shown in FIGURE 2. After electrophoresis, the gel was sliced and extracts of the slices tested for their ability to inhibit in PA mediated lysis of ¬π¬≤‚ÅµI fibrin. Again, inhibitor activity was detected in a single region of the gel, and migrated with a relative mobility R The extracts with the highest inhibitor activity FIGURE 2, slices 49 52 were pooled and reanalyzed on 7.5 20 percent gradient gels and the results shown in FIGURE 3. A single protein was detected when the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue FIGURE 3, lane 1 or periodic acid Schiff reagent FIGURE 3, lane 2 , and it comigrated with the inhibitor as revealed by reverse fibrin autography FIGURE 3, lane 3 . The amount of inhibitor antigen present in the starting CM and in the various pooled fractions was determined by the rocket technique of Laurell, These screenings indicated that CM contained 0.6 micrograms ml of inhibitor, that 600 micrograms of inhibitor were applied to the concanavalin A column FIGURE 1 , and that 90 microgams were recovered from the final gel extracts FIGURES 2 and 3 . Thus, this purification protocol yielded a recovery of approximately 15 percent of the starting antigen. The purified inhibitor had an apparent molecular weight M PAs convert single chain plasminogen into two chain plasmin by cleavage of a single arginine valine bond, Summaria et al., The inhibitor activity of the purified molecule, like that detected in CM collected from confluent BAEs, Loskutoff et al., Both plasma and serum contain inhibitors of fibrinolysis, Loskutoff, Immunoprecipitation screenings were performed both to confirm the above results and to quantitate inhibitor synthesis by cloned BAEs. The results are shown in FIGURE 9 and in Table I below. In these screenings, radiolabeled CM collected from cloned BAEs was incubated with antibody to the purified inhibitor. The bound material was extracted from the antibody protein A Sepharose beads, fractionated by SDS PAGE, and analyzed by autoradiography FIGURE 9 . A single radiolabeled polypeptide of an approximate M Polyvinyl chloride PVC plastic wells were coated overnight at 4 C with varying concentrations of t PA to determine the optimal concentrations of t PA for the assay of the present invention as shown in FIGURE 10. The wells were washed, blocked with BSA and incubated for 2 hours at 37 C with three different concentrations of purified inhibitor 20, 50 and 100 ng ml . After washing, the extent of binding was quantified by incubating the complex first with rabbit anti inhibitor receptor diluted 1 100 followed by ¬π¬≤‚ÅµI goat anti rabbit IgG 1.5 x 10‚Åµ cpm well . As the t PA concentration used to coat the PVC wells was increased from 0.1 to 1.0 microgram ml, the detection of bound inhibitor increased at all three concentrations FIGURE 10 . Increasing the t PA coating concentration above 1 microgram ml did not increase the detection of bound inhibitor. Thus, subsequent screenings employed a t PA concentration of 1 microgram ml for coating the PVC wells. The kinetics of the interaction of the inhibitor with immobilized t PA were determined in order to optimize the incubation period for inhibitor containing solutions. Purified inhibitor 100 ng ml was incubated at 37 C for various times on either t PA or BSA coated wells. The bound inhibitor was then quantified with the rabbit anti inhibitor receptor 1 100 followed by ¬π¬≤‚ÅµI goat anti rabbit IgG 1.5 x 10‚Åµ cpm well . The reaction between the inhibitor and immobilized t PA was a fast reaction with over 75 percent binding occurring within 30 minutes FIGURE 11 . During this period, the inhibitor did not bind to control, BSA coated wells. For convenience, a 1 hour incubation time for inhibitor containing solutions was used in subsequent screenings. The incubation time for the polyclonal receptor and indicating means were similarly optimized. t PA or BSA coated wells were incubated for 1 hour at 37 C with the inhibitor 50 ng ml and then incubated with the rabbit anti inhibitor receptor for various periods of time. Bound receptor was detected by a 2 hour incubation with the indicator ¬π¬≤‚ÅµI goat anti rabbit IgG . Alternatively, the wells were incubated for 2 hours with the receptor and the incubation time for the indicator was varied. Both the receptor and indicator associated rapidly with their respective antigen in the assay with over 80 percent binding occurring after 1.5 2 hours FIGURE 12 . Therefore, subsequent screenings employed a 2 hour incubation period for both the receptor and indicator. The effect of varying dilutions of rabbit anti inhibitor receptor on the detection of inhibitor was determined to optimize the assay s sensitivity. t PA coated wells were incubated for 1 hour at 37 C with various concentrations of inhibitor 1 100 ng ml . After washing, the wells were incubated with various dilutions of rabbit anti inhibitor receptor 1 50 1 500 and the bound antibody was detected with ¬π¬≤‚ÅµI goat anti rabbit IgG 1.5 x 10‚Åµ cpm ml . Optimal detection of inhibitor occurred at a 1 50 1 75 dilution of the antisera FIGURE 13 . Subsequent screenings employed a 1 75 dilution of the antisera. The effect of varying concentrations of ¬π¬≤‚ÅµI goat anti rabbit IgG 2.5 x 10‚Å¥ 3 x 10‚Åµ cpm well was similarly screened to optimize the assays s sensitivity. Optimal detection of inhibitor occurred at 2.5 5 x 10‚Å¥ cpm well of ¬π¬≤‚ÅµI goat anti rabbit IgG FIGURE 14 . A typical standard dose response curve of purified inhibitor as detected in this assay is shown in FIGURE 15. The assay was sensitive to 1 ng ml, demonstrated a linear response to inhibitor between 10 and 100 ng ml and saturated at inhibitor concentrations above 250 ng ml. A dose response using bovine aortic endothelial cell conditioned media CM is also shown in FIGURE 15. Comparison of this curve with the standard curve indicates that this CM sample contained approximately 100 ng ml of functionally active inhibitor. For convenience, the standard curve was routinely plotted on a log vs. log plot for the purpose of calculating inhibitor concentrations in unknown samples FIGURE 16 . It can be seen that plotting in this way gave a straight line. The sensitivity of the functional assay inhibitor binding assay of the present invention was compared with the sensitivity of another assay, reverse fibrin autography, commonly used for the detection and quantitation of PA inhibitor. Various concentrations of inhibitor 0.5 ng 10 ng lane were fractionated by SDS PAGE and then analyzed by reverse fibrin autography. The results are shown in FIGURE 17. In this technique, the washed polyacrylamide gel was layed on an indicator gel containing fibrin, plasminogen and a PA. Plasmin was slowly formed, resulting in the general lysis of the gel except in areas where inhibitors were present in the corresponding polyacrylamide gel. The sensitivity of reverse fibrin autography was 2.5 ng lane FIGURE 17 and since 0.1 ml was applied to each lane, its sensitivity was 25 ng ml, or 25 times less sensitive than the inhibitor binding assay. The inhibitor binding assay of the present invention was used to study the interaction of purified enzymes with the inhibitor. Three purified PAs t PA, u PA and streptokinase were preincubated for 1 hour at 37 C with the purified inhibitor 50 ng ml and the ability of the inhibitor to subsequently bind to t PA was quantitated in the inhibitor binding assay. Exogenously added t PA and u PA were found to compete with the immobilized t PA for binding to the inhibitor, with a 50 percent reduction in binding obtained at 12 ng ml of t PA and 6 ng ml of u PA, as shown in FIGURE 18. Neither streptokinase, nor DFP inactivated t PA data not shown affected the binding of the inhibitor to immobilized t PA. The inhibitor binding assay of the invention was also used to detect inhibitor in human plasma and serum. Plasma and serum were prepared from blood collected from 16 healthy human donors and the inhibitor activity in each sample measured in the inhibitor binding assay. Normal human plasma contained low or undetectable levels of inhibitor, as shown in FIGURE 19. In contrast, serum from these donors contained high levels of inhibitor activity, as also shown in FIGURE 19. Finally, the assay was employed to determine and compare inhibitor levels in plasma from normal donors and donors with suspected abnormalities in their hemostatic system. The results are shown below in Table II. Tissue type plasminogen activator t PA was isolated from human melanoma cell conditioned media as described in Rijken et al., Commercially available urokinase 5x10‚Åµ CTA units of WINKINASE, Sterling Winthrop, Rensselaer, NY was purified further by affinity chromatography as described in Holmberg et al., Bovine aortic endothelial cells BAEs employed for the purification of the inhibitor were isolated from the aorta of cows by the method of Booyse et al., Cloned BAEs were employed for some of the metabolic labelling screenings. These clones were developed from single cells that grew out of a primary cell preparation. Briefly, freshly isolated cells were seeded into 60 mm dishes and allowed to attach overnight. The cells were washed with pre warmed medium, released from the culture dish with trypsin GIBCO, Long Island, NY , dispersed gently with a pipette, and diluted to approximately 20 cells per ml in growth medium. Four to five aliquots 50 microliters each of the diluted cells were then placed on the inverted sterile underside of Cooper dish lids Falcon Plastics, Oxnard, CA and incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature to allow cell attachment. After the position of each of the cellular droplets was marked with a pen, the lids were inverted back onto Cooper dish bottoms containing confluent BAEs in 6.7 ml of growth medium. The confluent BAEs had been maintained in this medium for 24 hours, presumably elaborating growth factors, Gajdusek et al., Confluent monolayers were then washed twice with 15 ml of PBS and subsequently incubated with 15 ml of serum free medium. After 24 hours, the resulting CM was collected, pooled, centrifuged for 5 minutes at 400 x g and, after adding NaN‚ÇÉ and Tween 80 Sigma Chemicals, St. Louis, MO to concentrations of 0.02 percent and 0.01 percent respectively, stored at 30 C until further use. Approximately 1 liter of CM was passed over a 10 ml concanavalin A Sepharose Sigma Chemicals, St. Louis, MO column 1.5 x 5 cm previously equilibrated with phosphate buffered saline PBS containing 0.02 percent NaN‚ÇÉ and 0.01 percent Tween 80 polyoxyethylene 80 sorbitan monooleate , at a speed of 10 ml h at 4 C. After collecting the flow through material, the column was washed with at least 10 column volumes of PBS containing 1M NaCl, 0.01 percent Tween 80 and 0.02 percent NaN‚ÇÉ pH 7.4 to remove non specifically adsorbed proteins. The column was washed with approximately the same volume of this buffer but without the added NaCl, and then eluted in 2 steps. In the first, protein was eluted with 0.01M sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, containing 0.5M alpha methyl D mannoside Sigma Chemicals, St. Louis, MO , 0.02 percent NaN‚ÇÉ and 0.01 percent Tween 80, at a speed of 2.5 ml h. The column was eluted a second time with the same buffer but containing 1M NaCl. The second step in the purification involved preparative SDS PAGE. The inhibitor containing fractions identified by slab gel electrophoresis and reverse fibrin autography were pooled and aliquots 225 microliters were subjected to SDS PAGE in tube gels. When the tracking dye reached the bottom of the gel, the gels were frozen and cut into 1 mm slices. Every two slices were combined and extracted for 24 hours at 4 C with 0.2 ml of PBS containing 0.01 percent Tween. Each extract was then tested for inhibitor activity by the ¬π¬≤‚ÅµI fibrin plate assay described below . The fractions containing the peak of inhibitor activity were pooled and stored at 70 C until further use. The inhibitor also was purified from CM collected from cells cultured in the presence of L 3,4,5 ¬≥H leucine. In this case, the cultures were washed twice with 15 ml of leucine free MEM GIBCO, Long Island, NY and then were incubated in the presence of 15 ml of leucine free MEM containing 20 microCi ml of L 3,4,5 ¬≥H leucine 158 Ci mmol New England Nuclear, Boston, MA . After 24 hours, the media were collected as described above, combined with 55 ml of unlabeled CM, and passed over a 1 ml concanavalin A Sepharose column 0.6 x 3.5 cm at a speed of 4 ml h. The column was washed and eluted at 1 ml h. Again, the inhibitor containing fractions were pooled and subjected to preparative tube gel electrophoresis. The resulting inhibitor containing gel extracts were stored at 70 C until further use. Polyclonal receptors to the purified inhibitor were raised in rabbits as described in detail hereinafter. Protein A Sepharose CL 4B Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Piscataway, NJ was rehydrated in PBS containing 0.02 percent NaN‚ÇÉ, 0.05 percent Tween 20 polyoxyethylene 20 sorbitan monolaurate and 0.1 percent bovine serum albumin, and washed 3 times with a ten fold excess of this buffer. The IgG fraction of the antisera was coupled to the washed beads as specified by the manufacturer at a ratio of approximately 80 micrograms protein A Sepharose per 40 microliters of either anti inhibitor reagent or pre immune serum. The IgG coated beads were added to 1 ml of CM collected from cloned BAEs cultured in the presence of 3,4,5 ¬≥H leucine. The samples were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature, the beads were washed by centrifugation 3 times with 1 ml of PBS Tween buffer and extracted for 1 hour at 37 C with 0.25M Tris HCl pH 6.8 containing 2.2 percent SDS, 20 percent glycerol, 0.025 percent bromophenol blue and 2.5 percent v v 2 mercaptoethanol. The resulting supernatant was analyzed by SDS PAGE in slab gels or by liquid scintillation counting. SDS PAGE in slab 15 x 10 x 0.15 cm and tube 10 x 0.5 cm gels was then performed according to Laemmli, Molecular weight standards employed to determine the apparent molecular weight of the purified inhibitor included phosphorylase B 92,500 , human plasminogen 90,000 , transferrin 77,000 , bovine serum albumin 66,200 , human serum albumin 66,000 , ovalbumin 43,500 , carbonic anhydrase 31,000 , soybean trypsin inhibitor 21,500 , lysozyme 14,400 and the 66,000, 52,300, and 46,500 subunits of human fibrinogen. To localize radiolabeled proteins, the stained slab gels were dried and processed for autoradiography as described in Bonner et al., Alkaline SDS free continuous PAGE was performed as in Hjerten et al., Isoelectric focusing gels were prepared in glass tubes 2.5 mm as in O Farrell, Inhibitor activity in polyacrylamide gels was localized either by direct measurement of the ability of the gel extracts to inhibit u PA mediated lysis of ¬π¬≤‚ÅµI fibrin fibrin plate method of Loskutoff et al., To determine the stability of the inhibitor under denaturing conditions, the purified molecule 20 micrograms ml was incubated for 1 hour at 37 C in 0.02M glycine, pH 2.7, containing 25 micrograms ml of human serum albumin. The sample was neutralized by the addition of three volumes of assay buffer pH 8.1 and subsequently tested at various dilutions made in assay buffer for residual activity by the ¬π¬≤‚ÅµI fibrin plate assay. Inhibitor 20 micrograms ml also was incubated for 1 hour at 37 C in PBS containing 0.025 percent SDS and albumin 25 micrograms ml . The SDS was neutralized by the addition of three volumes of assay buffer containing 0.18 percent Triton X 100 polyoxyethylene 9 octyl phenyl ether , and residual inhibitor activity was measured. Samples treated with PBS instead of glycine and SDS served as controls for these screenings. The effect of acid glycine and SDS on the inhibitor activity of purified protease nexin 160 micrograms ml was determined in a similar manner. Antisera to the inhibitor were raised in New Zealand rabbits by subcutaneous injections of 20 micrograms of purified inhibitor dissolved in 1 ml of saline and emulsified with 1 ml of Freund s complete adjuvant Miles Laboratories, Naperville, IL . Booster injections employing 10 micrograms of purified inhibitor in 0.5 ml of saline and emulsified with an equal quantity of incomplete Freund s adjuvant Miles Laboratories, Naperville, IL were administered at 2 week intervals. Serum containing polyclonal receptors to the inhibitor was collected 10 days after the third and fourth immunisations and pooled. Purified t PA 50 microliters well, 1 microgram ml in phosphate buffered saline PBS was incubated overnight at 4 C in U bottom microtiter plates PVC plastic, Falcon 3911, Microtest III, Falcon, Oxnard, CA . At this and every subsequent step, the plates were washed with SPRIA buffer PBS supplemented with 0.1 percent BSA, 0.05 percent NaN‚ÇÉ and 0.05 percent Tween 20 . To block any remaining sites on the plastic, 3 percent BSA 200 microliters well was incubated in the wells for 1 hour at 37 C. Test samples and standard curves of purified inhibitor were prepared in dilution buffer PBS supplemented with 3 percent BSA, 5mM EDTA, 0.1 percent Tween 80, and 0.02 percent NaN‚ÇÉ and 50 microliters well were incubated for 1 hour at 37 C. Bound inhibitor was detected by incubation for 2 hours 37 C with rabbit anti inhibitor receptor 1 75 dilution in dilution buffer, 50 microliters well . The bound antibody inhibitor t PA complex then was quantitated by incubation for 2 hours at 37 C with ¬π¬≤‚ÅµI labeled goat anti rabbit IgG 5x10‚Å¥ cpm well, Cappel Laboratories, Cochranville, PA . The wells were cut individually and the radioactivity in each well determined in a gamma counter CT 80 800 CT T, General Electric, Milwaukee, WI . Plasminogen was purified from outdated human plasma by affinity chromatography on lysine Sepharose as described in Deutsch et al., The foregoing is intended as illustrative of the present invention but not limiting.
