# Multi stage torsional damping device.

## Abstract
A multi stage torsional damping device 10 for a vehicle clutch having a low rate primary stage to eliminate transmis sion gear rattle occurring during neutral transmission posi tion and a normal rate resilient and friction damping stage. The first stage consists of a low spring rate, frictionless floating suspension of an inner hub 11 within an outer hub 38 to allow the outer hub to oscillate with engine impulses. A medium rate frictionless second stage may be utilized to cushion the torque transference from the first stage to the normal rate last stage and provides compaction of some of the compression springs 59 for the last stage for a given deflection without friction until the hub parts 11,38 abut, and the third stage consists of compaction of all of the compression springs 57,59 and additional deflection with friction. Alternatively, centrifugal weights 71 may be used to lock the inner 11b and outer hubs 38b together at a predetermined rotation level, after which a normal damping operation is effected.
