## Description
Steel wire coated with a meta alloy, reinforcl g Jab4e o4 coArd made from it and objects of elastomeric material reinforced with it, and a process for the manufacture of these steel wires.The invention relates to steel wire, more particularly steel wire having a diameter of 0,05 to 0,75 mm, for reinforcing a material vulcanizable with sulphur to obtain an elastomer, such as rubber for vehicle tyres, which wire is covered with a thin coating of an alloy which at least consists of copper and zine and can be bonded to the elastomeric material during the vulcanization process The invention also comprises reinforcing cable or cord made from these steel wires and objects of elastomeric material reinforced with it, more particularly pneumatic tyres for vehicles. The invention, also relates to a process for the manufacture of said steel wires. Steel wires and processes of the type indicated above are known.For instance in the automobile tyre manufacturing industry large scale use is made for the reinforcement of rubber with steel cord built up from a number of wires or filaments covered with a thin coating of brass. Then the steel cords made up of brass coated wires or filaments are first brought into contact with unvulcanized rubber. Subsequently, the rubber is subjected to a vulcanization treatment in which the adhesion between rubber and brass is effected. The brass coated steel I cords generally make it possible to attain a reasonable adhesion level if the various process conditions, particularly during vulcanization, and the properties and or the state of the starting rubber are accurately controlled.It is generally known that the tyres of both passenger cars and lorries are subjected to severe loading conditions, more particularly high speeds and overloading, and are yet required to have a long life. If the reinforcing steel cord present in the automobile tyre is to perform its function properly, then the bond between cord and rubber must both be strong and permanent. In other words, the adhesion between steel cord and rubber plays an essential role. In this connection the adhesion between cord and rubber has for many years been the subject of a great deal of research both by manufacturers of automobile tyres and manufacturers of steel cord. Particularly as a result of the extremely high dynamic loads to which automobile tyres are subjected nowadays the demands made on the adhesion between steel cord and rubber have become so high that even brass coated steel filaments do not provide satisfacto y adhesion under all circumstances. As to the degree of adhesion, i.e.bonding strength, between steel cord and brass coated filaments a distinction should be made between initial adhesion and adhesion after aging. Initial adhesion is generally determined on cord by means of a tensile tester, the cord having been bonded by vulcanization to rubber which has not undergone any aging treatment. Adhesion after aging may be classified into adhesion after green aging and adhesion after steam aging. In the case of adhesion after green aging the unvulcanized rubbe is previously subjected to an aging treatment in a moist atmosphere, for instance storage for a variable period at 200C 400C and at 90 up to almost 1008 relative humidity.The rubber thus aged is subsequentl bonded by vulcanization to a metal object, such as steel cord formed from filaments coated with a metal alloy, after which the adhesion after green aging is measured on the tensile tester. This green aging treatment causes a change in adhesion between the rubber and the reinforcing wires embedded therein.In the case of adhesion after steam aging a steel object, such as steel cord, coated with a metal alloy is first bonded to non aged rubber by vulcanization. Not until then is the rubber with the object vulcanized therein subjected to an aging treatment under the influence of moisture and heat in the form of steam over a period of, for instance, 4 hours at a temperature of 120 C. After that aging treatment the adhesion after steam aging is measured on the tensile tester.Another important quality demand made on objects bonded to metal objects by vulcanization is the degree of rubber coverage. This is the amount of rubber left on the metal object pulled out of the vulcanized rubber after the tensile test. This amount of rubber is evaluated visually and expressed as a percentage. From said adhesion determinations on brasscoated steel objects it has been found that the adhesion after asin9,i.e after green aging and after steam aging, will often be considerably reduced and may actually become 40 to 100 lower than the initial adhesion,which decrease is partly dependent on the used rubber composition.The invention has for its object to provide a product covered with such a coating as leads to only very little loss of initial adhesion to rubber after aging. The steel wire for reinforcing a material vulcanizable with sulphur, to obtain an elastomer, which wire is covered with a thin coating of an alloy containing copper and zinc and can be bonded to the elastomeric material during the vulcanization process, is characterized according to the invention in that besides copper and zinc the alloy contains 2 19 per cent by weight of nickel, calcu lated on the weight of the coating. According to the invention it is preferred, however, that use should be made of an alloy, containing 4 to 18 per cent by weight of nickel.According to the invention favourable results are guaranteed if the alloy is a mixture which besides zinc contains 50 to 80 per cent by weight of copper and 2 to 19 per cent by weight of nickel. According to the invention it is preferred that the alloy should contain about 60 68 per cent by weight of copper, 20 35 per cent by weight of zinc and 2 19 per cent by weight of nickel.According to the invention the alloy is a ternary alloy of copper, zinc and nickel and the layer thickness of the copper zinc nickel alloy is in the range of 30 to 750 nanometer, which layer can be present wires having a final diameter in the range of 0,05 mm to 0,75 mm.The invention also comprises objects formed from an elastomeric material such as pneumatic tyres for vehicles reinforced with reinforcing ele merits which are formed from said steel wires coated with the special copper zinc nickel alloy according to the invention. The steel wires and the reinforcing cable or cord made therefrom according to the invention are particularly suitable for use in pneumatic tyres for vehicles, and more particularly in the carcasses and or in the belts of vehicle tyres, but their field of application may also include conveyor belts and hoses. The invention further comprises a process for the manufacture of steel wire which, generally after being formed into a cable a cord or mat, can be used for reinforcing an object of elastomeric material, such as a pneumatic tyre, after having beenlbonde to it during vulcanization, the diameter of the starting wire being reduced by drawing to a final diameter in the range of 0,05 mm to 0,75 mm, and the wire is subjected to at least one thermal treatment and is thinly coated with an alloy containing at least copper and zinc, which process is characterized in that use in made of an alloy which besides copper and zinc contains 2 to 19 per cent by weight of nickel, which percentage is calculated on the weight of the coating.A favourable embodiment of the process according to the invention is characterized in that use is made of a metal alloy containing about 60 to 68 per cent by weight of copper, 20 to 35 per cent by weight of zinc and 2 to 19 per cent by weight of nickel.According to the invention said single layer of a ternary copper zincnickel alloy can be applied to a thickness in the range of 30 to 750 mm in a simple manner.The copper zinc nickel alloy according to the invention may be electrolytically applied to the surface of a steel wire whose diameter has been drawn to a value of, say, 1,15 mm. After the alloy has been applied to the steel wire, the latter may be given its final diameter after a number of successive drawing stages.An alloy of 62 wt copper, 20 wt zinc and 18wit nickel may be applied to a steel wire, for instance, by first passing the wire through a first electrolytic bath in which a CuN alloy is deposited on the wire under the following conditions bath composition 200g l K4P207 potassium pyrophosphate 12,5g l Cu,P,G copper II pyrophosphate 50g l NiCI2. 6H20 nickel chloride bath temperature 50 C current density 6 ampjdm2 pH 9 i 1.The result of the first bath is a steel wire coated with 3 grammes of CuNi alloy per kg of steel.Subsequently, the wire coated with this CuNi alloy is passed through a second bath for adding zinc. In this second bath the following conditions should be fulfilled bath composition 300g l ZnSO4. 7H20 zinc sulphate 25g l NH4Cl ammonium chloride 15g l H3B03 boric acid bath temperature 200C current density 6amp dm2 pH 1 4,5. The result of the second bath is that to the wire coated with theCuNi layer there is applied 0,75 g zinc per kg of steel. Next, the resulting wire is dried and kept at 300 C for 5 seconds by resistance heating. The resulting steel wire has a coating of a ternaryCuZnNi alloy made up of 62 wt Cu, 20 wt zinc and 18 wt nickel.An alloy of 54 wtt Cu, 24 wt Zn and 12 wt Ni may be applied to a steel wire by first passing the wire through a first electrolytic bath in which a CuNi alloy is applied to the wire under the following conditions bath composition 200g l K4P207 12,5g l Cu2P20 50g l NiCl2 .61320 bath temperature 50 C current density 4 amp dm2 pH 9 1.The result of the first bath is a steel wire coated with 3 grammes ofCuNi alloy per kg of steel. Subsequently, the wire coated with thisCuNi alloy is pased through a second bath for adding zinc.In this second bath the following conditions should be used bath composition 300g l ZnS04.7H2O 25g l NB C1 15g l H3B03 bath temperature 500C current density 6 amp dm2 pH 4,5.Passing the wire through the second bath results in applying to the wire 1 g of zinc per kg of steel in addition to the previously applied CuNi coating. The resulting wire is dried and kept at 3000C for 5 seconds by resistance heating. The steel wire then obtained has a ternary CuZnNi alloy coating made up of 64 wt Cu, 24 wtz Zn and 12 wt Ni.An alloy of 66 t Cu, 30 wt Zn and 4 wt Ni may be applied to a steel wire by first passing the wire through a first electrolytic bath, in which a CuNi alloy is applied to the wire under the following conditions bath composition 250g l Kip207 50g l Cu2P207 50g l NiCl2.6H20 bath temperature 500C current density 6 amp dm2 pH 9 j 1. The result of the first bath is a steel wire coated with 3g CuNi alloy per kg steel. Subsequently, the wire coated with this CuNi alloy is passed through a second bath for adding zinc. In the second bath the following conditions are used bath composition 300g l ZnSO4.7H2O 25g l NH4Cl 15g l H3BO3 bath temperature 200C current density 6 amp dm2 pH amp dm pH 4,5. The result of the second bath is that on the wire already coated with the CuNi layer 1,25 g of zinc is applied per kg of steel.Next, the resulting wire is dried and kept at 3000C for 5 seconds by resistance heating. The resulting wire has a ternary CuZnNi alloy made up of 66 wt Cu, 3Dwt Zn and 4 wt Mi. Prior to the electrolysis all steel wires must be pickled in the usual manner.Instead of alloys of the above mentioned composition various other copper zinc nickel alloys may be applied to the steel wire, the weight percentage of nickel amounting 2 to 19 . More particularly, the nickel may be used in an amount of 3,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,13,14,15,16 or 17 by weight. If use is made of a weight percentage nickel in the alloy of less than 2 , then no distinct improvement is found to be obtained of the adhesion to rubber of the coated steel wire. If the weight percentage nickel in the alloy is higher than 19 , then the adhesion to rubber will become distinctly inferior to that obtained for the conventional steel wire coated with brass. The electrolytic deposition of the coating according to the invention can be effected in principle also by adding the desired amount of nickel salt to an existing bath commonly used for brass coating.It should be added that from the Netherlands Patent Application 7 101 871 and the corresponding German Application 2 106 226 it is known to cover steel cords with a multilayer, the coating being made up of, inter alia, a copper nickel alloy containing at least 20 nickel.It is preferred then that use should be made of a nickel copper alloy made úp of 60 80t nickel and 40 20 copper. In said patent publication no mention is made of a simple way of applying to an object a single and effective coating according to the invention consisting of a ternary copper zinc nickel alloyThe invention will be further described with reference to a few illustrative embodiments of whi the results are given in Table 1 and in Figures 1 and 2.

With the type Y rubber the initial adhesion of steel covered with a conventional brass coating also is of the same level as when use is made of the CuZnNi coating according to the invention.particularly noticeable is that the adhesion after steam aging 4 hours, 120 C is considerably better when use is made of theCuZnNi coating according to the invention.The table further shows that when use is made of the CuZnNi coating according to the invention the decrease in adhesion after steam aging is only very small, viz. as little as 7 and 3z for the types X and Y, respectively, and probably is to be attributed to the properties of the rubber. The use of a brass CuZn coating, however, leads to a decrease in adhesion after steam aging of as high as 41 and 42 for the types X and Y, respectively. Also the values in brackets of rubber coverage are very favourable for the coating according to the invention. Figures 1 and 2 show the change with time of adhesion under the influence of moisture prior to vulcanization. The adhesion had been determined on rubber after an aging treatment at 200C and 90 relative humidity over periods of one, two and three weeks.TheFigures 1 and 2 relate to the rubber types X and Y, respectively. In 2 the two figures the adhesion is plotted in N 64 mm on the axis in the direction indicated by the arrow I. On the other axis in the two figures the time in weeks is plotted. In both figures the curve 1 indicates the change in adhesion for steel coated with the CuZnNi allo according to the invention, in which the weight percentages Cu,Zn andNi are 62, 20 and 18 , respectively. The curves 2 indicate the change in adhesion for a brass coating containing Cu and Zn in amounts of 65 and 35 per cent by weight, respectively. In both figures the curves 1 and 2 were formed by interconnecting 4 points. The first point of each line lies on the adhesion axis and represents the afore mentioned initial adhesion.The other three points of each of the four. lines relate to adhesion after green agingThe figures 1 and 2 show that for the two rubber types X and Y there is a decrease in adhesion after green aging over a period of three I weeks. From the shape of the upper curves 1, however, it can be seen that when use is made of the coating of the Cu Zn Ni alloy according t the invention the adhesion after green aging decreases only very little, whereas its loss of adhesion is very high when use is made of the conventional brass coating Cu Zn Furthermore, at each of the measuring points in the Figures 1 and 2 a number is placed in brackets which represents the afore mentioned percentage of rubber coverage.These numbers show that when use is made of the coating according to the invention the rubber coverage does not change after green aging for 1,2 and 3 weeks and is maintained at 100 . When use is made of the conventional brass coating, the rubber coverage after 1,2 and 3 weeks is 08. So from the results of comparative adhesion determinations given in the table and in the Figures 1 and 2 it can be seen that the aging behaviour of the adhesion between rubber and steel objects to which a coating according to the invention has been applied should be regarded as particularly favourable.Fig. 6 is a schematic, cross sectional and partly perspective view of an automobile tyre 100. The tyre 100 is in the first place reinforced with a carcass 101, which extends throughout the cross sectional area of the tyre from the left bead 102 to the right bead 102. In the bead regions are chafers 103. Beneath the rubber tread of the tyre is a 2 ply steel belt. The one ply is indicated by 105 and the other ply by 106.Figure 7 is a schematic illustration of the positioning of the reinforcing cords in the carcass 101 and in the plies 105, 106 viewed from the tread 104 of the tyre. It shows that the cords 107 of the carcass 101 run in radial direction of the tyre 100 and make an angle of 900 with the axis 108. The cables or cords 109 of the ply 106 make an angle of 200 with the one side of the axis 108 and the cords 110 of the ply 105 make an angle of 20 with the other side of the axis 108. The reinforcing cables 109 and 110 may be steel cables of the type indicated in Figure 8, which is described in detail in U.S. PatentSpecification 4 022 009.Figure 9 is a cross sectional view of the cable of Figure 8. It shows that the cable is made up of five wires, each having a steel core 111 and a thin coating 112 consisting of the ternary alloy of copper, zinc and nickel according to the present invention.Table IT gives the results of some other experiments for two rubber types A and B commonly employed in the automobile tyre manufacturing industry. The type A rubber contains a cobalt salt. The type B rubber contains an adhesive system made up of a formaldehyde donor, resorcinol and silicic acid.

Table II particularly shows that after a salt test both adhesion and rubber coverage for the CuZnNi alloy according to the invention are very good. This is of great importance in that in winter the steel cord in automobile tyres is actually exposed to the action of brine.Adhision and rubber coverage are also favourable for the steel coated with CuZnNi alloy according to the invention subjected to an ammonia test.The test results mentioned in the Tables I and II and in the Figures 1 and 2 were obtained by carrying out adhesion measurements on plates of the type given in Figure 3. Each plate has a thickness of 0,5 mm and consists of a shank 3 to be clamped in a tester having a length of 22 mm and z width of 4 mm and a square part 4 of 8 x 8 mm.The metal plates were made from homogeneous cold rolled alloys.Figure 4 shows two of these metal plates after they were bonded to a piece of rubber 5 by vulcanization. When a few identical plates are clamped in an Instron tensile tester, thicker additional plates are provided against the thin plates to obtain a better test procedure.The adhesion obtained inthe various runs on the tensile tester is read in Newton, so that when use is made of rubber covered square surfaces of 8 x 8 mm the adhesion is measured in newton 64 mm . The tensile tests for determining the adhesion were carried out at 0 room temperature 20 C and at a tensile rate of 5 mm min on an Instron tensile tester. When the two metal plates are bonded together by vulcanization they are, with the rubber in between them, placed in a vulcanizing press in which they are subjected to a high mechanical pressure. Prior to vulcanization the rubber plate has a thickness of about 2 mm and after vulcanization about 0,5 mm. The elastomeric material to be used on the various objects according to the invention may be composed of different materials or combinations of materials, provided that the elastomeric material displays the desires properties, such as some capability of elastic deformation. And in any case it should bepossible for the elastomeric material to be vulcanized with sulphur.The component substances of the elastomeric material are formed by synthetic and natural polymers displaying plastic deformation behaviour before vulcanization and rubber elastic behaviour after vulcanization, as is more particularly the case with synthetic and natural rubber. As examples of such polymers may be mentioned polypentadiene, polybutadiene, polyisoprene, poly butadiene styrene , poly butadiene acrylonitrile , poly isobutene isoprene , coly chloroprene. Moreover, to the elastomeric material there may have been added the usual fillers, additives and vulcanizing agents, such as carbon black, softening agents, anti oxidants, sulphur, zinc oxide, stearic acid and accelerators.The afore mentioned steel wires are made from steels, such as carbon steel, that are commonly employed for reinforcing automobile tyres.It should be added that by copper zinc nickel alloys are to be understood here one or multi phase, practically solid solutions or intermetallic compounds.U.S. Patent Specification 2 154 834 describes a steel wire to be bonded to rubber, which steel wire is first coated with a layer of zinc and subsequently with a coating of copper and a coating of nickel.Alternatively, the zinc coating may be covered with a copper nickel coating. The steel wire described in said U.S. Patent Specification is therefore always provided with two or three separate coatings, no zinc ever being present in the outer coating, as a result of which of the coated steel wires the adhesion to rubber for automobile tyres will not be optimal. Also U.S. Patent Specifications 2 296 838 and 2 939 207 andBritisch Patent Specification 801 298 describe coated steel wires for reinforcing rubber, the coating consisting of two or three separate layers. These publications do not reveal the steel wires coated with the ternary copper zinc nickel alloy containing 2 19 per cent by weight of nickel according to the invention nor are any particularly favourable properties known from them.Within the scope of the present invention various modifications may be introduced. More particularly, the invention may be applied to thin steel strips or tapes instead of to thin steelwires or filaments.
