# A continuous mailer.

## Abstract
The continuous mailer is provided with a removable tab portion 15 along the top or bottom edge of the back ply 12 . The tab portion has a free flap 19 at one end which can be lifted so that the tab portion can be easily grasped and stripped from the mailer. Removal of the tab portion 15 not only exposes a return mail envelope within the pocket of the continuous mailer but also effects removal of a tab portion on a rear ply of the return mail envelope. The tab portion on the front ply of the return mail envelope can be folded over to seal the pocket of the return mail envelope.
