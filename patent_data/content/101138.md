# A process for methylating the ortho position of a phenol.

## Abstract
By flowing a gaseous stream containing methanol and a phenol through a fluidized bed of particles of a highly attrition resistant catalyst comprising 10 to 80 by weight of silica and 90 and 20 by weight of a metal oxide supported on the silica and have been calcined at 500 to 900 C, the ortho position of the phenol is methylated with high selectivity, whereby various useful ortho methylated phenol derivatives can be advantageously obtained.
