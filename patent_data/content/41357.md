# Suspension polymerisation process for preparing polymer particles.

## Abstract
Polymer particles, and in particular styrenic polymer par ticles, having a uniform particle size distribution are prepared avoiding the formation of fine polymer powders. The suspen sion polymerization process which comprises providing a stirred, aqueous suspension of polymeric seed particles, adding gradually to the suspension styrenic monomer and polymerizing it therein, and continuing the addition of monomer as the polymerization proceeds, may be improved by introducing the styrenic monomer below the surface of the suspension.
