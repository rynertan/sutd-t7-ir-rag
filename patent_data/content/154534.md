# Amorphous metal alloy powders and synthesis of same by solid state chemical reduction reactions.

## Abstract
Amorphous metal alloy powders are synthesised by a solid state reaction. Such reaction may comprise disposing at least one metal bearing compound in a liquid medium and reducing the metal bearing compound so as to obtain a substantially amorphous metal alloy. Precursor components that include the elements of the amorphous alloy are chemically reduced to yield an intimate mixture. The resul tant intimate mixture, as obtained or after heat treating, exhibits amorphous characteristics. These powders are suitable for forming solid amorphous shapes.
