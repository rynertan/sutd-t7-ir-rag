# IMPROVED ACIDIC COMPOSITIONS FOR USE IN ACIDIZING HYDROCARBON BEARING SUBTERRANEAN FORMATIONS AND METHOD FOR USING SAME

## Abstract
Aqueous acidic compositions employed in the acidizing of hydrocarbon bearing subterranean formations comprising aqueous amine modified acidic compositions and mixtures of an acid constituent with the aqueous amine modified acid compositions. The aqueous amine modified acidic composi tions employed in the acidizing of a hydrocarbon bearing subterranean formation are produced by the following steps 1 mixing hydrochloric acid with phosphoric acid 2 admixing the acidic mixture with water 3 admixing of a hydroxy carboxylic acid into the aque ous acidic mixture and 4 admixing a minor effective amount of a polyamine constituent.
