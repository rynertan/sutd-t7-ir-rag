# Apparatus for producing elastic leg disposable diapers.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus is disclosed for attaching a continuously moving elastic ribbon 32,34 to a continuously moving web 30 such that only selected discrete areas of a finished conformable garment fabricated from the web are elasticized. A continuously moving belt 70 formed of plate members 72 hinged together and engaging the continuous ly moving web is guided by cam means 88,90 to cause adjacent plate members to fold and thereby form folds in the web. After folding of the web, the continuously moving elastic ribbon is moved into contact with areas of the web between the folds and is adhered to the web at these areas. The elastic is cut 60 opposite the folded areas of the web corresponding to areas in the finished diaper in which it is desired not to provide elasticization. The belt means is then guided so that the plate members unfold to thereby unfold the web.
