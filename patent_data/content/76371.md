# Process of hydrogenating benzenes and group IVa metal hydride catalysts therefor.

## Abstract
Benzene, or an alkylbenzene, is hydrogenated by reac tion with hydrogen in the presence of a Group IVa or Va metal hydride catalyst. The catalyst maybe a simple hydride such as ZrH₂ or a hydride of an alloy such as Cu₃Zr or may be a complex material. One complex material is the reaction product of a Group IVa or Va metal halide, such as ZrCl₄ with an alkyllithium or aryllithium, such as n butyllithium, in a hydrocarbon solvent.
