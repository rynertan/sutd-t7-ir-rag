# A METHOD OF TRANSMITTING DIGITAL DATA BY MODULATING A HIGH FREQUENCY SIGNAL

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a method of transmit ting digital data by modulating a high frequency signal. The method comprises the steps of converting digital data into a baseband signal, said baseband signal being a low frequency signal which is modulated by the digital data using a first mode of modulation using a local oscillator to produce a high frequency carrier, and modulating the high frequency carrier with the said baseband signal using a second mode of modulation and feeding the resulting modulated carrier to a transmitter.
