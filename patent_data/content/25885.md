# Magnetic recording system.

## Abstract
A carrier wave at a frequency higher than the frequency of an input signal to be recorded is pulse width modulated with the input signal at the pulse width modulator 2 , and the modulated signal thus obtained is supplied to a vertical mag netization recording head 4 . The vertical magnetization recording head 4 is held in contact with a magnetic tape 5 having a rectangular hysteresis characteristic, and the mod ulated signal is recorded by vertical magnetization recording on the magnetic tape 5 . The signal recorded by the vertical magnetization recording is reproduced with a reproducing head 6 having a high sensitivity reproducing characteristic with respect to the input signal component of the pulse width modulation signal recorded on the recording medium 5b and a low sensitivity characteristic with respect to the carrier wave component of the modulation signal.
