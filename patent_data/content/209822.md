# Connecting block for digital system cross connect frame.

## Abstract
A connecting block 24, 26, 28 has printed wiring circuit boards 71,74 to interconnect terminals with jacks and ter minals. The connecting block has a pedestal 32 , which sits on a lower crossarm 34 of a frame 10, 12, 14 and a resilient tang 36 which snaps into an upper crossarm 38 of the frame. The connecting block 24 is suspended to expose the terminals 58, 60, 62, 64, 66, 68, 70, 72 to which conductors 11, 13, 15 are terminated. Each circuit board 71, 74 has two near end and far end contact areas forming a plug. The tip and ring conductors in a test cord are connected, respectively, with the two near end contact areas. A keeper spring connected to ground potential retains the plug within a jack having two long electrical con tacts for the far end contact areas and two short electrical contacts for the near end contact areas. A tracing lamp will flicker for a predetermined period when the plug is inserted within a jack.
