# A bioassay method.

## Abstract
A bioassay method is based on the detection of changes in the membrane potential of individual cells. A cell suspension is incubated with a solution of a substance capable of affecting the physiology of at least a subpopulation of cells in the suspension. During or after the incubation, a measurement representative of the membrane potential of individual cells is made. The preferred method of measuring membrane potential involves incubating the cells with a membrane permeant, fluorescent, ionic dye which becomes distributed on opposite sides of the cell membrane as a function of membrane potential, and then assaying intracellular dye concentration by photometric measurements in a flow cytometer. In one embodiment the cells are modified prior to the photometric measurements this modification may involve reaction with, for example, hormones, pharmacological agents and proteins. One application of the invention is in the evaluation of drugs.
