# Flailing line type trimmers.

## Abstract
A coupling for a handle shaft of a flailing line type trimmer which permits angular adjustment of a drive head. The coupling 18 clamps two parts 20, 22 of the handle shaft together. The coupling prevents rotation of one part and permits the selectible rotation of the other. It is prefer ably formed as a split clamp joining and securely holding the parts in abutment. A pin 32 on the split clamp engages a recess 34 in the end of one handle shaft part to prevent its rotation while a lip 38 on the split clamp engages a circumferential groove 36 in the other handle shaft part to enable it to rotate. A releasable fastener 52 permits loosening of the clamp to allow rotational adjustment of the parts, and their retention at a selected orientation.
