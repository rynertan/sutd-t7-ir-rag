# PROCESS FOR PREPARATION OF BIAXIALLY DRAWN POLY EPSILON CAPRAMIDE FILMS

## Abstract
A biaxially drawn poly ε capramide film having good physical properties and characteristics well balanced be tween the longitudinal direction and the transverse direction can be stably prepared by cooling a film shaped melt of poly ε capramide, drawing the film in the longitudinal direction to form a longitudinally drawn film in which the crystal structure is composed solely of a γ crystal, and then drawing the longi tudinally drawn film in the transverse direction.
