# Improvements in or relating to lubricated bearings.

## Abstract
A lubricated bearing has a rotatable structure which includes a housing 1 with an opening at one end, a bearing cup 2 and a retaining member 3 . The retaining member grips the exterior of the bearing cup and the interior of the housing to secure the bearing cup within the housing with its mouth towards the opening and with lubricant spaces between the housing and bearing cup both above and below its rim 16 . A stationary member 9 has a spherical part 10 which fits within the bearing cup to provide relatively rotatable bearing surfaces and a shaft 11 which extends out of the housing through the opening.
