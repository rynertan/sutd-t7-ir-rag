# Semiconductor memory device.

## Abstract
A semiconductor memory device comprises a plurality of memory blocks 31A, 31B which are divided into a plurality of memory groups and which each include a plurality of memory cells MC and a plurality of word lines WL1, WL2 for selecting the memory cells MC , a plurality of row decoders 14 , provided at least one for each of the memory groups, for selecting at least one of the work lines WL1, WL2 in the memory block 31A, 31B in response to part of a word line selection address signal, and for biasing this selected word line WL1, WL2 with an input drive signal, and a drive signal generating circuit 37 for generating a drive signal for driving the word line WL1, WL2 . This device further includes a drive signal selection circuit 38 for selectively supplying a drive signal from the drive signal generating circuit 37 to the row decoders 14 correspond ing to one of the memory groups specified by the remaining portion of the address signal.
