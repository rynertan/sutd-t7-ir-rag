# Chrominance signal processing apparatus.

## Abstract
In a chrominance signal processing apparatus for process ing a sampled and digitized signal, when a first carrier chrominance signal is frequency converted to a second carrier chrominance signal whose carrier angular frequency is a sec ond reference angular frequency by use of a frequency conver ting signal, the present invention provides an arrangement such that a variation component of a carrier angular frequency from a first reference angular frequency signal which the first carrier chrominance signal has, namely, an angular frequency difference signal is derived by an APC circuit 21, 52 26, 44, 59 the first and second reference angular frequency signals, angular frequency difference signal, and further various kinds of angular frequency signals and phase signals which give necessary functions and performances as a chrominance signal processing circuit are added or substracted in the states of the angular frequency signals and phase signals 25, 44 47, 52 54 thereby simplifying the process for obtaining the above frequency converting signal and thereby reducing the number of circuit elements and the scale in case of realizing this by a digital circuit. In addition, the invention enables the fre quency variation which the first carrier chrominance signal has to be eliminated in a wide frequency range due to its perfor mance, thereby making it possible to perform the accurate fre quency conversion.
