# Method of making an assembly of electrodes.

## Abstract
This invention is directed to the making of an electrode assembly which comprises providing anode electrodes on one surface of a photosensitive glass plate, providing cathode electrodes on the opposite surface of said glass plate oriented transversely to said anode electrodes, and dissolving away the plate material in alignment with said anode electrodes forming slots extending between the surfaces of said plate, thereby placing said anode and cathode electrodes in operative relation with each other.
