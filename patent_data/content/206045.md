# Solvent induced autolysis of cells.

## Abstract
A process to recover proteins, such as enzymes, from yeast cells, which comprises forming an admixture of yeast cells, water, and a minor effective amount of a polychloro ali phatic hydrocarbon, at a suitable pH, and incubating for a suit able time and temperature, such as at room temperature, of about 16 to 90 hours. The resulting supernatent is separated as an aqueous liquid containing a high enzyme activity. En zymes can be recovered, if desired. Typical applications in clude Kluyveromyces fragilis for lactase, Pichia pastoris for al cohol oxidase. Typical solvents include methylene dichloride, 1,1,1 trichloroethane, and chloroform.
