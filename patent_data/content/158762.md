# Production of alloy steels using chemically prepared V2O3 as a vanadium additive.

## Abstract
Process for producing alloy steels wherein a vanadium additive consisting essentially of chemically prepared, sub stantially pure V₂O₃ is added to molten steel as a vanadium additive. The production of the alloy steel involves specifical ly the use of the V₂O₃ as a vanadium additive in an argon oxygen decarburization AOD process.
