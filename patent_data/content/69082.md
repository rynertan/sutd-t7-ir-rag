## Description
Description of the invention entitled . IMPROVEMENTS TO PARAFFINING DEVICES AND PARAFFINING DEVICES. .TENS IMPROVED This invention concerns improvements to paraffining devi . .ces and also the paraffining devices which employ said impro . cements To be more exact, the invention concerns improvements ap . plied to devices for winding machines, whereby said devices can lay a given quantity of paraffin on the yarn so as to re . duce the coefficient of friction of said yarn running on the.guide organs and also to meet the other typical requirements of the paraffining operation. In effect, said devices make it possible to improve the processing of the yarn and thereby the quality of the finished product. To this end it is important that said devices should lay.on the yarn the best quantity of paraffin, for a quantity not great enough does not enable the sliding properties of the yarn to be increased adequately, whereas too much paraffin increases the coefficient of friction of the yarn against the .guide organs and leads to a build up of paraffin and the dirt .ying of said organs, thereby impairing their proper working. . Some devices to paraffin the yarn to be wound are known.which consist of a washer pressed against a revolving disk of paraffin. The yarn to be paraffined is made to run between said washer and said revolving disk and the degree of paraffining. of the yarn is determined substantially by the pressure of said washer against said disk.Such a system is not very sensitive and therefore cannot ensure at all times that the yarn will have the best sliding.properties.One purpose of our invention is to obviate this shortcoming of the known art by improvements to paraffining devices for winding machines. Said improvements enable the best degree of paraffining.to be obtained at all times and the coefficient of friction of the yarn against the guide organs to be reduced to the low est values without damage to the yarn. This is specifically brought about by the use of special ,yarn tensioner means which cooperate with means that position the disk of paraffin axially, whereby the position of at least one of said means can be regulated as wished. The particular cooperation between said means makes it possible to cause the yarn to follow a preferential path at least partly in contact with the front surface and terminal side surface of the paraffin disk. It has been found in the laboratories of this author that an appropriate definition of the particular path of the. yarn in contact with the paraffin enables the best reduction.of the coefficient of friction of said yarn to be obtained. The invention is therefore displayed in improvements to. paraffining devices for winding machines whereby said impro , vements comprise pressing means which press the yarn running.towards the yarn package against a paraffin disk, and whereby said paraffin disk is made to revolve by motor means and is axially positioned by axial positioning means, and whereby said axial positioning means include thrust spring repelling.means balanced by piston means pressing against the disk, said improvements being characterized by comprising yarn tensioner means The invention is also embodied in a paraffining device for winding machines which comprises adjustable pressure means pressing the yarn running towards the yarn package against a disk of paraffin, whereby said disk of paraffin is made to re volve by motor means and is positioned axially by axial posit .ioning means, and whereby said axial positioning means inclu .de thrust spring repelling means balanced by piston means pressing against the disk, said device being characterized by comprising yarn tensioner means. We shall describe hereinafter a preferential embodiment of the invention as a non restrictive example and shall refer .to the attached table, wherein .Fig.I gives a diagram of a side view of a paraffining device improved according to the invention .Fig.2 shows a view from above of the paraffining device of. Fig.I .Fig.3 gives a three dimensional view of the paraffining de vice of Figs. I and 2.In the figures the same parts or parts having the same functions bear the same reference numbers.In particular, the paraffining device 10 of the invention bears a disk or small cylinder of paraffin II, which is made to revolve by a motor, a geared motor in our example, 12 through a telescopic entraining bush 13 and is upheld axially by a drum wise support 14. The disk of paraffin II is kept in its working position.by suitable axial positioning means 15. Said axial positioning means 15 comprise a thrust spring .16 located coaxially around the shaft 17 of the motor 12 within said drum wise support 14. Said thrust spring 16 and said shaft 17 cooperate with the telescopic entraining bush 13 and thrust it outwards and.make it rotate respectively.In particular, the repelling action of said. spring 16 is balanced by the action of a piston 18 pressing against the disk, whereby the position of said piston 18 can be regulated axially by operating a threaded ring nut 19, which clamps said piston 18 to a corresponding support 21. By regulating the axial position of the piston IS pres .sing against the disk II it is possible to locate the disk of paraffin II in a given position axially at right angles in relation to the yarn 22. 3y means of such regulation it is substantially possible to obtain varying contact between the yarn 22 and the front surface 23 of the disk II. Said means for the axial positioning 15 of the disk II cooperate in a coordinated manner with yarn tensioner means ,24 which consist substantially of a specially shaped frame 25 comprising some uprights 28 I28 and some horizontal cross mem bers 26 I26 cooperating with the yarn 22 through tangential porcelain guides 27 secured lengthwise to said cross members ,26 I26. The upright 28 is employed to connect said yarn tensioner means 24 to the supporting frame 20, but the upright 128 can.perhaps be lacking. The horizontal cross members 26 I26 also include, in their part not connected to the specially shaped frame 25, an oblim que development 29 which acts to induct the yarn 22. Said specially shaped frame 35 is located coaxially with the disk of paraffin II and has said tangential yarn 22 guides ,27 placed opposite to the front surface 23 of said disk and outwardly close thereto II Fig,I , In this way it is possible to modify with a varying de gree of gradualness the path of the yarn 22 by making the diskII penetrate axially within the specially shaped frame 25. This is brought about by regulating the axial position of said paraffin disk II by suitably tightening or unscrewing ,the threaded ring nut 19. The yarn 22 thus makes contact with the front surface 23 and at least partly with the end of the side surface 32 of the paraffin disk II, as shown in Fig.I, and in this way an excellent degree of paraffining of the yarn 22 is brought about. Said front surface 23 may possibly be speedily detached and distanced from the yarn 22 by extending the piston 18 by. means of hydraulic or pneumatic pressure. The figures also show the pressing means 33 pressing the ,yard 22 against the front surface 23 of the paraffin disk 11r and the yarn guide taker in 34, which can keep the yarn 22 going up towards the yarn package in the right position. In particular, the pressing means 33 comprise an articul ated 36 head 35 able to adapt itself to any unevenness of the sliding yarn 22 or of the revolving front surface 23 with which it is in at least temporary contact. The improvements in question enable the yarn 22 to be pressed against the paraffin disk II by direct action of said pressing means 33 or by the action of the axial positioning means 15 or by combined action of both said means 33 I5. We have described here a preferential embodiment of the.invention but variants are possible for a person skilled in this field. Thus the shapes and sizes can be changed and it is posss ible to envisage that the yarn tensioner means 24 can be posit .ioned axially by regulating the position of suitable screws 30 clamping the frame 25 to the frame 20 within corresponding slots 31 in the upright 28. It is also possible to visualise means for anchoring said frame 25 which are different from the screw means 30 described and shown, said different means being of a type with their an chorage adjustable by sliding, for instance. . It is further possible to envisage that the thrust pres ,sure of the pressing means 33 can be suitably regulated.these and other variants are all possible for a person skilled in this field within the scope of the idea of the so . lution of the invention.
