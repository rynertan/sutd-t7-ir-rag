# METHOD FOR BONDING RUBBER TO BRIGHT STEEL

## Abstract
A method for bonding rubber to bright steel is provided. The method involves first depositing a coating of cobalt on bright steel by electroless desposition from an aqueous cobalt salt solution having a temperature of from about 70 C to about 100 C. The cobalt coated steel is contacted with the rubber to be bonded and the rubber is then bonded to the cobalt coated steel using heat and pressure. The resultant rubber steel com posite exhibits excellent rubber to steel adhesion.
