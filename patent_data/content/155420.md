# A method for the preparation of a fungal body and a lipid rich in gamma linolenic acid therefrom.

## Abstract
A very efficient microbiological method is proposed for the preparation of γ linolenic acid or a lipid rich in its content of γ linolenic acid as one of the essential fatty acids in the diet of mammals, e.g. humans. The method comprises culturing a fungus of the Mortierella genus including isabelli na, vinacea, ramanniana, ramanniana var. angulispora and nana in a culture medium containing a carbohydrate, e.g. glucose, as the carbon source in an unusually high concen tration of 60 to 400 g liter to grow the fungal body containing a large amount of a lipid rich in its content of γ linolenic acid. A further improvement in the efficiency of culture and the content of the desired fatty acid in the fungal body is obtained by the addition of acetic acid or an alkali metal acetate to the culture medium.
