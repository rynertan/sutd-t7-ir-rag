# Endface assessment.

## Abstract
Features of the endface of a dielectric member are assessed by means of a reflected diffraction pattern. A plurality of light beams 6, 7 which intersect in a region containing the endface 8 can be used to generate a diffraction pattern 10 which subtends an angle of at least 180 at the endface 8. Such a diffraction pattern 10 contains information about the endface 8 and may be used, in particular, to locate the plane in which the endface 8 lies. Embodiments of the invention find particular application in the measurement of endface angles of optical fibres.
