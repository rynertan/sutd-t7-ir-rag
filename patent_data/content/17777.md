# Miniature catheter assembly for negotiating small diameter tortuous blood vessels.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a method for obtaining access to a rela tively inaccessible region of a blood vessel for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes in which a primary catheter tube is inserted into the vascular system at an entry point remote from the relatively inaccessible region, the leading end of the tube is worked towards the inaccessible region in a conventional manner and then a secondary catheter tube contained within the primary tube is everted from the lead ing end of the primary tube to approach more closely to the required region. A catheter assembly for performing the method is also disclosed.
