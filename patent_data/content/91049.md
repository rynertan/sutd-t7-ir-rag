## Description
ZEOLITE L2 133 The present invention relates in general to aluminosilicate compositions ana to tne methoa for their preparation. More particuiarly the invention relates to novei crystalline aluminosilicates of tne zeolite type prepared hyarothermally from a reaction mixture comprising an alkali or an alkaline earth metal oxide, silica, alumina, water ana methyl quinuclictine ions. In tne synthesis of zeolite species, particularly those which are highly siliceous, from reaction mixtures wnich contain organic nitrogeneous or phosphonium bases, it has been speculated that tnese relatively large ionic species serve, at least in part, as templating agents which influence the topology of the crystalline zeolite product, It is apparent, however, tnat other factors in the synthesis process aiso influence tfle structure of the zeolite product since it is known that the same zeolite species can be producea trom reaction mixtures containing quite different organic bases, ana also tnat gels containing the same organic Dase can produce substantially different zeolite structures.For example, both tetraethylammonium and tetrabutylammonium ions can template the formation of zeolite ZS ll U.S.P. 3,709,979 , whereas tetraethylammonium ions can also template the formation of zeolite Beta U.S.P. 3,308,069 .Since there are a number of variable parameters in the synthesis process, it is usually quite aifficult to determine precisely whicn particular value of which particular parameter or parameters are determinative of the structure of the crystallizea product. Frequently, more than one zeolite species is produced in a given synthesis. As reportea in our copending applicationSerial No. filed contemporaneously with the present application, methylquinuclidine ion is capable of templating the formation of a novel zeolite species, aenominated LZ 132, from a reaction mixture containing same in combination with water, soda, alumina and silica. LZ 132 is topologically related to the mineral levynite and also to the synthetic zeolite species vK 20. We have further found that the same reaction mixture which produces LZ 132 also produces another novel zeolite species, denominated LZ 133, whose crystal structure is as yet unknown, but is likely to be topologically related to LZ 132, ZK 20 and levynite. The X ray powder ditfraction pattern of LZ 133, however, clearly establishes it as a distinct zeolite species. The mineral zeolite levynite has been known since 1825 and has an idealized chemical composition expressed in terms of mole ratios of oxides as CaO A1203 4 Six, 6 H20. Levynitek s crystal symmetry is hexagonal with unit cell parameters a0 13.32 A and c0 22.51 A. TheX ray powder diffraction pattern of levynite is given in Zeolite Molecular Sieves , D.W.

Zeolite LZ 133, the novel aluminosilicate zeolite species or the present invention, differs substantially in its chemical composition from either of tne atoresaia ZK 20 and levynite materials as well as having a distinguishing X ray powder aiffraction pattern. LZ 133 has a chemical composition expressed in terms of mole ratios of oxiaes as X M2 n0 AL2O3 y Si zH2O wherein M is at least one cation having the valence n , x nas a vaiue or from zero to 3.5, y has a value of from 10 to 80, preferably 15 to 50 and z nas a value of from zero to 15, preferably zero to 5, said aluminosilicate having anX ray powaer diffraction pattern containing at least the 6 spacings of Table III, Table IV or Table V, below.

The raaiation was the K alpha doublet of copper, ana a Geiger counter spectrometer with a strip chart pen recorder was employea. The peak heights and their positions as a function of 2 times tneta, where theta is tne Bragg angle, were read from the spectrometer chart and the interplanar spacings in Angstroms corresponaing to the recorded lines were determined. As synthesizea, the chemical composition of LZ 133 in terms of mole ratios of oxides is a Q2 nO b R2O Al2O3 c SiO2 d H2O wherein a has a value in the range of 0.1 to 1.5, Q ss an alkali metal or alkaline eartn metal cation having the valence n , b has a value in the range or 0.5 to 2.5, the value of a b is from 0.9 to 3.5, R represents the methylquinuciidine ion, c has a value of from 10 to 80 preferably 15 to 50, and d has a value of from zero to about 15, aepending upon the degree or dehyaration and the degree to which the intracrystalline pore volume is occupied by the organic or metal cation species.The as synthesizea form of the zeolite, which can include the dehydratea activated form, but not the form which results from ion exchange or calcination at a temperature sufticiently high,i.e.,at least 400 C, but preferably 500 C 650 C., to decompose the organic constituents, has a characteristic X ray powder diffraction pattern which contains at least the a spacings set torth in Table IV below TABLE IV 2 theta d A Relative Intensity 13.5 0.2 6.66 6.46 M 13.7 0.2 b.56 6.37 M t4.2 0.2 6.33 6.15 M 17.3 0.3 5.21 5.04 M 19.2 0.3 4.70 4.55 VS 19.7 0.2 4.55 4.46 M 24.3 0.3 3.71 3.62 S 25.7 0.2 3.49 3.44 M 27.3 0.2 3.29 3.24 M 27.9 0.3 3.23 3.16 M 28.5 0.2 3.15 3.11 M 29.6 0.2 3.04 3.00 M The organic catlons ot tne as synthesized zeolite are not considered to be ion exchangeable in the ordinary sense aue to steric considerations of the crystal structure, the organic cations themselves and the positions occupied Dy these cations within the crystal lattice.These large organic cations, moreover, tend to block the pore system ana prevent the normal passage of the smaller metal cation species into ana out of the crystal structure by the conventional ion exchange mechanism. It is possible, however, to thermally or chemically decompose the organic cation species as well as any occludea organic moieties to molecular or atomic fragments small enough to be removed.tnrough the pore system. Tne organic cations associated with A104 tetrahedra can be converted by this procedure to ammonium or hyarogen cations which are ion exchangable in the usual manner.Calcination of tne as synthesized zeolite in air at a temperature of at least 4000C, preferably 5000C to 6500C. for one hour, is sufficient to create the methylqulnuclidine free decationized form. Lower temperatures and or shorter calcination periods are requirea to accomplish this result if the calcination is carriea out under vacuum conditions. As will be readily apparent to those skilled in this art, the ratio of the combined organic metallic cations to framework aluminum can appear to be substantially higner in the as synthesized form ot the zeolite than stoichiometric considerations basea on conventional zeolite chemistry would permit. This phenomenon is not unique to LZ 133, however, and has yenerally been observed in high silica zeolites synthesized from an organic containing system. While the exact condition of each organic ana metal cationic moiety of the zeolite are not known, it can be theorized that at least some of the organic species are merely occluded in the structure, and in aadition entrap alkali or alkaline earth species which are not present in association with A104 tetrahedra.In any event there is no doubt that the topology ofLZ 133 is essentially zeolitic. It is further notea that upon calcination at temperatures sufficiently high to decompose the organic species present, the X ray powder diffraction pattern of LL 133 cnanges somewhat. The most notable changes appear in the intensity values for a number of a spacings. Some snifting in line positions are also notea as well as the appearance or disappearance OI one or more lines attributed to the removal of the organic species.These changes do not, however, indicate a change in the basic topology of the zeolite structure, the X ray powder ditfraction pattern of which is set forth in Table V below TABLE V 2 tneta, d A Relative Intensity 13.5 0.2 6.66 6.46 S 13.7 0.2 t.56 6.37 S 14.2 0.2 6.33 6.15 S 17.3 0.3 5.21 5.04 W 19.2 0.3 4.70 4.55 S 19.7 0.2 4.55 4.46 M 24.3 0.3 3.71 3.62 MS 25.7 0.2 3.49 3.44 M 27.3 0.2 3.29 3.24 M 27.9 0.3 3.23 3.16 M 28.5 0.2 3.15 3.11 M 29.6 0.2 3.04 3.00 The organic free form of the zeolite, such as preparea by the calcination ot as synthesized LL 133 aescribea aDove, either per se or after subsequent ion exchange, nas tne chemical composition in tne anhydrous state in terms ot mole ratios or oxides x M2 nO Al2O3 ySiO2 wnerein M is an ammonium, hyarogen or metal cation, x has a value of zero to 1.1, y has a value of 10 to 80, preferably 15 to 50, said zeoiite having an X ray powaer aiffraction pattern containing at least the d spacings set fortn inTable V, supra. As indicated hereinbefore, LZ 133 andLZ 132 are generally produced together as co crystallization products from the same reaction gel. The proportions of each species proaucea is depenaent upon the value of the various process parameters involved. It appears that the use of silica sols as the silica source in the reaction mixture, lower reaction temperature and longer crystailization times tend to to ravor the proauction of LZ 132, possibly by the reconversion of previously formea LZ 133 which is favored by relatively higher reaction temperatures, shorter crystallization times ana the use of precipitatea amorphous silica as the principal silica source in the reaction gel. Accordingly zeolite LZ 133 can be prepare hydrothermally by crystallization from a gel whose composition expressea in terms of mole ratios of oxides falls within the following ranges 1.0 Al2O3 10 80 SiO2 0.3 5.6 R2O 1.0 5.0 Q2 nO 160 600 H2O wherein R represents the methylquinuclidine ion, W represents an alkali metal or alkaline earth cation, preteraDly an alkali metal cation such as sodium, potassium or cesium, and n is the valence of the saia metal cation. Preferably, the gel composition expresseu in terms or mole ratios of oxiaes shoula fall within tne following ranges.1.0 Al2O3 15 50SiO2 2.0 4.0 methylquinuclidine 2O 1.0 4.5 Na2O 350 450H2O In preparing the aqueous reaction mixture the conventional reactants usea in zeolite synthesis are suitably employea. Alumina can be obtained from activatea alumina, alpha alumina, gamma alumina, boehmite, pseuao boehmite, alumina trihydrate, aluminum hydroxide or soaium aluminate. Silica can be obtainea from precipitated silica, soaium silicates, silica sol, or silica aerogel, preferably precipitated silica. avantageously, the crystallization procedure is carried out at temperatures in the range of from aDout 100 C to 200 C, preferably at 1250C to 150 C, the pressure being autogenous pressure, until the proauct is crystallized. The crystalline product is then fiitered, washed ana driea. The methoa for preparing zeolite LZ 133 is illustrated by the following examples.Example 1 a Preparation ot metnylquinucliaine hydroxide MeQOH . Initially 126.2 grams of quinuciiblne i azabicyclo 2,2,2 octane were dissolved in 126.2 grams or water in a one liter 3 neck rouna bottom flask fittea with a condenser, a thermometer ano a mecnanical giass stirring roa with an inert plastic crescent stirring blaae. Using a constant aroppiny funnel, i62.5 grams of methyi iodide CH3I were slowly adaea into the quinuclidine solution with vigorous mixing. A temperature rise of 530C was oDservea. After the completion of the aaditon or methyi ioaide solution, the entire solution was mixed vigorously for another 20 hours. A total of about 415 grams of solution proauct was recovered Calc. 69.5 wt.

The resulting final reaction gel was thoroughly mixea and had a molar oxide composition of 1.0 Al2O3 27.3 SiO2 3.6 Na2O 5.6 8B16NI 420 H2O. The syntnesis yel was then placed in a poiytetrafluoroethylene container which in turn was sealed in a stainless steel pressure vessel and digestea at 2000C for 45 hours. The solid reaction proauct was recoverea by filtration, wasnea with water and aries at ambient temperature. The proauct was identified by X ray aiffraction as zeoliteLZ 133.

ADout 5 grams of the sample 20 40 U.S. Standara mesh was placed in a 1 2 inch O.D.quartz tube reactor and activated in situ for 60 minutes 3 at 5000C in a flowing 200 cm min. stream of dry helium. Thereafter a feedstock consiEting of a mixture of 2 mole n butane in helium was passed over the catalyst sample at the rate of 50cm3 min. for a period of 40 minutes. Tne product stream was analyzed at 10minute intervals. The pseudo first oraer reaction rate constant ka was then calculated to determine the catalytic activity of the zeolite LZ 133. The k a value for the calcined LZ 133 sample was found to be 3.8 as compared to a K value of 1.1 for NH4 Y zeolite. Tne hydropnobic surface characteristics of LZ 133 are very similar to those of LZ 132. The characteristics of the latter zeolite, in this regard, were demonstrated using an ethanol water shake test. A one gram sample of a stepwise calcined sample of Example l b was added to a small serum bottle. The stepwise calcination procedure consisted of raising the sample temperature to 1000C., followed by a heat up rate of l000C hr., with an intermittent holding time of one hour when the temperature reached 200 , 3000, 4000 ana 5000C, until the final temperature reached 5900C. During the heat up time, the sample was under a nitrogen purge. When the temperature reached 5900C, 5.0 vol. of C2H5 OB in H 20 solution was introduced. The bottle was sealed ana shaken tnroughly. The liquid was anaiyzea by gas chromatography and the result indicatea a total of 14.9 ethanol removal. For comparison, acia washea silicalite removed 23 ethanol from the same solution.
