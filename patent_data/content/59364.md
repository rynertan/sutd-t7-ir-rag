# Orange pigments of spinel structure.

## Abstract
The present invention is directed to orange inorganic pigment materials which are characterized by high tinctorial strengths, excellent color and thermal stabiliity and relatively high opacity. These pigments are of inverse spinel structure and are produced by cocalcining compounds of iron and zinc with compounds of titanium, tin and or silicon.
