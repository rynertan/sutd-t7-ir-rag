# THERMOSETTING COATING COMPOSITION

## Abstract
Novel solvent based thermosetting composition com prising a hydroxy functional epoxy ester resin of number average molecular weight Mn between about 1,000 and about 5,000, being formed by reaction of diepoxide, which has been chain extended with dicarboxylic acid reactant and, optionally, diphenol reactant, with hydroxy functional secondary amine in chain terminating reaction, in ap proximately 1 1 molar equivalent ratio and b polyfunc tional, hydroxy reactive crosslinking agent, for example, aminoplast crosslinking agent or blocked polyisocyanate crosslinking agent comprising isocyanate groups blocked by reaction with an active hydrogen bearing blocking agent. Coating composition may be formulated as primer spray able with conventional spraying equipment.
