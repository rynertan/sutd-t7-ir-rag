## Description
The present invention relates to a maturated moldable sheet molding compound and deals with the development of a dual functional additive system for thermoset polyester resins which imparts improved glass read out, enhanced pigmentability and superior low shrink properties over the known prior art, thereby producing an overall improved Class A quality surface finish for thermoset polyester resin products. Further, the dual functional additive is compatible with other conventional low shrink additives as may be added to the thermoset polyester resin, and may or may not be used with them, a significant improvement in dynamic impact properties is obtained over that exhibited by any of the known prior art. The dual functional additive system comprises the dual thickening system comprised of metallic oxides and hydroxides of calcium or magnesium as described in US A 4,067,845 and an additional isocyanate terminated urethane prepolymer which has an NCO OH ratio within the range from 1.2 1 to 5 1 and preferably an NCO OH between 1.8 to 3. The dual functional additive system provides that the isocyanate terminated urethane prepolymer becomes covalently bonded to the thermoset polyester resin matrix of the polyester resin product. It should be emphasized that, insofar as is known, none of the conventional low shrink additives contained within the prior art covalently bonds with the thermoset polyester resin material. By virtue of being covalently bonded to the thermoset polyester resin, the new additive imparts improved dynamic impact properties to the thermoset polyester resin product. Finally, this new isocyanate terminated urethane additive, when used in conjunction with the teachings of US A 4 067 845, serves a dual purpose as a low shrink additive to allow greater predicability of so called shrinkage during formation of thermoset polyester resin material products, and aids in the thickening process during maturation. Low shrink additives comprised of a polyisocyanate and a polyether polyol for use in thermoset polyester resin products to minimize shrinkage experienced by the thermoset polyester resin product during final cure are old and well known in the prior art. The dual functional additive for use with the present invention in thermoset polyester resin products incorporates the dual thickening system of US A 4 067 845, comprises an isocyanate terminated urethane prepolymer additive based upon a polyioscyanate and a polyether or polyester polyol, and preferably a polyether polyol, which acts in concert with NCO, etc. to thicken the system and impart improved viscosity index to the polyester matrix as explained in US A 4 067 845, and, at the same time, imparts superior dimensional change predictability to the thermoset polyester resin product during final cure than would otherwise be obtainable by using the dual thickening system of US A 4 067 845. Further, by virtue of the fact the dual functional additive covalently bonds to the thermoset polyester resin, the resulting product possesses improved dynamic impact properties than would otherwise be expected from using any of the conventional low shrink additives of the prior art alone, as well as superior high temperature property retention. The isocyanate terminated urethane prepolymer is made in a one step prosess and has an NCO OH ratio of 1.2 1 to 5 1, and preferably an NCO OH ratio of 1.8 to 3 and is made by combining one equivalent of a polyol, preferably polyether polyol having a molecular weight of 600 to 4,000 and a functionality of 2 to 6, and preferably 2, with two equivalents of a polyisocyanate and preferably a di isocyanate and 0 to 1 of any conventional urethane catalyst, such as stannous octoate, dibutyltin dilaurate and the like , said amount to vary according to the total weight of the urethane. This dual functional additive may or may not be dissolved in a ethylinically unsaturated monomer, such as styrene. As previously mentioned, this dual functional additive is contemplated for use with the dual thickening system of US A 4 067 845 to aid in the thickening process and improve viscosity index, and by virtue of the fact that the additive is isocyanate terminated, covalent bonding to the thermoset polyester resin material is facilitated, thereby enhancing the dynamic impact properties of the thermoset polyester resin material. Finally, the use of this additive allows greater predictability of dimensional changes to be expected from the thermoset polyester product during final cure than is otherwise obtainable, insofar as is known, from any of the conventional low shrink additives of the prior art. US A 4 067 845 describes a dual thickening system for use in the production of a moldable thermoset polyester resin composition. This dual thickening system is an oxide or hydroxide of calcium or magnesium, and preferably magnesium, and is used in conjunction with a polyisocyanate to impart improved molding characteristics to the thermoset polyester resin than would otherwise be obtained from using only oxides and or hydroxides of calcium and magnesium. This differs from the present invention by reason that the polyisocyanate does not include an isocyanate terminated urethane prepolymer based upon a polyester polyol or a polyether polyol or a mixture thereof and a polyisocyanate. The dual functional additive system contemplated by the present invention deletes the organic polyisocyanate, and instead substitutes from the dual thickening system an isocyanate terminated urethane prepolymer based upon a polyether polyol or a polyester polyol or a mixture thereof, to impart better low shrink predictability than would otherwise be expected from using the system as taught by US A 4 067 845 alone, while acting as a thickener for improved molding characteristics. The use of Isonate 143 L according to US A 4 067 845 does not provide these improved shrinkage characteristics. GB A 2045259 discloses a urethane dominated low shrink additive for use in thermoset polyester resin products. The low shrink additive is based upon a polyester or polyether polyol or mixture thereof, preferably a polyether polyol, a polyisocyanate, and an isocyanate reactive unsaturated monomer, preferably hydroxyalkylacrylate, whereby the OH groups of the monomer react with the NCO groups on the intermediate prepolymer based on the polyether polyisocyanate thereby capping off the NCO and exposing a double bond for later reaction. The urethane low shrink additive of GB A 2 045 259 is made in a two step process. Specifically, an isocyanate terminated prepolymer is made based upon either a polyether polyol or a polyester polyol as outlined above, and a polyisocyanate whereby an isocyanate terminated prepolymer is created having a ratio of NCO OH of approximately 1.02 1 to approximately 1.6 1 and preferably 1.1 1 to 1.4 1. The isocyanate groups are then reacted with an isocyanate reactive unsaturated monomer selected from among suitable esters, amides or alcohols, and preferably with hydroxethyl acrylate. This reaction should result in a final free NCO content preferably in the range of 0 1 and most preferably in the range of 0 .5 of free NCO. The reaction of the isocyanate terminated prepolymer with the unsaturated monomer described above results in a controlled molecular weight oligomer with terminal unsaturation. The additive of GB A 2 045 259 is a low shrink additive and does not, in stark contrast to the present invention, take part in the thickening process using the dual thickening system as described in US A 4 067 845. Moreover, the dual function additive isocyanate terminated urethane polymer of the present invention does not provide terminal unsaturation, as does the low shrink additive of GB A 2 045 259. Rather, the dual functional additive of the present invention is terminated by NCO groups which react with the terminal OH groups of a thermoset polyester resin and covalently bond thereto, to provide low shrink advantages and higher impact properties, as will be described herein, and in conjunction with the dual thickening system of US A 4 067 845, act as a thickener for the thermoset polyester resin for improved molding characteristics. The low shrink additive as described in GB A 2 045 259 depends upon reactions with the terminal reactive unsaturation of the prepolymer for its low shrink properties. Further, the present invention provides for an NCO OH ratio of 1.2 1 to 5 1, and preferably an NCO OH ratio between 1.8 to 3. Thus, the mechanisms of the reaction of the respective low shrink additives are vastly different. EP A 0074746 relates to a thermosetting polyester resin composition which includes a select polyurethane oligomer to improve impact properties and surface characteristics of the thermoset polyester resin composition. These polyester resin systems as embodied in EP A 0074746 give increased impact properties as well as low shrink characteristics to the polyester resin system. However, the manner in which these ends are achieved differs from the present invention. Specifically, polyurethane chemical system employed in EP A 0 074 746 is formed by the reaction of a hydroxyl terminated prepolymer with dicarboxylic acid anhydrides. The present invention does not use dicarboxylic acid anhydrides to form the prepolymer. Moreover, the NCO OH ratio of the polyurethane oligomer of EP A 0 074 746 is about 0.3 1 to about 0.99 1 whereas in the present invention, the NCO OH ratio is from between 1.2 1 to 5 1 and preferably 1.8 1 to 3 1. The system as defined in EP A 0 074 746 would give rise to fiber readout problems which are overcome in the present invention. In addition, EP A 0 074 746 emphasizes the use of chain extenders to lengthen the prepolymer of that invention. The average molecular weight of the polyol used is about 300 to about 10,000, which is different than the present invention wherein the range of 600 to 4,000 is preferred. Further, EP A 0 074 746 prefers a polyester polyol whereas in the present invention, polyether polyols are the preferred polyol reactants. In addition, the polyurethane oligomer that is utilized according to EP A 0 074 746 is a hydroxy terminated prepolymer whereas in the present invention, the prepolymer is isocyanate terminated. Further, the polyurethane oligomer of EP A 0 074 746 is reacted with a dicarboxylic acid whereas in the present invention, such is not the case. Finally, the present invention is contemplated for use with the dual thickening system of US A 4 067 845 to aid as a thickener as well as a low shrink additive to form a thermoset polyester resin product having good low shrink characteristics and dynamic impact properties. Because of the hydroxyl termination of the prepolymer to be used with the system of US A 4 067 845, the present invention differs from EP A 0 074 746. US A 4 424 333 relates to the modified polyurethane liquid polymer composition comprised of a polyurethane oligomer containing terminal ethylenic unsaturation. The polyurethane oligomer contemplated is prepared by reacting an organic polyisocyanate and a polyether polyol to form an oligomer and then reacting this product with an isocyanate reactive group containing an unsaturated monomer selected from appropriate acrylates and acrylomides or mixtures thereof, and preferably hydroxyethylacrylate to produce the terminal unsaturation. The polyol used should have an average molecular weight of approximately 75 to approximately 500, and preferably 100 to 200, and a functionality of at least 3, and preferably 3 8 and most preferably 4 6. The ratio of NCO OH in the polyurethane oligomer of US A 4 424 333 is approximately .8 1 to approximately 2 1 and preferably 1 1 to 1.2 1. It is believed that, aside from the differences in molecular weight and NCO OH ratios, the polyurethane oligomer of US A 4 424 333 cannot be used with the dual thickening system of US A 4 067 845. WO 85 00175 refers to low temperature, storage stable, liquid mixtures of 1 isocyanato containing prepolymers obtained from the reaction of polyols and a polyisocyanate, and 2 a non hydroxyl containing flow modifier which is compatible with the prepolymer US A 4115429 also refers to a low temperature , storage stable liquid diisocyanate compound. Both these references do not disclose the diisocyanate compound as a component of a sheet molding composition. US A 4439577 refers to a heat curable, liquid polymer composition which comprises a modified polyurethane oligomer containing terminal ethylenic unsaturation and a free radical generating catalyst. US A 4062826 discloses shaped polymeric articles of a gel polymerisate of a homogenous mixture of a 5 to 95 per weight of polyurethane precursors comprising at least one polyfunctional compound and at least one diisocyanate, said precursors being capable of forming a cross linked polyurethane having a glass rubber transition temperature of at least 25 , and b from 95 to 5 by weight of cured polyester resin precursors, comprising i at least one ethylenically unsaturated polyester and ii at least one vinyl monomer. As previously stated, the present invention is a dual functional additive which aids the dual thickening system of US A 4 067 845 and covalently bonds to the thermoset polyester resin of such a product to present predictability of dimensional changes of such a product during final cure such as could not be expected by the use of the known system alone. US A 4 424 333 cannot, because of its ethylenic terminal unsaturation, aid the dual thickening system of US A 4 067 845. Further, the polyether polyol contemplated for use with the present invention has a molecular weight of 600 to 4,000, a functionality of 2 to 3, and preferably 2, and an NCO OH ratio, after reaction to form the isocyanate terminated urethane prepolymer of the present invention of 1.2 1 to 5 1, and preferably an NCO OH ratio between 1.8 and 3. Thus, the present invention differs from the prior art. Subject matter of the present invention is therefore a maturated moldable sheet molding compound according to claim 1 preferred further developments of this composition are specified in claims 2 to 5. The isocyanate terminated urethane prepolymer of the present invention is based upon a polyether polyol and a di isocyanate or polyisocyanate. The polyol is preferably a diol or triol having a molcular weight of 600 to 4,000, and preferably about 2,000, as exemplified by BASF s Pluracol P 2010, and a functionality of 2 to 6, and preferably 2 to 3 and more preferably 2. The dual functional additive of the present invention is formed in a one step addition reaction between one equivalent weight of the polyol as described above and two equivalent weights or the polyisocyanate in the presence of 0 1 of a conventional urethane catalyst such as stanneous octoate, dibutyltin dilaurate and the like, and the amount of such catalyst is determined according to the total weight of the urethane. The isocyanate terminated urethane additive thus formed should have an isocyanate to hydroxyl ratio NCO OH of 1.2 1 to 5 1, and preferably NCO OH between 1.8 to 3, and most preferably 2. The dual functional additive of the present invention is contemplated for use with thermoset polyester resin products to which it is covalently bonded to provide improved dynamic impact qualities such as could not be expected, insofar as is known, with any low shrink additive contained within the prior art. In addition, this additive provides greater low shrink predictability than would otherwise be expected from any of the conventional low shrink additives contained within the known prior art. Further, by replacing the organic polyisocyanate of US A 4 067 845 with the isocyanate terminated urethane prepolymer of the present invention, the additive acts as a thickener for the thermoset polyester resin to which it is added, rendering the matured paste to have improved molding characteristics. The isocyanate terminated urethane prepolymer is prepared by first reacting an organic polyisocyanate, and preferably a di isocyanate with a polyol, using standard procedures to yield an isocyanate terminated prepolymer of controlled molecular weight and having an NCO OH ratio of 1.2 1 to 5 1, and preferably NCO OH between 1.8 to 3, and most preferably 2. The polyisocyanates used in the formation of the present invention include toluene di isocyanate, such as the 80 20 or 65 35 isomer mixture of the 2,4 and 2,6 isomeric forms, ethylene di isocyanate, propylene di isocyanate, meta and para phenyl di isocyanates, 4,4 diphenyl methane di isocyanate MDI or a mixture of MDI and its trifunctional cyclic adduct products containing carbiodiimide linkages, 1,5 napthalene di isocyanate, para and meta xylene di isocyanates, tetra methylene di isocyanate and hexamethylene di isocyanate, The exact polyisocyanate employed is not critical, but di isocyanates are preferred, and of these, 4,4 diphenyl methane di isocyanate MDI or a mixture of MDI and its trifunctional cyclic adduct products containing carbodiimide linkages are preferred. It should be noted that differing results in respect to low shrinkage additives will be obtained by the use of different polyisocyanates and it must be emphasized that di isocyanates are preferred. The polyol reactant used in the dual functional additive is a polyether polyol or mixtures of two or more such polyether polyol compounds. The polyol reactant, or mixture thereof, used has an average equivalent weight of between 600 to 4000 and a functionality of between 2 and 6, and preferably 2 to 3 and more preferably 2. Among suitable polyether polyols, it is contemplated that polyoxyalkylene polyols and mixtures thereof may be used. These can be prepared according to well known methods, by condensing an alkylene oxide, or mixture of alkylene oxides using random or stepwise addition, with a polyhydric initiator or a mixture of polyhydric initiators. The alkylene oxides contemplated for use include ethylene oxides, propylene oxide, butylene oxides, amylene oxide, aralkylene oxides, such as trichlorobultylene oxide and such, and the most preferred alkylene oxide is propylene oxide or a mixture thereof with ethylene oxide using random or stepwise oxyalkylation. Polyhydric initiators used in preparing the polyether polyol reactant include a aliphatic diols such as ethylene glycol, 1,3 propylene glycol, 1,2 propylene glycol, butylene glycols, butane diols, pentane diols and the like, b the aliphatic triols such as glycerol, trimethylolpropane, triethylolpropane, trimethylolhexane and the like, c the polyamines such as tetraethylene diamine and d the alkanolamines such as diethanolamine, triethanolamine, and the like. Preferably, the polyhydric initators of choice for use in preparing the polyether polyol reactant is an aliphatic diol or triol such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, glycerol, trimethylolpropane and the like. If a polyester polyol is selected for use as comparison to the polyol reactant of the dual functional additive of the present invention, such a polyol is usually formed by reacting a polycarboxylic acid with a polyhydric initiator, such as a diol or triol. The polycarboxylic acids include oxalic, malonic, succinic, glutaric, adipic, pimelic, subelric, azelaic acid, and the like. Illustrative polyhydric alcohols include various diols and triols and higher functionality alcohols such as ethylene glycol, 1,3 propylene glycol, 1,2 propylene glycol, butylene glycols, butane diols, pentane diols, glycerol, trimethylolpropane, trimethylolhexane, hexane 1,2,6 triol and the like. When a polyether polyol reactant is to be created by the alkylene oxide polyhydric initiator reaction, usually a catalyst such as KOH, as is well known in the prior art, is added to speed up the reaction. The resulting polyether polyol should have an average molecular weight of 600 to 4,000. After reaction, the catalyst is preferably removed, leaving a polyether polyol suitable for reaction with the polyisocyanate reactants as discussed above to form the isocyanate terminated urethane prepolymer of the present invention. In forming the isocyanate terminated urethane prepolymer which comprises the present invention, one equivalent weight of the polyol reactant as defined above is reacted with 1.2 to 5, and preferably two equivalent weights of a polyisocyanate as defined previously in the presence of any conventional urethane catalysts such as stannous octoate and dibutyltin dilaurate and the like, whereby the isocyanate groups are placed on the terminal ends of the prepolymer, thereby yielding the isocyanate terminated urethane prepolymer of the present invention. It should be noted that the prepolymer may be made in the presence of an ethylinically unsaturated monomer, such as styrene, or that a monomer may be added to it after it has been made without adversely affecting its function as a low profile additive to impact the advantages described herein. The isocyanate terminated urethane prepolymer additive of the present invention may or may not be used with any of the conventional low shrink additives of the prior art, such as polyvinyl acetate and polymethyl methacrylate or a mixture thereof, or any other linear oligomer having a molecular weight within the range of 10,000 to 90,000. Moreover, regardless of whether or not the prepolymer of the present invention is used with a conventional low shrink additive, the ratio of the total amount of prepolymer to polyester resin should optimally be within the range of 10 parts by weight of prepolymer to 90 parts by weight of polyester resin, to 60 parts by weight of prepolymer to 40 parts by weight of polyester resin. The SMC contemplated for use with the present invention is comprised essentially of the following ingredients a an unsaturated polyester resin having 1 a ratio of hydroxyl groups to carboxyl groups of between 5.7 and 8.2, and 2 an acid number of at least 14, and 3 an average molecular weight between 800 and 5,000 b a dual thickening system comprised of the isocyanate terminated urethane prepolymer of the present invention in an amount sufficient to react with at least 10 percent, but not more than 105 percent of the hydroxyl groups present, and a metallic oxide or hydroxide selected from Group IIA of the periodic table and consisting of calcium and magnesium oxides or hydroxides in an amount to react with at least 30 percent, but not more than 75 percent of the carboxyl groups present c an ethylinically unsaturated monomer and a free radical polymerization catalyst d an inert filler e fiberous reinforcing material and f a mold release agent. When used in an SMC as defined above, the isocyanate terminated urethane prepolymer additive of the present invention, the prepolymer may be dissolved in styrene and then used like any other low shrink additive, and is employed in an amount sufficient to react with at least 10 percent but not more than 105 percent of the hydroxyl groups present in the reaction. The metallic oxide or hydroxide used in the dual thickening system is essentially a metal oxide or hydroxide from the Group IIA on the periodic table and comprises calcium or magnesium. Although calcium may be used in its various oxides and hydroxides, the magnesium is preferred inasmuch as superior results are achieved by the use of magnesium. Although the present invention may be used alone, it may also be used with a monomer from the group styrene, vinyl toluene and vinyl acetate and any other ethylenically unsaturated monomer and when so used, is ordinarily present in an amount to give .5 to 2.5 moles of monomer unsaturation per mole of unsaturation in the unsaturated polyester resin. Styrene and vinyl toluene are preferred monomers, although others may be used. A free radical polymerization catalyst is also employed in the present invention. The catalyst is preferably present in an amount of .1 part per 100 parts of total resin and monomer, the parts being measured by weight. The free radical polymerization catalyst is added to the uncured composition so that upon heating to the activation temperature, the additive type cross linking polarization reaction will commence between the polymerizable monomer and the unsaturated polyester resin to form the matrix previously described. The catalyst is usually employed in an amount in the range of 0.1 to 3.0 parts per 100 parts of the total monomer and resin and is usually a peroxide. The mold release agent contemplated in the present invention may be any of those used in the prior art, such as zinc stearate, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, organic phosphate esters and other organic liquid internal mold release agents. The reinforcing fibers are usually present in an amount of 10 to 70 weight percent for sheet molding compositions and is preferably fiberglass. The preferred range for this reinforcing fiber is 15 to 70 weight percent for use in thermoset polyester resin applications, such as an SMC. Any number of nonreinforcing fillers may be added to the composition to reduce overall material costs without sacrificing a significant degree of the desirable physical properties in the final product, or may be added to impart specific properties to the uncured compound. Any number of fillers may be used in an amount ranging from 20 parts to 1000 parts by weight per 100 parts of the pure polyester resin in thermoset polyester resin applications, such as an SMC. In addition, the invention may, as previously stated, include a low shrink additive polymer, which is ordinarily dissolved in the same type of ethylinically unsaturated monomer in which the polyester resin is dissolved. In use of the dual functional additive of the present invention with thermoset polyester resin products as defined in Epel et al, and especially sheet molding compositions SMC , the unsaturated polyester resin as described in US A 4 067 845 is dissolved in a monomer such as styrene, vinyl acetate or vinyl toluene. The dual thickening system of US A 4 067 845 is modified by the replacement of the organic polyisocyanate defined therein with the dual functional additive of the present invention. A free radical catalyst, which is activated by heat such as organoperoxides, hydroperoxides or azo compounds, and usually a peroxide, is added to the polyester resin material. Inert fillers may be added to reduce the overall cost of the SMC while not appreciably sacrificing the essential properties of the SMC. The modified dual thickening system is then added to the polyester resin, along with an additional amount of the isocyanate terminated urethane prepolymer of the present invention in an amount such that the total amount of prepolymer to polyester resin is within the range of 10 parts by weight of prepolymer to 90 parts by weight of polyester resin material to 60 parts by weight of prepolymer to 40 parts by weight of polyester resin. Reinforcing fibers, such as fiberglass, are added to the SMC in a conventional manner. Once the fibers have been thoroughly admixed with the composition, the SMC is B staged to a moldable consistency by aging at 32.2 to 40.0 C 90 to 104 F for 3 to 5 days. After the material has been B staged, it can be molded at 137.9 to 157.3 C 280 to 315 F in 1 to 2 minutes, depending on the specific configuration, i.e. thickness, of the part being molded. After B staging has occurred, the SMC may be stored for long periods of time without jeopardizing either its handleability or processability. Finally, by virtue of being covalently bonded to the polyester resin matrix of the SMC, the new additive imparts superior temperature retention properties to the SMC infrastructure which are not achievable, insofar as is known, with any of the known prior art. The use of the dual functional additive of the present invention in the manner described above creates an SMC which exhibits superior viscosity index, as well as improved dynamic impact properties, high temperature retention properties, and pigmentability over any in the known prior art. Examples A through F are given to show the method for preparing the prepolymer from either a polyether or a polyester base. The polyol, either a polyether polyol or a polyester polyol, is dissolved in styrene until a clear, homogenous solution is obtained. The isocyanate is in a reaction kettle and the polyol solution is added to it at the rate of 1.67 percent by weight per minute. During the addition of the polyol, the reactants are maintained at a temperature of approximately 37,8 C 100 F . After the addition of the polyol, a catalyst is added to the reaction mass and the reactants are allowed to exotherm for 30 minutes. After the reaction temperature stabilizes, usually within 30 minutes of exotherm, the composition is heated to 68.4 C 155 F and maintained at that temperature for an additional 30 minutes. The completion of the reaction is monitored by measuring the free isocyanate content of the reaction product. The following examples A to F are also given to show the prepolymer formed when using either a polyether according to the present invention or a polyester polyol comparative Polyether polyol EW 1000 Polyester polyol EW 1000 Polyether polyol EW 1000 Polyether polyol EW 1000 Polyester polyol EW 1000 Polyether polyol EW 500 These Examples are provided to show the improvements in shrinkage and moldability which are obtained using the prepolymer blend of the present invention in a matrix for a sheet molding composition. Comparative Working Example 1, containing no prepolymer and no isocyanate, serves as the control, whereas working Example 1 depicts the results when using a polyether based isocyanate terminated urethane prepolymer, and Comparative Working Example 2 serves to depict the results when using an isocyanate terminated urethane prepolymer based on a polyester polyol. The advantages expected when using a prepolymer according to the present invention include improved shrinkage properties as well as moldability over the control paste blend. In each of the cited examples, the Σ value is defined as where η is the moldability of the paste at the respective temperature. These Examples are provided to depict the effect of various specific ratios of isocyanate to hydroxyl groups in polyester and or polyester resin systems in a matrix or a sheet molding composition as it relates to shrinkage characteristics and moldability. Comparative Working Example 3 acts as the control, having no isocyanate terminated urethane prepolymer present and a polyester resin based upon polymethyl methacrylate and styrene and having similar properties as Comparative Working Example 1, namely, poor shrinkage properties and poor moldability. Working Example 2 depicts the effects of the isocyante terminated urethane prepolymer product of Example C having a styrene blend and an NCO OH ratio of 5 1 on a polyester resin product. The prepolymer according to Working Example 2 shows a slightly higher shrinkage than the control of Comparative Working Example 3, but still within normally acceptable parameters. Further, Working Example 2 depicts an improved moldability relative to the control of Comparative Working Example 3. Working Example 3 depicts the effect of an isocyanate terminated urethane prepolymer based on a polyether polyol formed from a styrene blend having an NCO OH ratio of 1.5 l. The example is provided to show the effect of different ratios of NCO OH relative to shrinkage and moldability, which in this example are much improved over the control of Comparative Working Example 3. Comparative Working Example 4 is provided to show the results to be expected relative to shrinkage and moldability when using an isocyanate terminated urethane prepolymer based on a polyester polyol in a styrene blend which forms the polyester resin of the Example. As seen in Comparative Working Example 4, an NCO OH of 1.5 l is used in the polyester based prepolymer. These Examples are provided to depict the shrinkage characteristics of the prepolymer of the present invention contrasting the shrinkages observed when using a polyether polyol having the equivalent weight E.W. of 1000 and 500, which corresponds to the polyols commonly known as BASF Pz010 and BASF P1010, respectively. In both examples, the NCO OH is 2 1, which is within the preferred ranges of the present invention. These Examples are provided to contrast the dynamic impact characteristics of conventional prior art SMCs with the SMC formed by the present invention.
