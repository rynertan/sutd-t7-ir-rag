# APPARATUS INCLUDING ELECTRICAL CONTACTS

## Abstract
This invention relates to apparatus including mating electrical contacts at least one of which comprises a substrate and a contact layer in intimate contact with the said substrate. The contact layer includes a crystallographic phase produced by in situ reaction using energies associated with conventional ambient and involving a reactant present in a substrate together with one introduced externally. The resulting layered chemical compound is a suitable replace ment for electroplated gold and serves in make break switches, connectors, sustained contact elements, etc.
