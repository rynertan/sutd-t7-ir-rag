DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION 1. Critical Service Properties The metal thermoplastic metal laminates of the present invention are constructed of a thermoplastic core layer and two metal layers, one laminated on each side of the thermoplastic core layer. The laminates are characterized by a combination of critical service properties high heat distortion temperature, low coefficient of linear thermal expansion, low inelastic ratio good elasticity in flexure , and lightness in weight as well as certain other desirable properties, which make them excellent for use as construction panels. The high heat distortion temperature of the laminates HDTz within the scope of this invention is a unique property and must be greater than about 130 C. 266 F. to survive various conditions encountered in use. It is particularly important in applications requiring good dimensional stability under engineering loads and wherein the laminates may be subjected to elevated temperature conditions. For example, when the laminates are employed as construction panels for automotive applications, they are subjected to elevated temperature conditions extant in paint curing ovens at least about 135 C. 275 F. .In such an instance, a HDT of at least about 1350C. is necessary with about 16SC. 325 F. being preferred in order to provide adequate dimensipnal stability at even higher t,empe,rature extant in many paint curing ovens.It will be appaFent of course that the laminates must be able to withstand exposure to such elevated temperature conditions extant in paint curing ovens without buckling, warping, flattening out if already formed into a shaped structure , and the like. Heat distortion temperature, also known as deflection temperature under flexural load, is measured according to a specific modification ofASTM D 648 72 test method for plastics. In this modification, the sheet specimen width, b, is about 2.22 cm 0.875 inch , the length is about 7.62 cm 3 inches , the span between the supports is 5.08 cm 2 inches , and the maximum stress in the specimen is 1.82 x 106 N m2 264 psi Surprisingly and unexpectedly, the heat distorsion temperature of the laminates HDTg within the scope of the present invention optimally can approach essentially that of the crystalline melting point of the thermoplastic core material Tm . As a result, the heat c distortion temperature of the laminates may exceed that of the thermoplastic core material by several hundred degrees.For example, a laminate EXM1PLE 3 comprising two 0.0127 cm 0.005 inch, 5 mils thick 1100 0 aluminum layers and a 0.295 cm 0.116 inch, 116 mils thick nylon 6,6 core layer interposed therebetween and laminated thereto had a heat distortion temperature of 228 C. 4420 F. compared to C only 77 C. 171 F. for the nylon 6,6 layer alone. Excellent dimensional stability under engineering stresses at elevated temperature is, therefore, a prime characteristic of the laminate, particularly when compared with the thermoplastic core materials alone. The crystalline melting points of thermoplastics tic is determined by differential scanning calorimetry DSC using a heating rate of 10 C. per minute. The values for crystalline melting point are taken as either the temperature at which the apparent melting rate was maximum, or the temperature at which essentially the last traces of melting are detected, the latter being preferred in instances wl cre the difference between the two is substantial, for example, greater than 10 C. The marked increase in heat distortion temperature shown by the metal thermoplastic metal laminats over that of the thermoplastic core layer alone clearly illustrates the advantages of the present invention. Comparison of the heat distortion temperatures shown by laminates within the scope of the present invention with those shown by similar laminates having an amorphous thermoplastic core layer demonstrates that such laminates those having an amorphous thermoplastic core layer fail to show the same or similar marked increase shown by laminates of the present invention.For example, a laminate EXANSLE 69 comprising two 0.0127 cm 0.005 inch, 5 mils thick 1100 0 aluminum layers and d 0.208 cm 0.082 inch, 82 mils thick PARN 56 44 nylon 56 6, terephthalic acid co 44 6, isophthalic acid layer having a degree of crystallinity of 35 that is, partly crystalline interposed therebetween and laminated thereto had a heat distortion temperature of 207 C. 405 F. compared to only 1170 C. 243 F. for the PARN 56 44 alone, O O an increase of 90 C. 162 F. .On the other hand, a similar laminate EXAb,FLE 70 comprising two 0.0127 cm 0.005 inch, 5 mils thick 1100 0 aluminum layers and 0.178 cm 0.070 inch, 70 mils thick amorphous PARN 56 44 as the thermoplastic core layer had a heat distortion temperature of only 1220 C. 252 F. as compared to 1170 C. 2430 F. for the PARN 56 44 alone, an increase of only 5 C. 9 F. . Low coefficient of linear thermal expansion in the plane of the laminate CLTEg less than about 63 x 10 60 cm cm 0C. 0C.1 35 x 60F. is another critical property of the metal thermoplastic metal laminates of the present invention because in the construction applications contemplated, changes in part sizes due to temperature variations must be minimal in order to lessen the possibility of unsightly bulges and gaps between metal and concrete components and parts made with the laminates of this invention. The coefficient of linear thermal expansion is measured according to ASTM D696 70 test method for plasticsIt can also be determined by measuring the distance between two finely scribed parallel lines on the surface of the specimen with a calibrated traveling microscope or cathetometer. The specimen is contained in a rectangular hole in a heavy copper block which can be thermostatically controlled at various, widely separated temperatures. The rectangular hole in the copper block is only slightly larger than the cross section of the specimen, and the scribed lines on the surface of the specimens are visible through a narrow slit machined into the copper block. While certain plastic materials are light weight and have high energy absorption capability high impact strength , making them desirable for use as construction panels, they suffer from the dsadv tage that their coefficients of linear thermal expansion are 4 to 5 and even 10 times that of most metallic and vitreous construction materials, for example, aluminum, steel, and concrete.Their use for construction panels on metal or concrete structural frames often are precluded by the high differential thermal expansivity which leads to problems of fastening, and, in addition, by the unsightly gaps which would result between panels at low temperatures and or the buckling of panels at high temperatures. The normal procedure for lowering the coefficient of linear thermal expansion of plastics is to incorporate glass fibers. Usually, 30 to 40 weight percent of glass is sufficient to reduce the coefficient of linear thermal expansion of a plastic to about that of aluminum about 23.4 x 10 6 C 1 . This, however, usually results in a strong but brittle material having very low elongation to break. That is, the composite cracks at very low impact regardless of whether the plastic per se is a strong but brittle resin, such as a thermoset polyester, o a tough polymer with high extensibility with high elongation to break, such as nylon 6,6. It will be noted, however, that the decreased multiaxial impact resistance of glass filled plastics does not preclude the use of glass fibers in the thermoplastic core layer materials of the present invention in that lamination of suitable metal layers thereon as described hereinbelow tends to offset at least in part the undesirable properties of the glass filled thermoplastics. Metals, of course, do not suffer the disadvantage of high coefficients of linear thermal expansion as do plastics. However, they generally are not lightweight, particularly at thicknesses sufficient for use as construction panels. Also, their elastic recovery from bending and denting generally is very poor. Thus, the metal thermoplastic metal laminates of the present invention provide the best of both worlds. That is to say, they are not only lightweight, but in addition, are characterized by a combination of high heat distortion temperatures, low inelastic ratios good flexural elasticities , and low coefficients of linear thermal expansion.The coefficient of linear thermal expansion must be less than about 63 x 10 6 C. 1. However, in certain applications requiring low thermal expansivity such as in the case of an automobile panel, the CLTEg preferably is less than about 54 x 106 C. 1 and more preferably less than 45 x 10 6 C. 1.The low CLTE values obtainable by the laminates of this invention less than 63 x 10 C. 1 , although somewhat greater than those of steel about 15.3 x 10 6OC. 1 and aluminum about 23.4 x 10 6 C. 1 , are sufficiently low for demanding construction applications. An example of the low coefficient of linear thermal expansion exhibited by laminates of the present invention is as follows. A laminate EXAMPLE 5 comprised of two 0.0127 cm 0.005 inch, 5 mils thick 1100 0 aluminum layers laminated on either side of a 0.180 cm 0.071 inch, 71 mils thick nylon 6,6 layer had a coefficient of linear thermal expansion of 29.0 x 10 6 C. 1 compared to 23.6 x 10 6OC. 1 for the aluminum alone and the relatively high value of 110.2 x 10 6OC. 1 for the nylon 6,6 alone. Low inelastic ratio IRg good flexural elasticity less than about 93 is a critical property of the metal thermoplastic metal laminates.The inelastic ratio characterizes the elastic recovery of such laminate panels after being subjected to deflection sufficient to produce a substantial strain for example, 5 in the outer metal layers at the point of maximum deflection. It is measured according to a specific modification of ASTM D 790 71.The method may be described as follows A sheet specimen with rectangular cross section of width b 1.27 cm 0.5 inch , a thickness or depth d in cm inches , and a length 1 L s where L is the span of the flexural test in cm inches and 1.27 cm 0.5 inch , is set horizontally into a three point flexural test fixture i.e., with the 1.27 cm 0.5 inch width horizontal and the depth d vertical and deflected vertically at a crosshead de flection rate D of 0.0212 cm s 0.5 inch minute to a deflection Do in cm inches such that the strain r in the central portion of the outer skin of the specimen is, except where noted otherwise, 5 , as computed in 2 percent by the formula r 600dD0 L .The span L used is approximately 16 times the depth d, except for thicknesses or depths d 0.172 cm 0.065 inches , whereupon the span used is 2.54 cm 00 inch . After bending the specimen to the specified deflection Doa the flexural loading is immediately removed at a crosshead deflection rate of 0.846 cm s 20 inches minute . Then the specimen is immediately removed from the flexural test fixture, set on its edge on a flat surface and allowed to freely relax. Periodically, the specimen is placed in a fixture with the same span and configuration used in bending it, and its residual deflection Dr measured with a dial gauge.When the residual deflection Dr has reached its limiting, equilibrium value, Dr DR, the inelastic ratio is computed according to the formula IR 100 DR DO , in percent. The limiting, equilibrium value DR is attained usually within a period of one to two days, but always within one week. As noted hereinabove, the inelastic ratio irk is a critical and important characterization of the elastic recovery of laminate panels after they have been deflected sufficiently to produce substantial strain in their outer surfaces. If IRg is too high low elasticity , both the degree of recovery of the laminates to their original shape after being strained substantially and the ability of the laminates to recover totally their original shape after being deflected in use to some lesser degree of strain will be inadequate under demanding use conditions.And, since one of the principal objects of the present invention is the provision of a metal thermoplasticmetal laminate having an improved combination of service properties considered important for demanding construction applications, an important limitation of the present invention is the upper limit on iR. In general, materials having an inelastic ratio greater than 93 are too inelastic and or too weak to be employed as construction panels under conditions demanding or requiring any elasticity ormore specifically, elastic recovery at all. The upper limit for the inelastic ratio of the laminates within the scope of the present invention as noted hereinabove, is therefore about 938. Moreover, laminates having inelastic ratios in the following ranges, determined at 5 strain in the outer metal layers at the point of maximum deflection as described hereinabove, are rated as follows INELASTIC RATIOS, IR RATING 938 very poor 84 938 marginal 75 84 fair 30 75 good 308 excellent Since both the degree of recovery of the laminate to its original shape after being strained substantially and the ability of the laminate to totally recover without experiencing any permanent dents and creases after being strained to a small degree increase as the inelastic ratio decreases, the lower the inelastic ratio becomes the more desirable the laminate becomes for demanding construction applications. Thus, laminates having inelastic ratios within the good and excellent ranges 75 are preferred. It will be recognized, of course, that while IR as employed herein is determined except where noted otherwise at a strain r of 5 , other strain values, either lower or higher, can be emploed. However, IR values determined at strain values other than 5 generally will differ from those determined at 5 . For example, an IR value determined at a strain less than 5 such as 1.5 will in general be lower than that determined at 5 . Conversely, anIR value determined at a strain greater than 5 such as 8 generally will be higher than that determined at 5 . It will be noted that the inelastic ratio for the laminates within the scope of the present invention, surprisingly, is always lower than that for the metal layer materials alone which have an inelastic ratio irk upper limit of about 95 for very soft 1145 0 aluminum . As an example, a laminate EXAMPLE 5 comprised of two 0.0127 cm 0.005 inch, 5 mils thick 1100 0 aluminum layers and a 0.180 cm 0.071 inch, 71 mils thick layer of nylon 6,6 interposed therebetween and having good adhesion thereto had an inelastic ratio of only 27 compared to the very high inelastic ratio of 94 obtained for sheets of 1100 0 aluminum alone.Good elasticity low and and consequently good dent recovery, is therefore a prime characteristic of the laminates of the present invention, particularly when compared to a conventional construction sheeting or panels made of metal alone. Lightness in weight of the laminate of the present invention is of particular interest because it results in a substantial weight savings in the total weight of a constructed object. For example, if the constructed object is an automobile, the weight savings should result in an increase in fuel economy for the particular automobile. It will be recognized, of course, that the total weight savings realized will depend upon the materials comprising the laminate, the total amount of the laminate employed, and the materials for which the laminate is being substituted.It will be apparent that when steel is employed as the laminate s metal layers, weight saving over steel itself for example, 0.0813 cm 0.032 in., 32 mils thich steel the most common type and thickness of automotive body panel material will not be as great as when comparably dimensioned laminates having aluminum metal layers are employed. The weight reduction for laminates having steel layers is nevertheless substantial.For example, when a laminate EXAMPLE 25 is prepared from two 0.00254 cm 0.001 inch, 1 mil thick steel layers and 0.182 cm 0.0715 inch, 71.5 mils nylon 6,6, its weight per unit area is only 38.5 2.44 kg m2, 0.500 lb. ft. of the 6.34 kg m2 1.3 lb. ft.2 weight of a 0.0813 cm 0.032 in. thick steel sheet. For certain construction applications demanding very high strength and stiffness such as in portions of some automotive vehicle bodies and in some building surfaces, steel sheeting weighing as much as about 9.76 kg m2 2 1b. ft.2 is used. Thus, the maximum weight of the laminates within the scope of the present invention, is about 9.76 kg m2, with values substantially below this weight being preferred. Values less than 6.34 N m2 1.3 1b. ft.2 , however, are most preferred, particularly for automobile applications. While each of the critical properties high heat distortion temperature greater than about 1300C. 2660F. , low coefficient of linear thermal expansion less than about 63 x 10 6 C. 1 , low inelastic ratio less than about 93 , and lightness in weight no more than about 9.76 kg m2 is highly desirable, either taken alone is not sufficient. They must exist in combination.That is to say, in order to be broadly suitable for a wide variety and range of high performance construction applications, the metal thermoplastic metal laminates must have in combination a heat distortion temperature HDT greater than about 1300C 266 F. , a coefficient of linear thermal expansion CLTEl less than about 63 x 10 6a 1, an inelastic ratio irk less than about 93 , and a maximum weight of no more than about 9.76 kg m2.2. Correlation of Critical Service Properties and Thickness Ratio The critical and important service properties of the laminates of this invention IRQ, CLTEl, and HDTQ are related to the ratio of the thicknesses of the component layers of the laminates via the product of the thickness ratio of the sum of the metal layer ,thicknesses to the thermoplastic core layer thickness times the ratio of the strengths of the component layers of the laminate, or in mathematical symbols, via the following dimensionless parameter TR YSm TSc wherein TR is the thickness ratio of the sum of the metal layer thicknesses to the thermo plastic core thickness YS is the thickness weight average tensile m yield strength of the two metal layers that is, the sum of the products of the thickness of each metal layer times its tensile yield strnegth at an offset of 5 elongation divided by the sum of the metal layers thicknesses, or in mathematical symbols, tiySi tiiysii Tm wherein ti, tii, ysi, and ysii are as defined herein below and Tm is the sum of the metal layers thicknesses or ti tii and TS c is the tensile strength of the thermoplastic core material. The tensile yield strength at an offset of 5 elongation for the metal layers ys is determined substantially in accordance with ASTM D638 72, entitled, Standard Method of Test for Tensile Properties of Plastics . Type I specimens are employed and the speed of testing is 5.0 mm per minute. The metal test specimens herein were pre o conditioned at 23 C. at 50 relative humidity for at least 18 hours and testing was conducted at 230 C. and 50 relative humidity. The value for ys is that of the metal after being subjected to the thermal conditions of lamination. In many cases this value for ys will not be substantially different from that of the metal before lamination since for many metals no significant change in ys occurs under typical lamination thermal conditions.In those cases where the value for ys must be determined on the metal after having been subjected to the thermal conditions of lamination, the al d e separated from the core of the laminate for such a determination for example, the thermoplastic core cc d be dissolved and the metal layers isolated for such determination. It is recognized that some metal layers may experience break before a strain of 5 offset. For, such metals the maximum tensile strength for the material is tobe used as the value for ys. The tensile strength of the thermoplastic core material TSc is also determined substantially in accordance with ASTM D638 72. Type I test specimens are employed and the speed of testing is 5.0 mm per minute. Specimens were pre conditioned at 23 C. for at least 18 hours. All nonlaminated polyamide specimens were kept dry, as molded in sealed cans with anhydrous magnesium perchlorate or anhydrous calcium sulfate desiccants during the preconditioning period and all other specimens were pre conditioned at 50 relative humidity.The tensile strength of the thermoplastic materials is taken as the tensile stress at yield or in the absence of a yield point, the tensile stress at fail break. The value of TS is of the rorp thermal conditions C after subjection to lamination which in general will be the same as the thermoplastic material before lamination. In instances where the thermoplastic is such that significant changes inTSc would likely occur during lamination, the value of TSc can be determined, for example, by subjecting a representative sample of the thermoplastic material alone to the lamination thermal conditions and taking a measurement on the resultant material. The thickness ratio TR is described by the region of numerical overlap of the parameter TR YSm TSC as determined from the areas defined by the relationships of TR YSm TSc toIRl FIG. 1 , CLTEl FIG. 2 , and HDTl HDTc Tmc HDTc FIG. 3 . The lower boundary of such areas is defined by the equation for a straight line y jrnx b in which y is the y axis vertical axis parameters of IRg, CLTEg, and HDTQ HDTc Tmc HDTc , x is the x axis horizontal axis parameter of TR YSm TSc , m is the slope of the straight line, and b is the intercept on the y axis. When y is IRl, m is 108 and b is zero 0 for values of x from zero 0 to 0.65, and m is zero iO and b is 70 for values of x greater than 0.65. then y is CLTEl, m is 3.6 x 10 4 4 and b is 45 x 1O 6 for values of x from zero 0 to 0.1, and m is zero 0 and b is 9 x 10 6 for values of x greater than b.1. When y is HDT HDTc Tmc HDTC , m is 1 and b is zero 0 for values of x from zero 0 to 0.05, m is 10 and b is 0.45 for values of x from 0.05 to 0.12, and m is zero O and b is 0.75 for values of x greater than 0.12. The upper boundary of the areas defined by the relationships of TR YSm TSc to IRQ FIG. 1 , CLTEl FIG. 2 , and HDTl HDTc Tmc HDTc FIG. 3 is also defined by the equation for a straight line defined hereinabove for.the lower boundary of such areas. When y is IRQ, m is 280 and b is 30 for values of x from zero 0 to 0.25, and m is zero O and b is 100 for values of x greater than 0.25. When y is CLTEl, m is 2.88 x 10 3 3 and b is 216 x 10 6 for values of x from zero 0 to 0.05, m is 1.29 x 10 4 and b is 78.5 x 10 6 for values of x from 0.05 to 0.26, and m is zero 0 and b is 45 x 10 6 for values of x greater than 0.26. When y is HDTz HDTC Tm HDTc , m is 112.5 and b is zero 0 for values of x from zero 0 to 0.004, m is 15.3 and b is 0.389 for values of x from 0.004 to 0.04, and m is zero 0 and b is 1 for values of x greater than 0.04. Referring to FIG. 1, it is readily seen that all of the data falls within a band defined at its outer limits by curves 1 and 2, which are, respectively, the upper and lower boundaries of the area defined by the relationship ofTR YSm TSc to IRl. Thus, where it is desirable to have a laminate possessing a specified inelastic ratio, IRg less than the maximum value of 93 noted hereinabove , the thickness ratio of the laminate is readily determined by drawing a horizontal line rom the desired IRg value to the point of intersection at curve 1 and curve 2, where possible , which lue s can be read from the TR YSm TSC axis. The point of intersection at curve 1 Cat IRg greater than about 30 will establish a minimum value for the dimensionless parameter.TR itself can then be readily determined by substituting easily determined and or known values of YS and TS for chosen metal c and thermoplastic core layers in the dimensionless parameter. If the same horizontal line drawn to intersect curve 1 also intersects curve 2, then an upper limit for TR YSm TSc as well as TR alone can also be determined in the same manner as described for the lower limits. In such an instance, a range of values for TR YSm TSC and hence TR will be established. On the other band, where the horizontal line drawn to intersect curve 1 does not also intersect curve 2, then, consistent with the thickness and weight limitations discussed hereinabove, there is no upper limit for TR YSm TSc . Referring to FIG. 2, it is readily seen that all of the data also falls within a band defined at its outer limits by curves 3 and 4, the upper and lower boundaries, respectively, of the area defined by the relationship of TR YSm TSc to CLTE In a manner similar to that described for FIG. 1, once a desired CLTEg less than 63 x 10 6 C. 1 is specified, the value or values for TR YSm TSc and hence TR itself can be readily determined. Referring to FIG. 3, again it is readily seen that all of the data falls within a band defined at its outer limits by curves 5 and 6, which are the upper and lower boundaries, respectively, of the area defined by the relationship of TR YSm TSc to HDTl HDTC tTm HDTC . Once a desired value for .HDT greater han the minimum value of about 130 C. 266 F. is specified, known values of HDTc and Tm for chosen thermoplastics can be substituted in theC normalized HDT variable, HDTl HDTc Tmc HDTc to obtain a value between zero 0.0 and 1.0. Once that value is determined, the TR YSm TSc value or value can be determined as described for FIGs. 1 and 2 by drawing a horizontal line from the desired HDTQ HDTc Tm HDTc value to the point of intersection at curve 9 and curve 6, where possible . Thus the optimum and preferred TR range for any given laminate having a specified balance of IR , CLTEl, and HDT can be readily ascertained by correlating the TR YSm TScJ values obtained fromFIGs. 1, 2 and 3 and determining the region of numerical overlap of such values. In general, since the combination of low IRg , low CLTEl, and high HDT is preferred, a TR YSm TSc within the range between about 0.08 and 0.6 is preferred, although as indicated by FIGs. 1, 2 and 3, other values are also suitable. It will be noted, however, that regardless of the TR value, the minimum thickness of each metal layer must be at least about 0.00127 cm 0.0005 inch 0.5 mils and the maximum weight of the laminate must be no more than about 9.76 kg m2 2 lb. ft. 2 More over, as a practical matter, TR must be greater than zero 0 thermoplastic alone and less than absolute infinity metal alone in that the metal thermoplasticmetal laminates within the scope of the present invention cannot be comprised of either metal or thermoplastic alone. Once TR is determined, if a thickness is chosen for either the metal layers or the thermoplastic core layer, the thickness for the remaining component layer is readily determined. It will be noted, however, that in the specific instance wherein the metal layers have different compositions that is, ysi and ysii, as defined hereinbelow, are not equal, the relative thicknesses of the metal layers must be specified in order to determine the value ofYSm which in turn is required in order to calculateTR from the TR YSm TSc relationship as illustrated hereinbelow. Of course, once TR is determined and since T from t. t.. where t. and t.. are the m 1 11 1 11 thicknesses of the respective metal layers arbitrarily labeled as i and ii is known,the required thermoplastic core layer thickness is readily determined. The manner by which FIGs. 1, 2, and 3 described hereinabove are employed to establish values for TR YSm TSC and hence TR alone is to choose values for the properties IR CLTE and HDTl commensurate with the intended end use. For example, if the end use application would require an IRg of 33 , then a value for TR YSm TSC renging from about 0.010 to about 0.31 would be indicated by FIG. 1. If the end use application would also require a CLTEg of 24.3 x 10 6 C. 1, then a TR YSm TSC value ranging from about 0.057 to approximately infinity or simply a value of at least about 0.057 would be indicated byFIG. 2.And, if a HDTl of 218 C. would be required for the contemplated end use, choosing nylon 6 HDTC 65 C. Tm 2200C. as the thermoplastic core layer for iliustrative purposes, the normalized variable HDTl HDTc Tm HDTc can be readily solved 218 C c 65 C. 220 C. 650C. to give a value of 0.99. This normalizedHDT variable value would require, according to FIG. 3, a TR YSm TSc value ranging from about 0.039 to approximately infinity or again, simply a value of at least about 0.039 . The optimum TR YSm TSc values for a laminate having an IRQ of 33 , a CLTEl of 24.3 x 10 6 C. 1, a HDTl of 218 C., and nylon 6 as the thermoplastic core layer would be the region of numerical overlap, namely, between 0.057 and 0.31. The optimum values for TR itself can be readily determined once the metal layers for example, aluminum and more particularly the specific composition type and thickness of aluminum are specified.Since TR YSm TSc 0.057 to 0.31 then TR 0.057 TSc YSm to 0.31 TSc YSm If, for illustrative purposes, 1100 0 aluminum ti tii 0.0127 cm 0.000127 m, 0.005 inch 5 mils ysi Ysii 58.25 x 10 NIm 8.45 x lb. in. at an offset of 5 elongation YSm tiysi tiiysii Tm 0.000127 m x 58.25 x 106 N m2 0.000127 m x 58.25 x 106 N m2 0 00054 106 N m2 the t l 0.000254 58.25 x 106 N m2 is chosen as the metal layers and nylon 6 TSC 75.14 x 106 N m2 10.9 x 103 1b. in.2 as noted hereinabove, is chosen as the thermoplastic core layer, then 2 TR 0.057 75.14 x 106 N m2 0.057 x 1.29 58.25 x 106 N m2 0.074 and 6 2 TR 0.31 75.14 x 106 N m2 0.31 x 1.29 0.40 58.25 x 106 N m2 Thus TR should range between about 0.074 and 0.40 for the above specified balance of IRl, CLTEl, and EIDTQ values for a laminate comprised of equally thick sheets of 1100 0 aluminum as the metal layers and nylon 6 as the thermoplastic core layer.An experimental laminate possessing the above specified combination of properties with TR having the value of 0.151 is described in EXAMPLE 67. In similar manner, if an end use application for a laminate comprised of equally thick sheets of 1100 0 aluminum YSm 58.25 x 10 N m2 as the metal layers and poly ethylene terephthalate HDTc 890C. Tm 2520 C. TSc 77.21 x 106 N m2 as the thermoplastic core layer would require an IRg w 50 .l, a CLTF of 29.5 x 10 6 C 1 and a HDT of 240 C., the region of overlap for TR YSm TSc values as determined from FIGs. 1, 2 and 3 would indicate an optimum range between about 0.042 and 0.285, and hence a TR range between about 0.056 and 0.38. An experirental example of such a laminate with a TR value of 0t165 is EXAMPLE 71. it will be noted that since the laminates of this invention have two metal layers, one on each side of the thermoplastic core layer, the metal layers can have either the same or different compositions as long as the combination of critical service properties are met Metal layers having different thicknesses also may be employed so long as such thicknesses come within the limits established by the metal layers minimum thickness requirement and the maximum weight requirement of the resultant laminate, and the combination of critical and important service properties are met. When metal layers having different compositions and or thicknesses are employed, it is preferred that certain important characteristics of the metal layers be substantially balanced in order to avoid problems such as warping, buckling, and the like when such laminates are exposed to variations in temperature. The important characteristics of the metal layers should be balanced unsofar as practicable such that a CLTE. CLTE b tiEi tiiEii and c tiysi tiiysii wherein CLTEi and CLTEii, ti and tii, Ei and Eii, and ys and Ysii are, respectively, the coefficients of linear thermal expansion, thicknesses, elastic moduli, and tensile yield strengths of the respective metal layers arbitrarily labeled as i and ii .However, as a practical matter, generally it is preferred that both metal layers be of the same composition and thickness. As an example wherein metal layers having different compositions and different thicknesses are employed 0.00508 cm 0.0000508 m, 0.002 inch, 2 mils thick 304 stainless steel annealed and 0.0152 cm 0.000152 m, 0.006 inch, 6 mils 0.0152 centimeter thick 6061 0 aluminum, arbitrarily labeled as t. and tii, respectively, for example and wherein, for illustrative purposes, nylon 6,6 is employed as the thermoplastic core layer, if the end use application would require an IRz of 45 , then a value for TR YSm TSC ranging from about 0.051 to about 0.42 would be indicated by FIG. 1.If the end use application would also require aCLTE of 32.8 x 10 6 0C. 1, then aTR YSm TSc value ranging from about 0.034 to approximately infinity or simply a value of at least about 0.034 would be indicated by FIG. 2. And, if a HDT of 250 C. or higher would be required for the contemplated end use, using nylon 6.6 HDTC 770 C. Tm 263 C. , as noted hereinabove, as the thermoflastic core layer, the normalized HDT variable can be readily solved 250 C. 77 C. 2630 C. 770 C. to give a value of 0.93.This normalized HDT variable value would require, according to FIG. 3, a value ranging from about 0.035 to approximately infinity or again, simply a value of at least about 0.035 . The optimum values for TR YSm TSc for a laminate having an IR of 45 , a CLTE 6f 32.8 x 10 C. 1, and an HDT alpha of 250 C. 482 F. would be between 0.051 and 0.42, the region of numerical overlap for FIGs. 1, 2 and 3. The optimum values for TR itself can be readily determined since, as noted hereinabove, 304 stainless steel annealed ti 0.0000508 m ys 369.52 x 106 N m2 53.6 x 103 lb. in.2 at an offset of 5 elongation and 6061 0 aluminum tii 0.000152 m ysii 112.37 x 106 N m2 16.3 x 103 1b. in.2 at an offset of 5 elongation are employed as the metal layers.Since TR YSm TSc 0.051 to 0.42 then TR 0.051 TSC YSm to 0.042 TSC YSm The strength values YSm and TSC are. as follows YSm tiysi tiiysii Tm 6 0.0000508 x 369.52 x 106 0.000152 x 112.37 x 106 0.0002028 18771.62 17080.24 0.0002028 35811.86 0.0002028 176.78 x 106 N m2 TSc 83.42 x 106 N m2Therefore, TR 0.051 83.42 x 106 N m2 0.051 x 0.47 176.78 x 10 N m 0.024 and TR 0.42 83.42 x 106 N m2g 0.42 x 0.47 176.78 x 1Ot N m 0.20 Thus, TR should range between about 0.024 and about 0.20 for the above specified balance ofIRl, CLTEl, and HDTl values for a laminate comprised of a 0.00508 cm thick sheet of 304 stainless steelannealed and a 0.0152 cm thick sheet of 6061 0 aluminum as the metal layers and nylon 6,6 as the thermoplastic core layer. An experimental example of such a laminate having a TR value of 0.0768, with IRg measured with steel on the tension side and with CLTE measured on the steel side is described in EXAMPLE 55. It will be noted that if IRg and CLTE were in turn measured from the aluminum side for the above described laminate, TR YSm TSc and TR would vary slightly from the above indicated values due to the lack of an absolute balance between CLTEi and CLTEii, tiEi and tiiEii, and tiysi and tiiysii. For example, IRg as measured with the 6061 0 aluminum on the tension side had a value of 43 O and CLTEg as measured from the aluminum side had a value of35.5 x 10 6 C. 1. HDTQ, however, remained unchanged in this instance.These values would require a range of TR YSm TSc values between about 0.045 and about 0.405, as indicated by FIG. , a value of at least about 0.026 as indicated by FIG.2, and a value of at least about 0.035 as indicated by FIG. 3, with the range between 0.045 and 0.405 FIG. 1 defining the region of numerical overlap.The value for TR alone would therefore be between about 0.021 and about 0.19, which range correlates quite well with the TR value of 0.0768 for the laminate described in EXAMPLE 55.3. Other Important Properties In addition to the above critical construction application properties, most of the laminates within the scope of the present invention also have excellent flexural stiffness, high flexural modulus, excellent formability at elevated temperatures, very good ductility, and high energy absorption ability. Excellent fleural stiffness and high effective flexural modulus a measure of unit flexural stiffness are highly desirable properties which the laminates preferably should possess. The desirability resides in the fact that the laminates must be sufficiently stiff so as to minimize the need for structural framing and or to minimize flexural deflection of the laminate panels from wind, marine hydraulic, and other loads. The ability of the laminates to resist wind and hydraulic pressures is particularly significant when they are used, for example as automotive vehicle body panels, boat body panels, and as outer panels in building construction. Flexural stiffness m is measured according to G specific version of ASTM D 790 71. The specific version can be described as follows A sheet specimen with a rectangular cross section of width b 1.27 cm 0.5 inch ,.a thickness or depth d in cm inches , and a length L where L is the span of the flexural test in cm inches and e 1.27 cm 0.5 inch , is set hori zontally into a three point flexural test fix ture Li.e., with the 1.27 cm 0.5 inch width horizontal and the depth d vertical and deflec ted vertically at a cross head rate D of 0.00212 cm s 0.05 inch minute .The applied load P in N lb. is recorded, as the deflection D in cm inches increases at the specified constant rate. For thicknesses or depths d 0.165 cm 0.065 inches , the span L is 2.54 cm 1.00 inch . Otherwise, the span is approximately 16 times the thickness or depth of the sheet specimen. The effective flexural modulus Eb in N m2 psi is computed from the formula EB L3me 4bd3, where me in N m lb. in. is the experimental slope of the initial, linear portion of the load versus deflection curve. The flexural strength S in N m2 psi is com puted from the formula S 3PL 2bd2 unless otherwise specified, this strength is computed as the stress at which the strain in outer skin of the central portion of the specimen is r 600dD L2 5 . The flexural stiffness ni is computed as m 4bd3EB L3 for the specific case of b 2.54 cm 1.00 inch and L 2.54 cm 1.00 inch . A flexural stiffness of about 52.53 x 103 N m 300 lb. in. is the lowest value that can be utilized for sheeting or panels in construction and building applications, even where framing is maximized and requirements on flexural deflection of the panels is minimal. This flexural stiffness is characteristic of 0.0508 cm 0.020 inch, 20 mils thick sheets of relatively weak and inelastic 5052 0 aluminum weighing 2 2 1.37 kg m 0.280 lb. ft. . This lowest useful flexural stiffness of about 52.53 x 10 N m, as well as even higher values of at least about 131.85 x 103 N m 753 lb. in. , is readily achieved with the laminates of the present invention.For example, as shown in the following table, a laminate EXAMPLE 23 comprised of two 0.0127 cm 0.005 inch, 5 mils thick layers of 5052 0 aluminum laminated on each side of a 0.0711 cm 0.028 inch, 28 mils thick layer of nylon 6,6 had a flexural stiffness of 161.44 x 103 N m 922 1b. in. an effective flexural modulus of 28.95 x 109 N m2 4.2 x 106 psi and a weight of 1.49 kg m2 00306 lb. ft.2 compared to a stiffness of 38.00 x 103 N m 217 1b. in. for a 0.133 cm 0.0523 inch, 52.3 mils thick sheet of nylon 6,6 alone weighing 1.51 kg m2 0.310 1b. ft.2 . Thus, the laminate gives much higher stiffness than an aluminum sheet of only slightly less weight per unit area and even higher stiffness relative to that of a much thicker sheet of nylon 6,6 alone having equivalent weight per unit area.

Taken from Lynch, Handbook of Materials of Science, Vol. II, CRC Press, Cleveland, 1975. As shown in the above table, a laminate EXAMPLE 38 comprised of two 0.0152 cm 0.006 inch, 6 mils thick 6061 T6 aluminum layers laminated to each side of a 0.122 cm 0.048 inch, 48 mils thick nylon 6,6 layer had a flexural stiffness of 606.72 x 103 N m 3465 lb. in. an effective flexural modulus of 27.64 x 10 NAm2 4.01 x 106 psi and a weight, of 2.21 kg m2 0.453 lb. ft.2 , compared to a a flexural stiffness of 443.00 x 103 N m 2530 lb. in. and a weight df 6.34 kg m2 1.3 lb. ft. 2 for 0.0813 cm 0.032 inch, 32 mils thick automobile body steel b a flexural stiffness of 226.93 x 103 N m 1296 lb. in. and a weight of 2.20 kg m2 0.451 lb. ft.2 for 0.0813 cm 0.032 inch, 32 mils thick 6061 T6 aluminum alone c a flexural stiffness of 434.25 x 103 N m 2480 1b. in. and a weight of 2.75 kg m2 0.564 1b. ft.2 for 0.102 cm 0.040 inch, 40 mils thick 6061 T6 aluminum alone and d a flexural stiffness of 117084 x 103 N m 673 lbO in. and a weight of 2.20 kg m2 0.451 lb. ft.2 for 0.194 cm 0.0762 inch, 76.2 mils thick sheet of nylon 6,6 alone. Thus, the lamiante is 37 stiffer in flexure and 65 lower in weight per unit area than the 0.0813 cm thick steel. The laminate is more than 2.5 times stiffer in flexure than the 606l T6 aluminum alone at equivalent weight per unit area and 37 stiffer than the 6061 T6 aluminum alone having a weight per unit area more than 20 higher than that of the laminate. And the laminate is more than five times stiffer than nylon 6,6 alone having substantially the same weight per unit area. It will be noted that in applications demanding relatively high flexural stiffness such as in automotive vehicle body panels and the like, a flexural stiffness of at least about 262.65 x 103 N m 1500 lb. in. is preferred, with values of at least about 437.75 x 103 N m t2500 lb. in. or higher being even more preferred. Excellent formability is a necessary property for the laminates if they are to be formed into shaped structures subsequent to preparation that is, subjected to post forming operations. The excellent formability and very good ductility of the metal thermoplastic metal laminates prepared from ductile metal layers and a ductile thermoplastic core layer ensure that such laminates can be formed into a variety of shapes from slightly curved to deep drawn without failure or rupture. The terms ductile and ductility as employed herein to describe the metal and thermoplastic core layer components and the laminates within the scope of the present invention refer to such materials having a tensile elongation at break or fail of at least 10 as measured by ASTN D 638 72 test method for plastics. The forming or, more accurately, post forming of the laminate can be readily accomplished by procedures Known to those skilled in the art One such procedure suitable for use herein involves subjecting the laminate to forming pressures at elevated temperatures, that is, a temperature which is sufficiently high to soften the thermoplastic core layer and permit the forming operation.to be carried out without concurrent delamination, weakening of the metal layers and or the thermoplastic core layer, and the like. For most of the laminates of the present invention the forming operation at or near ambient temperatures is to be avoided since most of the laminates within the scope of the invention would not be expected to be cold formable at such temperatures. Herein laminates are not considered to be cold formable if at or near ambient temperature performance in a deep draw test is poor and or the degree of bending sustainable is low and or performance in tne Olsen Cup Test is poor, such tests being further discussed hereinafter.Moreover, an additional advantage in carrying out the forming operation at elevated temp era tures is that such temperatures would usually effectively destroy the ambient temperature memory of the laminate, and thus its tendency to recover to its straightened andlor flattened configuration upon removal of the forming pressure.This loss of memory or reset is retained up to sub stantially the original forming temperatures and for some laminates even higher. As a result, at elevated temperatures laminates of the present invention prepared, for example, from ductile metal layers and a ductile thermoplastic core layer are formable into permanently shaped structures. An important measure of the formability of the laminates within the scope of the present invention may be gained in a deep drawing test, typical conditions for which are shown in the table below. In this test, a flat, circular sheet of laminate is forced into a female die by a male punch, to form a cup. A successful deep draw with a high draw ratio ratio of blank diameter to punch diameter is desirable. Draw ratios comparable to those of drawing quality steel of equivalent stiffness are preferred. Values which are 50 percent lower than such steel are acceptable for many applications but values much lower than this would usually be considered poor.For example, as shown in the following table, a very good draw ratio between about 2.00 and about 2.31 is obtained with aluminum nylon 6,6 aluminum or aluminum polyester polyether block copolymer modified PET aluminum laminates when the tests are conducted at temperatures between about 80 C. 176 F. and 200 C. 392 F. . ThiS ratio is comparable .o the value of about 2.4 for drawing quality steel and, in many instances, better than the value of about 2.1 for drawing quality aluminum. Laminates which have a core of nylon 6,6 and metal layers of ductile low carbon steel have been found to perform well in the deep draw test at ambient conditions. It will be noted, however, that the draw ratios shown in the table below are not limiting values, and therefore even higher draw ratios for such laminates are contemplated.

Another important measure of the formability of the laminates is the degree to which they can be bent without fracture. The degree of bending sustainable by most laminates of the present invention without fracture is extremely poor at ambient temperatures and would in many cases be unsuitable for any applications requiring simple bending around even fairly large radii. Bending would be in general considered poor if the laminate would not sustain a 900 bend around a radius two times the thickness of the laminate. At elevated temperatures many of the laminates can readily be bent, without fracture, around radii sufficiently small for many applications.It should be pointed out, however, that certain laminates within the present invention have been found to have good bending capability at ambient temperature, for example, laminates which had a nylon 6,6 core and ductile low carbon steel metal layers. It would be expected that other laminates within the present invention may also perform well in bending tests at ambient conditions. Still another test of formability is a ball punch deflection test. Such as the Olsen Cup Test which involves only stretch now draw and wherein a sheet of laminate sample is securely clamped in a ring die and stret,ch formed to failure first appearance OI a t racture wltn a hemispherical punch under conditions typically as shown in the table below. One measure of performance is the forming ratio ratio of punch penetration depth deflection to punch diameterj, with a high ratio being desirable. Using this test at low punch deflection rates about 1 27 cm min and ambient tempera tures, very good worming ratios or between about 0.300 and about 0.400 have been obtained for laminates within the scope of the present invention, for example, laminates which had a nylon 6,6 core and ductile low carbon steel metal layers and other laminates as shown in the table below. These values are comparable to and in many instances better than the values obtained for aluminum and steel. Ratios even lower tan 0.300, for example as low as 0.150, are acceptable for some applications but values much lower than this would be considered poor performance in this test.

It will be apparent, of course, that the laminates within the scope of the present invention, when considered with respect to the combination of critical properties which they possess as well as the excellent formability in most cases indicated by the high draw ratio, bending, and stretching characteristics obtained in drawing, bending and stretching tests, provide clear advantages over known laminates and other construction panel materials for use as construction panels then compared with metals per se, the combination of critical and important service properties high heat distortion temperature, low coefficient of Iin ea thermal expansion, low inelastic ratio, lightness in weight and excellent formability in most cases makes the lai nates even more desirable for use as construction panels. Very good ductility at ambient temperatures is exhibited by the laminates of the present invention when both the metal layers and the therinoplastic core layer are in ductile states0 It will be recognized that while it is possible to use non ductile forms of suitable metals in which higher flexural strength and higher effective flexural modulus laminates are obtained, the formability discussed hereinabove is substantially reduced. However, where shaped structures are not required or desired, and substantially flat structures are suitable, non ductile forms of suitable metals may be employed. One measure of the ductility of the laminates may be obtained via the aforemenLloned Olsen Cup Test.Other measures of ductility inol ze tensile elongation which is measured according to ASTM D 638 72 test method for plastics, and multi axial impact strength which is measured via te Gardener Impact Strength G1S Test. In the Gardner Impact Strength Test, a sheet of test specimen at least 5008 cm by 5.08 cm 2 inches by 2 inches in area is placed on the flat horizontal surface of a heavy steel test anvil The specimen is centered over a vertical cylindrical hole 3.18 cm 1.25 inch inside diameter in the test anvil. A light weight polished steel punch with a 1.59 cm 0.625 inch diameter bemispherical tip is placed on the top center of the specimen A 1082 kg 4 lbo hammer is dropped from a selected height onto the punch, thereby subjecting the specimen to an impact energy in N m tin. lbO determined by the product of the weight of the hammer and its initial height in cm inches .Each laminate specimen is impacted only one time, and the formation of any crack on either side of the specimen is considered a failure for the particular impact.The test usually requires a fairly large number of test specimens usually at least 12 to 16 for each test , and the maximum height at which more than half of the specimens pass without failure is used to calculate theGIS to within 0.226 N m 2 in. 1b. . From these measurements, it was determined that ductile laminates within the scope of the present invention having 20 to 30 percent less weight mass m2 than 000813 cm 0.032 inch thick automobile body steel show no failure at impact energies up to at least 18008 N m 160 inO lbO and exhibit significantly smaller dents at these impacts than do the 0 0813 cm thick steel panels. Similar results are also obtained when compared with aluminum panels.Thus, the metal thermoplastic metal laminates also possess high energy absorption ability in that they are capable of absorbing high impact forces with little, if any, denting, and, as an additional feature, any dents which do occur can be readily hammered out without damage. Excellent weathering resistance is another valuable property exhibited by the laminates of the present invention. It will be apparent, of course, that the metal layers, if unprotected steel and the like, will corrode upon long and continuous exposure to the weathering elements. However, the adhesion between the metal layers and the thermoplastic core layer is highly resistant tn weather. For example, little or no loss in adhesion occurs with aluminum nylon aluminum laminates after one month in boiling water. Further, aluminum nylon aluminum laminates show no loss in peel strength after 13 months in water, or after 11 months in saturated aqueous calcium chloride or sodium chloride solutions, all at ambient temperatures. The adhesive peel strength of the layers of the laminates of the invention are not narrowly critical and can vary over wide limits. There is no particular upper limit on the peel strength since in the construction applications contemplated, the stronger the adhe simon, generally the more suitable is the laminate, particularly in post forming operations. A lower limit on peel strength of the metal layer thermoplastic core layer adhesion, however, is much more important and generally should be greater than about 1.75 x 103 N m 10 pounds linear inch as measured by ASTM D 903 49 Reapproved 1972 . It will be apparent that, in addition to each of the properties ennumerated and discussed hereinabove, the metal thermoplastic metal laminates possess smooth metal surfaces. Since among the metals listed hereinbelow as being suitable, certain of the surfaces for example, steels, iron, and the like corrode upon continued exposure to weathering clements, it is highly advantageous to be able to easily apply a protective surface coasting to such corrosion prone metal surface and cure such protective coating so as to enhance the strength and hardness of the coating.and securely adhere it to the metal surface. Thus, the laminates shaped, as well as substantially fat are readily protected by applying con entional metal protective coatings to at least one of .h metal so races and curing the same at elevated temperatures. As an example, since the most common of such protective coatings is paint, the metal surfaces are easily primed and painted. The paint may be cured at elevated temperatures, without the laminate undergoing distortion. For example, with respect to automobiles, curlng of the paint often is carried out at temperat1res 25 high as about 163 C. 3250 F. . The painted laminate is thereafter cooled to ambient temperatures.It will be recognized, however, that the actual temperature employed to cure the protective coating may vary according to the protective coating. But regardless of the actual temperature employed, whether lower or higher,It is contemplated that the protective coating will be cured at an appropriate temperature easily determined b those skilled in the art.4. Component Materials of the Laminates Materials useful within the scope of the present invention must of necessity possess those properties and characteristics which will yield the laminate having an improved combination of service properties considered important and critical for demanding construction applications. Such critical combination of properties, as noted hereinabove, includes, among others, a heat distortion temperature of at least about 1300 C. 2660 F. , a coefficient of linear thermal expansion less than about 63 x 10 C. 1, an inelastic ratio less than about 93 , and a weight less than about 9.76 kg m2 2 lb. ft. 2 The thermoplastic core layer materials are selected from the group consisting of paitly crystalline oclyamides and polyesters.These thermoplastics possess the necessary properties to meet the requirements demanded of thermoplastics useful within the scope of the present invention. Included among the property requirements are a the the oplastic core layer materia must be partly crystalline and b the thermoplastic core layer material must have a crystalline melting point greater than 1300 C. 2660 F. . The term partly crystalline polyamides and polyesters is employed herein to describe polyamideand polyester based thermoplastic compositions, at least 407c by weight of which is organic thermoplastic polymer s , with at least 50 by weight of the organic thermoplastic polymer s being polyamide or polyester polymer chains or chain segments having a degree of crystallinity DC greater than about 15 . This at least 50 by weight is referred to herein as the partly crystallinepolyamide or polyester portion.The degree of crystallinity is specified by the following formula DC dpc d0c d100c d0c wherein o dpc is the density of the partly crystalline polyamide or polyester portions of the thermo plastic composition at 23 C., exclusive of substantial volume fraction s of other non crystallizable organic polymer modifier or inorganic filler phases which the thermo plastic core composition may contain o d is the density of the amorphous fractlo Oc DC 0 of the partly crystalline polyamide or polyester portion of the thermoplastic compositlon at 23 C. and d100c is the density of the crystalline fraction DC 100 of the partly crystalline polyamide or polyester portion of the thermoplastic compo sition at 23 C.The value of d100c may be calculated from the crystal type and crystal lattice parameters obtained from wide .angle X ray diffraction measurements. The value of doc may be obtained via density measurements on quenched samples exhibiting no apparent degree of crystallinity by X ray diffraction of differential scanning calorimetric measurements. Alternatively, the value of d Sned by . ained by extrapolating the dependence of den s ty of partly crystalline samples of the organic poly cr with known finite values of apparent degree of crys zallnit DC to the value of density d at which DCa is zerc.Values of DC for the partly crystalline or a ganic polymer samples may be determined either via wideangle X ray diffraction, as that percent the X ratiation diffracted at wide angles by the polymer crystallites is of the total X radiation both diffracted and scattered at wide angles by both the polymer crystallites and the amorphous portions of the polymer, or by differential scanning calorimetric measurements of the latent eat of melting, whereupon the apparent degree of crystallinity DCa is that percentage the measured heat of melting is of an estimated fixed value for the perfect polymer crystal In addition to the property requirements a and b listed hereinabove, the thermoplastic core layer preferably should be ductile, particularly in those laminates which are to be subjected to post forming operations and have a void level less than about 15 in that higher void levels tend to adversely affect the multiaxial impaet resistance and formability of the laminates fabricated therefrom, Materials which meet the above requirements of the thermoplastic core layer, as noted hereinabove, are selected from the group consisting of partly crystalline polyamides and polyesters having crystalline melting points greater than 1300 C. 2660 F. .

PARNs result when an aromatic residue or unit is substituted in whole or in part for a aliphatic residue or unit in an aliphatic nylon polymer.For example, substitution of all of the adipic acid HOOC CH2 4COOH residues in nylon 6,6 by those from mixtures of about 50 70t terephthalic acid TA, or p HOOC C6H5 COOH 50 308 isophthalic acid IA, or m HOOC C6H5 COOH gives suitable, PARNs which are high melting partly crystalline nylons 6,TA co 6,IA or poly hexamethylene tere co iso .phthalamides or poly iminohexamethyleneiminoterephthaloyl co isophthaloyls . Other suitable PARNs are partly crystalline nylons 6,6 co 6, TA, nylons 6,6 co 6,tA, nylons 6,6 co 6,TA co 6,IA, and other similar PARNs, including partly crystalline PARNs wherein some or all of the diamine residues have aromatic character and those containing lactam residues, such as nylons 6 co 6,6 co 6,TA. Various other types of copolyamides also are suitable. Examples are partly crystalline copolyamides of nylons 6 cO ll nylons 6 co 12 nylons 6 co 6,6 nylons 6 co 6,9 nylons 6 co 6,12 nylons ll co 12 nylons ll co nylons 11 co 6,9 nylons 11 co 6,12 nylons 6 co 6 6,10 nylons 6,6 co 6,9 co 6,10 nylons 6,9 co 6, TA c 6,IA and many other similar partly crystalline conoç amides. Various block copolymers with partly crystalline polyamide hard blocks or chain segments also are suitable. Examples of such materials are nylon 6 blockpoly tetramethylene oxide , nylon 6 block poly polypropylene oxide nylon 6 block poly caprolactone , nylon 6block poly butadiene , nylon 6 block poly dimethylsiloxane , nylon 6,6 block poly tetramethylene oxide , nylon 6,6 block poly propylene oxide , nylon 6,6 block poly butadiene , nylon 6,6 block poly dimethylsiloxane , and many other similar block copolymers with partly crystalline polyamide blocks or chain segments, including those with partly crystalline copolyamide blocks or chain segments, such as nylon 6,6 co 6 block poly tetramethylene oxide , nylons 6,TA co 6,IA blockpoly tetramethylene oxide .These block copolymers with partly crystalline chain segments and soft or rubbery or elastomeric blocks or chain segments can exhibit lownotch sensitivity and high toughness and resistance to impact, even at low temperatures. Other suitable types of block copolymers are those with more than one type of crystallizable hard blocks, such as nylon 6,6 blockpoly ethylene terephthalate , nylon 6,6 block poly tetra methylene terephthalate , and block copolymers where both types of blocks or chain segments are hard, but only the polyamide or copolyamide blocks or chain segments are crystallizable, such as nylon 6,6 block poly oxy l,4 , phenylenesulfonyl l,4 phenyleneoxy l,4 pheny leneisopropylidene l,4 phenylene , Numerous graft copolymers with partly crystalline polyamide or copolyamide bocks or chain segments also are suitable. Examples of such materials are poly ethylene co propylene graft nylon 6, poly ethyleneco propylene graft nylon 6,6, poly ethylene co propylene graft nylon 6,6, poly ethylene co propylene graft nylon 6,TA co 6,IA , poly butyl acrylate graft nylon 6,6, poly butyl acrylate graft nylon 6,TA co 6,IA , polyisobutylene graft nylon 6,TA co 6,IA e As in the case of certain block copolymers, soft, rubbery or elastomeric polymers grafted with partly crystalline polyamides or copolyamides can have low notch sensitivity and high toughness and resistance to impact even at low temperatures. Also suitable as the thermoplastic core layer in the laminates of this invention are blends or mixtures of the above partly crystalline polyamides, and polyamide and copolyamide block and graft copolymers.Examples are blends of nylon 6 with nylon 6 block poly tetramethylene oxide , nylon 6,6 with nylon 6 blockpoly propylene oxide , nylon 6,6 with poly ethyleneco propylene graft nylon 6,6, nylon 6,6 with poly butyl acrylate graft nylon 6,6 and many other similar blends.Such materials also can exhibit low notch sensitivity and high toughness and resistance to impact, even at low temperatures. Illustrative of suitable polyesters are partly crystalline poly alkylene terephthalates having alky line groups or residues with two to about ten carbon atoms, such as poly ethylene terepht halate , poly butylene terephthalate or poly tetramethylene terephthalate , polytdecamethylene terephthalate, poly l,4 cyclohexyldi methylol terephthalate and many similar partly crystalline poly alkylene terephthalates . Partly crystalline poly alkylene tereplithalateco isophthalates having alkylene groups with two to about eight carbon atoms and a terephthalate residue isophthalate residue ratio greater than about 2.5 also are suitable.

Partly crystalline. copolyesters of alkylene glycols with other aromatic dicarboxylic acids are also suitable . Examples are partly crystalline poly ethylene terephthalate co 2,2 biphenyldicarboxylates , poly butylene terephthalate co 4,4 biphenyldicarboxylates poly butylene terephthalate co phenylindanedicarboxylates , poly butylene terephthalate co t butylisophthalates , and poly butylene terephthalate co 2,6 naphthalenedicar boxylates . Partly crystalline copolyesters containing some aliphatic dicarboxylic acid residues, and which have high crystalline melting points i.e., above 1300 C. 2660 F. are also suitable. Examples are high melting, partly crystalline poly ethylene terephthalate co adipates , poly l,4 cyclohexyldimethyfol terephthalate co adipates , and poly butylene terephthalate co adipates Numerous partly crystalline aromatic polyesters and copolyesters are also suitable0 Examples are poly bi 4 hydroxy phenyl l,2 ethane isophthalate , poly bis 4 hydroxyphenyl methane isophthalatel, polylp hydroxyben zoyl co ethylene terephthalates , polylpthydroxybenzoyl co ethylene terephthalate co isophthalates , poly bis 4 hydroxyphenyl l,2 ethaie isophthalate co azelaoates , and poluy bis 4 hydroxyphenyl 1,2 ethane terephthalateco azelaoates . Just as block copolymers with partly crystalline polyamide chain segments are suitable as the thermoplastic core layer in the laminates of the present invention, so too are block copolymers with high melting, partly crystalline polyester of co polyester blocks or chain segments. A few examples of such block copolymers are poly ethylene terephthalate block poly tetramethylene oxide , poly butylene terephthalate block poly tetramethylene oxide , poly butylene terephthalate co isophtha late block poly tetramethylene oxides , poly ethylene terephthalate block poly E caprolactone , and poly tetra methylene terephthalate co isophthalate block poly buta dienes These types of block copolymers also can have low notch ens sensitivity and high toughness and resistance to impact, even at low temperatures Graft copolymers with high melting, partly crystalline polyester of copolyester blocks or chain segments also are suitable as the thermoplastic core layer. A few examples are high melting, partly crystalline polyisobutylene graft poly ethylene terephthalate , polyisobutylene graft poly butylene terephthalate , poly ethylene co propylene graft poly butylene terephthalate co isophthalaltes , and poly butadiene block poly butylene terephthalate . These types of graft copolymers also can have low notch sensitivity and high toughness and impact strength, even at low temperatures. The thermoplastic materials can be modified with fillers, reinforcing agents, plasticizers, stabilizers, flame retardants, and other polymer modifiers, as are well known in the art, in order to alter their properties and thereby enlarge the scope of applicability. One such modification comprises reinforcing the thermoplastic materials with mineral and or organic fillers and fibers which may have been treated with adhesion promoters or coupling agents capable of increasing the adhesion of the fillers and fibers to the thermoplastic matrix molecules. A large number or organosilane compounds discussed hereinbelow have been found to be especially capable of performing the task of improving the adhesion between thermoplastics and mineral fillers and glass fibers, thereby creating a synergistic effect when compared to non treated fillers and fibers. Preferred mineral fillers include small particle size quartz, wollastonite, feldspar, calcined kaolinite clay, and the like. The concentration of such mineral fillers, when employed, can vary from very small amounts, such as one or two percent by weight, up to about 508 by weight, or even higher, with concentrations between about 20 and about 45 by weight being preferred. Fibers suitable for use as modifying agents include glass fibers and other high modulus, high performance fibers, such as graphite, boron, steel, aromaticpolyamide fibers, potassium titanate wiskers and the like. It will be noted that while such high modulus high Perfor mance fibers glass fibers, for example improve the strength and flexural modulus of the thermoplastics such as herein employed, they result in a decreased multiaxial impact resistance. In spite of this apparent drawback, however, concentrations of fibers up to about 10 by weight or even higher for example, about 45 by weight may be advantageously employed for certain property enhancement, where desired. Metals which are useful within the pre ent invention are fairly wide in scope. Such metals, however, must meet certain requirements. These requirements are a the metal must have a melting point greater than the crystalline melting point of the thermoplastic core layer, that is, greater than at least 1300 C. 2660 F. b each metal layer must have a minimum thick nes of at least about 0.00127 cm 0.0005 inch, 0.5 mil . In addition to requirements a and b , the etais prefferably should have n tensile yield strength at an effset of 0.2 elongation greater than 1.82 x 106 N m2 264 1b. lin 1 at temperatures greater than the crystalline melting point of the thermoplastic core layer, a modulus of elasticity in tension greater than about 34.47 x 109 N m2 5 x 106 psi at ambient temperatures, and the metals preferably should ce ductile, particularly when the resultant laminates are to be subjected to post forming operations.The tensile yield strength at an offset of 0.2 elongation and he modulus of elasticity in tension are determined in accordance with ASTM D638 72 discussed hereinbefore. Metals which meet the above requirements, that s, those which sult in laminates possessing in combitation the critically important heat distortion tempera .ture of at least about 130 C. 266 F. , coefficient f linear thermal expansion less than about 63 x 10 6 C. 1, nelastic ratio less than about 93 , and weight less than about 9.76 kg m2 t2 lb ft. 2 , may be either ferrous or on ferrous Exemplary of the ferrous metals are steels, particalarly low carben teels, staipless steels, galvan ized iron, and the like. Non ferrous metals are exemplified by aluminum, magnesium, zinc, tin, nickel, titanium, copper, cobalt, beryllium, and high melting that is, greater than 1300 C. 266 F. alloys of each of these metals, such as various brasses and bronzes. The thermoplastic core layer and the metal .layers are uniformly and securely laminated together to forp thc laminates If desired, a suitable adhesion agent from among those listed hereinbelow may be employed to facilitate the formation of laminates possessing the critically important properties discussed in detail hereinbove. It will be noted that while the employment of an adhesion agent in the laminates is not essential, in general it is preferred to employ an adhesion agent to ensure strong jmetal thermoplastic adhesion. tor example, a peel strength of at least about 1.75 x 103 N m generally is adequate. It will be apparent, however, that even stronger metal thermoplastic adhesion is preferred. Adhesion agents, when employed, which are suitable for anchoring the metal layers to the thermoplastic core layer to provide adequate adhesion of the metal layers to the thermoplastic core layer are not narrowly critical. All that is necessary is that such adhesion agents are compatible with the laminate component layers and provide adhesion between the facing metal and thermoplastic core layers surfaces adequate for the contemplated end use. Such adhesion agents include, for example, organosilane adhesion promoters or coupling agents. Illustrative of classes of suitable organosilane adhesion agnets are amino functional alkyltrialkoxysilanes, epoxy functional alkyltrialkoxysilanes, glycidoxy functional alkyltrialkoxysilanes, and mixtures thereof. These classes of organosilanes are exemplified, respectively, by gamma aminopropyltriethoxysilane and N beta aminoethyl gamma aminopropyltrimethoxysilane, beta 3,4 epoxycyclohexyl ethyltrimethoxysilane, gammaglycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane, and gamma methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane. These compounds are commercially available from Union Carbide Corporation, New York,New York 10017 as A llOO silane, 0 li20 silane, A 186 silane, A 187 silane, and A 174 silane, respectively. Gamrna Glycidoxypropyltrinethoxysilane and N beta aminoethyl gamma propyltrimethoxysilane also are commercially available from Dow Corning Corporation, Midland, Michigan 48640 as Z6040 silane and Z6020 silane, respectively.Such silane coupling agents may be employed as alcoholic solutions, aqueous alcoholic solutions, or simply aqueous solutions. The conc entraLion of the silane solution typically is between about 0.01 and about 1.5 by weight. Other suitable adhesion agents may also be em ployed. Exemplary of such other suitable adhesion agents are adhesives such as nitrile rubber phenolic resins, epoxies, acrylonitrile butadiene rubbers, urethane modi ied acrylics, polyester co polyamides, polyester hot melts, polyester hot melts crosslinked with polyisocyan 3tes, polyisobutylene modified styrene butadiene rubbers, urethanes, ethylene acrylic acid copolymers, ethylenevinyl acetate copolymers, and the like. Of the suitable adhesion agents listed hereinabove, the organosilane adhesion promoters or coupling agents are preferred in that the resultant metal thermoplastic adhesion is both stronger and more resistant to deterioration and failure. Various techniques employing the adhesion agents noted hereinabove so as to ensure the required adhesion between the facing metal layer thermoplastic core layer surfaces are suitable. One such technique gives exceptional results when the metal layers are aluminum and the thermoplastic core layer is a nylon, a nylon copoly ier a nylon terpolymer, poly ethylene terephthalate , or modification thereof, An exemplary method employing this technique to fabricate the laminates so as to ensure strong metal thermoplastic adhesion may be described as follows, with aluminum and nylon 6,6 being used as the metal layers and the thermoplastic core layer, respectively, or convenience.The aluminum metal layers are first subjected to a degreasing operation to remove any grease and dirt from their surfaces although such degreasing is unnecessary, and therefore may be omitted, when the metal is already free of such contaminants .For example, washing the surface or complete submersion thereof in toluene or some other suitable solvent is convenient. If desired, the cleaned aluminum layers then may be soaked in a hot dichromate sulfuric acid chromic acid solution or a dilute solution of aqueous alkali metal hydroxide for example, sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide to etch the surface, although said etching is not an absolute necessity. Excess etching agent, whether hot chromic acid or dilute aqueous alkali metal hydroxide, is removed from t etched surface by thorough rinsing of such surface in water. Following the pre treatment when necessary , the aluminum metal layer surfaces are treated with an organosilane adhesion promoter to provide the preferred adhesion agent. Alternatively, the nylon 6,6 layer similarly may be treated with an organosilane adhesion promoter.But in any event, the organosilane adhesion promoter or in general the adhesion agent is interposed between the facing surfaces of the aluminum layers and the nylon ,6 layer regardless of whether it is placed on the surfaces of the aluminum layers or the surfaces of the nylon 6,6 layer. As noted hereinabove, however, the impcs tion of an organosilane adhesion promoter between the facing surfaces of the metal layers and the thermoplastic core layer, while convenient, is not a absolute necessity.Other adhesion agents tor no adhesion agent a alp so can be employed, although the organosilane adhesion promoters are preferred for use as adhesion agents. As an example, laminates comprised of aluminum, as the metal layers laminated to a thermoplastic core layer of a mincral reinforced nylon 6 co 6,6 VYDYNEs R 240 , and of aluminum laminated to a block copolymer HYTRELs 0 4056 modified poly ethylene terephthalate , can be prepared without utilizing any adhesion agent at all. Such laminates possess all the critical and important properties necessary for use as construction panels, even though the long term stability of the metal thermoplastic bond may suffer adversely. It will be appreciated, however, that when employed the particular pre treatment and adhesion agent, and procedure employed to provide the desired laminate will vary depending upon both the particular metal layers and thermoplastic core layer employed and their condition. The elevated temperatures and pressures employed in the preparation of the laminates are not narrowly critical. Suitable temperatures necessary for the formation of strong and secure metal thermoplastic adhesion can vary, for example, between about 1000C. 2120 F. and about 350 C. 6620 F. . In a similar manner, suitable pressures are those sufficient to maintain contact between the facing surfaces of the two metal layers and the thermoplastic core layer in order to pe vide metal thermoplastic adhesion having a peel strength of at least about 1.75 x 103 N m 10 lb. linear inch , . It will of course be appreciated that thepar ticular conditions of temperature, press ure and the like will vary depending upon the particular materials making up the laminates. A variety of methods of actually fabricating the laminates of the present invention may be employed including compression molding, extrusion lamination, and the like. One preferred method of fabrication of the laminates is to extrude a sheet of the thermoplastic material being employed and laminate the molten thermoplastic layer between the two metal layers, so as to betain excellent adhesion as noted hereinabove.It is also possible to cast some the rinoplastics, such as nylon 6 and its block copolymers, by polymerizing e caprolac kam by anionic polymerization in situ between the metal layers using acyllactams and the like such as acetylcap rolactam, adipoyl bis caprolactam, therephthaloyl bis caprolactam, isophthaloyl bis caprolactam, and the like as initiators. It is also contemplated that the metal layers can be preformed to the desired shapes by stan dard metal shaping techniques and held in a mold while the thermoplastic core layer is injection molded, com pression molded, or cast polymerized between them. 5. Experimental Examples The following Examples illustrate the present invention. They are not to be construed as limitive upon the overall scope thereof. EXAMPLE 1 A general description of the procedures em ployed to prepare the metal thermoplastic metal laminates of this invention is given below. The procedure can be conveniently described as a step wise procedure consis ting of the following operations in the order given a metal pre treatment 1 metal degreasing 2 metal cleaning etching b thermoplastic pre treatment c application of the adhesion agent if employed d fabricating the laminate. It will be noted, however, that steps a and or b mav be unnecessary and therefore may be omitted where the metal layers and or the thermoplastic core ay r materials are free from contaminating agents such , , and the like, for example, contempor ly or newly extruded materials. fa Metal Pre treatment 1 etal Degreasing The metal surface is cl aned when necessary of processing oils by vapor degreasing in a suitable solvent, such as trichloroethylene. Alternatively, the surface is wiped clean with a clean cloth a WebrilLitho Pad is convenient while immersed in a suitable solvent, such as, for example, trichloroethylene, l,l,l trichloroethane, toluene, acetone, and the like. The metal surface is thereafter rinsed with fresh solvent, either the same or different for example, an acetone rinse following an initial cleaning with toluene without wiping and the excess solvent allowed to evaporate. 2 Metal Cleaning Etching Following the degreasing Step a 1 when employed the metal preferably is cleaned etched prior to the application of the adhesion agent when employed in order to provide the highest metal thermoplastic adhesion strength, although in many cases the cleaning etching is not necessary. The metal surface can be etched by either chemical or non chemical means. Non chemical etching or mechanical abrasion includes brushing with a wire brush, grit blasting with alumina or steel grit, wet sanding, and the like. Either of these etching treatments is followed by degreasing as described in Step a Cl The chemical etching media may be either alkaline, acid or some combination thereof. Suitable alkaline etching media include aqueous solutions of sodium hydroxide, sodium netasilicate, proprietary metal cleaners available commercially, such as, for example Apex 764 M cleaner available froc Apex Alkali products Company, Philadelphia,Pennsylvania , and the like Suitable acid et ning media include dichromate sulfuric acid chromic acid solutions, aqueous hydrochloric acid solutions, phosphoric acid solutions, and the like. The particular medium employed may vary depending on the metal being used in that different metals sometimes require different treatments. In certain instances metals are suitably cleaned with several o the treat dents Exemplary treatments for specific metals include the following 1 Aluminum a sodium hydroxide solution, 2 5 at 25 C. b sodium metasilicate solution 50.0 grams liter at 700 CO c Apex 764 M cleaner 50ç0 grams liter at 700 C. and d sodium dichromate solution 30.0 grams sodium dichromate Na2Cr20702H20 , 150 milliliters concentrated sulfuric acid sp. gr. 1.84 , and 1 liter water at 600 C. 2 Low Carbon Steel a phosphoric acid, 2 at 250. Co 3 Stainless Steel a Apex 764 M cleaner 5000 grams liter at 700 C. b wipe with 1 1 hydrochloric acid water, abrade lightly with a wire brush, then Apex 764 M cleaner 50X0 grams liter at 700 CO and c abrade lightly with a wire brush, then Apex 764 M cleaner 50.0 grams liter at 70 C. The metal surface is etched by immersing the metal in the etching medium for an appropriate time period0 Typical treatment times are sodium hydroxide solution, 2 5 minutes Apex 764 Wi cleaner and sodium metasilicate solutions, 2 minutes dichromate sulfuric acid chromic acid and phosphoric acid solutions, 5 minutes. Following the cleaning etching treatment, the metal is thoroughly rinsed with water. hen an alkaline medium treatment is employed, in general, the metal is washed with hot, running water while wiping with a clean cloth a Webrils Litho Pad is convenient , followed by a hot water rinse without wiping. The metal is thereafter blown dry with a jet of clean air or nitrogen. When an acid medium treatment is employed, in general, the metal is washed successively with tap water and demineralized water. If a silane adhesion promoter is to be applied as in Step c , it usually is applied directly to the wet metal although it also can be applied to the dry metal, if desired. If silane is not to be used, the metal is first blown dry as described above and then oven dried at a suitably convenient temperature. b Thermoplastic Pre Treatment In order to obtain good metal thermoplastic adhesion during Step d hereinbelow, any processing aid present, for example, a mold release agent as in the case of a cast thermoplastic sheet, must be removed. If the thermoplastic is not to be used above its melting point in subsequent operations Step d J, its surface is prepared by thoroughly wiping with a suitable solventmoistened clean cloth, abrading lightly, again wiping the surface, and finally drying. On the other hand, if Step d involves melting the thermoplastic, the sanding or abrading step is not necessary unless it is to remove foreign material from the surface of the thermoplastic. c Application of the Adhesion Agent The application method for the adhesion agent when employed depends on the particular system being used. been adhesion agents referred to as adhesion promoters as for example, the organosilane coupling agents are employed, they are applied as dilute solutions usually about 0.01 to about 100 by weight to the surface in question. The amount of such agent applied to the surface in question is generally quite small, and only a small amount is retained on the surface a monomolecular layer being ideal for good metal thermoplastic adhesion. The gd hesion promoters may be applied to the metal surface and or the thermoplastic surface by immersing the surface in question into the solution or by spraying the solution onto the surface.In either case, the material is allowed to drain briefly and thereafter dried either by air drying or forced air drying with a jet of air or nitrogen without touching the silanetreated surface. An alternative method involves incorporating the adhesion promoter into the thermoplastic However, an application to themetal surface is the preferred method in that following the application, the metal can be readily baked at elevated temperatures, usually about 1300 C. for between about 5 minutes and about 30 minutes, to assure complete dryness of the metal surface prior to use in Step d . When adhesion agents such as an epoxy or a nitrile rubber phenolic system is employed, they are usually applied by conventional coating techniques, for example, metering bar, roll coater, and the like. Such adhesion agents are applied in an amount such that the thickness is measured in thousandths of a centimeter cm . They may be applied to the metal and or the thermoplastic surface. d Fabricating the Laminate Procedure 1 Adhesion Promoter AdhesionAgent Laminate The laminates containing the organosilane adhesion promoters are fabricated by placing a layer or sheet of metal on each side of a layer of thermoplastic, with the silane treated side of the metal layers in contact with the thermoplastic core layer. For com enience and to avoid polymer flash getting pin two hot press platens during the actual laminating phase, a throw away back up sheet is placed between the treated metal layers and the press platens, Thin gage aluminum foil is useful for this purpose. Additional back up sheets, for example , polished metal sheets to ensure surface smoothness of the finished laminate, can also be used. The assembly is placed in a press and heated above the melting point of the polymer under sufficient pressure to maintain contact between the metal and thermoplastic and to cause the thermoplastic to flow to the thickness desired. The laminates total thickness, in addition to the total thickness of the metal layers, is controlled by using suitable spacers between the platens or, preferably, a TEPLON9R coated metal mold frame of designated thickness around the perimetcr of the laminate assembly0 Contact at the desired temperature is maintained for a time sufficient to ensure good metal and thermoplastic adhesion, usually a few seconds up to about 30 minutes. The metalthermoplastic metal laminate is then cooled under pressure to below the melting point of the thermoplastic. The pressure is then released and the laminate removed from the press.Certain laminates, for example, those containing poly ethylene terephthalate based thermoplastics, are slowcooled under pressure in the press to about 80 1400 C below the crystalline melting point of the thermoplastic, and or after being removed from the press, the laminate is post annealed for about 1 hour, also at about 80 140 C. below the crystalline melting point of the thermoplastic. Procedure 2 Adhesive Adhesion AgentLaminate The laminates containing adhesive adhesion agents are fabricated by disposing a metal layer on each side of a thermoplastic core layer in such a manner that the adhesive adhesion agent is interposed between the facing surfaces of the metal layers and the thermoplastic core layer. The assembly is placed in a press and heated under pressure to cure the adhesive and obtain metal thermoplastic adhesion. Generally, the assembly is not heated above the melting point of the thermoplastic.As a result, the total thickness of the fabricated laminate is determined by the sum of the total thickness of the metal layers and the thickness of the thermoplastic core layer used to prepare it. Procedure 3 Non Adhesion Agent Laminate The laminates containing neither adhesion promoter nor adhesive adhesion agents are fabricated by disposing a metal layer on each side of the thermoplastic core layer in a suitable riold The assembly is placed in a press and heated above the melting point of the polymer to effect lamination as described in Procedure 1 above. Procedure 4 Continuous Extrusion Procedure The thermoplastic is extruded, in the melt between two layers of metal. Contact under pressure is maintained by pressing means such as suitably spaced, heated and or chilled rolls and or platens. Alternatively, the extruded thermoplastic melt may be allowed to solidify before contact with the metal alyers and then laminating as described in either of Procedures 1 , 2 or 3 , depending upon whether ar, adhesion agent is employed. Pressing means, such as suitably spaced, heated and or chilled rolls and or platens are used to effect the necessary con tact between the metal and thermoplastic.
