## Description
MAGNETIC THERAPEUTIC INSTRUMENT This invention relates to a magnetic therapeutic instrument and, in particular, to a magnetic therapeutic instrument enhibiting therapeutic effects produced by powerful magnetic field and germanium as well as stimulative effect on the human skin by pressing. Recently, various kinds of medical instruments utilizing the action of germanium which is effective for allaying the pain have been proposed. A chip of germanium sticked to the affected part of the human body can significantly allay the pain in the body.Effects of allaying such pains as stiffness in the shoulder, whiplash, lumbago, gout, and arthritis have been reported. On the other hand, magnetic therapeutic instruments of such type as provided with a permanent magnet embedded into a foundation sheet made of wood or synthetic resin or of type as consisting of adhesive plaster containing magnetic powder have been proposed. Germanium, however, is highly expensive and accordingly a therapeutic instrument is inclined to be costly. The joint use of the germanium employing instrument and the magnetic instrument is fundamentally incompatible with the intention of single use of the instrument as previously described. Further, an important point is that the abovesaid two kinds of instruments are devoid of action to flow electric current directly through the human body, thereby therapeutic effect thereof being limited. The inventor of this invention, after long yearns research conducted in view of drawbacks of the conventional instruments, has successfully developed a magnetic instrument of entirely new type on the basis of finding that molecules of germanium made up in the form of a thin film rather a solid chip can easily permeate the human body and DC current, though weak, can be flowed through the human body via metallic tapes of an instrument fabricated in accordance with this invention. Thus, an object of this invention is to provide a magnetic therapeutic instrument capable of utilising the combined thereapeutic effects provided by germanium and magnetism. Another object of this invention is to provide a magnetic thereapeutic instrument which is inexpensive. Still another object of this invention is to provide a magnetic therapeutic instrument capable of flowing weak electric current directly through the human body. One embodiment of the invention will now be described by way of example only, with reference to Figures 1 and 2 of the accompanying drawings of which Fig. 1 is a plan view of a magnetic therapeutic instrument according to this invention and, Fig. 2 is a representation of the above instrument applied to the affected part on the human skin. In the drawing, the reference numeral 10 indicates a detachable thick paper sheet which may be made of material of any kind but must be capable of sticking to and readily being detached from the adhesive foundation material that will be described later. This detachable paper sheet is provided with an opening slightly larger in diameter than the permanent magnet 20 as shown in the drawing and a cut part 11 communicating with the abovesaid opening for convenience for removing the sheet from the magnet. Therefore, the abovesaid detachable paper sheet 10 is sticked to the part of the adhesive foundation material 30 other than the surface thereof to which the permanent magnet is sticked. The adhesive foundation material 30 is in the circular shape like, for example, an adhesive plaster, to which the permanent magnet 20 made of, for example, ferrite is sticked at the reverse surface The permanent magnet 20 is a ferrite magnet in the shape of flat top and magnetized so as to be N and S in polarity at the right and the reverse surfaces, respectively, and to range from 750 to 850 oersteds in intensity of magnetic field. However, the magnet may be in the shape of coin . As a result, a magnetic field H is formed as shown inFig. 2. The entire surface of the permanent magnet is coated with gold or other precious metal 60 for example, silver in thickness of several microns by means of plating or evaporation. The surface to be brought into contact with the human skin is coated with a germanium layer 21 as shown in Fig. 2. Coating of precious metal 60 over the surface of the ferrite magnet as described above is intended for forming a circuit for flowing electric current through the human skin via metallic tapes welded to the magnet. The permanent magnet is not limited to ferrite type and may be of other rare earth type. The germanium layer 21 is 0.05 30 ssm in thickness and, as an important feature thereof, formed by the cluster ion bear method in a state such that the C axis direction of the film is aligned with the axis of the permanent magnet 20. The numeral 40 indicates a tape made of, for example, gold, copper or other metallic material and having one end electrically connected to the reverse surface of the permanent magnet 20 by means of, for example, welding. A single piece of metallic tape may suffice, however, two pieces arranged symmetrically with respect to the permanent magnet as shown in the drawing or more pieces may also fulfill the purpose. In applying such a magnetic therapeutic instrument as above to the human body, after removing the detachable paper sheet 10, the permanent magnet 20 is pressed so that the surface thereof is in tight contact with the affected part 50 of the human body and the adhesive foundation material 30 is also sticked to the skin. The metallic tapes 40 remain sticked to the adhesive foundation material 30 when the detachable paper sheet 10 is removed and, therefore, can easily be sticked to the affected part. The inventor has found that weak electric current ranging from 0.01 to 1 pA flows through the skin as described above with the use of a magnetic therapeutic instrument of this invention.Current is DC indicated as i which flows in the direction from the reverse surface of the permanent magnet 20 to the human skin as shown in Fig.2, whereby the flow of electron particles e is verified to be present within the skin as shown therein. Effect of a magnetic therapeutic instrument according to this invention was as follows With the application of the magnetic therapeutic instrument of this invention to 200 male adults of ages from 25 to 65 who were suffering from stiffness in their shoulders, 150 were re lieved from the pain group A , 30 felt thenselves relieved slightly but not so distinctly B , and remaining 20 felt that the therapy was ineffective C . On the other hand, in the case of application of the instrument having no metallic tape, the numbers of persons in the groups A, B, and C were 52, 13, and 135, respectively. Such investigation as above repeated several.times on other patients proved that the magnetic therapeutic instrument of this invention provided with metallic tapes which are essential requirement for fabrication of this instrument is superior to other instruments in therapeutic effect. Further, a trial application of a modification of such instruments as above magnetized to be S andN in polarity at the right and the reverse surfaces thereof metallic tapes were sticked to the magnet indicated that the numbers of persons in the groups A, B, and C were 32, 28, and 60, respectively. That is to say, the polarity of the permanet magnet is an important factor for the structure of the instrument of this invention and the right surface to be applied to the human skin should be N in polarity as well as the reverse surface be S without fail. A magnetic therapeutic instrument of this invention can repeatedly be used, however, it has been found that the germanium layer coating the permanent magnet disappears with the use of the instrument repeated as frequently as 5 times It is presumed that permeation of germanium molecules into the human skin accounts for the disappearance of the germanium layer.
