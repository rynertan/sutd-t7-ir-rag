A folding bic ycle as claimed in claim 1, and further characterised in a support member carried by said rear wheel assembly, said first pivot means being so located that when said bicycle is in its folded condition said support member acts as a base to support the folded bicycle unaided by other means, and when said bicycle is in its unfolded condition, said support member is substantially horizontal.

## Description
FOLDING BICYCLE The present invention concerns folding bicycles. Folding bicycles are already well known. BelgianPatent specification No. 628, 783 to Raimondi describes a folding bicycle wherein the rear wheel assembly is pivotable downwardly about the axis of the treadle.However the folded condition is not sufficiently compact for easy transport, nor is the bicycle stable in its folded condition. U.S. Patent No. 3,983,322 shows a more compact form of folded bicycle than Raimondi but requires a substantially more complex series of hinge arrangements between the main frame and the front and rear wheel assemblies. The present invention avoids the disadvantages of the above known folding bicycles by the fact that there is provided pivot means interconnecting said main frame member and said rear wheel assembly whereby said rear wheel assembly can pivot relative to said main frame member in the plane of said rear wheel into a folded position in which the axle of said rear wheel is located beneath said main frame member, the position of said pivot means being such that the rear wheel moves to a position when folded which lies substantially between the positions occupied by the front and rear wheels when the bicycle is unfolded and means interconnecting said front frame and said main frame assembly whereby said front wheel assembly may be moved on folding into a position in which said front wheel lies substantially alongside said rear wheel when the said rear wheel assembly is in its folded condition. In the specification and claims all references to directions of movement of various parts of the bicycle or to directions of axes are given in relation to a bicycle in its unfolded or operative condition. In order that the present invention may be more readily understood an embodiment thereof will now be described by way of example and with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a side elevation of a bicycle constructed, in accordance with the present invention, Figure 2 is a similar view showing the bicycle folded, Figure 3 is a diagrammatic end view of the front ofthe bicycle of Figure 2 showing how the handlebars of the bicycle fold, and Figures 4a, b and c are diagrammatic views showing various stages in the folding of the bicycle. The folding bicycle shown in the accompanying drawings has a front wheel assembly comprising a front wheel 1 mounted on a fork 2 above which is mounted a pair of handlebars 3 each of which can be folded downwardly to lie alongside the wheel 1. Each handlebar 3 can pivot relative to the fork and front wheel. In the unfolded position a stop 7 mounted on the fork and located between the pivots of the handlebars 3 prevents them from moving towards one another beyond the position shown in Figure 3 and the handlebars are held in this position by a link 8. The front wheel assembly including the handlebars 3 and wheel 1 pivot about a conventionally inclined steering pivot 10 carried in the front part Ila of a main frame member 11, the front part lia being pivoted to the rear part lib of the main frame at 12. The pivot comprises a tubular portion on the front part lia received within a cylindrical, portion on the rear part 11b so as to be capable of rotation therein.The pivot 12 is provided with a releasable clamping mechanism 13 which frictionally clamps the two parts against relative pivoting, the clamping mechanism 13 enabling the parts to be clamped relative to one another in both the erect and the folded condition of the bicycle. The rear end of the part 11b carries a tubular seat support member 14 in which is received a tubular seat strut 15 which in turn receives a seat post 16 carrying a saddle 17. The height of the seat can be adjusted by sliding the post 16 in the strut 15 and then clamping it with a clamp 18. The saddle support strut 15 is also slidable relative to the saddle support member 14 and can be clamped relative to the latter by a clamp 19.At its lower end the saddle support member 14 carries a horizontal pivot 20 about which a rear wheel frame in which the rear wheel 21 is mounted can pivot during folding and unfolding of the bicycle. It will be appreciated that this pivot 20 is located behind the axis about which the chain wheel 22 of the bicycle rotates the importance of this will become apparent when the operation of folding the bicycle is explained hereinafter. The chain wheel 22 is provided as usual with pedals 23. The rear wheel assembly comprises a pair of tubular struts 24 connected at their upper and lower ends by cross bars to form a rectangular frame. The upper end of this frame is connected to a luggage carrier 25 and the lower end to a pair of tubular struts 26 extending on either side of the rear wheel 21 to carry the hub 27 of the rear wheel. Additionally bracer struts 28 extend on either side of the wheel 21 from the hub to the struts 24 and the luggage carrier 25 respectively. The struts also carry a resilient shock pad 28 which when the bicycle is in its erect condition bears against the seat support strut 15. It will be appreciated that the pivot 20 is the only point of connection between the rear wheel frame and the remainder of the bicycle. Thus if the bicycle is lifted vertically off the ground the whole rear wheel frame will pivot downwardly about the pivot 20.In use the combined effect of the weight of the bicycle and a rider will mean that the bicycle will behave as if the rear wheel assembly were rigidly mounted as in a conventional bicycle save that the resilient pad 28 will act as a shock absorber. The bicycle is provided with a spring biased arrangement which keeps the chain under tension when the bicycle is folded. The folding operation of the bicycle from the erect configuration of Figure 1 to the folded configuration ofFigure 2 will now be described. Firstly the link 8 is disconnected. This enables the handlebars to be folded downwardly as shown in Figure 3 andFigure 4a. By lifting the bicycle by the seat 17 or seat support strut 15 or other convenient hold on the central frame, the rear wheel frame rotates clockwise about the pivot 20. This is shown in Fig. 4b. Thus the hub of the rear wheel moves from a position behind the strut 15 to a position in front of the strut 15 until the rear of the luggage carrier 25 touches the ground and, by pushing the bicycle backwards, this rotation is continued until the rear wheel 21 comes into contact with the base of part 11b of the main frame. This is the position shown in Figure 4c. At this stage the whole machine is supported on the now inverted luggage carrier 25. The clamp 13 is now released and the forward part Ila of the main frame together with the front wheel assembly with the now folded handlebars, is drawn round so that it rotates clockwise as seen from above about the pivot 12. This rotation is continued until the front wheel lies alongside the rear wheel. The clamp 13 is then done up again, so securing the two parts lia, 11b, in the folded configuration. The right hand pedal is now pushed backwards and down until it lies adjacent the front wheel and folded handlebars. If the left hand pedal is foldable, it may now be folded.The clamps 18 and 19 holding the saddle are now released and the saddle is pushed down, until the clamp 18 butts against the clamp 19 and the lower end of strut 15 engages the shock pad 38 and so stops rotation of the rear frame. The bicycle may now be carried, possibly by a suitably placed carrying handle not shown , the rear frame being prevented from rotating downwardly by virtue of the strut 15 bearing on the rubber shock pad 38. It will be appreciated that the above description has been solely concerned with a pedal bicycle. However, the manner in which the handlebars, main frame and rear frame fold, together with the associated clamps are of course equally applicable to a bicycle propelled by other meansSuch a bicycle might have an electric or internal combustion engine driving either the front or rear wheel. In such a case it might be possible to dispense with the pedal and chain drive.
