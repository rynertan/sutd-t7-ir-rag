# A SAFETY DEVICE FOR GAS HEATING APPARATUS

## Abstract
A safety device for gas heating apparatus, is provided which is responsive to a reduction in the oxygen content in the environment in which the apparatus is located, to close a main solenoid valve 3 controlling the gas supply. The device includes a temperature transducer the tem perature sensitive element 13 of which is fixed to the outside of the wall 16 of a pilot burner tube 2 to detect its temperature. In dependence on the detected temperature, the transducer generates a signal which, when the pilot flame burns in a first position A in the pilot burner tube 2 , corresponding to normal environmental conditions, main tains the gas supply solenoid valve 5 open and which on the other hand causes the latter to close when the pilot flame burns in a second position B as a result of its displacement due to a lowering of the oxygen content in the environment.
