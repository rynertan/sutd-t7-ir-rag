## Description
This invention relates to a process for the prepartion of aryl alkyl ketones by reacting an aryl compound with an aliphatic acid or a functional derivative thereof or of their mixtures in anhydrous hydrofluoric acid. More particularly, the process of this invention may be represented by the following diagram wherein The compounds of formula II are useful as intermediates for the preparation of Naproxen by rearrangement of halo ketals European Patent No. 0035305 or by the Darzens reaction JP Kokai 75 18448, C.A. It is known that acylation of 2 methoxy naphthalene with derivatives of aliphatic acids, more particularly with aliphatic acyl halides, in the presence of Lewis acids according to the Friedel Crafts reaction leads to different products depending on the solvent used J. Chem. Soc. C , In particular, the 2 methoxy 6 acyl naphthalenes may be prepared only in nitrobenzene loc. cit. Org. Synthesis, Said processes have however serious drawbacks when it is sought to carry out them on an industrial scale. Carrying out of the process in nitrobenzene or nitroalkanes, in addition to the well known problems connected with toxicity of the nitro derivative, also involves considerable labor and energy costs because of the type of operations required, i.e. careful temperature control during addition of the reactants and during quenching of the aluminium chloride, filtration and discharge of the aluminium derivatives, and recovery of the nitro derivative by distillation. Lastly, this process may be carried out only using acid halides because the aliphatic acids do not react and the anhydrides require greater quantities of both Lewis acid and solvent. Polyphosphoric acid is difficult to use because of its pasty consistency, requires high temperatures, cannot be recovered, and is difficult to waste. It has now been found that the compounds of formula II may be readily prepared in accordance with the reaction diagram indicated above in anhydrous hydrofluoric acid. A first advantage of this process is that, differently from known processes, the acylating agent of formula I can be not only a halide but also the acid or the anhydride of the acid or acid anhydride, acid halide, anhydride halide mixtures or ternary mixtures. A second advantage of this process is that it does not require the use of aluminium chloride nor other conventional catalyst of the Friedel Crafts reaction their possible addition does not affect the yields. A further advantage of the process according to this invention is that hydrofluoric acid is easily recovered by distillation because of its low boiling point 19.5 C . The possible presence of aliphatic acid or its functional derivatives in the hydrofluoric acid thus recovered is not an obstacle to recycling it. Another advantage of this process is that no substantial racemization occurs when is used an optically active acylating agent of formula I where X is chlorine and R is methyl thus obtaining an optically active compound of formula II which is a suitable intermediates for stereospecific preparation of Naproxen according to known techniques. Owing to its simplicity and great flexibility the process of this invention lends itself to numerous variants without departing from the inventive idea. The following examples will serve to illustrate this invention without however limiting it. 56.7 g 0.43 mol of propionic anhydride and 50 g 0.32 mol of 2 methoxy naphthalene were added to 200 ml of anhydrous hydrofluoric acid. The reaction mixture was stirred at 19 C for 28 hours and then poured into ice and extracted with methylene chloride 3 x 200 ml . The combined organic extracts were neutralized with a 10 aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide and then washed with water, dried over sodium sulphate and concentrated. The residue 63 g contained 84 of the desired product yield, 77 and less than 1 of the isomer 1 2 methoxy 1 naphthyl propane 1 one. Pure 1 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl propane 1 one was obtained by crystallization of the crude with suitable solvents such as methanol, heptane, toluene, and their mixtures. Similar results were obtained by Working as described in the above Example 1 but substituting the propionic anhydride with acetic anhydride 43.9 g, 0.43 mol 52.5 g of crude containing 89 2 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl ethane 1 one yield, 86 were obtained and then purified by crystallization. To 225 g of anhydrous hydrofluoric acid, 49.5 g 0.57 mol of propionyl chloride and then 70 g 0.44 mol of 2 methoxy naphthalene in 90 g of anhydrous hydrofluoric acid were added at 19 C. The reaction mixture was maintained at 40 C for 71 hours and then worked up as disclosed in Example 1. To 460 g of anhydrous hydrofluoric acid, 38.3 g 0.3 mol of S 2 chloro propionyl chloride α 25 D 1.64 neat, 1 1 optical purity, 31 and then 32 g 0.2 mol of 2 methoxy naphthalene in 50 ml of methylene chloride were added. The reaction mixture was maintained at 20 C for 22 hours and then worked up as disclosed in Example 1. The residue was purified on a silica gel column eluent, toluene 4 g of S 1 chloroethyl 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl ketone was obtained having α 25 D 31.2 c 1 , chloroform optical purity 27 .
