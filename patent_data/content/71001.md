# Low antimony lead base alloy.

## Abstract
Low antimony lead alloys suitable for use as grid material in maintenance free high capacity lead acid batter ies are disclosed. The alloys comprise 0.6 to 1.1 weight percent antimony, 0.06 to 0.25 weight percent arsenic, 0.1 to 0.4 weight per cent tin, 0.06 to 0.11 weight percent copper, and the balance lead. A preferred alloy contains 0.8 weight percent antimony, 0.15 weight percent arsenic, 0.25 weight percent tin and 0.08 weight percent copper.
