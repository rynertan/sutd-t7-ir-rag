## Description
PROCESS FOR FORMING A LAMINATED PLASTIC COVERING ON A WOODEN PANEL p9rroJAoc oJtQs The present invention relates to a process for forming a lami nated plastic covering onto a shaped wooden panel. It is known that at present, in the production of furniture and particularly kitchen furniture, a wide use is made of composite wooden panels of different nature, more commonly called shaving panels , which are covered with so called laminated plastic . Such laminated plastic covering is designed first of all, to protect the wooden panel, thanks to its surface characteristics of hardness and of resistance to abrasion, to heat and to chemical etching secondly, to strengthen the panel, thanks to its excellent characteristics of mechanical resistance, which will thereby be conferred onto the panel itself once the laminated plastic has been firmly associated thereto and finally, to decorate the panel, in that the surface of the laminated plastic may display different designs and colours, at choice. According to a terminology widely diffused at present, the term laminated plastic implies a semirigid flat sheet, of a thickness usually comprised between six tenths and twelve tenths of a millimeter, obtained by overlapping and flat hot pressing a plurality of paper or wood pulp sheets imbued with synthetic resin. For instance, to obtain a laminated plastic sheet of seven tenths of a millimeter, one may use three sheets of paper of 160 g sqm imbued with phenolic resin, plus a superficial sheet of paper of 80 120 g sqm imbued with melaminic resin, which also acts as decorative sheet, and eventually interpose a sheet of so called barrier paper , which is apt to prb vent the primary colour of the first sheets from affecting the colouring of the decorative sheet. As said, this plurality of sheets is flat hot pressed in order to obtain a semirigid laminate, which is subsequently cut to size so as to be applied as a covering on all the faces of a panel meant to form part of a furniture piece. Though this technique now used since many years is generally widespread, it is however not free from drawbacks. If one considers, for instance, a panel designed to form the door of a furniture piece, even supposing that it had the simplest configuration of a very flat right parallelepipedon, it would still normally be necessary to cut to size six pieces of laminated plastic, two by two of equal size, in order to cover the six faces of the panel cold glue or, more often, hot glue with adhesives the six pieces, individually, onto the six faces of the panel and trim, after desiccation of the glueing, all the edges of the panel, taking into account that it is practically impossible to cut the pieces of laminated plastic and glue them together with sufficient precision to avoid subsequent finishing operations. Nevertheless, and in spite of using appropriately studied synthetic adhesives, a breakaway of the laminated plastic pieces especially of those covering the smaller surfaces, on the sides may take place in the long run, for instance due to penetration of humidity in correspondence of the edges. Various systems have been studied in order to overcome the above drawbacks at least partly. example, in the Italian Patent No. 803.400, in the name of the same Applicant, it has been proposed to create pre moulded laminated plastic elements of a predetermined size and shape, with a technique such that once they had been applied and glued for instance onto a panel forming the door of a cupboard they came to form a continuous covering both of the main exposed face of said panel and of its two vertical sides adjacent to said face. The covering of the o ther major face was then obtained in the usual manner, by means of a flat piece of laminated plastic, while other types of finishings were applied in correspondence of the other two horizontal sides, for example swages in the form of a listel or of a gripping handle. This technique, though offering undoubted advantages, suffers nevertheless from evident limitations, especially due to the fact that it only very slightly reduces the problems connected with glueing. Another known proposal is that of the so called postforming technique. This consists in producing laminated plastic through the usual flat hot pressing method, but without carrying out thoroughly the polymerization, that is, the hardening of the resins which imbue the wood pulp papers. In this manner, one obtains laminates which may before their subsequent glueing onto the wooden panels be hot bent by means of special tools and be thus adapted to any curved surfaces of the panel. This technique is particularly used, for example, to form laminates apt to cover the front surface and the sides of panels whose vertical edges are arch beveled. Also this technique suffers however from considerable limitations, especially due to the fact that the laminate may be bent only within certain limits, and in particular, without going below a bending radius of about 1 cm. One should also finally mention though not strictly inherent in the problem of the present invention the technique of producing the so called ennobled panels. This technique consists in carrying out the flat hot pressing of large wooden shaving panels, by previously applying on the two main faces of the panel a sheet of melaminic paper of 80 100 g sqm. The large flat panels thereby obtained are then cut to size for the most varied uses. These panels are however seldom used, and in any case they are used for productions of inferior quality in the manufacture of fur niture in fact, both the overall mechanical resistance of the panel, and its characteristics of surface resistance are very modest. It is for this reason that this technique is not considered as pertaining to the field of the present invention. The object of the present invention is actually to obtain wooden panels particularly suited for the production of furniture, having basically the same characteristics of the traditional panels covered with laminated plastic, that is, great structural stoutness, and excellent surface characteristics of resistance to abrasion, heat and corrosion in general but being furthermore apt to preserve these characteristics longer in time, without having to suffer from any faults or ageing of the glueing to acquire different shapes, other than the simple right parallelepipedon, which had never been obtained so far and to be besides produced by a simpler and quicker method than heretofore. This object is reached with the process according to the present invention, which is essentially characterized in that, onto at least one main face of a wooden panel cut to size and eventually shaped, there is applied a plurality of paper sheets imbued with synthetic resin, and in that this plurality of sheets is then hot pressed into a shaped mould, an element of which is constituted by the wooden panel itself. Further characteristics and advantages of the process according to the present invention will anyhow result more evident from the following description of some embodiments thereof, given by mere way of example and illustrated in the accompanying drawing, in which Figures 1 and 3 show a schematic cross section view of two types of wooden panels, ready to be mould pressed with the process according to the invention and kigaPes 2 and 4 tshow the same panels of figures 1 and 3 respecti vely, in the mould pressing phase. As shown, onto a mould part 1, which in this case is a flat part, is rested the wooden panel 2, the upper face of which is shaped with a profile having also some sharp edges. Several sheets 3 of paper, imbued with synthetic resin, are laid onto this upper face. The choice and number of these sheets is determined in the usual manner, adopted for the production of laminated plastic. For instance, it will be possible to lay one upon the other 2 3 sheets of phenolic paper of 150 g sqm, and one sheet of melaminic paper of 120 g sqm having a decorative function, as well as possibly a barrier paper. The mould part 4 figure 2 is then moved down onto this plurality of paper sheets, its moulding surface corresponding to the upper face of the panel 2. The paper sheets 3 are thus practically moulded between two half moulds consisting, on one side, of the mould part 4 and, on the other side, of the panel 2 itself.The following essential advantages result therefrom on one hand, a perfect shaping, also with sharp edges as it had never been possible to obtain so far of the laminate 3 formed by the group of sheets 3 on the other hand, an exact mating of the laminate 3 with the profile of the panel 2, without the need for any further finishing operations and finally, a perfect and lasting adherence of the laminate 3 to the panel, thanks to the fact that the resins with which the sheets 3 are imbued polymerize directly onto the face of the panel 2. Figures 3 and 4 show the production of another type of panel and place in evidence some further advantages of the invention. First of all, the laminated plastic is formed on the upper face as well as on the lower face of the panel 2. To this end, it is sufficient to place a number of paper sheets 3 onto the mould part 1, to subsequently place thereon the panel 2, and to finally lay thereupon a further number of paper sheets 3. When pressing is carried out, a irst sheet of laminated plastic 3 is formed between the two half moulds consisting of the mould part 4 and of the panel 2, and another sheet of laminated plastic 3 is formed between the two half moulds consisting of the same panel 2 and of the mould part 1. Figures 3 and 4 place in evidence also a further characteristic of the invention. In figure 3 it can in fact be seen that, before moulding, the upper surface of the panel 2 is flat. However, the mould part 4 comprises a series of parallel ribs 5, running along an alignment perpendicular to the drawing sheet. The e effect of these ribs is to cause a marked compression of the panel 2, in correspondence of said ribs, and thus the forming of grooves 5 into which gets moulded also the laminated plastic 3 . The effect produced by the grooves 5 if the decorative surface of the laminate 31 imitates the natural grain of wood is that of a final panel which looks as if it were formed by side by side listels, similar to the matchboards . Further types of effects may easily be imagined. It will simply be necessary, in forming the ribs 5 or other similar reliefs, to make sure that these reliefs are not too marked, so as not to cause the tearing or cutting of the sheets 3 during pressing. A further advantage of greatest importance which appears evident in figure 4 is that, in the area of the edges 6, namely in correspondence of the connection point between the laminate 3 , formed on the upper face of the panel, and the laminate 3 , formed on its lower face, one obtains thanks to the polymerization of the two laminates, one in contact with the other a perfect sealing, lasting with time. The final result is thus equal to that of a laminated plastic surrounding completely the panel 2, without any gaps, and this result is of utmost importance for the life of the panel and for its resistance to ageing and to humidity. The e additional finishing operations onto a panel thus formed, will hence be confined to the mere trimming in correspondence of the edges 6. Even this operation may however be eliminated if the mould parts 1 and 4 are shaped, in correspondence of said edges 6, so as to additionally operate a clear cutting of the sheets 3 of treated paper. It is evident that the heretofore described and illustrated embodiments have been given by mere way of example, but that there may be many variants differing therefrom, all within reach of an expert in the art, but all falling within the protection scope of the present invention.
