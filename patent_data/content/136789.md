# Hydrocarbon conversion catalyst.

## Abstract
Catalysts of improved strength and activity are formed by compositing a clay matrixing material with a zeolite which contains cations of a Group IB metal, preferably a monova lent metal such as silver and by thereafter calcining the composite at temperatures in excess of 600 C. The presence of the cations gives the zeolite improved resistance to the high sintering temperatures necessary to confer adequate strength upon the resulting catalyst.
