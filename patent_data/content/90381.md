# Electrode and method of electrolysis.

## Abstract
Anodes having a substantially impermeable coating or surface, obtained by moulding under pressure and heat an electrocatalytic layer consisting of a mixture of powders of an electrocatalytic material 2 and inert thermoplastic resin on a conductive body 1 or substrate, consisting of a mixture of powders of graphite and inert resin, resist surprisingly well to the electrochemical attack and offer significant advantages over the much more expensive activated titanium anodes.
