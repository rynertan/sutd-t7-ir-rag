# Improved ultrasound imaging with FM detection.

## Abstract
An ultrasound transducer 110 having an annular acoustic aperture is utilized in combination with an echo ultrasound imaging system having an FM detector 160 . The off axis transfer function characteristics of the annular transducer substantially improve the lateral resolution of the imaging system as compared with prior art systems.
