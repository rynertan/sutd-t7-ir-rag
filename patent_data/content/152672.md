# ADJUSTABLE ANVIL FOR ULTRASONIC MATERIAL CUTTING AND SEALING APPARATUS

## Abstract
A improved anvil construction, for use in an ultrasonic apparatus for edge cutting and sealing moving lengths of at least partially thermoplastic material M , particularly textile fabric having at least some thermoplastic fibers, and includ ing a vibrating sonic horn 14 cooperating with and vibrat ing against an anvil 12 for such ultrasonic edge cutting and sealing as the material M moves between the sonic horn 14 and the anvil 12 . The anvil 12 includes a peaked cutting edge 21 and first and second surfaces 22, 23 extending in respective opposite directions from the cutting edge 21 and is characterised by being adjustable to posi tions for effecting clean and sharp edge cutting and desired amounts of edge sealing in the material M while resisting wear on the anvil 12 . Such adjustment is in the form of pivotal movement of an anvil member 20 to adjust the acuteness of the included angles A, B of the first and second surfaces 22, 23 extending from the cutting edge 21 of the anvil 12 and in the form of timed rotation of the anvil member 20 so that a fresh portion of the cutting edge 21 thereof may be positioned for contact by the sonic horn 14 when wear occurs on such cutting edge 21 .
