## Description
SUBSTITUTED TETRAHYDROFURAN HERBICIDES The present invention relates to substituted tetrahydrofuran derivatives, a process for their preparation, herbicide compositions containing them and a method of controlling unwanted plant growth using them. Certain tetrahydrofuran derivatives are known to be active herbicides, for example, see German Offenlegungsschrift No.2749974 and European Patent Application No. 0000002. It has now been found that certain novel tetrahydrofuran derivatives also have useful herbicidal properties. The present invention provides a tetrahydrofuran derivative of the general formula EMI1.1 wherein each of R0, R, RÚ, Rê, and R independently represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group or R0 and R together represent anEMI1.2 wherein R represents a hydrogen atom or an optionally substituted aryl or alkyl group and R5 represents a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group, an alkenyl group or an alkynyl group and Ar represents an optionally substituted fully unsaturated ring having 5 or 6 atoms in the ring of which one is a nitrogen atom and the remainder are carbon atoms, or the N oxide or an acid addition salt thereof, orAr represents an optionally substituted phenyl group. Suitable substituents which may be present in an optionally substituted aliphatic group include halogen atoms, alkoxy, alkylthio, cyano, carboxy, alkoxycarbonyl, amino and cycloalkyl groups, optionally substituted phenyl and phenoxy groups, and groups of the formula OA in which A represents a hydrogen atom or an acyl group derived from a carboxylic or a substituted carbamic acid.Suitable substituents which may be present in an optionally substituted aryl, especially phenyl, group include halogen atoms, hydroxy, amino, cyano and nitro groups, and optionally substituted alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, alkoxy, alkylthio, alkoxycarbonyl, aryl and aryloxy groups. An aryl group and in particular a phenyl group is preferably unsubstituted or substituted by up to 3 of the same or different substituents given above. Most preferably it is unsubstituted, monosubstituted or disubstituted. Preferred substituents are selected from halogen atoms, and nitro, cyano, alkyl, haloalkyl, alkoxy, haloalkoxy, alkylthio, aryl and aryloxy groups. Typically the substituents are selected from halogen atoms and alkyl, alkoxy, alkylthio, aryl and aryloxy groups. A heterocyclic group Ar may be substituted by one or more of the substituents given above for a phenyl group preferably however it is unsubstituted or substituted by one or more alkyl groups or halogen atoms most preferably such a group is unsubstituted. Preferably R0 and R are the same and each represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group of up to 6 carbon atoms preferably R represents an alkyl group of up to 6 carbon atoms preferably R2 and R3 each represent a hydrogen atom preferably 4R represents an alkyl group of up to 6 carbon atoms and pre ferably R5 represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl group of up to 6 carbon atoms. More preferably R0 and R are the same and each represents an alkyl group of up to 4 carbon atoms R represents an alkyl group of up to 4 carbon atoms R and R3 each represent a hydrogen 4 atom R represents an alkyl group of up to 4 carbon atoms and 5R represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl or alkynyl group of up to 4 carbon atoms. As noted above, the Ar substituent in formula I may represent an optionally substituted fully unsaturated ring having 5 or 6 atoms in the ring of which one is a nitrogen atom. Suitable heterocyclic groups in this regard include optionally substituted pyridyl, pyrrolyl and azacyclopentadiene groups. These heterocyclic groups are preferably bonded to the rest of the molecule through a carbon atom and the nitrogen atom in the ring is preferably adjacent to this carbon atom.Preferably Ar represents a pyridyl, especially a 2 pyridyl, group or an optionally substituted phenyl group, especially an unsubstituted phenyl group or a phenyl group substituted, preferably in the 2 position, with an alkyl group of up to 3 carbon atoms, or by one or more fluorine and or chlorine atoms preferably in the 2 position by a chlorine atom, a fluorine atom or in the 2 and 6 positions with a chlorine atom or a fluorine atom or a mixture thereof. Most preferred compounds according to formula I are those wherein each of RO and R represents a methyl group, R1 represents an ethyl group, each of Rê and R represents a hydrogen atom, R4 represents a methyl group, R5 represents a hydrogen atom, and Ar represents a phenyl group, a 2 chlorophenyl group, a 2 fluorophenyl group or a 2 pyridyl group. The compounds of the general formula I exist in the form of optical isomers, and may also exist as geometric isomers, depending on the substituents present in the molecule. It should be understood that the present invention includes all such isomers and mixtures thereof. The invention also provides a process for the preparation of a compound according to the invention in which a tetrahydrofuran EMI4.1 is converted into an alkali metal or alkaline earth salt thereof, and reacted with a compound of the general formulaEMI4.2 in which Hal represents a halogen atom and R3 and Ar have the meanings given for the general formula I and optionally converting the resulting compound of the formula I in which X represents aEMI4.3 group, into any other compound of the general formula I. The compound of general formula II may be converted into a salt thereof by reaction with a base. Alkali or alkaline earth metal hydroxides, alkoxides or hydrides are suitable bases. The alcohol may be converted into its salt prior to admixing it with the compound of formula III, or the salt may be formed in situ by admixing the compounds of the formulae II and III in the presence of a base. Any suitable solvent may be used for the reaction, for example an aromatic hydrocarbon, for example benzene or toluene. The reaction may for example be carried out at a temperature in the range of from 50 to 150 C. Conveniently, the reaction is carried out at the reflux temperature of the solvent used. The tetrahydrofuran derivative 11 may be prepared by subjecting a compound of the general formula IVEMI4.4 to ring closure by reaction with an electrophilic epoxidizing agent. Suitable electrophilic epoxidizing agents include hydrogen peroxide, alkali metal peroxides or hypohalites, metal perborates, peroxyacetyl nitrate and silver oxide. Especially suitable electrophilic epoxidising agents are peroxyacids, for example aliphatic peroxyacids such as peroxyacetic acid or peroxyformic acid, or, preferably, aromatic peroxyacids such as unsubstituted or substituted peroxybenzoic acid. Especially suitable are halogen substituted peroxybenzoic acids, for example acids in which the phenyl ring is substituted by one or two chlorine and or bromine atoms. Meta chloroperoxybenzoic acid is especially suitable. The epoxidation is suitably carried out in the presence of an inert solvent, for example a hydrocarbon, chlorinated hydrocarbon, ether or ester, such as benzene, toluene, methylene chloride, carbon tetrachloride, diethyl ether or ethyl acetate.Mixtures of solvents may be suitable. The epoxidation is preferably carried out at a temperature in the range of from 10 C to 80 C, especially 0 to 20 C. It may in some cases be convenient to carry out the reaction at the reflux temperature of the solvent used. The molar ratio of the compound of the general formula IV and the electrophilic epoxidising agent is not of critical importance. Preferably the compound of the general formula IV and the electrophilic epoxidising agent are mixed in approximately equimolar quantities, or a slight excess of the epoxidising agent is used. Preferably the molar ratio of the compound of the general formula I to the electrophilic epoxidising agent is in the range of from 1 1 to 1 2 especially 1 1 to 1 1.5. Useful yields can however be obtained using a molar ratio of up to 1 10 or higher. The compounds of the general formula IV may be prepared by methods analogous to methods known in the art. Compounds of the general formula I in which X represents aEMI5.1 group are convenient sources of other tetrahydrofuran derivatives in accordance with general rormula I since the dioxolane functional group can be readily converted to the corresponding carbonvl moietv. that is compounds of general formula I wherein X representsEMI6.1 group, by treatment with an acid. Compounds of general formula I wherein X represents aEMI6.2 group may then be converted to other compounds of general formula I by methods analogous to methods known in the art. For example, the oxime derivatives, that is compounds wherein X representsEMI6.3 may be obtained by treating the carbonyl compound with hydroxylamine hydrochloride in the presence of an organic base such as pyridine.Further, the carbonyl group may be converted to the corresponding alcohol by reaction with a suitable reducing agent, for example, lithium aluminium hydride in ether solvent.The Grignard reaction may be employed to convert the carbonyl group into an alcohol while introducing the appropriate alkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl substituents onto the carbonyl carbon atom, that is compounds according to general formula I wherein X represents aEMI6.4 group. Ifle compounds or general formula I exnlDlt nerbleloal activi ty. Therefore the invention further provides a herbicidal composition which comprises a compound of the formula I together with a suitable carrier. The invention also provides a method of combating undesired plant growth at a locus, which comprises applying to the locus a compound or a composition according to the invention. A carrier in a composition according to the invention is any material with which the active ingredient is formulated to facilitate application to the locus to be treated, which may for example be a plant, seed or soil, or to facilitate storage, transport or handling. A carrier may be a solid or a liquid, including a material which is normally gaseous but which has been compressed to form a liquid, and any of the carriers normally used in formulating herbicidal compositions may be used. Suitable solid carriers include natural and synthetic clays and silicates, for example natural silicas such as diatomaceous earths magnesium silicates, for example talcs magnesium aluminium silicates, for example attapulgites and vermiculites aluminium silicates, for example kaolinites, montmorillonites and micas calcium carbonate calcium sulphate synthetic hydrated silicon oxides and synthetic calcium or aluminium silicates elements, for example carbon and sulphur natural and synthetic resins, for example coumarone resins, polyvinyl chloride, and styrene polymers and copolymers solid polychlorophenols bitumen waxes, for example beeswax, paraffin wax, and chlorinated mineral waxes and solid fertilisers, for example superphosphates. Suitable liquid carriers include water alcohols, for example isopropanol and glycols ketones, for example acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone and cyclohexanone ethers aromatic or araliphatic hydrocarbons, for example benzene, toluene and xylene petroleum fractions, for example kerosine and light mineral oils chlorinated hydrocarbons, for example carbon tetrachloride, perchloroethylene and trichloroethane. Mixtures of different liquids are often suitable. Agricultural compositions are often formulated and trans ported in a concentrated form which is subsequently diluted by the user before application. The presence of small amounts of a carrier which is a surface active agent facilitates this process of dilution. Thus preferably at least one carrier in a composition according to the invention is a surface active agent. For example the composition may contain at least two carriers, at least one of which is a surface active agent. A surface active agent may be an emulsifying agent, a dispersing agent or a wetting agent it may be nonionic or ionic.Examples of suitable surface active agents include the sodium or calcium salts of polyacrylic acids and lignin sulphonic acids the condensation products of fatty acids or aliphatic amines or amides containing at least 12 carbon atoms in the molecule with ethylene oxide and or propylene oxide fatty acid esters of glycerol, sorbitan, sucrose or pentaerythritol condensates of these with ethylene oxide and or propylene oxide condensation products of fatty alcohol or alkyl phenols, for example octylphenol or E octylcresol, with ethylene oxide and or propylene oxide sulphates or sulphonates of these condensation products alkali or alkaline earth metal salts, preferably sodium salts, of sulphuric or sulphonic acid esters containing at least 10 carbon atoms in the molecule, for example sodium lauryl sulphate, sodium secondary alkyl sulphates, sodium salts of sulphonated castor oil, and sodium alkylaryl sulphonates such as sodium dodecylbenzene sulphonate and polymers of ethylene oxide and copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide. The compositions of the invention may for example be formulated as wettable powders, dusts, granules, solutions, emulsifiable concentrates, emulsions, suspension concentrates and aerosols. In general, such compositions may contain from 0.5 to 95 w of the active ingredient with the remainder being adjuvants conventionally employed in such compositions, that is carriers and or surface active agents. Wettable powders usually contain 25, 50 and 75 w of active ingredient and usually contain in addition to solid inert carrier, 3 10 w of a dispersing agent and, where necessary, 0 10 w of stabiliser s and or other additives such as penetrants of stickers.Dusts are usually formulated as a dust concentrate having a similar compositions to that of a wettable powder but without a dispersant, and are diluted in the field with further solid carrier to give a composition usually containing 2 10 w of active ingredient. Granules are usually prepared to have a size between 10 and 100 BS mesh 1.676 0.152 mm , and may be manufactured by agglomeration or impregnation techniques. Generally, granules will contain 2 25 w active ingredient and 0 10 w of additives such as stabilisers, slow release modifiers and binding agents. Emulsifiable concentrates usually contain, in addition to a solvent and, when necessary, co solvent, 10 50 w v active ingredient, 2 20 w v emulsifiers and 0 20 w v of other additives such as stabilisers, penetrants and corrosion inhibitors. Suspension concentrates are usually compounded so as to obtain a stable, non sedimenting flowable product and usually contain 10 75 w active ingredient, 0.5 15 w of dispersing agents, 0.1 10 w of suspending agents such as protective colloids and thixotropic agents, 0 10 w of other additives such as defoamers, corrosion inhibitors, stabilisers, penetrants and stickers, and water or an organic liquid in which the active ingredient is substantially organic liquid in which the active ingredient is substantially insoluble certain organic solids or inorganic salts may be present dissolved in the formulation to assist in preventing sedimentation or as antifreeze agents for water. Aqueous dispersions and emulsions, for example compositions obtained by diluting a wettable powder or a concentrate according to the invention with water, also lie within the scope of the present invention. The said emulsions may be of the water in oil or of the oil in water type, and may have a thick mayonnaise like consistency. The composition of the invention may also contain other ingredients, for example, other compounds possessing herbicidal, insecticidal or fungicidal properties.

The tests fall into two categories, pre emergence and postemergence. The pre emergence tests involved spraying a liquid formulation of the compound onto the soil in which the seeds of the plant species mentioned above had recently been sown. The post emergence tests involved two types of test, viz., soil drench and foliar spray tests. In the soil drench tests the soil in which the seedling plants of the above species were growing, was drenched with a liquid formulation containing a compound of the invention, and in the foliar spray tests the seedling plants were sprayed with such a formulation. The soil used in the tests was a prepared horticultural loam. The formulations used in the tests were prepared by diluting with water, solutions of the test compounds in acetone containing 0.4 by weight of an alkylphenol ethylene oxide condensate available under the trade name TRITON X 155. The acetone solutions were diluted with water and the resulting formulations applied at dosage levels corresponding to 5 kg and or 1 kg of active material per hectare in a volume equivalent to 650 litres per hectare in the soil spray and foliar spray tests, and at a dosage level equivalent to 10 kilograms of active material per hectare in a volume equivalent to approximately 3,000 litres per hectare in the soil drench tests. In the pre emergence tests untreated sown soil and in the post emergence tests untreated soil bearing seedlings plants were used as controls. The herbicidal effects of the test compounds were assessed visually eleven days after spraying the foliage and drenching the soil and twelve days after spraying the soil, and were recorded on a 0 9 scale. A rating 0 indicates growth as untreated control, a rating 9 indicates death. An increase of 1 unit on the linear scale approximates to a 10 increase in the level of effect.
