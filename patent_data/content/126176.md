## Description
This invention relates to the synthesis of wet and dry strength resins for use in the manufacture of paper, the broke of which can be easily and readily repulped. Broke is a waste product of the paper industry which, if not recovered and utilized, represents a substantial loss. It is customary to repulp the broke and reuse it in the papermaking process. Wet strength broke is difficult to repulp, and the repulping of wet strength broke is discussed by Schmalz in TAPPI, Vol. 44, pages 275 280 April 1961 . Cationic, water soluble, thermosetting resins derived by the reaction of aminopolyamides with epichlorohydrin are known wet strength resins for paper. Typical of these wet strength resins are the resins of U.S. Patent 2,926,154 to Keim derived by the reaction of epichlorohydrin and an aminopolyamide produced from a polyalkylene polyamine and a C₃ to C₁₀ saturated aliphatic dicarboxylic acid such as malonic acid, glutaric, acid, adipic acid, and the like. British patent 865,727 to Hercules Powder Co. and U.S. Patent 3,311,594 to Earle, Jr. also disclose resins derived by reaction of epichlorohydrin and an aminopolyamide derived from a C₃ to C₁₀ saturated dicarboxylic acid and N bis aminopropyl methylamine, also known as methylbisaminopropylamine. See also U.S. Patent 3,793,279 to Lipowski, U.S. Patent 3,887,510 to Chan et al., and U.S. Patent 3,891,589 to Ray Chaudhuri which disclose the use of diesters derived from C₂ to C₂₀ saturated dicarboxylic acids in the preparation of aminopolyamides which are subsequently reacted with epichlorohydrin. Further, in U.S. Patent 3,793,279 Lipowski teaches producing cationic wet strength resins by reacting certain chain extended, amineterminated base polyamides with epichlorohydrin and discloses that the broke from papers which are treated with these resins are more easily recovered than broke from paper treated with other wet strength resins such as those disclosed in U.S. Patent 2,926,154 to Keim. Lipowski also indicates that acids which decarboxylate, such as oxalic acid, are not suitable for making wet strength resins and shows that the products prepared from diethylenetriamine and oxalic acid, with or without subsequent amine termination and chain extension, do not, upon reaction with epichlorohydrin, provide cationic resins having wet strength properties. Other U.S. patents which describe cationic, thermosetting, wet strength resins for paper are 3,224,990 3,240,664 3,332,901 and 3,700,623. Now, in accordance with this invention, it has been found that the resins prepared by reacting an epihalohydrin, such as epichlorohydrin, with a polyaminopolyamide derived by the reaction of a saturated dicarboxylic acid component comprising oxalic acid or a diester of oxalic acid with methylbis 3 aminopropyl amine impart good wet strength to paper and that the paper can be repulped using relatively mild repulping conditions. Accordingly, the present invention relates to a process for preparing an aqueous solution of a water soluble, cationic thermosetting resin exhibiting high wet strength properties and providing a paper broke which is easily reworked, which process consists of reacting methylbis 3 aminopropyl amine in a mole ratio of 0,9 1 to 1,2 1 with a saturated dicarboxylic acid component wherein at least 20 mole percent of the acid component is oxalic acid or a diester of oxalic acid, whereby when the entire dicarboxylic acid component is oxalic acid, or when the acid component contains oxalic acid as well as different dicarboxylic acids or esters and the oxalic acid is added before the other dicarboxylic acid components, then said oxalic acid is added gradually to the amine over a period of time sufficient to maintain the temperature at below 150 C to prevent decomposition of the acid prior to reaction with the amine, to prepare a polyaminopolyamide containing tertiary amine groups, and then reacting the polyaminopolyamide in aqueous solution with 1 1,5 moles per mole tertiary amine of an epihalohydrin. In the preparation of the resins of this invention, a saturated dicarboxylic acid component containing oxalic acid or a diester of oxalic acid is first reacted with methylbis 3 aminopropyl amine to produce a long chain polyaminopolyamide. The preferred diesters of oxalic acid are dimethyl oxalate, diethyl oxalate, and dipropyl oxalate. Oxalic acid or its diester can make up the entire dicarboxylic acid component, or a portion of the oxalic acid or its diester up to 80 mole percent can be replaced with one or more saturated dicarboxylic acids containing at least 4 carbon atoms and preferably 4 to 8 carbon atoms or their esters. Particularly preferred are adipic and glutaric acids and the diesters derived from these acids and C₁ C₃ saturated aliphatic monohydric alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, and isopropanol. Specific examples of the preferred diesters are dimethyl adipate, diethyl adipate, dipropyl adipate, dimethyl glutarate, diethyl glutarate, and dipropyl glutarate. The methylbis 3 aminopropyl amine reactant, also refered to in the art as N bis aminopropyl methylamine, has the formula The polyaminopolyamide is then reacted in aqueous solution with an epihalohydrin to form a water soluble cationic thermosetting resin. Reaction of the dicarboxylic acid component containing oxalic acid or the diester of oxalic acid with the amine is preferably carried out neat but can also be carried out in a solution or dispersion of the reactants in a suitable solvent such as water and, alcohols. When the entire dicarboxylic acid component is oxalic acid, the acid is added gradually to the amine over a period of time sufficient to maintain the temperature at below 150 C and prevent decomposition of the acid prior to reaction with the amine. Then the temperature is raised from 150 C. to 200 C. and maintained thereat for a length of time sufficient to remove the water of polycondensation and produce a polyamide having an intrinsic viscosity of at least about 0.06. When the acid component contains oxalic acid as well as different dicarboxylic acids or esters, the oxalic acid and the different acids or esters are usually added separately to the amine. The preferred procedure involves first adding the oxalic acid to the amine while maintaining the temperature at below 150 C. and then reacting the oxalic acid with the amine prior to adding the other dicarboxylic acid s or ester s and completing the reaction. When the acid component contains the diester of oxalic acid and the diester of one or more different dicarboxylic acids, the diesters can be added separately or simultaneously. Temperatures employed in the reaction can vary between 110 C and 225 C. Preferred temperature range is 140 C to 200 C. Time of reaction depends on temperature and is inversely proportional thereto. Usually the reaction time will vary from about 1 2 to two hours. In carrying out the reaction, it is preferred to use an amount of the dicarboxylic acid component sufficient to react substantially completely with the primary amine groups of the methylbis 3 aminopropyl amine. This will usually require a mole ratio of amine to acid component of from 0.9 1 to 1.2 1. The preferred mole ratio is 1 1. In converting the polyaminopolyamide to a water soluble cationic thermosetting resin, the polyaminopolyamide is reacted in aqueous solution with epihalohydrin, preferably epichlorohydrin. The reaction is carried out in solution, using the polyaminopolyamide in the form of its water soluble acid salt in those cases where the free amine form of the polyaminopolyamide has limited water solubility. Usually the reaction is carried out at a temperature from about 40 C. to about 100 C. and preferably from about 45 C. to 85 C. until the viscosity of a 25 solids solution at 25 C. has reached about E F or higher on the Gardner Holdt scale or the Spence Spurlin viscosity is at least about 20 and preferably ranges from about 22 to about 30 seconds. The acid salt of the polyaminopolyamide is easily and readily prepared by adding to an aqueous dispersion of the polyaminopolyamide a water soluble acid such as hydrochloric acid in an amount essentially stoichiometrically equivalent to the tertiary amines of the polyaminopolyamide whereby essentially all the tertiary amines are converted to the acid salt. Suitable acids for salt formation are water soluble, are within the skill of the art, and include inorganic acids such as sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, and phosphoric acid, and organic acids such as acetic acid. In the polyaminopolyamide epihalohydrin reaction, it is preferred to use sufficient epihalohydrin to convert all tertiary amine groups to quaternary ammonium groups. Satisfactory resins can be prepared by using from 1 mole to 1.5 moles and preferably from 1.2 to 1.4 moles of epihalohydrin per mole of tertiary amine of the polyaminopolyamide. pH adjustment is usually not necessary during reaction. However, since the pH decreases during the reaction, it may be desirable in some cases to add alkali to combine with at least some of the acid formed. When the desired viscosity is reached, sufficient additional water is added to adjust the solids content of the resin solution to about 15 or less and the product cooled to room temperature, about 25 C. The resin will contain a plurality of reactive groups. The resin is preferably stabilized against premature gelation by converting essentially all the reactive groups to inactive groups, X being the halogen of the epihalohydrin and chlorine when the epihalohydrin is epichlorohydrin. The stabilization is accomplished by adding a water soluble acid to the resin solution until essentially all the reactive groups are changed to the inactive form. This is accomplished by adding sufficient water soluble acid to obtain and maintain a pH below about 3 and preferably of from about 1 to 3. The reactive groups are thereby changed to the inactive form and the resin solution will be stabilized against gelation.When the pH remains at the desired pH for a period of about one hour at room temperature about 25 C. , it is relatively certain that the pH will not change and the resin solution is stabilized against gelation. By this means, stable solutions having a resins solids content of from about 10 to about 50 can be prepared. Acids that can be employed in the above stabilization procedure are water soluble acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydrofluoric acid, hydroiodic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, and acetic acid. Mixtures of two or more water soluble acids can be used if desired. Prior to use in the paper mill, the stabilized resin is reactivated by adjusting the pH of the resin solution to and maintaining it above about 8, preferably 10.5 and higher. Preferred pH range is 10.5 to 11.7. This reconverts essentially all the inactive groups to the reactive cross linking groups. This pH adjustment is made by the addition of a suitable organic or inorganic base such as the alkali metal hydroxides and carbonates, calcium hydroxide, benzyltrimethylammonium hydroxide, and tetramethylammonium hydroxide. The alkali metals include sodium, potassium, cesium, and lithium. The base is added preferably as an aqueous solution. The polyamide epichlorohydrin resins, prepared as herein described, may be incorporated into pulp slurry at any point on the wet end of the paper machine. However, prior to use, the stabilized resin must be reactivated as above set forth to convert the halohydrin groups to epoxide groups. The resins of this invention exhibit high off the machine wet strength and moderate to high dry strength. For most purposes, adequate wet strength can be obtained by incorporating in the paper from about 0.2 to about 3 of the resin based on the dry weight of the pulp. The invention is further illustrated by the following examples which demonstrate the best known embodiments of the invention. In these examples, intrinsic viscosity I.V. measurements were determined at 25 C. on a 2 solution in 1M ammonium chloride and Brookfield viscosity measurements were determined at 25 C. using a 1 spindle at 60 r.p.m. unless otherwise indicated. A 50 50 by weight mixture of Rayonier bleached kraft pulp and Weyerhaeuser bleached hardwood kraft pulp was beaten to Canadian Standard freeness of 500 cc in a Noble and Wood cycle beater. The pulp was then adjusted to pH 7.5 with 10 NaOH and varying amounts, as specified in Table 1, based on the dry weight of pulp, of the polyaminopolyamide epichlorohydrin resin prepared in Example 1 were added. The solution of Example 1 was reactivated for use by diluting 25 grams of the solution to about 3 solids with water, and adding, with mixing, 8.6 ml of 1N sodium hydroxide and 27.8 ml of water. The resulting solution had a resin solids content of about 2 and a pH of about 11.7. The pulp was sheeted on a Noble and Wood handsheet machine to provide handsheets having a basis weight of approximately 18.144 kg per ream 278.70 m² and the resulting handsheets were wet pressed to a 33 solids content and then dried at 105 C. for 45 seconds on a steam heated drum drier to 3 4 moisture. The dry strength was tested uncured after 7 days of natural aging or cured after 30 minutes at 80 C. . The sheets tested for wet strength were soaked for two hours in distilled water. Results are listed in Table 1. Handsheets were prepared in accordance with the procedure of Example 2, using 0.9 resin based on the dry weight of the pulp. The handsheets gave a dry tensile of 387.3 uncured and 428.4 cured , and a wet tensile of 76.4 uncured and 87.5 cured kg per m at a basis weight of 18.32 kg per ream. Samples of the uncured handsheets were repulped in aqueous NaOH at a temperature of 85 C. Repulping of the paper sheets was carried out according to TAPPI Method 205 m 58 at a mixer speed of 2800 r.p.m., a pulp consistency of 1.3 , and a pH of 12. The degree of repulping fiber separation was measured and reported in integers ranging from 1 6, the integer 6 indicating substantially complete repulping. After 10 minutes, the degree of repulping was measured at 5 after 20 minutes, there was substantially complete repulping. The procedure of Example 4, Parts A and B, was repeated except that the amounts of oxalic acid and dimethylglutarate were varied.

Fifty five and eight tenths grams of the polyaminopolyamide of Part A of Example 30, 137 ml of water, and 27.4 grams of 37.3 aqueous HCl were thoroughly admixed to provide a 29.9 aqueous solution of the resulting salt, the pH of the solution being about 2. 78.8 g. of the 29.9 aqueous solution 23.55 grams, 0.1 mole, of resin solids were placed into a reaction vessel, and the pH of the solution adjusted to 7.5 with 5 molar NaOH. Epichlorohydrin, 13.89 grams 0.15 mole , was added, together with 53 ml of water, to give 25 solids. The temperature of the resulting solution, which was at room temperature about 25 C. , was raised to 48 50 C. and the viscosity of the solution monitored. When the Gardner Holdt viscosity reached E , 224 ml of water were added and the pH was adjusted to 2 with concentrated HCl.

The resin solutions of Examples 39 to 44 were activated for use using the procedure set forth in Example 2 and paper sheets were prepared using the resulting solutions and tested in accordance with the procedure of Example 2. Strength properties of the sheets are set forth in Table 14 below. Paper sheets were prepared in accordance with the method of Example 2 using an amount based on dry pulp of the resins of Examples 39, 40, 42, and 43 to provide uncured sheets of substantially equivalent wet strength. The strength properties of these sheets are set forth in Table 15. The paper sheets were repulped in aqueous NaOH at a pH of about 12 and a temperature of about 85 C.

Test results are set forth in Table 16 below. Polyamino copolyamides were prepared according to the procedures of Examples 42 44, Part A, and 0.10 mole of each of the resulting polyamino copolyamides, as its acid salt solution, was reacted with 0.125 mole of epichlorohydrin at a solids content of 25 , a pH of 8.0, and a temperature of 65 77 C. until the Gardner Holdt viscosity reached E F, after which time the resin solution was diluted with water and the pH was adjusted to 1 2 according to the general procedure of Example 39, Part B.

It is to be understood that the resin solutions prepared in accordance with this invention can be used to impart wet and dry strength to paper without first being stabilized against premature gelation followed by reactivation with base. Thus, if the resin solution is to be used promptly, there is no need to go through the stabilization and reactivation steps. However, as is usually the case, the resin solution will be stored for a period of time prior to use, during which time premature gelation can occur. Thus, it is recommended that pH adjustment to ensure against premature gelation be made during the manufacturing process. The above description and working examples are illustrative of this invention and not in limitation thereof.
