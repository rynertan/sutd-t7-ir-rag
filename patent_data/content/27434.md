# Apparatus for stamping graphic symbols on objects.

## Abstract
With the invention, graphic symbols are cold stamped on objects. Each graphic symbol letter, figure, abbreviation, etcetera is set in the stamping plane S independently of the setting of the remaining graphic symbols which jointly define, in the said plane S , a predetermined combination of sym bols. The setting of the said graphic symbols that are provided circumferentially, in relief, on corresponding, side by side, coaxial, stamping discs 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 takes place in observance of prefixed specifications programmed and real ized through electrical means 22 , 33 , 36 and 40 . Furth ermore, the graphic symbols set in the stamping plane S are orientated in a predetermined direction and are maintained stably in the said position also at the time the stamping opera tion is in progress, this making it possible to achieve, on the said object, impressions complementary to the said graphic symbols that are clear and are identical in orientation.

## Description
Apparatus for stamping graphic s3Tmbols on objectsThe invention relates to an apparatus for stamping generally cold graphic symbols on objects.As is known, on certain mass produced objects such as keys, spare parts for motor cars, etcetera corresponding combinations of graphic symbols such as figures, special abbreviations, letters , etcetera are cold stamped in order to establish a biunivocal correspondence transferred on to punched cards or in special tabulations between the object and the relevant combination. This makes it possible to trace with ease a given object and to either locate it in the stores or to make an identical one.In the apparatus known to date for the above mentioned function, it is envisaged that there be a number of stamping discs, side by side, coaxial and of identical diameter, each disc having circumferentially, in relief, a plurality of the aforementioned graphic symbols, usually equidistant.According to a first form of embodiment, in order to set up, in each disc, the graphic symbol on the stamping plane, the said disc is made manually to rotate intermittently and, after a rotation has been effected corresponding to one or more clicks, the disc is stabilized under the action of elastic means.In a second form of embodiment, the aforementioned discs constitute the wheels of a for example decimal numbering device, wherein for the figure in respect of tens, the wheel defining units has to undergo multiples of ten turns for the figure in respect of hundreds, the wheel defining tens has to undergo multiples of ten turns, and so on and so forth for the figure in respect of thousands and tens of thousands, etcetera.Both of the above mentioned forms of embodiment are acceptable only when the combination of graphic symbols to be stamped is always the same, and are not suitable to be utilized in cases when frequent variations of the said combination are required unless very low productivity can be tolerated, that is to say, limited stamping operations performed in the unit of time . Another negative aspect of the known apparatus is a consequence of the fact that they are not suitable for inclusion in an automatic cycle for the production of given objects such as keys that is connected to a programme control unit.The object of the invention is to make available an apparatus for stamping graphic syabolsvon objects, wherein the relevant stamping discs, on which the said graphic symbols are circumferentially in relief, are operated independently one of the other though synchronously through the medium of electromechanical means whose actuation is dependent on an electronic programme control unit.A further object of the invention is to provide an apparatus such as to ensure the programmed combination of sym bols being respected for the graphic symbols present on the stamping plane, that they are side by side, and that their orientation in a predetermined direction be maintained at the time of the stamp.ing operation.The aforementioned objects are attained with the. t echni.cal solution employed in the invention comprising an apparatus for stamping graphic symbols on objects, essential features of which are that it comprises at least one stamping disc that protrudes partially from a window in the casing that carries rotatably the shaft supporting the said disc, provided circumferentially with lands, on each of which there are, in relief, corresponding graphic symbols mechanical means for carrying the said disc in rotation means for locking the said mechanical means and the said disc, provided to stabilize the latter in a plurality of conSigurat ions, each of which positions one land provided in that part of the stamping disc that protrudes from the said window , in a stamping plane and electrical means for intermittently powering the said mechanical means in order to position a programmed graphic symbol in the stamping plane.In order to emphasize further characteristics and advantages of the apparatus in question, a description is given hereinafter of the best form of embodiment, and to understand this adequately reference should be made to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a lateral view of the apparatus according to the invention, wherein certain parts are removed and others have been shown in broken lines Fig. 2 is a view of the section A A in Fig. 1 Fig. 3 is a constructional detail in respect of the mech anism of the stamping discs Fig. 4 is the constructional detail B in Fig. 2 Fig. 5 is a possible block diagram for the electrical means connected to the said apparatus.With reference to the above mentioned figures, at 1 there is a shaft, carriedsby the casing 2 of the apparatus in question, on which are nounted idly six stamping discs 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 that are identical one with the other and protrude partially from a window 9 made in the bottom of the casing. Provision is made for each of the aforementioned stamping discs to have means for carrying them in rotation, powering them and locking them, and a programme control unit 40 is also provided. Thus, in the text that follows, reference will be made prevalently just to one stamping disc disc 7 , for example. Niche said disc 7 has peripherally a toothing 10 , the spaces 10a and the teeth 1Ob , made in accordance with the known art. The said toothing is devoid , for example, of ten spaces 10a that define a similar number of lands 11 distributed in a regular fashion over the said toothing.Each of the said lands has, in relief, on its external surface, a corresponding graphic symbol, for example an arabic numerals. It thues ensues that with the said ten lands it is possible to have available the ten arabic numerals, from nought to nine.The said disc 7 has, on one side, an enlargement 7a delimitated circumferentially by a surface 7b of circular extension in which there are ten recesses, or housings, 12 , the extension of which is curvilinear, each of which is symmetrical with respect to a radial plane. Each of the said housings 12 is shaped in such a way as to have SR2çnT inserted therein the extremity 13a of an arm, or lever, 13 pivoted at 14 to the casing 2 and subjected, furthermore, at one of its intermediate points, to the action of a flexible tongue 15 . The enlargement to which prior reference has been made, positions a corresponding land 11 with respect to a stamping plane S more precisely, the surface of the land 11 that bears in relief the relevant arabic numeral, is positioned in a stamping plane S .The toothing 10 of the disc 7 meshes with the toothing 16 of an idle wheel 17 obviously devoid of teeth 16a at a point corresponding to where there is an absence of the spaces 10a that is carried in rotation by a gear wheel 18 keyed to a shaft 19 . A unitary velocity ratio exists between the gear wheel 18 and the disc 7 . Drilled axially in one extremity 19a of the shaft 19 there is a dead hole 20 in which is freely inserted the extremity 21a of the shaft 21 of an electric motor 22 of a known type for example, a d.c. motor, a stepping motor, etcetera . The inter connection of the shafts 19 and 21 is achieved through known means shown globally at 23 .The aforementioned extremity 19a is externally of truncated cone shape so that it can accept, coupled thereto, a complementary hole, in the form of a frustrum of a cone, provided axially in a wheel 24 . The said coupling is rendered perfect by a locking bush 25 that screw meshes with the said extremity 19a that is also threaded .Circumferentially, the wheel 24 has a star shaped toothing 26 that defines ten equidistant housings 27 the number of the said housings being identical to that of the housings 12 provided in the corresponding stamping disc 7 . In one or the other of the said housings 27 is inserted a roller 28 rotatably supported at the extremity 29a of an arm 29 see Fig. 4 . The other extremity 29b of the said arm is pivotally connected at 30 to the casing 2 . The insertion of the roller 28 in one of the said housings 27 is done snap in fashion under the elastic action of a flexible strip 31 that is locked at one extremity 31a to the casing 2 and presses with its other extremity against the arm 29 .The snap in insertion of the roller 28 in a housing 27 is synchronous with the snap in insertion into a housing 12 of the extremity 13a of the arum 13 . The aforementioned synchronous insertions cooperate in positioning the corresponding land 11 in the stamping plane S .To the extremity 21b of the shaft 21 is keyed, using fixing means 32 of a known type, a drum 33 also known as an encoder . The extremity 33a of the said drum is open in such a way as to allow its circular wall 33b to pass in a slit 34 .The wall 33b hasin it, along directions parallel to the axis of the said drum, at least ten non illustrated combinations of holes no holes, each of which defines, in binary logic, a corresponding arabic numeral provided in one land of the stamping disc 7 .Placed in the window 34 , in an opposite position, there are means 35 of a known type for emitting electromag netic radiation, and means 36 of a known type for receiving the above mentioned radiation, the latter being set up to read the aforementioned combinations of holes no holes.The electrical signal or first electrical signal V1 present in the output of the receiving means 36 is sent to a comparator 37 in which in a first version of the programme control unit 40 the said signal is compared with the electrical signal or second electrical signal V2 forthcoming from a pushbutton panel 38 of a known type provided to manually programme the figure to be positioned in the stamping plane.The signal or third electrical signal V3 present in the output of the comparator 38 is sent to a block 39 which, compatibly with the sign of the signal V3 that can be deduced in accordance with known systems from the binary logic of the said signal , renders power means 43 able to emit an output signal or fourth electrical signal T4 of the digital type, the value of which is such as to cause the motor 22 to rotate in the direction F1 and in the opposite direction F2. The rotation of the motor ceases V4 o once the binary combination read by the receiving means 36 coincides with the binary combination set with the pushbutton panel 38 .All this is equivalent to positioning in the stamping plane S the arabic numeral programmed with the pushbutton panel 38 .In a second version of the programme control unit 40 , the first electrical signal V1 is compared in binary logic with a signal or fifth electrical signal V5 present in the output of a block 41 constituted for example by shift registers of a known type actuated by means of a tape reader 42 of a known type utilized for the automatic insertion of data.As is known, the de energizing of the motor 22 is not followed because of the inertia of the rotating masses by the immediate halting of the shaft 21 , which could prevent the land 11 from being positioned optimally in the stamping plane S . Such a thing is prevented because of the synchronous snap in insertion of the roller 28 in a corresponding housing 27 and of the extremity 13a of the arm 13 in a corresponding housing 12 since the inertia of the rotating masses of the motor 22 is not sufficient with the motor obviously de energized to overcome the elastic reaction of the strip 31 and of the tongue 15 .To recapitulate what has been stated above, the stamping plane S has in it the land 11 that bears in relief the arabic numeral programmed either by means of the pushbutton panel 38 or through the tape reader 42 . This is certainly achieved when the receiving means 36 read on the encoder 33 the binary combination that coincides with the binary combination prograraed as above, which corresponds to an univocal positioning of the disc 7 and involves, for the latter, the presence in the stamped ing plane S of the land that bears the programmed arabic numeral.The obtainment of the said positioning is assisted, as already pointed out, by the synchronous snap in insertion of the wheel 28 in a housing 27 and of the extremity 13a in a housing 12 .What has been described for the disc 7 takes place likewise but independently not necessarily at different times also for the remaining discs 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 and 8 , and thus six lands, side by side in the direction parallel to the axis of the shaft 1 , are present in the stamping plane S .Not only do the extremities 13a have the task of stabilicing the lands in the stamping plane but they carry out the important function of also maintaining the said positioning at the time the stamping operation is being performed which, as is known, is realized through the movement of the said apparatus this movement being achieved by a press to which the saidapparatus is fixed towards the surface of a given object destined to have the combination stamped on it. The above described apparatus satisfies in full the objects outlined in the premise hereto. It is, in fact, possible to automatically set the number to be stamped and, furthermore, principally because of the presence of the locking arm 13 , the lands present in the stamping plane are perfectly siae by siae and stable in the said position, and thus the impression transferred to a corresponding surface, as a consequence of the stamping operation, will be clear and will be made up of figures that are not staggered one with respect to the other. Another advantage the apparatus in question has to offer is in consequence of the utilization of stamping discs that are constituted by an ordinary gear wheel in which the lands that bear, in relief, the figures to be stamped are defined by the ansence of the appropriate number of spaces in the toothing of the said gear wheel.It is understood that the foregoing description has been given purely as an unlimited example, and thus that variations of a practical constructional nature can be considered without this constituting a limitation to the technical solution described above and claimed hereinafter.
