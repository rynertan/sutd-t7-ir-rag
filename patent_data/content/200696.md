The inside form of the sleeve 1 is such that when the rods 3, 5 are combined to a mutual threaded engagement the sleeve 1 can be axially fitted to the overlapping area of the combined rods 3, 5 . The inside dimension of the sleeve 1 is such that is makes separation of the rods 3, 5 in their position fitted on the overlapping area impossible as well as elimination of the mutal thread engagement. The sleeve 1 enables a rapid, simple and reliable joining of rods 3, 5 provided with threads with a free choice of the length of the overlapping area.
