## Description
This invention relates to new liquid crystal compounds and to liquid crystal compositions containing the same, particularly smectic liquid crystal compositions. The liquid crystal compounds herein include those compounds which are useful as a component of liquid crystal compositions even though they do not exist in the form of liquid crystal. Twisted nematic TN and dynamic scatter DS types, both employing nematic liquid crystal cells, are the modes of liquid crystal display most extensively used at present. One disadvantage of conventional nematic liquid crystal cells is low response speeds on the order of milliseconds at the highest , which limit the use of this type of liquid crystal cells. It has recently been found that higher response speeds can be achieved by smectic liquid crystal cells and that some of optically active smectic compounds are ferroelectricity. The ferroelectric liquid crystals are a group of compounds which are ferroelectricity when they exist as chiral smectic C hereinafter abbreviated as SmC phase and are typified by 2 methylbutyl 4 4 n decyloxybenzylideneamino cinnamate hereinafter abbreviated as DOBAMBC of the following structural formula J. Physique, More recently N. A. Clark et al. Appl. Phys. Lett., DOBAMBC remains ferroelectric only within a relatively narrow temperature range, and is unsatisfactory in physical and chemical stability because it is a Schiff base. Hence there has been a great demand for new ferroelectric compounds which are stable both physically and chemically, remain ferroelectric over a wide temperature range, have large dielectric constant, and can be driven at a low voltage.

The drawing is the graphical representation of the relationship between the temperatures and the dielectric constant values of embodiments of the liquid crystal compound, s,s 1 chloro 2 methylbutylcarbonyloxybenzoic acid 4 4 heptylcarbonyloxyphenyl phenyl ester. Preferred compounds of the invention are The present invention also provides a liquid crystal composition containing a smectic liquid crystal compound represented by any of the general formulae given above. In the present specification, a smectic liquid crystal compound is defined as a compound which shows a smectic A phase, a chiral smectic C phase, or any smectic phase under appropriate conditions and a compound which does not show a smectic phase itself, but emerges in a desirable temperature range for a chiral smectic C phase when mixed with another smectic liquid compound. An aspect of the present invention is a liquid crystal composition which is the composition of at least two liquid crystal components, for example a composition 2s,3s 4 4 2 chloro 3 methylpentyloxycarbonyl phenyl phenyl 4 octyloxybenzoic acid ester and 2s,3s 2 chloro 3 methylpentyl 4 4 nonylcarbonyloxy phenyl benzoic acid ester 28 72 shows a chiral smectic C phase at the range of 8 52 C. If the compound of the formula 1 does not show a chiral smectic phase itself, it is useful for a dopant of ferroelectric liquid crystal because of having optically active group in the compound. As mentioned supra, many ferroelectric liquid crystals are known, but ferroelectric liquid crystal which is stable and show a large spontaneous polarization up to 210 nC cm² is not yet known. The smectic liquid compound of the present invention is stable, because the structure has at least a biphenyl group unlike such compound as DOBAMBC whose two benzene rings are linked together by an unstable Shiff base functional group. The smectic liquid crystal compounds of the invention exhibit high spontaneous polarization in the chiral smectic C phase, because they have an optically active group. One of the compound of formula 2 can be presented according to the following steps wherein R₁ represents a straight or branched C The compound presented by a general formula 2 has at least an optically active group and shows ferroelectricity. Optically active group is derived easily from following compounds such as optically active alcohols or carboxylic acids Some of the optically active alcohols just mentioned can be easily prepared by asymmetric reduction of corresponding ketones by the action of special metal catalysts, or by microbial or enzymic action. Some other optically active acids and alcohols may be derived from optically active amino acids or oxy acids which are found in nature or obtainable by optical resolution, such as valine, leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, threonine, homoserine, allo isoleucine, tert leucine, 2 aminobutyric acid, norvaline, norleucine, ornitine, lysine, hydroxylysine, phenylglycine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, mandelic acid, tropic acid, 3 hyroxybutyric acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, and isopropylmalic acid.
