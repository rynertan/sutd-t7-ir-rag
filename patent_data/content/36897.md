## Description
This invention relates to a control device, par ti tilarly for reciprocating those grinders which, in shuttleless looms are to insert the weft thread. As is mown, in shuttleless looms, the weft e thread is inserted by means of two suitably designed grippers sometimes called needles or darts, den ending on their different shapes . During the long standstill phase of the comb and related opening of the shed, the two gri ters, vhich are carried cantilever fashion by the respective sides of the loom, are first moved to ward each other, starting from such sides, and then, after meeting at the center of the loom and handing over the weft thread, returned to the loom sides to allow the comb beating up. Also known are shuttleless looms wherein each such grippes is secured at one end to a respective flexible belt, arranged to slide in a sort of arcuate guidee The two arcuate guides extend in a vertical plane lying parallel to the loom front and project out of said sides, and sometimes depend downwards from the loom, such as not to interfere with the oscillations of the sley to which the comb is mounted.Moreover, each belt is provided with a lengthwise series of slots, in mesh engagement with the teeth of a re spective gear or toothed wheel which is driven to recinrocato rotatively in either directions, thereby the belt is nioved out of the guide and the related gripper is brought to the loom center, and viceversa, the belt is withdrawn and the gripper moved back. Numerous are the aspects of the tes S control utilized in the past for such gear wheels which have failed to prove fully satisfactory. For example, with the currently employed controls, the belts of the weft inserting gri ners do not have sufficiently low speeds and accelerations to ensure, at the gripper travel limit corresnonding to the loom center, a correct transfer of the weft thread from one grippes to the other. Furthermore the bulk size of the looms is con siderable, and so are the travel sections covered by the grnppers during their return stroke after leaving the reed. Other drawbacks are due to the conventional controls being less than entirely suitable for aSplica tion to looms having, within a certain range, a front of different useful extension This invention sets out to obviate the cited shortcomings. According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a control device for the reoiprocat ing movement of the transmission systems carrying the weft thread insertion grippers in shuttleless looms, wherein each transmission system is driven by a re respective gear wheel, characterized in that it comprises between at least one of said gear wheels and a counect√ß ing rod and crank assembly driven by a cyclic shaft of the shuttleless loom,an oscillating gear sector, driving said gear wheel,said gear sector having substantially along the bisecting line thereof a oleo ted link type coupling including a slider said coupling providing ar ticulation both with an end of a linkage member of said coniiecti n rod and crank assembly and with a pin of a rocker arm following the osci ,latjon of said gear sector, thereby to guide the movement of said linkage member end Further features will be more clearly apparent from the description of a preferred, though not limitative, embodiment of this control, illustrated by way of example only in the accompanying drawing, where Figure 1 is a diagrammatical partial front view of a shuttleless loom Figure 2 is a detail view of a control according to this inventions as viewed from one side of the loom and Figure 3 is a partly sectional plan view of the control shown in Figure 2, as taken along the lineIII III of Figure 2. With reference to the drawing figures, the nuneral 1 designates the reed of a shuttleless loom. A lower reinforcement 2 of the reed is attached to a sley, not shown, which can be oscillated, in a known manner, about a horizontal axis extending parallel to the loom front and being located between the two sides of the same. Parallel to each such side there extend a respective pair of vertical elements 3, which are also connected to that side externally thereto On the front, the reinforcement 2 has E threshold 2a, which is covered by a special gasket and upon which two grippers 4 and 5 are arranged to slide, which grippers are attached each to the top end of a respective belt 6.The grippers 4 and 5 serve for inserting the weft thread the gripper 4 can be, for example, the one intended for picking up the weft thread, or pulling grippes, whilst the gripper 5 can fulfill the function of inserting and deliver the weft thread to the preceding gripper. The belts 6 are flexible and arranged for sliding in a sort of guides or sheathes 7, which extend in a common plane parallel to the loom front. Start ing from its top end, contiguous to a respective end of the reed 1, each guide 7 has a rectilinear section or portion which, outside of the related loom side, extends dovaiwards into an arcuate section or portion, which may be terminated with a lower or bottom rectilinear section facing the loom center. The belts 6 are flattened horizontally, parallel to the loom sides. Each belt is provided with a lengthwise series of slots which are distributed at regular intervals. With the slots in one series, there mesh engages a gear or toothed wheel 8 which is keyed to one end of a related shaft 9. Each. shaft 9 is carried pivotally by a bearing 10 which is laid horizontal and parallel to the vertical elements 3 in the proximity of the top end of the respective guide 7, through which passes the wheel 8 to mesh with the related belt 6. At the end of each shaft 9 remote from the gear wheel 8, there is keyed a bevel pinion gear 11 which meshes with.a portion of a bevel gear 12a, secured to a sector 1 2be Each toothed sector or gear segment 12a b is journalled between the respective pair of vertical elements 3 it is, in fact, secured to a pin 13 which is carried pivotally by said vertical ele ments 3 and is perpendicular thereto, The pair of vertical elements 3 also carries a second pin 14, parallel and coplanar with the pin 13 but located, with respect to the pin 13, on the side remote from the wheel 8. The second pin 14 acts as the pivot for a rocker arm 15.In particular, the second pin 14 has an eccentric portion 14a which acquires variable distance from the pin 13 depending on the angular position in which the second pin 14 is locked with respect to the vertical elements 3w With the interposition of a bushing, the rocker arm 15 is mounted pivotally to the portion 14a, thereby its pivot is at an adjustable distance from the portion 13 of the gear sector 12a b. To the terminating pin 17 of the rocker arm 15 there articulate the small end of a connecting rod 18 and a slider 19, which is slot linked at 20 to the sector 12b, the slot link extending along the bisect ing line of said sector. Thus, the rocker arm 15 follows the oscillations of the gear sector 12a b in the same direction. The big end of the connecting rod 18 is articulated to a second pin 21 of a crank 22 which is keyed to one end of a shaft 23. The shaft 239 extending parallel to the loom front and located between the sides of the same, is driven to complete one revolution per cycle of the loom.The crank mechanisms 22 18, located at the ends of the shaft 23 and being driven thereby, convert the rotary motion t of the shaft 23 into a reciprocating movement of the respective gear sectors 12a b and respective wheels 8, such that while one wheel turns in one direction the other turns in the opposite direction. The control described in the foregoing operates as follows. When the reed 1 is at a standstill in the posi tion where its lower reinforcement is aligned with the top sections of the guides 7 the belts 6 are controlled to move out of the same and insert the grippers 4 and 5 through the warp thread shed. The gnDpers reach as far as the center of the loom, and the gripper 5 delivers the weft thread to the gripper 4. At this stage, the wheels 8 reverse their rqtations and control the belts 6 to move back into the guides 7, thereby the grippers are withdrawn. As the grippers withdraw from the reed 2, the reed rapidly completes its oscillation to beat in the weft inserted in the fabric and then returns to its condition in align ment with the top sections of the guides 7.The simultaneous engagement of the slotted link 20 of the sector 12b by the rocker arm 15 and cocoa 18 of the crank mechanism, as driven by the cyclic shaft 23, produces the aforesaid favourable laws of motion of the grippers 4 and 5 at their end of stroke posi tions, respectively at the center and sides of the loom. It should be observed that these favourable laws of motion are detera ined by the fact that, whereas in the position indicated in Figure 2 of the pin 17 a material point of the sector 12b lying at the considered moment on the axis of the pin 17 is moved subsequently along a path coinciding with the circular arc h the radius of which convergcs towards the center of the pin 13, instead the pin 17 itself is moved subsequently to the considered moment along a path coinciding with the circular arc 3 the radius of which converges towards the center of the pivot 14a and is theref ore greater than the radius of the circular arc A.Consequently near the two dead points of the oscillation of the sector 12b the law of motion is determined by the greater radius of the circular arc 3 so that on the one hand there is obtained a reduction of the stroke of the grippers, which otherwise would have been greater, and on the other side a variation of the speed and of the accelerations is obtained during the stroke, which variations favour the gripping and the releasing action of the weft performed by the grippes. It should be further noted that the adjustment of the angular position of the pin 14 , and accordi n ly of the distance of the pivot 14a of the rocker arm 15 from the pivot 13 of the gear sector 12a b, affords the possibility of using one and the same control even though the useful width of the loom zy vary within limits. Thus, the invention as described achieved its obJects. In practicing the invention, all of the details may be replaced with other technically equivalent ones without departing from the inventions scope.
