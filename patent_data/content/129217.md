## Description
The present invention relates to a semiconductor circuit including a memory and a pulse drive circuit. Reductions in the sustain voltage of elements which have resulted from the recent miniaturization of bipolar or MOS transistors have tended to reduce the operating voltages of integrated circuits. From the user s point of view, conventional supply voltages, such as supply voltages in units of 5V, are desirable for ease of use. It is considered that means by which it will be possible to satisfy both the needs of the manufacturers of integrated circuits and the users is a reduction of the external supply voltage Vcc within the chips and the operation of miniaturized elements by a voltage V Figure 1A is taken from EP A 0 063 483. A miniaturized element 12a of Fig. 1B is used in an internal circuit A chip is a single substrate on which memory, logic or other LSI devices are fabricated. In a memory LSI device, When this kind of voltage limiter system is utilized for charging a capacitance load which has only a low voltage resistance in the circuit In Fig. 2, a precharge circuit for a data line of a semiconductor memory is shown as an example of this type of circuit. In Fig. 2, charging transistors Q₆, Q₇ controlled by precharge pulse However, in this circuit, the equivalent internal resistance of the voltage limiter 30 is connected in series to the equivalent resistances of the charging transistors Q₆ or Q₇ when they are on, and thus it is necessary to make these resistances much smaller to enable charging at a higher speed when there is a larger capacitance load. For that purpose, size of the transistors in the voltage limiter 30 and the transistors Q₆, Q₇ must be larger, and thus it can be understood that it is difficult to drive a large capacitance load faster when there must be a high degree of integration. US A 4 065 678 discloses a pulse driver circuit which produces a limited output voltage from a given supply voltage. This document represents a semiconductor circuit in accordance with the first part of claim 1. It is an object of the invention to apply such a pulse drive circuit to a semiconductor memory, the data lines of which represent a large capacitance, yet are pre charged at high speed to a voltage lower than the supply voltage. The present invention meets this object by providing a semiconductor circuit as characterized in claim 1. Preferred embodiments of the pulse drive circuit and semiconductor memory included in this semiconductor circuit are set forth in the dependent claims. Fig. 3 shows a fundamental circuit. A signal The pulse generating circuit PG inputs pulse Details of this pulse generating circuit PG and its operation are given in Electronics March 24th, 1982, pp. 132 136. An outline thereof is provided below. An inverted output of a driver 12 to which the input pulse An internal supply voltage V The external supply voltage Vcc is applied to the drain of transistor Q Thus for V Fig. 4 discloses a circuit in which the voltage of V V₀ is equal to the external supply voltage when the n series connected diodes D₁ to D Returning to Fig. 4, a high voltage generation circuit 31 generates a voltage V In Fig. 4, two transistor Q₁₀₃, Q₁₀₁, which are arranged so that the drain and gate of one are connected to the source of the other, and a resistance R The high voltage generation circuit 31 will now be described with reference to the circuit diagram thereof of Fig. 6A. A circuit C Since the high voltage generation circuit 31 receives the charges of the capacitors CB, C B output during both time bands T₁, T₂, the ability of the circuit to supply charge is great, and a ripple noise in its output V Fig. 7 shows a circuit which can charge the capacitance load C The gate voltage of the transistor Q₁₀₃ is made to be V In addition, the high voltage generation circuit 31B supplies the transistor Q The output V Ordinary integrated circuits are subjected to ageing tests after the final production step in order to ensure their reliability. These ageing tests are designed to detect any transistor in which basic problems are likely to occur because of a failure of its gate oxide film, and are performed by deliberately applying to each transistor in the circuit a voltage which is higher than those encountered during normal usage. It is necessary to apply to each element a voltage which is slightly lower than the destructive voltage of a normal element in order to improve the chances of finding failures with these ageing tests. For an integrated circuit chip which is so constructed that a supply voltage is supplied through a voltage limiter within the chip, examples which can accomplish these ageing tests, even for the circuit part In the circuits shown in Figs. 3, 4 and 7, the voltage limiter 30 varies the output voltage V However, when Vcc is near the normal operating voltage 5V, it is better not to change V Fig. 9 shows a circuit in which the capacitance load C Fig. 9 differs from Fig. 7 in that a voltage limiter 30D is used instead of the voltage limiter 30 of Fig. 7. The circuit of the voltage limiter 30D is disclosed in EP A 0 063 483. This voltage limiter 30D outputs a voltage V When the external supply voltage Vcc is above V 0, a transistor Q ℓ is turned on because transistors Q 1 and Q n are on. Consequently, the output is defined by a gradient m m m which is also determined by the ratio of conductance of transistors Q The circuit shown in Fig. 9 differs from that of Fig. 7 in that a high voltage V The voltage V The high voltage generation circuit 31C will now be described. A pulse generating circuit PG , shown in Fig.10A, differs from the pulse generating circuit PG of Fig. 3 only in that it does not have the transistor Q The operation of this voltage generation circuit 31C will now be described with reference to Fig. 10B. An output V This means that the high voltage generation circuits 31A and 31B can be constructed of the same circuit. Figs. 11A and 11B show an embodiment of the present invention applied to MOS dynamic memory with a single transistor type memory cell. In these drawings, a group of circuits 1 enclosed within a dot dash line comprise a memory array circuit. A group of circuits 2 enclosed within a dot dot dash line comprise circuits direct peripheral circuits which control the memory array circuit and amplify signals from memory cells. A group of circuits 3 enclosed within a triple dot dash line denotes circuits indirect peripheral circuits which supply signals to the direct peripheral circuits, amplify memory signals from the memory array circuit, and write memory signals into the memory array circuit. In the memory array 1, capacitors C₁ and C₂, transistors Q₈, Q₉ and Q₁₁, Q₁₀ represent dummy cells. Capacitors CM₁, CM₂...CM A denotes a word driver circuit which generates word selecting signals from address signals. When a transistor QD₁ or QD₂ on a word line W₁ or W₂, respectively, is selected, the word driver circuit A raises the gate voltage of a transistor Q₁₆ on a dummy word line WD₁ to a higher level, and outputs a signal On the other hand, when a transistor QD Transistors Q₂₁, Q₂₂ connect I 0 and Transistors Q₁, Q₂ form part of a sense amplifier and transistors Q₃, Q₄ act as switches to connect data lines to the sense amplifier. Transistors Q₆, Q₇ are used for precharging and will be described later. A transistor Q₅ is used for switching between the short circuiting of data lines D, A transistor Q₁₈ is used for precharging a line ℓ, and transistors Q₁₉, Q₂₀ are used for driving the sense amplifier. A voltage limiter 30E outputs two voltages V Each transistor is constructed so as to have a threshold voltage V The voltage limiter 30E can generate these two voltage magnitudes within a single circuit. Thus, the area of the semiconductor chip can be reduced, and fluctuations between V In Fig. 11B, F denotes a circuit in which is inputted a precharge signal The data lines D, For example when the external supply voltage Vcc is 5V and the threshold voltage is 0.5V, the precharge voltage is 3.5V. Since there are numerous data lines within a memory, the total capacitance thereof is fairly large. However, according to the present invention, these lines can be precharged to a voltage which is lower than Vcc at high speed. In order to prevent any differences in data line voltages caused by the difference between the threshold voltages of transistors Q₆ and Q₇, the gate voltage I O, In Fig. 11B, B denotes a pulse generating circuit and C denotes another pulse generating circuit which inputs write data Din and generate pulses din, Numeral 33 denotes a circuit which inputs external control pulse signals at the voltage Vcc and generates pulses such as In Fig. 11B, G denotes a circuit which is inputed a signal In this embodiment, the pulse drive circuit is not applied to the driving circuit G for word lines W₁ ... W In Fig. 11B, H denotes a voltage converter circuit which is inputed V In order to precharge the I O, Circuits for discharging the capacitance load are shown in Figs. 15 and 16. Fig. 15 shows a circuit in which a signal Fig. 16 shows a circuit in which a push pull type of buffer circuit is constructed from two of the pulse generating circuits PG of Fig. 3 which form an inverted signal and apply it and the original signal to the gates of transistors Q Each of these circuits have been described using n channel MOS transistors as examples, but p channel MOS transistors can be employed of all the potential relationships are reversed. For example, if p channel MOS transistors are used for the pulse generating circuit and the supply voltage is 5V the circuit operates within the range of 5V to OV , the circuit can be operate under conditions in which 5V is applied to the drain of transistor Q When this discharge circuit is used together with the voltage limiter 30 with the characteristics of Figs. 4 and 9, the following effect is obtained, in the same way as in the charging circuit of Fig. 3. The amplitude of the voltage of the pulse signal applied to the gates of the transistors Q For example, in the transistor type of dynamic memory shown in Figs. 11A and 11B, even when the external supply voltage Vcc is varied in order to stabilize the memory operations between the memory array 1 and the direct peripheral circuits 2 and the indirect peripheral circuits 3, it is necessary to maintain the matching between the operating speeds of each of the circuits. However, when not using a voltage limiter having a characteristic such as that of Figs. 5 and 8, in which the gradient m is controlled so that it is less than the variation in the external supply voltage Vcc, the operating speed depends on the operating and manufacturing conditions because each circuit has a different operating mode, so that it is difficult to maintain this matching. In particular in recent years, the wiring resistances within the memory array circuit 1, the direct peripheral circuits 2, etc., have increased because of the increased integration of memories, and also the characteristics of MOS transistors make it more difficult to match them to the circuits which determine the operating speed. This problem is very important, particularly when the external supply voltage Vcc varies. Fig. 17 illustrates this state, with reference to an example in which a signal 101a must be generated when the waveform of a signal 100a has fallen below the voltage V In contrast, if an attempt is made to reduce the delay in the generation of the signal waveform 101b when the external supply voltage Vcc is low, the signal waveform 101b is generated earlier than that when the signal waveform 100b reaches V Thus, if one of the circuits shown in Figs. 9, 15 and 16 is employed as a circuit controlling the delay in the signal waveform 101, the delay in the generation of the signal waveform due to variations in the external supply voltage Vcc can be elminated. This means that, since variations in the voltage output by the voltage limiter 30 are smaller than those in the external supply voltage Vcc, and the operating speeds of the transistors Q Accordingly, it is possible to realize a memory which can operate stably with no delaying in its access time. The memories of Figs. 11A and 11B have been described by way of example, but this method can be applied to any other type of memory with the same objectives, without any modification. As stated above, details of the present invention have been given in accordance with an embodiment thereof, but the potential application of the present invention should not be limited to these embodiments.
