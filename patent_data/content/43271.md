# Method and apparatus for cooling film bubble of low strain hardening polymers.

## Abstract
A process and apparatus are disclosed for forming blown film of a low strain hardening polymer, such as a low pressure polymerized low density ethylene copolymer, in cluding an improved film bubble cooling technique which permits high production rates to be achieved with good film bubble stability. The disclosed process comprises cooling a molten film bubble by contacting the outside of the film bubble with separate annular streams of cooling fluid fed through at least two stacked annular cooling rings disposed around the film bubble, wherein all or substantially all of the cooling fluid exits the system though a common plane formed by the last cooling ring. The disclosed apparatus comprises means 11 for forming a molten film bubble 10 and means for cooling same including at least two separate annular cooling rings 13,14 disposed around the bubble, each provided with means for feeding an annular cooling fluid stream against the bubble and further including means 15 whereby all or substantially all of said cooling fluid exits the system through a common plane formed by the last cooling ring.
