# Method for producing semiconductor devices including the use of reactive ion etching.

## Abstract
The method comprises blanket depositing a layer of a first material on a semiconductor structure, on the surface of which protruding regions 34A have been formed border ing with a vertical wall 40 on adjacent areas, and subse quently removing completely or selectively that layer by reactive ion etching where prior to the deposition of said layer the vertical wall 40 is reshaped either by removing material from that wall 40 or by accumulating a second material on said wall 40 . The method prevents that uncontrolled residues of ma terials like a doped polysilicon after reactive ion etching steps. These residues might be detrimental to devices and elements, like transistors and resistors formed in the semi conductor substrate.
