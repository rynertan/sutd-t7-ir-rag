# JAW CRUSHER FOR BULKY WASTE AND LIKE MATTER

## Abstract
The invention relates to a jaw crusher for bulky waste and like matter, comprising two groups 2, 3 of jaws or shanks being movable towards and away from each other, the jaws or shanks within each group being placed at an interval corresponding to the width of the jaws or shanks of the opposite group, the jaws or shanks of one group being adapted, as they move towards the other group, to travel at least partly into the interspace between the jaws or shanks of the opposite group, and including driving units actuating at least one group of jaws or shanks in order to move them towards the opposite group. The novel feature resides therein, that at least one 5 of the jaws included in at least one group 2 of jaws is movable relative to the remaining jaws 4, 6 of the same group, that the jaws are individually movable by individually actuable driving units 12 15 , and that said driving units are provided with means sensing exerted power and actuating a programmable central unit which secures that the relative position of the jaws will vary during the cutting up operation.
