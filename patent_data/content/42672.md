# Machine for performing a roughing operation progressively along marginal portions of shoe bottoms.

## Abstract
Machine for performing a progressive roughing opera tion on shoe bottoms has a three axis computer controlled stepping motor arrangement 144, 84, 122 for moving two rotary radial roughing tools 168 along a predetermined path in relation to the shoe bottom being operated upon. The tools 168 are also mounted on a common sub frame 156, 158, 160 for pivotal movement about a transverse axis 154 which extends tangential to the shoe bottom engaging portion of the operating surface of the tools, again by computer controlled stepping motor 232 . Grinding stones 630 are provided for grinding the tools 168 , and a further stepping motor 186 operates to move the tools 168 relative to the sub frame 156, 158, 160 to maintain the shoe bottom engaging region of the operating surface of each tool in the datum plane in which said transverse axis 154 lies.
