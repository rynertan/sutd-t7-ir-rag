# Adjustable monolithic ceramic capacitor.

## Abstract
A monolithic ceramic capacitor has at least two main buried electrodes 12, 14 extending to opposite ends of a ceramic body. Two auxiliary electrodes 16, 18 are buried between the two main electrodes and extend to one or both sides of the body. Conductive terminations are applied to the surfaces of the ceramic body so that the capacity measured between the opposite body ends is adjusted by choosing or not choosing to apply termination portions for connecting an auxiliary electrode to a main electrode.
