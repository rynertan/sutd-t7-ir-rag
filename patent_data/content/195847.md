# Remote low battery voltage indicating method and apparatus.

## Abstract
A low battery voltage indicator for use with remote control keyboards which are not linked by a cable to a power supply is described. This invention describes an improved low voltage indicator circuit and a method that utilizes the infra red link and the key encoding circuits of the keyboard to transmit to the base station a key code indicative of the fact that low battery voltage exists. At the base station, the key code is received and is looked up in a table that identi fies the key code as a low battery voltage indication. This causes the base station to flash a low battery voltage warn ing message on the display screen. This replaces a low battery indicator light or buzzer on the remote keyboard unit which normally can use even more power than the infra red transmitter. It also avoids the use of such local devices as buzzers or lights that would only worsen the low battery voltage condition already present.
