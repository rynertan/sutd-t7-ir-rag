# LIGHT TRANSMITTING FILTERS

## Abstract
In a method of making an illuminance correcting light transmitting filter 1 employed in an exposure device for the preparation of the phosphor screen of a colour cathode ray tube, modulated laser light R is irradiated on the surface of a filter base plate 12 on which an opaque thin layer 12A of the recording material has previously been formed. A pattern of through holes of variable size or density is formed as the thin layer 12A is vapourized, so that the light transmitting filter 1 can be prepared with high accuracy in a short time. The filter base plate 12 is mounted on a movable stage 13 , the movement of which in the X and Y directions is controlled by a computer 10 .
