# Method of making a cured foamed aminoformaldehyde product.

## Abstract
A method of making a cured foamed amino formaldehyde product utilises an amino formaldehyde precondensate of water content below 20 by weight in order to obtain a less brittle product. A liquid foamable composition is made by dispersing a curing catalyst and a blowing agent in the precondensate and the composition is heated to cause the blowing agent to form a foam and the precondensate to cure.
