# A counter system.

## Abstract
A counter system comprises at least one counter 1 as well as a plurality of shopping carts 2 . The counter includes a cashier s section 3 as well as a conveyor band 5 advancing articles 15 to said cashier s section. The counter 1 helps in defining a passage 9 , through which the carts 2 pass the cashier s section 3 . The counter 1 includes a bracket shaped receiving section 10 , the distance a of which from the floor on which the system is positioned is only a few millimetres greater than the distance b from the surface 12a of the freely accessible loading surface 12 of the cart to the floor. The passage 9 is of a width c smaller than the width d of the shopping cart 2 so that the shopping carts 2 can only be pushed forward manually in the passage 9 when they are positioned perpendicular to the receiving section 10 and their loading surface 10 simultaneously extends therebelow. In this manner the receiving section 10 brushes off the articles 15 , if any, present on the loading surface 12 of the cart when said cart is to pass the system. In this manner a system is obtained which in a very reliable manner prevents the customer from passing through the system with his articles without having paid for all said articles at ine cashier s section.
