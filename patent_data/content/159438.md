# Multi layered thin film heat transfer gauge.

## Abstract
A pair of metallic thin films are attached to opposite surfaces of a heat resistive thin film, and the heat flux through the heat resistive thin film is determined by mea suring the temperature gradient therein while using the metallic thin films as resistance thermometer elements.
