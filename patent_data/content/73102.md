Such an arrangement may advantageously be modified in that the planet carrier of the first higher ratio gear train is connected to the carrier of the first gear train of the lower ratio gearing and not to its annulus. According to another aspect of the invention there is provided epicyclic change speed gearing comprising a three higher speed ratio epicyclic gear set comprising three epicylic gear trains and a lower ratio gear train, each gear train comprising a sun wheel, an internally toothed annulus and planet pinions meshing with both the sun wheel and the annulus and mounted in a planet carrier, wherein the planet carrier of the low train, the planet carrier of the first train and the annulus of the second train are all connected to the output member, the sun wheels of the first train and the low train are connected to each other and through a first clutch to an input member, the sun wheel of the second train is connected to the carrier of the third gear train and to releasable holding means and further through a second clutch to the input member, the annuli of the first and third gear trains are connected to the planet carrier of the second gear train and to releasable holding means, and further separate releasable holding means are provided for selectively holding the annul us of the low gear train and the sun wheel of the third gear train. Embodiments of the invention will now be described by way ofExample with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figs. 1, 2 and 3 each show diagrammatically the lay out of change speed gearing for three embodiments of the various aspects of the invention and Figures 4a and 4b together show an embodiment of the invention of the kind indicated in Figure 2. In the transmission shown in Figure 1, an input shaft 10 is secured to the input of a clutch Cl, the output of which clutch is secured to a shaft 11. The transmission has five epicyclic gear trains of which the first three provide higher gear ratios while the other trains 4 and 5, provide lower gear ratios. Each of the gear trains comprises a sun gear S, an internally toothed ring gear R, a set of planet pinions P which mesh with both the sun gear and the ring gear and are mounted for rotation about their axes in a planet carrier L, which is itself mounted about the common axes of the transmission. The shaft 11 carries the sun gears Sl and 54. The planet carriers Ll and L4 are connected to the output member 20 of the transmission as is the ring gear R2 of the second gear train. The planet carrier L2 of the second gear train is connected to the ring gears Rl and R3 of the first and third gear trains. A hollow sleeve 13 connects the sun gear S2 of the second gear train and the planet carrier L3 oi the third gear train Lo the output member of a second clutch C2, the input member is which is connected by a cylindrical wall 14 to the input member 10. Selectively operable braking means or clutches Bl, B2, B3, B4 and BS are independently energisable to hold respectively the ring gear Rl, the sun gear S2, the Swl gear S3, the annulus or ring gear R4 and the planet carrier LS stationary. The ring gears R4 and R5 are collected together and the sun gear S5 is connected to the output shaft 20.

With this arrangement, the same ratios are available as in the case ofFigure 1 with the exception that the lowest forward and reverse ratios are not available. It will be noted that in each of the embodiments described above, changing from one ratio to an adjacent ratio merely involves releasing one clutch or brake and engaging one other clutch or brake, thereby facilitating smooth changes between adjacent ratios. Figures 4a and 4b together show a practical embodiment of a transmission of the kind shown in Figure 2. It will be noted that each of the clutches Cl and C2 and brakes Bl, B2, B3, B4 and B5 is of the multiplate disc type and is engaged by means of hydraulic pressure applied to the back of an annular piston Q. A hydro dynamic retarder 41 surrounds the first clutch Cl and its rotary member 42 is secured to the input element 43 of the clutch Cl and thus to the input shaft 10. The stationary portion 44 of the retarder 41 is secured to the casing 45 of the transmission.
