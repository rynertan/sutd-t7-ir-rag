## Description
SINGLE PARTICLE MULTI METALLIC REFORMING CATALYST AND PROCESS OF USING SAME This invention relates to a catalyst composition containing platinum, rhenium and iridium where all three metals are contained on a single refractory support, a method for preparing such a catalyst and a reforming process using this catalyst. The present invention provides a single particle multimetallic reforming catalyst comprising a porous refractory oxide support having uniformly distributed throughout from 0.05 to 5 weight percent each of platinum, iridium and rhenium. The present invention further provides a method for preparing a single particle multi metallic catalyst composite which comprises the steps cif 1 contacting a porous refractory oxide support with gaseous carbon aioxide in an amount and for a pressure and time sufficient to substantially saturate the pores of the support with carbon dioxide and thereafter effecting impregnation of the carbon dioxide contacted support with a platinum, rhenium and iridium such that the metals are substantially uniformly distributed throughout the support. The present invention also provides a reforming process which comprises contacting a reforming charge stock under reforming conditions with the catalyst composition described above. Catalysts intended for use in reforming operations wherein hydrocarbon fractions such as naphthas or gasolines or mixtures thereof are treated to improve the anti knock characteristics thereof are well known in the petroleum industry and have been the subject of intensive investigation in both the patent and technical literature. It has heretofore been proposed to employ platinum metalcontaining catalysts for promoting reforming. Such catalysts are necessarily characterized by a certain amount of acidity. One type of reforming catalyst which has been used commercially consists of alumina base material having platinum metal impregnated thereon, with the acidity characteristics being contributed by a small amount of halogen incorporated in the catalyst. In more recent years, multi metallic reforming catalysts have been the subject of patent and technical literature. These catalysts contain platinum together with one or more additional metals, such as ruthenium, germanium iridium, palladium, rhenium, osmium, rhodium, copper, silver, tin or gold deposited on a refractory support which also contains a specified amount of halogen. Representative of these multi metallic reforming catalysts are those containing platinum and rhenium or platinum and iridium such as described in U.S. Patent Nos.2,848,377, 3,415,737 and 3,953,368. The latter patent reports certain advantages when platinum and iridium are present on a refractory support as highly dispersed polymetallic clusters in which the metallic atoms are separated by a distance of about 2.5 to 4.0 Angstroms. It has also heretofore been known to conduct catalytic reforming utilizing a catalyst consisting essentially of a particularly defined mixture of particles of a porous carrier impregnated with a small amount of platinum and particles of an acidic cracking component. Representative disclosures of such prior art are found inU.S. Patent Nos. 2,854,400, 2,854,403, and 2,854,404. Also, it has been suggested, for example, in German OS 26 27 822 to conduct reforming in the presence of a catalyst constituting a mixture of platinum on one solid catalyst and rhenium on a second solid carrier. The use of trimetallic catalysts is also known in the reforming art and, in fact, single particle platinum, rhenium, and iridium catalysts on an alumina support are specifically taught in U.S.Patent Nos. 3,578,583, 3,617,520, and 3,487,009. Recently, there have been advances made in the art of using separate particles containing platinum and rhenium on one support and iridium on another support. Patents of this general type are U.S.Patent No. 4,288,348 as well as U.S. Patent No. 4,264,475. All of the above catalysts, while possessing certain advantages, are nevertheless subject to improvement with regard to the provision of a reforming catalyst which provides a high yield of gasoline of high octane number over an extended period of time. In accordance with the present invention, reforming of a hydrocarbon charge such as naphtha can be effectively carried out over an extended period of time under conditions of high severity to produce a high yield of gasoline of high octane number when the reforming is conducted in the presence of a single particle, multi metallic reforming catalyst prepared such that the metals are uniformly distributed throughout the support. It is to be immediately recognized that reforming is a very complex chemical reaction and there have been many proposals advanced in the art in order to enhance the catalytic properties of the particular agent which is used. Thus, there have been proposals advanced in the art to obtain a uniform distribution of platinum within the pores of a solid support, such as alumina and, in this connection,U.S. Patent Nos. 2,884,382 and 3,818,207 are concerned with various techniques utilizing carbon dioxide for the preparation of reforming catalysts which have a uniform distribution of platinum.Although the advantages of utilizing a uniform distribution of platinum are well known in the art, nevertheless, when dealing with multi metallic components, there simply is no valid basis for predicting whether uniform distribution would be advantageous in an overall reforming operation, much less whether or not all metals could be uniformly distributed by a particular technique or techniques. Thus, for example, previously referred to U.S. Patent No.3,953,368 points out certain advantages with regard to having polymetallic clusters. In the examples which follow, it will also be shown that techniques which are applicable to some multi metallic components, i.e. tri metallic components, are not applicable to bimetallic components with regard to specific reactions desired to be catalyzed, particularly the dehydrocyclization of normal paraffins to aromatics. It has now been discovered that a single particle supported tri metallic platinum, iridium, and rhenium metal containing catalyst exhibiting improved activity and uniform metal distribution throughout the refractory support can be obtained by pretreating the support with gaseous carbon dioxide before impregnation of the support with the desired metals. Figures 1 to 4 are plots of L alpha intensity of platinum, rhenium, and iridium and platinum and rhenium catalysts as a function of the distance across the respective catalyst particles. One catalyst contains 0.3 weight percent platinum and 0.3 weight percent rhenium and the other catalyst contained 0.3 weight percent each of platinum, rhenium and iridium. Such alpha intensity is derived by focusing an electron beam on the catalyst samples. Figure 1 is directed to a plot for a platinum, rhenium, iridium alumina catalyst subjected to C02 saturation and Figure 2 is a plot of such catalyst prepared without C02 saturation. Figure 3 is specifically directed to such plots for a platinum rhenium alumina catalyst subjected to C02 to saturation. Figure 4 is specifically directed towards such a catalyst which has not been subject to C02 saturation. The multi metallic single particle catalysts of this invention comprise platinum, rhenium and iridium on an appropriate support. Each of the metals individually can range from 0.05 to 5 percent by weight based on the total composition. The particularly preferred catalyst contains 0.3 percent by weight of each of platinum, rhenium and iridium. The refractory support for utilization in the present invention is a porous adsorptive material having a surface area exceeding 20 square meters per gram and preferably greater than about 100 square meters per gram. Refractory inorganic oxides are preferred supports, particularly alumina or mixtures thereof with silica.Alumina is particularly preferred and may be used in a large variety of forms including alumina precipitate or gel, alumina monohydrate and sintered alumina. Various forms of alumina either singly or in combination, such as eta, chi, gamma, theta, delta or alpha alumina may be suitably employed as the alumina support. Preferably, the alumina is gamma alumina and or eta alumina. The above nomenclature used in the present specification and claims with reference to alumina phase designation is that generally employed in the United States and described in The Aluminum Industry Aluminum and Its Production byEdwards, Frary and Jeffries, published by McGraw Hill 1930 . The refractory support, desirably alumina has a preferred particle size of at least 0.01 microns and generally not exceeding about 3000 microns.The alumina may be employed in massive form but generally will be in the form of a powder or in particle form, either irregularly shaped or uniformly shaped as beads, cubes, tablets and extruded pellets. In the preparation of spheroidal alumina gel particles, an alumina hydrosol is prepared by intimate admixture of suitable reactants and the hydrosol is introduced in the form of globules to a water immiscible medium, the depth and temperature of which is controlled so that the hydrosol globules set for spheroidal particles of hydrogel during passage through the medium. The resulting hydrogel particles are thereafter withdrawn from the forming zone and conducted to suitable washing, drying and or calcining equipment as described.Alumina, in the form of a precipitate, may be prepared by adding a suitable reagent such as ammonium hydroxide or ammonium carbonate to an aluminum salt such as aluminum chloride, aluminum nitrate and aluminum acetate in an amount to form aluminum hydroxide which, upon drying, is converted to alumina. After the alumina has been formed, it is generally washed to remove soluble impurities. Washing procedures ordinarily involve washing with water, either in combination with filtration or as separate operations. It has been found that filtration of the alumina is improved when the wash water contains a small amount of ammonium hydroxide. The extent of washing will depend to some extent on the nature of the reactants initially employed in preparation of the alumina precipitate. Halogen may be added to the support, preferably alumina, in a form which will readily react therewith in order to obtain the desired results. One feasible method of adding the halogen is in the form of an acid such as hydrogen fluoride, hydrogen bromide, hydrogen chloride and or hydrogen iodide. Other suitable sources of halogen include volatile salts such as ammonium fluoride and ammonium chloride. When such salts are used, the ammonium ions will be removed during subsequent heating of the catalyst. Halogen may also be added as fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine or by treatment in gaseous hydrogen halide. The halogen, preferably a chlorine or fluorine moiety, may be incorporated into the catalyst at any suitable stage in the catalyst manufacture. Thus, halogen may be added before, after or during incorporation of the metal or metals.It is preferred to introduce halogen during impregnation with the metal or metals after the alumina has undergone carbon dioxide treatment. One method to accomplish this is to use halogen containing metal compounds such as chloroplatinic acid or chloroiridic acid. Additional amounts of halogen may be incorporated in the catalyst by contacting it with materials such as hydrogen fluoride and hydrogen chloride, either prior to or subsequent to the metal impregnation step. Halogen may also be incorporated by contacting the catalyst with a gaseous stream containing the halogen such as chlorine or hydrogen chloride. One feasible way to halogenate the alumina is by the addition of an alkyl halide such as tertiary butyl chloride during the reforming operation.The amount of halogen introduced into the support is such that the halogen content of the overall catalyst is between 0.1 and 5 weight percent. It is an essential feature of the present invention that the alumina base be pretreated with gaseous carbon dioxide prior to impregnation with a solution containing the desired metal or metals.The alumina base either with or without halogen is dried to a water content preferably of less than 30 percent by weight. It is particularly preferred that the alumina base, after drying, be calcined before contact thereof with gaseous carbon dioxide. The dried and or calcined alumina is thereafter, in accordance with the process of this invention, treated with gaseous carbon dioxide. Such treatment is generally effected under room temperature conditions utilizing a carbon dioxide pressure in the range of between about 100 kPa 0 psig and 450 kPa 50 psig . The alumina is generally treated with carbon dioxide for a period between one minute and 48 hours and more usually between one minute and 3 hours.It is to be noted that the time of gas treatment and the gauge pressures set forth above are not considered critical, it being only necessary that the alumina base be exposed to a gaseous carbon dioxide atmosphere for a sufficient period of time and under sufficient pressure to become substantially saturated. The gas initially contained in the pores of the alumina base, which will ordinarily be air, may be replaced by sweeping the alumina particles with gaseous carbon dioxide for a sufficient period of time to replace substantially all of the air in the pores of the alumina with carbon dioxide. It is generally preferred, however, to subject the porous alumina base to a vacuum, thereby removing the air or other gas contained therein and subsequently to contact the evacuated particles with gaseous carbon dioxide.The alumina, after treatment with carbon dioxide, is thereafter impregnated with a solution of a suitable compound s of the desired metal or metals. In one preferred embodiment of the invention, the alumina, after pretreatment, is maintained in an atmosphere of gaseous carbon dioxide during the subsequent impregnation. Desirably, the alumina which has undergone pretreatment with gaseous carbon dioxide should be brought into contact with the impregnating solution containing compound s of the desired metal or metals immediately after such pretreatment to insure the optimum results of this invention. A particularly effective method of impregnating the carbon dioxide treated alumina support comprises the use of an aqueous solution of metal containing acids such as chloroplatinic acid, bromoplatinic acid, chloroiridic acid and perrhenic acid HReO4 A particularly preferred embodiment of this invention involves the preparation of a tri metallic catalyst comprising platinum, rhenium and iridium on alumina. In the preparation of such a catalyst, an aqueous solution of chloroplatinic acid, chloroiridic acid and perrhenic acid is comingled with the carbon dioxide treated alumina particles and the resulting mixture is permitted to stand, preferably with or after suitable agitation, so that thorough mixing is obtained and even distribution of the platinum, iridium, and rhenium solutions throughout the alumina support is attained. This period of contact will generally be in the approximate range of between 10 minutes and 48 hours, and more generally between 10 minutes and 2 hours. Solutions of other compounds which may also be suitably employed for impregnation include platinum tetrachloride, ammonium platinum chloride, trimethyl benzyl ammonium platinum chloride, tetraamineplatinum II chloride, ammonium platinum nitrate, dinitrodiamineplatinum II , ammonium perrhenate, perrhenic acid HReO4 , ammonium perrhenate NH4ReO4 and iridium compounds such as the ammonium chloride double salt, tribromide, trichloride, tetrachloride or chloroiridic acid. Iridium amine complexes may also be suitably employed. The resulting composite of alumina and the metal s with the combined halogen is dried at a temperature of from 930C 2000F to 2600C 5000F for a period of time of from 0.5 hours to 24 hours or longer and thereafter the composite is calcined in the presence of an oxygen containing gas, e.g. air, at a temperature of from 4300C 8000F to 5400C 10000F for a period of time of from 0.5 hour to 12 hours or more. In some instances, the calcination may occur in nitrogen in lieu of air. In addition to calcination, the composite may be exposed in a hydrogen atomosphere to reduce a substantial portion of the metal components to the elemental state. Such reduction is generally conducted at temperatures not in excess of 5400C tlO00 F . Typically the amount of each individual metal component is from 0.05 to 5.0 percent by weight, the remaining weight of the catalyst being support material with some halogen content. The single particle trimetallic catalysts of this invention result in enhancement in catalytic activity, particularly dehydrocyclization activity for reasons that are not completely understood but are as a result of the uniform metal distribution. In a particular embodiment of the method of this invention, alumina beads are pretreated with gaseous carbon dioxide, then, while the beads are mixed by continuous rotation, the beads are impregnated with an aqueous solution containing a compound or complex or complexes of the three desired metals followed by drying and calcination. Post impregnation carbon dioxide treatment may be utilized as a precaution. The catalyst prepared according to the novel method of the instant invention is particularly useful in the reforming of hydrocarbons. Charge stocks undergoing reforming, using the catalyst described herein, are contemplated as those conventionally employed.These include virgin naphtha, cracked naphtha, gasoline, including FCC gasoline, or mixtures thereof boiling within the approximate range of from 200C 700F to 2600C 5000F and, preferably within the range of from 500C 1200F to 2350C 4500F . The charge stock is contacted in the vapor phase with the catalyst at a liquid hourly space velocity of from 0.1 to 10 and preferably from 0.5 to 4. Reaction temperature is within the approximate range of from 3700C 7000F to 5900C 1100 F and preferably from 4300C 800 F to 5650C lOSOoF . Hydrogen may be added to the reaction zone at a range corresponding to a mole ratio of hydrogen to hydrocarbon charge of from 0.5 to 20 and preferably from 2 to 12.Reaction pressure is maintained between 450 kPa 50 psig and 7000 kPa 1000 psig , preferably between 795 kPa 100 psig and 4935 kPa 700 psig . Since the reforming process produces large quantities of hydrogen, at least a portion thereof may be conveniently employed for the introduction of hydrogen with the feed. It is contemplated that the resultant catalyst of the method of the instant invention may be employed in any of the conventional types of processing equipment. Thus, the catalyst may be used in the form of pills, pellets, extrudates, spheres, granules, broken fragments or various other shapes dispersed as a fixed bed within a reaction zone. The charge stock may be passed through the catalyst bed as a liquid, vapor or mixed phase in either upward or downward flow. The catalyst may also be used in a form suitable for moving beds. In such instance, the charge stock and catalyst are contacted in a reforming zone wherein the charge stock may be passed in concurrent or countercurrent flow to the catalyst. Alternatively, a suspensoid type process may be employed in which the catalyst is slurried in the charge stock and the resulting mixture conveyed to the reaction zone.The reforming process is generally carried out in a series of several reactors.Usually, three to five reactors are used. The catalyst prepared according to the method of the invention may be employed in just one of the reactors, e.g. the first reactor or in several reactors or in all reactors. After reaction, the product from any of the above processes is separated from the catalyst by known techniques and conducted to distillation columns where the various desired components are obtained by fractionation. A particularly preferred embodiment of the process of this invention resides in its use for the reforming of highly paraffinic naphthas with feed sulfur levels up to 15 ppm. For reasons which are not completely understood it has been found that the single particle multi metallic reforming catalyst of this invention having a uniform distribution of the three metals permits the optimization of the C5 yields from processing such highly paraffinic naphthas, even though the naphtha has significantly high sulfur levels. Thus deliberate addition of sulfur is advantageous. This is in contrast to existing commercial catalysts which lose their activity and yield stability rapidly at feed sulfur levels near 1 ppm. The following examples illustrate the present invention. The supports used in the following examples were commercially obtained spheroidal 0.159 cm 1 16 inch gamma alumina beads. Typical analytical properties of these beads is given below in Table 1. In general, the supports were humidified before each preparation by storing over water in a closed vessel for at least four hours. This humidification step can be combined with the carbon dioxide pretreatment step, if so desired. The humidification step is not essential to achieve the beneficial results afforded by the present invention. The use of humidification, however, depends on the state of hydration of the support.

The catalyst composite contains 0.3 weight percent platinum, 0.3 weight percent rhenium, and 0.3 weight percent iridium on alumina with carbon dioxide presaturation of the alumina support. A double cone blender was filled with 150 g of humidified X A1203 beads. The blender was attached to a rotary evaporator and was evacuated and backfilled with 002. The blender was then rotated and, under a partial vacuum, the beads were impregnated with 150 ml of an aqueous solution of H2PtC16, HReO4, and H2IrC16 containing the equivalent of 0.45 9 each of metallic platinum, rhenium and iridium. The impregnated beads were held under a C02 atmosphere for one hour and then dried for 18 hours in a forced air draft oven at 121.10C 25O0F . The platinum rhenium iridium containing beads were then calcined for one hour at 454.40C 8500F in nitrogen. This is identified as Catalyst A. EXAMPLE 2 In this example a composite was prepared containing 0.3 weight percent platinum, 0.3 weight percent rhenium, and 0.3 weight percent iridium on alumina without carbon dioxide pretreatment of the support. A double cone blender was filled with 100 g of humidified A1203 beads. The blender was attached to a rotary evaporator and rotated. The beads were impregnated with 50 ml of an aqueous solution of H2PtC16, HReO4 and H2IrC16 containing the equivalent of 0.3 g each of metallic platinum, rhenium and iridium.The impregnated beads were dried for 18 hours in a forced air oven at 121.10C 2500F and calcined for one hour at 454.40C 85O0F in nitrogen. This is identified as Catalyst B. EXAMPLE 3 In this example a bimetallic composite was prepared containing 0.3 weight percent platinum, and 0.3 weight percent rhenium on alumina with carbon dioxide pretreatment of the support. A flask filled with 15 g of humidified A1203 beads were evacuated and backfilled with 002. The beads were impregnated with 13.5 ml of an aqueous solution of H2PtC16 and HReO4 containing an equivalent of 0.045 g of metallic platinum and 0.045 9 of metallic Re.The impregnation technique was that described in Example 1. The impregnated beads were held under a C02 atmosphere for one hour. The beads were then dried at 121.10C 2500F and calcined for two hours at 482.20C 9000F in air. This is identified as Catalyst C. EXAMPLE 4 In this example a composite was prepared containing 0.3 weight percent platinum and 0.3 weight percent rhenium on alumina without C02 pretreatment of the support. Humidified r Al2o3 beads 15 g were impregnated, dried and calcined identically to that described in Example 3 with the exception that the C02 treatment was omitted. This is identified as Catalyst D. EXAMPLE 5 A commercially prepared platinum rhenium reforming catalyst containing 0.3 weight percent platinum and 0.3 weight percent rhenium on extruded gamma alumina was identified as Catalyst E. EXAMPLE 6 In this example separate particles of platinum and rhenium on alumina and iridium on alumina were physically mixed together. The catalyst contained 0.3 weight percent platinum, 0.3 weight percent rhenium, and 0.3 weight percent iridium prepared with C02 pretreatment of the support. This catalyst was labeled Catalyst F and, as is obvious, is not a single particle catalyst within the scope of this invention. EXAMPLE 7 This example describes the preparation of separate particle platinum rhenium on alumina and iridium on alumina catalysts physically mixed together without C02 pretreatment of the support. The catalyst contains 0.3 weight percent platinum, 0.3 weight percent rhenium, and 0.3 weight percent iridium based on total alumina. This catalyst which is not within the scope of the present invention is identified as Catalyst G. EXAMPLE 8 In this example a commercially prepared platinum iridium reforming catalyst comprising 0.3 weight percent platinum, 0.3 weight percent iridium on extruded gamma alumina was identified as Catalyst H. EXAMPLES 9 to 16 The catalysts prepared according to the general procedures ofExamples 1 to 8 each underwent a catalyst dehydrogenation dehydrocyclization screening test using n hexane and cyclohexane as charge stocks. The conditions for such screening tests were as follows Test conditions 0.5 g catalyst H2 Reducation at 4540C Dehydrogenation Charge Stock Cyclohexane WHSV 3 Hr H2 HC 7 Temp. 3000C Time 10 minutes Dehy drocyclization Charge Stock n hexane WHSV 3 Hr H2 HC 7 Temp. 4700C Time 60 minutes The screening test was conducted by first reducing the catalyst sample with hydrogen at 4540C. After such reduction, cyclohexane was passed over the catalyst sample at the above stated conditions for 10 minutes.After this 10 minutes contact, the sample was flushed with hydrogen and the temperature was raised from 3000C to 4700C and then n hexane was passed over the catalyst sample at the above stated conditions for 60 minutes. During the period at which the catalyst was contacted with normal hexane, the methane make and the benzene make were determined.The benzene make is a direct measure of the dehydrocyclization activity of the catalyst and, of course, the methane make determines the practical significance of a catalyst in a reforming process since too high a methane make significantly reduces reformate yield and hydrogen production and can accelerate catalyst aging. The results obtained are shown in Table 2. TABLE 2 Catalyst Screening Test ResultsExample 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16Catalyst A B C D E F G HWt. Pt 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3Wt.

Comparing the results of Examples 11 and 12, i.e. Catalysts C and D, it can be seen that Catalyst D which was prepared without C02 pretreatment produced more benzene than the catalyst prepared with C 2 pretreatment. Thus, the action of a bimetallic catalyst and a trimetallic catalyst is not predictable with regard to whether or not enhanced dehydrocyclization activity is obtained by having uniform distribution. Comparing the results of Example 9 with Example 14, it can be seen that a single particle catalyst produced higher yields of benzene than a multi particle catalyst even though the metal distribution was the same, i.e. uniform. Note that the methane make on Example 14 was very high. With regard to multi particle catalysts, i.e. Examples 14 and 15, note that the catalyst of Example 14, i.e. uniform distribution, produced less benzene than the catalyst of Example 15 having a shell distribution. Thus, no analogy can be made with regard to desirability of having uniform metal distribution as between single particle and multi particle catalysts with regard to benzene make.

EXAMPLES 22 to 26 The following examples will illustrate a particularly preferred embodiment of this invention residing in the reforming of a highly paraffinic naphtha charge stock at various sulfur levels. In this example, the feed employed was a full range naphtha as employed in Examples 17 to 21. The experiment was conducted in a manner similar to that of Examples 17 to 21 in that it was carried out in an adiabatic three reactor system with recycle, alcohol, organic chloride, and sulfur was added to the naphtha as indicated below to simulate exact commercial operations and conditions. The other operating parameters will be set forth in the Table which follows.Sulfur was added in the form of untreated naphtha at 2, 5, 10 and 15 ppm level. The operating conditions and yields are shown in the following Table. In all cases the catalyst employed was catalyst A from Example 1.

This is truly an outstanding result with regard to a reforming catalyst at these significantly high sulfur levels. EXAMPLES 27 and 28 These examples serve as comparative examples in that a commercially prepared catalyst comprising 0.3 weight percent platinum and 0.3 weight percent rhenium on alumina was tested for reforming using a full range naphtha whose properties were given in Examples 22 to 26. Reforming was carried out under the conditions of the previousExamples 22 to 26, except that sulfur was added in the form of unpretreated naphtha at 2 ppm level.The operating conditions and the yields are shown in the following table TABLE Comparison of Yields at Different Sulfur LevelsEMI21.1 tb Example SEP 27 SEP 28 tb Pressure, SEP kPa SEP psig SEP 1723.7 250 tb Total SEP Recycle SEP Ratio SEP 10.45 SEP SEP F SEP tb WHSV SEP 1.14 SEP SEP SEP tb LHSV SEP 1.00 SEP SEP SEP tb R O SEP 98 SEP SEP SEP tb Sulfur, SEP ppm SEP 0.0 SEP 2.0 tb C5 yield, vol. 71.4 69.7H2 purity, mol 69.5 67.2H2 prod., SCF BBL 713 648C1, wt. 2.1 1.9C2, wt. 4.8 5.4C3, wt. 7.1 7.8C4, wt. 8.3 9.1 From the above Table, it can be seen that the addition of 2 ppm of sulfur to the catalyst experienced a loss of 1.7 volume percent in C5 yield with an attendant loss of hydrogen purity due to increased production of C2 C4 gases. Thus, an important embodiment of this invention involves the deliberate addition of sulfur to a feed in order to enhance the yield advantage when using the novel catalysts of this invention. As has been demonstrated in Examples 22 to 26, there is a yield advantage in going from 0 ppm sulfur to 5 ppm sulfur. At 10 ppm sulfur, the yield is equal to 0 ppm sulfur, i.e. there is no longer a yield advantage. Thus, additions of sulfur up to less than 10 ppm improve the yield. This is not true with commercially available trimetallic catalysts non uniform distribution of metals as is shown in Examples 27 and 28. The sulfur can be added to the feed in any convenient manner such as by the separate addition of sulfur compounds or unpretreated naphtha or the severity of the hydrotreating step which precedes reforming can be reduced to provide the desirable levels of sulfur, i.e. 4 10 ppm.
