# Liquid crystal displays.

## Abstract
An active matrix addressed liquid crystal display is described, each liquid crystal cell 21 within the display having two electrodes 23, 25 each carried on a surface of a different one of two insulating plates. Each cell 21 is connected via a respective transistor 27 to a pair of address lines 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39 each address line within a pair being connected to different cells 21 within the array, and each line within a pair being carried on a different plate. Synchronised electrical pulses are applied to the address lines to switch on selected cells 21 within the array, the sense of the pulses on one of the lines being periodically changed.
