# Differential amplifier circuit with rail to rail capability.

## Abstract
A differential amplifier circuit contains a pair of com plementary input portions 3, 5 and 4, 6 . The input portions amplify a common differential input signal to produce corresponding amplified differential signals which are sup plied to a summing section that operates as a modulated current mirror to produce an output signal representative of the input signal. The summing section contains a pair of like polarity first and second amplifiers 13 and 14 and a pair of like polarity third and fourth amplifiers 19 and 20 complementary to the other amplifiers. A pair of impedance elements 11 and 12 are coupled between a first voltage supply ground reference and the third and fourth ampli fiers. A pair of current sources, typically impedance elements 8 and 9 , are coupled between a second voltage supply B and the first and second amplifiers. An important feature of this circuit is that the output signal changes with the differential portion of the input signal as its common mode portion varies over the entire voltage range between the levels of the supplies.
