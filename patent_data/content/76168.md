# Medium characterization system using ultrasonic waves.

## Abstract
A measuring system which characterizes an in homogeneous medium such as living body tissue by trans mitting an ultrasonic wave including a plurality of different frequency components into a measuring medium and analy zing a reflected wave received from the medium. Generally ultrasonic waves of different frequencies have respective different frequency dependent acoustic field profiles. Fre quency characteristics of the measuring system itself are obtained in advance by measuring reflected waves from a reference reflector placed in a reference medium which is homogeneous or weakly inhomogeneous and has an almost or substantially frequency independent attenuation. Com pensation data obtained by such measurement is stored in a memory and when in use for actual measurement of a measuring medium, the data is read out and used to eliminate adverse influences on received waves arising from such differences in acoustic field profiles.
