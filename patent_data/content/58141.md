# Resin impregnated fibre composite materials and a method for their manufacture.

## Abstract
A method for producing resin impregnated fibre compo site material comprising glass and or mineral fibres, ex panded microspheres and a curable resin. A melt of glass or mineral is prepared and the melt is converted to discrete fibres by means of nozzles. A water based solution or dispersion of a thermosetting resin is applied to the fibres, which solution or dispersion contains microspheres. The obtained material, is collected and the microspheres are expanded before or after collecting. In a final treatment the material is pressed or formed, and the resin is fully cured.
