# Method and apparatus for implementing a thermodynamic cycle with intercooling.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for implementing a thermo dynamic cycle with intercooling, includes a condensing subsystem 126 , a boiler 102 , and a turbine 140 . The boiler 102 may include a preheater 104 , an evaporator 106 , and a superheater. After initial expansion in the turbine 134 , the fluid may be diverted to a reheater 122 to increase the temperature available for superheating After return to the turbine 140 and additional expansion, the fluid may be withdrawn from the turbine 140 and cooled in an intercool er 124 . Thereafter the fluid is returned to the turbine 144 for additional expansion. The cooling of the turbine gas may provide additional heat for evaporation. lntercooling may provide compensation for the heat used in reheating and may provide recuperation of available heat which would otherwise remain unused following final turbine expansion.
