## Description
PROCESS FOR PREPARING TERTIARY AMINES WITH A TRIDECATRIENYL CHAIN, AND THE COMPOUNDS OBTAINED This invention relates to compounds of new conception, namely tertiary amines with a tridecatrienyl chain, of formula 2CH CHCH2CRIIIRIVCH2CR CHCH2CH2CH2CR CH2 in which R is hydrogen or an alkyl radical containing up to 5 carbon atoms, R and R are alkyl radicals containing up to 12 carbon atoms, possibly linked together to form a cycle which either contains or does not contain heteroatoms, and RIII and RIV can be COORV, CORV or CN where RV is an alkyl radical containing up to 5 carbon atoms.The said compounds, which are useful as intermediates in organic synthesis or as additives in polymer formulation, are prepared by a process which constitutes a further subject matter of the present invention, and in which a conjugate diene of formula CH2 C R CH CH2 is reacted with amines of formula RIRIINH and vinylcyclopropanes of formulaEMI1.1 the reaction being carried out in the presence of phosphine complexes of transition metals, particularly of palladium complexes of the following formula Pd PR3VI nLm in which n can assume any value between 1 and 4, m can be O or vary up to 3, and n m is 3 or 4, PR3 are trialkyl or triaryl phosphines where is a radical containing up to 13 carbon atoms, and L is an olefin binder containing up to 20 carbon atoms, for example dibenzalacetone or cyclo octadiene. The reaction is carried out at a temperature of between 0 and 100 C in an inert gas atmosphere in the presence of a solvent, generally a nitrile compound or an alcohol, having a boiling point less than 1200C, It is surprising that although the reactants are introduced together, the four molecules become arranged in a precise order, and the amine only partly gives the product resulting from attachment to the diene without reacting with the vinylcyclopropane.To prevent this secondary reaction, it is in any case sufficient to add the diene later, after the amine and vinylcyclopropane in the ratio of 1 1 have reacted, and without treating the reaction mixture in any way.The reaction is carried out by simply bringing the reactants and catalyst into contact under nitrogen. The separation is carried out by conventional methods separation by high vacuum distillation, gas chromatography, liquid chromatography or column chromatography .The starting substances are prepared simply from dichloro or dibromo butene and CH2RIIIRIV compounds. 2 The reactants are used either in stoichiometric ratios or in excess 1 3 moles of amine per mole of vinylcyclopropane, 2 10 moles of butadiene per mole of vinylcyclopropane according to the particular conditions used in relation to the reacted substrates.The number of moles of reactants which can be made to react per mole of complex can reach high values, for example by increasing the reaction time.The aforesaid operating methods will be apparent from the following non limiting examples of the invention. EXAMPLE 1 0.022 g 0.019 mM of Pd PPh3 4 are fed into a 25 ml flask under a nitrogen atmosphere. 0.4 g 1.9 it of l,l dicarbethoxy 2 vinylcyclopropane in 3 ml of acetonitrile are then added, followed by 0.5 ml 5.7 niM of morpholine and, on cooling with an ice and salt bath, 1.7 ml 19.5 mM of 1,3 butadiene. The reaction mixture is then heated by an oil bath to 70 C for 40 hours. It is allowed to cool, and the unreacted butadiene, the solvent and the lighter products deriving from the attachment of the morpholine to two molecules of butadiene are removed under vacuum.On distilling with a bulb furnace and purifying the obtained residue by column chromatography, 0.61 g of product are obtained consisting mainly ofEMI3.1 corresponding to a yield of 7o with respect to the fed vinylcyclopropane, and a catalytic effectiveness of 79 moles of product per mole of palladium complex.Analogous results are obtained after some days at ambient temperature, or by carrying out the reaction in stages, and in particular by reacting 1,1 dicarbethoxy 2 vinylcyclopropane with morpholine in the presence of Pd PPh3 4, which after 24 hours at ambient temperature gives the correspondingN 5,5 dicarbethoxy 2 pentyl morpholine, to which 1,3butadiene is then added.EXAMPLE 2Under the same conditions as example 1, 0.418 g of 1,1 dicarbomethoxy 2 vinylcyclopropane 2.27 mM , o..6 ml of morpholine 6,9 mM , and2 ml of 1,3 butadiene 23 mM in 3.5 ml of acetonitrile are reacted in the presence of 0.026 g of Pd PPh3. 4 0.0225 mM . On proceeding as in example 1, after 20 hours at 70 C, o.645 g of a product are obtained which consists mainly of EMI4.1 corresponding to a yield of 75, with respect to the fed vinylcyclopropane, and a catalytic effectiveness of 75 moles of product per mole of palladium complex.EXAMPLE 3 0.024 g of Pd PPh3 4 0.0208 mM are fed into a 25 ml flask under a nitrogen atmosphere. 0.350 g of l cyano l ctarbethoxy 2 vinylcyclopropane 2.1 nM and 0.66 ml of diethylamine 6.4 mM in 5 ml of acetonitrile are then added. 2 ml of 1,3butadiene 23 fizz are added after 20 hours at ambient temperature. After 24 hours, the unreacted butadiene is removed, and the solvent and lighter products deriving from the attachment of the diethylamine to two molecules of butadiene are distilled off, to give a residue which after column chromatography purification gives 0.67 g of a product consisting mainly of EMI5.1 corresponding to a yield of 91 with respect to the fed vinylcyclopropane, and a catalytic effectiveness of 91 moles of product per mole of palladium complex. Analogous results are obtained after a week at ambient temperature by carrying out the reaction in a single stage.The reaction was also carried out using 5 ml of ethyl alcohol as solvent, employing the same procedure as indicated in this example.0.68 g of the initially obtained tertiary amine were obtained. EX2diPLE 4 0.03l g of Pd PPh3 4 0.0269 mM , 0.506 g of 1 acetyl 1 carb ethoxy 2 vinylcyclopropane 2.8 mM , 0.83 ml of diethylamine 8.0 il in 6 ml of acetonitrile and 2 ml of 1,3 butadiene 23 mM are reacted under the same conditions as example 3.On operating as in example 3, 0.94 g of a product are obtained consisting mainly of EMI6.1 corresponding to a yield of 93 with respect to the fed vinylcyclopropane, and a catalytic effectiveness of 93 moles of product per mole of palladium complex. ExAtLE 5 0.12 g if Pd PPh 4 0.104 mM , 1.9 g of l,l dicarbomethoxy2 vinylcyclopropane 10.3 mM , 1.8 ml of morpholine 20.6 mM , 5 ml of isoprene 50 into in 15 ml of acetonitrile are reacted in a 50 ml flask under a nitrogen atmosphere for four days at 20 C.After separating the palladium by reduction with CO, the lighter products products resulting from the attachment of the amine to the isoprene dimers and the attachment of the amine to the vinylcyclopropane are removed by distillation under vacuum, to give a residue of 2.32 g consisting mainly of EMI6.2 The quantity of product obtained corresponds to a yield of 55 with respect to the fed vinylcyclopropane, and to a catalytic effectiveness of 55 moles of product per mole of palladium complex. Analogous results are obtained by using diethylamine instead of morpholine, and 1,1 dicarbethoxy 2 vinylcyclopropane instead of l,l dicarbomcthoxy 2 vinylcyclopropane. EXAMPLE 6By reacting Pd PPh 4 with 1 cyano 1 carbethoxy 2 vinyl cyclopropane and diethylamine in acetonitrile in a nitrogen atmosphere for 24 hours at ambient temperature and then heating to 800C for a further 24 hours after adding isoprene, the following compound is obtained as the main product of the successive attachment of the amine to the vinylcyclopropane and to the isoprene EMI7.1
