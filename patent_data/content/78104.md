# Filament yarn.

## Abstract
A yarn of a synthetic, fibre forming, polymeric material comprising a plurality of filaments having a substantially rectangular cross section and having a birefringence assymetry across the width of the filaments, each of the filaments being twisted about the longitudinal axis of the filament in such a manner that the overall lateral dimension of the twisted filament corresponds substantially with the length of the rectangular cross section of the filament.
