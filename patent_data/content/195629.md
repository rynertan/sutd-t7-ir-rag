# HOLLOW WAVEGUIDE

## Abstract
A flexible hollow waveguide has an optically smooth, rectangular cross section internal channel, in which reflect ing metal is overcoated with a ThF₄ or ZnSe dielectric approximately one half of the quarter wave thickness. CO₂ laser propagation is promoted for guide curvatures down to about 5 cm radius of curvature.
