# A method and a device for the anaerobic fermentation of organic waste material such as liquid manure.

## Abstract
A method and a device for the anaerobic digestion of organic waste material such as manure in liquid condition include bringing the waste material in an acidification space 17 with a roof 5 collecting gas generated thereby and one or more openings 6, 36 below said roof giving access from said space to a methane fermentation space 18 so that the gas below the roof 5 pushes the liquid to said latter space. A discharge of gas 8, 40 from below said roof 5 to the outside allows liquid to flow back through said openings 6, 36 into the acidification space 17 . Below said roof 5 there may be a separate wall 3, 37 defining a hydrolysis space 16 , into which the waste material is fed at 2, 39 before flowing to the acidification space 17 . The whole of the device or considerable parts of the walls and ducts thereof may be made of flexible gastight material so as to be easily folded or wound up for transport to the site of use as to be inflatable to sustain its operating shape by a higher than atmospheric pressure of the gas therein. The method and the device allow good digestion in a small and simple device of high capacity and low energy demand.
