# A WEFT RESERVOIR FOR FLUID JET LOOMS

## Abstract
In construction of a pin control type weft reservoir particularly suited for alternate weaving by two sorts of wefts on fluid jet looms, coils of weft for two successive weft insertions are fairly separately reserved and independently delivered on a reservoir drum concurrently and compatiblly with continuous supply of weft by a yarn guide through cooperation of three control pins arranged one another in the axial direction of the reservoir drum which enable two separate inter pin weft assignment to a common control pin by their phased movement in the radial direction of the reservoir drum.
