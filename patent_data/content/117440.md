## Description
In the determination of the presence or the identity of genetic material, such as DNA genetic material, it has been proposed to denature the genetic material to form single stranded DNA or single stranded genetic material. The single stranded genetic material is then fixed to a solid support and contacted with a probe, such as a DNA probe, having in its make up bases complementary to the make up of the fixed genetic material to be identified and or determined. The contacting of the single stranded genetic material along with the single stranded probe is carried out under conditions to effect hybridization of the genetic material to be determined or identified and the probe. Radioactively labeled probes, such as radioactively labeled single stranded DNA probes, have been employed. U.S. Patent 4,358,535 discloses a method of identifying a pathogen present in the clinical sample by denaturing the genetic material present in the clinical sample to form single stranded genetic material thereof and to fix the resulting single stranded genetic material characterizing the pathogen to an inert support or surface. The method is especially suitable for screening of bacterial colonies for a specific polynucleotide sequence. The support has to be porous if it is placed on a nutrient medium in order to increase the cell number. The thus fixed single stranded genetic material characterizing or identifying the pathogen is brought into contact with a radioactive single stranded probe under hybridizing conditions to effect duplex form or double strand formation of the genetic material derived from the pathogen and the probe. The presence of the resulting formed duplex between the probe and the pathogen genetic material would then be detected by an insoluble signal and would confirm the presence and or identity of the pathogen. The disadvantages of employing a radioactively labeled probe, such as a radioactively labeled DNA probe, for the identification of genetic material are well known to those skilled in the art. Such disadvantages include not only the precautions and hazards involved in handling the radioactive material but also the short life of such radioactive material and expense in connection with the handling and use of such radioactively labeled DNA probes. It is known to chemically label nucleotides and polynucleotides to avoid the hazards and or difficulties associated when such compounds are radioactively labeled. For example in the article by P.R. Langer, A.A. Waldrop and D.C. Ward entitled Enzymatic Synthesis of Biotin Labeled Polynucleotides Novel Nucleic Acid Affinity Probes , in Compounds or nucleotides have also been prepared which can be incorporated into DNA, such as double stranded DNA, and which are useful for the preparation of non radioactive chemically labeled DNA probes. In EP A 0 063 879 the subject matter of the above identified article is disclosed, and additionally there are disclosed compounds having the structure wherein B represents a purine, deazapurine, or pyrimidine moiety covalently bonded to the C These compounds are widely useful as probes in biomedical research and recombinant DNA technology. Particularly useful are compounds encompassed within this structure which additionally have one or more of the following characteristics A is non aromatic A is at least C₅ the chemical linkage joining B and A includes an α olefinic bond A is biotin or iminobiotin and B is a pyrimidine or 7 deazapurine. EP A 0 063 879 also discloses compounds having the structure wherein each of B, B , and B represents a purine, 7 deazapurine, or pyrimidine moiety covalently bonded to the C These compounds can be prepared by enzymatic polymerization of a mixture of nucleotides which include the modified nucleotides of this invention. Alternatively, nucleotides present in oligo or polynucleotides may be modified using chemical methods. The chemically labeled or modified nucleotides described in the above referred wherein B, A the dotted line and x,y and z are as defined above. Although according to EP A 0 063 879 in principal, all compounds encompassed within the above structural formula may be prepared and used, certain of the compounds are more readily prepared or used or both, and therefore are preferred. Thus, although according to EP A 0 063 879 purines, pyrimidines and 7 deazapurines are in principal useful, pyrimidines and 7 deazapurines are preferred since purine substitution at the 8 position tends to render the nucleotides ineffective as polymerase substrates. Thus, although modified purines are useful in certain respects, they are not as generally useful as pyrimidines and 7 deazapurines. Moreover, pyrimidines and 7 deazapurines useful in that invention must not be naturally substituted at the 5 or 7 positions, respectively. As a result, certain bases, such as thymine, 5 methylcytosine, and 5 hydroxymethylcytosine, are not useful. Preferred bases are cytosine, uracil, deazaadenine and deazaguanine. A may be any moiety which has at least three carbon atoms and is capable of forming a detectable complex with a polypeptide when the modified nucleotide is incorporated into a double stranded duplex containing either deoxyribonucleic or ribonucleic acid. A therefore may be any ligand which possesses these properties, including haptens which are only immunogenic when attached to a suitable carrier, but are capable of interacting with appropriate antibodies to produce complexes. Examples of moieties which are useful according to EP A 0 063 879 include Of these, the preferred A moieties are biotin and iminobiotin. Moreover, since aromatic moieties tend to intercalate into a base paired helical structure, it is preferred in EP A 0 063 879 that the moiety A be nonaromatic. Also, because smaller moieties may not permit sufficient molecular interaction with polypeptides, it is preferred that A be at least C₅ in structure so that sufficient interaction can occur to permit formation of stable complexes. Biotin and iminobiotin are said to satisfy both of these criteria. According to EP A 0 063 879 the linkage or group joining moiety A to base B may include any of the well known bonds, including carbon carbon single bonds, carbon carbon double bonds carbon nitrogen single bonds, or carbon oxygen single bonds. However, it is generally preferred that the chemical linkage include an olefinic bond at the α position relative to B. The presence of such an α olefinic bond serves to hold the moiety A away from the base when the base is paired with another in the well known double helix configuration. This permits interaction with polypeptide to occur more readily, thereby facilitating complex formation. Moreover, single bonds with greater rotational freedom may not always hold the moiety sufficiently apart from the helix to permit recognition by and complex formation with polypeptide. According to EP A 0 063 879 it is even more preferred that the chemical linkage group be derived from a primary amine, and have the structure CH₂ NH , since such linkages are easily formed utilizing any of the well known amine modification reactions. Examples of preferred linkages derived from allylamine and allyl 3 amino 2 hydroxy 1 propyl ether groups have the formulae CH CH CH₂ NH and respectively. Although these linkages are preferred, others can be used, including particularly olefin linkage arms with other modifiable functionalities such as thiol, carboxylic acid, and epoxide functionalities. The linkage groups are attached at specific positions, namely, the 5 position of a pyrimidine, the 8 position of a purine, or the 7 position of a deazapurine. Substitution at the 8 position of a purine does not produce a modified nucleotide which is useful in all the methods discussed in EP A 0 063 879. It may be that the 7 position of a purine, which is occupied by a nitrogen atom, could be the point of linkage attachment. However, the chemical substitution methods employed up to that time were not suitable for this purpose. The letters x, y, and z represent groups attached to the 5 , 3 and 2 positions of the sugar moiety. They may be any of Although conceivable, it is unlikely that all of x, y, and z will simultaneously be the same. More likely, at least one of x, y, and z will be a phosphate containing group, either mono , di , or tri phosphate, and at least one will be HO or H . As will be readily appreciated, the most likely identity of z will be HO or H indicating ribonucleotide or deoxyribonucleotide, respectively. Examples of such nucleotides include 5 ribonucleoside monophosphates, 5 ribonucleoside diphosphates, 5 deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates, 5 p ribonucleoside 3 p, and 5 p deoxyribonucleoside 3 p. More specific examples include modified nucleotides of this type in which A is biotin or iminobiotin, the chemical linkage is CH CH CH₂ NH or and B is uracil or cytosine. The general synthetic approach adopted for introducing the linker arm and probe moiety onto the base is discussed thereinabove. See especially, J.L. Ruth and D.E. Bergstrom, and M.K. Ogawa, J. Amer. Chem. Soc. Because of ease of preparation, it is preferable according to EP A 0 063 879 to use NHS esters for probe addition. However, olefin linker arms with other modifiable functional groups, such as thiols, carboxylic acids, epoxides, and the like, can also be employed. Furthermore, both linker arm and probe can be added in a single step if deemed desirable. Having the biotin probe directly attached to the nucleotide derivatives that are capable of functioning as enzyme substrates offers considerable versatility, both in the experimental protocols that can be performed and in the detection methods microscopic and non microscopic that can be utilized for analysis. For example, biotin nucleotides can be introduced into polynucleotides which are in the process of being synthesized by cells or crude cell extracts, thus making it possible to detect and or isolate nascent growing polynucleotide chains. Such a procedure is impossible to do by any direct chemical modification method. Furthermore, enzymes can be used as reagents for introducing probes such as biotin into highly selective or site specific locations in polynucleotides the chemical synthesis of similar probe modified products would be extremely difficult to achieve at best. Further, there are disclosed in EP A 0 097 373 modified non radioactive chemically labeled nucleotides wherein the nucleotides modified such as at the 5 position of pyrimidine or the 7 position of purine, preparatory for the preparation of nucleotide probes therefrom are suitable for attachment to or incorporation into DNA or other nucleic acid materials. In the preparation of such modified nucleotides, the nucleotides, i.e. nucleic acids, preferably are modified in a non disruptive manner such that the resulting modified nucleotides are capable of incorporation into nucleic acids and once incorporated in nucleic acids, the modified nucleotides do not significantly interfere with the formation or stabilization of the double helix formed of the resulting nucleic acids containing the modified nucleotides. The non disruptive modification of nucleotides and nucleic acids incorporating such modified nucleotides is in contrast with those modifications of nucleotides which are characterized as a disruptive modification in the sense that the resulting disruptively modified nucleotides and nucleic acids containing the same block proper double helix formation. In the practices of EP A 0 097 373, the nucleotides are desirably modified at the 5 position of the pyrimidine or the 7 position of the purine. The nucleotides so modified are non disruptively modified and nucleic acids containing such nucleotides are capable of forming a double helix arrangement. Broadly, in another aspect of the practices of EP A 0 097 373 , various methods are useful for the tagging or labeling of DNA in a non disruptive manner. For example, biotin is added on the end of a DNA or RNA molecule. The addition of biotin is accomplished by addition of a ribonucleotide. The 3 ,4 vicinal hydroxyl groups are oxidized by periodate oxidation and then reduced by a borohydride in the presence of biotin hydrazide. Alternatively, carbodiimide can also be used to couple biotin to the aldehyde group. Another technique for tagging nucleic acid material such as DNA or RNA involves the addition of a large marker to the end of a DNA or RNA molecule. One example of this technique is the addition of a molecule, e.g. lysylglycine, where the amino groups are tagged with biotin. Another example would be to follow the procedure set forth hereinabove but employing carbodiimide as the cross linking agent. Still another example of this technique would be to produce a biotinylated dA dU double helical polymer and to ligate this polymer to the probe prepared in accordance with EP A 0 097 373. Another technique for tagging DNA in a non disruptive manner involves the isolation of dPyrTP having a putricine or spermidine on the 5 position from PS16 or phage infected cells. If desired, dPyrTP is made from phage DNA and phosphorylated to dPyrTP followed by modification of the polyamine side chain by means of standard nucleophilic reagent NHS biotin. Another technique for tagging DNA in a non disruptive manner involves the addition of glucose to 5 hydroxymethylcytosine 5 HMC in DNA using T4 phage glycosylating enzymes followed by screening by means of a lectin based assay. Still another method for tagging DNA in a non disruptive manner involves 5 HMC triphosphate made from the hydrolysis of T4 DNA followed by phosphorylation of the 5HMCMP to 5 MMCTP. 5 HMCTP is then incorporated into DNA using polymerase I. Thus, any DNA can be modified to have non disruptively incorporated therein 5 HMC. A method for tagging DNA in a mildly disruptive manner according to EP A 0 097 373 involves reacting nucleic acids in the double helical form with alkylating reagents as for example benz o pyrene diol epoxide or aflatoxin. Under appropriate conditions of the N² group of guanine, the N⁴ group of adenosine or the N⁴ group of cytosine are alkylated. These modified nucleotides can be used as linking arms for the addition of a reporter molecule such as biotin. These specially modified nucleotides suitable as non radioactive chemical labels for DNA probes or DNA material as described in EP A 0 097 373 can be broadly characterized and described as phosphate P moiety, a sugar or monosaccharide S moiety, a base B moiety, a purine or a pyrimidine and a signalling chemical moiety Sig covalently attached thereto, either to the P, S or B moiety. Of special interest are those nucleotides having a general formula Another special nucleotide in accordance with EP A 0 097 373 is characterized by the general formula Such nucleotides would be characterized as ribonucleotides. The phosphate moiety is attached at the 2 , 3 and or 5 position of the sugar S moiety and the base B being attached from the N1 position or the N9 position to the 1 position of the sugar S moiety when said base is a pyrimidine or a purine, respectively. The Sig chemical moiety is covalently attached to the sugar S moiety is capable of signalling itself or making itself self detecting or its presence known and preferably permits the incorporation of the ribonucleotide into its corresponding double stranded RNA or a DNA RNA hybrid. Such nucleotides desirably have the Sig chemical moiety attached to the C2 position of the S moiety or the C3 position of the S moiety. Still further, nucleotides in accordance with the practices of EP A 0 097 373 include the nucleotides having the formula wherein P is the phosphate moiety, S the sugar moiety and B the base moiety. In these special nucleotides, the P moiety is attached to the 3 and or the 5 position of the S moiety when the nucleotide is deoxyribonucleotide and at the 2 , 3 and or 5 position when the nucleotide is a ribonucleotide. The base B is either a purine or a pyrimidine and the B moiety is attached from the N1 or the N9 position to the 1 position of the sugar moiety when said B moiety is a pyrimidine or a purine, respectively. The Sig chemical moiety is covalently attached to the phosphoric acid P moiety via the chemical linkage said Sig, when attached to said P moiety being capable of signalling itself or making itself self detecting or its presence known and desirably the nucleotide is capable of being incorporated into a double stranded polynucleotide, such as DNA, RNA or DNA RNA hybrid and when so incorporated therein is still self detecting. It is pointed out that the special nucleotides in accordance with the practices of EP A 0 097 373 described or defined hereinabove by the general formula P S B Sig, also include nucleotides wherein the Sig chemical moiety is covalently attached to the B moiety at the N⁶ or 6 amino group position when the B moiety is adenine or the N² or 2 amino group position when the B moiety is guanine or the N⁴ or 4 amino group position when the B moiety is cytosine. The resulting nucleotides containing the Sig moiety attached thereto are capable of signalling themselves or making themselves self detecting or their presence known and being detectable is a double stranded or DNA, RNA or DNA RNA hybrid. By way of summary, as indicated hereinabove with respect to the make up of the various special nucleotides in accordance with EP A 0 097 373, the special nucleotides can be described as comprising a phosphate moiety P, a sugar moiety S and a base moiety B, a purine or pyrimidine, which combination of P S B is well known with respect to and defines nucleotides, both deoxyribonucleotides and ribonucleotides. The nucleotides are then modified by having covalently attached thereto, to the P moiety and or the S moiety and or the B moiety, a chemical moiety Sig. The chemical moiety Sig so attached to the nucleotide P S B is capable of rendering or making the resulting nucleotide, now comprising P S B with the Sig moiety being attached to one or more of the other moieties, self detecting or signalling itself or capable of making its presence known per se, when incorporated into a polynucleotide, especially a double stranded polynucleotide, such as a double stranded DNA, a double stranded RNA or a double stranded DNA RNA hybrid. The Sig moiety desirably should not interfere with the capability of the nucleotide to form a double stranded polynucleotide containing the special Sig containing nucleotide in accordance with this invention and, when so incorporated therein, the Sig containing nucleotide is capable of detection, localization or observation. The Sig moiety employed in the make up of the special nucleotides of EP A 0 097 373 could comprise an enzyme or enzymatic material, such as alkaline phosphatase, glucose oxidase, horseradish peroxidase or ribonuclease. The Sig moiety could also contain a fluorescing component, such as fluorescein or rhodamine or dansyl. If desired, the Sig moiety could include a magnetic component associated or attached thereto, such as a magnetic oxide or magnetic iron oxide, which would make the nucleotide or polynucleotide containing such a magnetic containing Sig moiety detectable by magnetic means. The Sig moiety might also include an electron dense component, such as ferritin, so as to be available by observation. The Sig moiety could also include a radioactive isotope component, such as radioactive cobalt, making the resulting nucleotide observable by radiation detecting means. The Sig moiety could also include a hapten component or per se be capable of complexing with an antibody specific thereto. Most usefully, the Sig moiety is a polysaccharide or oligosaccharide or monosaccharide, which is capable of complexing with or being attached to a sugar or polysaccharide binding protein, such as a lectin, e.g. Concanavilin A. The Sig component or moiety of the special nucleotides could also include a chemiluminescent component. As indicated in accordance with the practices of EP A 0 097 373, the Sig component could comprise any chemical moiety which is attachable either directly or through a chemical linkage or linker arm to the nucleotide, such as to the base B component therein, or the sugar S component therein, or the phosphoric acid P component thereof. The Sig component of the nucleotides in accordance with EP A 0 097 373 and the nucleotides and polynucleotides incorporating the nucleotides containing the Sig component are equivalent to and useful for the same purposes as the nucleotides described in EP A 0 063 879. More specifically, the chemical moiety A described in EP A 0 063 879 is functionally the equivalent of the Sig component or chemical moiety of the special nucleotides of EP A 0 097 373. Accordingly, the Sig component or chemical moiety of nucleotides of EP A 0 097 373 can be directly covalently attached to the P, S or B moieties or attached thereto via a chemical linkage or linkage arm as described in EP A 0 097 373, as indicated by the dotted line connecting B and A of the nucleotides of EP A 0 063 879 . The various linker arms or linkages identified in EP A 0 063 879 applicable to and useful in the preparation of the special nucleotides of EP A 0 097 373. A particularly important and useful aspect of the special nucleotides of EP A 0 097 373 is the use of such nucleotides in the preparation of DNA or RNA probes. Such probes would contain a nucleotide sequence substantially matching the DNA or RNA sequence of genetic material to be located and or identified. The probe would contain one or more of the special nucleotides of this invention. A probe having a desired nucleotide sequence, such as a single stranded polynucleotide, either DNA or RNA probe, would then be brought into contact with DNA or RNA genetic material to be identified. Upon the localization of the probe and the formation of a double stranded polynucleotide containing the probe and the matching DNA or RNA material to be identified, the resulting formed double stranded DNA or RNA containing material would then be observable and identified. A probe in accordance with EP A 0 097 373 may contain substantially any number of nucleotide units, from about 5 nucleotides up to about 500 or more, as may be required. It would appear that 12 matching, preferably consecutive, nucleotide units would be sufficient to effect an identification of most of the DNA or RNA material to be investigated or identified, if the 12 nucleotide sequence of the probe matches a corresponding cooperative sequence in the DNA or RNA material being investigated or to be identified. As indicated, such probes may contain one or more of the special Sig containing nucleotides preferably at least about one special nucleotide per 5 10 of the nucleotides in the probe. The present invention relates to a method for detecting a polynucleotide sequence which comprises In accordance with the practice of this invention, non radioactive chemically labeled polynucleotides are prepared such as non radioactive chemically labeled single stranded DNA probes. Such probes are then brought into contact with genetic material to be identified or otherwise detected. Before these probes are brought into contact with the genetic material to be identified or investigated, the genetic material is denatured to produce or form single stranded genetic material therefrom, such as single stranded DNA derived from the genetic material, and is fixed to a suitable inert support or surface such as a plastic material, e.g. polystyrene, preferably a transparent or translucent surface such as glass. Thereupon, the special non radioactive chemically labeled probes, such as the special non radioactive chemically labeled single stranded DNA probes of this invention are brought into contact with the thus fixed single stranded genetic material under hybridizing conditions. The probe is selected to provide sufficient number, e.g. at least about 25 bases, in its make up, complementary to the bases making up the genetic material to be detected or identified. The hybridization of the probe to the singlestranded genetic material to be identified with resulting double stranded or duplex formation would be then detected by means of the non radioactive chemical Label attached to the probe portion of the resulting formed double stranded hybrid or duplex hybrid. Various techniques, depending upon the non radioactive chemical label employed in the make up of the probe, may be employed to detect the formation of the double strand or duplex hybrid. It is preferred, however, in the practices of this invention, to employ spectrophotometric techniques and or enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ELISA techniques for the determination of the formed hybrid. Spectrophotometric and ELISA techniques permit not only the detection of the resulting formed double stranded hybrid, but also permit the quantitative determination thereof, such as by the enzymatic generation of a product that can be measured colorimetrically or fluorometrically. In colorimetric determination, an enzyme linked antibody, such as alkaline phosphatase linked antibody, would be attached to the non radioactive chemically labeled probe and employed for the enzymatic generation of the product that can be measured colorimetrically or spectrophotometrically. Another suitable spectrophotometric or colorimetric technique involves immunofluorescence, wherein fluorescein labeled antibody is employed in the make up prior to or is attached to the non radioactive chemical label after hybrid formation and the fluorescein labeled antibody attached or fixed to the probe measured fluorometrically. Spectrophotometric or colorimetric techniques, in addition to providing the above identified quantitative result, also usefully provide a fairly prompt visual manifestation or elicitation of the non radioactive chemical label in the resulting formed double stranded hybrid. Other ELISA like or related techniques are also useful for the detection of the non radioactive chemical label in the formed duplex, such other techniques would also involve the use of enzymes, e.g. immunoperoxidase, or the use of electron dense markers, e.g. immunoferritin, or other chemical and or physical markers, attachable or attached to the probes. Broadly, the practices of this invention provide techniques comparable to enzyme linked immunosorbent assay techniques, not only for the qualitative, but also the quantitative determination of hybrid formation. As indicated, it is preferred to use ELISA techniques to effect or bring about the expression or indication of, qualitatively or quantitatively, of the non radioactive chemically labeled probe in the resulting formed double stranded or hybridized material, such as the duplex or hybrid formed by the non radioactive chemically labeled DNA probe and its substantially complementary genetic DNA material derived from the denatured genetic DNA material to be identified. In the preferred ELISA technique in accordance with this invention, single stranded genetic material, e.g. DNA, after denaturing of the DNA material to be identified to form the single stranded DNA material, is fixed to a substrate. In the practices of this invention, it is preferred that the substrate be a transparent substrate, such as a glass substrate or surface. By employing a transparent substrate, such as a glass substrate, to which the single stranded DNA material is fixed and hybridized, the ELISA technique provides for qualitative and quantitative determination of the DNA material to be identified. By employing a transparent substrate to which the DNA material is fixed, full realization of the benefits and versatility of the ELISA techniques applied to the practices of this invention are obtainable. Further embodiments of the present invention are explained in detail in the following The substrate may be made of glass or other siliceous material. Said chemically labeled nucleotide may be a compound of the formula wherein B represents a purine, 7 deazapurine or pyrimidine moiety covalently bonded to the C or of the formula, wherein each of B, B and B represents a purine, deazapurine, or pyrimidine moiety covalently bonded to the C The chemically labeled nucleotide has the general formula, wherein P is the phosphate moiety, S the sugar moiety and B the base moiety, the phosphate moiety being attached at the 2 , 3 and or 5 position of the sugar moiety, said base B being attached from the N1 position or the N9 position to the 1 position of the sugar moiety when said base is a pyrimidine or a purine, respectively, and wherein said Sig is a chemical moiety covalently attached to the sugar S, said Sig, when attached to said Sugar S, being capable of signalling itself or making itself self detecting or its presence known or the general formula, wherein P is the phosphate moiety, S the sugar moiety and B the base moiety, the phosphate moiety being attached to the 3 and or the 5 position of the sugar moiety when said nucleotide is a deoxyribonucleotide and at the 2 , 3 and or 5 position when said nucleotide is a ribonucleotide, said base B being a purine or pyrimidine, said base B being attached from the N1 position or the N9 position to the 1 position of the sugar moiety when said base B is a pyrimidine or a purine, respectively, and wherein Sig is a chemical moiety covalently attached to the phosphate moiety via the chemical linkage, said Sig, when attached to said phosphate moiety P being capable of signalling itself or making itself self detecting or its presence known, or the general formula, and when Sig is attached to the S moiety, the S moiety is a ribose group, said chemical moiety Sig when attached to said P, S or B being capable of signalling itself or making itself self detecting or its presence known. The method of the present invention may be used for detecting the presence of a pathogen in a clinical sample suspected of containing said pathogen, said method comprising depositing said sample on an inert transparent or translucent support, treating said sample to affix genetic material of any of said pathogens present in said sample to said support in substantially single stranded form, contacting said fixed single stranded genetic material with a non radioactive chemically labeled probe having a nucleotide sequence of at least about 25 bases at least substantially complementary to a nucleotide sequence of a structural gene characteristic of said pathogen, said chemically labeled probe having therein one of the chemically labeled nucleotides as described above, said contacting being under hybridizing conditions at a predetermined stringency and detecting duplex formation on said support by means of said chemically labeled probe.

The double stranded polynucleotide may be a double stranded polyribonucleotide, or a double stranded polydeoxyribonucleotide, or it comprises as one of the strands polydeoxyribonucleotide and the other strand a polyribonucleotide. The substrate may be transparent or translucent and adapted for the transmission of light therethrough for color observation or colorimetric determination of said double stranded polynucleotide on said transparent substrate, whereby said transparent substrate is glass. Said substrate may be a planar substrate provided with a well therein wherein said double stranded polynucleotide is fixed, whereby said substrate carrying said double stranded polynucleotide fixed to a well therein is adapted for the transmission of light therethrough for the photometric or colorimetric determination of the double stranded polynucleotide fixed within said well. Said substrate is a plastic coated substrate, a glass coated substrate, a plastic substrate, a polystyrene substrate, a polyethylene substrate, a polypropylene substrate, a celluose substrate, a nitrocellulose substrate, a dextran substrate, an epoxy or expoxy coated substrate, has amino groups attached or fixed to the surface thereof, or provides a surface capable of fixing or immobilizing negatively charges polyelectrolytes thereon. Said substrate provides a surface capable per se or untreated of fixing or immobilizing single stranded or double stranded polynucleotides thereto or permits the hybridization of a non radioactive chemically labeled polynucleotide to an unlabled single stranded polynucleotide or DNA fixed to said surface. The method of the present invention may be used for determining the presence of a selected genetic material which comprises treating a sample containing said selected genetic material so as to denature the same to provide a single strand thereof derived from said genetic material, fixing the resulting single strand of genetic material to a surface, contacting under hybridizing conditions the thus fixed single strand of genetic material with a non radioactively chemically labeled polynucleotide probe substantially complementary to the nucleotide components characterizing said genetic material to be determined and detecting duplex formation between said single strand of genetic material and said non radioactive chemically labeled polynucleotide probe, wherein said surface is a glass surface and wherein said single stranded genetic material is fixed to a well provided on said surface, said surface being adapted for the transmission of light therethrough for the photometric or colorimetric determination of duplex formation between said single stranded genetic material and said polynucleotide probe, wherein said duplex formation between said single strand of genetic material and said non radioactive, chemically labeled polynucleotide probe is detected or determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ELISA . The detection of duplex formation between said single strand of genetic material and said non radioactive, chemically labeled polynucleotide probe is determined by forming a complex with a chemical label provided on said polynucleotide probe, said complex comprising an enzyme, and eliciting the presence of said enzyme containing complex attached to said chemical label by bringing said enzyme containing complex attached to said polynucleotide probe into contact with a substrate which undergoes a chemical or color change when in contact with said enzyme. The present invention further relates to a method wherein duplex or double strand formation or hybridization between said fixed single strand of material and said non radioactive chemically labeled polynucleotide probe is determined by providing said chemical label attached to said polynucleotiode probe, before or after duplex formation, with a chelating agent and eliciting the presence of said chelating agent by contacting said chelating agent with a substrate which undergoes a chemical reaction or color change when in contact with said chelating agent, whereby eliciting the presence of said chelating agent is carried out by contacting said chelating agent with a substrate which undergoes a chemical reaction or a color change when in contact with said chelating agent, whereby said color change is photometrically or colorimetrically determined and is indicative of the amount of chelating agent fixed to the resulting formed duplex. The support for fixing genetic DNA material thereto may be a glass surface which has been prepared by treating it with aqueous nitric acid solution at a temperature of about the boiling point of the nitric acid solution, washing the resulting nitric acid treated glass surface and, after drying the thus treated glass surface, contacting the thus treated glass surface with gamma aminopropyltriethoxysilane, washing and drying the resulting treated glass surface and fixing DNA material thereto, whereby the transparent glass surface suitable for fixing genetic DNA material thereto may have attached or fixed thereto amino groups. Further methods for treating the surface are the following A method of treating a glass surface for the fixing of genetic DNA material thereto, which comprises contacting said glass surface with an organosilane, said organosilane providing an organic functional group at one end and a silyl alkoxy group at the other end under conditions so as to fix the silyl alkoxy group portion of the organosilane to said glass surface. In the method of the invention there may be used a transparent glass container or cuvette provided with planar walls, the interior surface of the container having fixed thereto double stranded polynucleotide or a planar form transparent glass plate provided with rows of wells or depressions formed on the surface thereof, the surface of said wells or depressions having fixed thereto double stranded polynucleotide, one of the strands of said double stranded nucleotide being a non radioactively chemically labeled polynucleotide or comprises a non radioactively chemically labeled nucleotide as a nucleotide component of said one strand.

If the method of the invention is used for determining the presence of genetic material, the detection of duplex formation by the said single strand of genetic material and said non radioactive, chemically labeled polynucleotide probe is determined by forming a complex with a chemical label providing on said polynucleotide probe, said complex comprising a component capable of signalling or eliciting its presence by spectrophotometric or colorimetric means. If the method of the invention is used for the detection of a pathogen, it may be a streptococcus, a staphylococcus, a pneumococcus, a meningococcus, a salmonella typhimurium, or a clostridium botulinum. A specific embodiment of the claimed method is a method for detecting the presence or identity of genetic DNA material which comprises depositing a sample of genetic material on an inert transparent support surface, treating said sample to affix said genetic DNA material to said support in substantially single stranded form, contacting said fixed single stranded genetic DNA material with a non radioactive chemically labeled probe having a nucleotide sequence of at least about 25 bases, at least substantially complementary to the nucleotide sequence contained in said genetic DNA material, said chemically labeled probe having therein a chemically labled nucleotide as described above, said contacting being under hybridising conditions at a predetermined stringency and detecting duplex formation of said genetic DNA material fixed to said support surface by means of said chemically labeled probe. The invention also relates to a device or system for detecting or measuring a color change or chemical reaction colorimetrically or photometrically which comprises a transparent substrate which has associated with or fixed thereto a single stranded chemically labeled DNA probe hybridized to a complementary single stranded DNA material, said chemical label having an enzyme complex attached thereto, means for adding a chemical substrate to contact said enzyme complex attached to said chemical label of said hybridized single stranded DNA probe associated with or fixed to said transparent substrate so as to generate by reaction between said enzyme complex and said chemical substrate a color change or a photometrically detectable chemical reaction, means for illuminating or passing light onto or through said transparent substrate containing said enzyme complex involved in said color change or chemical reaction comprising means for colorimetrically or photometrically detecting said color change or photometrically detectable chemical reaction brought about by contact between said enzyme complex and said chemical substrate, wherein said means for illuminating or passing light onto or through said transparent substrate containing said enzyme complex involved in said color change or said chemical reaction includes means for quantitatively measuring said color change or said photometrically detectable chemical reaction. The device or system may be packaged in association with instructions for use in accordance with the claimed method. The invention further relates to a kit for detecting a polynucleotide sequence, which comprises the above mentioned device in packaged combination with a container of an oligonucleotide or polynucleotide probe, having covalently attached thereto a chemical label comprising a signalling moiety capable of generating a soluble signal. It is known to fix enzymes and the like to siliceous materials and to detect antibodies and the like involving attachments of such materials as enzymes, antibodies and antigens to various substrates, such as siliceous substrates. See for example U.S. Patent Nos. 3,669,841, 3,715,278, 3,949,064, 4,001,583, 4,059,685, 4,120,945 and 4,280,992. In the practices of this invention, it is highly desirable that the fixing of the denatured single stranded genetic DNA material derived from the DNA material to be identified be rapidly fixed to the substrate, such as a transparent substrate, e.g. a glass surface. Rapid fixing of single stranded DNA material to a transparent glass substrate would permit rapid testing of numerous samples involving ELISA techniques. For example, glass plates provided with an array of depressions or wells therein would have samples of the various denatured genetic materials to be identified deposited therein and the single stranded DNA material therein fixed to the surfaces of the wells. Thereupon, DNA probes provided with a non radioactive chemical label are deposited in each of the wells for hybridization to any complementary single stranded DNA material therein. After washing to remove any non hybridised probe, the presence of any hybrid DNA material containing the single stranded DNA material to be identified and the non radioactive chemically labeled probe is detected, as described herein, involving the addition of an enzyme linked antibody or other suitable entity for attachment to the chemical label of the probe. Subsequently a suitable substrate is added to elicit a color change or chemical reaction which could then be measured colorimetrically or photometrically. To effect rapid fixing of DNA material, such as denatured single stranded DNA, to glass, the glass is prepared or pretreated by heating or boiling the glass, such as a borosilicate glass, for a sufficient period of time, e.g. about 45 minutes, in the presence of dilute, e.g. 5 percent, aqueous nitric acid. This pretreatment with nitric acid serves to leach out boron residues from the glass surface. The treated glass is then washed or rinsed with water, preferably with distilled water, and dried, such as at a temperature of about 115 To illustrate the practices of this invention, various DNA materials were prepared. For example, bacteriophage T₄ DNA was isolated from Other reagents were obtained or prepared, for example, lectins which readily and eagerly form a complex with glucosyl groups. Specifically Concanavalin A ConA was obtained and solubilized in 2.0M NaCl at a concentration of 50 mg ml. Also, fluorescein labeled ConA was prepared by reacting ConA with fluorescein isothiocyanate at a FITC to protein molar ratio of 3 in 0.1M sodium borate solution at a pH of 9.2 and at a temperature of 37 A glass surface treated as described hereinabove was employed in the detection of lectin binding to glucosylated DNA. In this procedure, glucosylated DNA T₄ DNA or non glucosylated DNA calf thymus DNA was delivered in 100 µl portions to treated glass tubes in triplicate set. After 15 30 minutes at room temperature, the solution was removed and the tubes rinsed generously with PBS Mg buffer 100mM Na K Po₄, pH 6.5, 150mM NaCl and 10mM MgCl₂ . One set of tubes was checked for the presence of DNA by staining with ethidium bromide 100 µl of 1 mg ml solution, 30 minutes in the dark, at room temperature . The staining solution was removed and the tubes rinsed and checked under UV light. To another set of tubes there was delivered fluorescent labeled ConA 100 µl of 0.1 mg ml in PBS Mg buffer . After 60 minutes at room temperature, the solution was removed and the tubes were rinsed and checked under UV light. To the third set of tubes was delivered 100 µl of unlabeled ConA in PBS Mg buffer. After 60 minutes at room temperature, the tubes were rinsed free of ConA with 0.2M Imidazole buffer pH 6.5. Acid phosphatase was then added 0.005 units in 100 µl at 0.2 percent phosphatase free BSA and the tubes were incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. After rinsing with 0.15M NaCl to remove any unbound enzyme substrate para nitrophenylphosphate 0.1mM in 0.2M Imidazole pH 6.5 was added and incubation continued for 60 minutes at 37 The resulting observed test results indicated that both glucosylated and non glucosylated DNA bound to the activated glass surface by the observed red fluorescence characteristic of ethidium bromide. Also, ConA bound only to glucosylated DNA as noted by the green fluorescence in tubes containing T₄ DNA, but not in tubes which had calf thymus DNA. Further, acid phosphatase, which is a glycoprotein, gave positive reaction only in tubes containing T₄ DNA and ConA, but was washed off from the tubes which contained only ConA or ConA and calf thymus DNA. Activated glass tubes were also employed in the detection of lectin binding to glucosylated DNA probes hybridized to DNA already immobilized on glass surface. In these test, phage lambda DNA was immobilized on glass surface. After rinsing with buffer, the tubes were coated with 100 µl of coating solution 50 percent formamide, 5X SSC, 100 µg salmon sperm DNA, 0.2 percent polyvinyl pyrrolidone, 0.1 percent Triton X 100, 0.2 percent BSA and 0.05 percent SDS at 42 In these tests, the glucosyl monosaccharide moiety of the glucosylated DNA probe serves the non radioactive chemical label and reacts with or is strongly attracted to the lectin, ConA, making up the combination lectin enzyme acid phosphatase probe detection system. In the above test employing glucosylated DNA as a probe, wherein the glucosyl or monosaccharide moiety of the glucosylated DNA probe serves as the non radioactive chemical label, comparable results are also achievable in the practice of this invention employing a biotin labeled DNA probe. When biotin is employed as the non radioactive chemical label of the DNA probe, and since avidin is strongly reactive with or strongly bonds to biotin, the presence of the biotin labeled DNA probe would be elicited or detected by means of avidin or streptavidin labeled enzyme. For example, a biotin labeled DNA probe would readily be detected by an enzyme complex of the character avidin biotin alkaline phosphatase. More specifically, the presence of the biotin labeled DNA probe would readily be elicited or detected by contacting the hybrid containing the biotin labeled probe with the enzyme complex avidin biotin alkaline phosphatase, followed by bringing the resulting biotin labeled DNA probe having attached thereto the avidin biotin alkaline phosphatase complex into contact with a suitable substrate which by color reaction or precipitate formation brought about by the alkaline phosphatase would be readily noticed or capable of being determined, both qualitatively and quantitatively, by photometric and or colorimetric means in accordance with ELISA techniques. If desired, instead of an avidin biotin enzyme complex, there could be used an antibody to biotin for attachment to the biotin moiety of the biotin labeled DNA probe, followed by a complex comprising anti antibody enzyme in the manner described hereinabove. The advantages of the practices of this invention are also obtainable when the DNA probe is fixed to or hybridized to a plastic surface, such as a polystyrene surface. When a plastic surface is employed, it is sometimes desirable, in order to increase the effectiveness or uniformity of the fixing of DNA applied thereto, including the non radioactive chemically labeled DNA probe, to treat the plastic surface, such as a polystyrene surface, to enhance and otherwise improve the fixing or immobilization of genetic material thereon, such as single stranded denatured DNA or a non radioactive chemically labeled probe or hybrid DNA containing the DNA probe. It has been found, for example, that the adherence or fixing of DNA to a polystyrene surface is improved by treating the surface, as indicated hereinabove, with an amino substituted hydrophobic polymer or material, such as duodecadiamine. Another technique for improving the fixing or uniformity of the plastic surface for fixing DNA involves treatment of the surface with polylysine PPL . In tests involving the fixing of DNA to a plastic surface, biotinylated DNA was denatured and aliquoted into Dynatech, Immulon II removeable wells. Samples were allowed to dry onto the plastic surface at 37 To increase the sensitivity of detection, a fluorogenic substrate, such as 4 methylumbelliferyl phosphate, or its analogues, with companion enzymes, may be used. Additional tests were carried out wherein several aliquots of denatured adenovirus 2 DNA were bound to polystyrene plates as described above. After blocking with Denhardt s formamide blocking buffer, several biotinylated probes were hybridized to the immobilized DNA these were B adeno 2 DNA and lambda DNA. To one set of immobilized DNA, no probe was added. The extent of hybridization was determined by means of the antibody enzyme reaction as described above. It was observed that only the homologous adeno 2 probe hybridized. This technique demonstrated that Polystyrene from various batches or sources exhibits different binding capacities. Previous experiments had demonstrated that addition of duodecadiamine DDA to polystyrene resulted in an uniform binding coefficient of polystyrene plates of different batches. In further tests, radioactively labeled, non biotinylated denatured DNA 2000 ng to 5 ng denatured was applied to DDA coated polystyrene plates. The test samples or plates were not allowed to dry. After incubation at 37 In other tests, polystyrene microfilter wells were nitrated using a procedure of Filipsson and Hornby Biochem J. To produce 6 aminohexane linked polystyrene, 6 aminocaproic acid N hydroxysuccinimide ester hydrobromide 5 mg thereof dissolved in 0.2M dimethylformamide prepared by reacting 6 aminocaproic acid hydrobromide with N hydroxysuccinimide and dicyclohexyl carbodiimide in dimethylformamide and recrystallized from isopropylalcohol was added to 0.1M sodium borate 0.4 ml . Amino derivitized polystyrene microfilter wells filled with this solution were allowed to react at room temperature for 4 hours and then washed thoroughly with distilled water. The resulting treated wells absorbed ³H labeled DNA from aqueous solution at pH less than 9.5. As indicated hereinabove, siliceous substrates, such as glass substrates, and plastic substrates, such as polystyrene substrates, are improved with respect to the capability of fixing or immobilization of DNA thereto by treatment with or by providing thereon a coating of an epoxy resin. For example, glass and polystyrene surfaces are improved with respect to the fixing or immobilization of DNA thereon by treatment of glass or polystyrene surfaces with commercially available epoxy glues, such as a solution of epoxy glue in ethanol 1 percent w v . These epoxy solutions are applied to the glass, e.g. Pyrex, glass surfaces or polystyrene surfaces or wells, and the solvent, ethanol, evaporated thereupon at a temperature of 37 The methods described hereinabove with respect to ELISA like techniques for the colorimetric or photometric determination of the hybridized probes involve enzyme linked reagents which produce a color change in a substrate or a precipitate. Various combinations of enzymes and color producing substrates may be employed. See for example accompanying tables, Table I and Table II, showing the combination of enzymes and chromogens. In Table I, the chromogen found in the substrate is reactive with the enzyme employed to elicit or determine the presence of the non radioactive chemically labeled probe. The superscript notation F indicates that the chromogen fluoresces. In accompanying Table II, there are set forth those chromogens which produce an insoluble product, such as when employed with the avidin streptavidin system. These combinations of enzyme chromogen are particularly useful in ELISA techniques for the determination, both qualitatively and quantitatively, of the hybrid DNA or other genetic material containing the special non radioactive chemically labeled probe in accordance with this invention.
