# Reagent for quantitative determination of water and its use therefor.

## Abstract
A reagent is described for the quantitative determination of water, used together with an iodine containing titrating solution, the reagent containing sulfur dioxide and an anhydrous alkali metal salicylate in methanol, 2 methoxy ethanol or a mixture thereof in a volume ratio of at most 90 10 when a mixture of methanol and 2 methoxy ethanol is used, which has been neutralized with an aliphatic amine for stabilizing the pH value. This reagent is distinguished in that the increase of the blind value is restricted to a very low value even at elevated temperatures.
