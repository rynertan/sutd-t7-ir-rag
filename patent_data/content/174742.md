# Exhaust processor.

## Abstract
An in line exhaust processor includes a housing having an inlet for introducing a combustion product from an engine and an outlet for exhausting filtered or otherwise treated combustion product from the housing. A first substrate is situated in a forward or upstream position within the housing to filter combustion product introduced into the housing through the inlet. A second substrate is situated in an adacent rearward or downstream position within the housing to filter combustion product from at least two sources in the manner explained below. Each substrate includes a cellular structure having opposite inlet and outlet ends and a longitudinal axis. The housing includes a first clam shell portion and a complementary second clam shell portion joined to the first clam shell portion to surround and hold the substrate pair in series. The exhaust processor further includes a bypass channel for diverting a selected portion of the combustion product introduced into the housing through the housing inlet to the second substrate.
