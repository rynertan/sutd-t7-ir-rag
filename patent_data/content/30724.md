# Method and device for carrying out objective measurements on digital speech transmission systems.

## Abstract
The method and the device for effecting objective quality measures on speech transmission apparatuses allow the reproduction of the characteristics of the linear part of a sys tem under test, utilizing only the system input and output signals these characteristics are used to generate a reference signal, obtained from the input signal to the system, with which to compare the output signal of the system, and then to obtain an objective quality measure. This allows elimination of the effects of the linear charac teristics, which affect the objective measure without influenc ing the quality of system performance.
