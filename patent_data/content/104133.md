# Composite tread compounds for improved traction and rolling resistance.

## Abstract
A composite tread 20 has at least a low hysteresis component 24 and a high hysteresis component 26 therein. The components are geometrically arranged such that upon wear, generally more of the high hysteresis compound is exposed as wear progresses which imparts good traction to the life of the tread.
