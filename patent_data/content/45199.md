## Description
Title Apparatus and Method for Closing Reclosable iBa,gs This invention relates to the closing of reclosable bags. In the bag forming, closing, and handling art, it is known to apply a bendable and flexible strip across a bag top to assist in holding filled bags closed, and especially for use in reclosing bags to preserve the contents thereof after initial opening. Such strips are commonly designated as tin ties and normally comprise one or more lengths of bendable metal, such as aluminium or copper, contained within a sheath of plastic or paper material moulded or sealed over the metal. The tin tie strip is affixed atop bag tops so as to provide bendable end segments freely extending beyond the bag side edges. These end segments may be bent around the bag top to hold the bag top folded closed both upon bag filling and by the user after the bag is opened. Although the usefulness of tin tie strips in securing reclosable bags is well established, the packaging industry is lacking a simple and effective way to apply such tin tie strips to bag tops in the course of bag closing operations on a fully mechanized, high speed basis. It is with that feed in mind that the improved machine and process disclosed herein have been developed. This invention is directed to a machine and method for the fully automated, high speed closing of bags with a tin tie strip applied to bags during the closing process in such a way as to accomplish a secure closure that can be reclosed by the tin tie strip after initial opening of the bags to pre serve the contents thereof. The basic objective is achieved by a machine in accordance with the invention which automatically carries out the sequential steps of applying glue to one side wall of the open top of a bag, applying a tin tie strip from a dispensing spool to the bag side wall over the glue and cutting off the tin tie strip with bendable links thereof projecting from the leading and trailing edges of the moving bag. Thereafter, the closing sequence is completed by folding the bag top downwardly in a double fold with the tirS tie strip contained within the multiple folds, gluing the folds in place to the bag side wall by applying glue to the outside surface of the first fold, and thereafter bending the projecting lengths of the tin tie strip around the top of the bag to secure the top closure as the bags are moved through the machine by a conveyor. Applying glue to the outside surface of the first fold, rather than to the bag side wall, advantageously permits the use of a glue dispensing nozzle positioned to dispense a bead of glue directly against the first fold, prior to the second folding operation. The bead of glue on the first fold is brought into contact with the bag side wall by the completion of the second fold to hold the double fold in place. In the preferred machine and process, an automatically actuable scissors type of cut off knife is positioned between a pair of continuously driven feed rollers which apply the tin tie strip to moving bags and a pair of transfer rollers located beyond the cut off knife in the direction of bag travel. The transfer rollers are positioned to grip the bag side walls and the tin tie strip together and thereby pull the ltirl tie along with a moving bag until the knife severs the till tie strip behind the bag trailing edge. The bending of the tin tie lengths projecting from the leading and trailing edges of moving bags is preferably accomplished on a relatively high speed, production line basis by a combination of movable and stationary contact devices. In such a preferred embodiment the leading edge tin tie length is first bent around the bag top in two steps. A member mounted for rotary movement across the path of bag travel first strikes the leading edge tin tie length and displaces it angularly with respect to the bag side walls.Thereafter, stationary guide means, positioned at a location to be struck by the angularly projecting leading edge tin tie length, flattens it rearwardly against the bag. The trailing edge of the tin tie length is subsequently bent and flattened back against moving bags in two steps by a rotary member intermittently movable across the path of moving bags and by a moving belt positioned adjacent to the bag conveyor downstream of the rotary strike member. The rotary member first displaces the trailing edge tin tie lengths to an angularly projecting position with respect to the bag side walls. The moving belt is angled inwardly towards the bag conveyor with respect to the position of bag travel, and is driven in a direction generally coinciding with the direction of bag movement, but at a greater linear speed than that of the bag conveyor. The moving belt is thus particularly effective to engage the angularly projecting trailing edge tin tie length, and progressively flatten it against the top of moving bags to complete a full 1800 turn. The invention will now be further described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figures la and ib comprise together a top, plan view of the apparatus of this invention Figure 2 is a section view taken along lines 2 2 ofFigure 1b and showing the first glue applicator Figure 3 is a section view taken along lines 3 3 ofFigure Ib and showing the tin tie feed rollers Figure 4 is a section view taken along lines 4 4 ofFigure 1b and showing the cut off knife assembly for the tid tie Figure 5 is a section view taken along lines 5 5 ofFigure ib and showing the first bag folder Figure 6 is a section view taken along lines 6 6 ofFigure la and showing the second glue applicator Figure 7 is a section view taken along lines 7 7 ofFigure la and showing the second bag folder Figure 8 is a section view taken along lines 8 8 ofFigure la and showing the rotary arm assemblies for bending the tin tie strip applied to the bag Figure 9 is a section view taken along lines 9 9 ofFigure 8 and showing the first rotary arm assembly Figure 10 is a fragmentary, top plan view taken along lines 10 10 of Figure 8 at the first rotary arm assembly Figure 11 is a fragmentary top plan view taken along lines 11 11 of Figure 8 at the second, rotary arm assembly Figure 12 is a fragmentary, enlarged view taken at the point indicated on Figure 1a and showing the belt assembly utilized for final flattening of the trailing tid tie projection on a bag being closed and Figure 13 is an enlarged scale section view of a bag as illustrated in Figure 7 after the second folding operation of the bag top has been completed. The machine has been particularly developed for use in the final closing of filled bags. Filled bags are transported to the input side of the machine as shown at the far right side ofFigure 1b, after which the bags are carried through the machine, which automatically applies a tid tie strip and closes the bags.Although different types of bags, including plastic bags, may possibly be processed by this machine, it is contemplated that its primary application will be to the closing of gusseted, paper bags containing perishable items such as coffee and cookies. With reference to Figure 1b, filled bags are intially introduced into the machine between a pair of guide housings 1 where the bag neck is gripped between a pair of flat, stainless steel carrier chains 8. Chains 8 extend over substantially the entire length of the machine, and are closely spaced apart about supporting sprockets so as to firmly grip the opposite sides of the bag neck as illustrated in Figures 2 through 7. Chains 8 are driven continuously and carry bags through the machine as the tin tie application and bag closing steps are performed in a predetermined sequence. As a preliminary step the gusseted, paper bags are trimmed at the top by a pair of rotary trimming discs 4. These disc blades act like scissors to shear each bag top off straight to the correct height for folding properly. Scrap material severed from the top of moving bags is discharged through chute 6. After the bag trimming step, a pneumatically actuated glue applicator 10 positioned as shown in Figures 1b and 2 is utilized to apply a first head of glue horizontally across the face of one side of each bag. Glue is precisely metered through discharge nozzle 12 of glue applicator 10. Closely spaced guide plates 14 having upstanding portions as shown support the opposite sides of the bag neck as glue is applied thereto. As may best be understood by reference to Figure 2, carrier chains 8 are supported above a deck 16 apertured as shown to receive the neck 22 of moving bags 20. The front side wall of each bag neck 22, as viewed from in front of the machine with respect to Figures 1a and 1b, is indicated by reference numeral 22a, and numeral 22b indicates the opposed, rear side wall.Glue dispensing nozzle 12 is located so as to apply a narrow strip or bead of glue across bag side wall 22a near the top of the bag. This first bead of glue is placed on the bag side wall so as to coincide with the centreline of a tin tie strip subsequently applied thereover. A pair of guide plates 18 shaped and positioned similarly to those shown at 14 serve to guide moving bags between a pair of tin tie feed rollers 24 and 26 after the glue bead is applied.Rollers 24 and 26 may be driven in any convenient manner. In practice, input power to feed rollers 24 and 26 is provided by a drive chain 28 driven from a power takeoff and speed reducer 30 connected to a main power input shaft 31. As may best be understood by reference to Figures ib and 3, feed roller 24 is mounted on a shaft 32 carrying a sprocket 34 about which drive chain 28 is guided.A gear drive 36 in turn transmits power from shaft 32 to shaft 38 on which knurled feed roller 26 is mounted. Till tie ribbon 39 supplied from a spool 40 is gripped between feed rollers 24 and 26, and pulled forward against side wall 22a of moving bags over the first glue bead. Tin tie ribbon 39 is fed from spool 40 to an intermediate feed and guide roll assembly 42 and thence into a flexible guide tube 44 from which it is picked up by feed rollers 24 and 26. The drive and mounting arrangement for feed rollers 24 and 26 is such that these rollers are driven continuously. A power cylinder 45 connected to knurled feed roller 26 through shaft 38 and its bearing block 47 serves to move this roller laterally inwardly and outwardly into and out of co operative, tin 1 tie feeding engagement with backup roller 24.This lateral, shifting movement of feed roller 26 is indicated by arrows in Figure 3. As tiri tie ribbon 39 is gripped by feed rollers 24 and 26 and fed fowardly against bag face 22a over the glue bead, its free leading end is picked up and gripped between a pair of transfer rollers 46 and 48 positioned downstream of feed rollers 24 and 26 in the direction of bag travel. Transfer rollers 46 and 48 are driven from chain 28 through a sprocket and gear arrangement substantially the same as that used for feed rollers 24 and 26. Transfer rollers 46 and 48 are constructed and positioned to grip moving bags, and the tin tie ribbon 39, the same as rollers 24 and 26 as shown in Figure 3.Tension is maintained on the tin tie ribbon 39 until it is cut off by the gripping and pulling action of transfer rollers 46 and 48. The cutting of the tid tie ribbon to leave a predetermined length of tin tie extending across the width of each bag neck is accomplished by a cut off knife assembly 50. As is shown inFigures 1b and 4, the knife assembly is actuated by a power cylinder 52 having a piston 54 coupled to a linkage mechanism 56.This linkage mechanism is in turn connected to pivotal knife blade 58. A stationary knife blade 60 is positioned to co operate with movable blade 58 to provide a scissors type of cut off action.Movable blade 58 pivots about point 62 through the reciprocal actuation of piston 54 and link 56. When piston 54 is retracted in the direction indicated by the arrow in Figure 4, blade 58 is pivoted to the phantom line position shown in Figure 4 in its cutting stroke. Power cylinders 45 and 52 for tid tie feeding actuation of roller 26 and operation of cut off knife assembly 50 are controlled by an electric eye arrangement not shown so that the tin tie strip applied to each bag will have bendable lengths thereof projecting beyond leading and trailing edges of the bag. Beyond transfer rollers 46 and 48 in the direction of bag travel are another pair of guide plates 64 which direct the moving bag with a tin tie strip 39a applied thereto into a first bag top folder 66. Folder 66 is of a conventional, well known construction. Preferably, it comprises an inverted U shaped folding plate as shown in Figure 5. Folding plate 5 inclines downwardly from right to left as viewed in Figure 1 to progressively fold the top of each moving bag over and impart a first fold thereto.Figure 5 shows the top of a bag 20 folded downwardly over the face of side wall 22a to provide a first fold 68 with tiri tie strip 39a lying between this first fold and bag side wall 22a. A set of compression rollers 70 serve to compress and flatten first fold 68. Rollers 70 are driven by a chain 71 from a power take off 69 which also receives its driving power from shaft 31. A second pneumatically actuated glue applicator 72 having a dispensing nozzle 74 is positioned as shown in Figures 1a and 6 beyond compression rollers 70. Guide plates 76 located adjacent to glue applicator 72 serve to support bag neck 22 as glue is applied thereto from nozzle 74. Dispensing nozzle 74 is located to apply a second bead of glue to the outside surface of first fold 68 adjacent the top thereof as indicated at 75 in Figure 6. Thereafter, a second folder 78 of identical construction as first folder 66 and shown in Figures 1a and 7 engages the top of moving bags 20 to fold the top thereof downwardly a second time.The second fold 80 formed by folder 78 is shown in Figures 7 and 13.As may be noted most clearly by reference to Figure 13, the second folding operation brings first fold 68 into a position lying against bag side wall 22a with second glue bead 75 located therebetween.Thus, second glue bead 75 serves to hold the bag top in the double folded condition shown in Figure 13. Also, the first glue bead holdingtwtintttie strip 39a to first fold 68 is indicated by reference numeral 73 in Figure 13. Tin tie strip 39a is contained as shown between bag top folds 68 and 80. The tin tie ribbon utilized is flexible material, and as shown in Figure 13 may comprise a strip of plastic having a pair of wires 79 and 81 embedded in top and bottom longitudinal segments thereof. Tin tie strip 39a is preferably on the order of s i 6s of an inch wide and has wire strands 79 and 81 moulded therein. As stated above tin tie strip 39a will have bendable lengths or segments thereof projecting from the leading and trailing edges of bag neck 22. These projecting tin tie segments must be folded back flat against the top of bag neck 22. This is accomplished by a combination of elements comprising in part a pair of rotary arm assemblies generally indicated by reference numerals 82 and 84 in Figures la, 8 and 9. These arm assemblies are of identical construction, and serve to initially bend or turn the projecting ends of the tin tie strip 900 from the vertical plane of the upright bag neck 22. Rotary arm assemblies 82 and 84 are rotatably mounted on a shaft 86, and are driven by a sprocket and chain drive arrangement not shown from an intermediate drive shaft 88.Power is supplied to shaft 88 by a drive chain 90 from a power takeoff and speed reducer 92 drivingly coupled to main drive shaft 31. Rotary arm assemblies 82 and 84 are identical.Each carries a pair of paddles or arms 94a, 94b and 96a, 96b, respectively. It is to be noted by reference to Figures 8 and 9 that rotary arms 94a, 94b and 96a, 96b are mounted for rotary movement across the path of travel of bags being transported by carrier or conveyor chains 8. These rotary arms revolve in a generally vertical plane oriented transversely to the direction of travel of conveyor chains 8. First rotor assembly 82 is located along the path of bag travel so that one of its rotary arms 94a or 94b will strike leading edge tid tie length 98 and bend it as illustrated in Figures 8, 9 and 10. The action of rotary arm 94b as illustrated in Figures 9 and 10 is effective to bend leading 0 edge tid tie length 98 to substantially a 90 angle with respect to the vertical plane of bag side walls 22a and 22b. Located immediately beyond rotary arm assembly 82 in the direction of bag travel is a stationary guide comprised of a pair of upright plates 102. Stationary guide 102 is shown inFigures 8, 1G and 11. The space between upright guide plates 102 is such that bag neck 22 can just pass therebetween. Thus, as bag neck 22 enters the space between stationary guide plate 102, angularly extending, leading edge tin tie projection 98 strikes one of the upright plates 102 and is flattened rearwardly into overlying 0 position against bag neck rear wall 22b to complete a full 180 turn. Trailing edge ti tie projection 100 remains straight as it passes between upright guide plates 102. Rotary arm assembly 84 is located downstream of stationary guide 102 in the direction of bag travel so that its rotary arms 96a and 96b are in a position to strike trailing edge tin tie projection 100. As illustrated inFigures 8 and 11, this occurs after a bag neck 22 passes rotary arm assembly 84. Rotary arm 96b is shown in Figures 8 and 11 striking trailing edge tin tie projection 100 and deflecting it to a 0 substantially 90 angle with respect to the vertical plane of bag neck side walls 22a and 22b. The final flattening of trailing edge tin tie projection 100 is accomplished by a rough belt 104 located downstream of rotary arm assembly 84. Belt 104 is guided around shivs 106 and 108 so as to be supported at an angle with respect to guide chains 8 and the path of bag travel as shown in Figures la and 12. Mounting plate 110 for belt shivs 106 and 108 is pivotally supported at one end on a pivot block 12 for swinging, pivotal movement in a horizontal plane about pivot pin connection 114. The other end of mounting plate 110 is connected to the reciprocating piston 118 of a rigidly mounted power cylinder 116.The purpose of power cylinder 116 and its piston 118 is to pivot belt 104 inwardly and outwardly about pivot point 114 with respect to the path of bag travel so as to avoid contact of belt 104 with leading edge tin tie projection 98 and the resultant damaging or reopening of that projection. The intermittent actuation of power cylinder 116 is controlled by an electric eye located so as to not activate power cylinder 116 for the extension of piston 118 and the pivotal movement of belt 104 to the position shown in Figures 1a and 12 until after the leading edge tin tie projection 98 has passed by the belt 104. Belt 104 is traveiling in the direction indicated by the directional arrow in Figure 12 at a linear speed which is greater than that at which bags 20 are being conveyed by carrier chains 8.This difference in speed and the angular orientation of belt 104 as shown most clearly in Figure 12 causes trailing edge tin tie projection 100 to be progressively flattened by belt 104. In Figure 12 projection 100 is shown fully flattened against the rear side wall 22b of a bag neck 22 after its full 1800 turn has been completed by moving belt 104. After a bag 20 has passed belt 104, piston 118 of power cylinder 116 is automatically retracted by the aforesaid electric eye so as to swing belt 104 out of the way to clear leading edge tin tie projection 98 of the next bag passing by. Generally indicated by reference numeral 121 at the output end of the machine in Figure la is a coder assembly. This assembly functions through the use of an ink wheel, type wheel and rubber backup roll to code the top, folded area of the bag. The operational sequence as set forth above comprises the initial steps of trimming the bag top, applying a first glue bead 73 to one bag side wall by glue applicator 10, and then applying a tin tie strip 39a over glue bead 10. After a first top fold 68 is formed by folder 66, a second glue bead 75 is applied to the outside surface thereof as shown in Figure 6, and the bag top is folded down a second time at folder 78. The double folded bag top with glue beads 73 and 75 is shown clearly in Figure 13. Applying glue bead 75 to the top, outside surface of the first fold 68 allows the convenient placement of nozzle 74 close to this bag surface.It is difficult to get a glue nozzle sufficiently close to moving bags, under first fold 68, to apply the second glue bead 75 directly to the surface of bag side wall 22a against which first fold 68 is folded. The tin tie strip is securely retained between folds 68 and 80 as shown in Figure 13. Thereafter the bag closing process is completed by bending leading and trailing tin tie projections 98 and 100 0 through full 180 turns by means of rotary arm assemblies 82 and 84, stationary guide 102, and belt flattener 104. The positioning of stationary guide 102 between rotary arm assemblies 82 and 84 ensures that angularly deflected leading edge tin tie projection 98 is flattened back against the bag top before trailing edge tin tie 0 projection 100 is deflected outwardly 90 by the second rotary arm assembly 84. Bendable tin tie lengths 98 and 100 extend beyond the leading and trailing edges of bag neck 22 approximately W to X of an inch. This is accomplished by the use of a control arrangement including cylinder 45 and an electric eye not shown positioned adjacent to the feed rollers 24 and 26. When the eye senses an approaching bag, air cylinder 45 is activated to extend its piston 43 and shift knurled wheel shaft 38 inwardly towards shaft 32. Piston 43 is attached to bearing block 47 supporting shaft 38 as shown inFigure 3. The closing of rollers 24 and 26 will start the feeding of tin tie ribbon 39 from spool 40 in front of the leading edge of the bag. As the bag passes the electric eye, cylinder 45 will retract to stop the feeding of tin tie ribbon. Simultaneously, cylinder 52 for cut off knife 50 is actuated and a strip of tiS tie 39a is cut off. The control timing is such that movable knife blade 58 operates intermittently to sever the tin tie ribbon with bendable length 100 projecting rearwardly beyond the bag trailing edge. The application of a reclosable tin tie strip to filled bags during closing as disclosed herein reduces bag and closing costs in comparison to the use of special bags with preapplied tin ties. The above described apparatus and process permits the high speed application of tin tie strips and the closing of bags at speeds on the order of seventy bags per minute, depending on bag width.
