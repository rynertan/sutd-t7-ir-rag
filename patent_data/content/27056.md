# A circuit for extending the range of operation of an electromagnetic fuel injector.

## Abstract
A method for extending the range of operation of an electromagnetic fuel injector for an internal combustion engine employs a technique for reducing the time required for the injector to open while at the same time allowing the injector to maintain a minimum closing time. Prior art techniques have utilized a regulated voltage supply to deter mine the precise voltage applied to the inductive element of the injector to cause it to open. The present invention does not regulate the applied voltage, but instead the invention allows an unregulated battery or other DC supply voltage to be applied to the inductive element to cause the injector to open as rapidly as possible. The current in the injector is sensed to allow a reduction in the applied voltage when a predetermined maximum current occurs in the inductive element. The voltage reduction permits a holding current to be established in the inductive element to maintain the injector open. The holding current is low to reduce the time required to close the injector.
