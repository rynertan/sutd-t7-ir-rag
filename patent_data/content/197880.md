# Radiating sleeve for catalytic reaction apparatus.

## Abstract
Tubular catalytic reactors within a furnace are each sur rounded by a radiator having an inner cylindrical surface spaced from the reactor defining a flow path for the furnace gases. The inner surface of the radiator has a plurality of adjacent helical channels formed therein extending the length of the conduit. Heat from the furnace gases travelling through the flow path is picked up by the radiators by convection and radiated to the reactor. The helical grooves improve heat transfer efficiency and circumferential uniformity of heating with minimum pressure drop and they prevent the cut off of heat to localized areas of the reactor in case of contact be tween the reactor and radiator walls.
