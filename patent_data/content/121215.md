# Catheter.

## Abstract
A catheter or fiberscope for the inspection of an intracar diac area or the like is proposed which has a flexible tube 1 and a balloon 8 mounted on its end. The flexible tube is divided into four passageways, i.e. two fluid passageways and an illumination light transmission line and an image transmission line. A flush of a physiological saline solution 12 is spouted from one fluid passageway outside of the balloon to form a visual field without interfering natural movement of the area 14 to be inspected. A catheter for dissolving a thrombus is also proposed which has a porous tube, instead of a balloon, at its end portion.
