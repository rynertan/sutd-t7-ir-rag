## Description
BINARY CODE ASSEMBLYBackground of the Invention The present invention relates generally to the field of binary code assemblies wherein components are assembled or adjusted to create a predetermined binary code through the selective interconnection of conductors.The present invention is more specifically related to such binary code assemblies which are user programmable which means that the binary code can be altered by the user from one code to another. A number of different binary code assemblies and programmable binary code assemblies are known. The majority of these assemblies comprise dual in line integrated circuit packages and their mating sockets, and the majority of these are non proqrammable in that once the device has been modified to provide a predetermihed binary code, the device cannot be readily altered so that a different predetermined binary code can be implemented. Programmable binary code assemblies which were previously known either had limited proqrammability, and or were programmable only with the assistance of special tools such as requiring solder bridging to reconneet previously sheared conductor paths, and or comprised complex and costly mechanical structures which would make these assemblies unfeasible for use in consumer product applications wherein the cost of the code assembly must be minimized. Summary of the Invention An object of the present invention is to provide an improved binary code assembly which overcomes the deficiencies of the prior art assemblies noted above. A more particular object of the present invention is to provide an improved binary code assembly which is inexpensive, contains relatively few components, can be assembled without the use of special tools, and is readily user programmable to alter the binary code without the use of special tools. In one embodiment of the present invention, a binary code assembly is provided comprising a circuit board having a plurality of isolated conductor paths thereon metallic conductor means having a main metallic body and a plurality of individual metallic spring fingers extend ing from said metallic body and electrically connected thereto, said metallic connector means mounted on said circuit board with each spring finqer positioned adjacent to an associated one of said isolated circuit board conductor paths, said connector means mounted such that each of said spring fingers normally matingly electrically and mechanically contacts its associated conductor path via the mechanical bias provided by the spring finger and insulating means comprising a relatively thin sheet of insulating material, a portion of said sheet being inserted into a fixed position between said connector means and said circuit board, said insulating means formed to provide for the selective interconnection of some of the circuit board conductor paths while maintaining other of said circuit board conductor paths isolated by said inserted portion being interposed between these conductor paths and their associated spring fingers, thereby creating a binary code through the selective shorting together of said some of said circuit board conductor paths. Preferably, a standard component normally utilized as a flat cable connector clamp is mounted to a conventional printed circuit board having a plurality of conductor metallizations forming the conductive paths referred to above. The cable clamp has a number of spring fingers which will normally contact associated conductor metallizations on the printed circuit board.To this two component assembly a portion of a flat sheet of insulating material is interposed therebetween to provide for the selective isolating of some of the spring finqers from their associated conductor metallizations.Preferably, the inserted portion of the flat insulating sheet comprises a number of insulating fingers which can be readily manually bent such that the user can determine, prior to the insertion of the flat sheet, which of the spring fingers should be isolated from their associated conductor metallizations. In this manner, the binary code assembly of the present invention is readily manually programmable. Additional features of the present invention are that a binary code assembly is provided which consists of only three elements all of which are of a simplified construction and are relatively inexpensive. Preferably the insulating sheet is formed from a Mylar sheet of 5 15 mils. thousands of an inch in thickness. Also, preferably the cable clamp connector has locating projections which mate with notches in the insulating sheet to hold the sheet in place once it has been inserted between the printed circuit board and the cable clamp. In addition, it is contemplated that the sprinq fingers of the cable clamp will be formed such that they provide a curved surface adjacent to the point of contact between them and their associated printed circuit conductor metallization such that the insertion of the portion of the insulating sheet between these elements is facilitated. Through the use of the above recited structural limitations for the binary code assembly of the present invention, as well as due to other structural limitations to be described hereinafter, the present invention has provided a binary code assembly which is vastly superior to previous known assemblies with regard to cost, ease of assembly, complexity, and ease of adjusting the assembly to provide various different binary codes programmability .Brief Description of the Drawinqs For a more complete understanding of the present invention, reference should be made to the drawings, in which FIG. 1 is an exploded perspective view of the binary code assembly of the present invention FIG. 2 is a perspective view of the components inFIG. 1 after partial assembly FIG. 3 is a perspective view of the components inFIGS. 1 and 2 after complete assembly FIG. 4 is a cross sectional view of the completed assembly show in FIG. 3 taken along the lines 4 4 FIG. 5 is a cross sectional view of the completed assembly shown in FIG.4 taken along the lines 5 5 apd FIG. 6 is a perspective view of an alternate embodiment for one of the components of the binary code assembly shown in FIGS. 1 3.Description of the Preferred Embodiments FIG. 1 illustrates a binary code assembly 10 which basically comprises a printed circuit board 11 having a plurality of isolated conductor metallizations 12 thereon and a surrounding outer conductor metallization 13, a metallic connector 14 having a metal chassis which includes connector sides 14a, a main metallic body 15 and a plurality of individual metallic spring fingers 16 extending from the main body, and an insulating element comprising a relatively thin sheet 17 of insulating material havin g a portion 17a intended to be inserted between the connector 14 and the printed circuit board 11.The connector 14 is contemplated as preferably having four downward extending mounting tab projections 18 which are to be received in and throuqh corresponding holes 19 in the printed circuit board so as to mount the connector 14 to the printed circuit board. While the present invention preferably utilizes a printed circuit board 11 of conventional construction having copper conductive metallizations, other types of circuit boards can be utilized. These circuit boards could comprise for example, any insulating base substrate with a plurality of conductive paths thereon, wherein these paths can be formed with conductive carbon ink. The subassembly comprising the connector 14 mounted to the printed circuit board 11 prior to the insertion of the portion 17a of the insulating sheet 17 is illustrated in FIG. 2. The metallic connector 14 is mounted to the printed circuit board 11 such that each of the flexible metallic spring fingers 16 is positioned adjacent toy an associated one of the plurality of isolated printed circuit board metallizations 12 such that each of the spring fingers 16 will normally matingly electrically and mechanically contact just its associated conductor metallization via mechanical spring bias which is provided by the spring finger. It should be noted that after the connector 14 is fixed to the printed circuit board 11, it is contemplated that the metallic chassis of the connector, which includes the main metallic body 15 and the spring fingers 16, will always be electrically connected to one of the printed circuit board metallizations 12 by virtue of a single one 30 of the fingers 16 always mechanically contacting this metallization regardless of the electrical connections formed by the other sprinq fingers 16. This technique eliminates the need to solder the connector 14 to the printed circuit hoard 11. This a connection could also be made by the mechanical contact of the sides 14a of the connector 14 to the metallization 13 or via a solder connection.Due to the aforedescribed construction of the connector 14 and printed circuit board 11, it should be clear that all of the metallizations 12 on the printed circuit board will be connected together after the assembly of the connector 14 to the printed circuit board 11. Preferably, the sheet 17 of insulating material comprises at least one set of a plurality of individual flexible extendinq finqers 20 which extend outward from a central carrier strip portion 21 of the insulatinq sheet 17 and form the portion 17a to be inserted between the connector 14 and the printed circuit board. Each of the insulating fingers 20 is dimensioned such that it is capable of forming an insulating barrier between one of the sprinq fingers 16 and its associated conductor metallization 12 when the sheet portion 17a is inserted between the metallic connector means 14 and the printed circuit board 11. It is also contemplated that each of the insulating fingers 20 is capable of being selectively manually bent, prior to the insertion of the sheet portion 17a between the connector 14 and printed circuit board 11, such that after insertion the bent finger will be positioned so as to permit electrical contact between the associated spring finger and conductor metallization which would have been isolated if the extending finder had not been bent. Conversely, it is contemplated that a previously bent finger 20 may be manually straightened prior to insertion of the portion 17a. Preferably, the insulating sheet is apProximately 5 to 15 mils. thousandths of an inch in thickness and comprises a sheet of flexible polyester material such as Mylar.When the insulating sheet and extending flexible fingers are formed of such a material in the preferred thickness, it has been found that the flexible fingers can be bent and straightened many times without adverse effects, thus allowing substantial user programming of the binary code assembly 10. FIG. 3 illustrates the completely assembled binary code assembly 10 wherein a number of the programmable fingers 20 of the sheet 17 have been inserted between the connector 14 and the plurality of conductor metallizations 12 on the printed circuit board 11. It should be noted that the metallic connector 14 has a pair of peripheral upstanding locating projections 22 which mate with locating notches 23 formed in the insulating sheet 17 so as to fix the position of the insulating sheet 17 with respect to the connector 14 after the insertion of the sheet portion 17a between the connector and printed circuit board. This also prevents any inadvertent shifting of the insulating sheet 17 with respect to the assembly due to vibration of the finished assembly. It should be noted that the connector 14 is preferably contemplated as comprising a standard flat cable connector clip number 62871 manufactured by the AMPCompany of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, USA. Normally, the AP connector clip is utilized to provide a plurality of individual spring finger mechanical biases to the backside of conductors on a flat cable to insure a pressure mechanical and electrical contact between these cable conductors and mating printed circuit board metallizations. Thus, the normal use of the AMP connector clip does not provide a binary code assembly according to the teachings of the present invention, and certainly does not provide a programmable binary code assembly according to the teachings of the present invention. The insulatinq sheet 17 illustrated in FIGS. 1 through 3, comprises the central solid carrier strip area 21 and two sets of pluralities of flexible fingers which B extend outward in opposite directions from this central solid area. One of these sets of flexible fingers comprise the fingers 20 of the portion 17a as described previously and another set of identical flexible fingers 24 is illustrated as extending in substantially the opposite direction to the fingers 20 and comprising a portion 17b. Either of the portions 17a or 17b can be utilized for insertion between the connector 14 and the printed circuit board 11. The directions of extension referred to are taken prior to any selective bending of any of the extending fingers wherein in a non bent state of the flexible finqers, the configuration of the insulating sheet 17 is substantially planar. FIG. 6 illustrates an alternative embodiment for the insulating sheet 17 wherein a sheet 25 illustrated therein comprises one set of flexible extending fingers 26 which extend in a first direction and a selectively notched portion 27 of the sheet 25 extending in an opposite direction wherein the selectively notched portion of the sheet corresponds to a fixed nonprogrammable binary code. Through the use of the insulatinq sheet 25 shown in FIG. 6, either a predetermined fixed binary code can be implemented or any desired binary code can be implemented depending upon whether either the notched portion 27 or the programmable extendinq finqers 26 are inserted between the spring fingers 16 and the conductor metallizations 12 on the printed circuit board. FIG. 5 illustrates that preferably each of the spring fingers 16 has a curved surface 28 which is located adjacent to each printed circuit board conductor metallization 12 associated with a spring finger 16. The purpose of the curved surface 28 is to facilitate the insertion of a portion of the sheet 17 or 25 between the spring fingers 16 and the conductor metallizations 12 when this is desired. The curved surface 28 facilitates this insertion by forming a desired cam surface which will be contacted by an end of the insulating sheet 17 or 25 upon insertion of portions of these sheets between the connector 14 and printed circuit board 11.It should also be noted that preferably a special tool may be used to simultaneously lift the spring fingers 15 by inserting a plate in the rear of the connector 14 so as to latch the end portion 29 of the fingers 16 and lift them to aid in the insertion and removal of the sheet 17. It should be noted that preferably either the metallization 12 contacted by the finger 30 or the surrounding conductor metallization 13 is connected to aDCreference potential such as ground which thereby provides for grounding the entire metal chassis of the connector 14 which includes the main body portion 15 and individual spring fingers 16. Thus, the present binary code assembly provides for the selective grounding of any of the desired conductor metallizations 12 to provide any desired binary code. Codes implemented by the present invention are readily alterable proqrammable by merely withdrawing the portions of the insulating sheet 17 or 25 from between the connector 14 and printed circuit board 11 and subsequently reinserting the sheet with differ ent ones of the flexible extending fingers 20 or 26 being bent. While binary code assemblies such as the assembly described herein can be used for a number of different purposes, it is contemplated that preferably the binary code assembly of the present invention is used to establish a desired predetermined code for receiver and transmitter devices such as for electronic garaqe door openers. While I have shown and described specific embodiments of this invention, further modifications and improvements will occur to those skilled in the art. All such modifications which retain the basic underlying principles disclosed and claimed herein are within the scope of this inv entlon. I claim
