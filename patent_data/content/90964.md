# Multi layer ceramic capacitor structure and method for making same.

## Abstract
The multi layer ceramic capacitor structure 1 is capable of embodying multiple capacitors of various maximum voltage and capacitance rating. The structure 1 features a ceramic body 2 including multiple sections 3 having a dielectric element 4A, B, C and companion plate 5A, B, C of one or more types, the types defined by the number and placement of plate tabs 8A, B, C . The sections 3 are aligned in the body 2 such that the plates 5A, B, C are located at displaced intervals in the direction of the body length while the plate tabs 8A, B, C are located at displaced intervals in the direction of the body width and exposed at a common body face 11 . Grooves 17 are provided in the common face 11 to align tabs 8A, B, C in groups and to maintain the groups separated. Grooves 17 have the effect that the maximum voltage the structure 1 can withstand is not reduced due to mis alignment of tabs 8A, B, C during formation of body 2 . Buses 12A, B, C interconnect the tabs 8A, B, C and plates 5A, B, C in groups at common face 11 . By selectively connecting the buses 12A, B, C , one or more capacitors may be formed in body 2 . The method features steps for grooving the common face 11 and simultaneously aligning tabs 8A, B, C in body 2 .
