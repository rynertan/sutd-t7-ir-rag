# WASTE TRANSFER PACKERS

## Abstract
A waste transfer packer having a horizontally reciprocable ram operating in a hollow spigot to deliver and compress waste material from a chute or hopper, has a spigot adapted to extend into a container through a pair of doors hinged about horizontal axes. Problems can arise on disconnection of the container from the packer due to re expansion of the load within the con tainer. The invention provides a spigot extending almost to the position of maximum penetration of the ram so as to continue to support the load while the ram is withdrawn and during disconnection of the container. The spigot shape can provide a sloping or stepped support by a suitable profiling of the spigot front face.
