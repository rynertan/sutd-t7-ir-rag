# A baseline transposition and character segmenting method for printing.

## Abstract
Characters are encoded in digital data, and this data is then used to modulate a display to image the characters. Characters are typically displayed on a display baseline which corresponds to the physical character baseline encoded in data. Where the distance of a character from its physical baseline in a first dimension exceeds the boundary limit of a display, the location of the character baseline and the display physical baseline corresponding thereto may be shifted in the opposite direction and in the same dimension in extent equal to the amount said character exceeds the display and until the character fits within the display. Alter nately, where the character at its display size is larger than the display in any display dimension, the character may be segmented into parts and logical baselines inserted into each separate section. These logical baselines may be referenced to the character physical baseline relative to the distance in a first dimension therebetween. Accordingly, the logical baseline may be referenced to the character physical baseline and the display baseline to appropriately locate the character relative to the physical baseline, so that when the separate sections are reassembled on the display, the origi nal character is reproduced.
