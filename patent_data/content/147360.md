## Description
This invention relates to the art of bonding between ceramics and metals. Broadly, known methods of bonding ceramics and metals together include 1 an adhesive method, 2 a metallizing method and 3 a spray coating method. However, these methods have the following drawbacks. In respect to the above general description of prior arts attention is drawn to US PS 32 96 017 which discloses a method of chemically bonding a metal to a ceramic. Said method includes the steps of applying a fluid suspension of a powder mixture consisting of a transition metal oxide and a refractory metal on the ceramic body and firing the coated body at about 1.600 1.800 C in flowing anhydrous hydrogen. An other method ist known from US PS 34 03 043. Said metallising process uses a lower firing temperature well below the melting point of any constituent. It is the task of the present invention to increase the bonding strength and to avoid the liability to cracks. According to the invention, there is provided a method for bonding oxide ceramics aid metals with a combination of steps as mentioned in claim 1 resp. 2 which totally result in better characteristics explained below, in detail. The method of the invention can be applied to the manufacture of paper making machines, injection molding machines and other various machines. Figs. 1 A through 1 D are a schematic view illustrating the steps of a method embodying the present invention. Reference is now made to the drawing in which reference numeral 1 indicates an oxide ceramic such as Al₂O₃, ZrO₂ or the like and reference numeral 2 indicates a metal being bonded to the ceramic. Reference numeral 3 designates a composite insert material made of oxides and metals and reference numeral 4 indicates a brazing material whose melting point is lower than the melting point of the insert material 3. The insert material is made of at least one oxide selected from Cu₂O, SiO₂, AgO, Al₂O₃, TiO₂, ZnO, AuO, ZrO₂, WO₂, MgO, CaO and at least one metal selected from Cu, Ni, Si, Fe, Ag, Al, Ti, Zn, Au, Co, Zr, Ta, Nb and Mg. The at least one metal should contain not less than 5 wt in the insert material. The brazing material is, for example, solder, Al, Ag, Cu, Ni and the like solders. In Fig. 1 A , the composite insert material 3 is fixedly deposited on the ceramic 1 by ion plating or spray coating step A . Subsequently, the resulting sub assembly is subjected to thermal reaction promoting processing in Fig. 1 B step B , followed by diffusion welding with the bonding metal 2 step C or brazing, as 4, as in Fig. 1 D step D . The ion plating of step A is carried out as follows. Metals which are constituents of the composite insert material, e.g. Cu, Al, Si, Mg, Ca, and the like, are placed in a crucible and melted and evaporated for the ion plating. In this connection, it should be noted that the atmosphere for the ion plating is alternately changed between vacuum and oxygen atmospheres. As a principle, an initial layer is formed in an oxygen atmosphere and a final layer is in a vacuum atmosphere. More particularly, a metal layer is formed in the vacuum atmosphere and a metal oxide layer is formed in the oxygen atmosphere, by which a composite insert material of a laminate structure comprising oxide and metal layers, e.g. Cu₂O Cu, Al₂O₃ Al or the like, is fixedly deposited on the ceramic. Metal constituents for an intended composite insert material, e.g. Cu, Al, Si, Mg, Ca, or the like, are placed in a crucible and fused and evaporated. In this connection, the ion plating is effected by a procedure which comprises, after evacuation, feeding a predetermined amount of oxygen into a chamber in order to oxidize part of the metal heated and evaporated. As a result, a composite insert material having a predetermined ratio of the oxide and metal Cu ₂O Cu, Al₂O₃ Al or the like combination is deposited on the ceramic. Two crucible are provided in order that a metal e.g. Cu, Al or the like which should be converted into a corresponding oxide is placed in one crucible and a metal which should remain unchanged as a metal constituent for an intended composite insert material is placed in the other crucible. The respective metals are fused and evaporated for ion plating. In this connection, the ion plating atmosphere should be alternately changed between oxygen and vacuum atmospheres. As a principle, an initial layer is formed in an oxygen atmosphere and a final layer is formed in a vacuum layer. For example, when a metal constituent for the composite insert material e.g. Ni, Cu or the like is fused and evaporated in a vacuum atmosphere and a metal e.g. Ni, Cu or the like converted into a corresponding oxide is evaporated in an oxygen atmosphere, the former metal is ion plated as it is e.g. Cu, Al or the like and the latter metal is ion plated as an oxide e.g. Cu₂O, Al₂O₃ or the like . As a result, a composite insert material having a laminate structure of the oxide metal e.g. Cu₂O Ni, Al₂O₃ Ni, Al₂O₃ Cu or the like is deposited on the ceramic. On the other hand, with spray coating, plasma spray coating techniques are used. In such techniques, a mixed powder of oxide and metal powders is spray coated in a non oxidative atmosphere to deposit a composite insert material 3 of oxide metal on the ceramic. The thermal reaction promoting processing step B is effected in order to increase the bonding strength between the ion plated or spray coated composite insert material 3 and the ceramic 1. In this step, the insert bearing ceramic is heated in an inert gas or in vacuo at a time over 5 minutes at temperatures of from 1 3 time the melting point of the composite insert material to the melting point of the composite insert material. It will be noted that the melting point of the composite insert material means the lowest temperature among melting points of an oxide, metal and eutectic mixture thereof which constitute the insert material. Alternatively, the HIP treatment may be carried out under conditions of such temperature and time as indicated above where a gas such as Ar is loaded under pressure. The reason why the temperature used is over 1 3 time the melting point of the insert material is due to the fact that at lower temperatures, the bonding reaction between the composite insert material and the ceramic proceeds only very slowly with a need of a long operation time, thus being unfavorable from the industrial point of view. On the other hand, the upper limit of the temperature is determined to be lower than the melting point of the composite insert material because higher temperatures result in melting and flowing out of the insert material. The reason why the treating time is over 5 minutes is owing to the fact that when the time is less than 5 minutes, bonding between the composite insert material and the ceramic becomes insufficient. In the diffusion welding in step C, the composite insert material 3 and the metal 2 being bonded are facing each other and bonded together in vacuo or in an inert gas atmosphere under heating and pressing conditions. The bonding temperature should be below a melting point of whichever the composite insert material or the metal whose melting point is lower. The lower limit of the temperature should be over a recrystallization temperature of whichever the metal component in the composite insert material or the metal being bonded whose melting point is lower. The pressure used should preferably be 5 kg mm² and the bonding time should preferably be within 5 hours. The reason why the upper limit of the pressure is 5 kg mm² is as follows a load of higher pressures is apt to cause biased pressure because of the one dimensional pressing operation, leading to the tendency toward cracking of the brittle ceramic. The bonding time is within 5 hours, within which the bonding is ordinarily accomplished, so that longer times are not advantageous from the industrial standpoint including economy. With regard to the brazing material 4 used in step D, a brazing material whose melting point is lower than the insert material 3 is used to solder the insert material and the metal 2 therewith. The reason why brazing materials of low melting point are used is that thermal stress produced during the soldering operation due to the difference in thermal expansion coefficient between the ceramic 1 and the metal 2 is reduced so as to prevent cracking of the ceramic. As described above, the content of the metal component in the composite insert material is defined to be not less than 5 wt . This is because when the content is less, the ability of bonding with the metal lowers and the ductility of the insert material itself is lost, so that the insert material is liable to crack. On the other hand, when the content of an oxide is less than 1 wt , the ability of bonding with ceramics deteriorates, so that the upper limit of metals is 99 wt . When the ceramic 1 and the bonding metal 2 have a great difference in thermal expansion coefficient, it is possible to prevent occurrence of cracks by bonding, to the metal 2, an Fe Ni alloy or Fe Ni Co alloy having a thermal expansion coefficient close to the coefficient of the ceramic by diffusion welding or explosive welding thereby to reduce thermal stress as will be produced in the ceramic 1. In the step D, when Cu brazing 4 is effected while using steel, stainless steel as the bonding metal and Fe Ni alloy or Fe Ni Co alloy as an intermediate insertion material, these metals are liable to suffer brass cracking, so that this defect may be prevent by plating the metals with Ni or coating the metals with Ni by diffusion or explosive welding. The effects, advantages and features of the method of the invention are described below. In the practice of the invention, when the ceramic 1 and the bonding metal 2 which have a great difference in thermal expansion coefficient are used, the bonding metal 2 has been previously bonded on the surface thereof with Fe Ni alloy, Fe Ni Co alloy or Fe Cr alloy which has a thermal expansion coefficient close to the coefficient of the ceramic 1. This will reduce the thermal stress produced in the ceramic 1 and is thus very effective in preventing occurrence of the cracks. As described before, the method of the invention makes use of composite insert materials of oxides metals, The insert material is deposited by ion plating or spray coating on an oxide ceramic on the surface to which a metal is bonded and the deposited material is strongly adhered by the thermal reaction promoting treatment. Finally, the insert material and the bonding metal is completely bonded together by diffusion welding or brazing. According to the method of the invention, not only flat lap joint welding between ceramics and metals, but also sleeve joint welding, ceramic welding on inner and outer surface of a metal cylinder and the like complicate weldings are possible. The resulting joints have advantages of high bonding strength and no occurrence of cracks in the ceramics. The present invention is more particularly described by way of examples.
