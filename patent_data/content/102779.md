# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR DETECTING KNOCK IN A SPARK IGNITION ENGINE

## Abstract
Transducers 16 detect local vibration of the engine and the signals therefrom can be compared using coherence or correlation functions in the region of the knock frequency to ascertain if the source of the vibrations is the same, indicating knock, or different, indicating random vibration. Two transducers spaced apart can be used, or one can measure cylinder pressure, or one sensor could be used, using two signals delayed with respect to each other in time.
