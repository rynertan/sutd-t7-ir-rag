# Solar cell and process for producing it.

## Abstract
Surface recombination in solar cells that is produced by energy band bending at the surface 2 of the semiconductor 5 which is in turn caused by defect states which pin the Fermi level at the surface, can be improved by applying a surface layer 9 which may be a plasma oxide that has been hydrogen annealed. This layer can also have antireflecting properties.
