# Water in oil emulsions.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to water in oil emulsion spreads of the print margarine type containing a hard fat component obtained by random interesterification of sub stantially saturated triglycerides rich in laurics. Such a hard fat component imparts to the emulsions a consistency which is higher than could be expected on the ground of their solid fat content and enables the incorporation of a relatively large amount of liquid oils of the polyunsaturated type in said print margarines.
