# DISPLAY SYSTEM FOR A MEASURING INSTRUMENT

## Abstract
In a display system which displays measured results from a measuring instrument and auxiliary images on a scanning type display 109 , by reading out a graphic memory 106 in synchronism with the scanning of the display, an address sig nal is generated in synchronism with the scanning of the dis play and the graphic memory is read out by the address signal. The graphic memory has stored therein, for each word, picture element data of plural picture elements, one bit brightness control data and one bit resolution control data. The picture element data read out of the graphic memory is converted into serial picture element data for each plural picture elements. The serial picture element data is applied to a resolution con trol circuit, from which it is output during scanning of one field in interlaced scanning of the display, and during scanning of the other field, the delivery of the serial picture element data from the resolution control circuit 201 is allowed or inhibited in accordance with the resolution control data. The output serial picture element data from the resolution control circuit and the brightness control data are provided to a brightness modulator 204 , from which a signal of a level corresponding to the both data is applied as a display signal to the display.
