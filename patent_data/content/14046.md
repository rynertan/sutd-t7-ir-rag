# A method for playback of a thermal recording element.

## Abstract
In accordance with the present invention, the optical characteristics of a thermal deformation recording element are so altered that the element can be read back using the same beam as was used for recording. The read beam can be used for playback at an arbitrarily high power level to enhance the signal to noise ratio of the recovered signal and yet not damage the deformation recording. A suitable thermal recording element, therefor, contains a layer of thermal recording material comprising a binder and a dye whose spectral absorption characteristics have been alter ed for playback after a deformation pattern has been re corded therein by absorption of energy from the recording beam.
