# Amorphous antipilferage marker and detection system comprising same.

## Abstract
A magnetic theft detection system marker is adapted to generate magnetic fields at frequencies that 1 are har monically related to an incident magnetic field applied within an interrogation zone and 2 have selected tones that provide the marker with signal identity. The marker is an elongated, ductile strip of amorphous ferromagnetic ma terial that retains its signal identity after being flexed or bent.
