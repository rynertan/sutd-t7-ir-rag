## Description
The present invention relates to devices for holding or clamping cutting implements in a fixed position in accordance with the precharacterizing portions of claims 1 and 3, see US A 1 532 328. The device of the invention eliminates the need for an additional mechanical apparatus, e.g. a key, to tighten the clamping device about the cutting implement. Rotational cutting implements, e.g. drill bits, must be held firmly, e.g. clamped, in place to achieve proper cutting. This clamping is necessary because cutting causes an associated torque on the bit. Drill chucks are designed to lock the drill bit in place by creating sufficient frictional force between the engaging members and the bit shaft so that this torque does not produce rotation of the bit. In conventional drill chucks, one cannot lock cutting implements in place completely by hand tightening so a further mechanical aid, such as a key, is required to tighten the chuck. This mechanical aid supplies an additional mechanical advantage which allows the user to supply more torque. Most drill chucks and other devices for holding cutting implements in place use a three member clamp or pinching system. Normally, there are three engaging members, each of which has a set of threads on its exterior surface. This threaded screw forms part of a threaded clamping device when mated with an additional set of threads on the interior surface of an encircling yoke. The yoke has a coarsely pitched thread, matching the thread on the engaging members, on the interior surface so turning the outer portion of the drill chuck cause the yoke to turn, thereby raising the engaging members inwardly toward the bit shaft. A key is then used to further tighten or clamp the engaging members which locks the bit in place. The key acts on the lever principle and supplies the mechanical advantage necessary for clamping the bit by the chuck. This holds the bit in place without loosening as torsional forces are created during drilling. Without the key, the necessary degree of tightness is not possible in conventional chucks. However, these keys are often lost, leaving the user no method of tightening the drill chuck. To prevent loss, keys are often attached to the cord of the drill, a procedure which is potentially hazardous. A further hazardous condition may result if the drill is activated before the key is removed from the chuck. Some hand tightenable drill chucks are presently available, e.g. a chuck manufactured by Albrecht of West Germany. These drill chucks use a somewhat finer thread having a higher mechanical advantage than conventional drill chucks but work substantially on the same principle a single thread drives the clamping members against the bit. To achieve the necessary degree of tightness, the parts of the chuck are finely machined so that the chucks become prohibitively expensive for home or light industry use. In fact, these finely machined chucks can cost twice the cost of a total conventional drill. Hexagonal shank drill bits require a lesser degree of tightening than conventional cylindrical bits because of their shape but lack accuracy in drilling and can wobble loose in use. There are also minidrill chucks used for small instruments such as dental drill bits which are entirely hand tightenable but these chucks also use a conventional single thread system. These mini chucks work because they do not require the high degree of tightness in operation. Another way of achieving sufficient tightness on a drill bit without using a key is the use of a collet. However, one must change the collet for each different diameter drill shaft that is, each collet is limited to use with a single size drill shaft. Therefore, use of collets are labour intensive and time consuming. US A 1532328 describes a precision chuck provided with engaging members adapted to be clamped about the shank of a tool and having actuating means in the form of a first threaded screw means whereby the engaging members may be easily and rapidly advanced with loose pinching engagement with the tool. Supplementary means of high mechanical advantage comprising two pairs of threaded screw means are additionally provided to enable hand tightening of the chuck to clamp the engaging members about the tool shank. The supplementary means comprises a single rotatable member having an internal surface and one screw thread of each of said two pairs of threaded screw means on its internal surface. The two pairs of threaded screw means are of different pitch, whereby, each rotation of the single rotatable member advances the engaging members by their difference in pitch whereby the high mechanical advantage of the supplementary hand tightening means is achieved. The object of the invention is to provide a non precision device for holding a cutting implement in position, e.g. a drill chuck, which is hand tightenable without use of any additional mechanical devices while being compact and easy to use. According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided an apparatus for holding a cutting implement in a fixed position relative to a drive means, said apparatus including The drive means may be a motor. The apparatus provides two tightening stages rather than the conventional single stage a first tightening stage provides a rough tightening or pinching of the cutting implement while the second tightening stage provides a clamping or final tightening. These two stages work in concert to clamp the cutting implement in place. The apparatus may also include a head member having a plurality of channels therethrough. Each of the channels may be adapted to permit passage of one of the engaging members so that upon tightening of the apparatus, the engaging members slide inwardly up the channels and engage the cutting implement. The head member may also include a first set of interlocking members located on the outer edge adjacent to the yoke while the yoke may include a second set of interlocking members adapted to engage the first set of interlocking members when the apparatus is undergoing the second clamping stage to its clamped, fully tightened position. The interlocking members may be constructed and located such that the first threaded screw system cannot operate upon loosening of the apparatus until the second threaded screw system is fully loosened. In use of the apparatus, a bit or other cutting implement is placed between the plurality of engaging members and the engaging members are tightened about the bit by turning the enclosing member. Upon turning the enclosing member, the first and second set of substantially coarse threads form a first tightening system which moves the engaging members until a coarse tightening or pinching of the bit is achieved. The chuck is constructed so that the frictional force encountered in turning the fine threads is greater than the frictional force on the coarse threads until this pinching occurs. Therefore, the coarse threads turn first in the free or disengaged state. Once pinching is achieved, the coarse thread is no longer operative to tighten the engaging members about the bit due to the sudden increase in necessary tightening force once the bit shaft is engaged by the engaging members. The changeover from the coarse thread turning to turning of the fine thread occurs when the torque necessary to tighten the coarse threads becomes higher than necessary to turn the fine threads. At this stage, the fine threads turn since a lower force is required. The chuck is then clamped about the drill shaft by the action of the fine thread. This fine thread pushes the yoke upward which forces the engaging members upward thus causing further surface contact and additional friction with the bit. The upward movement of the yoke in response to the action of the fine thread causes a slight disengagement of the coarse thread. The added force and friction caused by the final inward motion of the engaging members while sliding up the channels locks the engaging members about the bit. According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided an apparatus for holding a cutting implement in a fixed position relative to a drive means, said apparatus including a clamping means comprising engaging members adapted to engage said cutting implement and hold it in a fixed position upon tightening of said clamping means, a first tightening means which pinches said engaging members about said cutting implement, and a second tightening means which then clamps said engaging members about said cutting implement, said first tightening means providing a low mechanical advantage and said second tightening means providing a relatively high mechanical advantage, said apparatus being thereby adapted to be tightened by hand without need of an additional mechanical device, wherein said first tightening means comprises first threaded screw means, said second tightening means comprises a second threaded screw means, said engaging members each having a first surface adapted to engage said cutting implement upon pinching of said clamping member and a second surface having a first set of substantially coarse threads thereon, a yoke having an interior and an exterior surface, said yoke having a second set of substantially coarse threads located on its interior surface, a screw threaded member having an exterior surface and a first set of substantially fine threads located on its exterior surface, an enclosing member exterior to said first and second tightening means and having interior and exterior surfaces, said enclosing member having a second set of subtantially fine threads on its interior surface, said first and second sets of coarse threads intermeshing to form said first threaded screw means and said second threaded screw means comprising said first and second sets of substantially fine threads, said first and second sets of substantially fine threads screw threadably intermeshing with one another, said enclosing member having two ends, a first end positioned adjacent to said yoke and a second end positioned away from said yoke, said enclosing member having said second set of substantially fine threads at said second end, said screw threaded member having an exterior surface constituting a central body including a plurality of channels for passage of said engaging members, said central body including said second fine thread located to engage said first fine thread said first end of said enclosing member abutting said yoke, and said central body, said enclosing member and said yoke constituting said second tightening means characterized in that said second tightening means comprises one pair of screw threadably intermeshing screw threads solely, and in that said first and second sets of substantially coarse threads are loose fitting with respect to one another so as to partially disengage and jam upon tightening of said clamping means. A drill chuck for holding a drill bit and constructed in accordance with this aspect of the present invention is a double screw system each of which is engaged separately by turning the yoke or an enclosing member. The yoke is turned which drives the first threaded screw system and, thereby, the engaging members to the pinching position. The enclosing member is turned to provide the clamping of the engaging members about the drill bit by forcing the yoke upward, forcing the engaging members upward and inward towards the shaft of the drill bit. The dual threaded screw system of this invention permits hand tightenability of the apparatus which may be a drill chuck. The first screw system always forms a coarse tightening by turning the yoke. The second screw system forces the yoke upward resulting in an upward and inward action of the engaging members clamping the cutting implement in place. This upward and inward action lifts the yoke thereby partially disengaging the threads of the first system. The force caused by the upward and inward action of the engaging members causes additional surface contact with the cutting implement shaft, forming a stronger hold on the shaft by the apparatus, creating the final clamping action. Some ways of carrying out the present invention will now be described by way of example, and not by way of limitation, with reference to drawings which show two specific embodiments. In the drawings The present invention features an apparatus and method for holding a cutting implement in a fixed position relative to a drive. The apparatus and method of the invention permit the locking of a cutting implement in place by hand without the need for an additional mechanical device such as a key. Conventional home and light industry drills require a lever like key for tightening the chuck about the drill bit. These keys can be lost or misplaced which makes the drill as a whole useless. A safety hazard can arise if the key is not taken out of the chuck before operation of the drill. The key can be thrown, injuring the drill user or bystanders. The present invention eliminates these problems. Turning to the figures, Figure 1 illustrates a drill chuck of the present invention. The drill chuck has a main body portion 10, a head 14, a two piece yoke 20, three engaging members 30, and enclosing can 40. The chuck also has an intermediate plate 50. In operation, engaging members 30 are positioned through channels 18 in head 14 and yoke 20 encloses engaging members 30 so that first coarse thread 32 on engaging member 30 intermeshes with second coarse thread 22 on yoke 20 to form a first threaded screw system. Yoke 20 is supported, in part, by shoulder ridge 12 which is part of body 10. Yoke 20 is surrounded by can or enclosing member 40. First fine thread 24, which is located on the exterior surface of yoke 20, intermeshes with second fine thread 44, located on the interior surface of can 40 to form a second threaded screw system. Yoke 20 includes a first set of interlocking members 26 on its surface closest to head 14 and head 14 has a second set of interlocking members 16 on its surface closest to yoke 20. The operation of the drill chuck and the efficacy of the device are better explained by turning to Figures 2 and 3. A cutting implement such as a drill bit with a shaft 100 is placed between engaging members 30 when the drill chuck is in a loosened position. Can 40 of the drill chuck is turned so that engaging members 30 are driven up passages 18 to engage shaft 100. More particularly, coarse threads 22 on yoke 20 are pitched so that upon turning can 40 and, consequently, yoke 20, engaging members 30 ride up the threaded system and are directed inward towards shaft 100. Engaging surfaces 35 of engaging members 30 then contact shaft 100 of the drill bit. This contact, which holds the bit in place, is the pinching or loose tightening of the chuck. At the pinching stage, the frictional forces and the low mechanical advantage of coarse threads 22 and 32 make it difficult to further tighten the drill chuck by hand without using the greater mechanical advantage of fine threads 24 and 44. Figure 2 illustrates a drill chuck in this pinching configuration. Figure 3 illustrates the drill chuck of Figure 2 in the locked, clamped position. Upon restricted turning of coarse threads 22 and 32, the fine thread mechanism, formed of fine threads 24 and 44, takes effect because of the inherent greater mechanical advantage of the fine thread system relative to the coarse threaded system. The action of the fine thread system pushes yoke 20 and engaging members 30 upward and inward toward shaft 100, providing more and tighter surface contact and, consequently, more friction between engaging members 30 and shaft 100. This locks engaging members 30 about shaft 100. When yoke 20 is pushed upward by the action of the fine thread mechanism, the first set of interlocking members 26 on yoke 20 engage second set of interlocking members 16 on head 14. In the interlocked position, yoke 20 and head 14 cannot turn relative to one another To loosen the drill chuck after use so as to release or change the drill bit, can 40 is turned in the opposite direction which activates the fine thread mechanism 24 and 44, thereby allowing yoke 20 to be lowered from head 14. Interlocking members 16 and 26 are constructed such that fine threads 24 and 44 must be unscrewed, releasing the engagement of interlocking members 16 and 26, before the coarse thread mechanism 22 and 32 can operate. If interlocking members 16 and 26 were missing from this configuration, coarse threads 22 and 32 could turn prior to loosening of fine threads 24 and 44. Without interlocking members 16 and 26, fine threads 24 and 44 would be in the locked position at all times after several uses and the fine thread mechanism could not assist in clamping shaft 100 in place. The purpose of intermediate plate 50 is to form a base against which can 40 bears against while pushing yoke 20 upward into the locked position. Figure 4 shows the external configuration of the chuck of Figures 1 to 3. This figure illustrates a mode of the invention, having three engaging members 30. Figure 5 illustrates an alternate configuration of the drill chuck shown in Figures 1 to 4. In this embodiment, the shaft 100 of a drill bit is placed between engaging surfaces 35 of engaging members 30 . Engaging members 30 have a first set of coarse threads 32 on second surface 38 , opposite engaging surface 35 . Yoke 20 has a second set of coarse threads 22 on its surface closest to engaging members 30 . First and second sets of coarse threads 22 and 32 engage to form the first threaded screw system. The drill chuck also has a central body 60 which includes a plurality of channels allowing passage of the engaging members 30 therethrough. Central body 60 is enclosed, in part, by an enclosing member 46 . Enclosing member 46 has an upper end 70 which abuts yoke 20 . There is a first set of fine threads 44 at the opposite end 72 of enclosing member 46 . A second set of fine threads 64 is located on central body 60 so that first and second sets of fine threads 64 and 44 form the second threaded screw system. In operation, shaft 100 is placed between engaging surfaces 35 of engaging members 30 and yoke 20 is turned. Turning yoke 20 drives engaging surfaces 35 upward and inward, pinching shaft 100 . When no further tightening is possible using the first threaded screw system, that is, when yoke 20 can no longer be turned by hand, enclosing member 46 is turned which engages the second threaded screw system. The upward action of the second threaded screw system causes yoke 20 to be pushed upward, clamping engaging members 30 about shaft 100 and partially disengaging first and second sets of coarse threads 22 and 32 . The use of drill chucks or other apparatus for holding cutting implements which fall within the scope of the invention are advantageous for a number of reasons. First, the same degree of tightness is achieved by hand as formally was available only through the use of an additional mechanical device such as a key. Second, because no lever is necessary for tightening, the keyhole and keyway are unnecessary enabling the use of thinner heads on the drill chuck. Thinner heads allow access of the drill into places which would not otherwise be attainable. Others skilled in the art may determine other modifications and variations of the apparatus and method disclosed herein which fall within the spirit and scope of the invention. Such other modifications and variations are included within the following claims.
