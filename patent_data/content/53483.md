# Method for manufacturing a module for a fiber optic link.

## Abstract
In a method for manufacturing a module for a fiber optic link, a plate shaped transparent circuit unit 24 is molded in advance. The circuit module 24 is transfer molded together with an optoelectronic element 30 connected to leads 28 2 . The circuit module 24 is clamped betweeen a pair of rod shaped first dies 42, 44 which have a common central axis and one of which defines an optical path of the module, in such a manner that the optoelectronic element 30 is located on a central axis of the circuit module 24 . Under this condition, the circuit module 24 is housed in a cavity defined by a pair of se cond dies 46, 48 . A light shielding molding material is inject ed into the cavity for injection molding to mold a case 20 . Af ter the case 20 is cured, the first and second dies 42, 44, 46, 48 are removed, and the hole of the case 20 formed by one of the first die 44 is closed with a cap to complete a recepta cle.
