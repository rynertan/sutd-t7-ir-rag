## Description
S COMPOSITI AND CLEANING HAIR THEREWITE The desire to develop products which simultaneously clean and condition hair has long been present. While the desire has long been present, developing such products has presented innumerable prnblems. Generally the agents which condition hair best are cationic with one or more long fatty hydrocarbon chains.Hair being negatively charged wil allow for the cat ionic portion to attach TO the hair while the long fatty chain s provide for ease of combing and hair conditioning. Cationic materials generally cannot be used with good cleaning anionic surfactants and still deliver good hair condition. This meant that other surfactants such as nonionics, amphoterics and zwi erionies were examined by workers in the field. Many of these efforts are reflected in patents issued in the conditioning shampes eres. U.S. Patent 3,849,348. Novembre 19, 1974 to Hewitt discloses conditioning shampoos containing betaine, cationic and amine oxide surfactants. U.S. Patent 3,697,452. October 0, 1972 to Olson et a discloses shampoo compositions similar to those in Hewitt. Another patent to Hewitt is U.S. Patent 3,755,559, August 28. .1c73 disclosing shampoos containing a tertiary amine oxide, a hicker alkyl betaine and a soap. U.S. Patent 3,822,312, July 2, 1974 To Sato discloses shampoos containing a quaternary ammonium salt, 2 betaine and an additional additive. U.S. Patent 3,990 991, november 9, 1961 to Gerstein discloses shampoos containing amphoteric surfactants and quaternary ammoniur.compounds. U.S. Patent 4,080,310 arch 21, 1978 to Ng et al discloses shampoos containing an amphoteric surfactant and a cation resin. U.S. Patent 4,132,679. January 2. 1979 to Tsutsumi et al discloses shampoos containing a phosphoric acid ester salt and a betaine. U.S. Patent 4,231,903. November 4, 1980 to Lindemann et al discloses shampoos containing a mixture of an amido betaine and a phosphobetaine. U.S. Patent 4,247,538. January 27. 1980 to Barker discloses a conditioning shampoo containing a betaine, a polypropoxylated quaternary ammonium chloride surfactant and gum arabic. U.S.Patent 4,294,728, October 13, 1981 to Vanlerberghe et al discloses shampoos containing a cationic, amphoteric or zwitterionic surfactant and a diol. U.S. Patent 4,329,335, May 11, 1981 to Su et al discloses a shampoo composition containing a betaine, an amine oxide and a polymerized quaternary compound. U.S.Patent 4,181,634, January 1, 1980 to Kennedy et al discloses shampoos containing a betaine and a bisquaternary compound. While the above described references disclose compositions containing components of the type used in the present compositions, they do not teach or suggest totally satisfactory answers to the questions of good cleaning and conditioning. It is believed that good cleaning with quaternary compounds is in part dependent on limiting the reacting of the quaternary with the fatty acids in sebum. In addition the references fail to teach or suggest combining quaternary compounds of the type disclosed herein with particular betaine surfactants. It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide hair conditioning shampoo compositions which provide good cleaning and conditioning. The good cleaning relates to improved sebum emulsification as well as good lather. It is a further object of the present invention to provide shampoo compositions containing particular quaternary ammonium compounds and betaine surfactants. These and other objects will become more apparent from the detailed description which follows. Unless otherwise indicated, all percentages and ratios herein are by weight. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION The compositions of the present invention comprise from about 0.50 to about 10. do of selected quaternary ammonium compounds, from about 5 to 70 of an amido betaine and from about 20 to about 94.5 water. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The essential as well as optional components of the present compositions are described in detail below.Quaternary Ammonium Compound The quaternary ammonium compound useful in the present compositions is selected from the group consisting of compounds having the structural formulae EMI3.1 wherein R1 an aliphatic alkyl group containing an average of from about 16 to 22 carbon atoms, most preferably from about 16 to about 18 carbon atoms, the R2 groups are C1 to C4 alkyl or hydroxyalkyl groups, the R3 groups are alkylene oxide groups, preferably propylene oxide, where y is 1 4 and X is any compatible anion, particularly one selected from the group consisting of halide, hydroxide, methylsulfate, or acetate anions.Mixtures of these agents are also useful in the present invention.The R1 groups may contain heteroatoms or other linkages, such as hydroxy groups and ester, amide or ether linkages as long as the groups fall within the required carbon atom range.

Example V To determine the abiiity of amido betainelquaternary ammonium compound compositions to emulsify sebum, the following study was conducted. Two aqueous solutions were prepared containing 18 cocamidopropyl betaine. To one solution was added 4 cetrimonium chloride and to the other was added 4 stearalkonium chloride. These solutions were diluted with distitled water to 118 of their original concentration. An aliquot of 125 grams of each diluted composition was placed at 1000F for at least two hours. A sample of each diluted composition was also placed at 1000C until constant weight was obtained. Artificial sebum, formuiated to closely match real sebum, was heated to 1000F and kept at that temperature. This heated sebum in an amount of 5 grams was added as a top layer to each of the 125 grams aliquots which were in separatory funnels. The separatory funnels were then mounted on a platform capable of rotating at 60 rpm. The funnels were rotated for 960 revolutions after which time the solutions were allowed to settle for 2 1 2 minutes. A 30 g. sample of each solution was placed at 1000C. until constant weight was obtained. The net change in mass per gram of betaine surfactant was determined. For the composition of this invention Fraction of solids in initial dilution solids content found weight of sample 0.48 0.0307 15.65 Fraction of solids which is the betaine surfactant wt. of betaine solution fraction betaine wt. of the betaine solution fraction betaine fraction salt impurity wt. of quaternary solution fraction quaternary 600 0.3096 0.7321 600 0.3096 0.0466 160.1 0.25 Fraction of solids in final composition solids content found 1.63 .0591 f weight of sample 27.59 Net change in mass upon agitation Z weight of aliquot W 6 f wt. of aliquot 6 6 f W 0.0307 0.0591 124.92 3.7716 f 1 0.0591 1 Net change in mass per gram of betaine surfactant y y 6 3.7716 1.34 ZWZ 0.0307 124.92 .7321 A similar calculation for the stearalkonium chloride composition showed that there was only 0.08 grams of change in mass per gram of betaine surfactant.
