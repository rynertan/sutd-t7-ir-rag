# Engine knock control apparatus.

## Abstract
The invention refers to an engine knock control appar atus including a knock sensor 100 detecting engine knock ing and producing a knock signal as output and an amplifier amplifying the knock signal and is characterized by a knock signal clamping circuit 116A coupled to the knock sensor 100 and clamping the output signal of the knock sensor 100 at a predetermined maximum level and preventing an abnormal rise of its signal voltage, an integrator 117 receiving the output signal from the clamping circuit 116A and providing an integrated output signal and a comparator 118 receiving and comparing the integrated output signal and the knock signal which provides a spark timing control signal to an ignition control device 103 controlling the ignition timing of an ignition coil 135 .
