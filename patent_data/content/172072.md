# Solder connector device.

## Abstract
This invention relates to heat shrinkable devices for forming solder connections between two bodies such as electrical conductors 1 or pipes. The devices each comprise a hollow, heat shrinkable sleeve 3 having at least one aperture and containing first and second solder inserts 7,9 . The solder inserts 7,9 are located adjacent to eachother and the second insert 9 responds to heat applied to the device more slowly than the first insert 7 . Usually the second insert 9 has a higher melting point than the first insert 7 . When the device is installed the first solder insert 7 melts but is prevented from flowing out of the aperture in the device by the second insert. Also flow of the fused first solder insert 7 onto the second solder insert 9 causes the second insert 9 to melt with less heat being applied to the device than would be needed if only the second, higher melting point solder insert 9 were present in the device.
