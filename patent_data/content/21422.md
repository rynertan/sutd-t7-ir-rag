# Gas separating member.

## Abstract
A gas separating member of the present invention comprises a porous substrate 5 in the form of a film, wall or hollow fiber and a polymer film formed on a surface of the substrate by plasma polymerization. The gas separation factor O₂ N₂ ranges from 2.3 to 3.9 with the corresponding gas permeability ranging from 12 to 0.16 liters min. m² atm. pres. air. A modified gas separating member of the present invention, which comprises a porous substrate 5 in the aforementioned form and two polymer films formed on a surface of the substrate by plasma polymerization, has the gas separation factor He N₂ ranging from 14 45.
