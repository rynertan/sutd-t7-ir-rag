## Description
Door for the rear wall of a motor vehicle The present invention relates to doors for the rear walls of motor vehicle bodies. The door according to the invention is characterised in that it comprises a frame of plastics material having an upper cross member, a lower cross member, and a pair of pillars which interconnect the cross members so as to define an aperture for the fitting of a rear window, the cross members. and the pillars being integral with each other and having, on the surface intended to face inwardly of the vehicle, a shaped stiffening rib extending continuously around the perimeter of the aperture for cooperation with the remaining part of the rear wall of the motor vehicle body when the door is in the closed position, to ensure sealing of the rear wall itself, and a pair of arms fixed to the frame for hinging the door to the body about an axis adjacent the upper cross member of the frame itself. By virtue of this characteristic, a door for the rear wall of a motor vehicle is formed which has considerable strength, lightness and compactness, and is particularly easy and efficient to assemble and use. Further characteristics and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following description, given purely by way of non limiting example. with reference to the appended drawings, in which Figure 1 is a side perspective view from above of a door according to the invention, Figure 2 is a section taken on the line II II of Figure 1, in which, to facilitate the comprehension of the function of several parts of the invention, the invention is shown in its assembled position on the rear wall of a motor vehicle, illustrated schematically in broken outline, and Figure 3 is an exploded perspective view of the door according to the invention from a point of view approximately opposite the point of view of Figure 1. In the drawings, a door hatch , generally indicated 1, is intended for connection to the rear part of the body of a motor vehicle not illustrated . The door 1 has a frame 2 constituted by a single element shell moulded from plastics material and having an approximately trapezoidal shape. The frame 2 comprises an upper cross member 3 and a lower cross.member 4 connected together by a pair of pillars 5, 6. The cross members 3, 4 and the pillars 5, 6 define an aperture 7 within which is fitted a rear window 9 with the interposition of a weather strip 8. Around the periphery of the aperture 7, the cross members 3, 4 and the pillars 5, 6 have a thickened profiled edge 10 so as to facilitate the fitting of the strip 8 and the window 9 and to ensure the firm connection of the window 9 itself within the frame 4 after assembly. On their surfaces intended to face inwardly of the motor vehicle, the cross members 3, 4 and the pillars 5, 6, which are channel shaped, have a profiled rib 11 which extends continuously around the perimeter of the aperture 7, that is to say, around the entire perimeter of the frame 2. The arrangement is such that, when the door 1 is closed, the profiled rib 11 compresses a tubular rubber weather strip A illustrated in broken outline in Figure 2 fitted in known manner to the edge of the aperture in the rear wall W of the body of the motor vehicle to which the door 1 is fitted. The profiled rib 11 thus cooperates with the rear wall in order to ensure its sealing against atmospheric agents. The connection of the door 1 to the bodyworkW is achieved by means of a pair of L shaped arms 12, each of which has a portion fixed to the frame 2 in correspondence with one of the pillars 5, 6 and a portion which projects approximately perpendicular to the general plane of the door 1. The projecting portion has an eyelet 13 at its free end for receiving a pin for connection to the bodywork W. Thus, the arrangement described is such as to allow the door 1 to be turned about a horizontal axis adjacent the upper cross member 3 of the frame 2. In order considerably to strengthen the hinge system, the arms 12 are made of metal and are connected to the frame 2 by bolts 14 for which corresponding screw holes 15 are provided in the pillars 5, 6. Each of the pillars 5, 6 is also provided with an apertured part 16 acting as an attachment element for one of the ends of a telescopic damping member air spring 17 intended to make the opening and closing movements of the door 1 more gradual. Preferably, the apertures 15 and the apertured parts 16 are outside the profiled rib 11 whereby the sealing effect achieved by this rib, which has two longitudinal grooves 18 for making the compressive action on the weather strip A more effective, is not reduced by the presence in the rib 11 itself of apertures for the passage of the arms 12 and possibly the damping members 17. Transverse the rib 11, within the cross members 3, 4 and the pillars 5, 6 which, as mentioned above, have a general channel shape, there extend partitions 19 constituting further stiffening ribs for the frame 2. A lock, indicated 20, is fixed to the lower cross member 4 in correspondence with a recess 21 in the bottom of which is an aperture through which the keyhole 20A of the lock is accessible from outside the vehicle. A motor geared motor , indicated 22, controls the operation of a windscreen wiper blade 23 which can move across outer surface of window 9. The geared motor 22 is bolted to the lower cross member 4 of the frame 2 in correspondence with an aperture 24 through which extends the shaft of the motor 22 carrying the arm of the wiper blade 23. A further aperture 25 above the aperture 24 constitutes a seat for the mounting of a nozzle 26 for spraying a detergent solution onto the outer surface of the window 9. A dish shaped element of plastics material, indicated 27, is screwed to the lower cross member 4 of the frame 2 and forms a housing for the motor 22 which drives the windscreen wiper blade 23. The motor 22 is thus protected against bumps and the action of environmental agents. The dish shaped element 27, the fitting of which further strengthens the lower part of the frame 2, is provided underneath with two apertures 26, 29. The aperture 28 constitutes an assembly seat for a connector 30 associated with the electrical sup ply circuit for the motor 22 which operates the window wiper blade 23. The aperture 29 houses a connector 31 connected in the circuit for supplying the detergent solution to the nozzle 26. The arrangement is such that both the connectors 30, 31 are easily accessible from outside the element 27 to allow the connection of the motor 22 to the electrical system of the motor vehicle and the connection of the nozzle 26 to a pump member not shown for the detergent solution, respectively.
