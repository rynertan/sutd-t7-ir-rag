# RIA for hepatitis A antigen and antigen antibody radionuclide therefor.

## Abstract
Liquid containing hepatitis A antibody is adsorbed on a surface. The surface is then coated with a proteinaceous material and incubated in the presence of the sample to form a complex of hepatitis A antigen and hepatitis A antibody. The complex is incubated again in the presence of excess radio actively labelled hepatitis A antibody, and the resulting radionuclide is measured.
