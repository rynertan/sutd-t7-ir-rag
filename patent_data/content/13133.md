# Process for separation of alkylphenols by azeotropic distillation.

## Abstract
In the separation of at least two alkyl phenols having close boiling points by azeotropic distillation of a mixture composed of the alkyl phenols with a hydrocarbon azeotrop ing agent, the use, as hydrocarbon azeotroping agent, of satu rated aliphatic hydrocarbons of 9 to 13 carbon atoms having a boiling point of 150 to 190 C at 760 mmHg provides an improved separating efficiency.
