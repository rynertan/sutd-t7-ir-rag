# A wire cut electric discharge machine and a power source for such a machine.

## Abstract
The power source has a transistor capacitor discharge circuit with a power supply V₂, a resistor R, a control transistor Tr and a plurality of capacitors C₁, C₂, C₃ each connectable in parallel with wire electrode WIR and work piece WK. Inductors L₁ and L₂ are provided in series with capacitors C₁ and C₂. A stray inductance is effective in series with capacitor C₃. Switches S₁ to S₃ switch in the capacitors C₁ to C₃ selectively. The capacitors increase in value from C₁ to C₃, and the inductances L₁ L₂ and the stray inductance correspondingly decrease in value. Eache capacitance value is appropriate to a different machining operation, i.e. C₃ for rough machining, C₂ for medium machining and C₁ for finish machining. By the use of different capacitors, and corresponding inductances, cutting speed can be maintained in each diffe rent machining operation.
