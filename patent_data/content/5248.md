## Description
This invention relates to new tetrapeptide hydrazide derivatives which have analgesic activity. Hushes et al isolated from the brain of a pig a couple of pentapeptides, generically called enkephalin, which give morphinomimetic activity on intracerebral administration, and identified them to be H Tyr Gly Gly Phe Met OH and HTyr Gly Gly Phe Leu OH, respectively Nature 258, 577 P 1975 . Although these substances display a morphinemimetic action when directly administered by the intracerebral route, they do not have an analgesic action on intravenous administration. R Endorphin, which is apparently derived from the carboxyl terminal of lipotropin, when intravenously administered produces profound analgesic effects but since it is a polypeptide consisting of 31 amino acid residues, it is extremely difficult to produce it by an organic chemical process and, therefore, to make it available as a medicinal product on a commercial scale. The investigation made for commercially advantageous compounds which would be stable and capable of producing an adequate relief of pain on intravenous or subcutaneous administration led us to the finding that certain tetrapeptide derivatives are suitable for the abovestated purpose.The finding was followed by further research which has resulted in this present invention This invention is directed to 1 a tetrapeptide hydrazide derivative, inclusive of a pharmacologically acceptable acid addition salt thereof, which has the general formula I EMI2.1 wherein 21 is hydrogen or lower alkyl R2 is hydrogen or the side chain of a r a amino acid R3 is hydrogen or lower alkyl R4 is hydrogen, or a saturated or unsaturated and straight or branched lower aliphatic acyl group which may optionally. be substituted by hydroxy, amino, lower alkoxy, halogen, oxo, lower alkylthio or lower alkylthiooxide7 2 a method of producing a tetrapeptide hydrazide derivative of general formula I characterized by deprotecting a compound of general formula II EMI2.2 wherein R1 is hydrogen or lower alkyl R2 is hydrogen or the side chain of a D a amino acid which may optionally be protected F, is hydrogen or lower alkyl R4 is hydrogen, or a saturated or unsaturated and straight or branched lower aliphatic acyl group which may optionally be substituted by hydroxy, amino lower alkoxy halogen, oxo, lower alkylthio or lower alkylthiooxide and which may be protected Y1 is A protective group Y2 and YX, respectively mean hydrogen or a protective group .

A tetrapeptide hydrazide derivative of chemical structural formula I is produced by condensing N terminal amino acid or a peptide fragment of tetrapeptidehydraziyie I , having a N terminal amino did, with the remaining part of the tetrapeptidehydrazide T . Thus, for example, the following alternative methods may be utilized for this purpose. The methods described in M. Bodansky and M.A.Ondetti Peptide Synthesis, Interscience, New York, 1966 F.N. Finn and K. Hofman The Proteins, Vol. 2, ed. by H. Nenrath, R. L. Hill, Academic Press Inc,, New York, 1976 or Nobuo Izumiya et al Peptide Gosei Peptide Synthesis ,Maruzen Inc. , 1975, may be utilized Thus, for example, the azide method, chloride method, acid anhydride method, mixed acid anhydride method, DCC method, active ester method, the method involving the use of Woodwar l s reagentK, carbodiimidazole method, reduction oxidation method and rCC HONB method may be mentioned. There are cases in which the NCA N carboxy anhydride method the method involving the use of an intramolecular cyclic carbonyl compound corresponding to the amino acid without use of a protective group may be utilized. Prior to the condensation reaction, the carboxyl or and amino group in starting material which will not be pertinent to the reaction may be previously protected or the carboxyl or and amino groups of starting material which are pertinent to the reaction may be previously activated. The protective groups for the starting material may be the protective groups mentioned hereinbefore. The carboxyl group of the starting material may also be protected in the form of metal salt e. g. sodium salt, potassium salt , t alkylamine salt e.g. triethylamine salt, N methylmorpholine salt or ester e.g. methyl ester, ethyl ester, benzyl ester, p nitrobenzyl ester, t butyl ester, t amyl ester .As examples of the protective group for the amino group in the starting material, there may be mentioned benzyloxy carbon, t butoxycarbonyl and isobornYloxyearbonyl.

The reaction may be carried out in a solvent. This solvent is selected from among the solvents hitherto known to be suited for peptide synthesis reactions. Thus, for example, there may be mentioned anhydrous or aqueous dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, pyridine, chloroform, dioxane, dichloromethane and tetrahydrofuran as well as appropriate mixtures of such solvents The reaction temperature is selected from the range hitherto known to be suited for peptide synthesis reactions and may normally range from about 200C to about 30 C. The precursor compounds protected peptides for the compounds of this invention may be easily produced as well by the solid phase synthesis procedure The protected compound of formula II so obtained is subjected to a deprotecting reaction by which the protective groups are removed.While the deprotecting reaction depends on the type of protective group involved, it is preferred for commercial purposes that this reaction is such that it removes all the protective groups in a single step without affecting the peptide bonds. Thus, protective groups are chosen in consideration of this possibility.Table 1 shows some combinations of different types of protective groups and typical deprotecting conditions l able 1EMI11.1 tb SEP protective SEP Protective SEP Protective tb SEP group SEP group SEP on SEP group SEP on tb Conditions SEP Yl SEP Y2 SEP 1 SEP R SEP 3 tb of SEP removal SEP 2 SEP 4 tb lI2 catalyst SEP Z SEP Bzl SEP SEP SEP Z tb H2 catalyst SEP Z SEP SEP SEP SEP tb CF3COOH SEP BOO SEP But SEP But SEP But SEP BOC tb SEP 2N HCt SEP OC SEP SEP SEP SEP tb in SEP acetic SEP acid BOC SEP SEP SEP SEP BOC tb CH SEP SO SEP H SEP z SEP SEP SEP SEP BOC tb SEP 33 tb While Table 1 is a listing of some deprotecting reactions such as catalytic reduction involving the use of palladium black, palladium on carbon, platinum or the like catalyst and acid hydrolysis with trifluoroacetic acid, dilute hydrochloric acid or methanesulfonic acid, such other processes as reduction with sodium metal in liquid ammonia and acid hydrolysis with the use of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, a solution of hydrogen bromide in glacial acetic acid, hydrogen fluoride or the like may also be mentioned.
