## Description
POLYPROPYLENE FOAMED MOLDED ARTICLES AND PROCESS FOR PRODUCTION THEREOF This invention relates to a polypropylene foamed molded article and a process for its production. Foamed molded articles obtained by a method comprising filling preliminarily foamed particles in a mold having a capability of enclosing the particles and allowing escape of gases therefrom, and foaming them by heating, generally known as a bead molding method, have been utilized in a wide range of applications as cushioning materials, packaging materials, thermal insulating materials, building materials, etc.according to their inherent properties. Polystyrene foamed articles obtained by the bead molding method have generally been in commercial use as this type of molded articles. However, since they have the serious defect of being brittle and also have inferior chemical resistance, it has long been desired to improve these properties of the polystyrene foamed articles. In an attempt to remedy these defects, molded articles composed of crosslinked foamed polyethylene have been proposed. However, these polyethylene foamed articles have the defect that they cannot be obtained in low density namely, as highly expanded articles . If an attempt is made to obtain by all means a polyethylene foamed article having a low density, the resulting article has an open cellular structure and shows inferior properties typified by a high water absorption and a low rebound.Such products are not commercially feasible. On the other hand, an attempt to obtain a product having a high proportion of closed cells inevitably results in obtaining a product having a high density. It is an object of this invention therefore to provide a polypropylene foamed molded article having excellent properties which completely eliminates the defects of the aforesaid polyethylene foamed article. Another object of this invention is to provide a foamed molded article which has excellent cushioning and rebounding properties, a high mechanical strength and a reduced residual stress, and is light in weight. We have now found that if a polypropylene resin is employed as a starting material in the bead molding method, the above objects can be achieved, and a foamed molded article having a low density and yet a high proportion of closed cells can be obtained. Thus, according to this invention, there is provided a polypropylene foamed molded article having a density of from 0.011 to 0.026 g cm3 and a closed cell proportion of at least 80 , said molded article being obtained by filling preliminarily foamed particles of the polypropylene resin in mold having a capability of enclosing the particles and allowing escape of gases therefrom, and foaming them by heating. The polypropylene resin constituting the foamed molded article of this invention include polypropylene, and a polypropylene type resins exemplified by an ethylene propylene copolymer, and a mixture of an ethylene propylene copolymer with low density polyethylene and or an ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer.The polypropylene resins may be in the crosslinked or non crosslinked state, preferably in the non crosslinked state. The foamed molded article of this invention should have a density of from 0.011 to 0.026 g cm3.If its density is less than 0.011 g cm3, its mechanical strength and dimensional stability are low, and when it is used as a cushioning material, the range of suitability for cushioning becomes narrow. On the other hand, if its density exceeds 0.026 g cm3, its surface is too hard, and when it is used as a cushioning material, it has the inferior ability to protect the surface of merchandise to be protected and is likely to injure it. Moreoyer, it has poor flexibility. The preferred range of density is from 0.012 to 0.023 g cm3. The foamed molded article of this invention should have such a cellular structure that its closed cell proportion is at least 80 . If its closed cell proportion is less than 80 , it has a high water absorption and residual stress and a low rebound, and when it is used as a cushioning material, the range of suitability for cushioning is narrow. Thus, if an article having a heavy weight is placed on it, the cushioning material is compressed and the desired cushioning effect cannot be obtained. The preferred closed cell proportion is at least 90 . The closed cell proportion can be determined by making calculations in accordance with the method of W. J. Remington andR. Pariser on the basis of the specific gravity of the sample measured by an air comparing type specific gravity meter made by Toshiba Beckman. The foamed molded article of this invention can be produced, for example, by a process which comprises pressurizing preliminarily foamed particles of a polypropylene resin with an inorganic gas such as air or a mixture of an inorganic gas and a volatile blowing agent, filling the preliminarily foamed particles having an elevated pressure imparted to their inside in a mold having a capability of enclosing the particles and allowing escape of gases therefrom, and heating them, thereby expanding the particles according to the configuration of the mold and bonding the particles to each other at the fused surface of the particles. The preliminarily foamed particles can be produced, for example, by dispersing particles of the polypropylene resin and a volatile blowing agent in water in a closed vessel, heating the dispersion to a temperature above a point at which the particles soften to impregnate the blowing agent into the particles, and thereafter, opening one end of the vessel to release the particles and water simultaneously into an atmosphere kept at a lower pressure than the inside of the vessel while maintaining the pressure of the inside of the vessel at a predetermined value. As stated hereinabove, the foamed molded article of this invention has unexpected excellent properties, such as excellent cushioning and rebounding properties, a low residual stress, a high mechanical strength, a broad range of suitability for cushioning, high dimensional stability, moderate flexibility with the great ability to protect the surface of merchandise to be protected, a low water absorption, high heat resistance, excellent chemical resistance and light weight. Accordingly, it is useful in a wide range of applications as cuhioning materials, packaging materials, thermal insulating materials, building materials, etc. The following Example specifically illustrates the present invention.Example 100 Parts by weight of each of resin particles, an amount indicated in Table 1 of dichlorodifluoromethane as a volatile blowing agent, 0.5 part by weight of aluminum oxide as a dispersing agent and 300 parts by weight of water were put in a closed vessel, and with stirring, these materials were heated to a predetermined temperature indicated in Table 1 for one hour to thereby impregnate the blowing agent into the resin particles. One end of the vessel was opened, and the resin particles and water were simultaneously released into the atmosphere while maintaining the pressure of the inside of the vessel at a predetermined value. The resin particles were dried to form preliminarily foamed particles. In the above experiment, preliminarily foamed particles having various densities were obtained by using an ethylenepropylene random copolymer ethylene content 3 by weight and low dinsity polyethylene and varying the amount of dichlorodifluoromethane. Each type of the preliminarily foamed particles was pressurized with air in a pressure vessel, and filled in a mold having a capability of enclosing the particles and allowing escape of gases therefrom. The particles were then heated by steam to expand the particles according to the configuration of the mold. The closed cell proportions, densities and other properties of the resulting foamed molded articles are shown in Table 2.
