## Description
This invention relates to a cartop carrier connector for cars having flush mounted doors, that is doors having upper cappings which are set flush with the car body top, said cappings defining a bay which encloses and conceals the side gutter flush mounted doors of the general type outlined above being installed, in particular, on the Mits bishi Coltn Model cars, The invention is essentially directed to providing a connector which enables the cartop carrier to rest onto the side gutter, while allowing proper closing without interference of such a flush mounted door. Within the above general aim, it is possible to arrange that the connector of this invention is constructed to ensure a firm retention of the cartop carrier, notv ithstanding the small room available to accoritnodate the carrier securing means. According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a cartop carrier connector for flush mounted door cars, in particular cars of the type of the Colt model by litsubishi, characterized in that it comprises a plurality of uprights, each upright having a cha nel like widened foot intended for engaging the gutter, an upright body having a C like sectional profile,andan adjoining area between said foot and body which is flattened to fit through the gap between the car roof and door, the channel like foot being held against the gutter by pressure screws carried in a bracket arranged to embrace the gutter externally thereto. Further features and advantages will be more clearly apparent from the detailed description which follows, with reference to the accompanying drawings, where Figure 1 is a schematical cross section of a car having flush mounted doors as indicated, showing a connector according to the invention in its position of installation on said car Figure 2 is a longitudinal section of the connector upright and Figure 3 is a top plan view of said upright. In the drawings, the reference numeral 10 designates the car body top or roof of a car having side doors 11 of the flush mounted or wrap around 1 type, specifically of a Mitsubishi motor car of the Colt model type. As it may be seen, the flush mowated door 11 has an upper capping or molding 110 which is set flush with the roof and defines a bay 12 wherein the gutter 13 is accommodated which extends laterally along the roof base between the capping 110 and roof 10 there is left a gap 14 of small width. The numeral 20 designates generally the connector for the cartop carrier. According to the invention, it comprises a plurality of uprightoeach having a widened foot 200 with a channel like sectional profile and intended to engage in the gutter 13, a C like contoured body 201,and an area 202 adjoining said foot and body and being suitably flattened to pass without interference through the gap 14 the area 202 being provided with longitudinal stiffening ribs 203.With the foot 200 of each connector 20, there cooperates a bracket 30 of US e configuration, the lower or bottom portion 300 whereof engages the gutter 13 from below and embraces it toward the top. The upper portion 301 of the bracket has a pair of threaded holes acco ..odating corresponding pressure screws 31 which react against the channel foot to urge it in forced contact engagement with the gutter 13. Advantageously, between the bracket 30 and gutter, there is interposed a lining 40 of an elastomer material. The body 201 of each upright 20 is adapted for receiving, in sliding relationship and in an adjustable manner, the supporting leg not shown incorporated to the cartop carrier, and is provided with two or more frontally located holes 203 204 for the passage of bolts therethrough which are effective to lock the upright and sapporti3g leg in a selected adjustment position.
