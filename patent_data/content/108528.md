# Casting of metal articles.

## Abstract
A casting process is described, the process embodying the use of cores made from material comprising dicalcium silicate. Dicalcium silicate undergoes various phase changes during heating and cooling one of which, the β to γ transformation, is accompanied by a large volume increase. By using this feature casting cores may be produced which disintegrate during cooling of the solidified metal.
