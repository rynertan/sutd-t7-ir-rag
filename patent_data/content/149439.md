# PRODUCTION OF ALKYL GLYOXYLATES

## Abstract
Alkyl glyoxylates are prepared by contacting gaseous alkyl glycolate in the presence of gaseous oxygen source with unsupported metallic silver at a temperature in the range of about 325 to about 685 C. The alkyl glyoxylates are useful as intermediates for the synthesis of other products such as allantoin.
