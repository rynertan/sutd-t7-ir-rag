# A non aqueous cell comprising a cathode comprising the reaction product of Bi2O3 and WO3.

## Abstract
The invention deals with a cathode comprising the reaction product of Bi₂O₃ and WO₃. This solid cathode material comprising the thermal reaction product of bismuth trioxide and tungsten trioxide is used in electro chemical cell systems in combination with a highly active metal anode and a liquid organic electrolyte such as 3 methyl 2 oxazolidone.
