# Method and apparatus for controlling casing holdback.

## Abstract
In a casing machine, a length adjustable engaging means 18 for adjusting casing holdback force contacts about the outer surface of the casing 14 . The length of the engaging means is adjustable to position a pressure ring 42 on one end of the engaging means closer to or farther from a sizing member 16 which contacts the inner surface of the casing whereby the distance between the pressure ring 42 and sizing member 16 establishes the magnitude of the casing holdback force.
