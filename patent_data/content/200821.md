# COMBINATIONAL LOGIC STRUCTURE USING PASS TRANSISTORS

## Abstract
PASS transistors are used to reduce the layout com plexity of logic circuits by using PASS transistors connected to pass a first and second input function to an output node in response to selected Control signals, thereby to generate a selected output function on the output node. The PASS transistor comprises a transistor capable of passing an input function in response to a Control signal applied to the transistor thereby to generate an output function related to the input function. In general, the input function comprises less than all of a set of input variables and the control function comprises one or more of the remainder of the set of input variables.
