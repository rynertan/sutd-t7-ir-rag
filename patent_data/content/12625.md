# False twist spindle arrangement.

## Abstract
False twist is imparted to synthetic yarn by a cluster of three spindles 28, 30, 32 with interpenetrating discs. The yarn follows a helically zig zag path through the cluster. The discs comprise smooth, polished infeed and outfeed guide discs 42 and 44 and twist imparting discs 46 and 48 with smooth but frictional surfaces. In order to combine high twist with low breakage, the friction discs comprise thick 6 mm infeed discs 46 and thin 4 mm outfeed discs 42, 44 which provide a smaller yarn to disc angle B 61 in the outfeed zone than in the infeed zone A 68 , thereby reducing yarn tension in the outfeed zone.
