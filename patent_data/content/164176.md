## Description
This application is a continuation in part of U.S. Serial No. 617,483, filed June 5, 1984, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference into the present application. Throughout this application various publications are referenced by arabic numerals within parentheses. Full citations for these references may be found at the end of the specification immediately preceding the claims. The disclosures of these publications in their entireties are hereby incorporated by reference into this application in order to more fully describe the state of the art as known to those skilled therein as of the date of the invention described and claimed herein. The phylum Apicomplexa includes hundreds of different organisms belonging to the order Eucoccidiorida. The genus Differentiation of species is based on the site of infection within the host and oocyst morphology. To date, biochemical markers have not been used for speciation, although differences have been noted for each of the above species. For The process of parasite development is self limiting if the host ingests no additional oocysts. However, this proves to be an unrealistic expectation in crowded poultry houses. Disease due to The pathology of coccidiosis due to A consistent property of the coccidia is that the sporozoites initiate the infection process within very specific tissue sites 28, 23, 41 . The site specificity of infection is a characteristic commonly used for speciation of Much of the work on immunity to coccidiosis has been confined to humoral immunity, and more specifically to serum antibody. The studies have shown a lack of correlation between serum antibody and resistance to disease 43 . However, most available data suggest that a local response with involvement of the secretory immune system or cell mediated immunity CMI , or both, are involved in the protective response. Interference with recognition and or attachment of pathogens to host cells has a demonstrated protective effect as shown with viral, bacterial and protozoan agents. Genetic deletion of key host cell receptors or pathogen attachment features can prevent the initial colonization process 14, 40 . Alternatively, secretory antibodies can interfere with the colonization process by binding to, and consequently masking requisite host cell recognition determinants 22, 54 . All immunoglobulin classes tested to date have been reported to have the capacity of interfering with the initial colonization process of It has been estimated that an amount approaching 0.5 1.0 billion is spent annually by producers worldwide in an effort to curb the devastating effect of coccidiosis in chickens 28, 39 . Even with control measures currently in use, poultry losses are substantial with estimates in the multi million dollar range 45 . Currently, the most widely used means of controlling Protection of birds by immunization has met with some success. Investigators have been able to invoke limited protection using preparations of killed organisms 1, 30, 31 . A more effective approach for immunization of chickens has been with the use of a live protozoal product e.g. Coccivac 13 . The product, being a multivalent composition containing low doses of viable oocysts, is administered in drinking water to invoke a mild parasitemia in birds. A drawback of this product has been occasional depressed performance of birds during the first weeks following administration. Variables such as excessive dosing or moisture content of bedding have even led to severe outbreaks of coccidiosis. See also, U.S. Patent No. 3,147,186 1964 which concerns the use of viable, sporulated oocysts of An alternative means of introducing the live vaccine into broiler houses is by way of the feed. This has been considered in a recent British patent GB2,008,404A . Prior to mixing with the feed, fully virulent oocysts of Efforts have indeed been made to develop Attenuation by precocious selection has also been practiced when Subunit approaches to vaccine development have proven successful over the past few years. In such approaches, candidate protective antigens are identified and characterized for purpose of eventual preparation on a large scale. In studying parasite antigens, one research group used monoclonal antibodies to identify a potential protective antigen on the surface of Since mid 1981, Danforth and coworkers have published several papers in which they indicate the possibility of producing monoclonal antibodies toward antigens of avian Although the preparation of murine origin hybridomas producing monoclonal antibodies is known, there is nothing to suggest that the direct and specific selection of sporozoite neutralizing hybridomas will identify virulence determinants of In fact, there is no prior teaching concerning identification of antigens of This invention concerns the identification, characterization, preparation and use of polypeptide antigens for development of immunity to coccidiosis by The invention also concerns the preparation, formulation and use of a monoclonal antibody product directed against the aforementioned protective protein antigen which can be used in the purification of the antigen, as well as to confer passive protection against coccidiosis due to A purified antigenic protein, also referred to herein as the A4 protein or A4 antigen, has been obtained which is capable of inducing in a chicken an immune response conferring protection against infection by Polypeptides related to the A4 protein may be obtained which are characterized by the ability to induce in a chicken an immune response conferring protection against infection by The 25,000 molecular weight, purified protein antigen may be prepared by separately recovering it from the sporocyst of Active immunity against infection by The monoclonal antibody Ptn 7.2A4 4 or any other such antibody may be used to confer passive immunity against Figure 1 displays the amino acid sequence of the 17,000 dalton polypeptide component of the Figure 2 shows the restriction enzyme maps of the Figure 3 shows the DNA nucleotide sequence of the Bgl II Eco RI DNA fragment of the genomic clone depicted in Figure 2. In addition, Figure 3 shows the amino acid sequence for the signal peptide and the 17,000 dalton and the 8,000 dalton polypeptide components of the A4 antigen. Figure 3 also shows the introns within the gene. This invention concerns a purified antigenic protein capable of inducing in a chicken an immune response conferring protection against infection by The 25,000 dalton protein, also referred to herein as the A4 protein or A4 antigen has been obtained from sporocysts of If the A4 antigen is radiolabeled by iodination of The presence of these amino acid sequences was confirmed by elucidation of the complete amino acid sequence Figure 1, 3 . Blockage of the N terminus of the protein is also supported by the complete amino acid sequence which indicates the presence of an N terminal glutamine molecule. Such glutamine residues are known to cyclize to form pyrrolidone carboxylic acid. The A4 protein has an actual molecular weight of about 25,000 based on its complete amino acid sequence, and has an apparent molecular weight of 21,000 23,000 on SDS PAGE under non reducing conditions. After reduction with Î² mercaptoethanol two polypeptides are seen on SDS PAGE 24 . The A4 protein therefore consists of two polypeptides, a 17,000 and an 8,000 dalton peptide which are bonded to one another by disulfide linkage. The complete amino acid sequence of the 17,000 dalton peptide and a partial amino acid sequence of the 8,000 dalton peptide have been determined by microsequencing analysis. The sequences so determined are consistent with the separately determined sequence of the chromosomal DNA which encodes the protein. This invention also contemplates antigenic polypeptides which include an amino acid sequence present within the A4 protein and which are capable of inducing in a chicken an immune response conferring protection against infection by Two preparations containing two such polypeptides have been prepared. These preparations are characterized by the presence within them of polypeptides with apparent molecular weights of about 11,500 and about 6,500 respectively, on SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. These preparations have been identified immunologically as derived from the A4 antigen. Antigenic polypeptides which include an amino acid sequence present in the A4 protein may be produced by various methods, e.g., may be chemically or enzymatically synthesized, may be produced by recombinant DNA methods, may be prepared from the A4 antigen or may be prepared from the sporocyst or sporozoite of The antigens of this invention in addition to an amino acid sequence included within the amino acid sequence of the A4 protein may contain one or more other substances such as polysaccharides, e.g. dextran, or other amino acid sequences, i.e. amino acid sequences not included within the amino acid sequence set forth in Figure 3. This invention also concerns a method for preparing the A4 protein. This method involves contacting sporocysts of Alternatively, the A4 protein is separately recovered from an extract of The 17,000 dalton polypeptide of the A4 protein may be prepared by the same method used in preparing the A4 protein. The 17,000 dalton poypeptide is then separately recovered, e.g. by effecting partial purification with ion exchange chromatography, e.g. with DEAE cellulose, followed by preparative SDS electrophoresis under reducing conditions. The 11,500 dalton antigenic polypeptide may be prepared by contacting sporocysts of A method involving recombinant DNA technology is also provided for preparing the 25,000 dalton A4 protein, the 17,000 dalton polypeptide thereof or the various antigenic polypeptides of this invention. The method involves preparing a DNA molecule coding for the A4 protein or polypeptide and inserting the DNA molecule into an appropriate expression vector, e.g. a vector containing the Î»P Messenger RNA may be isolated from sporocysts at many points during the sporulation process. These mRNA samples may then be translated using Alternatively, genomic DNA from This invention also encompasses a method for conferring upon a chicken active immunity against infection by The A4 antigen or any of the antigenic polypeptides of this invention may be administered to chickens by any of a number of well known methods. Desirably, the administration may involve subcutaneous or intramuscular injection at the back of the neck. The amount of antigen comprising an effective immunizing amount may be any amount from about 0.1 microgram to about 1 mg. The amount of antigen is desirably above about 10 micrograms. The preferred amount of antigen is about 500 micrograms per kilogram of body weight. Alternatively, the administration may be oral e.g., via capsule or desirably by injection e.g., subcutaneous, intradermal, or preferably intramuscular injection . If the mode of administration involves injection, any pharmaceutically acceptable carrier may be employed. Suitable carriers include 0.01 to 0.1M, preferably 0.05M, phosphate buffer or 0.8 percent saline. A vaccine for conferring upon a chicken active immunity against infection by In addition, the carrier desirably also contains a preservative. One particularly suitable preservative is thimerosal sodium ethylmercurithiosalicylate which has activity as both a bacteriostat and a fungistat. Desirably thimerosal is present in the vaccine in a final concentration of 10 â´ percent. Furthermore, the carrier desirably also contains an immunopotentiator. Various immunopotentiators known in the art may be used. The adjuvant presently employed is 94 Drakeol 6 VR, 5 Arlacel A, 1 Tween 80. Arlacel A is a mannide monoleate Sandria Corp. . It is an irritant which has strong immunopotentiating activity when combined with antigens. Drakeol 6 VR is a hypoallergenic light mineral oil product Penreco Corp. . Tween 80 is a monoleate derivative of polyoxyethylsorbitan and possesses detergent properties. Other suitable carriers or immunopotentiators include aluminum potassium sulfate, aluminum hydroxide, lymphokines and water in oil emulsions. By administering a suitable dose of such a vaccine to a chicken, the chicken is protected against infection by Other embodiments of this invention include a monoclonal antibody directed against the A4 protein and a monoclonal antibody directed against an antigenic polypeptide of this invention. A specific embodiment is the previously mentioned monoclonal antibody designated Ptn 7.2A4 4 produced by hybridoma cell line ATCC No. HB8561. One can confer upon a chicken passive immunity against infection by In a further embodiment a composite structure having spatial features common with those of the principal protective structures of the A4 antigen is substituted for the previously described antigens. One such composition includes an anti idiotypic antibody developed against the structures of an antibody to the A4 protein or to one of the antigenic polypeptides of this invention, e.g. the monoclonal antibody Ptn 7.2A4 4, which structures confer specificity toward the respective antigen determinant. Such anti idiotype antibodies can in themselves be monoclonal in nature, or can be raised as polyclonal antibodies. In the former example, the antibody Ptn 7.2A4 4 can be recovered from hybridoma cell line ATCC No. HB8561, purified and covalently attached to any suitable carrier protein, e.g. the key hole limpet hemocyanin KLH . The purified antibody, preferably the purified antibody KLH complex, is repeatedly injected, preferably with an adjuvant such as Freund s complete adjuvant, into a suitable mammalian lymphocyte donor with Balb C strain mice as the preferred donor. Hybridomas are developed from lymphocytes of the immunized mice. The hybridomas are screened for antibodies which compete with the A4 antigen for reaction with the monoclonal antibody Ptn 7.2A4 4, but recognize neither the A4 antigen nor murine immunoglobulin other than Ptn 7.2A4 4. Such hybridomas secreting anti idiotype antibodies toward monoclonal antibody Ptn 7.2A4 4 are further expanded and cloned. Production of anti idiotype antibody can be performed by cultures of cells in any medium suitable for growth of hybridomas and expression of monoclonal antibodies, or growth of antibody producing hybridomas in host animals, with Balb C mice as the preferred vehicle. Anti idiotype antibody can also be produced by injection of Ptn 7.2A4 4 into animals. One preferred method is to repeatedly inject 500 micrograms of Ptn 7.2A4 4, purified and formulated in a suitable adjuvant, e.g. Complete Freunds Adjuvant, into a suitable animal, e.g. a rabbit. After sufficient injections, blood serum is removed after a suitable period of time from such animals. The anti idiotypic antibodies are then recovered from the blood serum, e.g. by adsorption against normal mouse serum proteins immobilized on an insoluble support such as Sepharose . Specificity of the resulting antiserum is confirmed by demonstrating reactivity with monoclonal antibody Ptn 7.2A4 4 but none against normal murine Î³3 K . The anti idiotype antibodies prepared as above are further purified to the level of IgG fractions. Purified anti idiotype antibody protein may be administered by any of a number of well known methods as described for the antigen proper. Administering an effective amount of the anti idiotypic antibody of this invention to a chicken provides a method of conferring upon the chicken active immunity against infection by The amount of anti idiotype antibody per dose must be sufficient to invoke production of an antibody in an animal to whom the vaccine is administered. For induction of an immunological response as measured by antibody production, the amount of anti idiotype antibody per dose is above 50 Âµg Kg body weight of the vaccinated birds. Thus, the amount of anti idiotype antibody administered to a 50g day old chick would be 2.5Âµg. Presently preferred is a vaccine containing 25 Âµg of anti idiotype antibody. In general, the anti idiotype antibody will comprise on a weight basis from 0.002 percent to up to 0.2 percent of the vaccine, and the dose volume will be 0.2 cc. Another aspect of the invention is a nucleic acid molecule, e.g. DNA, cDNA, RNA or mRNA, encoding the A4 protein. One embodiment is a DNA molecule having the nucleic acid sequence set forth in Figure 3. Another embodiment is a DNA molecule encoding one of the antigenic polypeptides of this invention. A further embodiment is a cloning vehicle which comprises a nucleic acid molecule of this invention, e.g. encoding the A4 protein or one of the previously described antigenic polypeptides. The cloning vehicle may be contained in a host cell, e.g. a bacterial host cell. The protein having the amino acid sequence set forth in Figure 3 may be produced using host cells containing a cloning vehicle which contains the nucleic acid molecule encoding the A4 protein. In accordance with this method, the host cells are grown under suitable conditions permitting production of the protein, and the protein so produced is recovered. The antigenic polypeptides of this invention may be similarly prepared using an appropriate nucleic acid molecule encoding the polypeptide. When the host cell is a bacterial cell, the A4 protein produced has the same or essentially the same sequence as the natural A4 protein but may differ in its amino acid sequence or at its amino terminus because of expression in the bacterial host, e.g. by addition of an N terminal methionine molecule or by virtue of being produced and recovered as a single, unprocessed protein. A further embodiment concerns a method for obtaining the DNA molecule having the nucleic acid sequence set forth in Figure 3. The method involves isolating genomic DNA from Lesions were scored by the method of Johnson and Reid 20 . The lesions in infected birds were typical of Monoclonal antibodies were derived from hybridomas developed using the method of VanDeusen and Whetstone 55 . Briefly, Balb C ByJ mice were repeatedly immunized with 10â¶ 10â· intact The microneutralization assay was performed with primary chick kidney cell cultures. 1 to 2 week old chicks were sacrificed and aseptically nephrectomized. The kidneys were trypsinized, and cells plated into 96 well cultures at a density of approximately 10â´ well in Earle s LAH medium supplemented with 5 heat inactivated fetal calf serum. Cultures were maintained at 41 IFA slides were prepared with sporozoites of Of the several thousand hybridomas developed against A total of 2x10â¸ oocysts from The one ml samples were put into glass scintillation vials which had been coated with 40 Âµg of IODOGEN 1,3,4,6 tetrachloro 3Î±, 6Î± diphenylglycouril solid phase iodination reagent, dried under nitrogen gas and rinsed with PBS. To each tube, 0.5 mCi of Â¹Â²âµI was added and the samples allowed to incubate for 20 minutes on ice. Afterward, 100 Âµl of KI 1 M was added to each tube to a final concentration of 100 mM, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for an additional 15 minutes on ice. Sporozoite and sporocyst preparations were then diluted to 7 ml with PBS containing 5 mM KI and pelleted at 45,000 RPM for 45 minutes at 4 Â¹Â²âµI labeled sporocyst and sporozoite pellets from the above high speed centrifugation were resuspended in 1 ml of protein extraction buffer 20 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.5 50 mM MgClâ 25 mM NaCl, 1 NP40, 1 mM PMSF, 0.1 mM TPCK, 1 mM TLCK and 10 KIU ml aprotinin . The suspensions were incubated for 30 minutes on ice with occasional vortexing. Insoluble material was separated from the detergent solubilized protein in a microfuge for 15 minutes at 4 Ten microliters of each sample were diluted into 90 Âµl of 5 mM KI. Ten microliters of each diluted sample was then added to a solution containing 1 ml of 5 trichloroacetic acid TCA , 25 Âµl BSA 10 mg ml and 5 mM KI and incubated on ice for 30 minutes. The precipitated samples were collected by filtration through glass fiber filters, washed twice with 5 ml of 5 TCA, 5 mM KI and three times with 5 ml of 95 ethanol, both at 0 Total Â¹Â²âµI labeled sporocyst, sporozoite and soluble membrane proteins and immunoprecipitated proteins see below were analyzed on 120x100x0.75 mm, 5 25 exponential gradient SDS polyacrylamide gels at 20 mA for 3 hours. The gels were dried and used to expose x ray film at 70 Gels used for staining purposes were visualized by silver staining. Fifty microliters of hybridoma supernatant containing monoclonal antibody were added to 25 Âµl of monoclonal antibody dilution buffer MAB DIL 50 mM Tris HCl, pH 8.6 150 mM NaCl 0.1 NP40 0.1 BSA, RIA grade 1 mM TLCK 1 mM PMSF, 10 KIU ml aprotinin . Twenty microliters of Â¹Â²âµI labeled protein was then added and the tube was vigorously mixed and then incubated overnight at 4 The same procedure was used as described in the section concerning immunoprecipitation with monoclonal antibodies with a few exceptions. Sera were diluted 1 10 in 90 Âµl of antibody dilution buffer AB DIL 10 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.5 0.1 BSA RIA grade 1 mM PMSF 1 mM TLCK 10 KIU ml aprotinin prior to the addition of 20 Âµl of Â¹Â²âµI labeled protein. The antibody wash buffer ABW consists of 10 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 BSA RIA grade 1 mM PMSF 1 mM TLCK, 10 KIU ml aprotinin 0.05 NP40 0.05 Triton X 100, 5 mM KI. The surface labeled Sera from chickens immunized by repeated intravenous injections of killed From the iodinated sporocyst and sporozoite membrane preparations, the 17,000 and 6,500 dalton polypeptides, respectively, are specifically immunoprecipitated by anti sera from chickens immunized as described above. Sera from specific pathogen free control chickens do not appear to recognize any Under the conditions in which the immunoprecipitated, iodinated polypeptides were analyzed on SDS PAGE as described above, polypeptides linked by disulfide bonds have been separated. However, reduction of disulfide bonds destroys A4 reactivity on Western blots in both sporocyst and sporozoite membrane preparations. When iodinated sporocyst and sporozoite membrane preparations were run on SDS PAGE under non reducing conditions the major radiolabeled species migrates with an apparent molecular weight of 21 23,000. Furthermore, this 21 23,000 dalton species was reactive with monoclonal antibody A4 by western blotting Vectastain ABC Kit for Mouse IgG, Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA . These results suggest that the 17,000 dalton polypeptide in sporocyst membranes and the 6,500 dalton polypeptide in sporozoite membranes are complexed to another polypeptide s in the A4 antigen. The fact that this other polypeptide component of the A4 antigen was not observed in immunoprecipitation experiments of iodinated material can be explained by the observation that this other polypeptide does not contain any tyrosines that could be iodinated see description of the 8,000 dalton polypeptide component of the A4 antigen in Examples 5 and 6 . Alternatively to purification by gel electrophoresis the sporocyst membrane proteins from the DEAE cellulose column were dialyzed against 10 mM Tris HCl, pH8, 0.05 NP 40 and applied to a DEAE HPLC column BioRad equilibrated in this buffer. The column was developed with a NaCl gradient 0 300 mM in the same buffer. The 17,000 dalton polypeptide identified by its migration on gel electrophoresis was found in material eluting at 200 mM NaCl. Fractions containing this protein were applied to a hydroxylapatite column HPHT BioRad equilibrated with 30 mM potassium phosphate, pH 6.5, 0.05 Zwittergent 3 12 Calbiochem Behring, LaJolla, CA 0.1 mM dithiothreitol. The column was washed with equilibration buffer and developed with a potassium phosphate gradient 0 300 mM containing 0.05 Zwittergent and 0.1 mM dithiothreitol. The 17,000 dalton polypeptide identified by gel electrophoresis described above appeared in material eluting at approximately 90 mM potassium phosphate. The fractions containing the 17,000 dalton polypeptide purified by this method also contained a second peptide of 8,000 daltons. This peptide appears to be linked by a disulfide bridge to the 17,000 dalton polypeptide. If the fractions containing the 17,000 dalton peptide were immuno precipitated with monoclonal antibody A4 and the precipitated proteins were analyzed by gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions as above both the 17,000 and 8,000 dalton polypeptides appear to be immunoprecipitated. Hence in sporocyst membrane preparations the 8,000 dalton and 17,000 dalton polypeptides appear to be linked by a disulfide bond presumably by a cysteine bridge because the two peptides did not appear on electrophoresis unless a strong reducing agent was present. Under non reducing conditions the A4 reactive species migrates with an apparent molecular weight of 21 23,000. For microtiter plate ELISA polystyrene 96 well clusters Immulon II were sensitized with antigen in 10 mM glycine buffered saline, pH 9.6, incubated overnight at 37 As will be shown in Examples 5 and 6 the gene encoding the A4 antigen encodes a 25,000 dalton protein. This protein is subsequently processed by proteolysis to produce 17,000 and 8,000 dalton peptides which are linked by a disulfide bond. Both the 11,500 and 6,500 dalton fragments of the A4 antigen are believed to be fragments of the 17,000 dalton peptide. Since the 6,500 dalton fragment labels well with iodine whereas the 8,000 dalton peptide does not iodinate we conclude the 6,500 dalton fragment is derived from the 17,000 dalton peptide. The 11,500 dalton fragment is seen on reducing SDS PAGE and therefore must be derived from the 17,000 dalton peptide. The exact location of these two fragments within the 17,000 dalton peptide is unknown. Amino acid sequencing of the 17,000 dalton peptide was complicated by the finding that the N terminal amino acid was blocked i.e. not accessible to Edman degradation 12 . To circumvent this problem the protein was reduced and alkylated and then digested with various chemicals and enzymes. The resulting peptides were purified by reverse phase HPLC 17 . The 17,000 dalton polypeptide or the A4 antigen was digested with CNBr CN , V8 protease V , chymotrypsin CH and Endoprotease Arg C R . Before protease digestion the purified 17,000 dalton polypeptide or the A4 antigen was treated with 30 mM dithiothreitol, 6M guanidine HCl pH 8 for 1 hour at room temperature. Solid iodoacetamide was added to a final concentration of 100 mM, the pH was readjusted to 8 and the sample was incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. Following reduction and alkylation samples were purified from reagents either by P6DG Bio Rad, Richmond Cal. spin columns equilibrated in 0.1M MOPS, pH 7.5, 0.1 SDS or by reverse phase HPLC. For CNBr digestion the protein sample was treated with 1 CNBr in 70 formic acid for 20 hours at 4 Amino acid sequencing was performed using a gas phase sequencer Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA according to the procedure of Hunkapiller et al. 16 . Phenylthiocarbamyl PTC derivatized amino acids were analyzed by HPLC 5 . The N terminal amino acid was determined directly by removing the blocking agent. The 17,000 dalton peptide was treated with pyroglutamate aminopeptidase 5 1 protein PAP in 0.1M potassium phosphate pH 8.0 , 10 mM EDTA, 5 glycerol, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.05 Zwittergent 3 12 for 1 hour at 37 The complete amino acid sequence for the 17,000 dalton peptide component of the A4 antigen is shown in Figure 1. When the purified 8,000 dalton peptide derived from the A4 antigen by reduction and alkylation was subjected to Edman sequencing the N terminal amino acid sequence could be determined directly. A partial amino acid sequence of the N terminal region of the peptide is shown below Sporulated oocysts 5x10â¸ were washed and sporocysts were isolated as described previously. Isolated sporocysts were washed 2X with 0.1M Tris HCL, pH 8.5 , 0.2M NaCl, 10mM EDTA. Sporocysts were lysed by incubation for 30 min. at 65 The Oligonucleotide probes that would be complementary to regions of the gene encoding the 17,000 dalton peptide component of the A4 antigen were synthesized using a Biosearch Sam I Biosearch, Inc., San Rafael, CA . The expected DNA sequences of the appropriate regions were deduced from the amino acid sequence of the 17,000 dalton peptide. Because of the ambiguity in the genetic code, the exact DNA sequence cannot be predicted. Mixed probes were designed and synthesized which contained a mixture of DNA sequences, one of which should have perfect match homology with the gene for the 17,000 dalton peptide. Oligonucleotide COD 92 was based on amino acids 6 to 12 of peptide VI see Example 5 for the amino acid sequence of the 17,000 dalton peptide . It contained a mixture of 256 different sequences. The structure of oligonucleotide COD 92 is Oligonucleotide COD 94 was based on amino acids 3 to 8 of peptide V2 of the 17,000 dalton peptide. It contained a mixture of 64 different sequences Oligonucleotide COD 108 was based on amino acids 25 30 of peptide V1. It contained a mixture of 16 different sequences. The structure of oligonucleotide COD 108 is Recombinant phage of the Small blocks of agar were cut from the plates in regions that corresponded to the region of the filter containing the hybridizing DNA. The phage were eluted, replated at lower density 20 100 plate and rescreened with all three oligonucleotide probes. Pure isolated positive plaques or clones were picked. Phage 108 1 hybridized strongly to oligonucleotide COD 92 and moderately to oligonucleotides COD 108 and 94. Phage 108 1 was grown up on a larger scale for purification and characterization of the The 5,500 bp Eco RI fragment insert of clone 108 1 was subcloned from the Î»phage vector into plasmid pUC 9 56 . The recombinant plasmids were digested with a variety of restriction endonucleases to determine the position of key restriction sites in the genomic DNA clone. The position of restriction sites within the DNA was needed to determine the location and orientation of the 17,000 dalton peptide gene and to develop a strategy to sequence the Eco RI genomic DNA fragment. The restriction map is presented in Figure 2. The location and orientation of the gene for the 17,000 dalton peptide is shown on this map. The BglII Eco RI fragment of clone 108 1 containing the gene for the 17,000 dalton peptide component of the A4 antigen was sequenced by the dideoxy method of Sanger 44 using various restriction enzyme fragments. Primers for DNA synthesis included oligonucleotides COD 92, 94 and 108 as well as other synthetic oligonucleotides. The DNA sequence is shown in Figure 3. The DNA sequence agrees with that predicted by the amino acid sequence analysis. In addition there are three features of the gene which are not apparent from the protein sequence. Using protein sequence information and general information regarding the structure of secretory proteins we have deduced the structure of the gene for the A4 antigen. From the known amino terminus of the sporocyst membrane 17,000 dalton peptide see Example 5 , Gln Asp Tyr , we see that the gene encodes an extra 23 amino acids upstream. This DNA sequence is a typical signal sequence found at the amino terminus of genes for many secretory or membrane proteins 23, 3 . The peptide it encodes is required for the export of proteins from their site of synthesis the cytoplasm to and or through the plasma membrane. The signal peptide is usually removed during the secretory process. It is not surprising that the A4 antigen is made with a signal peptide since it most likely traverses the cytoplasmic membrane in order to be found at the outer surface of the sporozoite. The amino terminus of the signal sequence is assumed to be the Met codon since, essentially, synthesis of all proteins begin with methionine. There are three regions of the gene in which the DNA sequence does not coincide with the protein sequence. The first is a 101 bp segment occurring within the codon for Val 7 of the known mature 17,000 dalton protein sequence. The second is a 114 bp sequence between the codons for Gly 65 and Gly 66 of the 17,000 dalton peptide. The third is a 124 bp sequence within the codon for Asp 186 of the 8,000 dalton peptide. These three sequences are intron structures typically found within the coding regions of many eukaryotic genes. They are present in the precursor to the mRNA, and then removed by an RNA recombination mechanism known as splicing, to give the mature mRNA with an uninterrupted coding sequence. The DNA sequences around the splice junctions are consistent with those seen in other eukaryotic genes 47 . The sequence of the 17,000 dalton peptide appears to terminate with the sequence Gly Gly corresponding to codons 157 and 158. We have also identified an 8,000 dalton peptide with the sequence beginning with Ala 162 extending to Glu 188. The peptide sequence Arg Arg Leu corresponding to codons 159 through 161 has not been found. It is probable that this tripeptide is removed by a mechanism similar to the cleavage of other proteins such as insulin 53 . Hence the two peptides of the A4 antigen are encoded by a contiguous nucleotide sequence, and at least one proteolytic step occurs to generate the 8,000 dalton peptide beginning with Ala 162. The A4 anti idiotype antibody was prepared by sensitizing rabbits with purified A4 monoclonal antibody. Non immune mouse serum was ammonium sulfate 50 saturated precipitated and the precipitated proteins resuspended in PBS and passed over a Sephadex G 25 column to remove residual salt. Peak fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 100 mM NaHCOâ, 500 mM NaCl, pH 8.3 and covalently bound to CNBr activated Sepharose. Intracloacal and oral inoculation with sporozoites was done using syringe and coagulation tip. The appropriate number of sporozoites was given in either 0.5 or 1 ml dose. In experiment 1, three birds died of coccidiosis between days 4 and 5 in the control group receiving 10â¶ sporozoites. There was one mortality in the treatment group. Likewise, lesion scores and hematocrit readings indicated a more severe infection in the control groups than in the treatment groups. The results in a second experiment showed that birds receiving The A4 antigen used in these experiments was prepared from sporocycts by methods described in Example 4 for the preparation of the nonreduced intact A4 antigen. Purity and identity of the protein was confirmed by SDS PAGE and immunoreactivity with monoclonal antibody Ptn 7.2A4 4 prior to use in chickens. Vaccine preparations were formulated at a level of one volume antigen to three volumes of oil carrier consisting of 5 Arlacel A, 94 Drakeol 6 VR, 1 Tween 80 so that each 0.1 ml dose contained approximately 15 Âµg of A4 antigen. When necessary, antigen was diluted with PBS pH 7.2 to the level desired for formulation. Chickens received 0.1 ml dose by intramuscular route in the neck muscle. Antigen was administered two more times by the same route using the same amount at two week intervals. Three days prior to each administration of protein, and eleven days after the final administration, birds were bled for collection of serum samples. Heat inactivated sera were tested independently in the sporozoite microneutralization assay as described in Example 1. The results as set forth below indicate that whereas non vaccinated birds receiving carrier only had no demonstrable neutralizing antiserum titers against Sixty three 63 days after the final vaccinataion, some birds were challenged, orally with 1,000 sporulated The 11,500 dalton immunogen used in these experiments was prepared from sporocysts by phenol extraction as described in Example 4. Purity and identity of the protein was confirmed by SDS PAGE and immunoreactivity with monoclonal antibody Ptn 7.2A4 4 prior to use in chickens. Lyophilized purified antigen was dissolved in 0.15 M phosphate buffered saline and emulsified in three parts carrier consisting of 5 Arlacel A, 94 Drakeol 6 VR, 1 Tween 80 at a final antigen concentration of 70 Âµg ml. Chickens received 14 Âµg protein 0.2 cc dose by intra muscular route in the neck muscle. Antigen was again administered two weeks later by the same route using the same amount. One day prior to each administration of protein, and two weeks after the second administration of protein, birds were bled for collection of serum samples. Heat inactivated sera were tested independently in the sporozoite microneutralization assay as described in Example 1. The results as set forth below indicate that whereas non vaccinated birds receiving carrier only had no demonstrable neutralizing antiserum titers against Birds received approximately 3 Âµg of antigen in the aforementioned carrier one time in the neck muscle. A second group of birds received the carrier substance only. A final group of non vaccinate sentinal birds was housed with each of the two aforementioned groups. Birds were exposed to coccidia by being housed in Because the conditions described above closely mimic the natural means of exposure to Analysis of serum antibody specificity for the 17,000 dalton polypeptide component of the A4 antigen was performed using Western blots 4,46 .All chicken sera with demonstrable neutralization titers to Sera from vaccinated birds with demonstrable neutralization titers to Heat inactivated sera from birds vaccinated with the 11,500 dalton fragment of the A4 antigen Example 9 were pooled and tested in the neutralization assay Example 1 substituting embryonic porcine lung cells for embryonic chick kidney cells. The results were as listed in the following table. The data demonstrate the development of an elevated serum neutralization titer against A composition for immunization of chickens against coccidiosis caused by One composition may include that described in Example 10. The vaccine may be administered to chickens of any age by the intramuscular route. Properly vaccinated birds would be protected against disease, depressed performance or death caused by field challenge with
