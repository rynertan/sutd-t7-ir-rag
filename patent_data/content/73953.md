# Monoclonal antibodies to cell surface antigens of human renal cancer.

## Abstract
Seventeen monoclonal antibodies derived from fusions with spleen cells of mice immunized with established culture lines of renal cancers identified nine cell surface antigenic systems. Six of the systems gp 160, S25, gp120r, gp120nr, gp115, and V1 represents antigens not previously described. The most restricted of the newly described antigens are gp160, S25, and gpl120r. These determinants are found only on cells or renal origin, both normal and malignant, and represent differentiation antigens of human kidney. These systems can be used to characterize and study the nature of renal cancer. Thus, comparison of the S25 and the gp160 phenotypes of different renal cancer cell lines and cultures of normal kidney clearly distinguish these two systems.
