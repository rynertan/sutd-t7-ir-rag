# Automatic locking slider for slide fasteners.

## Abstract
An automatic lock slider 10 for slide fasteners com prises a slider body 12 including an upper 13 and a lower wing 14 defining therebetween a guide channel 16 for the passage of slide fastener coupling elements, a locking mem ber 25 for locking the slider against movement, a pull tab 11 operatively associated with the locking member 25 for man ipulating the slider, a casing 36 and a spring member 35 in terposed between the casing and the locking member and normally urging the latter in a direction to lock the slider. The casing 36 has retaining lugs 36c, 36d interiorly disposed for folding over the spring member 35 to retain the latter in posi tion stably but loosely to permit its resilient movement relative to the locking member 25 .
