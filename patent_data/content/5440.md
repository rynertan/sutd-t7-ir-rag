## Description
FILAMENT REINFORCED PLASTIC ARTICLEBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to improved electrically conductive, filament reinforced plastic articles, such as plastic sheets and pipe. Plastic pipe has been used for many years to provide corrosion proof conduits in many different types of industries. A disadvantage of prior art plastic pipe is that it can develop a dangerous electrostatic charge because of its low electrical conductivity. For example, Lloyd s of London requires that all fiberglass pipe used to handle petroleum products on board ship have a surface resistivity of less than 109 ohms when tested in accordance with ASTM D257 76 so that static charges built up in the pipe by fluid flow may be conducted to ground. Conventional fiberglass reinforced pipe made before this invention has a surface resistivity of about 1012 ohms, and therefore is unsatisfactory for such applications. Economically priced, electrically conductive plastic sheets would also find wide use to shield against radio frequency electromagnetic radiation. Before this invention, conductive materials, such as graphite, carbon, silver, aluminum, and copper powder and particles, have been incorporated into rubber and plastic procucts to make them more conductive to prevent static charge buildup, or to make radio frequency shields. Chopped metallic fibers and chopped conductive glass filaments have also been used in plastic products to increase electrical conductivity. The article entitled Conductive PolymericCompositions in Polymer Enqineerinq and Science, Dec. 1977, Vol. 17, No. 12, discloses the use of conductive fibers, spheres, flakes, and irregular particulates of conductive materials to increase the thermal and electrical conductivity of plastic articles.The article states that fibrous conductors improve conductivity more significantly than spheres, flakes, or irregular particles. However, the article limits its disclosure to particles and short glass fibers having a maximum aspect ratio of no more than approximately 35 1. The aspect ratio is the ratio of the length of a conductive member to its diameter. Moreover, the use of conductive powder, particles, and chopped filaments is expensive, because relatively large amounts of these materials are required to achieve the necessary modification of electrical conductivity. Thus, although the advantages of electrically conductive plastic have long been known, their use has been limited in many applications, because they have not been economically feasible before this invention. In making conventional filament reinforced plastic pipe, hundreds of filaments of reinforcing material, such as fiberglass, nylon, etc., are combined to form an end or roving. About 15 ends are combined to form a strands, which includes several thousand individual filaments and between about ten and about 40 strands are combined to form a tape, web, or band, which is saturated with liquid resin to coat the individual filaments with plastic. The resinsaturated band is wound onto a rotating mandrel. The winding path is usually a simple helix at an angle of about 540 to the mandrel axis of rotation. A uniformly reinforced pipe wall is formed by winding the band in overlapping helices, first to the right along the mandrel and then to the left.The filaments are substantially continuous, unidirectional fibers, and may be mineral fibers, such as glass or asbestos animal fibers, such as wool, vegetable fibers, such as cotton or synthetic fibers, such as nylon, rayon, dacron, orlon, and the like. The resin or adhesive used to impregnate the band and wet the filaments can be any suitable thermosetting or thermoplastic resin used in winding or laminating procedures.For example, binders containing a thermosetting resin, such as epoxy, polyester, vinyl ester, furan, phenol formaldehyde, or the like, or binders containing a thermoplastic resin, such as polyvinyl chloride, polyvinylidene chloride, or the like can be used. U. S. Patent No. 3,499,815 to Hof, and U. S. Patent No.3,519,520 to Newman describe apparatus and methods for making conventional fiber reinforced plastic pipe. Such pipe is satisfactory under many conditions where resistance to corrosion is required, but it is of limited use where buildup of electrostatic charge creates a hazardous condition. U. S. Patent No. 3,070,132 to Sheridan U. S. PatentNo. 3,555,170 to Petzetakis U. S. Patent No. 3,580,983 toJackson U. S. Patent No. 3,958,066 to Imamura et al andU. S. Patent No. 3,963,856 to Carlson et al describe various conventional ways of increasing the thermal and electrical conductivity of plastic products by using metal wires or particles of metal or carbon imbedded in the product. As indicated above, this technique is expensive and has not been widely used to produce plastic pipes, for example, on a commercial basis.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention provides a relatively inexpensive filament reinforced plastic material with a sufficiently high electrical conductivity to satisfy safety requirements for use in plastic pipe on board ship, and to make effective radio frequency shields. The filament reinforced plastic article of this invention includes a wall made of overlapping bands of continuous filaments coated with plastic. A minor portion of the filaments in at least one of the bands is metal coated to make them electrically conductive. This provides a plastic article which has a surprisingly high electrical conductivity, and yet contains very little metal. Preferably, the filaments are fiberglass, and the electrically conductive filaments carry a thin coating of metal on the exterior surface. In the preferred method of the invention for making the articles, the bands of conventional and electrically conductive, continuous filaments coated with liquid resin are wound around a mandrel in overlapping helical patterns to form a tubular reinforced wall of the desired thickness. If the final product is to be plastic pipe, the resin is cured to a sufficiently rigid condition on the mandrel to permit its removal without losing its tubular shape. If the final product is to be a sheet of plastic which may be molded into a shield against radio frequency electromagnetic radiation, the curing of the resin on the mandrel is stopped short of completion, so the wall of the article is still flexible. While still on the mandrel, the wall of the tubular article or laminate is cut through along a line parallel to the longitudinal axis of the mandrel to make a sheet which can be formed and cured into a rigid article of the desired shape. The tubular wall can also be cut in other directions. For example, it can be cut in a spiral along a line perpendicular to the bands. DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 is a fragmentary elevation, partly broken away, of two adjacent ends of sections of pipe made in accordance with this invention and bonded together with a conductive adhesive FIG. 2 is a cross sectionel view of a conductive glass filament used in making the pipe of this invention and FIG. 3 is an enlarged cross sectional view taken in the area of 3 3 of FIG. 1. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Referring to FIG. 1, a first pipe section 10, having a male end 12, is bonded by a layer 13 of adhesive to a second pipe section 14, having a female end 16. The adhesive layer is conventional epoxy resin which includes about 78 by weight of conductive filaments chopped to length of about 3 8 inch. Each section of pipe was formed by wrapping resinsaturated bands webs or tapes 18 of continuous filaments in a helical pattern around a rotating mandrel not shown .The winding path was a simple helix at an angle of about 540 to the mandrel axis of rotation. A uniformly reinforced pipe wall was thus formed by depositing the bands, first to the right along the mandrel and then to the left to form overlapping layers. Each band included nineteen strands 19 not shown in detail of conventional continuous fiberglass roving and one strand 20 of continuous conductive fiberglass filament. The twenty strands formed a band approximately 2 wide. Each strand contained 15 ends, and each end contained 408 individual filaments, making about 6,000 filaments per strand. The amount of conductive fiberglass filaments can be reduced by using more strands of conventional glass in a band for each strand of conductive filament.For example, the band width can be 5 instead of 2 , while still using only one strand of conductive roving in the band.The conductive filaments may be of the type described in an article entitled, Conductive Polymeric Compositions , byDonald M. Bigg, appearing in the December 1977 issue ofPolymer Engineering and Science. Conductive filaments useful in this invention may also be obtained from MBA Associates. Such a product typically yields from 220 yards to 1,200 yards of strand per pound. FIG. 2 shows a typical conductive filament 22 in crosssection. It includes a conventional cylindrical glass fiber 24 about 0.8 mil in diameter. A coating 26 of aluminum 0.1 mil thick is deposited on the glass fiber for its entire length, but extends only one half way around the fiber so that only one half the surface of the fiber is coated with aluminum. Of course, the conductive filaments can be entirely coated with aluminum, or any other suitable material. The filaments used in this invention, both conductive and non conductive, are continuous throughout the length of the article which they reinforce. Thus, the continuous conductive filaments have enormous aspect ratios ratio of length to diameter of 500 1, or greater. For example, a continuous conductive filament in a pipe section 20 feet long has an aspect ratio greater than 240,000 1. The filaments can be mineral fibers, such as glass or asbestos animal fibers, such as wool vegetable fibers, such as cotton or synthetic fibers, such as nylon, rayon, dacron, orlon, and the like. The resin or adhesive used to impregnate the band and coat the filaments can be any suitable thermosetting or thermoplastic resin used in winding or laminating procedures. For example, binders containing a thermosetting resin, such as epoxy, polyester, melamine formaldehyde, ureaformaldehyde, phenol formaldehyde, or the like, or binders containing a thermoplastic resin, such as polyvinyl chloride, polyvinylidene chloride, or the like can be used. A pipe such as the one shown in FIG. 1 was made to have a nominal diameter of 2 an average o.d. of 2.384 inches and an average i.d. of 2.098 inches . The pipe included a conventional liner 28 with an average wall thickness of 0.023 inch, thus giving an average reinforced wall thickness of 0.120 inch. The liner known in the industry as C veil reinforced liner was wound on the mandrel first, followed by two layers of the epoxy resin saturated bands of conventional fiberglass filaments and conductive glass filaments.Each layer included two circuits, which each required one pass of a band in each direction along the mandrel. Thus, the pipe was made by first wrapping the mandrel with one pass of 10 mil C veil material with a 2 3 overlap. A first layer was then formed by making a pass in one direction with the band and then making a pass In the opposite direction to form a first circuit. An additional circuit was similarly formed to complete the first layer. Ultimately, two layers were formed to produce the final wall pipe thickness. In all, eight passes along the mandrel were required with the band to produce two circuits per layer, each circuit including a pass in each direction along the mandrel. Other meth odes and materials, well known to those skilled in making plastic pipe, can be used. After the pipe was formed, the resin was gelled under infrared lights, and then post cured for one hour at 300OF. The pipe contained approximately 2.9 conductive glass or about 0.4 metal by weight. The d.c. electrical resistance of the pipe tested in accordance with ASTM D257 76 was 8.3 x 101 ohms, which was well under the maximum resistance of 109 ohms set by Lloyd s of London. A conventional fiberglass reinforced plastic pipe made in exactly the same manner, except omitting the strand of conductive glass roving in the band used to build up the pipe wall, had a resistance of 2.68 x 1012 ohms. A similar conductive pipe was made as described above, except that it contained only 1.3 conductive glass, or about 0.28 metal by weight. It also had a resistivity well below the limit set by Lloyd s of London. Since the C veil material which lines the pipe interior does not include any electrically conductive filaments, its electrical resistivity is higher than that of the exterior surface of the pipe. For those applications where low resistivity is required for the pipe interior, and the chemical inertness of the C veil material is not required, it can be omitted. Alternatively, a strand 20 as shown in FIG. 3 of conductive filaments is wound around the mandrel before applyingtheC veil liner 28 to increase the electrical conductivity of the inside surface of the pipe. The initial strand of conductive filaments and the C veil liner are each saturated with liquid resin before being wrapped around the mandrel so they are bonded to each other when the resin is cured. If the plastic material of this invention is used to make a sheet for radio frequency shielding, a procedure sim i to that for making pipe is followed. However, the Cveil is omitted, and a first protective sheet not shown of polyethylene plastic not shown , or any other suitable material to which the epoxy resin will not readily adhere, is first wrapped around the mandrel. Thereafter, a tubular laminate is formed around the mandrel exactly as described above. A second protective sheet not shown of polyethylene plastic is wrapped around the exterior of the laminate.Thereafter, and before the resin has set to a permanently rigid state, the second protective sheet and the wall of the laminate on the mandrel are cut through along a line extending substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of the mandrel. Alternatively, the second sheet and laminate wall are cut through on a spiral path or any other desired path perpendicular to one set of the helices. The laminate is then removed from the mandrel as a flat sheet. The sheet is stored, in a refrigerated space if necessary, to prevent further curing of the resin until the sheet is to be formed into its final configuration. At that time, the sheet is forced into the desired shape, the the protective sheets are removed, and the resin then cured to a rigid state. The product provides a shield against radio frequency radiation, even though it contains less than about 0.5 metal by weight. The sheet form of the invention is as shown in detail in FIG. 3. It includes a wall 30 made up of epoxy resin and filaments of conventional fiberglass not shown and fiberglass filaments 32 coated with aluminum. For the sake of simplicity, only the strands of the conductive fiberglass filaments are shown. From the foregoing description, it will be apparent that the process and plastic article of this invention can be used to make a great variety of electrically conductive articles, including pipe and shaped members, such as pipe fittings, structural members, and the like. The surprising result of this invention is that altough the continuous conductive filaments form such a small sart of the total article, and even though the conductive filaments are coated with non conducting cured resin, the final product has an exceptionally low surface resistivity, which makes it ideal to use in those applications where the buildup of electrostatic charges cannot be tolerated. The product also provides r f shielding, even though it contains so little metal.
