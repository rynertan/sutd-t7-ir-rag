## Description
The present invention relates to a novel process for the preparation of 2 alkoxy N 1 azabicyclo 2.2.2 octan 3 yl aminobenzamides which have gastrokinetic and antiemetic pharmacologic properties. The process utilizes an N,N dialkylcarbodiimide condensation agent such as N,N dicyclohexylcarbodiimide DCC to react a strong mineral acid salt of 3 aminoquinuclidine or a loweralkyl substituted 3 aminoquinuclidine with an aminobenzoic acid derivative to form a benzamide in a medium comprised of 50 to 90 volume pyridine and 50 to 10 volume water wherein the equivalent ratio of strong acid to 3 aminoquinuclidinyl radical is 1 1 during reaction. The products of the invention always have a 2 methoxy radical and an amino radical on the benzene ring and may have other radicals on the benzene ring and are variously referred to herein as above or as quinuclidinyl subst aminobenzamides. Preparation of amides from a carboxylic acid and an amine utilizing an N,N dialkylcarbodiimide as condensation agent in certain organic solvents is a known general procedure. However, the use of pyridine and water is not a general practice. Moreover, the benzoic acids of the present invention are also substituted by an amino group which must remain intact during the reaction and must not enter into the condensation reaction. The high solubility of 2 alkoxy aminobenzoic acids in pyridine was not previously known. The condensation reaction between the carboxylic acid group of an adenine derivative made functional by the amine group of a macromolecule also of adenine derivation utilizes a carbodiimide, including DCC, in water or in a mixture formed by water and water soluble organic solvent e.g., pyridine, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, etc. at temperatures of 5 to 50 Preparation of N 1 azabicyclo 2.2.2 octan 3 yl benzamides substituted by an amino radical on the benzamide moiety in yields of 15 38 is disclosed in French Patent 2,529,548. In that patent a yield of 15 of 4 amino N 1 azabicyclo 2.2.2 oct 3 yl 5 chloro 2 methoxybenzamide maleate from reaction of 4 amino 5 chloro 2 methoxybenzoic acid, 3 aminoquinuclidine dihydrochloride and ethyl chloroformate in dimethylformamide and triethylamine followed by preparation of the salt was reported. The method of preparation disclosed does not employ an N,N dialkylcarbodiimide. In contrast, the present invention employs a monoprotonated strong acid salt of a 3 aminoquinuclidine in pyridine water solution. In EP A 0158532 2 alkoxy N 1 azabicyclo 2.2.2 octan 3 yl aminobenzamides were disclosed from reaction of such as 4 amino 5 chloro 2 methoxybenzoic acid and 3 aminoquinuclidine in tetrahydrofuran utilizing 1,1 carbonyldiimidazole as condensation agent. The method requires the free base of a 3 aminoquinuclidine which is difficult to obtain and the condensation agent is toxic and thus the method is impractical for large scale production. The invention is especially concerned with economical procedures for preparing 2 alkoxy N 1 azabicyclo 2.2.2 octan 3 yl aminobenzamides in consistent high yield and high purity. The 2 alkoxy N 1 azabicyclo 2.2.2 octan 3 yl aminobenzamides preparable by the process of the present invention have the formula wherein R is hydrogen or loweralkyl R¹ is loweralkyl R² is hydrogen, halo or loweralkoxy and Am is amino, methylamino or dimethylamino, and the strong mineral acid addition salts thereof. Strong mineral acids are exemplified by hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulphuric, phosphoric and methane sulphonic acid. In the further definition of symbols in the formulas hereof and where they appear elsewhere throughout this specification and the claims, the terms have the following significance. The term loweralkyl as used herein includes straight and branched chain radicals of up to eight carbons inclusive and is exemplified by such groups as methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, amyl, hexyl, heptyl, and octyl radicals. The term loweralkoxy has the formula O loweralkyl. The terms halo or halogen when referred to herein include fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine unless otherwise stated. The term N,N dialkylcarbodiimide is intended to include any condensation agent suggestive of the generic term and will produce a by product which is a water insoluble urea exemplified particularly by N,N dicyclohexylcarbodiimide DCC and N,N diisopropylcarbodiimide. The gastrokinetic pharmacological activity mentioned above was determined by the method of Droppleman, D., Gregory, R., and Alphin, R., J. Anti emetic properties are exhibited in the compounds when tested by the procedure of Chen and Enxor, Anti emetic properties in the control of emesis due to administration of platinum anti cancer drugs were determined by a modification of the method described by Gylys, J. A., in The process of the present invention is based on the discovery that 2 alkoxy N 1 azebicyclo 2.2.2 octan 3 yl aminobenzamides can be prepared in very high yields in a reasonable time of about 24 hrs or less when an N,N dialkylcarbodiimide condensation agent is added to a pyridine water solution of a 3 aminoquinuclidine mono strong acid addition salt, i.e., the ratio of strong acid to quinuclidine nitrogen is about 1 1, and a 2 alkoxy amino benzoic acid wherein during reaction, the ratio of pyridine to water may vary from about 50 50 volume to about 90 10 volume , all without uneconomical loss of the condensation agent. In the search for an economical procedure for converting these relatively high cost reactants the 3 aminoquinuclidines and the aminobenzoic acids, to the desired benzamides, it was found that the 2 alkoxy aminobenzoic acids used to prepare compounds of Formula I have relatively high solubility in pyridine compared to other common solvents such as methylene chloride, acetonitrile and basic solvents such as triethylamine or N methylmorpholine and that when such a pyridine solution is mixed with a water solution comprised of a 3 aminoquinuclidine mono strong acid salt, and may contain a salt such as sodium chloride resulting from converting a di strong acid salt of 3 aminoquinuclidine to a mono salt, a third and novel solution is formed having relatively high percentage of reactants which is advantageously prepared and used prior to addition of the condensation agent. Data in Table 1 based on the examples hereinbelow demonstrate that superior yields of about 85 95 of theory are attainable in about 24 hr reaction time when the proton ratio to quinuclidine nitrogen, i.e., the ratio of strong acid to quinuclidine nitrogen, is about 1 1 as compared to a 2 1 ratio where yields were only 41 66 of theory. It may be further stated that the reaction does not go to completion in a reasonable length of time at a higher proton ratio than about 1 1 and that much more DCC is required if the reaction time is extended to complete the reaction. Other results have shown that when the proton quinuclidine nitrogen ratio is less than about 1 1, N,N dialkylcarbodiimides are rapidly destroyed. Chemical equations illustrating reactions involved in the process are given in Chart I. The invention therefore enables the provision of a process for the efficient and economical conversion of 3 aminoquinuclidines and 2 alkoxy aminobenzoic acids to 2 alkoxy 1 azabicyclo 2.2.2 octan 3 yl aminobenzamides which are highly effective antiemetic and gastric emptying agents in monogastric animals. The invention also enables the provision of pyridine water solutions having relatively high concentrations of the 2 alkoxy aminobenzoic acids and 3 aminoquinuclidines which are useful in preparing the 2 alkoxy N 1 azabicyclo 2.2.2 octan 3 yl aminobenzamides. Additional objects will become apparent to one skilled in the art and still others will become apparent hereinafter. Accordingly this invention provides process for the preparation of a compound of general formula I which comprises reacting a 3 aminoquinuclidine acid salt of general formula II wherein R and X are as defined for general formula I and wherein the equivalent ratio of HX to quinuclidine nitrogen is about 1 1, with an aminobenzoic acid derivative of general formula III wherein R¹, R² and Am are as defined for general formula I, in the presence of an N,N dialkylcarbodiimide condensation agent in a pyridine water solution, wherein the volume pyridine to volume water ratio is in the range of from 50 50 to 90 10, at a temperature of from 0 to 50 C, to give an N 1 azabicyclo 2.2.2 octan 3 yl aminobenzamide acid addition salt of general formula I, and thereafter if desired converting the acid addition salt to the free base. Examples of the compound of formula III are 4 amino 5 chloro 2 methoxy benzoic acid and 4 N methylamino 5 chloro 2 methoxybenzoic acid. A schematic of a detailed procedure illustrating the process for preparation of the free base of the 2 alkoxy N 1 azabicyclo 2.2.2 octan 3 yl aminobenzamides, which process provides overall consistent yields of the order of 85 95 of theory based on the most expensive starting materials, the 3 aminoquinuclidine salts, is presented in Chart II. The condensation agent illustrated is DCC. The feasibility of the process depends on a combination of factors which include the use of a novel pyridine water solution of high concentration of reactants and the use of a 3 aminoquinuclidine strong acid salt in its monoprotonated ratio. In the flow diagram in Chart II the process operation is extended beyond the primary reaction step to show final isolation of the free base of the benzamide and it should be realized that the initial use of pyridine in the 50 90 vol range to water and the proton to quinuclidine nitrogen ratio of about 1 1 influences not only the amount of dialkylcarbodiimide consumed, the speed of reaction, the productivity per unit volume, the yield from starting materials throughout the process, but also the purity and lessened need to separate unreacted starting materials throughout the process. Prior to reaction i.e., addition of condensation agent e.g. DCC , a novel solution is preferably prepared comprised of pyridine, water and a 3 aminoquinuclidine mono strong acid compound of the formula wherein R is hydrogen or loweralkyl, an aminobenzoic acid compound of the formula wherein R¹ is loweralkyl R² is hydrogen, halo or loweralkoxy, and Am is amino, methylamino or dimethylamino and wherein the amount of the 3 aminoquinuclidine mono strong acid salts ranges from about 5 15 wt. , the amount of the aminobenzoic acid ranges from about 5 15 wt. and the volume ratio of pyridine to the volume ratio of water ranges from 50 50 to 90 10. The novel solution is preferably prepared by adding a strong base, preferably aqueous alkali metal base, to a water solution of a di strong acid salt of a 3 aminoquinuclidine, preferably, for example, 3 aminoquinuclidine dihydrochloride, to form a solution of the 3 aminoquinuclidine mono strong acid salt and mixing the aqueous solution with a pyridine solution of the aforesaid aminobenzoic acid to form a solution of both reactants. Comprehensively stated, the overall preferred process of the invention when extended beyond the initial reaction step to include work up and final isolation of the free base, is comprised of reacting monoprotonated strong acid salt of a 3 aminoquinuclidine, Formula II above, preferably prepared by reacting a strong base with the dihydrochloride salt and a 2 alkoxy aminobenzoic acid derivative, Formula III above, in a 50 90 vol. pyridine to 50 10 vol. water solution and using an N,N dialkylcarbodiimide condensation agent, e.g., DCC, to give the 2 alkoxy N 1 azabicyclo 2.2.2 octan 3 yl aminobenzamide acid addition salt and adding water if necessary to dissolve said benzamide acid addition salt and filtering to remove by product N,N dialkylurea to give a solution comprised of pyridine, water and an acid addition salt of said benzamide, azeotroping off the pyridine and isolating the acid salt or further purifying by neutralizing the acid salt with a strong base and isolating the free base of a 2 alkoxy N 1 azabicyclo 2.2.2 octan 3 yl aminobenzamide by conventional means. If desired, the free base may be reconverted to the same acid addition salt or converted to another acid addition salt such as maleate, oxalate, fumarate or hydrobromide. The invention encompasses the following novel steps singly or in consecutive combination, i.e., 1 alone, 1 and 2 alone or 1, 2 and 3 and the novel solution of reactants prepared in step 1 prior to addition of condensation agent and described hereinabove. Step 1, reacting a 3 aminoquinuclidine acid addition salt having the formula wherein R is hydrogen or loweralkyl and X is the anion of a strong mineral acid and the equivalent ratio of HX to quinuclidine nitrogen is about 1 1 with an aminobenzoic acid derivative having the formula wherein wherein R, R¹, R² Step 2, diluting the mixture prepared in step 1, if necessary, with water to dissolve any precipitated said benzamide acid addition salt, separating by product N,N dialkylurea to give a pyridine water solution of said benzamide acid addition salt and removing pyridine, preferably at reduced pressure as a pyridine water azeotrope, adding water, if necessary, during azeotroping and separating a small amount of N,N dialkylurea to give a water solution of said benzamide acid addition salt. Step 3, adding a strong base to the water solution prepared in step 2 to neutralize the acid addition salt, cooling to enhance crystallization, filtering, washing, and drying the crystals to obtain the free base of said 2 alkoxy N 1 azabicyclo 2.2.2 octan 3 yl aminobenzamide having the formula wherein R, R¹, R² and Am are as defined above, and which may have water associated therewith. The following description is applicable to the foregoing process. In step 1, the monoprotonated 3 aminoquinuclidine or derivative thereof strong acid addition salt in aqueous solution is most conveniently derived from a diprotonated strong mineral acid addition salt, preferably the dihydrochloride salt, by dissolving the diprotonated salt in water and adding about one equivalent of a strong base in an aqueous solution, preferably sodium hydroxide solution. The 2 methoxy aminobenzoic acid derivative is preferably dissolved in the pyridine required for the reaction and the solution obtained is mixed together with the foregoing aqueous solution to obtain a third solution. The foregoing reactants, i.e., compounds of Formula II and Formula III, should be present in the range of 10 30 wt. of the total solution at this point molar equivalent weights are approximately equal so that each will be present in the range of about 5 15 wt. and the pyridine and water should be kept within a ratio range of 50 90 vol. pyridine to 50 10 vol. water, preferably about 75 85 vol. pyridine to 15 25 water. N,N Dialkylcarbodiimide, e.g., DCC, is added to the solution and the reaction temperature is maintained at 0 50 In step 2, dilution of the pyridine water mixture prepared in step 1 with water accomplishes the following dissolves any undissolved 2 alkoxy N 1 azabicyclo 2.2.2 octan 3 yl aminobenzamide acid addition salt, hydrolyzes any unused condensing agent and aids in precipitation of by product N,N dialkylurea, e.g., N,N dicyclohexylurea, preparatory to filtration to remove the bulk of the dialkylurea. The azeotroping step as stated above removes pyridine which results in further precipitation of dialkylurea and is done preferably at reduced pressure and temperature. In step 3, the water solution prepared in step 2, containing the benzamide acid addition salt, may be neutralized, cooled, and the crystals obtained are filtered off in a conventional manner, e.g. wasing with water until pH of the filtrate is dropped to about 8 9. The crystals may then be dried at temperatures from about 25 100 The following Examples 1 4, 7, 8 and preceding description and charts serve to illustrate the process of the invention.
