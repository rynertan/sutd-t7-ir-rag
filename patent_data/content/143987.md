# Therapeutic compositions endowed with antiviral activity.

## Abstract
New therapeutic compositions endowed with antiviral activity based on acyclovir or a water soluble derivative thereof potentiated by synergism by means of BVDU, or based on BVDU potentiated by synergism by means of acyclovir or a water soluble derivative thereof . The new compositions, which comprise the two active principles acyclovir BVDU in molar ratios of between 50 1 and 1 5, are much more active than the starting compounds, and these can thus be used at considerably reduced therapeutic doses. Said compositions, which are absolutely free from toxicity towards uninfected cells, also have a lesser tendency to favour the emergence of resistant viral strains.

## Description
THERAPEUTIC COMPOSITIONS ENDOWED WITH ANTIVIRAL ACTIVITYThis invention relates to new therapeutic compositions endowed with selective antiviral activity.Up to a few years ago, antiviral chemotherapy had access to only a few antiviral agents, and these possessed low or zero specificity.In recent years, numerous structural analogues of purine and pyrimidine neucleosides have been described, and some of them possess selective antiviral activity towards the herpesviruses, which are responsable for serious infections in man.Among these new compounds, which because of their selective action have represented a considerable advance in the antiviral chemotherapy field, particularly interesting are 9 2 hydroxyethoxymethyl guanine and its water soluble derivatives, of formula EMI1.1 where R is H acyclovir , COCH NH .HCl, COCH CH NH .HCl, COCH CH 22 3 2 22NH .HC1, COCH CH COONa or COCH2N3, 2 2 2 and E 5 2 bromovinyl 2 deoxyuridine BVDU , of formula EMI2.1 Reference will be made hereinafter only to acyclovir for simplicity, but this term is to be understood as also including its watersoluble derivatives.Current knowledge teaches that the selectivity of the antiviral action of acyclovir and BVDU is due to their specific interaction with two enzymes induced by the herpesviruses in the infected cells, namely pyrimidine kinase and DNA polymerase. theNevertheless at the pratical level, two drugs possess different spectra of antiviral activity and different degrees of toxicity.In fact, whereas acyclovir inhibits to an equal extent the multiplication of the type 1 HSV 1 and type 2 HSV 2 herpes simplex viruses, BVDU is effective against HSV 1 but not against HSV 2.In contrast, the latter compound is considerably more active than acyclovir against the varicella zoster, pseudorabies, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis, simian varicella and herpes saimiri viruses.Next, on considering the ratio of the dose capable to inhibit the growth of uninfected cells by 50 and the dose which is effective in inhibiting the viral multiplication by 50 ID , BVDU is found to 50 have a therapeutic index TI which is cosiderably greater than that of acyclovir in all cases except HSV 2 E.

De Clerq 1982 Selective Antiherpes Agents, TIPS Vol. 3 .A further aspect whiciffias to be evaluated in anti viral agents is their capacity for selecting resistant strains.In the specific case of acyclovir and BVDU, it is known that resistant mutants are promptly selected in vitro even following treatment with doses which are 1000 times greater than the respective ID50 doses.This also accurs in vivo, given that resistant herpesviruses are always more frequently isolated from patients being treated with one or the other drug W.H. Burns et al. 1982 Lancet 421 423 D.J. Coster et al. 1979 Br. J. Ophthalmol. Vol. 63 pp. 418 421 C.S. Crumpaker et al. 1982 N. Engl. J. Med. Vol. 306 pp. 343 346 .In conclusion, acyclovir and BVDU are two drugs which can be used with good results in herpetic infections. However, their therapeutic indices are not satisfactory in all cases, and both very easily induce the selection of resistant mutants.The aim of the present invention is to provide new therapeutic compositions made up from acyclovir and BVDU combined in various proportions so as to result either in an antiviral drug possessing the spectrum of acyclovir but an anti viral activity strongly potentiated by synergism because of the presence of BVDU in given proportions, or in a drug possessing the spectrum of BVDU, but having an antiviral activity strongly potentiated by synergism because of the presence of acyclovir in given proportions.The new anti viral compositions according to the invention also have a clinical reliability greater than that of the individual constituents, since they reduce the emergence of resistant mutants.As a matter of fact, the possibility of attaining said objects by means of the combination of selective antivirals, and in particular by the acyclovir BVDU association, has already been examined jR.F. Schinazi et al. 1982 and K.K. Biron et al. 1982 , in The AmericanJournal of Medicine Acyclovir Symposium .From tests carried out by known methods, based on associating all the known antivirals with each other, the conclusion was drawn that the combination of two antivirals drugs can give rise to either additive, indifferent, antagonistic or synergistic effects in a manner whic s absolutely unpredictable because of the still incomplete knowledge of the relative modes of action. In the case of the acyclovir BVDU association, the authors of the known art reached the conclusion that, when acyclovir and BVDU are mixed in any proportion, they always produce an additive effect Schinazi et al. page 45, column 2 Biron et al. page 56 column 2 .Moreover, even though one of the premises offered in support of the therapeutic validity of associating antiviral drugs was the possibility of reducing the emergence of resistant viral strains, in no case was such an occurrence experimentally documentated.What we have now discovered, namely that combinations of acyclovir and BVDU, within a well defined range of proportions, have an antiviral action strongly potentiated with respect to the starting compounds by virtue of synergistic effect, thus constitutes not only a considerable technical progress in the antiviral chemotherapy field, but also an unpredictable overcoming of technical prejudice.The present invention provides pharmaceutical compositions endowed with selective antiviral activity, constituted by acyclovir and BVDU combined in molar ratios of between 50 1 and 1 5.None of the compositions according to the invention has been proved toxic for uninfected cell cultures.Moreover, the new compositions have demonstrated a capacity for selecting resistant mutants which is considerably lower than that determined for the individual starting compounds.The aim and the results attained by the present invention will be more evident from the analysis of some significant experimental results.The mutual synergistic activity of acyclovir and BVDU was evaluated on the herpex simplex virus type 1 ATCC VR 733 , grown in Vero cells ATCC CCL 81 in MEM T 199 containing 2 calf serum.The method used was the plaque reduction test P. Collins et al. 1977 Annals, of the New York Academy of Sciences 284, pp. 49 597.For this purpose, confluent monolayers of Vero cells, seeded in 6 multi well plates diameter 3.5 cm at a concentration of 3 x 10 cells plate, were infected with 150 plaque forming units PFU ofHSV 1 per plate.After an adsorption period of one hour at room temperature and removal of the unadsorbed virus, the monolayers were washed with buffered saline solution and then incubated at 350C, in 5 CO2, inMEM T 199 containing 2 calf serum and 0.75 carboxymethylcellulose, both in the absence and in the presence of the inhibitors. 72 hours later, the infected monolayers were washed three times with saline solution and dyed with a 0.1 methylene blu solution in order to be able to count the number of lysis plaques resulting from the multiplication of the virus.The results are shown in Table 1. The number represent the mean value of three samples, and correspond to the number of plaques obtained in the absence or in the presence of acyclovir and BVDU, used either individually or in association. TABLE 1Acyclovir yM BVDU yM 0 0.8 0.04 0.02 0.01 0 134 81 109 131 141 0.075 111 53 86 88 111 0.15 99 29 69 61 82 0.3 52 10 26 58 54 0.6 8 0 4 2 6 1.2 0 0 1 3 1The above values were then expressed as percentage of the number of plaques obtained in untreated control cultures and plotted, in the ordinate axis, against the logarithm of the concentration used in abscissa .This enabled to determine the concentration of the two drugs alone or in combination which were necessary for reducing the number of viral plaques by 100 it . 100Two methods, namely a graphical method and a mathematical method, were used to evaluate the type of effect obtained with the different combinations of acyclovir and BVDU.The first method consists of plotting on an arithmetic scale the quantities of acyclovir and BVDU, both alone and in the various combinations, which produce a same effect, ie. 100 inhibition of plaque development. If the combinations produce a simply additive effect, the relative ID100 values fall on the straight line joining the ID1oo values for acyclovir and BVDU used individually. If the combinations produce a synergistic effect, the values fall below the line.The mathematical method consists of calculating the FIC fractional inhibitory concentration indices from the following formula ID1oo acyclovir in combination FIC index ID acyclovir alone ID BVDU in combination 100 ID BVDU alone 100If the FIC index is equal to 1, the effect produced by the combination is additive. If it is lower than 1, the effect is synergistic to an extent which is greater the smaller is the value of the FIC index.The results obtained with both these methods are shown in the isobologram of Figure 1.As can be seen, the acyclovir and BVDU concentration necessary to reduce the number of HSV 1 plaques by 100 , when the two drugs are used individually, are 0.75 M and 0.7 WM, respectively. When acyclo vir and BVDU are used in association, in ratios of between 50 1 and 1 5, 100 inhibition of viral development is obtained at concentrations of both drugs, which are much lower than those expected for a simply additive effect. Furthermore, the synergistic effect of the combinations is demonstrated by the fact that all the FIC index values are much lower that 1. Maximum synergism is obtained for acyclovir and BVDU concentrations of between 2 1 and 5 1. Three significant samples from the therapeutic compositions shown in Table 1 were also tested in order to evaluate their capacity to inter fere with the exponential multiplication of uninfected cells. The results are shown in Figure 2. This shows that none of the combinations tested is able to impair the exponential growth of Vero cells exposed to their action for five days. Finally, tests were carried out which aimed at quantifying the appea rance of resistant HSV 1 mutants following treatment with acyclovir and BVDU, used individually or in association. For these tests the two compounds were used in concentrations which were 3.3 times acyclovir and 1.4 times BVDU the ID value, so as to be able to completerly prevent the multiplication of sensitive viruses. For this 5 purpose, 5 x 10 Vero cells, infected with HSV 1 at a multiplicity of 0.3 PFU cell, were seeded on a preformed monolayer of uninfected Vero cells and left to adhere for 4 hours at 350C in T 199 with 2 serum, in the presence of the inhibitors. The liquid culture medium was then removed and replaced with new medium containing the inhibitors and 0.75 carboxymethylcellulose. The number of plaques developed following multiplication of resistant viruses was determined 72 hours later. From the results shown in Table 2 it is apparent that HSV 1 mutants resistant to acyclovir and BVDU pre exist within the virus population in amounts close to 3 and 1 per 1000 sensitive viruses, respectively. However, when one of the two drugs in a concentration much below theID100 is associated with the other used at a concentration able to select resistant mutants , the development of said mutants is drastically reduced.
