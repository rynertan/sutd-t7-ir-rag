## Description
TIRE TREAD GROOVING APPARATUS AND METHOD One general division among pneumatic tires for vehicles can be made between off the road tires and over the road tires. Off the road tires are conventionally used on construction vehicles and the like and methods and apparatus for the retreading, renewing or rebuilding of such tires have been developed as described in our International specification No. W080 01549. The same difficulties and deficiencies which have led to the development of techniques which have replaced mold curing for off the road tires are factors in the retreading, renewing or rebuilding of over the road tires and particularly of truck tires and the like. For reasons generally outlined in those prior disclosures which relate to retreading, renewing and rebuilding without reliance upon mold curing, effort has been directed toward the development of such techniques for truck tires and the like. One example of apparatus and methods which have been so developed is to be found in BarwellUnited States Patent 3,808,076 which describes a method and apparatus for applying tread material in which tread material is extruded under pressure as a tread pattern is formed in the material. While tires retreaded, renewed or rebuilt in accordance with theBarwell disclosure have operated satisfactorily, the range of tread designs which may be achieved by the method and apparatus there disclosed is somewhat restricted and is more restricted than is desirable to users of such tires. Prior to the Barwell disclosure, it has been disclosed that tread designs may be formed in overthe road tires by grooving techniques bearing some similarities to the grooving techniques described in our aforementioned International specification.However, such grooving techniques have been highly reliant upon the manual skill of an individual operator and have, even so, been somewhat restricted in the range of tread patterns which could be readily and economically produced. It is an object of the present invention to retread, renew or rebuild over the road tires by forming a predetermined grooved tread design or pattern in tread rubber applied to the tire through the use of an apparatus and in accordance with a method which provides wide flexibility in tread designs to be formed while accommodating ease of use. The invention consists in apparatus for forming a predetermined grooved tread design in tread rubber applied to a tire, including tire mounting means for supporting a tire for rotation about a predetermined axis, knife means for forming grooves in tread rubber previously applied to the tire, means mounting said knife means for relative movement between said knife means and the tread surface of the tire, and a programmable memory for controlling relative movement between the knife means and the tire mounting means to form grooves in the tread surface of the tire of a selected one of a plurality of different configurations, characterised in that the means mounting the knife means comprises a turret for mounting a plurality of knives of a plurality of configurations for forming a corresponding plurality of configurations of grooves, and drive means operatively connected with and responsive to the programmable memory for moving a selected one of the knives into engagement with the tread surface of a tire and along a predetermined path through tread rubber applied thereto. The invention also consists in a method of forming a grooved tread design in a tire which has had tread rubber applied thereto and which is mounted for rotation about its own axis, including the steps of forming grooves in the tread rubber on the tire by moving a heated knife relative to the tread surface of the tire in accordance with a pattern stored in a programmable memory, characterised by selecting one of a plurality of knives of varying configurations in accordance with a pattern stored in the programmable memory and moving the selected knife into position for engagement with the tread rubber on the tire. The invention enables the formation of a wide range of selected tread design configurations or patterns. To facilitate this, the apparatus may be adapted fully to control relative movement between a selected grooving knife and a tread surface on at least three axes. Also, a plurality of desired patterns may be coded and stored in the programmable memory, with the code including information concerning repetitions of the various portions of the pattern.During processing of a given specific tire, the desired pattern can be reproduced from the coded information and with a high degree of uniformity and repeatability. In order that the present invention may be more readily understood, reference will now be made to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a perspective view of an apparatus embodying the present invention Figure 2 is a perspective view of a portion of the apparatus of Figure 1, illustrating mechanism which controls movement along one specific axis Figure 3 is an elevational view, partially in section, through a portion of the apparatus of Figure 1 and taken generally along one specific axis of tire movement Figure 4 is an elevational view, partly broken away, taken from adirection opposite to the view ofFigure 3 Figure 5 is a plan view, partly broken away, of the apparatus of Figures 1 to 4 Figure 6 is an enlarged elevational view of a knife portion of the apparatus of Figures 1 to 5 Figure 7 is a side elevational view, partially in section, through the knife portion of Figure 6 Figure 8 is an enlarged elevational view of a turret portion of the apparatus of Figures 1 to 5 Figure 9 is an exploded perspective view of portions of the turret apparatus of Figure 8 Figure 10 is an elevational view in section, through a portion of the turret apparatus of Figures 8 and 9 and Figures 11 to 18 are schematic views of an actuation mechanism for the turret apparatus, illustrating a sequence by which all knife positions are accessible. Referring to the drawings, the apparatus of the present invention, generally indicated at 20, includes a tire mounting means for supporting a tire carcass C for rotation about a predetermined axis, herein referred to as the Y axis. As will be described more fully hereinafter, the tire mounting means includes a rotatable shaft 21, appropriate bearings mounting that shaft for rotation abo ut the Y axis, and a stepping motor 22 Figures 3 and 4 . By means of the stepping motor and as described more fully bereinafter, the tire C may be rotated about the Y axis coaxially with the shaft 21 and in incremental steps. For example, one revolution of the tire C might require 500,000 pulses to the stepping motor 22.Other ratios of pulses delivered to the stepping motor 22 and revolutions of the tire may readily be adopted, consistent with the use of a program for developing a tread design as described hereinafter. The apparatus 20 additionally includes knife means for forming grooves in tread rubber previously applied to the tire carcass C. Particularly, the apparatus 20 includes a plurality of knives KO throughK7 having a plurality of configurations. That is, the particular width of an open area defined between the legs of a generally U shaped knife and or the nose contour of the knife may be varied so as to impart characteristic configurations to grooves formed by the respective knives. The knives are mounted in a means which accomplishes relative movement between the knives and the tread surface of the tire. In the particular form shown for the present invention, the knife mounting means comprises a turret generally indicated at 24.The turret 24 stands atop a standard 25 which is mounted upon a base plate 26 which is rotatable about a vertical axis herein referred to as the X axis. Rotation of the base plate 26 is accomplished by a stepping motor 28 driving a lead screw 29 which engages a threaded block 30 Figure 2 which is operatively connected with a rotatable table 31 carrying the base plate 26. The connection of the threaded block 30 with the turntable 31 is, in the form, illustrated, through a pair of projecting rods 32, a pivot block 34 slidable on the rods 32, and a torque block 35 from which the rods 32 project. As will be appreciated, rotation of the screw 29 by the stepping motor 28 will rotate the turntable 31 through predetermined arcuate movement about the X axis. As such movement occurs, one of the knives KO through K7 may traverse the tread rubber adhered to the tire C. By means of similar stepping motors 36, 38 Figures 3 and 1 and screws 39, 40 driven thereby, the tire mounting means including the shaft 21 and the base plate 26 may be moved along supporting ways respectively generally indicated at 41 and 42. Such movement controls the relative position of the tire and any selected one of the knives KO through K7 along an axis herein referred to as the Z axis. Movement along the Z axis governs the depth of any specific groove being formed. Means are provided for positioning the turret 24 in such a manner as to present a selected one knife for use. In particular, the turret positioning means comprises a spur gear 44 Figures 11 through 18 mounted beneath the standard 25 and engaged by a rack 45. The rack 45 is positioned by a series of pneumatic cylinders, identified as 46, 47, 48. By means of controlled actuation of the cylinders, eight different rotational positions for the turret means 24 are achieved. The sequence of actuation and positions is illustrated in Figures 11 through 18. For example, rotational position 0, disposes knife KO for engagement with the tire surface, by movement of pistons within the cylinders 46, 47, 48 toward the right Figure 11 .In order to move knife Kl into the operating position, the turret means 24 is moved to position 2 by shifting the piston of one cylinder 46 leftward Figure 12 .The strokes of the respective cylinders 46, 47, 48 are such that one cylinder 46 has a stroke sufficient to rotate the turret means 24 one operating position. A second cylinder, namely cylinder 47, is sufficient to move the turret means 24 two positions. The third cylinder 48 has a stroke sufficient to move the turret means 24 four positions. By selecting various combinations of the cylinders for shifting leftward, any one of the eight knives may be brought into the operating position for engagement with the tire carcassC. Actuation of the pneumatic cylinders 46, 47, 48 is under the control of suitable solenoid actuated valves 50, 51, 52. The turret means 24 additionally includes provision for rotating the knives KO through K7 and for controlling heating of the knives KO through K7. Atop the standard 25 is a stepping motor 54 which acts vertically to move a control plate 55. The control plate 55 carries a plurality of racks 58, one corresponding to each knive KO through K7. Each of the racks 58 engages a corresponding pinion gear, one of which is shown at 59 in Figure 9. Each pinion gear 59 is coupled to a shaft on which the corresponding knife is mounted, and, upon verticle movement of the control plate 55, rotates the corresponding knife about a corresponding axis T to any desired angle with respect to the tread surface of the tire. Blade heating is controlled in the form illustrated, by a corresponding series of SCR devices 60 through 67.Additionally, a locking cylinder 68 Figure 8 locks the turret means 24 into a selected rotational position so as to assure stability of a knife being used. In operation, a tire into which a grooved tread design is to be formed is mounted upon the tire mounting means of the apparatus in accordance with this invention and a selected one knife, for example knife Kl, is brought into position against the tread rubber which has been app lied to the tire carcass. Knife contact can be determined visually by an operator or through means of an appropriate light source detector sensing arrangement. If not previously done, a specific tread design program is selected from a plurality of patterns stored in a programmable memory. Operation of the apparatus, and the sequence of the method of this invention, are then initiated.Under the control of the pattern stored in the programmable memory, the stepping motors 22, 36, 38, 54 are incremented through particular pulse patterns to move a knife into position for engagement with the tread rubber on the tire and through a particular path of movement for grooving the tread rubber. From time to time, under the control of the pattern stored in the programmable memory, a selected knife may be withdrawn by movement on the various identified X, Y and Z axes, the turret means 24 rotated to bring another knife into position, and the newly selected knife moved into position for engagement with the tread rubber on the tire.The selected knife then in engagement with the surface of the tire may be rotated about the axes of rotation of the knife through operation of the knife rotating stepping motor 54 in order to assure ease of movement of the selected one knife through the tread rubber materials, and is heated by energization of the corresponding SCR device. Control of the method of the present invention, and operation of the apparatus described hereinabove, is accomplished through use of a programmable memory means as briefly mentioned above. Preferably, the programmable memory means takes the form of a microprocessor such as an 8080 mounted in a control housing 70 Figure 4 . The microprocessor present at the apparatus 20 may be supplied with programs for formation of tread designs from a data cassette magnetic tape recording. Programs may be developed for such a data cassette using other computer facilities, with the function of the programmable memory means at the apparatus 20 being that of selecting a specific tread design program from the library provided by the data cassette and then forming a tread design in a tire in accordance with the selected program.As will be appreciated, an operator of the apparatus 20 may identify, by appropriate input switches and the like, the specific program to be selected from the library provided by the data cassette. Once a specific program has been selected and loaded into the programmable memory controlled by the microprocessor, formation of a tread design as indicated above may begin and continue. It is believed likely that persons appropriately skilled in the arts of applying microprocessors will be enabled, by the disclosure given hereinabove, to design programs which would control the operation of the apparatus described in such a manner as to produce a desired tread design. However, as an aid in the design of such programs, a portion of a rib design program used with an operating embodiment of the apparatus described will be reproduced hereinbelow, as follows 5 X 5500 50 RIGHT T 294 50 CCw Rl N 10 K1 H7 R 1 N 15 Z 400 50 IN R1 N 20 X 2800 53 LEFT Y 3491 42 DOWN N 25 X 260 100 LEFT T 196 100 COW z 100 100 OUT N 30 X 1000 100 LEFT Y 1342 74 UP Z 100 100 IN N 35 X 260 100 LEFT T 196 100 CW N 40 X 650 100 LEFT Y 872 74 DOWN Z 650 100 OUT N 45 X 4970 40 RIGHT Y 308 40 DOWN N 50 Z 650 50 IN R 48 N 55 Program listing references to the X, Y and Z axes will be relatively clear. Program references to aT axis refer to the rotational heading of a knife, accomplished through stepping of the stepping motor 54 atop the turret 24. With respect to each stepping motor drive, the program line calls for a specific stepping motor, specifies a distance to be moved by a number of pulses, specifies the velocity at which the movement is to occur, and specifies the direction of movement by a plus or minus. Additional programs indicate the blade to be selected, such as K1 , indicate that the blade is to be heated by an indicator H, specify a number of repetitions of the particular step, such as R48, and call for the next line number, by a reference N. The portion of a program listing here repeated begins the formation of a rib tread design for a truck tire or the like by forming jogged or angled cuts from one side edge portion of the crown surface of a tire.
