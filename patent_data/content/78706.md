## Description
FLUIDIZED BED HEAD EXCHANGER INCORPORATING INDUCED CIRCULATION UTILIZING DIRECTIONAL AND OR DIFFERENTIAL BED FLUIDIZATION BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a fluidized bed heat exchanger and, more particularly, to a heat exchanger in which heat is generated by the combustion of particulate fuel in a fluidized bed. The use of fluidized beds has long been recognized as an attractive way of generating heat.In a normal fluidized bed arrangement, air is passed through a perforated plate, or grid, which supports a bed of particulate material, usually including a mixture of fuel material, such as high sulfur bituminous coal, and an adsorbent material for the sulfur released as a result of the combustion of the coal. As a result of the air passing through the bed, the bed behaves like a boiling liquid which promotes the combustion of the fuel. In addition to enjoying a capability for considerably reducing the amount of sulfur containing gases introduced to the atmosphere, such an arrangement permits relatively high heat transfer rates, substantially uniform bed temperatures, combustion at relatively low temperatures, a reduction in corrosion and boiler fouling and a reduction in boiler size. In the fluidized bed combustion process, the coal and adsorbent are continuously introduced into the bed by suitable feeders, injectors, or the like and the spent coal and adsorbent are discharged from the lower portion of the bed, usually through a gravity drain pipe extending through a wall of the heat exchanger or through a discharge opening formed through the perforated support plate. However, in these type of arrangements, there is only a minimal number of feeders or injectors which are usually mounted through the heat exchanger walls, which results in poor distribution and mixing of the particulate material in the bed and therefore an insufficient residence time and a reduced reaction efficiency.This problem is specially acute in connection with particulate coal of high reactivity, such as lignite, and or relatively fine size particles smaller than 1 8 inch , and or density particles, all of which require good mixing and distribution for maximum efficiency. Conversely, the feed of larger sized coal may leave larger sized ash particles which can be difficult to drain from the bed. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a fluidized bed heat exchanger in which an improved mixing and distribution of the bed material in the bed is achieved in a relatively inexpensive and simple manner. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a fluidized bed heat exchanger of the above type in which the bed material is circulated within the bed in a direction from the inlet to the drain in such a manner as to provide sufficient residence time so that larger particles can react in the bed and thus not pass through the drain. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a fluidized bed heat exchanger of the above type in which circulation of the bed materials is induced by a plurality of fluidization nozzles with directional exhausts oriented to impart momentum to the bed materials to cause circulation in the desired direction and improved draining. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a fluidized bed heat exchanger of the above type in which bed circulation is induced by varying the quantity of fluidizing gas in different areas or zones of the bed to cause higher and lower bed densities to exist in different zones of the bed, thereby inducing a desirable circulation of the bed material. It is still a further object of the present invention to provide a fluidized bed heat exchanger of the above type in which a plurality of fluidization nozzles are provided which direct the fluidization air in a direction so that the particulate materials in the bed move in an irregular path which increases residence time of the larger particles which may otherwise tend to segregate and settle to the grid. Toward the fulfillment of these and other objects, the heat exchanger of the present invention comprises a plurality of nozzles respectively associated with the perforations in a perforated plate which supports a bed of particulate material. The nozzles are oriented toward the bed drain to induce circulation of the bed material within the bed in a manner to insure an optimum distribution and mixing of the materials, as well as promote drainage of large size ash particles which may tend to segregate to the bottom of the bed. DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The above brief description, as well as further objects, features and advantages of the present invention will be more fully appreciated by reference to the following detailed description of the presently preferred but nonetheless illustrative embodiment in accordance with the present invention when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which Fig. 1 is a vertical sectional view of an embodiment of the fluidized bed heat exchanger of the present invention Fig. 2 is a reduced plan view depicting the heat exchanger of Fig. 1 with the bed material omitted in the interest of clarity Fig. 3 is a view similar to Fig. 1 but depicting another embodiment of the fluidized bed heat exchanger of the present invention Fig. 4 is a view similar to Fig. 2 but depicting the heat exchanger of Fig. 3t Fig. 5 is a view similar to Fig. 1 but depicting another embodiment of the fluidized bed heat exchanger of the present invention Fig. 6 is a view similar to Fig. 1 but depicting still another embodiment of the fluidized bed heat exchanger of the present invention and Fig. 7 is a view similar to Fig. 2 but depicting the heat exchanger of Fig. 6. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT Referring to Figs. 1 and 2 of the drawings, the reference numeral 10 refers in general to an enclosure forming a major portion of a fluidized bed heat exchanger which may be in the form of a boiler, a combustor, a process reactor or any similar type device. The enclosure 10 consists of a front wall 12, a rear wall 14, and two sidewalls 16 and 17 respectively. According to the exemplary embodiment shown, each wall is formed by a plurality of vertically extending tubes 18 disposed in a spaced, parallel relationship and connected together by a plurality of elongated fins 20 extending for the entire lengths of the tubes and connected to diametrically opposed surfaces of the tubes in a conventional manner.The upper portion of the enclosure 10 is not shown for the convenience of presentation, it being understood that it consists of a convection section, a roof and an outlet for allowing the combustion gases to discharge, also in a conventional manner. A bed of particulate material, shown in general ty the reference numberal 22 is disposed within the enclosure 10 and rests on a perforated plate 24 extending horizontally in the lower portion of the enclosure. The bed 22 can consist of a mixture of discrete particles of fuel material such as bituminous coal, and an adsorbent, such as limestone, for adsorbing the sulfur released by the combustion of the fuel material. An air plenum 26 is provided immediately below the plate 24 and an inlet 28 is provided through the plenum for distributing pressurized air from an external source not shown to the plenum under the control of a pair of dampers 30. An overbed feeder 32 extends through the front wall 12, receives particulate coal from inlet ducts or the like not shown , and is adapted to feed the coal particles onto the upper surface of the bed 22. The feeder 32 can operate by gravity discharge or can be in the form of a spreader type feeder or any other similar device. It is understood that a feeder can also be provided for discharging an adsorbent onto the bed 22, and would be constructed and arranged in a manner similar to the feeder 32. A drain pipe 34 extends through the wall 14 and has an inlet end portion 34a that registers with the interior of the enclosure 10 in communication with the lower portion of the bed 22. The pipe 34 is thus adapted to receive the spent bed material and functions to discharge the material from the enclosure 10 by gravity to a screw cooler, conveyor belt, or the like not shown . A plurality of air distributors, or nozzles 36 communicate with the perforations of the plate 24 and each nozzle includes a vertically disposed tubular member that is secured to the plate in any conventional manner, such as by bolting or welding.The vertical portions of the nozzles 36 extend upwardly from the plate 24 for a predetermined distance into the bed 22 and their lower ends receive air from the plenum 26. Each nozzle 36 is bent at approximately a ninety degree angle to form a horizontally extending portion which is oriented in a manner to be described in detail later. As a result of the foregoing, the air from the plenum 26 enters the vertical portions of the nozzles 36 and discharges from the horizontal portions into the bed 22. In addition r the pitch of or number of nozzles per unit of bed area can be varied to cause zones of different bed density to achieve a desirable circulation.Similarly, the nozzle type or size, at constant pitch, can be varied to vary the air or gas flow. Similarly, at constant Pitch, air flow, regulated by external dampers and plenum division plate can be varied in different zones of the bed. Since the air ultimately rises by convection in the enclosure 10 and discharges, along with the gaseous products of combustion, from an outlet not shown in the upper portion of the enclosure, the bed material extending above the horizontal nozzle portions is fluidized.Also, a dormant layer of particulate material is formed around the vertical portions of the nozzles 36 which acts to insulate the plate 24 from the heat generated in the heat exchanger extending above nozzles 36. As shown in Figs. 1 and 2, a large majority of the nozzles 36 are oriented so that their horizontal discharge portions are directed towards the drain pipe 34 in general, and toward the rear wall 14 in particular, while a portion of the nozzles 36 two rows in the example shown adjacent the wall 14 are oriented so that their horizontal portions extend perpendicular to the horizontal portions of the other nozzles and directly towards the drain pipe 34. As a result of this orientation, a momentum is imparted to the bed material which induces a circulation of the material in the direction indicated by dashed flow arrows in Fig. 1 to insure superior distribution, mixing and draining of the particulate material. A bed light off burner 38 is provided through the front wall 12 immediately above the plate 24 for initially lighting off the bed during startup in a conventional manner. A pair of horizontal headers 40 are connected in fluid communication with the tubes 18 forming the front wall 12 and the rear wall 14, respectively, and another horizontal header 42 is connected in fluid communication with the tubes 18 forming the sidewalls 16. It is understood that headers similar to the headers 40 and 42 are provided in communication with both ends of the sidewall 17 and the upper ends of the walls 12, 14 and 16. As a result, a fluid to be heated can be sequentially or simultaneously passed through the walls 12, 14, 16 and 17 to pick up the heat from the fluidized bed in a conventional manner. In operation, the dampers 30 associated with the air plenum 26 are opened and pressurized air passes up through the plenum and into the inlet ends of the nozzles 36. The air flows upwardly through the vertical portions of the nozzles 36 before passing through the horizontal portions and discharging into the bed 22 at a plane above the plane of the plate 24.The air then passes through the bed 22 in a generally upwardly direction towards the drain pipe 34. Thus, that portion of the particulate material in the bed 22 extending immediately above the nozzles 36 is fluidized in a manner to induce a circulation of the particulate material in the bed feeder 32 towards the drain pipe 34, while the portion extending between the latter ends and the upper surface of the plate 24 remains dormant, or stagnant. The light off burner 38 is then fired to heat the material in the bed until the temperature of the material reaches a predetermined level, and additional particulate fuel is discharged from the feeder 32 while adsorbent material is discharged onto the upper surface of the bed 22 as needed. After the bed 22 has been fluidized and has reached a predetermined elevated temperature in accordance with the foregoing, the light off burner 38 is turned off while the feeder 32 continues to distribute particulate fuel to the upper surface of the bed in accordance with predetermined feed rates.As a result of the foregoing, an improved mixing and distribution of the particulate material is achieved due to the momentum imparted to the bed material and the improved circulation of the latter within the bed.Also, the dormant layer of particulate material extending between the upper surface of the plate 24 and the horizonal portions of the nozzles 36 acts as an insulator for the plate 24. Fluid, such as water, to be heated is passed into the headers 40 and 42 where it passes simultaneously, or in sequence, through the tubes 18 forming the walls 12, 14, 16 and 17 to add heat from the fluidized bed to the fluid before it is passed to external apparatus for further processing. The embodiment of Figs. 3 and 4 is similar to that of the embodiment of Figs. 1 and 2, and identical components have been given the same reference numerals. According to the embodiment of Figs. 3 and 4, a centrally located drain pipe 50 extends through the air plenum 26 and has an inlet end portion 50a that extends through, and projects slightly upwardly from, an enlarged opening formed in the plate 24. As can be better appreciated from Fig. 4, the drain pipe 50 is disposed midway between the walls 12 and 14 and midway between the walls 16 and 17, and thus in the central portion of the plate 24. Four feeders 32 are provided for discharging coal particles onto the upper surface of the bed 22, with two feeders extending through the front wall 12 and two extending through the rear wall 14. According to this embodiment, the nozzles 36, which are identical in construction to the nozzles of the previous embodiment, are oriented in a general direction towards the centrally located drain pipe 50.More particularly, the nozzles 36 extending between the front wall 12 and the drain pipe 36 are oriented to discharge the air in a general left to right direction as viewed in Figs 3 and 4 while the nozzles extending between the rear wall 14 and the drain pipe 50 are oriented to discharge the air in a general right to lebft direction.Also, a portion of the nozzles 36. extending in three rows and between the side wall 16 and the drain pipe 50 are oriented in a directjoii perpendicular to the remaining nozzles and directl tov.ards the drain pipe 50. Similarly, the remaining nozzles in these three rows and disposed between the sidewall. 17 and the drain pipe 50 are also oriented in a perpendicular direction and towards the drain pipe 50. Therefore, atrording to this embodiment, an improved mixing and distribution of the particulate material is also achieved as a result of the momentum imparted to the material and the improved circulation of the material within the bed. Referring to the embodiment of Fig. 5, the reference numeral 110 refers in general to an enclosure forming a major portion of a fluidized bed heat exchanger which may be in the form of a boiler, a combustor, a process reactor of any similar type device. The enclosure 110 consists of a front wall 112, a rear wall 114, and two sidewalls 116, one of which is shown in Fig. 5. According to the exemplary embodiment shown, each wall is formed by a plurality of vertically extending tubes 118 disposed in a spaced, parallel relationship and connected together by a plurality of elongated fins 120 extending for the entire lengths of the tubes and connected to diametrically opposed surfaces of the tubes in a conventional manner.The upper portion of the enclosure 110 is not shown for the convenience of presentation, it being understood that it consists of a convection section, a roof and an outlet for allowing the combustion gases to discharge, also in a conventional manner. A bed of particulate material, shown in general by the reference numeral 122 is disposed within the enclosure 110 and rests on a perforated plate 124 extending horizontally in the lower portion of the enclosure. The bed 122 can consist of a mixture of discrete particles of fuel material such as bituminous coal, and an adsorbent, such as limestone, for adsorbing the sulfur released by the combustion of the fuel material. An air plenum 126 is provided immediately below the plate 24 and an inlet 128 is provided through the plenum for distributing pressurized air from an external source. Two partitions 13Q and 132 are provided in the plenum 126 and divide the plenum into three sections 134, 136 and 138. A pair of dampers 140 are adjustably mounted in the plenum section 134 and a pair of dampers 142 are adjustably mounted in the plenum section 136. The dampers 140 and 142 are of a conventional design and function to vary the flow rate of air in terms of pounds per hour, or the like through the plenum sections 134 and 136 respectively, with the dampers being set so that the flow rate through the section 136 is less than that through the section 138 and greater than that through the section 134, for reasons that will be explained in detail later. An overbed feeder 144 extends through the front wall 112, receives particulate coal from inlet ducts or the like not shown , and is adapted to feed the coal particles onto then upper surface of the bed 122. The feeder 144 can operate by gravity discharge or can be in the form of a spreader type feeder or any other similar device. It is understood that a feeder can also be provided for discharging an adsorbent onto the bed 122, and would be constructed and arranged in a manner similar to the feeder 144. A drain pipe 146 extends through the wall 114 and has an inlet end portion 146a that registers with the interior of the enclosure 110 in communication with the lower portion of the bed 122. The pipe 146 is thus adapted to receive the spent bed material as it migrates downwardly in the bed and functions to discharge the material from the enclosure 110 by gravity to a screw cooler, conveyor belt, or the like not shown . A plurality of air distributors, or nozzles 150 communicate with the perforations through the plate 124, respectively, with each nozzle being in the form of a vertically disposed tubular member which is secured to the plate in any conventional manner, such as by bolting or welding, and which extends upwardly from the plate 124 for a predetermined distance into the bed 122. Air from the plenum 126 thus enters the lower end portions of the nozzles 150 and discharges, along with the gaseous products of combustion, from an outlet not shown in the upper portion of the enclosure. The bed material extending above the nozzles is fluidized by the air as it takes part in combustion of fuel from the feeder 144.Also, a dormant layer of particulate material is formed around the vertical portions of the nozzles 150 which acts to insulate the plate 124 from the heat generated in the heat exchanger extending above the nozzles. The nozzles 150 are evenly spaced across the plate 124 with the nozzles of each row being offset from the nozzles of an adjacent row. The flow rate of air from the plenum 126 to the nozzles 150 is varied by selectively controlling the position of the dampers 140 and 142 and, therefore, the flow rate through the plenum sections 134 and 136 respectively. More particularly, the dampers 134 and 136 are normally positioned approximately as shown in Fig. 5 with the flow rate through the section 134 being less than that through the section 136. Since the flow rate through the section 136, in turn, is less than that through the section 138 which has no dampers , it can be appreciated that the flow rate of air passing through the nozzles 150 and into the bed 122 increases in a direction from left to right, as viewed in Fig. 1, or in a direction from the feeder 144 to the drain pipe 146. This induces a circulation of the bed material in a direction from the feeder 144 to the drain pipe 146 and thus insures superior distribution and mixing of the particulate material, as will be explained in greater detail later. A bed light off burner 152 is provided through the front wall 112 immediately above the plate 124 for initially lighting off the bed during startup in a conventional manner. A pair of horizontal headers 154 are connected in fluid communication with the tubes 118 forming the front wall 112 and the rear wall 114, respectively, and another pair of horizontal headers 156 are connected in fluid communication with the tubes 118 forming the sidewalls 116. It is understood that headers similar to the headers 154 and 156 are provided in communication with the upper ends of the walls 112, 114 and 116. As a result, a fluid to be heated can be sequentially or simultaneously passed through the walls 112, 113 and 116 to pick up the heat from the fluidized bed in a conventional manner. In operation, pressurized air is introduced into the plenum inlet 128 and passes up through the plenum 126 and into the plenum sections 134, 136 and 138. The air flows upwardly through the plenum sections 134, 136 and 138 and into the nozzles 150 with the flow rate through the sections 134 and 136 being under control of the dampers 140 and 142, respectively. The air then passes through the nozzles 150 and discharges into the bed 122 at a plane above the plate of the plate 124. The dampers 140 and 142 are adjusted to the approximate relative positions shown so that the flow rate of air through the plenum section 134 is less than that through the section 136. Since there are no dampers in the section 138, it can be appreciated that the flow rate of the air introduced into the bed 122 increases, and the density of the bed particles decreases, in a direction from the front wall 112, where the feeder 144 is located to the rear wall 114, where the drain pipe 146 is located. As a result of this variation in density of the bed material across the bed, that portion of the particulate material in the bed 122 extending immediately above the nozzles 150 in the lower bed portion is fluidized in a manner to induce a circulation of the bed material from the feeder 144 towards the drain pipe 146, while the particulate material in the upper bed portion tends to circulate in an opposite direction as shown by the dashed flow arrow in Fig. 1. The light off burner 152 is then fired to heat the material in the bed until the temperature of the material reaches a predetermined level, and additional particulate fuel and adsorbent material are discharged onto the upper surface of the bed 122 as needed. After the bed 122 has been fluidized and has reached a predetermined elevated temperature in accordance with the foregoing, the light off burner 152 is turned off while the feeder 144 continues to distribute particulate fuel to the upper surface of the bed in accordance with the predetermined feed rates. As a result of the foregoing, and especially the introduction of the fluidizing air into the bed at varying flow rates to vary the density of the bed, a superior mixing and distribution of the particulate material is achieved due to the momentum imparted to the bed material and the improved circulation of the latter within the bed. This increases the residence time of the particulate materials and thus considerably improves the reaction efficiency.Also, the layer of particulate material extending between the upper surface of the plate 124 and the upper ends of the nozzles 150 is relatively dormant and thus acts as an insulator for the plate 124. Fluid, such as water, to be heated is passed into the headers 154 and 156 where it passes simultaneously, or in sequence, through the tubes 118 forming the walls 112, 114 and 116 to add heat from the fluidized bed to the fluid before it is passed to external apparatus for further processing. The embodiment of Figs. 6 and 7 is similar to that of the embodiment of Fig. 5 and identical components have been given the same reference numerals. According to the embodiment of Figs. 6 and 7, the partitions and the dampers have been eliminated and the spacing of the perforations through the plate 124 and the resultant spacing of the nozzles 150 have been changed. More particularly, the spacing between the perforations and, therefore, between the nozzles 150, decreases in a general left to right direction as viewed in Figs. 6 and 7, i.e., in a direction between the front wall 112, where the feeder 144 is located and the rear wall 114, where the drain pipe 156 is located. Thus, the number of perforations and nozzles 150, and the resultant flow rate of air introduced into the bed 122, increases and the density of the bed decreases in the same direction.Thus, a momentum is imparted to the bed material in a manner similar to that of the previous embodiment, which induces a circulation of the materials in the direction shown by the dashed flow arrow in Fig. 6 and thus insures an improved distribution, mixing and residence time of the particulate material. It is understood that variations in each of the above embodiments can be made without departing from the scope of the invention. For example, the nozzles can take a different configuration from that discussed above, and the number, the specific locations, and the orientation of the nozzles can be varied as long as the above objectives and results are achieved. Also a bank, or series, of heat exchange tubes can be provided in the enclosures for circulating water in a heat exchange relationship with the bed 22 in a conventional manner. Other latitudes of modification, change and substitution is intended in the foregoing disclosure and in some instances some features of the invention will be employed without a corresponding use of other features. Accordingly, it is appropriate that the appended claims be construed broadly and in a manner consistent with the spirit and scope of the invention therein.
