# Electrocautery needle and method of forming it.

## Abstract
A disposable electrocautery needle which may be used either in the bi polar or mono polar mode comprises an elongate inner electrode 12 located within a hollow outer elongate electrode 14 and held in place by means of a hollow insulating element located between them. The needle may be formed by locating the insulating element over the inner electrode, stretching it axially to reduce its diameter, positioning the inner electrode 12 and insulating element within the outer electrode 14 and causing the insulating element to recover to its unstretched configuration, for example by heat in the case of a heat recoverable element, and position in the inner electrode 12 correctly within the outer electrode 14 .
