# Gripping device.

## Abstract
A gripping device 9 on an ipdustrial robot is provided with a plurality of light emitting members 16a, 17a for gener ating a plurality of light beams 16c, 17c that intersect at predetermined angles, and with a plurality of light receiving elements 16b, 17b for receiving the light beams 16c, 17c . When the gripping device 9 moves relative to an object that is to be gripped, the object intercepts the light beams 16c, 17c , on the basis of which the position of the object relative to the gripping device 9 is detected. This permits even an object which is not precisely located at a predetermined position to be gripped accurately by the gripping device 9 following de tection of the object position.
