# Cathode ray tube.

## Abstract
In the inner surface of a faceplate 62 of a cathode ray tube, if the maximum effective dimensions perpendicular to a tube axis Z Z , which correspond to the distances be tween the center of the inner surface and a peripheral portion along the lateral axis Y Y , between the center of the inner surface and a peripheral portion along the lon gitudinal axis X X , and between the center of the inner surface and a corner along the diagonal axis D D , are represented by Ss, Sl and Sd, respectively, and if the ratio between these three values is 3 4 5, then the distances between the inner surface center and those individual points along the tube axis Z Z may be given by ΔD, ΔL and ΔS, respectively, which are limited as follows 0.06 ΔD 0.12, 0.05 ΔL 0.10, 0.04 ΔS 0.80.
