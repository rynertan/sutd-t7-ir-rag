## Description
Fluidic Pump Off Control Devices This invention relates to fluidic pump off control devices, particularly for use in oil wells. Means of closing down the oil pump is required if oil stops flowing into the well in order to avoid unnecessary wear of the parts of the pump and also to avoid the cost of running the pump when no oil is flowing. A typical pumping assembly includes a reciprocable piston member in the well head which is in communication with the discharge line. The reciprocable piston member is raised and lowered by a cable attached to a cable head on a pivotable beam, which is rockable via a connecting rod, by cranking means.The cranking.means is operable through reducing gearing and drivable by a prime mover e.g. a motor. As the pump is raised and lowered, oil is sucked out of the well and discharged through the discharge line. There are conventional control systems located in the discharge line which empty movable floats or valves which move to an extreme or closed position when minimal or no oil is being pumped and in this extreme position cause a switch to disconnect power from the pump so that the pump is closed down until oil begins to flow again in the well e.g. USP 3963374, on which this invention is an improvement. A movable member is prone to medhanical wear and failure, and thus unreliability, and it also suffers from the possibility of contamination by sand and or paraffin which retard the movement of the member. It is an object of this invention to obtain an improved fluidic pump off control device in which the above disadvantages are obviated. According to this invention, I propose a fluidic pump off control device which is for location in the discharge line of a fluid pump and which comprises a housing, which is in communication with the pump discharge line via an inlet passage and which encloses a chamber having an outlet passage spaced apart from the inlet passage, the chamber further housing air sampling means associated with pressure sensing means for actuating the disconnection of power to the pump upon a predetermined pressure level being reached corresponding to a predetermined hquid level in the chamber, and timing means for turning the pump on and or off after a predetermined time in cooperation with the pressure sensing means. Preferably, the pressure sensing means comprises a Reed Switch or a pressure monitoring means, operating on pressure difference or measurement, which may be computerised. I also propose a fluidic pump off control device for location in a fluid pump discharge line, comprising a housing, which is in communication with the pump discharge line via an inlet passage and which encloses a chamber having an outlet passage spaced apart from the inlet passage, the chamber further housing means for detecting or measuring the rate of fluid flow in the chamber whereby upon a predetermined minimum amount of Liquid flowing the pump is shut off, a portion of the bottom of the chamber having means to induce a vortex flow in liquid draining away into the relief line. Other improvements are as follows. The upper end of the inner passage in the chamber may be divided to produce a laminar flow of the fluid into the chamber. This may be achieved with regularly spaced dividing means. Turbulence of the fluid in the chamber is minimised in this way. A relief line may be employed in the bottom of the housing so that 4uid remaining in the chamber after the pump has stopped may be drained away. The bottom of the housing proximate and around the orifice of the relief line may be in the form of a trough, which is preferably conical, to produce a vortex flow in the draining liquid so as to prevent particulates, such as sand, from passing into and clogging up the relief line. Dividing means may be disposed in the bottom of the chamber or in the orifice for regulating the outlet flow through the relief line. The mouth of the air sampling means e.g. in the form of a tube may be slanted, which will minimise the effect of turbulence in the chamber on sampled air or gas in the sampling means. The proposed means for reducing turbulence removes the need for means for shielding thetsampling means within the chamber. An embodiment of the invention is described by way of example only with reference to the drawing, in which Figure 1 is a diagrammatic side view of a fluidic pump off control device according to this invention and Figure 2 is a section taken through line A A on Figure 1. A fluidic pump off control device 1 is secured in a fluid delivery line and has a housing 2 with an inlet 3 and an outlet 4. Typically the device would be about 20 high and about 10 in diameter. The housing has a generally cylindrical vessel 5 and a top cover 6 is secured to the vessel via an O ring to provide a seal. A measurement chamber 7 is defined within the housing. The inlet and outlet lines are generally L shaped passages, typically 2i in diameter and have a vertical portion extending upwardly in the housing 2 with the horizontal portion of the inlet line in communication with the delivery line from the pump and the horizontal portion of the outlet line oriented away from and at right angles to the housing 2. The upper end of the inlet passage in the chamber is divided, for instance so as to provide a step wise exit from the passage into the chamber. This has the effect of producing a laminar flow of fluid into the chamber, so reducing possible turbulence in the fluid in the chamber. A tube 8 is disposed in the chamber between the inlet and outlet passages. The tube may be Âµ in diameter and it may have an opening 9 sloping at e.g. 450. Liquid may rise up or down the tube and the resulting air or gas pressure in the tube is detected by any suitable means, for example by a Reed switch carried on the cover or pressure measurement means which are both employed to disconnect the pump. As the level of Liquid decreases in the chamber 7 the pressure within the tube is decreased and similarly for an increased liquid level. Monitoring means may be employed to the pressure measured in the tube 8 in order to determine the liquid level within the chamber 7. The monitoring means is connected with a switching device for turning off the pump. A relief drain line 10 of typical diameter i is connected between the bottom of the housing 2 and the outlet passage The relief liners for removing fluid from the chamber 7 when the pump is out of action.The drain line 10 may be connected to a conical trough 11 in the bottom wall of the housing 2. The trough 11 has walls inclined e.g. at 450, to the relief outlet 12. When excess fluid is draining out through the relief line, a vortex flow is produced which allows the fluid to pass unobstructed through the relief line and foreign matter such as solid particulates, e.g. sand, and paraffin included in raw oil are prevented from passing into the relief line and from clogging up the line. A needle valve may be optionally employed in the relief line to open or close it. Alternatively, the relief line may be made with a sufficiently large diameter to allow the foreign matter in the fluid to pass straight through the relief line. Furthermore, the relief line need not include a right angle bend in Figure 1 between the bottom of the housing and the discharge line. The relief line may be a straight pipe inclined with its outlet lower than its inlet therebetween or a pipe with a gradually curved bend. When the pump is not pumping liquid into the inlet passage, the Liquid level in the chamber 7 of the contrd device is at a lower, non existent level. In this condition the pressure in the chamber and the tube 9 is lowered relatively to when Iquid is being pumped and the pressure detector and optionally monitoring means causes the pump to shut down. A timing mechanism is associated with the pump so that pumping is restored after a predetermined time For instance once no fluid is being pumped, the pump may be turned off after a predetermined period of time e.g. I0.minutes and if Squid becomes available for pumping, then the pump will remain in operation until Liquid is not available. When no more Liquid becomes available within the predetermined time interval during which the pump is kept running, the pump is shut down for a predetermined time. Any desired timing control may be incorporated with the control device according to this invention. When fluid is available it is sucked upwards and flows into the discharge line and then the inlet passage. As pumping continues, the fluid level in the chamber rises until fluid is able to pass out of the outlet passage. A syphon effect is set up and fluid is delivered usually for storage. If gas is being pumped instead of liquid, the gas will pass into the chamber of the control device and rise to the top of the chamber. Any liquid in the chamber will be depressed and flow out of the relief line. As a result, the sampled air pressure in the tube is reduced and if the predetermined low value is reached, pumping is stopped in the usual manner. The features of the fluidic pump off control device herein proposed are useful for the pumping of all liquids, particularly oil.
