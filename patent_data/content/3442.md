# Heat absorbing panel.

## Abstract
A building panel, such as a wall or ceiling tile, is provided which is capable of absorbing heat at normal room temperatures and radiating the absorbed heat on cooling. The panel comprises an outer casing 12, 14 having at least one thin, generally planar cavity 16 which contains a phase change material 42 , such as aqueous Glauber salts, which undergoes a phase change within the range of normal room temperatures. The thickness of the cavity is normally less than 6.5 mms so as to avoid separation of constituents of the phase change material over several hundred phase change cycles.
