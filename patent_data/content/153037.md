# Magnetic head.

## Abstract
A perpendicular magnetic head includes a main pole 11a suitable for use exclusively in recording information signals which is made of a soft magnetic film having a high saturation magnetization and another main pole 11b suitable for use exclusively in reproducing recorded signals which is made of a soft magnetic film having a high initial permeability. The two main poles are disposed at separate positions and can be ren dered operative selectively, e.g., by turning a support 10 through 180 . When an auxiliary pole 14 with a winding 13 is provided, the magnetic tape 2 passes between the selected main pole 11a or 11b and the auxiliary pole 14 .
