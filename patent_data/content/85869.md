# INK FOR SELECTIVE INK JET PRINTING

## Abstract
The ink is of the type essentially consisting of an aqueous solution of a dye, a humectant of glycol type, an anti mold preservative and a pH regulator. In the proposed ink, the humectant is a polyglycol, preferably polyethylene glycol of mol.wt. of about 200, in amount not exceeding 3 wt. . The pH regulator is an organic base, particularly monoethanolamine, or the hydroxide or carbonate of an alkali metal. The dye is a direct dye. The ink has a low viscosity and high surface tension. The printed marks are clear cut and quick drying. Clogging of the jet nozzle is avoided for a long period of inactivity.
