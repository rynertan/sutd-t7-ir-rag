## Description
SOLAR ENERGY CONVERTERS AND ABSORBERS THEREFOR This invention relates to improvements in or relating to solar energy converters, and in particular concerns an absorber for solar energy converters having an internal chamber through which a heat exchange fluid may be passed. It has been known for many years that the sun provides an enormous amount of energy in the form of visible and invisible radiation to the earth s surface, and that this energy may be converted into other forms of enery such as heat and electricity. In recent years the increased cost of conventional fuels has resulted in great interest in the utilization of the sun s energy for commercial and domestic purposes. Photoelectric devices may be used to convert light energy directly into electrical energy, but such devices are expensive. Moreover for many applications it is more convenient to convert the sun s energy into heat energy. A simple form of apparatus for effecting the conversion to heat energy comprises a flat plate arranged to absorb solar radiation so that the plate is heated. By contacting the plate with a heat exchanger this heat may be put to use.However, this type of arrangement is highly inefficient in transferring energy to the heat exchanger as the plate also tends to re radiate energy as its temperature rises. A more sophisticated device for utilizing the sun s energy comprises a reflector which collects and focuses solar radiation onto an element which absorbs the radiation and is thus heated. By contacting the heated element directly or indirectly with a heat exchange fluid the heat may be extracted and then utilized in a variety of ways. Devices of this type are known as solar energy converters and the element which absorbs the focussed radiation is referred to herein as the absorber . The reflector of a solar energy converter is usually a concavely curved mirror with either a circular or parabolic curvature, and the absorber is arranged at the focus of the mirror. A convenient arrangement is to employ a mirror concavely curved in one direction only, and thus generally part cylindrical in shape, which focuses the sun s rays to a focal line parallel to the mirror surface.The absorber is then located along this focal line. Typically the absorbers are in the form of tubes through which a heat transfer fluid is passed. We have found that known forms of solar energy converter are inefficient, extracting only a small proportion of the available energy from the sun s radiation. This inefficiency is due to inefficiency of the absorbers used and at least in part results from radiated heat loss from the absorber. This invention is concerned with various new aspects of solar energy converters which it is believed may overcome some of the disadvantages of known converters, and particularly with a new form of absorber which is intended to be more efficient in absorbing solar energy and transferring this, in the form of heat, to a heat exchange fluid. In one aspect this invention provides an absorber for solar energy converters having an internal chamber through which a heat exchange fluid may be passed, in which the volume of the chamber is minimised by forming the absorber with a convexly curved wall and a concavely curved wall which are joined to define an internal chamber having a generally crescent shaped cross section. The convex outer surface of the convexly curved wall is intended to receive solar radiation forcussed onto it by the reflector, and the absorber should therefore be mounted within the solar energy converter so that this surface is directed towards the reflector. A convexly curved receiving surface means that the amount of energy absorbed can be maximised. By forming the internal chamber as a crescentshaped envelope the volume of heat transfer fluid within the absorber is decreased, which results in greater efficiency and sensitivity. The shape of the absorber is to a certain extent dictated by the reflector system employed in the solar energy converter. When a reflector curved in one direction is employed as indicated above the absorber is conveniently a tube. According to the invention in such applications the absorber preferably comprises an elongate tubular member having a generally crescent shaped cross section. The tubular member thus comprises a transversely convexly curved outer wall and a transversely concavelycurved inner wall, with the two walls being joined along their elongate edges to form a continuous tube. The convex face of the outer wall is intended to be the radiationreceiving surface of the absorber. It has been established that for the absorber to absorb the maximum amount of heat from the radiation focussed by the reflector, the focussed rays should strike the absorber substantially perpendicularly to its surface, and thus the optimum shape for the outer wall of the absorber is determined by the shape of mirror used.When a parabolically curved mirror is employed, the convex curvature of the outer wall of the tubular member is very preferably also parabolically curved to a shape geometrically similar to that of the mirror. However, for ease of manufacture the curvature of the outer wall may be made partcircular without undue loss of efficiency even with a parabolic mirror. When the reflector is curved in more than one direction other overall shapes of absorber are preferably employed.Thus, when the reflector is a spherically or parabolicallycurved dish , the absorber is conveniently also formed in the shape of a corresponding dish . A dished absorber may be formed from one or more tubular members having a crescentshaped cross section for example, by forming one such tubular member into a helix so that the outer wall presents a generally convex face to the reflector. Alternatively the absorber may comprise a generally circular, convexlydished outer wall and a generally circular, concavelydished inner wall joined at their edges to define a circular chamber having crescent shaped cross sections through its axis, there being means of passing heat exchange fluid into and out of the chamber. The convexly curved wall of the absorber is preferably adapted to absorb radiation, and most preferably this wall is provided with a layer or coating to improve its absorptive properties. However, any such coating should not be so thick as to interfere with the transmission of heat to the fluid within the absorber. Suitable absorptive coatings are known in the art, and it is believed to be within the competence of one skilled in the art to select an appropriate coating for the outer wall. By way of example only it is pointed out that the outer wall of the tubular member may be painted with a matt black paint. The concavely curved wall of the absorber is not intended to receive radiation being directed away from the reflector, and for the most efficient working of a solar energy converter it has been found that it is important to reduce, and if possible eliminate, the tendency of the absorber to radiate heat from its side remote from the reflector. Accordingly, it is a highly preferred feature of this invention that all but the radiation receiving surface of the absorber is provided with thermal insulation. Thus, the concavely curved wall and any portion of the absorber not facing the reflector are preferably thermally insulated. Thermal insulators in themselves are well known, but heretofore the problem of radiation from the absorber in solar energy converters has not been appreciated or has not been effectively prevented. Any good thermal insulator may be used on the absorber, but we have found asbestos or a similar fibrous insulating material such as those containing alumina to be a particularly effective insulating material for this purpose. In an especially preferred embodiment the insulating material is used in the form of one or more strands of rope, but other preformed shapes would be suitable.On large scale absorbers it may be more convenient to apply a non fibrous insulating material. The thickness of the thermal insulation needed depends on the temperature of the absorber when in operation, the size of the absorber and the nature of the insulation used.However, by way of illustration, when using asbestos rope in a small installation with an absorber in the form of an 0 elongate tube and attaining temperatures of from 100 200 C it has been found desirable to employ an asbestos rope of circular cross section sufficiently large to fill the channel defined by the concavely curved inner wall supplemented by two further strands of smaller section asbestos rope to insulate the tubular member along the edges defined by the extremities of the crescent shaped cross section.On larger installations it may not be necessary to fill this channel on a tubular absorber to achieve adequate insulation. The concave curvature of the inner wall of the absorber reduces the cross sectional area of the tubular member. This effect is most important since a reduced cross section means that a smaller volume of heat transfer fluid is needed to fill the tube. A small volume of fluid has a correspondingly smaller heat capacity so that the fluid will be more rapidly heated by radiation falling on the absorber, and at the same time the temperature of the fluid will vary more rapidly with changes in the amount of radiation hitting the absorber so making the converter as a whole more sensitive. This sensitivity enables the converter incorporating the absorber of the invention to employ sophisticated control systems as defined hereinafter.Furthermore, the relatively rapid transit of a small volume of heat transfer fluid along the tubular member discourages laminar flow and the fluid more rapidly reduces the surface temperature of the absorber this in turn reduces the tendency of the absorber to act as a radiator. It is therefore a feature of the absorber of the invention that the internal chamber is a narrow conduit defined between the outer and inner walls through which heat transfer fluid is passed. To reduce the volume of the internal chamber as much as possible, it is desirable for the curvature of two walls to be geometrically similar, so that the conduit defined by these surfaces is of substantially constant thickness. When the absorber is in the form of a tubular member this may be formed by simple extrusion techniques, or alternatively it may be formed by pressing an appropriately dimensioned tube to form the member with a generally crescent shaped crosssection. As explained above a dished absorber may be formed from such tubular member, or pre fabricated from two dished walls. The absorber must be of sufficient strength so that it can be readily supported within the solar energy converter even when it contains heat transfer fluid at elevated temperatures. The material of which the tubular member is made should also allow heat to pass from its outer surface to the heat transfer fluid, and thus must be a good conductor of heat. The transfer is also enhanced by making the wall thickness of the tubular member as low as possible while preserving the necessary strength. The tubular member must also be resistant to corrosion by the heat transfer fluid at the elevated temperatures to which it is subjected. In general, the tubular member is formed of a metal, and copper, steel and aluminium are particularly suitable for most applications.In high temperature applications, or where the heat transfer fluid is particularly corrosive, titanium, graphite moulding or other substantially inert materials may be used. As described hereinbefore a heat transfer fluid is passed through the absorber, and thus the tubular member is advantageously adapted to be sealingly connected at its one end to a heat transfer fluid input pipe and at its other end to a heat transfer fluid output pipe. The output pipe and input pipe may then be connected to a heat transfer fluid reservoir or to a heat exchanger. The heat transfer fluid used in the absorber is chosen having regard to the function of the solar energy converter and the temperatures to which it is subjected. It may be a liquid or a gas such as steam or water vapour. In most installations the fluid will be a liquid and it may simply be water, although this may contain corrosion inhibitors if necessary. Such inhibitors are well known to those skilled in the art. Other heat exchange fluids such as fluorosubstituted hydrocarbons may be used. When high temperatures are likely to be encountered a higher boiling point liquid such as polyglycol may be employed. In use the absorber is mounted to lie at the focus of the reflector of a solar energy converter. Thus, when the reflector is parabolically curved in one direction the absorber is mounted to lie along the focal line with the convexly curved outer wall directed towards the reflector so that the radiation focussed by the reflector falls substantially perpendicularly onto the outer wall of the absorber. This invention extends to solar energy converters incorporating one or more absorbers of the invention. The reflector may be any appropriately shaped surface capable of reflecting solar radiation, and particularly the infra red portion of this radiation. Obviously the more efficient the reflector the more efficient is the solar energy converter as a whole. Plate glass reflectors may be used, but they are very expensive to manufacture, and polished metal reflectors provide a more economical alternative amongst conventional reflecting surfaces. We have discovered an extremely effective reflecting surface that gives excellent results when employed in solar energy converters is formed by applying a thin layer of aluminium to a supporting sheet. This has the advantages that it is a very effective reflector, is easy and convenient to handle, and is cheap to produce. The supporting sheet is preferably flexible to enable a variety of mirror configurations to be formed, and is most conveniently a sheet of plastics material such as PVC or a melamine formaldehyde resin. The aluminium may be applied to the supporting sheet by sputtering since no substantial thickness is required provided the reflecting surface is completely and sub stantially evenly coated with aluminium. Layers of 0 aluminium only 100A thick may give satisfactory results although to be more robust it may be desirable to make the 0 aluminium layer up to 20 thick. A thickness of from lOOA to 500i, and particularly a thickness of fOO2, is preferred. The thickness of the backing layer is not critical being dependent on the scale of the apparatus but for ease of handling a thickness of from 0.005 to 0.03 inches, and especially 0.01 to 0.02 inches has been found convenient. The thin layer of aluminium may easily be damaged by scratching or oxidation and preferably it is protected with a covering layer. This layer is preferably a thin coating of a plastics material such as a polyester material. Advantageously the layer is from 0.0001 to 0.005 inches thick and most preferably from 0.0001 to 0.001 inches thick. A preferred embodiment uses a covering layer 0.0005 inches thick. The preferred reflectors may be formed into any shape desired for a solar energy converter, and generally is used to form a mirror having the reflecting surface concavelycurved in one direction. However, dished reflectors may also be formed for example, by vacuum forming. The mirror may be of circular curvature especially when the focal length is short but is preferably parabolically curved. It is often advantageous that a reflector curved in one direction is elongate with the concave curvature transverse to the major axis. A mirror of this configuration may be obtained by mounting an appropriately proportioned rectangle of the composite sheet defined hereinbefore upon a concavelycurved face of a rigid reflector shell adapted to hold the composite shape in the desired configuration. The shell may be formed from glass reinforced plastics material or any similar material of appropriate strength. In a preferred embodiment two or more reflectors of the invention are mounted within reflector shells attached to a suitable frame. The reflector of this invention is preferably employed with an absorber as defined hereinbefore, since this combination is particularly efficient and transmits a high proportion of the energy of the solar radiation to the absorber.The invention extends to a solar energy converter incorporating one or more reflectors as defined hereinbefore as well as to such converters which further incorporate one or more absorbers of the invention. To realise the full advantages of the reflector and absorber of the invention it is desirable that a solar energy converter incorporating these components be adapted to track the sun and be provided with a control system to effect this tracking. A preferred control system for a solar energy converter follows the path of the sun and is provided with driving means to orient the solar energy converter, the control system comprising a unidirectional photoelectric cell mounted on the solar energy converter and arranged with a masking member positioned in front of the light sensitive portion of the cell so that a light source casts a shadow on the cell only when the solar energy converter is oriented so that the or each reflector thereof receives solar radiation, the cell being electrically connectable to the driving means so that when a shadow is cast on the light sensitive portion of the cell the driving means is immobilized but when no shadow is cast thereon the driving means is actuated to move the solar energy converter until it reaches an orientation when the driving means is immobilized. The solar energy converter may be provided with driving means both to traverse the reflectors and to change their elevation so that they may always be arranged in the optimum position that is, pointed directly at the sun so that the maximum amount of energy is concentrated at their foci. These driving means may be controlled by one or more photoelectric cells as described above. However, it is possible for the elevation of the reflectors to be separately adjustable, In a preferred embodiment the reflectors of the solar energy converter are mounted on a frame rotatable about a vertical axis by driving means actuable by the control system of the invention. The driving means conveniently comprises an electric motor arranged to traverse the reflectors by rotating the frame. A separate driving means may be provided, controlled by a separate control system, to adjust the elevation of the reflectors. The sensitivity of the control system is determined by the size and position of the masking member. The smaller the masking member relative to the light sensitive portion of the cell, the more sensitive the control system, provided always that the masking member is sufficiently large to cast a shadow that will immobilize the driving means when the cell, the masking member and the sun are aligned. Equally, the further the masking member from the light sensitive portion of the cell the more sensitive the control system. Since the sun moves across the sky always in the same direction, the driving means may be arranged to track the sun always in that same direction. However, the control system then is preferably provided with means to return the reflectors to the dawn position at the end of each day.To do this the control system preferably further comprises a second photoelectric cell arranged to detect ambient light conditions, and adapted to return the reflectors to the dawn position when darkness falls. To conserve electricity the control system is preferably arranged to become deactivated until such time as ambient light conditions, as detected by the second photo electric cell indicate that the sun is again rising at dawn on the following day. The elevation of the reflectors needs adjustments during the year to maintain the optimum elevation, and preferably this adjustment is also effected using a control system as described hereinbefore. The control system may also monitor the temperature of the heat transfer fluid so that if it gets too hot the driving means is actuated to move the reflectors out of the radiation receiving position and traverse them forward to await the sun, and thus give a period for the fluid to cool before the radiation is again focussed onto the absorbers. To prevent energy wastage, the control system also preferably monitors and compares the temperature of the heat transfer fluid entering and leaving the absorbers, and is arranged to switch off the pump circulating the fluid when the outlet temperature falls towards the inlet temperature. With this arrangement if the sun is obscured, for example by cloud, the fluid circulation will cease, and no energy will be wasted in pumping unheated fluid through the absorbers. This invention will now be described, though cnly by way of illustration, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 shows a general perspective view of a portion of the tubular member of an absorber of the invention Figure 2 shows a cross section of the tubular member of Figure 1 Figure 3 shows a cross section of a planar portion of a reflector of the invention Figure 4 shows a schematic perspective view of a portion of a parabolic mirror formed from a reflector of the invention with an absorber as shown in Figure 1 posit ioned at the focus Figure 5 shows a schematic perspective view of a solar energy converter incorporating reflectors and absorbers of the invention Figure 6 is a schematic side view of the solar energy converter of Figure 5 and Figure 7 is a block diagram of a control system of the invention. The tubular member 1 shown in Figures 1 and 2 comprises an alongate transversely curved conduit 2 defined by a transversely convexly curved outer surface 3 and a transversely concavely curved inner surface 4 joined along their long edges.The heat transfer fluid flows along the passage 5 and is heated by radiation falling on surface 3. Radiation from surface 4 is reduced by thermal insulation in the form of asbestos rope 6 attached to the surface 4 and two further strands of asbestos rope 6 attached along the long edges of tubular member 1. The reflector 7 shown in Figure 3 comprises a plastics material supporting sheet 8 to which has been applied by sputtering a thin layer of aluminium 9, which is in turn covered and protected by the layer 10. In the arrangement shown in Figure 4 the tubular member 1 lies along the focal line of reflector 7 which has been formed into a parabolic mirror. Figure 5 shows a solar energy converter 11 comprising four solar panels 12 formed by mounting reflectors 7 of the invention in suitably shaped shells 7 which are attached to a frame 13. At the focus of each reflector 7 there is mounted an absorber 14 of the invention comprising a tubular member as shown in Figures 1 and 2. As shown in Figure 6 the frame 13 is located on a base 15 by supports 16. The frame 13 is pivotally mounted on the base and on supports 16 which are adjustable in length by means of the adjuster 17. The adjuster 17 may be either manually operable, or operated by a servo not shown . In summer when the sun is higher, the panels 12 should be at a greater angle to the vertical and supports 16 are shortened. Conversely, in winter the supports 16 are lengthened and the panels 12 are moved to a more vertical elevation. The base 15 is rotatable about a spindle 18 and is turned about the spindle by a motor 19 operating via a chain drive on a wheel 20 attached to the base 15. Support against lateral forces is given by wheels 21 which run on the ground a suitably supported track. The movement of the solar energy converter about the spindle 18 is controlled by the control system shown inFigure 7. Photocell 22 detects general light conditions when these reach a predetermined level at dawn the control system micro processor 23 is activated. Thereafter unidirectional photocell 24, mounted alongside panels 12, controls the motor 19 via the micro processor 23. When the sun casts a shadow of masking member 25 on the lightsensitive portion 26 of photocell 24 the motor 19 is immobilized. When sunlight reaches portion 26 motor 19 is activated and rotates base 15 until the portion 26 is again obscured by the shadow of masking member 25. In this way the panels 12 are kept in proper alignment with the sunlight for maximum efficiency. A similar system may be used to control a servo to operate adjuster 17. When the ambient light fails because of the onset of night, and not from momentary obscuring of the sun by clouds, photocell 22 triggers the micro processor 23 to activate motor 19 so as to return the solar energy converter to a position where it will receive sunlight at dawn the next day. The control system is then deactivated until photocell 22 detects sunlight when dawn arrives. The control system may also incorporate control of the heat transfer fluid system not shown , and may for example include safety devices to move the panels 12 out of alignment with the sun in the event that the absorbers or the heat transfer fluid overheats.
