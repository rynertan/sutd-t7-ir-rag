## Description
DETERGENT COMPOSITIONS Technical Field This invention relates to detergent compositions. In particular, it relates to detergent compositions suitable for washing fabrics, clothes etc in automatic washing machines with improved cleaning performance. Background Cationic surfactants have been frequently incorporated into detergent compositions of various types. However, the inclusion of such cationic surfactants is generally for the purpose of providing some adjunct fabric care benefit, and not for the purpose of cleaning. For example, certain cationic surfactants have been included in detergent compositions for the purpose of yielding a germidical or sanitization benefit to washed surfaces, as is disclosed inU.S. Patent 2,742,434, Kopp, issued April 17, 1956 U.S.Patent 3,539,520, Cantor et al, issued November 10, 1970 andU.S. Patent 3,965,026, Lancz, issued June 22 1976. Other cationic surfactants such as ditallowdimethylammoniujn chloride, have been included in detergent compositions for the purpose of yielding a fabric softening benefit, as disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,607,763, Salmon et al, issuedSeptember 21 1971 and U.S. Patent 3,644,203, Lamberti et al, issued February 22 1972. Such components are also disclosed as being included in detergent compositions for the purpose of controlling static, as well as softening laundered fabrics, in U.S. Patent 3,951,879, Wixon, issued April 20 1976 and U.S. Patent 3,959,157 Inamorato, issued May 25 1976. Certain water soluble cat ionic surfactants are also known to enhance cleaning performance, especially on greasy and oily soils, when used in combination with nonionic or anionic surfactants, see for instance European Patent n aciorl u 22. rtit optiiElUils grease dEter561 ci performance, however, these compositions require relatively high levels of the cat ionic and nonionic surfactant components in relation to the anionic surfactant level and this can result in a lack of robustness , particularly in the areas of clay soil detergency and whiteness maintenance, when the compositions are used in multicycle wash wear treatments in the presence of rinse added cationic fabric softener.Moreover, the compositions have their greatest effectiveness at medium to high wash temperature 500C and above at low wash temperatures up to about 40 C on the other hand, the rate of oil removal is greatly reduced and excessively long wash times are required for optimum performance. The Applicants have now discovered, however, that excellent grease oil and lipid soil removal performance can be secured simultaneously with good clay soil detergency and whiteness maintenance, under realistic multicycle wash wear conditions, including low wash temperatures and carry over of rinse added softener, by using an anionic surfactant together with a low level of an auxiliary surfactant system consisting of a mixture of a water soluble cat ionic surfactant and a semipolar amine oxide surfactant. The addition of amine oxides to detergent compositions is not new of course. Thus U.S. Patents 3,531,526, 4,133,779 and 3,202,714 all relate to detergent compositions employing amine oxides at relatively high levels in a conventional detergent functionality. However, there is apparently no appreciation in the art of the value of low levels of mixed amine oxide cationic surfactant systems in improving low temperature cleaning of greasy, oily and lipid soils under realistic multi cycle wash rinse wear conditions. The invention thus provides granular and liquid detergent compositions suitable for heavy duty laundering purposes having improved cleaning performance especially on greasy, oily and lipid soils without detriment to detergency performance on clay soils and without detriment to the soil suspending or fabric whitening characteristics of the compositions, across the range of wash temperatures and under realistic soil, fabric load and multi wash rinse wear cycle conditions. Summary of the Invention According to the present invention, there is provided a detergent composition having a pH in 1 aqueous dispersion of at least 7 comprising a from 2 to 60 of surfactant selected from anionic surfactants and mixtures thereof with nonionic, zwitterionic and ampholytic surfactants b from 0.5 to 6 of cosurfactant comprising a 5 1 to 1 5 mixture of i amine oxide having the general formula I EMI3.1 wherein R is a linear or branched alkyl or alkenyl group having 8 to 20 carbon atoms, each R1 is independently selected from C 4 alkyl and CnH 2n0 mH where i is an integer from 1 to 6, j is 0 or 1, n is 2 or 3 and m is from 1 to 7, the sum total of CnH 2n0 groups in a molecule being no more than 7, and ii quaternary ammonium surfactant having the general formula II EMI4.1 wherein R2is a linear or branched alkyl, alkenyl or alkaryl group having 8 to 16 carbon atoms and each R3 is independently selected from C14 alkyl, C1 4 alkaryl and CnE2n0 m wherein i.is an integer from 1 to 6, j is 0 or 1, n is 2 or 3 and m is from 1 to 7, the sum total of CnH2n0 groups in a molecule being no more than 7, and wherein Z represents counteranion in number to give electrical neutrality, wherein the weight ratio of surfactant cosurfactant is at least 1 1 and wherein the equivalent ratio of anionic surfactant cationic surfactant is also at least 1 1. Detergent compositions of the invention contain a primary surfactant which is an anionic surfactant or a mixture thereof with nonionic, zwitterionic or ampholytio surfactants, and a cosurfactant which is a mixture of water soluble quaternary ammonium surfactant and amine oxide. The primary surfactant constitutes from 2 to 60 of the detergent compositions, preferably from about 4 to about 25 , especially from about 8 to about 20 in the case of granular detergent composition, and preferably from about 10 to about 50 , especially from about 15 to about 40 in the case of liquid detergent compositions.The auxiliary surfactant system is preferably from about 1 to about 4 of the detergent composition with the amine oxide and quaternary ammonium surfactants being present at a weight ratio of from about 3 1 to about 1 3, with IjC individual cosurfactants each preferably constituting up to about 1.5 by weight of composition. . The weight ratio of surfactant cosurfactant is at least 1 1, preferably from about 2 1 to about 50 1, more preferably from about 3 1 to about 20 1. Importantly, the anionic surfactant component is present at an equivalent ratio with respect to the water soluble quaternary ammonium surfactant of at least 1 1. This is necessary for ensuring optimum grease and lipid soil removal and good suspension of soil in the detergent wash liquor, and for achieving excellent whiteness under multicycle wash rinse wear conditions. Although as discussed above an anionic surfactant is an essential component of the present compositions, preferred compositions contain as the primary surfactant a mixture of anionic and alkoxylated nonionic surfactants in a weight ratio of from about 20 1 to about 1 5, more preferably from about 6 1 to about 1 3, especially from about 5 1 to about 1 1. Such compositons are desirable from the point of view of providing optimum grease, lipid and particulate detergency. Optimum performance also depends sensitively on the choice of nonionic surfactant and especially desirable from the viewpoint of grease detergency are biodegradable nonionic surfactants having a lower consolute temperature in the range from about 25 0C to about 65 0C, more preferably from about 30 C to about 50 C. Highly suitable nonionic surfactants of this type have the general formula. RO CE2CH2O nH wherein R is primary or secondary branched or unbranched 9 15 alkyl or alkenyl and n the average degree of ethoxylation is from 2 to 9, especially from 3 to 8. More hydrophilic nonionic detergents can be employed for providing particulate detergency and anti redeposition, however, for instance, nonionic detergents of the general formula given above wherein R is primary or secondary, branched or unbranched C8 24 alkyl or alkenyl and n is from 10 to 40. Combinations of the two classes of nonionic surfactants can also te used with advantage of COUrse.

Highly preferred exar.,ples of suc carboxylates are 1 1 styrene maleic acid copolymer, di isobutylene maleic acid copolymers and methyl vinyl ether mAleic acid copolymers.Other suitable polycarboxylates are poly hydroxy acrylates and lactones thereof as described inBelgian Patent 817,678 and B.P. 1,425,307. Another suitable component of the present compositions is a water soluble magnesium salt which is added at levels in the range from about 0.015 to about 0.2 , preferably from about 0.03 to about 0.15 and more preferably from about 0,055 to about 0.12 by weight of the compositions based on weight of magnesium . Suitable magnesium salts include magnesium sulfate, magnesium sulfate heptahydrate, magnesium chloride, magnesium chloride hexahydrate, magnesium fluoride and magnesium acetate. Dersirably, the magnesium salt is added to granular compositions as part of the aqueous slurry crutcher mix and is then converted to dry granular form for instance by spray drying. Liquid detergent compositions of the invention can additionally be supplemented by pH regulators such as potassium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, potassium bicarbonate, sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, and mono , di and triethanolamine solvents such as ethyl alcohol, isopropanol, propylene glycol, propane l, 2 diol, hexyleneglycol and hydrotropes such as urea. Granular detergent compositions of the invention are preferably prepared by spray drying an aqueous slurry comprising the primary surfactant, cosurfactant and detergency builder. The aqueous slurry is mixed at a temperature in the range 70 900C and the water content of the slurry adjusted to a range of 25 to 45 , preferably 30t 38z by weight. Spray drying is undertaken with drying gas inlet temperature of from about 250 3500C, preferably 275 3300C providing a final moisture content in the range of from 8 to 14 by weight.Nonionic surfactant, where present, can then be sprayed in fluid form onto the spray dried detergent granules.
