# Method of constructing collimators and or detectors for penetrating radiation.

## Abstract
A method of constructing arrays of collimators and or detectors for penetrating radiation is described. A tape or foil is wound alternatively over and under rods provided in upper and lower sets to define a plurality of substantially parallel or slightly inclined channels for the radiation. The channels can be filled with suitable plastics material.
