## Abstract
An unenergised member 60 moves relative to an extended single phase energised primary coil system 12 and a secondary coil system 11 . The coils of the secondary coil system are in series connected pairs coils 11A, 11G in pair 11 1 interspaced with other pairs coils 11B, 11H in pairs 11 2 as an array of coils along a path x which may be straight, curved, etc. The coils in the pairs, which are balanced to give a zero output, form sequences sequences I, II, III etc each of which are terminated with a phase shift network PC to give an incremental phase shift between sequences. The incremental phase shifted outputs are combined to give a progressive phase shifted output 66 representative of the position of the member 60 . Ambiguity avoidance, when phase shift exceeds 360 DEG , may be arranged by having two secondary coil systems 81A, 81B with the same number of coils but with differing inremental phase shifted outputs so that the utilised progressive phase shifted output is a phase difference.
