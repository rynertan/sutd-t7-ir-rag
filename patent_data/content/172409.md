# HYBRID CIRCUIT BREAKER

## Abstract
A hybrid circuit breaker is formed with a vacuum interrupter SR , a breaking resistor R connected in parallel to the vacuum interrupter SR , an SF6 gas interrupter SX connected in series to the breaking resistor R and a spring mechanism 16 for actuating the vacuum interrupter SR so that a circuit current io to be interrupted is commutated to the breaking resistor R . A plurality of the above hybrid circuit breakers are connected in series in an EHV UHV electric power system, The spring mechanism 16 is pro vided exclusively for the commutation action of the vacuum interrupter SR . The output power from a breaker driver 100 is fully used to circuit open the gas interrupter SX , thereby shortening the maximum current feeding period TQ of the breaking resistor R .
