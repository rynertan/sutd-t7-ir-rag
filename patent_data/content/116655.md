## Description
CONTROL OF COLLIDING ION BEAMSTECHNICAL FIELD This invention relates to a method and system for enhancing the power producing capability of a nuclear fusion reactor and more specifically to methods and structure for enhancing the ion density in a directed particle fusion reactor. BACKGROUND ART In Applicant s prior atomic fusion process two oppositely directed streams of ions are forced to follow the same helical paths in an annular reaction zone for promoting fusion producing collisions between particles of one stream and particles of the other stream. As one of several examples, one stream may comprise deuterium and the other stream, helium 3 ions. The reaction zone comprises an annulus between an inner electrode and an outer coaxial electrode. A radial electric field is established in the annulus to control and maintain the streams in the helical paths. Where two such beams of positively charged particles move in opposite directions along such paths, a high ion density is desired in order to be able to promote collisions sufficient to produce a net power.gain from the system The present invention is directed to the creation of conditions in a reactor such that desired high ion densities are periodically achieved. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION In accordance with the invention, oppositely directed ion beams constrained to helical paths pass through an annular reaction zone. The object is to produce fusion reactions due to collisions between the ion beams. The reaction zone is an annulus as between an inner cylindrical electrode and an outercylindrical coaxial electrode. The beams are enhanced in ion density at spa ced points along the paths by providing spline structures extending the length of the reaction zone and protruding from the walls of the electrodes into the reaction zone. The splines preferably extend along the outer surface of the inner electrode. Splines also may be provided on the inner surface of the outer electrode. This structure causes variations in the electric field along the helical paths followed by the ion beams. Such fields cause the beams to be successively more concentrated and less concentrated as the beams traverse the reaction zone. Points of high concentration are the points at which fusionproducing collisions most likely take place. Variations in the reaction chamber dimensions improves the ratioof energy output to energy input by enhancing the charge density and beam stability and reduces the tendency toward coulomb scattering. Thus there is provided improvement in a fusion reaction system wherein ions from two sources are forced to follow helical paths in opposite senses in a cylindrical reaction zone. Structure on at least one of the boundaries of the reaction zone aid in ion density enhancement. Further, in accordance with the present invention, ion density is further enhanced by modulating the velocity of the ions from the two opposed sources such that waves traveling through the reaction zone in opposite directions create standing waves wherein the wave length corresponds to the distance between points of concentration of the fields due to the presence of the splines. The waves are of such phase tfhat the velocity nodes occur at the points of the high ion density due to the variations in reaction chamber dimensions. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIGURE 1 is a longitudinal sectional view, of a reactor in which the invention is employed FIGURE 2 is a sectional view of a portion of the reactor of FIGURE 1 taken along lines 2 2 of FIGURE 1 and FIGURE 3 is a view of a portion of the inner element defining part of the reaction zone of FIGURE 1 in which compound dimensional variations are provided. DETAILED DESCRIPTION FIGURE 1 FIGURE 1 illustrates two ion sources 16 and 17 which face each other in an evacuated chamber not shown . Ion beams from sources 16 and 17 are accelerated parallel to a common reaction zone axis 35a. The beams each pass through a radial magnetic fields H. The magnetic fields force the ions into spiral paths about axis 35a. Ions from source 16 travel in one direction along spiral paths and ions from source 17 travel in the other direction along spiral paths. The beams are subjected to electrostatic fields which cause progressive decrease in the radii of the spiral paths and thus cause compression of the beams. More particularly, housing 31, 32t 33 is at a reference potential. Conical electrode 40 is at a negative potential as provided by D.C. source 100.Conical electrode 41 is at a negative potential as provided by D.C. source 101. Conical electrode 42 is at a negative potential as provided by D.C. source 102. Similarly, the potentials on electrodes 43 45 and on,a cylinder 35 are established from sources 103 106, respectively.After compression, the beams enter an annular reaction chamber 29 in which ions in the beam from source 16 travel along helical paths in collision courses with respect to ions in the beam from source 17. If the ions from source 16 are deuterium ions and ions from the source 16 are helium 3 ions, then the following well known reaction may take place 2D 3He 4He p 18.3 MeV 1 Two particles result, i.e., a helium atom and a proton, plus 18.3 MeV of energy. The particles at such energy no longer are confined by the field and, thus, may escape to impinge the chamber wall. The energy is then absorbed at the boundaries of the reaction chamber 29. Heat may then be extracted through use of suitable heat exchangers not shown. A problem in such systems is to establish beams of energetic ions of sufficient concentration that fusion producing collisions take place adequate to produce a positive net power gain from the system.To this end, the electric fields applied in the compression zones 20 and 21, FIGURE 1, are such as to force the ions into very thin highly compressed dense beams which travel helical paths at a predetermined pitch or grade in chamber 29. Each ion in each beam will make a plurality of orbits as it traverses reaction zone 22. Collisions will then result in fusion of colliding particles. It is noted at this point that the spaces in which the ions are generated, compressed and reacted are evacuated. The electric fields in compression zone 20 and compression zone 21 are so tailored as to cause the two beams to follow the same helicalvpaths through the reaction chamber 29 at the same radius.The paths shown in FIGURE 1 have been shown as having a very coarse pitch. It is to be understood that his is solely for the purpose of illustration. In actual practice the pitch would be such that in the reaction chamber 29, there would be many orbits of an ion in one beam as it passes through the other beam at the same radius. The electric fields between the housing 31, 32, 33 and the various electrodes are tailored in compression zones 20 and 21 to provide a gradual decrease in the diameter of spiral paths along which the beams travel from sources 16 and 17 to the points where they enter the reaction chamber 29. More or fewer discrete compression fields may be imposed on the ion beams. The beams travel through annular reaction chamber 29 which will generally be referred to hereinafter as cylindrical, with the understanding that the electrodes defining the reaction zone may have continuous curvatures rather than having the conical cylindrical combination shown and it is intended that the latter come within the meaning of the term cylindrical.The annular reaction chamber is of substantially circular symmetry at any given cross section perpendicular to the axis thereof and is bounded by spaced apart outer and inner coaxial electrode walls. The specific configuration will depend upon particular design desired. The present invention provides for control of the ion concentration, as will now be described. FIGURE 2 In accordance with the present invention, the walls of the reaction chamber 29 are so shaped as to provide for strong focusing of the two ion beams as they orbit in opposite directions through reaction zone 29. In FIGURE 2, where by way of example the diameter of the inner cylinder 35 is of the order of 10 cm., the outer surface of cylinder 35 is grooved or splined with longitudinal splines 110 extending into the reaction chamber 29. In a similar manner, the inner wall of the housing 32 is grooved to form splines 112. While in the example illustrated abQut 20 such splines are formed on each of the cylinder 35 and the housing 32, it is preferred that for a 10 cm. inner cylinder 35 about 45 to 55 splines would be formed on the surface of the cylinder 35 and a similar number formed on the inner wall of the housing 32. With the electric field as from source 102, FIGURE 1, effective across the reaction zone, ,the streams of ions orbiting in the reaction chamber 29 will become concentrated as they pass through the high field existing between confronting splines 110 and 112.They will be of lesser concentration as they pass beyond the zones at which the reaction zone is narrowed by the spline configuration. In such a system where from 45 to 55 splines 110 and 112 are employed, the spline height would be about 0.6 cm.The length L of the reaction zone would then be about 16 n meters, where n equals strong focusing index.The value of n may be of the order of from 50 to 200 by the structure utilized herein. The confinement time then becomes important. If the density is of the order of 3.3 x 1014 then the distance between ions is EMI9.1 This is 1 7 of a micron, corresponding to a helical pitch P 7 x 104 per cm. Since L 16 meters, the natural dwell time C is of the order of C 2sRLp 14 seconds where the. 5 x 108 diameter D of the helix is 10 cm.The above relation assumes an axial compaction of ions as well as radial compaction. Strong focusing is applied both radially and axially and both for magnetic and electric fields. Fusion reaction rates are proportional to n2 and their effect will compensate the smaller volumes where concentrations occur. It is assumed that there is compensation for the small volumes by achieving large values of density n. If the strong focusing index is n, then nê V V nê so T will be substantially unaffected. If this is assumed to be so, charge density may be 3.3 x 1414 x 14 5 x 1015 ce This concentration number is well within the ignition region. The total charge during operation is Q n x Ve 3.3 x 1014 x 1200 4 x 1017 .066 coulomb, The electric field gradient Ef 2 x 106 Volt cm., and Q .066 coulomb are rather large quantities to contend with. On the other hand, the cylinder 35 is 16 meters long. The strong focusing arrangement is an electrical analog of known alternating gradient syncrotrons. The splines 110 and 112 play the role of focusing and defocusing lenses, f f where 1 d length, d .3 cm., the distance between two lens sections. By use of this device, there is achieved by properly shaping the splines focusing action many times greater than the restoring force provided by the radial gradient acceleration. This number is multiplied by the focusing index n 50 to 200. FIGURE 3 As above noted, strong focusing in both radial and axial deviations may be employed. In FIGURE 3 corrugations are applied to the axial direction. As shown in FIGURE 3 the cylinder 135, like cylinder 35 of FIGURES 1 and 2, is longitudinally splined. In addition the surface of. the cylinder 135 is circularly ribbed. More particularly, portions 136 and 137 are of greater diameter than portions 138, 139 and 140. Such arrangements give axial focusing. It is possible to spiral, shape them hyperbolically, twist, etc., for special purposesFor the present purpose, the longitudinal splines 110 and 112 of FIGURES 1 and 2 parallel axis 35a.Circular rib portions 136 and 137, FIGURE 3, are oriented normal to axis 35a. The velocities V1 and V2 of the two ion beams are so fixed that they are proper for the desired radius in view of their mass. The mass of deuterium,D is 3.4 x 10 24 gram, and tritium, T is 4 x 10 24 gram. Their velocitie s will be 5.4 108 and 4.4 108 and their angular velocities proportional 1 2 11 g. 2 11 g. If there are 50 splines, the control frequencies Q1 and 2 will be Q1 g2 50w2 2.7 2.7 x 1019 H Q2 2.25 x 1019 Hz. The above frequencies Ql and 2 correspond to 11 and 9 cm. microwaves. With the two frequencies as phase launchers, the maximum concentration areas will be brought into synchronization to maximize the fusion events. Thus far described, strong focusing in either or both radial and axial dimensions may be employed to enhance the ion density at the points in the reaction chamber of highest field intensity. The electric field is greatest where there is relatively short spacing between the confronting crowns of the inner splines and outer splines in the walls of the reaction chamber It is to be understood that further focusing can be achieved in accordance with the present invention, namely in the tangential direction. More particularly, it is well known that if two waves travel through the same space in opposite directions, standing waves are produced. That is, there will be spots of high density. Thus, in accordance with the present invention, tangential focusing is achieved by modulating the grids on the ion sources 16 and 17,FIGURE 1. This causes standing wave bunches to occur at velocity nodes in the reaction chamber. More particularly, a modulating source 71 is employed to provide an accelerating voltage of selectable frequency to the source 16 by way of the phase adjustment unit 72. In a similar manner, a selectable frequency source 73 applies a variable accelerating voltage of selected frequency to ion source 17 by way of phase adjustment unit 74. The velocity nodes can be caused to occur at the points of high ion density produced due to the presence of the spline like structures in the reaction zone.This is done by adjusting the frequencies of the sources 71 and 73 to cause the velocity nodes to occur at the desired spacing tangentially. Since v, if the ions differ in mass then the frequencies f from sources 71 and 73 will have to differ in order for wave length X to be the same for the beams from both sources 16 and 17. The phase units 72 and 74 are adjusted to cause the velocity nodes to occur at the points of minimum spacing between the inner wall and the outer wall of the reaction zone 29. Thus, modulating the ion sources to produce standing waves in the tangential direction further enhances the ion density for promotion of fusion reactions. Having described an embodiment of the invention as illustrated in the accompanying drawings and described in the foregoing Detailed Description, it will be understood that the invention is not limited to the embodiment disclosed, but is capable of numerous rearrangements, modifications and substitutions without departing from the scope of the invention.
