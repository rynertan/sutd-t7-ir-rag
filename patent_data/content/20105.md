# Hydraulic braking system.

## Abstract
A braking system for a towing vehicle having a trailer brake valve 24 and hydraulically operated brakes 12 and a trailer having hydraulically operated brakes 14 . A novel pilot operated control valve 34 directs the output of the trailer brake valve 24 to both the vehicle brakes 12 and the trailer brakes 14 . If the line 46 to the trailer brakes 14 should burst, flow to the trailer brakes is substantially throttled off due to the valve spool 62 shifting to substantially block the flow of fluis through port 40 thereby permitting continued operation of the vehicle brakes. The operating pressure ranges of the brakes may be different. Thus, the operating pressure range of the vehicle brakes 12 is the same as pilot line 74 pressure, which is the output pressure of the brake master cylinder 16 , while the operating pressure range of the trailer brakes 14 is the same as output pressure of the trailer brake valve 24 in line 44 . The trailer brake valve 24 may have an output proportionately different than pilot line pressure.
