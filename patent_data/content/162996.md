## Description
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION It is Known to the battery art that, during charging of a lead acid battery cell of antimony free nature, oxygen may be evolved at the surfaces of positive electrodes when the cell voltage exceeds approximately 2.38 volts. This corresponds to an 85 90 state ofcharge. It is also known that hydrogen may be evolved at the surfaces of negative electrodes, but that this evolution occurs only after the cell has reached a 99 99.5 state of charge. It Is possible, therefore, to construct sealed lead acid cells which require no addition of water to the electrolyte provided that charging is carefully monitored such that cell voltages during charge never exceed 2.38 volts. However, such precise control of cell voltages is relatively expensive.Also, since most batteries comprise a plurality of cells connected in series and since charging characteristics e.g. capacity may vary from cell to cell, most often some cells will be undercharged while others will evolve oxygen. It is known to the art that oxygen evolved at a positive electrode will have the ability to oxidize the surface of a charged negative electrode according to 2Pb O2 4 2PbO and that, in the presence of a sulfuric acid electrolyte, PbO H2S04 P bSO4 H20. Thus oxygen, should it be evolved at a positive electrode and find its way to a negative electrode, will be recombined with hydrogen to produce water while partially discharging the negative electrode which may then, of course, be recharged . Sealed lead acld battery cells have been constructed utilizing this principle. However, to date, these cells have also included a so called starved electrolyte condition. In order to insure that evolved oxygen will have relatively easy access to a charged negative electrode surface the spacing or distance between positive and negative electrodes Is kept relatively small. Separator materials are used to space the electrodes apart from one another and these materials are also used to absorb electrolyte, keeping the said electrolyte in contact with electrode surfaces.However, if these separators are fully saturated with electrolyte the oxygen will not have sufficient access to the negative electrode surfaces. Therefore these separators are generally maintained at a 70 90 saturation level. Since the separators are thin required by the close spacing between electrodes they may not be able to absorb sufficient electrolyte for some applications without exceeding the saturation limit required for oxygen passage, and so the electrodes are starved of electrolyte.The capacity of battery electrodes varies in an inverse relationship to the discharge rate, and so lower discharge rates and deep discharges may require more electrolyte than is available in this so called starved electrolyte configuration. A second drawback of this type of cell is their tendency to form dendritic growths between electrodes, causing internal short circuits. Should the cell be discharged to an extent such that the electrolyte becomes depleted of 504 ions, soluble lead hydrates may be formed at the negative electrodes. These hydrates form dendritic structures which penetrate into the separators. When the cell is recharged, lhe hydrates are reduced to lead, which ultimately causes an internal short circuit and failure of the cell. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to the lead acid battery art, and in particular to batteries and battery cells wherein oxygen is evolved at surfaces of positive electrodes and recombined at surfaces of negative electrodes during the charging process. It is a first object of this invention to provide a sealed rechargeable lead acid battery cell having the capability of recombining oxygen evolved during a charging process, but still containing a quantity of electrolyte sufficient to allow deep discharges at low rates without adversely affecting the life of the said cell. It is another object of this invention to provide a sealed rechargeable lead acid battery cell in which the formation of dendritic growths and short circuits between electrodes is substantially eliminated. It is a third object of this invention to provide sealed rechargeable lead acid battery cells which may be interconnected in series configuration to constitute a battery, and in which the voltage of each of these cells, during a constant current charging process, is self limited to approximately 2.38 volts. It is still another object of this invention to provide electrode sets, which may be included in or added to rechargeable lead acid battery cells of otherwise substantially conventional construction to render the said cells capable of operating in a sealed condition wherein recombination of oxygen evolved during a charging process takes place. It has been found that these and other objectives may be realized by the provision of positive electrode means having 02 evolving and operating portions, either as parts of the same elec trodes or as separate electrodes, and negative electrode means having recombining and operating portions, which also may occur either as parts of the same electrodes or as separate electrodes. The operating portions of the positive and negative electrode means have substantially greater capacity than the 1102 evolving and recombining portions, and these operating portions are spaced apart from one another by relatively thíck, high resistance separator materials.The 1102 evolving portions of the positive electrode means are separated from the recombining portions of the negative electrode means by relatively thin, low resistance separator materials.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENT ION Referring in detail to the Drawing, Figure 1 illustrates one type of rechargeable lead acid battery means of the invention, generally denoted by the arrow 2, comprising a plurality of battery cel Is as 4 received in a common enclosure body or tray 6. Each cell as 4 presents a positive lug as 8 and a negative lug as 10 at an upper side thereof, and the cells are electrically interconnected in a series configuration by means of cell connectors as 12, which are of conventional nature. Each cell as 4 may also include one way pressure relief valve means as 14. Positive and negative terminal posts, denoted by the numerals 16 and 18 respectively, are provided at ends of the series connection of battery cells.Battery means 2 may be considered representative of motive power, load leveling or UPS Uninterrupted Power Supply battery types, for example. Another form of rechargeable lead acid battery means of the invention is illustrated in Figure 2, wherein it is denoted by the arrow 20. Battery means 20 comprises a jar body 22, sealed at an upper side by means of a cover member 24, and internally divided by means of partitions as 26 into a plurality of separate cell compartments as 28 in which components may be received to constitute battery cells. Cells of this type may be connected in series with one another through partitions as 26 in a conventional manner. Positive and negative terminal posts, denoted by the numerals 30 and 32 respectively are provided at ends of the series connection of battery cells, and extend through the cover member 24 in sealed relationship therewith.One way pressure relief valve means as 34 may. be associated with each of the cells, and may also be located through cover members 24 in sealed relationship therewith. Battery means 20 may be considered representative of automotive, emergency lighting, light utility or SLI starting, lighting and ignition battery types, for example. It is pointed out that rechargeable lead acid battery means of the invention may include both of the types disclosed above, as well as other types, some of which will be disclosed below. To insure clarity of disclosure, a detailed description directed toward batteries of the first type arrow 2 of Figure 1 Is presented below, and it is understood that this presentation will be representative of other types of batteries as well. Figure 3 illustrates, in general, a single battery cell arrow 36 which may correspond to one of the cells as 4 in Figure 1. Cell 36 comprises a jar body 38, in which may be received an arrangement of parts including positive and negative electrode means, separator means and an electrolyte body. Jar body 38 may be sealed at its upper side by a cell cover 40, which may include one way pressure relief valve means 42. Extending through cell cover 40, in sealed relationship therewith, are positive and negative lugs denoted by numerals 44 and 46 respectively. Figure 4 and 5 are cross sectional views of cell arrow 36, illustrating in detail an arrangement of parts which may be received in jar body 38. Included in this arrangement of parts is positive electrode means comprising a plurality of positive electrodes as 48, which are of conventional construction, which may be either flat or tubular in nature, and which may be electrically interconnected to one another In parallel relationship by means of a positive bridge member 50 Positive lug 44 extends upward from positive bridge member 50, through cell cover 40 as previously disclosed. All of these positive electrodes as 48 may be substantially identical, but the outermost of these electrodes, denoted by numerals as 52, may be considered to comprise two portions.a conventional operating portion as 54 and an 02 evolving portion as 56. The function of these two portions will be disclosed in detail below. Also included in the arrangement of parts Is negative electrode means comprising a plurality of negative electrodes of conventional construction as 58, interleaved between the positive electrodes as 48, 52, and two thin, recombining negative electrodes as 60, located outside of the positive electrodes as 52. The recombining electrodes as 60 are constructed such that they have substantially less discharge capacity than conventional negative electrodes as 58. Negative electrodes as 58, 60 may be electrically interconnected to one another by means of negative bridge member 62. Negative lug 46 extends upwardly from negative bridge member 62, through cell cover 40 as previously disclosed. tnterleaved between adjacent electrodes as 48, 52, 58, 60 is separator means comprising two separate and distinct types separators as 64, lying between electrodes as 48, 52, 58 are relatively thick and have a relatively high resistance, while separators as 66, lying between electrodes as 52, 60 are quite thin and have a relatively low resistance. Separators as 64 may include ribs as 68 on sides facing positive electrodes as 48, 52. An electrolyte body 70, primarily comprising H2S041 is received in jar member 38, saturating the various separators and other components. Figure 5A illustrates in general a battery electrode, denoted by the arrow 51, which may be representative of either positive and negative electrodes as 48, 52, 58, 60 in a pasted form. In thisFigure numeral 53 denotes a grid structure fabricated from a lead alloy and comprising an outer frame with a plurality of cross members interconnecting opposite sides of the said frame. A connecting lug 55 extends upwardly from the upper part of the said frame. Received within the frame is an electrochemically formed active material body which may be divided into pellets as 57. In the case of positive electrodes, the active material may comprise lead oxides In a pasted form and, in the case of negative electrodes, the active material body may primarily comprise sponge lead also in a pasted form.It is pointed out that the configuration of the grid structure may vary from that shown, and thal the relative thicknesses of these electrodes may also vary. It is known to the art that during charging of a conventional lead acid battery, wherein pure lead is used In the grids of the electrodes, oxygen will be evolved at the surface of the positive electrode when the potential of the cell undergoing the charging process reaches 2.38 2.40 volts, i.e. when it is 85 90 charged. It is also known that hydrogen is generally not evolved until the negative electrodes are 99.0 99.5 charged and, when hydrogen evolution does occur, that this evolution takes place at the surface of the negative electrodes, and that this 99.0 99.5 state of charge of the negative electrodes is not reached until the cell potential substantially exceeds 2.4 volts.Thus it is theoretically possible to provide a sealed leadacid cell, capable of continual operation without the addition of water, provided that the cell potential during charging is very carefully regu lated and restricted to a magnitude less than 2.38 volts. This, however, is not a very practical approach as it may be relatively expensive to provide charging means capable of such precise restriction. In addition, most lead acid batteries comprise a plurality of cells connected in series and, since such cells are never precisely identical, some cells may exceed this potential while others may not reach it. it is also known to the art that gaseous oxygen, whether evolved at the positive electrode or arising from another source, will have the ability to partially oxidize a charged negative electrode according to the following reaction 2Pb 02 2PbO and that, in the presence of a sulfuric acid electrolyte, PbO H2S04 PbSO4 H2O Thus it can be seen that oxygen may be recombined to produce water at the surface of a negative electrode. Indeed, many commerciallyavailable so called sealed lead acid cells utilize this principle, in combination with carefully controlled charging. However, commercially available sealed lead acid cells having this type of oxygen recombining operation also exhibit certain drawbacks. Perhaps the most serious of these arises from the fact that oxygen evolved at the surface of the positive electrode must be brought into contact with the surface of the negative electrode in some fashion. The most commonly used approach to a solution of this problem has been the utilization of the so called starved electrolyte principle. Bearing in mind the fact that these prior art cells are customarily manufactured with only one type of positive electrode, one type of negative electrode and a uniform separator configuration, il can be seen that oxygen may be evolved at the surface of any of the posilive electrodes and recombined at the surface of any adjacent negative electrode.In order that evolved oxygen, which is in the gaseous phase, may have relatively free access to the surface of the negative electrodes the distance between adjacent positive and negative electrodes is kept small preferably less than 2 mm , and the separators, which may be fabricated from a microfibrous material such as glass are not fully saturated with electrolyte. The degree of saturation is commonly 70 90 . Should the degree of saturation be greater, approaching 100 , oxygen transport is inhibited and recombination may not take place. It is known that, as the discharge rate of a lead acid cell is increased, the capacity of its electrodes is decreased. This, in turn, means that amount of electrolyte necessary to provide full electrode capacity at these higher rates may be substantially less than that required for discharge at lower rates. Thus these prior art cells, in order to preserve the short distance between electrodes and the 70 90 degree of saturation, contain only sufficient electrolyte to provide full capacity at a relatively high discharge rate. This is what is meant by a starved electrolyte condition, It is also known that an increased internal cell pressure may enhance the recombination process. The actual recombination reaction takes place in the liquid phase and, by the time the evolved oxygen has reached the wet surface of the negative electrode, it must be dissolved in the electrolyte.The solubility of oxygen in the elec trolyte. will be directly proportional to the pressure. However, cells which utilize this starved electrolyte approach may exhibit certain serious drawbacks. Should such a cell be discharged at a lower rate, or should a discharged cell be allowed to stand in this condition for an extended period of time, the electrolyte H2S04 may become so depleted of 504 ions that soluble lead hydrates may be formed at the negative electrodes. These hydrates tend to form dendritic structures penetrating the separators. When the cell is re charged these hydrates are reduced to lead, which may ultimately bridge between positive and negatjve electrodes causing internal short circuits and failure of the cell.This phenomenon Is known to the art as treei ng . The foregoing drawbacks have been overcome In the instant invention by the arrangement of parts previously disclosed in connection with cell arrow 36 of Figures 4 and 5. The following characteristics of this arrangement are emphasized 1 Separators as 64 are substantially thicker than and have a higher resistance than thin separators as 66 2 the thickness of separators as 64 is sufficient to absorb an amount of electrolyte which is substantially in excess of that required to yield the full capacity of positive electrodes as 48, the operating portions as 54 of positive electrodes as 52 and negative electrodes as 58, even under low rate or deep discharge conditions, while still maintaining separators as 64 in a 70 90 degree of saturation 3 the capacity of the recombining negative electrodes as 60 is substantially less than that of the conventional negative electrodes as 56 4 the thickness of thin separators as 66 is sufficient to absorb an amount of electrolyte which Is substantially in excess of that required to yield the full capacity of the recombining negative electrodes as 60 and the 02 evolving portions as 56 of positive electrodes as 52 even under low rate or deep discharge conditions, and 5 the density of the electrolyte body 70 is substantially constant throughout the cell 36, Figure 6 illustrates diagrammatically a rechargeable leadacid cell of the present invention, similar to cell 36 of Figures 4.and 5, connected to charging means 72 which charging means comprises a source of constant valued direct electrical current.In this figure parallel combinations of the component parts illustrated in Figures 4 and 5 are represented by symbols, and these symbols are denoted by the same numerals as in Figures 4 and 5 but carrying an A suffix. Thus numeral 48A denotes the parallel combination of positive electrodes as 48 in Figures 4 and S, etc. Charging means 72 provides a total charging current IT to the cell 36A. This Is of a constant value throughout the charging process. Current 1T is represented in Figure 6 as dividing into two principal components, I t and 12. Current Ii flows through one portion of the cell comprising positive electrodes 48A, operating portion 54A of positive electrodes 52A, separators as 64A, and conventional negative electrodes 58A. Current 12 flows through 02 evolving portions 56A of positive electrodes 52A, thin separators as 66A, and recombining negative electrodes 60A. It is pointed out that IT 11 12 Figure 7 illustrates in general the relative magnitudes of currents bT. 11 and 12 during the charging process, as well as that of the overall ceil voltage V.Operation of the cell during charging may be most readily understood by referring to this Figure and to Figure 6. At time to Figure 7 , the beginning of the charging process, all electrodes are in a discharged state and so their acceptance ability to accept a charging current is high. However, since the resistance of separators as 64A Figure 6 is substantially greater than the resistance of separator 66A, most of the charging current will flow Through the 02 evolving portion 56A of positive electrode 52A to recombining negative electrode 60A. Thus 11 will be substan tally greater than 12. During the interval to tl Figure 7 the O2 evolving portions 56A of positive electrodes 52A and the recombining negative electrodes 60A become charged very quickly because of the very low capacity of recombining electrodes 60A. This reduces the acceptance of these pairs, and thus current component 11 will decrease sharply in magnitude.Since charging means 72 is providing a constant current IT, such that IT 11 1 20 current component 12 will increase sharply in magnitude over this nterva.l During the interval t1 t2 the majority of the current IT provided by charging means 72 will be directed into current component 12, which will charge positive electrodes 48A, the operating portion 54A cjf positive elecrodes 52A, and conventional negative electrodes 58A.As these electrodes become more fully charged their acceptance will decrease as did the acceptance of electrode parts 56A and 60A during the interval to t1, but Interval t1 t2 will be of substantially longer duration, and the decrease in acceptance much more gradual, because of the higher capacity of electrode parts 48A, 54A and 58A.This decrease in acceptance will reduce current component 12 accordingly, and current component 11 will gradually increase. During the interval t2 t3 the magnitude of current component 1.2 will decrease sharply, and that of 11 will increse sharply.This phenomenon wili take place because the acceptance of electrode parts 48A, 54A and 58A will be reduced during this interval to such an extent that the principal factor governing the relative magnitudes of components 11 and 12 will be the resistances of separators 64A and 66A. As earlier disclosed separator 66A has a substantially lower resistance than separator 66A, and thus the majority of the charging current IT will follow this path of least resistance, i.e, 11. At time t3 the cell may be considered to be substantially charged. During the remainder of the charging process, from time t3 on, the overall cell voltage will have reached 2.38 volts, which is the potential at which oxygen may be evolved at the surface of the positive electrodes. Oxygen will be evolved at those portions of the positive electrodes which are most fully charged, that is, at the surface of 02 evolving portions 56A of electrodes 52A. The evolved oxygen will pass through thin separators 66A and come into contact with the surface of recombining negative electrode, where it will oxidize this surface according to the reaction 2Pb O2 2PbO.Sulfuric acid H2S04 is present, and thus the PbO will be sulfated according to the reaction PbO H2SO4 PbSO4 H2O. The evolved oxygen, therefore, will be recombined into water H20 by the above reactions. Also, It is pointed out that, since one of the products of the above reactions taking place at the recombining negative electrodes 60A is PbS04, these electrodes 60A will be partially discharged by these reactions. When this occurs the cell voltage will fall slightly below the 2.38 volts required for oxygen evolution, and no more oxygen will be produced. The partial discharge of recombining negative electrode 60A will slightly increase the acceptance of these electrodes and thus current component I will increase slightly while current component I 1 2 will decrease slightly. Current component 11 will recharge electrodes 60A, causing a slight decrease in its acceptance, thereby producing a slight decrease in current component 11 and a slight Increase in current component 12. This recharging also allows the cell voltage to rise to 2.38 volts, whereupon oxygen may again be evolved at the surface of 02 evolving portions 56A of positive electrodes 52A. This cycle may be repeated indefinitely, as long as the cell remains connected to charging means 72. Thus, a plurality of similar cells may be connected in series to provide a battery of the invention such as that denoted by the arrow 2 in Figure I, and the cells themselves will limit their own voltage. This enables such a battery to be charged by a relatively inexpensive constant current charging means without the dangle of an imbalance between cells. Figure 8 is a diagrammatic representation simila to Figure 6, but showing the cell 36A connected to load means 74. Current com ponenis similar to IT, It and 12 flow through the same parts of the cell, but in a reverse direction as shown these are denoted IT 1i and 120 respectively. Figure 9 illustrates the relative magnitudes of these current components, as well as overall cell voltage V . Referring to Figure 9, at time to the start of the discharge , most of the load current IT may be supplied by the 02 evolving portions 56A of positive electrodes 52A and recombining negative electrodes 60A. This current component is denoted l1 it is substan tally higher than current component 12 because the resistance of separators 66A is substantially less than that of separators 64A. However, the capacity of the recombining negative electrodes 60A is quite low, as earlier disclosed, and thus over the interval to1 t11 electrodes 60A will be quickly discharged and current com ponent 11 will decrease sharply in magnitude, while current component 12 will increase sharply. After time t10 substantially all of the load current 1T arises from electrode parts 48A, 54A, 58A via current 12 . It is also possible to construct a cell according to the instant invention having an excess of electrolyte in a so called flooded condition. Such a cell is illustrated In Figure 10, wherein it is denoted by the arrow 76. An electrode group, generally denoted by the arrow 78, is received in a jar body 60. Electrode group 78 may correspond to the arrangement of parts disclosed in connection with Figure 4, including positive electrodes as 48, 52 negative electrodes as 58, 60 and separators as 64, 66 in this Figure. Also received in jar body 80 is an electrolyte body 82, extending over the top of the electrode group 78.Cell 76 is sealed at its upper side by cell cover 84, through which extend in sealed relationship thereto positive lug 86 and negative lug 88, In this cell 76, when oxygen is produced at the surface of 1102 evolving portions of the outermost positive electrodes, a small internal pressure may be generated. This will insure that additional evolved oxygen will form small bubbles which will first push aside the electro lyte in the thin separators, and be transported to the surface of the recombining negative electrodes where they will dissolve in the electro lyte Alternatively, the cell may be given a small deliberate overpressure by pressurizing with nitrogen or an inert gas, for example.Oxygen recombination will occur in the same fashion as previously disclosed. In the design of any battery or cell according to this invention it is important to balance the thicknesses of the various electrodes and separators such that the utilization of the electrolyte during discharge will be uniform throughout the cell in order to prevent a localized deficiency of 504 ions and subsequent treeing. It is essential that the lead alloys used throughout the cells be free from antimony. It is also important to provide a sufficient surface area for the Urecomb ining negative electrodes, and thus it may be desirable to include one or more additional sets of recombinant electrodes, which may take one of the forms disclosed below. Such electrode sets need not necessarily be combined with an arrangement of parts precisely as that disclosed in connection with Figures 4 9, but may also be used in cells of more conventional construction and still provide oxygen recombination and cell voltage limitation. One embodiment of such an electrode set, denoted by the arrow 90, is illustrated in Figure 11. In this Figure numerals as 92 denote positive electrodes, numerals as 94 denote thin, low resistance separators, and numeral 96 denotes a recombining negative electrode. Such electrode sets may be included in place of one or more conventional positive electrodes in a battery cell such as cell 36 of Figure 3, or in place of one or more positive electrodes as 48 in Figures 4 and 5, for example. Positive electrodes as 92 will be electrically interconnected in parallel with the other positive electrodes within the cell, and recombining negative electrode 96 will be electrically connected in parallel with the other negative electrode within the cell. Again, other separator materials included in the cell must be of substantially greater thickness and higher resistance than the thin separators as 94, as previously disclosed. Oxygen recombination and cell voltage limitation will take place in the same manner as previously disclosed. It is pointed out that positive electrodes as 92 may be thinner than the other positive electrodes in the cell. It is only necessary that the pair of positive electrodes as 92, taken together, have a capacity equivalent to that of each of the other positive electrodes plus sufficient extra capacity to balance the relatively low capacity of recombining negative electrode 96. Similarly, each positive electrode as 52 of Figures 4 and 5 may have a capacity in its operating portion as 54 only equivalent to one half of the capacity of one of the conventional positive electrodes as 48, plus additional capacity in its 1102 evolving portion 56 sufficient to balance the capacity of a recombining negative electrode as 60. Another form of electrode set, which may be added to vir tally any cell of conventional nature to provide oxygen recombination and cell voltage limitation is illustrated In Figure 12, wherein it is generally denoted by the arrow 98. Electrode set 98 comprises a thin central positive foil electrode 100,. a pair of thin, low resistance separator members as 102, and a pair of thin recombining negative Foil electrodes as 104. Positive foil electrode 100 comprises a central reinforcing substrate 106 of a plastic material such as polyester, to which is affixed, on both sides thereof, a layer of PbO2 as 108. This electrode may be fabricated, for example, by depositing layers of lead upon either side of the substrate 106 by vacuum deposition or by other. means, and then electrochemically forming the lead in an acid bath to transform it into PbO2. All of the PbO2 of this electrode may be considered to be an 02 evolving portion. Recombining negative foil electrodes as 104 may comprise a similar substrate as 110, having a layer of lead affixed to one side.Negative electrodes as 104 may then he electrochemically formed by a PlantB formation process or may be chemically etched such that outer layers as 112 of sponge lead are produced while inner layers of solid lead as 114 are maintained. The sponge lead layers as 112 define and limit the capacity of negative electrodes as 104 since the solid lead layers as 110 do not enter into the reaction rather, these layers as 114 function as current carrying means. The capacity of each of the PbO2 layers as 108 of positive electrode 100 should be somewhat greater than the capacity of a sponge lead layer as 112 of a recombining negative electrode as 104, so that layers as 108 never become fully sulfated during discharge. One or more electrode sets as 98 may be included in virtually any battery cell to constitute a battery cell of the invention. Recornbining negatives as 104 will be electrically connected in parallel with the other negative electrodes within the cell, and thin positive electrodes as 100 will be electrically connected in parallel with the other positive electrodes within the cell. It is emphasized that separa tors as 102 must be thinner than and have a substantially lower resis tance than the other separators within the cell. It is pointed out that recombining negative electrodes as 60 of Figures 4 and 5 may be of a construction similar to recombining negative electrodes 104 of Figure 12, as an alternative to the pasted form disclosed in connection with Figure 5A. A similar electrode set, generally denoted by the arrow 116 in Figure 13, comprises a single recombining negative foil elec trode 118, substantially Identical to recombining negative foil elec trode 104 of Figure 12. A thin positive foil electrode 120, comprising a substrate 122 having a layer 124 of PbO2 affixed to only one side, is spaced apart from negative electrode 118 by a thin separator member 126. Similar rules for construction of the electrode set and its connec tion within a cell will apply. Electrode sets as 98 Figure 12 and 116 Figure 13 function in exactly the same manner as previously disclosed in connection with earlier Figures. Current components similar to II, l1 Figures 5 and 7 will flow through the remaining electrodes in the cell. It is possible to construct foil type electrodes having both the recombining and voltage limiting features characteristic of electrodes of the invention and relatively high capacity operating characteristics. A raw form of such an electrode is illustrated in Figure 14, wherein it is generally denoted by the arrow 128, Electrode 128, in this so called raw form, comprises a plaslic substrate 130, having a thin layer 132 of lead affixed to one side and a relatively thick layer 134 of lead affixed to the other side. A rule of thumb may be that layer 134 should be about 10 times thicker than layer 132. A positive electrode may be fabricated from such a raw electrode 128 simply by electrochemically forming all of the lead in layers 132, 134 into PbO2. Layer 132 will thus become an 02 evolving portion, and layer 134 an operating portion. A negative electrode may also be fabricated from a raw electrode such as electrode 128. Such an electrode, however, must have a final form such as that illustrated in Figure 15, wherein it is denoted by the arrow 136. In this Figure numeral 138 denotes a plastic substrate, corresponding to substrate 130 of Figure 14 On one side of substrate 138 is a thin layer of lead arrow 140, which is divided into two portions, one portion 142 being solid lead and the other portion 144 being sponge lead. Portion 144 is a recombining portion, while portion 142 is a current carrying portion. On the other side of substrate 138 is a relatively thick layer of lead arrow 146, which is also divided into two portions, one portion 148 being a current carrying portion of solid lead and the other portion 150 being an operating portion of sponge lead.Current carrying portions 142, 148 may comprise roughly 50 of layers 140, 146 respectively. Sponge lead portions 144 and 150 may be produced by etching, by Planter formation, or by other means. It niay be necessary during this production of sponge lead portions 144 and 150 to first provide the thin lead layer 140 corresponding to layer 132 of raw electrode 128, Figure 14 with a protective coating to preclude chemical electrochemical reaction at this portion, and then produce about 90 of the desired sponge lead portion 150 45at of the full lead layer 1461. Thereafter the protective coating may be removed, and the process continued until 50 of thin lead layer 140 has been transformed into lead portion 144 and sponge lead portion 150 has been increased to 50 of layer 146. Figure 16 illustrates a typical electrode group arrow 152 comprising such electrodes. Positive electrodes as 154 and negative electrodes as 156 are interleaved in staggered form as shown, with the low resistance separator members as 158 and thick, high resistance separators as 160 interleaved therebetween. Positive electrodes as 154 may be interconnected at one side of group 152 by a cast lead body 162, and negative electrodes may be interconnected at the other side of group 152 by another cast lead body 164. Practicality of production may require that negative electrodes of this type be fabricated from two separate bodies as shown inFigure 17. In this Figure numeral 166 denotes a plastic substrate to one side of which is affixed a thin lead layer arrow 168. About 50 of lead layer 168 comprises a recombining sponge lead portion 170, produced by etching, Planter formation or some other means, and the remainder of layer 168 comprises a solid lead current carrying portion 172. Numeral 174 denotes a second plastic substrate, to one side of which is affixed a relatively thick lead layer arrow 176. About 50 of layer 176 comprises a sponge lead portion 178, and the remainder comprises a solid lead portion 180.The foils may be placed such that the two substrates 166, 174 lie back to back as shown, and the aggregate may be considered a single electrode from this point onward. This approach simplifies somewhat the formation process, since the necessityTor a protective coating may be eliminated. It is pointed out that a plurality of foil electrodes as disclosed above may be assembled together to produce a substantially rectangular electrode group, such as grqup 156 of Figure 16, and this group may be placed in a rectangular jar body along with electrolyte to constitute a cell similar to that illustrated in Figure 3. Alternatively, the foil electrodes may be provided in continuous strip form, interleaved with strips of separator material and wound in a spiral to produce a jelly roll type of cylindrical cell. Such a cell, generally denoted by the arrow 182, is illustrated, partially broken away, in Figure 18. In this Figure numeral 184 denotes a positive electrode strip, numeral 186 a negative electrode strip, numeral 188 a strip of thin, low resistance separator material and numeral 190 a strip of thick, high resistance separator material. Figures 19 21 illustrate pasted type negative electrodes in which a recombining portion may be provided as a part of an otherwise conventional negative electrode. In Figure 19 arrow 192 denotes, in general, one such electrode, comprising a grid ructure 194, which may be fabricated from an antimony free lead alioy, and pasted negative active material portions as 196. An upper portion 198 of grid structure 194 is substantially thicker than the rem . nder of electrode 192, and outer surfaces of this thicker upper portior 198 are provided with thin layers of negative active material as 00, which comprise recombining negative portions. The said thin layers may be provided by etching these surfaces, by Plante forminc these surfaces, or by providing the thicker portion 198 with shallow recesses in which pasted active material may be received as shown in Fig l e 20. An alternative embodiment of this form of pa. ed negative electrode is denoted by the arrow 202 in Figure 21. In his embodiment an upper portion 203 of a grid structure 204 is fitted, on opposite side thereof, with etched or Planter formed sponge lead strips as 206, which may be riveted to upper portion 203 in a conventional manner to constitute recombining negative electrode portions. Figure 22 illustrates, partially broken away, a battery cell arrow 208 including a plurality of negative electrodes as 210 similar to that shown in Figures 19 and 20. Also included in cell 208 is a plurality of positive electrodes 212, thin, low resistance separators as 214, and thick, high resistance separators as 216. An electrolyte body 218 may be substantially absorbed in the various separators, etc.Negative electrodes as 210 include thick upper grid portions as 220, upon which lie thin recombining active material layers as 222. Outermost negative electrodes as 224 include thicker upper grid portions as 226 projecting from one side only, and have recombining1, active material layers as 228 on the surfaces of these portions. During charging the portions of the surfaces of the positive electrodes as 212 lying immediately adjacent to recombining layers as 222, 228 function as 02 evolving portions, and oxygen evolved at these portions passes through thin separators as 214 to recombine at recombining portions 222, 228 in the manner previously disclosed.In addition, any other gaseous oxygen which might be evolved at lower portions of positive electrodes as 212 will tend to rise to the top of the cell and will be forced to pass by, and thus be in close proximity to, recombining negative portions as 222, 228, where it will be recombined in the manner previously disclosed. It may also be desired, particularly in the case of tubular positive electrodes, to combine the electrodes with a plastic cover member overlying the uppermost portion of these positive eiectrodes. Such an arrangement is shown in Figure 23, wherein a portion of a cell arrow 230, similar in other respects to cell 208 of Figure 22 is illustrated. Positive electrodes as 232 include plastic covers as 234 over their upper sides. In other respects cell 230 is the same as cell 208 of Figure 22. The arrangement of Figure 23 insures that no oxygen may be evolved at the very top of positive electrodes as 232, where it might escape into space 236 at the top of cell 230 without coming into contact with negative recombining portions as 238. Oxygen will only evolve at those portions of the surface of positive electrode as 232 which are below the plastic covers as 234. In general, in cells of the invention, the thin, low resistance separators should be fabricated from a microfibrous material, preferably having fibers 1 lim or less in diameter, or from a nonwoven synthetic material. Glass is a preferred material. The thicker, higher resistance separators may be materials such as microporous rubber, PVC, microporous polyethylene, etc. Also in general, when separate recombining negative elec trodes are employed, such as number 60 in Figures 4 and 5, they may be fabricated either as lead foils or as more conventional, pasted nega tive electrodes having grid structures such as the electrode denoted by the arrow 51 in Figure 5A. In the second instance it may be desirable to increase the conductivity of the grid structure 53. This may be accomplished by fabricating grid structure 53 from copper or some other metal having a conductivity greater than that of lead, and then coating the entire grid structure with lead. This may increase the magnitude of the current components which pass through the said recombining negative electrodes.
