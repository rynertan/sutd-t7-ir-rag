# Optical fibre transmission lines.

## Abstract
An optical fibre transmission line is installed by first installing a conduit 11 having one or more bores 12 and subsequently inserting flexible, lightweight optical fibre members 14 containing the optical fibres 22, 32 into the bores 12 . The optical fibre members 14 are propelled by em ploying the fluid drag of air, or another suitable gas, passed at high velocity through the bores 12 .
