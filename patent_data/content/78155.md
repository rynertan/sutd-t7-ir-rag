# Crosslinking halogen containing polymer.

## Abstract
Halogen containing polymers can be crosslinked by heat curing with a crosslinking system made up of a crosslinking agent which is either a polymercaptan or an ester derivative thereof, a basic material and a hydrated salt. When the hydrated salt is chosen so that it releases its water of hydration during heat curing, the rate of crosslinking is enhanced.
