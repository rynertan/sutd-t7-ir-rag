# Composition for use as a precursor for a casing layer in the cultivation of mushrooms, process for the preparation of a casing layer and process for the cultivation of mushrooms.

## Abstract
In the cultivation of mushrooms from an underlying bed containing mushroom spores, novel compositions and pro cesses are provided for a casing layer which is placed over the compost layer containing spawning mycelium. A hydrophilic, thermosetting prepolymer resin is mixed in with a casing substrate, preferably Canadian peat, other optional additives and sufficient amount of water to form a slurry, and the mix ture is allowed to cure to a spongy block. The cured material is then pulverized and deposited as a casing layer over the compost layer. Because of the high water retention qualities of this material, watering the mushroom beds is reduced by a factor of three or more, thereby reducing operation and pro duction costs, as also the incidence and severity of disease and displeasing blemishes.
