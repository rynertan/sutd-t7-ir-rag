# Interface beads for mixed bed ion exchange resins.

## Abstract
Improved beads for use in the interfacial separation of anion and cation exchange beads are spherical, hydrolytically stable polymer beads having a controlled particle size, controlled density and a water wettability. The beads comprise a hy drophobic monomer, a hydrophilic monomer and a crosslinking monomer. The interface beads allow for the preparation of mixed bed exchange resin compositions having improved life cycles and improved resin efficiencies.
