# Permanent magnet rotary dynamo electric machine.

## Abstract
A permanent magnet rotary dynamo electric machine wherein each permanent magnet pole 13 is equipped with a flux shunt 18 which provides a direct flux path between the airgap at the strong tip region of the pole and the iron circuit 12 upon which the pole is supported, the direct flux path shunting magnetic flux to the iron circuit when the cur rent in the associated windings is low, but being saturated by flux flowing in the opposite direction at high values of winding current.
