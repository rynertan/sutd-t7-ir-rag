# Frequency synthesizer having means for suppressing frequency instability caused by intermittent PLL operation.

## Abstract
Frequency instability in a frequency synthesizer having a PLL circuit 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 operated intermittently to save its power consumption has been avoided by providing a means to suppress such instability. The instability has been found to be caused by phase uncertainty between reference frequency f
