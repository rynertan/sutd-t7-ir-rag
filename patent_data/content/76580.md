## Description
METHOD OF COMBATING NEMATODE PESTS OF PLANTS AND COMPOSITIONS THEREFOR This invention relates to a method of combating nematode pests of plants and to compositions for use in the method. Nematodes are economically important pests of agriculture which affect adversely the yields of many food and fibre crops. The nematodes are soil dwelling pests which attack the roots of plants. They are difficult to control and measures proposed previously involve fumigation of the soil with volatile halocarbon toxicants such as dichlorodibromopropene or treatment of the soil with nematocidally active insecticides such as oxamyl or carbofuran.It has liong been recognised that the most effective treatment would be one in which the toxicant is applied to the aerial parts of the plant by spraying or dusting and is then trans located to the roots to combat and control the nematode pests surrounding and attacking the roots but this method has never been very successfully practiced with the known toxicants because they do not have adequate trans location properties. We have now discovered that certain macrolide antibiotic materials have both the necessary trans location and the nematocidal properties to permit the successful and practical application of this desirable method of nematode control. Accordingly the present invention provides a method of combating and controlling soil dwelling nematode pests of growing plants rooted in the soil and susceptible to damage by nematode pests which comprises applying to the aerially exposed parts of the plant, a nematocidally effective amount of an insecticidally active macrolide substance, preferably one selected from the groups consisting of C 076 and B 41 antibiotics and their simple derivatives including acylated derivatives, aglycones, and the like .C 076 and B 41 macrocyclic antibiotic substances and their derivatives hereinafter called the active ingredients are fully described in the following patents the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference viz.

Such C 076 antibiotics are also known as avermectins and B 41 antibiotics are also known as milbemycins.Particular examples of C 076 antibiotics useful in the invention method include that known as avermectin Bla the structure of which is given by Chabala et al, J.Agric Food Chem 1981, 29, 881 884 at 885, and that known as Ivermectin which is the 22,23dihydro derivative of avermectin Bla and has theEMI2.1 tb structure SEP SEP UMe tb SEP HOMMH SEP 0 tb SEP O4e SEP v tb SEP 0Xs tb SEP OH tb A particular example of a B 41 macrolide substance is that known as milbemycin B 41D which is described inNetherlands Patent Application No. 8004791A, having the structureEMI2.2 C 076 and B 41 macrolide substances are obtained by fermentation proceses using certain Streptomyces species. A particularly useful C 076 producing Streptomyces species is that known as Streptomyces avermitilis a culture of which has been deposited in the permanent culture collection of the Fermentation Section of the NorthernUtilization Research Branch, US, Department of Agriculture at Peoria, Illinois, USA and has been assigned the accession number NRRL 8165. A further sample of this culture has been deposited, without restriction as to availability, in the permanent culture collection of theAmerican Type Culture Collection at 12301 Parklawn Drive,Rockville, Maryland 20852, USA, and has been assigned the accession number ATCC 31267. Other strains and mutants of S. avermitilis may also be used in this invention process, including, for example, those deposited at theAmerican Type Culture Collection under the accession numbers ATCC 31271 and 31272. A particularly useful B 41 producing Streptomyces species is that known as the B41 146 strain fully described in US patent 3,984,564 which has been deposited at the Research Institute of Industrial Technology ofMicro organisms, Agency of Industrial Science andTechnology of Japan, under the deposition numberBikokenkinki no 1438, and at the Northern ResearchLaboratory, US Department of Agriculture, Peoria, Illinois,USA under the deposit number NRRL 5739. The process of producing B 41D is set forth in US Patent 4,346,171 the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference. A yet further macrolide substance produced by aStreptomyces species which may also be useful in the method of the invention is that described in published EuropeanPatent Application no. 0050964 the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference , a sample of which has been deposited at the American Type Culture Collection under the accession number 31587. The method of the invention is preferably performed by applying to the foliage of the plant a sprayable liquid composition either using a conventional spray system or an electrodynamic spray system, the compositions comprising from 0.00001 to 1 by weight of the active ingredients in volumes of between 10 and 1000 1 aha. The method may be widely practised on crops having aerial foliage and liable to infestation by soil dwelling nernatodes, such as for example, vegetable crops such as potatoes and tomatoes, citrus crops, tobacco, bananas, and root crops such as sugar beet. Species of nematodes which may be controlled by the invention method include the following Globodera rostochiensis potato cyst nematode Heterodera schachtii beet cyst nematode Meloidogyne incognita root knot nematode Meloidogyne javanica tobacco root knot nematode Pratylenchus penetrans lesion nematode Radopholus similis burrowing nematode Tylenchulus semipenetrans citrus nematode The trans location of the active ingredient from the sprayed foliage to the roots, which is believed to be via the phloem system of the plant, is extremely rapid and nematodes in the soil adjacent to the roots are controlled within one day of application. The treatment also provides long lasting control. Thus nematodes are controlled to an extent of 90 or more for a period of more than two weeks after spraying an ivermectin composition containing 0.1 by weight of the active ingredient. The treatment causes the root to produce a nematode controlling exudate which probably contains the macrolide or a derivative or metabolite thereof. This exudate can be collected for at least two weeks after treatment by washing the roots of the treated plants and can be shown to be active against nematodes of the species Meloidogyne incognita. Because the method of the invention relies upon foliar application of the macrolide a single treatment may be used to combat nematode pests in the soil and other insect pests on the foliage. This is particularly useful in crops such as sugar beet which are susceptible both to nematode damage and infection with virus disease borne by aphids. Compositions for use in the invention include sprayable liquid compositions obtained by water dilution of emulsifiable concentrates, suspension concentrates, soluble liquid compositions and the like. Such sprayable compositions may contain from 0.00001 to 1.0 by weight of the macrolide substance. The concentrated compositions, in the form in which they are prepared, transported and stored, may contain from 0.5 to 50 by weight of the macrolide, depending upon the type of composition.Generally soluble liquid compositions have lower concentrations of active ingredient than emulsifiable concentrates or suspension concentrates. The compositions also contain surface active agent emulsifying agents in an amount from 1 to 20 by weight. These surface agents are usually selected from anionic types such as alkali metal or alkaline earth metal salts of sulphosuccinate or liqnosulphonic acids, eg. sodium dioctylsulphosuccinate, sodium and calcium lignosulphonates, and nonionic types such as ethoxylated alkyl phenols and alcohols, eg.ethoxylated nonylphenol. Suspension concentrates may also contain anti settling agents such as bentonite to improve the shelf life of the compositions. The method of the invention is illustrated by the following Examples. EXAMPLE 1 A preparation containing 500 parts per million of avermectin Bla was prepared by dissolving the compound in a mixture of diethyl carbonate, acetone and ethanol 1 1 1 by volume containing 6 by volume of a wetting agent known as Arylan CA. Arylan is a Registered Trade Mark. Arylan CA is a 70 w v solution of calcium dodecylbenzenesulphonate in n butanol . The mixture was diluted with a 5 w v sucrose solution such that the diluted mixture contained 5 by volume of the solvent mixture. 0.67 ml of the diluted mixture was then applied to the upper and lower leaf surfaces and the aerial part of the stems of young tomato plants rooted in soilfilled pots. Three replicates were used for each rate of chemical applied. 48 hours later the soil in each pot was inoculated with 600 700 larvae ca. 24 hours old of the root knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita and the pots were then kept at 250C and 60 70 RH for three weeks, with twice daily watering of the soil surface. At the end of this period the plants were removed from the soil and the number of root knots assessed and compared with those developed in control plants. There was a 77 reduction in the number of root knots in the treated plants. The known nematocide oxamyl produced only 9 reduction when applied in the same manner at a rate of 2000 ppm. EXAMPLE 2 This Example illustrates the persistence of nematicidal effect obtained by the method of the invention. Young tomato plants rooted in soil filled pots were sprayed with 5 ml of preparations containing 4000, 2000 and 1000 parts per million of ivermectin. The preparations were otherwise identical to that of Example 1 . The soil of different groups of pots was inoculated with day oldMeloidogyne incognita larvae in the manner of Example 1 after 2,7 and 14 days A, B and C in the following table and the percentage root knot reduction compared with a control assessed in the manner of Example 1.The results were as follows EMI7.1 tb SEP SEP Root SEP knot SEP reduction tb Rate SEP A SEP B SEP C tb ppm tb 4000 SEP 96 SEP 100 SEP 100 tb 2000 SEP 87 SEP 99 SEP 100 tb 1000 SEP 86 SEP 93 SEP 99 tb EXAMPLE 3 This Example illustrates an emulsion concentrate suitable for application, when diluted, in the method of the invention.
