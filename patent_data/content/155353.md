# TRANSITION BETWEEN BATCH PREHEATING AND LIQUEFYING STAGES

## Abstract
A rotary batch preheating kiln 10 feeding batch mate rials 60 to a batch liquefying vessel 12 is separated from the liquefying vessel 12 by a transition section including duct means 48 to direct exhaust gas from the liquefying vessel 12 to the interior of the rotary kiln 10 at a location spaced from the discharge location of the kiln. The transition section also shields the rotary kiln 10 from radiant heat from the liquefaction vessel 12 .
