# Improved method and device for use with automated chemical analyses.

## Abstract
This invention is adapted for use with automated chemistry analyzers and is directed to an improved method and device by which a precise measured quantity of reagent is combined with an assay medium. Prior to such delivery, the reagent, being water soluble or dispersible, is contained within carrier solid organic binder which is fixed within and constitutes part of the device. Upon addition of an aqueous medium, the carrier binder is dissolved or dispersed, the protected precise measured quantity of reagent is concom itantly released and dissolved.
