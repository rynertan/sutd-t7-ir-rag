# Radiation image recording and reproducing method.

## Abstract
A radiation image recording and reproducing method which is improved in efficiency of erasure and comprises steps of i causing a radiation image storage panel containing a divalent europium activated barium fluorohalide stimulable phosphor to absorb a radiation having passed through an object or having radiated from an object ii exposing the panel to stimulating rays to release the radiation energy stored therein as light emission iii detecting the emitted light and iv exposing the panel to light having a wavelength at least within the stimulation wavelength region of the phos phor to erase the radiation energy remaining therein, in which said stimulating rays are electromagnetic waves having a wavelength within the range of 640 900 nm.
