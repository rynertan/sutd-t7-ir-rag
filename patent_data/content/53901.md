# Coupling.

## Abstract
A coupling 10 for coupling two tubular elements in sealed relationship. The coupling 10 comprises a first tubular member 12 having an outer end 14 for connection to one tubular element, and having an inner end 16 comprising an axially extending locking sleeve 18 , which has an annular gripping zone 20 having a plurality of annular gripping teeth 22 along its inner surface 24 and cam means 26 along its outer surface, and being radially compressible in the gripping zone 20 . The coupling further comprises a second tubular member 30 having an outer end 32 for connection to another tubular element, and having an inner end 34 comprising an inner barrel 36 , has further an annular locking piston 38 being axially displace able relatively to the first tubular member 12 and the locking piston 38 having a locking zone 40 with com plementary cam means 42 to cooperate with the cam means 26 of the gripping zone 20 .
