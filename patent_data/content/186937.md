# Rotating anode x ray tube.

## Abstract
An x ray tube device with an anode target capable of ro tion and a cathode which generates electrons causing them to collide with the target set in a vacuum envelope, and with a shaft which supports and rotates the anode pro jecting outside the envelope. This x ray tube device has a stucture such that the target is cooled by coolant flowing through coolant channels in the shaft. A vacuum seal is maintained by seal means, such as magnetic fluid seal, be tween the envelope and the rotating shaft. The envelope and coolant channels are best maintained at ground poten tial and thus have an intermediate potential, with high posi tive and negative voltages supplied to the anode target and cathode.
