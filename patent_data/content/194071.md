# A method of making a parachute.

## Abstract
There is disclosed a method of manufacturing a parachute canopy or a part thereof, where a canopy is made of canopy material and reinforcements going through the canopy, with attachment points 3 being formed on the edges characterised of the canopy area, that one attachment point 3 is chosen as a starting point and that one attachment point 3 is chosen as a starting point and a continuous reinforcement 1 is brought from the starting point to another attachment point and there from again back to the starting point or to another attachment point, back and forth between attachment points 3 , thus forming over the area a reinforcement net, and finally attaching the reinforcements 1 into the canopy 2 .
