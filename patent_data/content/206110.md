# Crane apparatus having hydraulic control system.

## Abstract
A crane apparatus having a hydraulic system for controll ing the operation of the hoist and bridge, and gantry drive func tions of the equipment. The hoist, bridge and drive compo nents are driven by an AC motor that is powered by an AC gen erator. The AC motor in turn operates a variable displacement hydraulic pump which is variable from zero to a maximum flow rate in either direction for infinite speed control. The output of the hydraulic pumps is directed to respective hydraulic motors which drive the particular function being controlled.
