## Description
BYDRATRICAIJLY POWERED COMPESSOF AND HYDRAULIC CONTROL AND POWER SYSTEM THEREFOR. vhe invention relates to a hvdraulically powered comPressor, and hydraulic control and power svstem therefor, for elevating the pressure of gaseous substances, wherein infinitely variable capacitv control is provided. Prior art compressors for compressing qaseous substances such as air, nitrogen or methane all suffer from one mayor disadvantage.Such prior art compressors do not provide infinitely variable capacity control with a proportionately variable horsepower requirement. Such prior art compressors have attempted to alleviate this disadvantage by utilizing various means of capacitv control such as valve unloaders or variable or fixed volume pockets. These types of capacity controls are limited in ranae. Valve unloaders provide large capacity changes or capacity spikes . Compressors driven by reciprocating engines or turbines provide smooth capacity control over a portion of the speed ranae of the engine or turbine, but the engine or turhine cannot normallv he used to operate the compressor when the speed of the engine or turbine falls below 50 of its maximum speed.Below 508 sneed these units must use a bypass valve which bypasses the excess capacity not reauired. This process is extremely inefficient because the horsepower required does not chanqe. This inefficiency becomes more of a factor on constant speed compressors with no unloaders or pockets installed. In situations such as when a compressor is being utilized to compress and elevate the pressure of natural gas flowing from a wellhead, the flow conditions of the gas which is entering the compressor may vary widely. If small volumes of flowing gas are entering the compressor, it is necessary for the compressor to operate very slowly in order to act uton the natural gas to raise it to the desired pressure. ronversly, if a large volume of natural sas is naturally flowing from the welthead, the compressor must operate more quickly to compress the larqer volume of natural gas to the desired elevated pressure.Thus, it would be very desirable to have a compressor which is operable at an infinitely variable speed, so as to be able to be operahle over a wide range of incoming gas flow conditions. Other disadvantages associated with prior art compressors are that they are extremely complicated in their design and manufacture, thus increasing the cost associated with manufacturing and servicing such compressors. Particularly in the case of compressors which may be utilized at remote wellhead locations, it is important that the compressor may be readily serviced and repaired.Further, many prior art compressors provide coolina for the compressor assembly, which cooling isProvided by a water jacket. thus, such compressors reauire a source of water or a closed cooling system in order to dissipate the heat caused bv the compression of the qaseous substance. Such a water source may he unavailahle at many remote locations. Additionally, such compressors require additional components, such as water pumps which are readily susceptible to maintenance problems. Accordingly, prior to the development of the present invention, there has been no Thvdraulicallv powered compressor or hydraulic control and power system therefor, which provides infinitely variable capacity control with a proportionately variable horsepower requirement is efficient and economical in its design is readily serviced and repaired and does not require water cooling. Therefore, the art has sought a hydraulically powered compressor, and hydraulic control and power system therefor, which provides infinitelv variable capacity control is efficiently and economically manufactured is easily readily repaired and serviced and is air cooled. In accordance with the invention the foresoinq advantages have been achieved through the present hvdrauJicallv powered compressor and hvdrauAic control and power system therefor.

Another feature of the present invention is that the means for forcing air includes a fan and a hydraulic motor therefor, the motor having a pressure regulating valve, and a pressure compensated f3ow control valve associated therewith, and the flow control valve is associated and disposed between the variable displacement hydraulic pump and the motor, whereby the fan operates at a constant speed to provide cooling to the first and second coolina coils, first and second pistons and cylinders and hvEraulic power piston and cylinder and to blow out of the air cooling duct any accumulated gaseous substances.An additional feature of the present invention is that a cooling chamber is provided between the hydraulic power piston and cylinder and each of the first and second pistons and cylinders, each cooling chamber surrounding a portion of the piston rod and including means for directinq air flow from the means from forcing air over the piston rod. A further feature of the present invention is that the first and second pistons and compression cylinders and hydraulic power piston and cylinder are disposed on a mounting plate by means of two mounting bolts, whereby transmission of stress forces to the compression cylinders and power cylinder from the mounting plate deflection is qreatlv minimized. An additional feature of the Present invention is that the first and second pistons are threaded affixed in a first direction to the piston rod and are secured to the piston rod bv a locking member which is threaded into theDiston rod in a second opposite direction.

While the invention will be described in connection with the preferred embodiment, it will be understood that it is not intended to limit the invention to that embodiment. On the contrary, it is intended to cover all alternatives, modifications, and eauivalents as may be included within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. Detailed nescription of the Invention In FIG. 1, the hydraulically powered compressor 51 of the present invention for elevating the Pressure of gaseous substances, such as air, nitrogen, or methane is shown. Compressor 51 qeneraZlv includes a first double acting piston 52 and comnression cylinder 53 which initially compress the qaseous substances not shown , as will be hereinafter described a second double acting piston 54 and compression cylinder 55 which provide the second stage of compression, as will be hereinafter described and a hydraulic power piston 56 and cylinder 57, which power piston 56 and cylinder 57 are disposed between the first and second doubleacting pistons 52, 54 and cylinders 53, 55. As seen in FIG. 1, the first and second double acting pistons 52, 54 and the hydraulic power piston 56 are each mounted upon a common elongate piston rod 58, wherebv the longitudinal axes of the cylinders 53, 55, 57, are aligned axially. The foregoing described components of compressor 51 may be manufactured of any suitable material having the requisite strength characteristics however, for ease of assembly and economy in manufacture, cylinders 53, 55, and 57 are preferably manufactured from commercially available drawn over mandrel steel tubing, which is readily and economically available.As is customary in the design of twostave compressors, the diameter of the second compression cylinder 55 is smaller than that of the first compression cylinder 53, in order to provide for the second stage of compression of the gaseous substance. Of course, if desired, the diameter of the second compression cylinder 55 could be the same as the diameter of the first compression cylinder 53, in order to provide a one stage compressor.Suitable piping connections would be provided whereby the inlet gaseous substance enters both cylinders simultaneously via a common inlet manifold and the compressed gas exits into a common discharge manifold into the coolinq means to be hereinafter described. Likewise, by use of steeple design cylinders, up to four stages of compression could be obtained. Still with reference to FIG. 1, it is seen that compressor 51 of the Present invention also aeneralZv includes first piping 59 for ease of illustration, shown in dotted lines for transferring compressed qas from the first piston and compression cylinder r2, 53 to the second piston and compression cylinder 54, 55.Second piping 60 also shown in dotted lines for ease of illustration is provided for transferring compressed gas frCn the second piston and compression cylinder 54, 55 to an exit orifice, shown generally at f i. Tt should be understood that upon the gaseous substance being compressed and elevated to an increased pressure, the gaseous substance exiting compressor 51 at exit orifice 61 may be piped to whatever location and or use is desired, such as a storage tank, or pipe line, etc. With reference to FIG. 1, it is seen that there are first and second cooling coils 62, 63 associated with the first and second piping 59, 60 for cooling the compressed gaseous substance. As seen in FIC. 1, first coolina coil, or intercooler, 62 is disposed intermediate the ends of first piping SQ, and the second cooling coils, or aftercooler, 63 is disposed intermediate the ends of second piping 60. Compressor 51 is further provided with a means for forcina 64 air to flow over the first and second coolina coils 62, 63. Preferablv the means for forcing air 64 includes a plurality of fan blades 65, which are rotated by a hydraulic motor 66.Of course, additional cooling coils could be provided, if necessary, as well as a thermostat to control the operation of the fan dependent upon ambient temperatures. As seen in FIG. 1, the first and second pistons and compression cylinders 52 55, power piston and cylinder 56, 57, first and second piping 59, 60, first and second cooling coils 62, 63, and air forcing means 64 are preferably disposed within an air cooling duct 67, which extends the lenath of compressor 51.Air cooling duct A7 may be manufactured of any suitable material, such as sheet metal, and may have any suitable cross sectional configuration, such as circular, U shaped or square, etc. , so lono as it serves to confine the air flow generated by air forcing means 64 to Dass across coo inq coils 62 and 63 and the other components of compressor 51. Should any leaks develop in compressor 51, the constant air flow from fan blades 65 will exhaust any accumulation of gas. Air coo3inq duct 67 also serves the function of protecting the various components of compressor 51 from the elements and adverse environmental conditions. Thus, upon hydraulic fluid being supplied to hydraulic motor 66 of air forcing means 64, fan blades 65 will be caused to rotate and will suck air into air coolinq duct 67, which air will pass over cooling coils 62 and 63, as well as pass from right to left as shown in FIG. 1, down air cooling duct 67 over all of the other components of compressor 53.Thus, as gas which has been compressed in the first staqe piston and compression cylinder 2, 53 passes down piping 59 to intercooler 62, air flow from fan blades 65 will dissipate the heat in the gas caused by its compression thereof as the gas flows through intercooler 67 and aftercooler 63. A cooling coil for the hydraulic oil may also be installed in air coolina duct 67 to reduce the hydrau ic oil operatina temperature if required. With reference to FIST. 1 and 2, it is seen that compressor 51 is provided with cooling chambers 68, 69. Cooling chamber 68, with particular reference to FIG. 2, is disposed between first stage piston and cylinder 52, 53 and hydraulic power piston and cylinder 56, 57 and cooling chamber 69 is disposed between hydraulic power piston and cylinder 56, 57 and second stage piston and cylinder 54, 55. The coolinq chambers 68, 69 each surround a portion of piston rod 58 and include means for directing to air flow, from the means for forcing air 64, over piston rod 58. Preferably, the means for directing air flow 70 camprises a pipe elbow, or duct, 71, which directs air from fan blades 65 to flow inwardly into cooling chambers 68 and 69. Cooling chambers 68, 69 each have suitable openings not shown to allow the air from ducts 71 to be vented out of the cooling chambers 68, 69. Thus, additional heat generated during operation of compressor 51 niay be dissipated via convection in cooling chambers 68, 69. till with reference to FIGS. 1 and 2, it is seen that each cylinder 53, 55 and 57, is provided with first and second cylinder header members. First stage cylinder 53 is provided with first and second header members 72, 73 hydraulic cylinder 57 is provided with first and second header members 74, 75 and second stage compression cvlinder 55 is provided with first and second header members 76, 77. Each set of header members and compression cylinders 72, 73, 53 74, 75, 57 and 76, 77, and 55, are held together by a plurality of elongate tie rods not shown for clarity of illustration purposes whereby the various components of compressor 51 may he readily assembled and disassembled for servicing. As shown in detail in FIG. 2, each cylinder end is sealed against its respective header members by an O ring seal 50 which contacts the inner surface of each cylinder. Accordinqly, the amount of surface area of each header member upon which gas pressure acts upon is reduced, whereby the stresses on the connecting tie rods for each set of header members is likewise reduced. with reference to FIGS 1 and 2, it is seen that cooling chambers 68, 69 are formed by an outer housing member 78, 78 and header members 79, 79 . Housings 7R, 78 may have any cross sectional confiquration however, housing members 78, 7E preferably have a circular cross sectional confiquration. Housing member 78 is received into header member 73 as by groove 80, as seen in FIG. 2, and is received into header member 79 as shown at 81. The construction of housing member 78 and header member 79 is the same as that previously described for housing member 78 and header member 79. Further with reference to FIGS. 1 and 2, it is seen that header members 79, 79 are attached to header members 74, 75 of power cylinder 57, as by a pluralitv of bolts, or tie rods, 82. Still with reference to FIGS. 1 and 2, it is seen that all the previously described components of compressor 51 are disposed uton a mounting plate 83 which rests upon the earth s surface 84 or any other suitable structure, such as a portable skid.Air forcing means 64 is fixedly secured to mountingPlate 83 as hy a vertical brace 85, and cooling coils 62, 63 are provided with any suitable base members 86 which are secured to mounting plate 83 in any conventional manner. The first stage piston and cylinder 52, 53, second stage piston and cylinder 54, 55, and the hydraulic power piston and cylinder 56, 57 are disposed on mounting plate 83 via two bolts 87, 88 which pass through depending flanges 89, 90 affixed to housing members 78, 78 of cooling chambers 68, 69, which flanges 89, 90 are received in mounting lugs 91 and 92 secured to mounting plate 83.Accordingly, the foregoing compressor components of compressor 51 have a two point mounting system, whereby transmission of stress forces to the compression cylinders 53, 55 and power cylinder 57 from the mounting plate 83 is greatly minimized. This two Point mounting system allows a certain amount of f exinq and movement between the various components of compressor 51, which is not fetrimental to the operation of compressor 51, and provides for a verv simple, economical, and efficient system for mounting the various components of compressor 53 to mounting plate 83. As shown in FIG. 1, and particularly inFIG. 2, both the first stage cylinder 53 and second stage cvlinder 55 are sealed where piston rod 58 enters cylinders 53 and 55. A rod packing 93 is provided in header member 73, and an identical rod packing 94 is provided in header member 76. Header members 73 and 76 are each provided with a lubrication connection passageway, or duct 95, 96 which are in fluid transmitting relationship to rod packings 93 and 94 to lubricate the packings 93and 94 and the packing housing which also support the piston rod 58. vhe transmission of the hydraulic, lubrication fluid through ducts 95, 9 will be hereinafter described with reference to FIG. 3. With reference to FI. 1, the construction of the first and second stage pistons 52, and 54 will be describe. Pistons 52 and 54 are sealed against the interior surface of cylinders 53, 55 by a plurality of polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE piston rings 97 which are mounted in a plurality of groove 98 formed in the outer surface of pistons 52, 54.The PTFE rings 97 support pistons 52 and 54 within cylinders 53, 55, whereby the outer surface of pistons 52, 54 do not contact the interior surface of cylinders 53, 55. Accordingly, pistons 52 and 54 may be reciprocated within the cylinders 53, 55 without any lubrication being provided to cylinders 53, 55.If compressor 51 is being utilized to compress and elevate the pressure of certain types of wet gaseous substances, wherein lubrication is desired within the first and second stage pistons and cylinder 52 55, hydraulic lubricating oil can be provided via lubrication connections 99 for cylinder 53 and 100 for cylinder 55. Suitable piping not shown is provided for transmitting the hydraulic fluid to the lubrication connections 99, 100, as wiRl he hereinafter described with regard to FIG. 3. An important safety feature of the present invention is that pistons 52, 54 are fixedly secured to piston rod 58 as by a threaded connection 101 for ease of description, the threaded connection for piston 52 is illustrated and it is identical to that utilized for piston 54 . Peferably, threaded connection 101 has a first thread direction, preferably as by right hand threads. A locking member, or socket head cap screw, 102 is threadedly received into the outer surface of piston 52 until it engaqes the end of piston rod 58. Locking member 102 is threaded through piston 52 into piston rod 58 in a second opposite direction. Locking member 102 and its mating surface in piston 52 is preferably provided with left hand threads.Accordingly, the oossihi itv of the pistons 52, 54 becoming disenqaqed from piston rod 58 from vibrational forces is greatly reduced. Since severe damage to compressor 51 and or personnel in the vicinity of compressor 53 can result when a piston comes loose from Diston rod 58, the safety aspects of compressor 51 are greatly enhanced. Hydraulic power piston 56 is likewise provided with suitable seals 103 disposed in grooves in the outer surface of piston 56, in a manner similar to pistons 52 and 54. It should be noted that if no lubrication fluid is fed through lubrication connections 95 and 96 for piston rod packing 93 and 94, adequate lubrication oil will be supplied by hydraulic fluid left on piston rod 58 as piston rod 58 reciprocates past the seals 104 for power cylinder 57 disposed in header members 74 and 75. With reference to FIGS. 1 and 2, the piping and valving connections for the hydraulic fluid not shown of compressor 51 will be described. Hydraulic power piston and cylinder 56, 57 are provided with hydraulic fluid feed and discharge ports lllFi discosed in power cylinder header members 74, 75. Pall check valves 106 and 107 are aiternately opened upon power piston 56 being recipronated within cylinder 57. With particular reference to p. 2, it is seen that power piston 56 includes tubular camminq members 108 and 108 disposed on either side of piston 56. As piston 56 reciprocates within cylinder 57, camming member 108 will engage and open cam operated, spring loaded ball check valve 106, and camming member 108 will likewise engage and open the other check valve 107, as will be hereinafter described in greater detail. The opening of the cam operated check valves 106, 107 create a pressure differential to reciprocate pilot valve 133 to be hereinafter described. With reference to FIGS. 1 and 4, the flow diagram for the gaseous substance to be compressed will be described in greater detail. The gaseous substance to be compressed, which may come from a wellhead, storage tank, etc., may first pass through a conventional, optional scrubber unit 109, as seen in FIG. 4. Frcm the scrubber unit 109, the gas passes via piping shown schematically as 110 inFTC,. 4 into the first compressor stage cylinder 53 via inlet manifold 111, which distributes the gas throuah piping 112 to two inlet ball check valves 113, 1 4 disposed in header members 72, 74. weciDrocation of hydraulic power piston 56, as will be hereinafter described, causes piston 52 to reciprocate within first stage cylinder 53 which alternately sucks gas throuah inlet check valves 113, 114 and compresses the gas within cylinder 53 on both sides of piston 52. The compressed gas is then discharqed from first cylinder 53 through discharge check valves 115, 116 which are likewise mounted in header members 72, 73. Discharge check valves 115, 116 feed into piping 117 into discharge manifold 118 and into first piping 59 as previously described. The compressed gas then passes through intercooler 62 through first piping 59 into another optional scrubber unit lln as shown in FIG. .It should be noted that optional scrubber units 109 and 119 would he disposed outside of air cooling duct 67 and would be provided with suitable, conventional piping connections. After the gas has been first compressed into the first stage, cooled, and then optionally scrubbed, it passes through first pipina 59 into the second stage inlet manifold 120, through piping 121, and past second inlet ball check valves 122, 123 and the gas is compressed within the second stave cylinder 55 in the same manner as occured in the first stage cylinder 53.The gas is then discharged through second stage discharge check valves 124, 125 into piping 126 and discharge manifold 127. The compressed gas then passes through second piping 60 into aftercooler 63 and to exit orifice 61, as previously described. It should be noted that at least one of the compression cylinders 53, 55 may be provided with a clearance bottle 129 which may be associated with a pipetapped opening as at 128 in header 77, whereby the clearance volume of second stage compressor cylinder 55 is variable to provide for balancing compression ratios between the first and second compression cylinders 53, 55.It should be noted that header 72 of the first stage compression cylinder 53 may likewise be provided with a similar pipe tapped opening such as 128, with a similar clearance bottle 120, mumping now to FIG. 3, the hydraulic control and power svstem for compressor 51 will be described. It should first be noted that the components to be hereinafter described, with the exception of the hydraulic power piston and cylinder 56, 57, may be disposed within air cooling duct 67 if space permits, or may be disposed adjacent to compressor 51 on any suitable base member or skid.In general, the hydraulic control and power system 103 includes the following components a variable displacement hydraulic pump 131 a shuttle valve 132 cam operated, spring loaded check valves 106, 107, as previously described hydraulic power piston and cylinder 56, 57, as previously described pilot valve 133 hvdraulic fluid reservoir 134 flow control valves 135, 136, operatively associated with each end of shuttle valve 132 needle valves 137140 ball check valve 141 manual bypass valve 142 relief valve 143t bladder accumulator 144 pressure compensated contra valves 145, 146 a hydraulic distribution block 147 hydraulic feed ports 105, as previous v described hydraulic fluid filters 148, 149 bladder accumulator 156 and back pressure control valve 157. Hvdraulic fluid piping as shown throughout FIG. 3 is further provided which operatively associates pump 131, shuttle valve 132, check valves 106, 107, pilot valve 133, resevoir 134, and the other components of hydraulic control and power system 130 to each others as will be hereinafter described in greater detail. Hydraulic oil 150 is stored in reservoir 134 and is drawn into the variable displacement hydraulic pump 131 through suction screen 148 and piping 151 upon the actuation or starting of pump 131. Suction screen 148 serves to prevent any impurities from entering the hydrau ic control and power system 130. Pump 131 is controlled via a control siqnal 142 being applied to pump actuator head 53. Pump 13 is initially destroked to zero flow bv venting the control signal 152 operating on actuator head 153.After a period of warm up time, the control signal 152 is restored to pump actuator head 153, and pump 131. increases in stroke in response to the increasing control signal on actuator head 15. Accordingly, flow of hydraulic fluid 150 through system 130 commences and the pressure of the hydraulic fluid 150 throughout system 130 increases to the necessary pressure to overcome the pressure loads on the first stage and second stage pistons 52, 54 due to the presence of a gaseous substance within compression cylinders 53, 55.It should be noted that by increasing the control, or pressure, signal 152 to pump actuator head 153, presence the flow of hydraulic fluid throughout the hydraulic control and power system 130 is increased, which in turn increases the cyclinq, or reciprocation, speed of power piston 56. grhis increased speed in turn increases the capacity, or ability, of compressor 51 to compress increased volumes of inlet gas with an associated increase in reauired horsepower.Likewise, by decreasina the pressure, or contro signal, 152 upon pump actuator head 153 the speed of the hvdraulic control and power system 130 is slowed down, which in turn allows compressor 51 to slow down to acccirmnodate decreased volumes, or a lower capacity, of incoming gas with an associated increase in required horsepower. Accordingly, the hydraulic control and power system 130 of the present invention allows compressor 51 to operate over an infinitely variable speed range to provide infinitely variable capacity control of compressor 51. If the incoming flow and pressure conditions into the first stage compressor cylinder 53 vary, it is merely necessary to change the control signal to the variable disp .acement pump 131 in order to compensate for the changing incoming pressure and flow conditions of the gaseous substance. The power source for variable displacement pump 131 may be of anv conventional tvpe, including a constant speed electric motor, a reciprocating engine, or any other suitab e rotating power source. Tt should be understood that with a variable displacement pump, the power source speed can remain constant and its horsepower requirements to operate the pump vary proportionately with the flow of the pump.Thus, when compressor 51 operates upon gas flowing under decreased flow conditions, e.g., a lower capacity, energy is conserved because the horsepower requirements from the power source are likewise proportionately decreased. Still with reference to FIG. 3, it is seen that hydraulic fluid 150 exits from variable displacement pump 131 from its exit orifice as shown at 154 and passes through ball check valve 141, or other suitable valve. Ball check valve 141 prevents hydraulic fluid pressure backing up upon pump 131 and from reversing the hydraulic fluid flow and drainina the hydraulic fluid 150 in the pump 131 when pump 131 is turned off. It should be noted that pressure relief va ve 143, is of conventional manufacture and Protects all the hydraulic comnonents of system 130 from an excessive pressure build up within the hydraulic piping or compression cylinders 53, 55, whereby such excessive pressure build ups may he safely relieved through relief valve 143.Additionally, pressure relief valve 143 allows compression cylinders 53 and 55 to have liquid substances pass therethrough without damage to the compression cylinders 53, 55. It is not unusual for a compressor working upon well head natural gas to have liquids from the wellhead flowing in the gas stream. This situation is commonly called liquid slugging , and such liquid sluqs flowing in a gas stream into a compressor can cause serious damage to the compressor cylinders due to the increased pressure build un when such liquid slags enter the compression cylinders. As seen in FIG. 3, hydraulic system pressure acts upon the cam operated, spring loaded check valves 106, 107 across needle valves 137, 138, whereby check valves 106 and 107 are normally maintairMed in a closed position until opened by tubular cammina members 108, 108 . Hydraulic power piston 56 moves to the right toward ball check valve 107 until the camminq member 108 opens ball check valve 107 to release the hydraulic fluid pressure through hydraulic fluid feed port 105 and header member 75. The opening of ball check valve 107 thus vents the hydraulic fluid at the end of pilot valve 133 to the reservoir 134 via piping 155.The venting of hydraulic fluid previously described creates a pressure differential across four way pilot valve 133 and thus strokes it to apply system pressure to the opposite end of the four way shuttle valve 132. Simultaneously therewith, the formerly pressurized end of the shuttle valve 132 is vented through the pilot valve 133 to the reservoir 134, as shown in FIG. 3 hue shifting of the shuttle valve 132 causes hydraulic fluid 150 to be alternately applied to, and exhausted from, the hydraulic fluid feed ports 05 in headers 74, 75, which cause power piston 56 to reciprocate within cylinder 57.Flow control valves 135 and 136 control the speed at which the shuttle valve 132 moves by throttling the hydraulic fluid 150 flowing from the pilot valve 133 to the ends of the shuttle valve 132, whereby hydraulic shocks, caused by the switching of the shuttle valve 132 too quicly are dampened. It should be noted that flow control valves similar to valves 135, 136 could also be operatively associated with the ends of pilot valve 133 to further control the switching response of the hydraulic components of svstem 131 . It should be noted that pilot valve 133, shuttle valve 132, and flow control valves 135, 136 are conventional, commercially available valves. Oil exhausted from four way shuttle valve 132 is discharged in a pulsating manner.These pulsations which could be harmful to the hydraulic system comPonents are effectively dampened using accumulator 15tri in association with back pressure control valve 147 assurina lonq system component life. Four way pilot valve 133 incorporates a mechanic3 latching mechanism or detent which locks the pilot valve spool 133 in position when system flow is interrupted. Without this feature, the pilot va ve spool 3 33 could seek a neutral position in the valve body so that compressor 51 could not be started. Still with reference to FIG. 3, it is seen that pressure compensated control valve 146 may also be operatively associated with pump 131 to meter hydraulic fluid 150 to distribution block 147.Distribution block 147 thus meters exact volumes of hydraulic fluid 150, if desired, to the first and second stage cylinder lubrication connections 99, 100, and to the rod packinq lubrications 95, 96.Manual bvpass valve 142 may be provided to manually unload the pressure in pump 131. if desired. Bladder accumulator 144 mav be also operatively associated with pump 13 and svstem 130 to reduce system pulsations or pressure shocks when the shuttle valve 3 32 switches. RladAer accumulator 144 also serves the function of storing and conserving hydraulic energy within svstem 130 when switching of shuttle valve 132 occurs. As previously described, the motor 66 for fan blade 65 is hydraulical. y operated, and its speed is controlled by a pressure compensated flow control valve 145. Once valve 145 is set to the desired pressure rating, the speed of fan motdr 66, and in turn the rotation of the fan blades 65 will remain constant even though there are hydraulic system pressure changes in the system 130. In this regard, it should be noted that the fan speed can be varied by adjusting the pressure compensated control valve 145 in order to control varyina temperature conditions caused by increased ambient temperature conditions at the ovation of compressor 51, or from increased temperature conditions caused by the incoming gaseous substance into compressor 51. Each of the ball check valves 1.06 and 107 and fluid control valves 135 and 136 may be c perativeiy associated with needle valves 137 140 for varvina the flow to such valves to vary the response time of such valves. It should be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that two compressors 51 of the present invention could be connected in series, one along side each other with wuitahl.e piping connections there between, to provide a four stage compressor. FIG. 5 shows an embodiment similar to that elE FIG. 3, with a somewhat fine design. In this eBnbodiment, filter 149 is provided in the suctionLine in Place of return filter 149 of the FIG. 3 embodiment. Filter 1.49 filters minute particles before they enter the pumps 131, thereby increasing plump life. Also in FIG. 5, a pressure regulation valve 1559 is provided as part of the hydraulic control and power system 130, and check valves 160, 161 are instalJ ed in the control feed lines to the check valves 106, 107 to prevent counterflow and pressure surges in the control system when the main shuttle valve 132 shuttles the main oil flow to port 105 in the main power cylinder 156. Regulated hydraulic control system and pressure provided by the pressure regulator 159 acts upon the cam operated spring loaded check valves 106, 107 plus needle valves 137, 138, whereby check valves 106, 107 are normally maintained in a closed position until opened by tubular camming members 108, 108 . The motor 66 for fan blade 65 has its speed control by pressure regulator 159, which also controls the control system pilot pressure. Once that pressure regulating valve 159 is set to the desired Pressure rating, the speed of the fan motor 66 will remain constant even though there are hydraulic system pressure changes in the system 3 3n. By adjusting the pressure regulating valve lQa, the fan speed can he varied. It is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the exact details of construction, operation, exact materials, or embodiment shown and described, as obvious modifications and equivalents will be apparent to one skilled in the art for example, the intercooler and after cooler and air forcing means could be utilized as a separate, skidmounted unit, of a larger size should additional cooling of the compressed gas be necessary,Accordingly, the invention is therefore to be limited only by the scope of the appended claims.
