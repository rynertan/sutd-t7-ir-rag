# Weldable coating compositions.

## Abstract
Weldable coatings containing an electroconductive pig ment such as zinc, an epoxy resin binder and solvent are improved by employing as the epoxy resin binder, the reac tion product of a relatively low molecular weight epoxy resin such as the diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A and an amine compound having two amine hydrogen atoms such as ethanolamine.
