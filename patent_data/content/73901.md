# METHOD FOR EVALUATING BOOLEAN EXPRESSIONS IN A DATA PROCESSING SYSTEM

## Abstract
A method for evaluating boolean expressions in a data processing system includes steps of forming a first vector for selecting and conditioning the boolean variables prior to their evaluation and forming a second vector for specifying logical AND and OR operations in the normal form of the boolean expression. Evaluation of the boolean expression is then performed by translating the first vector using the boolean variables as a translate table. The result of the translation is logically combined with the second vector using an exclusive OR function. The result of the exclusive OR operation is translated with and upon itself and the state of the last position of the result of this translation is the result of the evaluation of the boolean expression.
