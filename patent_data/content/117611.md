# APPARATUS FOR DETECTING A STEERING ANGLE AND A STEERING ANGULAR VELOCITY OF A VEHICLE

## Abstract
An apparatus for detecting a steering angle and a steering angular velocity of a steering system mounted in a vehicle. The apparatus has a sensor 16 mounted with respect to a steering column tube 18 on a lower steering column tube 20 secured to the lower end of the tube 18 coaxially therewith and a disc 14 secured onto the outer periphery of a steering shaft 12 . The steering sensor has a projecting form in which a light emitting element 160 and a light receiving element 162 are provided. The projecting form of the sensor is designed so as to prevent the light emitting element 160 and the light receiving element 162 from contacting the disc 14 .
