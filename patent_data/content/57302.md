## Description
This invention relates to a rubber and plastics covered cable cross linking device. Heretofore, a cross linking device having a high pressure steam heating section and a high pressure liquid cooling section has been commonly employed to subject a rubber and plastics covered power cable to cross linking.However, recently a so called dry cross linking device requiring no high pressure steam has been extensively employed in order to 1 increase the cable manufacturing speed, and 2 prevent the formation of voids which were produced by high pressure steam thereby to improve the quality of the manufactured cable. A radiation heating type cross linking device has been extensively employed as a typical example of the dry cross linking device. An example of a radiation heating type cross linking apparatus is shown in Figure 1. InFigure 1, reference numeral 1 designates a conductor supplying device, 2 an extruding device for extruding a cross linkable rubber plastic insulator containing a cross linking agent, 3 a cross linking device, 31 a radiation heating section using heat rays, 32 a cooling section, 4 a winding device for winding completed crosslinked cable core, 5 and 6 guide rollers, W1 a conductor, and W2 a cable core.In the radiation heating section 31, a rubber and plastics covered power cable running through a cross linking tube which is heated to 300 to S300C by an electrical device or by a high temperature oil jacket is heated to SO to 3504C by heat from the cross linking tube so as to be cross linked. The power cable thus heated is then cooled to 50 to 350C by the cooling section 31. In such a radiation heating type cross linking device, no high pressure steam is employed in the heating section and therefore the cable is free from voids the formation of which is attributed to the steam and the treated cable is high in quality.One of the features of the radiation heating device is that the temperature of the heating section and the pressure of an inert coolant gas can be individually controlled. Because of this feature, it is possible to increase the temperature of the heatin . ection to a high temperature, 300 to 5504C as described above, which improves the cross linking rate and the manufacturing rate. A gas cooling system has been proposed as the cooling system in the above described radiation heating cross linking device. Fig. 2 is a sectional view of an example of the radiation heating cross linking device employing a gas cooling system. As shown in Fig. 2, a crss linking fube 3 includes a radiation heating section 31, a gas cooling section 32, and a sealing section 33. The sealing section 33 includes packings 33a, 33b and 33c. An inert. gas such as nitrogen at a pressure of 2 to 20 kg cm2 is circulated at a flow rate of 1 to 30 Nm3 min in the radiation heating section 31 and the gas cooling section 32 to cool cross linked rubber and plastic covered power cable to a predetermined temperature 50 to 9500 . The length of the cooling section should be determined from the desired cable manufacturing rate, the diameter of the cable to be cooled and the heating temperature employed.However, the provision of a lengthy cooling section is not economical and therefore the length of the cooling section is preferably selected to a certain value by taking various conditions into account. In the case where the gas cooling system is employed, if for instance the conductor feeding speed is increased, the cable is not sufficiently cooled to the predetermined temperature 50 to 9500 . That is, the cable passes through the sealing section with its surface cooled only to 70 to 11000 as a result of which the cable surface may be scratched or deformed. An object of the invention is to provide a crosslinking device in which the above described difficulties accompanYing conventional cross linking devices have been eliminated or reduced. Accordingly, the invention resides in a rubber and plastics covered cable cross linking device having a cross linking tube comprising a radiation heating section and a gas cooling section, characterised in that the cross linking tube 3 also includes a liquid cooling section 33 provided in a sealing section disposed at the downstream end of the cross linking tube 3. In the accompanying drawings, Figure 1 is an explanatory diagram showing an example of a prior art radiation heating type cross linking device Figure 2 is a sectional view of a cross linking tube of a cross linking device of the type shown in Figure 1 using a gas cooling system and Figure 3 is a sectional view of a cross linking tube of a cross linking device according to one example of the invention. Referring to Figure 3, those components which have been previously described with reference to Figure 2 are similarly numbered in Figure 3. In the cross linking device of said one example of the invention, a liquid is sealed or circulated under pressure in a sealing section 33 which includes packings 33a, 33b and 33c and which is disposed at the downstream end of the tube 3.The liquid in the sealing section 33 not only facilitates the cooling of the surface layer of a cable running through the cross linking tube 3 but also serves as a lubricant to decrease the friction between the cable surface and the packing. Examples of suitable liquids are water, silicon oil and special molten metal salt solution. The liquid is sealed or circulated in the sealing section 33 under a pressure greater than atmospheric pressure and equal to or lower than the gas pressure in the gas cooling section 32. In the cross linking device of said one example, the gas and the liquid used in combination provide a high cooling efficiency. Therefore, the device has an advantageous cooling effect. As the liquid is sealed or circulated in the sealing section 33, the liquid serves as a lubricant between the packings and the cable surface layer to protect the cable surface from being scratched.
