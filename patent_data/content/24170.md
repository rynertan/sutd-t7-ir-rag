# Process for preparation of semiconductors and semiconductor photoelectrodes and cells containing them.

## Abstract
Process for forming semiconductors, for instance for use in solid state and PEC cells as a photoelectrode, which com prises preparing a slurry of at least one semiconductor start ing material, a flux and a liquid vehicle, applying a layer of the slurry to an electrically conductive substrate, and annealing the layer. The semiconductor produced by the process and a photo electrochemical cell including the semiconductor are also described.
