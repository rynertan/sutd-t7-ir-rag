# Method for steering a steerable vehicle along a guide line marking.

## Abstract
In steering a wheeled vehicle along a path L marked on the supporting surface, a single linear detector D is used which is rigidly mounted in the vehicle perpendicular to the principal direction of movement of the vehicle. As the vehicle moves, the position of the path L in the transverse field of view of the detector D is measured repeatedly, in the form of lateral deviations Δx , simultaneously with the distances s₁, s₂ ... in the direction of movement between successive lateral deviation measurements. The deviation between the direction of the path L marked and the path T actually travelled by the vehicle is thus obtained, in the form of a lateral deviation Δx , and an attitude deviation Δx₂ Δx₁ s₁ . These two deviation variables will make possible corrective steering of the vehicle to the marked path L .
