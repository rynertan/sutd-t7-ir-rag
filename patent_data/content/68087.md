# Boatless evaporation method.

## Abstract
The method and apparatus for coating workpieces 16 with a material involves boatless evaporation of the end of a wire or rod 12 made of said material. The end of the wire is heated by a radiant or inductive heater 14 to form a molten convex meniscus 13 thereon which serves as the coating source in the vacuum chamber 23 .
