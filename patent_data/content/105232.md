# Strut suspension for an automotive vehicle.

## Abstract
A shock absorbing strut suspension for an automotive vehicle includes a disc spring 62 between the strut 22 and the vehicle body. The disc spring is preloaded upon assembly in the vehicle so that it readily absorbs small amplitude vibra tions while transmitting larger amplitude vibrations. The disc spring thus augments the effect of elastic dampers 56 designed to absorb high frequency, relative low amplitude vibrations.
