## Description
LIPOXYGENASE INHIBITORS This invention is directed to a series of benzofuran and benzothiophene compounds, especially useful as inhibitors of the mammalian 5 lipoxygenase enzyme system. The 5 lipoxygenase enzyme controls the biosynthesis of the class of compounds known as leukotrienes. Inhibition of the 5 lipoxygenase enzyme therefore prevents or diminishes the adverse effects of the leukotrienes in a mammalian subject. The leukotrienes are a novel group of biologically active mediators derived from arachidonic acid through the action of the 5 lipoxygenase enzyme system. The leukotrienes play an important role in inducing allergic reactions, such as asthma, allergic bronchitis or allergic rhinitis in man. One of the leukotrienes B4 contributes to both inflammation and allergic reactions in man. There are two groups of leukotrienes derived from a common unstable precursor, Leukotriene A4.The first of these are the peptido lipid leukotrienes, the most important being Leukotrienes C4 and D4.These compounds collectively account for the biologically active materials known as the slow reacting substances of anaphylaxis. They are potent smooth muscle contracting agents, particularly on respiratory smooth muscle but also on other tissues e.g., gall bladder . In addition, they promote mucous production, modulate vascular permeability changes and are potent inflammatory agents in human skin. The most important compound in the second group of leukotrienes is Leukotriene B4, a dihydroxy fatty acid derived from Leukotriene A4.This compound is a potent chemotactic agent for neutrophils and eosinophils. When injected in vivo, in addition to promoting the accumulation of leukocytes, Leukotriene B4 is also a potent hyperalgesic agent and can modulate vascular permeability changes through a neutrophil dependent mechanism. Both groups of leukotrienes are formed following oxygenation of arachidonic acid through the action of the 5 lipoxygenase enzyme. See D. Bailey and F. Casey,Ann. Rpts. Med. Chem. 17 203 1982 . Leukotrienes can also mediate other diseases.These include psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, gouty arthritis and gall bladder spasms. In addition, they may have a role in cardiovascular disease becauseLeukotrienes C4 and D4 act as coronary and cerebral arterial vasoconstrictors and these compounds may also have negative inotropic effects on the myocardium. In addition, the Leukotrienes are important mediators of inflammatory diseases through their ability to modulate leukocyte and lymphocyte function. See B. Samuelsson, Science 220 568 1983 . Benzo b furan derivatives having the formula EMI3.1 especially wherein R1 is alkyl, OH, N R 2 or alkyl N R 2 R2 is lower alkyl and R3 is alkyl, are known compounds.

The compounds of Formula I are active as inhibitors of the biosynthesis of both leukotrieneB4, as well as leukotrienes C4, D4, B4 andF4, the active elements of slow reacting substance of anaphylaxis SRS A . This inhibition of the biosynthesis of leukotrienes indicates that the compositions are useful to treat, prevent or ameliorate, in mammals and especially in humans, pulmonary conditions including diseases such as asthma and allergies and allergic reactions such as allergic rhinitis, contact dermatitis, and allergic conjunctivitis. These compounds are also useful in mammals, especially in humans, as anti inflammatory and analgesic agents and in the treatment of skin diseases, such as psoriasis and in the treatment of cardiovascular conditions, such as angina and as cytoprotective agents. The cytoprotective activity of a compound may be observed in both animals and man by noting the increased resistance of the gastrointestinal mucosa to the noxious effects of strong irritants, for example, the ulcerogenic effects of aspirin or indomethacin. In addition to lessening the effect of non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs on the gastrointestinal tract, animal studies show that cytoprotective compounds will prevent gastric lesions induced by oral administration of strong acids, strong bases, ethanol, hypertonic saline solutions and the like. Two assays can be used to measure cytoprotective ability. These assays are A an ethanolinduced gastric ulcer assay and B an indomethacin induced ulcer assay. A. Ethanol Induced Gastric Ulcer Twenty four hour fasted Sprague Dawley S.D. rats are perorally p.o. dosed with 1.0 ml absolute ethanol. Fifteen minutes prior to ethanol administration, groups of rats each receive either an aqueous vehicle aqueous methylcellulose 5 wt. or the test compound at various doses perorally. One hour later, the animals are sacrificed and stomach mucosae are examined for resulting lesions. B. Indomethacin Induced Ulcer Assay Indomethacin, 10 mg kg p.o., is used to induce ulcers in 24 hour fasted S.D. rats. Fifteen minutes prior to indomethacin administration, groups of rats each receive either an aqueous vehicle 5 by weight methylcellulose or the test compound at various doses perorally. Four hours later the animals are sacrificed and stomach mucosae are examined for resulting ulcers. The magnitude of a prophylactic or therapeutic dose of a compound of formula I will, of course, vary with the nature of the severity of the condition to be treated and with the particular compound of formula I and its route of administration.In general, the daily dose range for anti asthmatic, anti allergic or anti inflammatory use and, generally uses other than cytoprotection, lies within the range of from about 10 pg to about 20 mg per kg body weight of a mammal, preferably from about 50 ijg to about 20 mg per kg of body weight of a mammal, and most preferably from about 100 vg to about 10 mg per kg of body weight of a mammal. The exact amount of a compound of theFormula I to be used as a cytoprotective agent will depend on, inter alia, whether it is being administered to heal damaged cells or to avoid future damage, on the nature of the damaged cells e.g., gastro intestinal ulcerations vs. nephrotic necrosis , and on the nature of the causative agent.An example of the use of a compound of the Formula I in avoiding future damage would be co administration of a compound of the Formula I with a non steroidal anti inflammatory drug for example, indomethacin that might otherwise cause such damage. For such use, the compound of Formula I is administered from 30 minutes prior up to 30 minutes after administration of the NSAID. Preferably, it is administered prior to or simultaneously with theNSAID e.g. as a combination dosage form . The effective daily dosage level for compounds of Formula I inducing cytoprotection in mammals, especially humans, will generally range from about 0.002 mg kg to about 100 mg kg, preferably from about 0.02 mg kg to about 30 mg kg. The dosage may be administered in single or divided individual doses. Any suitable route of administration may be employed for providing a mammal, especially a human with an effective dosage of a leukotriene antagonist. For example, oral, rectal, transdermal, parenteral, intramuscular, intravenous and the like may be employed. Dosage forms include tablets, troches, dispersions, suspensions, solutions, capsules and the like. The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention comprise a compound of formula I as an active ingredient or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and may also contain a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and optionally other therapeutic ingredients. The term pharmaceutically acceptable salts refers to salts prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non toxic bases including inorganic bases and organic bases. Salts derived frm inorganic bases include sodium, potassium, lithium, ammonium, calcium, magnesium, ferrous, zinc, copper, manganous, aluminum, ferric, manganic salts and the like. Particularly preferred are the ammonium, potassium, sodium, calcium and magnesium salts.Salts derived from pharmaceutically acceptable organic non toxic bases include salts of primary, secondary, and tertiary amines, substituted amines including naturally occurring substituted amines, cyclic amines and basic ion exchange resins, such as isopropylamine, trimethylamine, diethylamine, tr iethylamine, tripropylamine, ethanolamine, 2 dimethylaminoethanol, 2 diethylaminoethanol, tromethamine, lysine, arginine, histidine, caffeine, procaine, hydrabamine, choline, betaine, ethylenediamine, glucosamine, methylglucamine, theobromine, purines, piperazine, piperidine, N ethylpiperidine, polyamine resins and the like. The compositions include compositions suitable for oral, rectal, ophthalmic, pulmonary, nasal, dermal, topical or parenteral including subcutaneous, intramuscular and intravenous administration, although the most suitable route in any given case will depend on the nature and severity of the conditions being treated and on the nature of the active ingredient. They may be conveniently presented in unit dosage form and prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. For use where a composition for intravenous administration is employed, a suitable dosage range for anti asthmatic, anti inflammatory or anti allergic use is from about 0.01 to about 20 mg preferably from about 0.1 to about 10 mg of a compound of formula I per kg of body weight per day and for cytoprotective use from about 0.002 mg to about 100 mg preferably from about 0.02 mg to about 30 mg and more preferably from about 0.1 mg to about 10 mg of a compound of Formula I per kg of body weight per day.In the case where an oral composition is employed, a suitable dosage range for anti asthmatic, antiinflammatory or anti allergic use is, e.g. from about 1 to about 100 mg of a compound of formula I per kg of body weight per day, preferably from about 5 to about 40 mg per kg and for cytoprotective use from about 0.01 mg to about 30 mg preferably from about 0.1 mg to about 10 mg of a compound of FormulaI per kg of body weight per day. The topical application dosage forms include ointments, salves, controlled release patches, emulsions, solutions, thixotropic formulations, powders sprays and the like. For topical application, the percent by weight of the active ingredient Formula I compound may vary from about 0.001 to about 10 . For treating inflammation the mode of administration may be oral, parenteral, by suppository and the like. The various dosage forms are the same as those described above. For treating skin diseases such as psoriasis, atopic dermatitis and the like, oral topical or parenteral administration is useful. For topical application to the diseased area, salves, patches, controlled release patches, emulsions, etc., are convenient dosage forms. For use as an analgesic, i.e. for treating pain, any suitable mode of administration may be used, e.g., oral, parenteral, by insufflation, by suppository and the like. For treating cardiovascular conditions, such as angina pectoris, etc., any suitable mode of administration, e.g. oral, parenteral, topical, insufflation, etc. and dosage form e.g. pills, liquid formulations, controlled release capsules, controlled release skin patches, etc. may be used. For administration by inhalation, the compounds of the present invention are conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray presentation from pressurized packs or a nebuliser. The preferred composition for inhalation is a powder which may be formulated as a cartridge from which the powder composition may be inhaled with the aid of a suitable device. In the case of a pressurized aerosol, the dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. These inhalation formulations will range in dosage from about 0.1 pg to about 200 pug of a compound of FormulaI, administered as necessary to provide relief. In practical use, leukotriene antagonists ofFormula I can be combined as the active ingredient in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. The carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration, e.g., oral or intravenous. In preparing the compositions for oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed, such as, for example, water glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations, such as, for example, suspensions, elixirs and solutions or carriers such as starches, sugars, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of oral solid preparations such as, for example, powders, capsules and tablets.Because of their ease of administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit form, in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. If desired, tablets may be sugar coated or enteric coated by standard techniques. In addition to the common dosage forms set out above, the leukotriene antagonists of Formula I may also be administered by controlled release means and or delivery devices such as those described inU.S. Patent Nos. 3,845,770 3,916,899 3,536,809 3,598,123 3,630,200 and 4,008,719, the disclosure of whcih is hereby incorporated herein by reference. Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention suitable for oral administration and by inhalation in the case of asthma therapy may be presented as discrete units such as capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient, as a powder or granules or as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous liquid, a non aqueous liquid, an oil in water emulsion or a water in oil liquid emulsion. Such compositions may be prepared by any of the methods of pharmacy but all methods include the step of bringing into association the active ingredient with the carrier which constitutes one or more necessary ingredients. In general, the compositions are prepared by uniformly and intimately admixing the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired presentation.For example, a tablet may be prepared by compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine, the active ingredient in a free flowing form such as powder or granules, optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, lubricating, surface active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine, a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. Desirably, each tablet contains from about 25 mg to about 500 mg of the active ingredient and each cachet or capsule contains from about 25 to about 500 mg of the active ingredient. The following are examples of representative pharmaceutical dosage forms for the compounds ofFormula I Injectable Suspension mg ml Leukotriene inhibitor 2Methylcellulose 5.0Tween 80 0.5Benzyl alcohol 9.0Methyl paraben 1.8Propyl paraben 0.2Water for injection to a total volume of 10 mlTablet mg tabletLeukotriene inhibitor 25Microcrystalline Cellulose 415Povidone 14.0Pregelatinized Starch 43.5Magnesium Stearate 2.5 500Capsule mg capsuleLeukotriene inhibitor 25Lactose Powder 573.5Magnesium Stearate 1.5 600 In addition to the compounds of Formula I, the pharmaceutical compositions can also contain other active ingredients, such as cyclooxygenase inhibitors, non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs tNSAIDs , peripheral analgesic agents such as zomepirac, diflunisal and the like. The weight ratio of the compound of the Formula I to the second active ingredient may be varied and will depend upon the effective dose of each ingredient. Generally, an effective dose of each will be used. Thus, for example, when a compound of the Formula I is combined with an NSAID, the weight ratio of the compound of the Formula I to the NSAID will generally range from about 1000 1 to about 1 1000, preferably about 200 1 to about 1 200. Combinations of a compound of theFormula I and other active ingredients will generally also be within the aforementioned range, but in each case, an effective dose of each active ingredient should be used. Combinations of a compound of the Formula I and other active ingredients will generally be in the aforementioned ratios.

Representative compounds of Formula I have been tested using the following assay to determine their mammalian leukotriene biosynthesis inhibiting activity. Mouse Macrophage Assay Mouse peritoneal macrophages were treated sequentially with arachidonic acid labelled with tritium the compound being evaluated as an inhibitor, and stimulator zymosan . Metabolites derived from arachidonic acid PGE2, 6 keto PG Fla and Leukotriene C4 were separated from the incubation medium by extraction and chromatography, and then quantitated by determining the amount of radioactivity cpm associated with each of them. Inhibitors caused a reduction in the amount of radioactivity cpm associated with a givenmetabolite. This protocol is identical to that described in the reference except that the radioactivity herein associated with the LTC4 was determined by counting an aliquot of the final aqueous solution directly rather than chromatographing it first .

The following assays were employed in ascertaining these properties. Asthmatic Rat Assay Rats were obtained from an inbred line of asthmatic rats. Both female and male rats from 200 to 300 g were used. Egg albumin EA , grade V, crystallized and lyophilized, was obtained from Sigma Chemical Co.,St. Louis. Bordetella pertussis vaccine, containing 30 x 109 killed bacteria per ml was obtained from the Institut Armand Frappier, Laval des Rapides,Quebec. Aluminum hydroxide was obtained from theRegis Chemical Company, Chicago. The challenge and subsequent respiratory recordings were carried out in a clear plastic box with internal dimensions 10 x 6 x 4 inches. The top of the box was removable in use, it was held firmly in place by four clamps and an airtight seal was maintained by a soft rubber gasket. Through the center of each end of the chamber a Devilbiss nebulizer No. 40 was inserted via an airtight seal and each end of the box also had an outlet. AFleisch No. 0000 pneumotachograph was inserted into one end of the box and coupled to a Grass volumetric pressure transducer PT5 A which was then connected to a Beckman Type R Dynograph through appropriate couplers. While aerosolizing the antigen, the outlets were open and the pneumotachograph was isolated from the chamber. The outlets were closed and the pneumotachograph and the chamber were connected during the recording of the respiratory patterns.For challenge, 2 ml of a 3 solution of antigen in saline was placed into each nebulizer and the aerosol was generated with air from a smallPotter diaphragm pump operating at 10 psi and a flow of 8 liters minute. Rats were sensitized by injecting s.c. 1 ml of a suspension containing 1 mg EA and 200 mg aluminum hydroxide in saline. Simultaneously, they received an injection i.p. of 0.5 ml of B.pertussis vaccine. They were used between days 14 and 18 postsensitization. In order to eliminate the serotonin component of the response, rats were pretreated intravenously 5 minutes prior to aerosol challenge with 30 gm kg 1 methysergide. Rats were then exposed to an aerosol of 3 EA in saline for exactly 1 minute, then their respiratory profiles were recorded for a further 25 30 minutes. The duration of continuous dyspnea was measured from the respiratory recordings. Compounds were generally administered either intraperitoneally 1 hour prior to challenge or orally 1 1 2 hours prior to challenge. They were either dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide or suspended in 0.1 methocel and 0.5 Tween 80. The volume injected has 2 ml kg l intraperitoneally or 10 ml keg 1 orally . Prior to oral treatment rats were starved overnight. Their activity was determined in terms of their ability to decrease the duration of symptoms of dyspnea in comparison with a group of vehicletreated controls. Usually, a compound was evaluated at a series of doses and an ED50 was determined. This was defined as the dose in mg kg which would inhibit the duration of symptoms by 50 . PAF Induced Hyperalgesia Assay Female Sprague Dawley rats, 35 40 g were fasted overnight. Platelet activating factor, PAF, L lecithin B acetyl O alkyl 1 veg 0.1 ml was given by subplantar injection in the rat paw. The compounds to be evaluated were homogenized in AqueousVehicle 0.9 benzyl alcohol, 0.5 Tween 80 and 0.4 methylcellulose and administered orally in a volume of 0.1 ml, 30 minutes prior to PAF. Animals were tested 1, 2, 3 and 4 hours after PAF administration. The vocalization threshold, defined as the pressure mmHg needed to evoke a squeak response, was recorded for both the injected and contralateral paw. No animal was subjected to pressure greater than 60 mmHg.Hyperalgesia is defined as a decrease in vocalization threshold as compared to a normal paw. Percent inhibition of hyperalgesia was calculated as the proportion of animals with vocalization thresholds greater than 200 of controls.
