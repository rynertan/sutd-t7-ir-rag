# Pressurized non refillable recreation ball filled with sulfur hexafluoride.

## Abstract
A pressurized, non refillable recreation ball inflated with a mixture of sulfur hexafluoride and air for improved shelf life and pressure retention is obtained by filling the ball with sulfur hexafluoride in a range of 65 to 75 by volume and 35 to 25 by volume of air. Preferably, the sulfur hexafluoride is present in an amount of 71 by volume. The recreation balls include tennis balls, racquet balls, squash balls, handballs and other non refillable pressurized balls.
