# Antenna tracking device.

## Abstract
The antenna tracking device comprises an antenna 30 which is so controlled in direction as to receive a plurality of beacon signals at different frequencies transmitted from a plurality of stationary satellites, respectively, which are spaced apart from each other by a relatively small distance. An error detector 1 is connected to the feed 31 of the an tenna 30 for detecting error signals each representing the difference between the incoming direction of each beacon signal and the axial direction of the main beam of the anten na. A reference signal generator is responsive to each beacon signal delivered to a receiver for generating a refer ence signal. A tracking receiver 2 to 5 receives the refer ence signals and the error signals to generate the tracking error signals each consisting of mutually orthogonal com ponents. The antenna tracking device further includes syn thesizer means 6, 7 for combining the components in the same directions of the tracking error signals from the track ing receiver, thereby generating the antenna driving sig nals. In response to these driving signals, the antenna is di rected to the midpoint or center of a plurality of stationary satellites.
