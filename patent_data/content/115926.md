## Description
AQUEOUS METALWORKING LUBRICANT CONTAINING POLYOXYPROPYLENE POLYOXYETHYLENE POLYOXYPROFYLENE BLOCK COPOLYMERS The present invention relates to lubricant compositions and more particularly to water soluble lubricant compositions suitable for use in metalworking operations such as the cold rolling and hot rolling of aluminum and aluminum alloys, and the invention relates to such metalworking operations. In the rolling of metals such as aluminum and aluminum alloys, it is customary to flood the rolls and the workpiece with a coolant for the purpose of carrying away heat generated by the operation. It is also customary to employ the coolant in combination with various agents having load bearing and friction modifying properties for reducing friction between the rolls and the workpiece. It has heretofore been the practice to use for such purpose aqueous compositions containing such lubricating agents as emulsified petroleum and nonpetroleum additives. In order to perform satisfactorily on an industrial scale, an aqueous lubricant fluid must meet several important requirements. Among the requirements for a satisfactory metalworking lubricant are corrosion inhibiting properties and stability under conditions of operation.While various fluids may posses such characteristics, there are also other important requirements that should be met. Among these requirements is the avoidance of deposits on the rolls and workpiece following the rolling operation. Such deposits result from drying of the fluid, and they are difficult to remove. Other important re quirements include avoidance of excessive foam formation.Metalworking lubricants in the form of aqueous solutions have generally not been able to satisfy all of the foregoing requirements prior to the present invention. Aqueous metalworking lubricant compositions are known in the prior art. However, prior to the present invention, aqueous metalworking lubricants were not placed into widespread commercial use because of their inability to satisfy simultaneously each of the requirements listed above. Beaubien et al. U.S. Patent No. 2,825,693 claims a metalworking lubricant concentrate comprising about 5 20 each of a block polyoxypropylene polyoxyethylene copolymer and a random polyoxypropylenepolyoxyethylene copolymer, about 1 12 each of sodium nitrite and ethanolamine, and about 0.01 5 of an unsaturated high molecular weight fatty acid. The block polyoxypropylene polyoxyethylene copolymers disclosed byBeaubien et al. are conjugated in the order EO PO EO nEO denotes polyoxyethylene and PO denotes polyoxypropylene , rather than being the PO EO PO block copolymers of the present invention. Reamer U.S. Patent No. 2,981,686 discloses an aqueous metalworking lubricant comprising a water soluble hetero copolymer of a mixture of oxyethylene and oxypropylene groups. The Reamer patent states that block copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide are undesirable in such lubricants because of the tendency of these copolymers to produce undesirable frictional problems, foaming, instability and the like . Davis U.S. Patent No. 3,374,171 claims a cutting fluid containing about 5 40 of a water soluble alkanolamine, about 0.1 9 of a saturated organic acid having about 6 9 carbon atoms per molecule, and about 0.5 20 of a water soluble polyoxyalkylene glycol. TheDavis patent contains no specific teaching of the utility of PO EO PO block copolymers as ingredients of aqueous metalworking compositions. In addition, Davis cautions against the use of higher molecular weight saturated organic acids. He states that such higher organic acids can result in poor hard water stability, reduced corrosion inhibiting properties and high foaming tendencies. These problems are said to lead to clogged filters, poor rust protection and reduced tool life in areas where hard water is encountered. Felton U.S. Patent No. 4,033,886 discloses a liquid suitable for the formation of a recyclable metalworking lubricant. The liquid is an aqueous solution containing a mixture of ethylene oxide propylene oxide block copolymers, an alkanolamine cinnamate and a boron amine complex. The block copolymers have a central portion of polypropylene oxide with polyethylene oxide on each end see column 2, lines 32 33 . It is a principal object of the present invention to provide an aqueous metalworking lubricant composition having acceptable load bearing and friction modifying properties, corrosion inhibition ability and chemical stability under ordinary operating conditions, and avoidance of deposits on tools and workpieces following metalworking operations in which the composition is used. It is a related object of the invention to provide a lubricant composition accomplishing the foregoing objectives while at the same time avoiding excessive production of foam. According to the present invention there is provided a lubricant composition which includes a block polyoxypropylene polyoxyethylene copolymer, characterized by comprising a about 1.0 20 wt of a water soluble mixture of polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene block copolymers containing a single polyoxyethylene chain and two polyoxypropylene chains attached to the polyoxyethylene chain, the average molecular weight of the polyoxypropylene chains in the mixture being at least 900 and the poly oxyethylene chains in the mixture constituting about 10 80 wt , preferably about 20 wt , of the mixture b about 0.5 10 wt , preferably 0.5 5 or 1 2 wt , of a water soluble carboxylic acid of the general formula CmH2m n r 2 COOH r where m is an integer from 11 to 36, n 0, 2, 4 or 6 and r 1 or 2 c about 0.5 10 wt of a water soluble 4 alkanolamine and d remainder, water. Further in accordance with the present invention there is provided a method of metalworking such as cold or hot rolling of aluminum or aluminum alloys, characterized by applying to a metal object a synthetic lubricant composition in accordance with the lubricant composition of this invention, and, optionally, hot rolling or cold rolling the metal object. In accordance with the present invention, there is provided an aqueous synthetic metalworking lubricant having good lubricating properties in metal fabricating operations. The lubricant is especially suitable for use in the hot rolling and cold rolling of aluminum and aluminum alloys into sheet and foil form. The lubricant comprises a water soluble mixture of PO EO PO block copolymers, a water soluble carboxylic acid, a water soluble alkanolamine and water.A preferred lubricant composition also contains an antifoam agent. The PO EO PO block copolymers comprise about 1.0 20 wt of the composition. The average molecular weight of polyoxypropylene chains in the mixture is at least 900, and the polyoxyethylene chains constitute about 10 80 wt of the mixture. The carboxylic acid comprises about 0.5 10 wt of the composition and may be a saturated or unsaturatedC11 to C36 mono or dicarboxylic acid. The acid is pre ferably a saturated or monounsaturated C12 to C20 monocarboxylic acid. Two preferred carboxylic acids are oleic acid and lauric acid. The water soluble alkanolamine comprises about 0.5 10 wt of the composition. Some particularly preferred alkanolamines are triethanolamine, diethanolamine and ethyldiisopropanolamine. The aqueous synthetic metalworking lubricant composition of the invention is suitable for use with both ferrous and non ferrous metals. The lubricant composition can be used in such operations as rolling, drawing and ironing, machining and others. The lubricant composition exhibits satisfactory load bearing and friction modifying properties when used for either hot rolling or cold rolling of aluminum alloys. The term hot rolling refers to rolling that takes place at a metal entry temperature of approximately 232 5380C. 450 10000F for aluminum alloys. Hot rolls ing is typically used t o reduce slabs of aluminum alloy material that are about 8 cm several inches thick into sheets having a thickness of about 3 mm 1 8 inch . The term cold rolling refers to rolling in which metal entry temperature may range from approximate liy ambient temperature to about 2320C. 4500F. for aluminum alloys. Metal entry temperature is ordinarily about ambient temperature. Cold rolling is typically used to reduce sheets of aluminum alloy material about 3 mm 1 8 inch thick into lesser thicknesses. One ingredient of the lubricant composition is a water soluble mixture of EO PO block copolymers containing a single EO chain and two PO chains attached to the EO chain. These block copolymers have the general formulaEMI5.1 The average molecular weight of PO chains in the mixture is at least 900, and the EO chains in the mixture con stitute about 10 80 wt of the mixture. The average molecular weight of PO chains in the mixture is preferably about 1000 to 3100. In one preferred mixture, the average molecular weight of PO chains in the mixture is about 1700, and FO chains constitute about 20 wt of the mixture. Such materials are sold under the trade name Pluronic R by BASF Wyandotte Corporation of Wyandotte,Michigan. The mixture of block copolymers constitutes about 1.0 20 wt of the lubricant composition, generally about 2.5 10 wt . One typical example contains about 5 wt of a mixture of block PO EO PO copolymers wherein the average molecular weight of PO chains in the mixture is about 1700, and the EO chains constitute about 20 wt of the mixture. This mixture is sold under the trade designation 17R2 . The mixture of block copolymers functions as an additive solubilizer, viscosity builder and antiwear agent in the lubricant composition. The PO EO PO block copolymers are formed by the sequential addition of ethylene oxide and then propylene oxide to an ethylene glycol base. These conjugated or block copolymers are described in greater detail in Jackson et al. U.S. Patent No. 3,036,118 issued May 22, 1962. A second ingredient of the composition is a water soluble carboxylic acid having the general formula CmH2m n r 2 COOH r where m is an integer from 11 to 36, n 0, 2, 4 or 6 and r 1 or 2. The carboxylic acid is preferably a saturated or monounsaturated C12 to C20 monocarboxylic acid. Two particularly preferred monocarboxylic acids are oleic acid and lauric acid. An alternative formulation of the lubricant composition includes a dimeric unsaturated fatty acid, such as dilinoleic acid. Dimeric fatty acids are also commercially available as dimer acids , usually con taming a total of about 32 to 36 carbon atoms. These acids result from the dimerization of polyunsaturated fatty acids containing from 16 to 18 carbon atoms. For example, the term C16 C18 dimer acids refers to a commercially available dimerization product of mixed C16 C18 polyunsaturated fatty acids. The water soluble carboxylic acid comprises about 0.5 10 wt of the composition, preferably about 0.5 5 wt . Compositions containing about 1 2 wt of the acid are quite suitable. Two suitable lubricant compositions include 1 wt oleic acid and 2 wt oleic acid, respectively. The carboxylic acid functions as a load bearing and friction modifying additive in the composition. A third ingredient of the composition is a water soluble alkanolamine. Some suitable alkanolamines are monoethanolamine, diethanolamine, triethanolamine, dimethyl ethanolamine, diethyl ethanolamine, aminoethyl ethanolamine, methyl diethanolamine, N acetyl ethanolamine, phenylethanolamine, phenyldethanolamine, mono , di andtriisopropanolamine, and mixtures of any of the foregoing alkanolamines. the preferred alkanolamines are triethanolamine, diethanolamine and ethyl disopropanolamne. The water soluble alkanolamine comprises about 0.5 10 wt of the lubricant composition, preferably about 0.5 3 wt . Two preferred compositions include 0.8 wt triethanolamine and 1.6 wt triethanolamine, respectively. The alkanolamine has the function of partially or completely converting the carboxylic acid into amine soap. The alkanolamine should preferably be present in sufficient concentration that at least one amine group is present for each carboxyl group in the carboxylic acid. In the preferred form, the lubricant composition of the invention also contains a defoaming agent.One preferred composition contains about 50 100 ppm about .005 .01 wt of a non silicone defoaming agent.This agent comprises organic and silica derivatives dispersed in a solvent and is sold commercially by MazerChemicals Inc. of Gurnee, Illinois as its MAZU DF 2502 defoamer. A less preferred lubricant composition comprises about 25 ppm about .0025 wt of a silicone defoaming agent. The defoaming agent is chosen so as to produce suitable reductions in foam while at the same time avoiding deposits on metal, surfaces that affect coating or paint adhesion. The lubricant composition may also include about 0.5 10 wt of a water soluble polyoxyethylene or polyoxypropylene alcohol or a water soluble carboxylic acid ester of such alcohol. Two suitable esters are a monostearate of a polyethylene glycol having a molecular weight of about 400, and a dioleate of a polyethylene glycol having a molecular weight of about 1000. These esters are typically added to form about 1 wt of the lubricant composition. The esters add to lubricity of the composition. Additional additives known to persons skilled in the art may be desirable under certain conditions.Such additives may include biocides, oxidation inhibitors and corrosion inhibitors.
