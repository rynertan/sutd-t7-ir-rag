# Polyisophthalates and copolymers thereof having high barrier properties.

## Abstract
Polyisophthalates, for example, poly ethyleneisophtha late , or copolymers thereof, have low glass transition temperatures, even lower than poly ethylene terephthalate . Unexpectedly, such polyisophthalates have very good bar rier properties with regard to oxygen and carbon dioxide penetration. The polyisophthalates can be utilized as packag ing materials, for example as films or containers such as bottles for beverages such as intoxicating beverages such as beer, and the like.
