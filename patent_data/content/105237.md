# PROCESS FOR THE BENEFICIATION OF CARBONACEOUS MATTER EMPLOYING HIGH SHEAR CONDITIONING

## Abstract
A process for the production of beneficiated coal and coal slurries having low ash, and sulfur involving admixing coal in an aqueous medium, under high shear agitation, with a polymeri zable monomer, and a liquid organic carrier thereby rendering said coal highly hydrophobic and oleophilic.
