## Description
This invention relates to a working apparatus of pliable structure, such as a cargo handling apparatus with a multiple degree of freedom, a robbot, etc., which is equipped with an arm assembly having a plurality of arms connected together for pivotal movement. To save labor and cope with diversification of workload in assembling and construction workstations, there has in recent years been an increasing demand for a working apparatus equipped with an arm assembly having a plurality of arms with a multiple degree of freedom. Meanwhile, one of the problems which manufactures encounter nowadays in reducing production costs is how to obtain a light weight of this type of working apparatus. Under these circumstances, assembling robots and coating robots have in recent years been introduced. These robots have relatively short arms which are about 2 to 3 meters in length, and no great influences are exerted on production costs even if a rigid structure with little deflection is adopted to increase the precision and accuracy with which the arms are positioned. However, in working apparatus such as construction machines, an arm assembly having a plurality of arms of large length which are 20 to 30 meters in length and have a plurality of joints is required to handle articles of heavy weight. In this type of working apparatus, it is impossible to adopt a rigid structure as is the case with the assembling and coating robots referred to hereinabove, because the size of the arms would have to be increased and an increase in the size of the arms would require an increase in the size of actuators for driving the arms. This would inevitably result in a rise in production costs. After all, the use of a rigid structure in this type of working apparatus would be economically infeasible. This has prompted one to try to adopt a pliable structure for working apparatus in which the arms have minimized dimensions including the width . The problem encountered in working apparatus of pliable structure is that difficulty is experienced in achieving a high degree of precision and accuracy in positioning the arms because of possible inevitable deflection of the arms. GB A 2 102 590 shows a digital movement controller for automatic multi axis machines. Each axis is moved by an actuator and its movement is monitored by a transducer electrically connected to an individual control module including digital data processing means that repeatedly determines the distance through which the axis has moved, compares the position of the axis with an interim target position and supplies a control signal to the actuator to cause it to move to a required direction and velocity during the next time period until the axis has reached its final target position. EP A 062 076 dicloses a control method and an apparatus for controlling an industrial robot. The apparatus includes a memory for storing the deflection amount of an arm when the arm having a predetermined length holds a workpiece having a predetermined weight. An arithmetic circuit is provided for calculating the deflection amount of bending caused by a workpiece of any weight on the basis of the prestored values. This invention has been developed for the purpose of obviating the aforesaid problem in adopting a pliable structure for a working apparatus. Accordingly, the invention has as its object the provision of a working apparatus of pliable structure which is capable, by accommodating a deflection of each arm, of achieving positioning the arms with a high degree of precision and accuracy during operation of the working apparatus. To accomplish the aforesaid object, there is provided according to the invention a working apparatus having the features as recited in claim 1. In the working apparatus of pliable structure, it may further comprise correction initiation indication means for starting correction of the positioning error caused by the deflection of the arm assembly, whereby the first arm member and second arm member are first pivotally moved by the signal produced by the pivoting angle calculation means and then they are pivotally moved by the signal produced by the correcting angle calculation means to correct the positioning error after the pivotal movement of the first and second arm members caused by the first signal has been terminated. The angle gauges E₁ and E₂, accelerometers A₁ and A₂ and force sensor F are arranged in a manner to constitute parts of a positioning control system 20 shown in Fig. 2. The control system 20 comprises a target position indication device 22 operative to produce a signal for indicating a target position of the external load applied point O₃ at the forward end of the second arm member 10 in the form of signals indicative of the coordinate values x, y of an x y coordinate system having its origin at the point O₁. The signal x, y produced by the indication device 22 is delivered into a control unit 24 for correcting an error caused by the deflection of the arm assembly 6 in positioning the forward end of the second arm member 10. The control unit 24 comprises a deflection calculation section 24a connected to the angle gauges E₁ and E₂, accelerometers A₁ and A₂ and force sensor F for inputting signals ϑ₁, ϑ₂, α₁, α₂, and P therefrom to calculate a deflection at the external load applied point O₃ as values Δx and Δy of the x and y direction components of the x y coordinate system, an initial position calculation section 24b connected to the angle gauges E₁ and E₂ and target position indication device 22 for inputting signals produced by the angle gauges E₁ and E₂ when the device 22 produces the signal x, y for indicating the target position and calculating an initial position of the external load applied point O₃ as coordinate values x The signals x The adders 24f and 24g produce outputs which are supplied to adders for feedback 24h and 24i, respectively, which calculate differences between the corrected pivoting angles ϑ The outputs produced by the adders 24h and 24i are also supplied to a comparator section 24j where it is judged whether or not the differences The principle of calculations done at the deflection calculation section 24a of the control unit 24 will be described by referring to Figs. 3 and 4. Referring to Fig. 3, let the torque acting on the point O₁ and the torque acting on the point O₂ when the first arm member 8 and second arm member 10 are pivotally moved be denoted by T₁ and T₂, respectively. Then, the torques T₁ and T₂ can be expressed as follows utilizing Lagrangian equation of motion where In the above values, J₁, J₂, J₃, m₁, m₂, ℓ₁, ℓ₂, ℓ The relations and exist between the accelerations α₁ and α₂ and the angular velocities Thus, the sum W₁, W₂ of the dynamic loads acting on the points O₂ and O₃ at the forward ends of the first arm member 8 and second arm member 10 and the loads applied thereto by the weights of arm members can be obtained if one divides by the lengths ℓ₁ and ℓ₂ of the first arm member 8 and second arm member 10 the torques T₁ and T₂ obtained by the equations 1 and 2 , respectively, as follows Thus, the deflection V₂ produced at the point O₃ at the forward end of the second arm member 10 by the sum W₂ of the dynamic load and the static load applied to the point O₃ can be obtained by the following equation The deflection V₁ produced at the point O₂ at the forward end of the first arm member 8 by the sum W₁ of the dynamic load the static load applied to the point O₂ can be obtained by the following equation Thus, the x and y coordinates of the deflections V₁ and V₂ in the x y coordinate system which may be denoted by V In this way, the deflections Δx and Δy are calculated at the deflection calculation section 24a. In the locus position calculation section 24c of the control unit 24, the coordinate values x Calculation is done as follows in the pivoting angle calculation section 24d. Let us assume that the external load applied point O₃ is located in the instantaneous target position x Since Likewise, the following relation holds based on the cosine theorem with regard to the triangle O₁O₂O₃ In the correcting angle calculation section 24e, calculation is done as follows In the embodiment shown and described hereinabove, the calculation sections 24a 24e and the comparator section 24j of the control unit 24 can be constituted by logical circuits. Also, they can be realized by using a microcomputer. The control unit as a whole can be realized by using a microcomputer. An operation program for the control unit 24 to be used when it is realized by using a microcomputer will be described by referring to the flow charts shown in Figs. 5 and 6. In step In step In the embodiment shown and described hereinabove, the signals α₁ and α₂ produced by the accelerometers A₁ and A₂ have been used to obtain angular accelerations In the embodiments shown in Fig. 2, the arm assembly 6 has been described as comprising the first arm member 8 and second arm member 10. However, the invention is not limited to this specific number of arm members, and the arm assembly may comprise three or more than three arm members, for example. The arm members 8 and 10 have been described as being driven for pivotal movement by the hydraulic cylinders 12 and 14, respectively. However, this is not restrictive, and any actuators such as hydraulic motors may be used as actuators in place of the hydraulic cylinders 12 and 14. The arm members 8 and 10 may be driven, not hydraulically, but pneumatically or electrically as desired. In the embodiments shown in Fig. 2, the arm assembly 6 is constructed such that an external load is applied only to the forward end of the second arm member 10. However, the invention is not limited to this specific construction of the arm assembly, and the first arm member 8 may support in a predetermined position a deck for an operator to stand and supervise the operation, so that an additional external load is applied to the arm assembly 6 in a portion thereof other than the forward end of the second arm member 10. From the foregoing description, it will be appreciated that the working apparatus of pliable structure according to the invention is constructed such that the arm assembly can be positioned with a high degree of accuracy and precision by taking into consideration the deflections of the arm members, and this makes the working apparatus of pliable structure according to the invention suitable for use as working apparatus, such as construction machinery, which require elongated arms of light weight.
