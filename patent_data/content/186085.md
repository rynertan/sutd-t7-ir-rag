DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In general, the compound of this invention may be prepared by reacting a 2,3 diamino 2,3 dideoxy sugar with potassium tetrachloroplatinate in aqueous medium, giving the platinum chloride sugar complex, which is then reacted with the appropriate di or tricarboxylic acid in aqueous medium. The novel complexed compounds of this invention possess the property of inhibiting the growth of transplanted tumors in mammals as established by the following tests.Lymphocytic Leukemia P388 Test The animals used were BDF 1 mice, all of one sex, weighing a minimum of 18 g and all within a 3 g weight range. There were 5 or 6 animals per test group.The tumor transplant was by intraperitoneal injection of 0.5 ml of dilute ascitic fluid containing 106 cells of lymphocytic leukemia P388. The test compounds were administered intraperitoneally on days 1, 5 and 9 relative to tumor inoculation, at various doses. The animals were weighed and the survivors recorded on a regular basis for 30 days. The median survival time and the ratio of survival time for treated T icontrol C animals were calculated. The positive control compound was either Cisplatin or 1,4 dihydroxy 5,8 bist 2 2 hydroxyethylamino ethyl amin9 anthraquinone, dihydrochloride U. S. Patent 4,197,249 .

J., et al.,Quantitative Comparison of Toxicity of Anticancer Agent in Mouse, Rat, Hamster, Dog, Monkey and Man. CancerChemother. Rep., 50, No. 4, 219 244, May 1966. A prefe red dosage regimen for optimum results would be from about 3 mg m2 day to about 200 mg m2 day, and such dosage uni s are employed that a total of from about 5 mg to about 360 mg of the active compound for subject of about 7a kg of body weight are administered in a 24 hour period. T.iis dosage regimen may be adjusted to provide the optimum therapeutic response.For example, several divided doses may be administered daily or the dose may be proportronally reduced as indicated by the exigencies of the therapeutic situation. The active compound may be administered , the intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous routes. The active compounds may be administered pa ten terally. Solutions or dispersions of the active compound can be prepared in water, suitably mixed with a surfactant such as hydroxypropylcellulose. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols, aid mixtures thereof in oils. Under ordinary conditions of storage and use these preparations contain a preser ative to prevent the growth of microorganisms. The pharmaceutical forms suitable for injsctable use include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersiors and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. In a.l cases the form must be sterile and must be fluid to the extent that easy syringability exists. It must be stabl under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol e.g. glycerol, propylene glycol, liquid polyethylene glycol , suitable mixtures thereof and vegetable oils.The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. The prevention of the action of microorganisms can be brought about by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, thimerosal and the like. In many cases it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars or sodium chloride. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be obtained by the use in the compositions of agents which delay absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin.Sterile injectable solutions are prepared by incorporating the active compound inthe required amount in the appropriate solvent with various of the other ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the various sterilized active ingredient into a sterile vehicle which contains the basic dispersion medium and the required other.ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and the freeze drying technique which yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile filtered solution thereof. As used herein pharmaceutically acceptable carrier includes any and all solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents and the like. The use of such media and agents for pharmaceutically active sub stances is well known in the art. Except insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatable with the active ingredient, its use in the therapeutic compositions is contemplated. Supplementary active ingredients can also be incorporated into the compositions. It is especially advantageous to formulate paren teral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of admin istration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the mammalian subject to be treated each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier.The specification for the novel dosage unit forms of the invention are dictated by and directly depen dent on a the unique characteristics of the active material and the particular therapeutic effect to.be achieved, and b the limitations inherent in the art of compounding such an active material for the treatment of disease in living subjects having a diseased condition in which bodily health is impaired as herein disclosed in detail. The prinicpal active ingredient is compounded for convenient and effective administration in effective amounts with a suitable pharmaceutically acceptable car rier in dosage unit form as hereinbefore disclosed. A unit dosage form can, for example, contain the principal active compound in amounts ranging from about 2 mg to about 2 g, with from about 5 to about 360 mg being pre ferred. Expressed in proportions, the active compound i , generally present in from about 2 to about 100 mg ml of carrier. In the case of compositions containing supple mentary active ingredients, the dosages are determined by reference to the usual dose and manner of administration of the said ingredients. Regression and palliation of cancers are attained, for example, using intraperitoneal administration. A single intravenous dosage or repeated daily dosages can be administered. Daily dosages up to about 5 or 10 days are often sufficient. It is also possible to dispense one daily dosage or one dose on alternate or less frequent days. As can be seen from the dosage regimens, the amount of principal active ingredient administered is a sufficient amount to aid regression and palliation of the leukemia or the like, in the absence of excessive deleterious side effects of a cytotoxic nature to the host harboring the cancer. As used herein, cancer disease means blood malignancies such as leukemia, as well as other solid and non solid malignancies such as the melanocarcinomas, lung carcinomas and mammary tumors.By regression and palliation is meant arresting or retarding the growth of the tumor or other manifestation of the disease compared to the course of the disease in the absence of treatment.
