# Apparatus for multiplexing and demultiplexing data sources.

## Abstract
A plurality of terrestrial interface modules TIMs 15a, 15b....15n are multiplexed and demultiplexed with common equipment through the use of mapping RAMs contained in each TIM. The common equipment provides identical ad dresses to each of the mapping RAMs in the TIMs. The mapping RAMs in each TIM determine whether incoming or outgoing data is to be written into or read from the asso ciated TIM, and generate an address for the data so written into or read from the TIM. A mapping RAM is further provided in the common equipment to allow for burst to burst selection of data. A stream of data in standard PCM format is written into sequential locations of buffer memo ries, and subsequently read out of the memories in a dif ferent order so as to effect a reorganization of the PCM data. The reorganization of data pachs all the bits associated with a single channel into a single contiguous block of time for an entire frame of data.
