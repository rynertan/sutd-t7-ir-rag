## Description
Novel vectors for interferon expression Recent advances in molecular biology have made it possible to introduce DNA sequences coding for specific proteins from higher organisms into yeast cells. Recombinant DNA technology has, in fact, been used to express eucaryotic proteins a whose genes have been cloned in vectors, such as plasmids, in yeast cells, typically Saccharomyces cerevisiae which have been transformed with those vectors. See Hitzeman, R. A., et al., 1981 Nature 293, 717 722 Valenzuela, P., et al., 1982 Nature 298, 347 350 Tuite1 M. F., et al., 1982 EMBO Journal 1, 603 608. The expression of heterologous genes in S. cerevisiae achieved by Hitzeman et al. and Valenzuela et al. was constitutive or continuous because the genes were linked to the promoter region from the unregulated alcohol dehydrogenase ADH I gene. Tuite et al. and Hitzeman et al., 1983 Science 219, 620 625, used the promoter from the phosphoglycerate kinase gene for expression of human interferon genes. The prior art already recognized that regulated synthesis of a foreign gene would be desirable because over production of even normally non toxic gene products may be harmful to host cells and lead to decreased stability of particular host vector systems. A good expression control sequence, therefore, in addition to improving the efficiency of transcription and translation of cloned genes, should be controllable so as to modulate expression during host cell growth. Desired expression control sequences are those that may be switched off to enable the host cells to propagate without build up of the desired foreign gene products and then to be switched on to promote the expression of large amounts of the desired protein products. Tuite et al., using the PGK gene promoter, control the level of interferon expression by the carbon source.While the inducedÂµ level of interferon expression was high, the uninduced level was only moderately high, resulting in an induction of less than 20 fold. Miyanohara, A. et al., 1983 Proc. Nati. Acad. Sci. USA 80, 1 5, have reported the regulated expression of heptatitis B virus surface antigen in yeast with the yeast acid phosphatase gene PH05 promoter. The prior art, however, lacked a tightly regulated control element for the expression of interferon genes in yeast cells in which the uninducedW level of foreign interferon protein expression was low and the induced level was high. It is, therefore, an object of this invention to provide a regulatory control element of this type which would allow for the growth of yeast cells to a high population density without concurrently risking a harmful buildup of the interferon protein until it is actually desired to have the yeast cell induce and express the interferon protein. The present invention provides an improved expression vector capable of regulating the expression of heterologous genes in a transformed yeast strain. More specifically, this improved expression vector which incorporates the promoter regulator DNA region from the yeast repressible acid phosphatase gene, regulates the expression of the gene for human leukocyte interferon. This invention also provides for yeast cells transformed with the improved expression vector. These transformed yeast cells produce significant amounts of interferon only when grown in medium lacking inorganic phosphate Pi . This invention further provides for transformed yeast cells which are also mutants in two acid phosphatase regulatory genes coding for a defective repressor and a temperature sensitive positive regulator which grow well at a high temperature 30 350C but produce foreign proteins, i.e. interferon, only at a low temperature 20 300C , independent of phosphate concentration. Brief Description of the Drawings Figure 1 is a map of the PH05 promoter 5 flanking region. The RNA 5 end position and the translation initiation codon as well as relevant restriction sites for thePH05 gene are shown. The Taq I site at position 11 from the ATG between the RNA 5 end and the ATG was converted to an EcoRI site for the expression vector. The major RNA 5 ends for PH05 transcripts map at positions 41 and 35. Figure 2A illustrates the pYE4 expression vector. TheClaI to EcoRI fragment with the PH05 transcription start site was inserted into the yeast E. coli shuttle vectorYRp7 11 that had the EcoRI site in parentheses deleted.In addition the 1.1 Kb ClaI fragment from the PH05 promoter fig. 1 and sequences from the yeast 2 micron plasmid were added. The gene to be expressed under PH05 type regulation is inserted at the remaining EcoRI site.EMI3.1 pBR322DNA,EMI3.2 yeast DNA,EMI3.3 2 micron plasmid DNA . Figure 2B illustrates the nucleotide sequences preceding the translation initiation codon ATG in the originalPH05 gene and in the PHO5 rIFN aD fusion. Figure 3 schematically illustrates the construction of pYE4. Figure 4 schematically illustrates the construction of a plasmid used to construct pYE4. Figure 5 illustrates the plasmid pYE4 with the relevant restriction sites indicated. figure 6 illustrates the plasmid pYE7 with the relevant restriction sites indicated. Figure 7 graphically illustrates the regulated expression of rIFN oD in yeast. Transformants carrying pYE4 D were grown in high P. medium solid symbols or no Pi medium open symbols . The cell growthEMI4.1 APase acid phosphatase activityEMI4.2 and interferon activity in extractsEMI4.3 were monitored. T 0 is the time at which the starter culture was divided into high Pi or no P.medium. Figure 8 illustrates interferon RNA levels. RNA samples were prepared from the cells described in Figure 3 high Pi, no Pi at the indicated times and analyzed by gel blot analysis 17 . Figure 9 graphically illustrates the temperature regulation of interferon synthesis. The pho80 pho4 strain 29B5 transformed with pYE4 D was grown at 35 C to anOD600nm of la at which time t 0 half the culture was shifted to 230C open symbols and the other half was kept at 35 C solid symbols . Cell growthEMI4.4 A A Phase acti vityEMI4.5 and interferon activityEMI4.6 were monitored. The vector system of the present invention, which tightly regulates expression of foreign genes in yeast, utilizes the 5 flanking region from the yeast repressible acid phosphatase APase gene, otherwise known as the PH05 gene. Transcription of the PHOS gene in a yeast cell is repressed when inorganic phosphate P. is present in the growth medium but is induced to a high level when Pi is depleted. A unique restriction enzyme site was introduced downstream from the transcription start site but upstream from the ATG initiator codon on a DNA fragment carrying the putative promoter regulatory DNA region from the PH05 gene.A structural gene inserted into this site will have translation started at its own initiator codon, resulting in an authentic or mature rather than a fusion protein. The structural gene used with this invention is preferably a eucaryotic gene which encodes for a protein foreign to that of the host yeast cell. The particular eucaryotic genes used in this invention are those which encode for mature human leukocyte interferons, especially A and D species IFN aA and IFN aD . The gene sequences which encode for these proteins and their corresponding amino acid sequences are known and have been described in various printed publications. See Pestka, The Human Interferons From Protein Purification and Sequence to Cloning andExpression in Bacteria Before, Between and Beyond ,Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics, 221, No. 1, 1 37 1983 .Although human eucaryotic genes were used in this invention, it is contemplated that gene from any eucaryotic species e.g. bovine, murine and porcine could also be used with the PHOS gene promoter regulator system. However, as described in the examples and specification which follows the PH05 gene promoter expression system of this invention was tested by inserting the cloned genes for human leukocyte interferon rIFN aD and rIFN oA into an expression vector. Another efficient and preferred method for induction, especially for large scale growth, utilizes a strain ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae APase regulatory mutants 8 to develop a yeast strain that induces APase and, therefore, genes in the PH05 promoter expression vector which vector includes regulatory and structural genes only in response to temperature, At the non permissive temperature about 30 35 C the cells grow well but produce no APase, even in low Pi medium, while at the permissive temperature about 20 30 C, preferably 230C APase is synthesized with or without P. in the medium. This strain carrying the PH05 promoter expression vector has also be used to demonstrate temperature regulated expression of foreign genes specifically the rIFN aD gene in yeast.The production of leukocyte interferon is induced at the lower temperatures, preferably 230C. The materials utilized in the various embodiments of this invention are described below. The reference numbers in parentheses included throughout the specification correspond to the references cited in the attached bibliography. Yeast Strains and Media W301 18A aade2 l leu2 3, 112 trp l canl 100 ura3 l his3 11,15 was obtained from R. Rothstein, A138 a PH05 2 pho80 2 was obtained from P. Hansche 9 and R6 3A apho4 was from A. Toh e Tohe et al., 1981 J. Bact. 145, 221 232 . Strains from this work are P1 22 a pho80 trpl ade2 his3 leu2 , 29B5 ta pho80 pho4ts trpl ade2 his3 leu2 and 29A21 a pho80 trpl ade2 leu2 . One skilled in the art whould be able, in the practice of this invention, to substitute equivalent yeast strains. In the case of W301 18A another yeast strain may be used which has the trpl marker. Any pho4tS or pho80 mutant yeast strain may also be used in the practice of the invention. High Pi medium was YNB CAA YNB yeast nitrogen base ItCAAtl casamino acids 1 with adenine and uracil added when required. No Pi medium was UMD 6 plus uracil when required with no added inorganic phosphate. Both mediums lack tryptophan for selection of transformants. DNA and Plasmmids The PH05 gene was obtained from an 8 kilobase kb EcoRI restriction fragment shown to contain this gene 7,10 . The yeast E. coli shuttle vector, YRpl2, was from R. Davis Scherer and Davis 1979 Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci.76, 4951 4955 . The 0.56 kb EcoRI fragment carrying rIFN aD was obtained from Genentech, Inc., on the plasmid pFRS36 1 . The yeast gene for glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase was obtained by screening a yeast DNA library with the cloned chicken gene. Construction of Recombinant Plasmids Restriction endonucleases were from New England Biolabs and Boehringer Mannheim Biochemical, and T4 DNA ligase was from New England Biolabs. The enzymes were used as recommended by the suppliers. Synthetic BamHI and EcoRI linkers were from Collaborative Research. Generally stated, in order to construct a PH05 promoter expression vector a unique restriction enzyme site was introduced into the DNA region between the position of the 5 end of the PH05 transcript 18 and the initiator ATG by converting the TaqI site, shown in Figure 1, to an EcoRI site with a synthetic oligonucleotide linker. The resulting ClaI to EcoRI fragment with the transcription start site was inserted into the vector pBR322 6 along with the yeast TRP1 gene on a 1.4 kb EcoRI restriction fragment resulting in a plasmid similar to YRp7 11 with the PH05 promoter. Because DNA sequences upstream from the ClaI site are required for full expression and regulation of the PHOS gene, the additional ClaI fragment Figure 1 was inserted, and a segment of DNA from the naturally occurring yeast 2 micron plasmid 20 was added to increase copy number and stability of the vector.Finally, one EcoRI site indicated in Fig. 1 was eliminated. The resulting plasmid, pYE4, is diagrammed inFigure 2A. A cloned gene carrying an ATG initiation codon was inserted into the single EcoRI site in pYE4. Phosphate regulated transcription initiated in the PH05 promoter, proceeded through the inserted gene and terminated either in the 3 untranslated region of the inserted DNA or at the termination site for the TRP1 gene. Another plasmid, pYE7, was constructed in a similar manner Fig. 6 . In this case, the 2 micron DNA was inserted between the PH05 promoter and the TRP1 fragment, and the EcoRI site distal to the promoter was again deleted. In addition, the pBR322 sequences from the BamHI site to thePvuII site 1690 base pairs were eliminated. More specifically, the PHOS promoter expression vectors were constructed as described below. The BamHI to SalI fragment with the PHOS promoter 7,8 was prepared from an 8 kb EcoRI fragment isolated previously 7 Figure 3 . The BamHI to SalI fragment was partially digested withTaqI and a 540 bp BamHI TaqI fragment was isolated step 1,Figure 3 . The TaqI sticky end was filled in with E. coliDNA polymerase large fragment Klenow fragment and dCTP and dGTP step 2, Figure 3 . This fragment was then ligated with BamHI linker CCGGAATTCCGG and cut with BamHI and Clal step 3, Figure 3 . The 270 bp ClaI BamHI fragment was then ligated into a BamHI ClaI cut plasmid YRpl2 Scherer and Davis tls793 Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 76, 4951 4955 step 4, Figure 3 . Next, DNA from pYEl was cut with BamEI, treated with SI nuclease to remove the BamHI sticky ends and an EcoRI linker GGAATTCC was ligated on. The DNA was then cut withClaI and EcoRI and the resulting 270 bp fragment with the PHOS promoter was ligated into pBR322 19 cut with ClaI and EcoRI. The resulting plasmid Fig. 4 was then cut with EcoRI and the 1.4 kb EcoRI from YRpl2 with the yeast TRP1 gene and an ARS replication origin was ligated in step 1,Figure 4 . The resultant plasmid was then partially digested withEcoRI and plasmids in which only one EcoRI site had been cut were isolated. The EcoRI sticky ends were filled in with DNA polymerase Klenow fragment and dATP and dTTP.After ligation of the DNA, plasmids missing the EcoRI site shown in were selected step 2. Figure 4 . Next, the plasmid DNA was cut with P WII and NruI and an 1875 bp NruI to HincII fragment of the yeast 2 micron plasmid 20 from YEp24 Botstein et al. 1979 Gene 8.17 24 was inserted. The resulting plasmid was cut withClaI and the 1.1 kb ClaI fragment from the upstream regi.n of the PH05 promoter 13,18 was inserted to reconstruct the entire PH05 promoter regulatory region. The resulting plasmid was pYE4 Figure 5 . The vector pYE7 was constructed in a manner similar to pYE4 except that the 2 micron DNA was a 2.2 kb EcoRI fragment inserted into the EcoRI site. The promoter distalEcoRI site was removed as for pYE4. The plasmid was then cut with BamHI and the sticky ends filled in with DNA polymerase Klenow fragment. After cutting with PvuII. the remaining plasmid was ligated to form pYE7. shown inFigure 6. Note that the ligation of a filled in BamHI site and a PvuII site recreated the BamHI recognition site. To test these vectors, the 560 bp EcoRI fragment with rIFN oD 1 was first inserted in the correct orientation at the unique EcoRI site of pYE4 and a plasmid carrying the rIFN aD gene in the correct orientation for expression from the PH05 promoter, designated pYE4 D, was obtained.Figure 2B compares the nucleotide sequences of the 5 non coding regions of the original PH05 gene and of the PH05 rIFN oD fusion in pYE4 D. The extra CCGG sequence in pYE4 D between the former TaqI site TCGA and the EcoRI site GAATTC is from the synthetic linkers. Yeast cells were then transformed with pYE4 D by methods known to those skilled in the art for transforming yeast cells with plasmids. Generally stated, the preferred procedure for producing interferon. therefore, comprises a transforming a yeast organism with an expression vector containing the structural gene for a human interferon, preferably a leukocyte interferon, operably linked to a PH05 promoter regulator b cloning the transformed organism in a culture medium containing inorganic phosphate and essential nutrients for growth of the organism c decreasing the levels of inorganic phosphate present in the culture medium until said transformed organism is induced to produce interferon d lysing the transformed organism, and e recovering interferon from the resultant lysate. As will be further described in the examples, the yeast transformants were grown at 30 C in high P. medium to a density of about 3 x 106 cells ml OD600 nm 0.5 at which time half of the culture was removed and these cells were harvested by centrifugation. washed with sterile H2O and resuspended in no Pi medium. Growth was continued at about 300C and samples were removed at approximately 3 hour intervals for measurement of cell density OD600 nm andAPase activity 13 expressed as A420 nm units from a 30 minute assay per 1 OD600 nm unit of cells. Cell extracts for RNA 14 and interferon were also prepared. An alternative preferred procedure for producing interferon comprises a transforming a temperature sensitive yeast organism with an expression vector containing the structural gene for a human interferon, preferably a leukocyte interferon, operably linked to a PH05 promoter regula tor b cloning the transformed organism in a culture medium at a temperature of about 30 350C c decreasing the temperature of the organism to about 20 300C whereby interferon production is induced d lysing the transformed organism, and e recovering interferon from the resultant lysate. It is preferred that the temperature sensitive yeast organism is an acid phosphatase regulatory mutant strain ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae. As will be further described in the examples, the temperature shift transformants of this invention were grown in high Pi medium at about 350C to an OD600 nm of about 1. The culture was then divided in half. One aliquot was continued at 350C while the other was grown at 230C. Samples were removed at various times and prepared for analysis. For each time point, approximately 108 cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 1 ml of 7M guanidine HCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol and 1 mM phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride. An equal volume of acid washed glass beads was added, and the samples were vortexed for four 30 sec bursts. After 30 minutes on ice, cell debris and glass beads were removed by centrifugation, and the samples were stored at 200C. For interferon assay, the samples were either diluted 1 100 into 0.15 M NaCl, 20 mM NaP04, pH 7.9 PBS , or dialyzed into PBS. Interferon activity was detected by the reduction of cytopathic effect assay 15 .Activities are expressed in units per liter of culture of an OD600 nm of 1. Total RNA from each time point was subjected to electrophoresis in 1.4 agarose gels after denaturation with glyoxal 16 and transferred to nitrocellulose 17 . Hybridizations were carried out as described in 13 with 32P labeled probes. Example 1Regulation of interferon synthesis by PhosPhate concentration. Trp transformants of W301 18A carrying pYE4 D were grown in high Pi medium at 300C to an OD600 nm of about 0.5 at which time half of the culture was transfered to no Pi medium. At approximately 3 hours intervals, aliquots of each culture were removed and assayed for APase activity and extracts were prepared for interferon assay.Figure 7 shows that the level of interferon activity began to increase rapidly between 3 and 6 hours after transfer to no Pi medium and peaked at around 9 hours. This induction corresponded to the APase induction observed for the culture and represented a 100 to 200 fold increase over the interferon activity detected in cells grown in higher medium. RNA samples were prepared from both cultures at the same times that the interferon extracts were made. Following denaturation with glyoxal 16 , the RNA was fractionated on an agarose gel and then transfered to nitrocellulose 17 . Figure 8 shows the results of hybridization of theRNA blot with labeled rIFN aD probe. The appearance of rIFN aD specific transcript corresponds to the appearance of interferon activity observed in the extracts. Thus, the regulation of interferon synthesis seen here is at the level of transcription as is the regulation of APase 6,7 . In addition, the size of the rIFN aD specific RNA is about 1.5 kb, the size expected for a transcript starting in the PH05 promoter a going through the rIFN aD gene and terminating at the end of the TRP1 gene. Levels of up to 2 to 3 x 10 units of interferon activity per liter of culture at an OD600 nm of 1 were obtained. Example 2Regulation of interferon synthesis by temperature. To construct a yeast strain capable of temperature regulated APase induction, it was first desirable to eliminate the requirement for induction by low Pi. Yeast mutants in the PHO8O formerly known as PHOR gene, a repressor of APase synthesis, produce APase constitutively 9,21 . Therefore, a pho80 strain A138 was crossed with the trpl strain W301 18A used in Example 1. A pho80 trpl strain P1 22 was obtained and shown to produce APase in high P. medium. P1 22 was then crossed with a strain with a temperature sensitive mutation in the PH04 formerlyPHOD gene R6 3A . PH04 codes for a positive regulator ofAPase synthesis 21 and, therefore, pho4 strains are unable to produce APase even in low Pi. A temperature sensitive pho4 strain can be induced for APase only at the permissive temperature. A pho4 pho80 trpl host 29B5 was transformed with pYE4 D, and transformants were tested for temperature regulated interferon synthesis. Cells were grown at 35 C to anOD600 rim of about 1, and the culture was split into two portions. One continued to grow at 350C while the other was shifted to the permissive temperature 230C . At approximately 2 hour intervals, aliquots were removed and prepared for interferon assay. Figure 9 shows that interferon activity was at least 50 times higher in the cells grown at 230C. Significant interferon activity is observed only at the permissive temperature and the induced level reaches a maximum about 2 times higher than the final point inFigure 5, i.e., about 3 x 106 units per liter per OD600 nm Example 3Synthesis of interferon in yeast with pYE7. The 560 bp EcoRI fragment with the rIFN aD gene was inserted into the EcoRI site of pYE7 in the correct orientation to form pYE7 D. Alternatively, the rIFN cLA gene Goeddel et al., 1980 Nature 287, 411 415 on an 865 bpEcoRI PstI fragment was inserted into the EcoRI site of pYE7 after converting the PstI site to an EcoRI site with a synthetic oligonucleotide linker. The resulting plasmid with the rIFN oA gene in the correct orientation relative to the promoter was designated pYE7 A. The plasmids pYE7 A and pYE7 D were transformed into yeast strain W301 18A, and Trp transformants of each were induced as in Example 1. Samples were assayed for IFN activity at about 8 hours after transfer to no P. medium. 7Levels of 5 to 7.5 x 10 units of activity per liter perOD nm units were obtained for pYE7 D and 1.0 to 1.5 x 00 nm 10 units liter OD600 nm for pYE7 A. The somewhat higher level of rIFN Ã is probably due to the slightly higher specific activity of rIFN aA in the assay system. BIBLIOGRAPHY 1. Hitzeman, R. A., Hagie, F. E., Levine, H. L., Goeddel, D.
