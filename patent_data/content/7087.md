# Programmable control for load management.

## Abstract
A programmable control for load management of a plur ality of electrical power loads F is disclosed which contains at least two groups F1, F2 of load controllers for controlling the power supply to loads connected to various preselected load controllers. A group selector 10 selects which of the groups is functionally operative at any given instant in time based on environment or other criteria. A serial selector 20 commonly connected to each of the load controllers in the groups serially selects one of the load controllers in each group for conduction for at least one period of the serial selector. There is provided a first set of programming points D situated at the input to the load controllers. The program ming points are selectively connected by wires or diodes in any desired fashion to modify the conduction period or order of the various load controllers. A restart delay 30 mechanism is included, which is operative in the event of power failure, to delay the conduction on any of the load controllers for a period of time upon restoration of power.
