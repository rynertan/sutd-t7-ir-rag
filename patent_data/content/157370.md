# HEAT EXCHANGER PANEL AND METHOD OF MAUFACTURE

## Abstract
The invention concerns a heat exchanger panel for evaporator or condensor in a refrigerator. The panel com prises a plate 2 with several parallel running grooves 21 with converging walls 22 for locking of heat transporting pipes 3 . The invention furthermore concerns a method for manufacturing the heat exchanger panel comprising ex truding of profiled plates 2 with grooves 21 , placing of in dividual or connected pipes 3 in the grooves 21 and ex posing of the pipes 3 to plastic deformation so that their circumference conforms to and fills out the cavity of the groove 21 .
