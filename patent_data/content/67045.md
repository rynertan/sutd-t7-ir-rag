HEAT EXCHANGER This invention plates to heat exchangers for exchang ing heat between two fluids. The invention provides a heat exchanger for exchanging. heat between two fluids comprising an input manifold forth supply of a first fluid to the heat exchanger, an output manifold for the output of the first fluid from the heat exchanger, and at least one generallyU shape outer tube connected between the input and output manifolds for the flow therethrough of the first fluid, the diameter of the U being large azared to the tube diameter, the or each outer tube having a plurality of inner tubes mounted therein and extending therealong for the flow there through of a second fluid, each manifold having connection means for flow of the second fluid to or from the inner tubes. The direction of flow of the second fluid in the inner tubes is preferably opposite to that of the first fluid in the or their respective outer tube. The or each outer tube together with its inner tubes.may be detachably connected between the manifolds in this case, the or each outer tube conveniently has threaded connections with the manifolds. Each manifold may comprise means for the detachable connection of a plurality of outer tubes. The input manifold and output manifold may respect ively comprise a distribution pipe and a collection pipe, both pipes being in fluid tiotht communication with the interior of the or each outer tube. Each connection means preferably comprises a pipe in fluid tight connection with each inner tube but sealed from the space between each inner tube and the or its respective outer tube. Means is preferably provided for collecting condensation from fluid cooled in the heat exchanger. Ehe heat exchanger may form part of a gas dryer having a main heat exchanger for cooling the gas in order to condense moisture therefrom and a separator for separating the condensed moisture from the cooled gas, the first fluid beiRg incoming gas to be dried and the second fluid being outgoing dried gas, whereby the incoming gas is precooled before supply to the main exchanger and the outgoing gas from the separator is reheated. In such a gas dryer, the outer tubes are preferably arranged sustantially vertically, generally around the separator and to one side of the main exchanger. An embodiment of the invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawing, which shows in diagrammatic and partly cut away elevation an air dryer incorporating a precobler reheater heat exchanger embodying the invention. The air dryer comprises a main heat exchanger 1 for cooling the air to condense moisture therefrom, a separator 2 for separating the condensed moisture from the cooled air, and a precooler reheater heat exchanger generally designated 3 for transferring heat from incoming air to be dried to outgoing dried air emanating from the separator 2. The precooler reheater 3 comprises input and output manifolds indicated generally at 10 and 11 respectively and generally U shape heat exchanger elements 12 connected therebetween. Each elent 12 consists of a continuous outer tdbe 15 of smith seamless material enclosing a plurality of inner tubes 16 which are also smxkh and seamless. The tubes 15 and 16 are of uniform circular cross section. Dried air flows in the inner tubes 16 and incoming iticist air flaws in the reverse direction in the other tubes 15 while impinging on the exterior surface of the inner tubes 16.Thus the outgoing dried air is heated by the incoming moist air resulting in the latter being precooled before entering the main exchanger 1. In the embodiment there are two outer tubes each with only two inner tubes shown for simplicity, but there may be ten or more, typically twenty inner tubes, arranged in two circles concentric with the outer tube shell about a central inner tube. This latter arrangement gives an even distribcctfon of inner tubes and a balanced flow around these tubes for effective heat transfer. The number of inner tubes is limited by the allowable pressure drop of moist air flowing in the outer tubes and is chosen to equalize the precooler and reheater pressure drops. There need be only one outer tube with two or more inner tubes equally, more outer tubes can be added to increase the capacity of the precooler reheater 3. The heat exchanger elements 12 may be horseshoe shape or any other general U shape with ends that do not overlap. The input manifold 10 includes a distribution pipe 20 for the supply of compressed moist air to each tube 15 via stub pipes 21 connected to lateral apertures in the tubes 15. An outlet pipe 23 for the outlet of dried air from the dryer is also connected to the outer tubes 15 but is sealed from the interior thereof while being connected in fluid tight communication with the inner tubes 16.This is achieved by a blanking plate soldered in a coupling insert which is itself soldered in an expanded end portion 18 of each tube 15. The tubes 16 are soldered in holes through the blanking plate. The output manifold 11 includes a collection pipe 25 connected to stub pipes 26 which are connected in turn to lateral apertures in the tubes 15. The pipe 25 supplies the precooled moist air to the main exchanger 1 through a feed pipe 24 and distribution pipes 29, any condensate produced in the precooling process being drained off by a conduit 27 through a liquid trap 28 in which the condensate collects. An inlet pipe 30 also connected to the outer tubes 15 is in fluid tight communication with the inner tubes 16 while being sealed from the spaces between the inner and outer tubes, by means of blanking plates soldered in end portions 19 similar to those in the end portions 18. During assembly, overlength tubes are located in the holes in the blanking plates while the outer tubes 15 are straight. The outer tubes 15 with the inner tubes 16 are then bent to the required shape, after which the tubes 16 are soldered to the blanking plates around the holes therein and cut to length. The air is cooled in the main exchanger 1 by a refrigerant distributed through tubes 32 and discharged.7 through a tube 33. The cooled air flows from the exchanger 1 through pipes 35 and on through a pipe 36 into the separator 2 for separating condensed moisture from the air the condensed moisture is drained away through a liquid trap 38 by a conduit 39. The dried air is withdrawn from the separator through a vertical tube connected to the inlet pipe 30 and thereby supplied to the inner tubes 16 for reheating by the incoming moist air. All joints between tubes 15 and pipes 21, 23, 26, 30, between pipes 24, 29 and trap 28, and between pipes 36, 55, separator 37, trap 38 and pipe 30 respectively are screwthreaded. The pipes 20, 23, 25, and 30 may have provision for additional elements 12 and pipes 21, 26 to be connected up for increasing the capacity of the heat exchanger 3. The diameter of the U of the outer tubes 15 ta large compared with the outer tube diameter the ratio of these diameters is at least 5 1 and typically 8 1. This comparatively large diameter of U has the great adorntage of a very low pressure drop whole maintaining a compact conftgurationw Also, this U shape allows the exchanger elements to extend around other components of the air dryer and to one side of the main exchanger, giving an extremely compact structure. The smooth tubing also assists the low pressure drop. Baffles are often used in heat exchangers to induce turbulence in order to increase heat transfer, but such baffles greatly increase the pressure drop and are not necessary with the large radius turn of the U shape. R further advantage of the U shape of element is that elements may be replaced without difficulty, and extra elements may be added at the manufacturing stage to increase the capacity of the heat exchanger. The threaded joints have the a antage of allowing easy inspection, servicing and replacement of components.This feature is especially useful in allowing inspection of the brazed tube joints with the blanking plates.
