# Process for separating an ethylenically unsaturated hydrocarbon from a hydrocarbon mixture process for separating close boiling liquids process for inhibiting polymerization of styrene.

## Abstract
Process for separating hydrocarbons with double bounds styrene, butadiene, isoprene etc from hydrocarbon mixtures containing them by extractive distillation with an amine with more than one amino group e.g. N aminoethylpiperazine as solvent. N aminoethylpiperazine can also be used as solvent in the extractive distallation of close boiling liquids or as polymerization inhibitor for styrene.
