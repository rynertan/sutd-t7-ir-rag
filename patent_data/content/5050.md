# CARPET BACKING MATERIALS, PROCESS FOR THE MANUFACTURE THEREOF, AND CARPETS INCORPORATING SAME

## Abstract
The carpet backing materials comprise a woven, non woven or knitted thermoplastic backing fabric, preferably at least partially incorporating polyolefin, in particular polypropylene, yarns, to which a fleece is adhered by means of a hot melt powder adhesive having a softening point below that of the thermoplastic backing fabric. The fleece may, if desired, be pretreated to form a self supporting web prior to being adhered to the backing fabric. A process for the preparation of the carpet backing materials and tufted carpets incorporating the backing materials are described and exemplified. When incorporated into tufted carpets, the backing fabrics avoid the problem of grinning, and improve tuft locking and dimensional stability of the finished carpets.
