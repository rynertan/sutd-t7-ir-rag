# End cap assemblies for conveyor rollers.

## Abstract
A conveyor roller comprises a roller tube 35 fitted with end cap assemblies incorporating bearings 11 for rotatably mounting the roller tube 35 on a fixed shaft 36 . Each end cap assembly comprises a rigid housing having a cylindrical collar 13 adapted to be a push fit in an end of the roller tube 35 , the outer end of the collar 13 being spaced radially from the housing. The end cap assembly is secured in position by swaging the end of the tube 35 so as to force the outer end of the collar 13 radially inwards against the rigid housing. The collar 13 may be a close fit on the housing, or the housing may be moulded in plastics material and one end of the collar 13 embedded in the plastics during the moulding of the hous ing. The outer end of the collar 13 has a flange 26 which abuts the end of the roller tube 35 . The outer surface of the housing is curved radially inwards in the direction of the free end of the collar 13 to limit the deflection of the collar 13 . The separate collar can have a thickness adapted to any partic ular diameter of roller tube 35 , and may be connected to the housing by welding, adhesive or interengaging teeth or ribs to prevent relative rotation therebetween.
