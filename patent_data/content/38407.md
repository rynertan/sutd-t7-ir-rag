# CONTROL FOR HIGH TEMPERATURE ELECTRIC REFRACTORY FURNACE

## Abstract
A control apparatus, for starting and operating a high temperature electric furnace F for melting refractory materi als, includes a three phase power supply Phase A, Phase B and Phase C for supplying energy to three electrodes E1, E2 and E3 of the furnace. lncluded in the connections between the power supply and the furnace electrodes are three input transformers T1, T2 and T3 one for each phase. The primary of each transformer includes a tap changer section. Con nected between the power supply and the tap changer are two current paths connected in parallel. The first current path is non inductive. It includes at least one silicon controlled rectifier SCR A, SCR B and SCR C . This path is used after steady state conditions have developed. The second current path is highly inductive. The inductance is controlled by a continuously variable transformer BT A, BT B and BT C commonly known as a Varac. This path is used during start up. The combination, in series, of the tap changer and Variac controlled inductance in a second path which is used during start up, provides a vernier control of the voltage, and, hence, the current, applied to the furnace electrodes E1, E2 and E3 during start up, with the inductance providing protection against sudden current surges which would otherwise tend to blow fuses and open circuit breakers CB1, CB2 and CB3 .
