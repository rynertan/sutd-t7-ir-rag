# Video signal processing apparatus.

## Abstract
The video signal processing apparatus of the present invention is comprized of a video signal dividing circuit for dividing the input video signals into N channels, and a signal combining circuit for combining these N channel signals into the original unitary channel signals. There is disclosed an appararus for dividing video signals, wherein, in the process of dividing input video signals into N channel signals, the input video signals are written into a memory while write address control is performed in dependence upon clock sign als of the input video signals. These N channel signals repres ent N signal subsections divided from a section correspond ing to a predetermined unit time duration of the input video signals. Signals are read out from these subsections starting from the foremost data of each said subsection as read out address control cycles sequentially through these subsec tions. N latch circuits are used for sequentially latching signals read out from the memory with the aid of N latch pulses each having a frequency equal to 1 N times the clock signal fre quency and phase shifted relative to one another by a dura tion equal to the clock signal period. The output signals from the N latch signals are taken as said N channel signals. There is also disclosed a signal combining or restoration circuit, wherein, in the process of effecting image processing of said N channel signals as required, separately compressing the processed signals along time axis and recombining the result ing signals into single channel signals, the N channel signals are written into the memory as control cycles sequentially through the respective channels, and the N channel signals thus written into the memory are read out in the original signal sequence.
