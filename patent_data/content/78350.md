## Description
Sails for Sailing Vessels and Means for Storing andAttaching Sails to.Ma.s.t.s.or Stays This invention relates to sails for sailing vessels and to means for storing and attaching sails to masts or stays. It is known in this art to provide a sail with a boltrope at its luff the term boltrope and luff as used in this specification are defined in the next succeeding paragraph and to retain the boltrope, while the sail is in its hoisted position, within a groove in the mast. In such cases the luff is directly supported over its whole length, which is ideal insofar that loading is thus spread as uniformly as possible. A major disadvantage in this type of arrangement arises however during lowering and hoisting, since that part of the sail which has been lowered clear of the groove or which has not yet been fed into the groove is wild and can be difficult to handle, particularly in a strong wind. The term boltrope as used in this specification means any rope or similar flexible member sewn into or otherwise carried by the edge of a sail and the term luff means that edge of a sail which is to be attached to a mast or stay. It is also known in the art to replace the boltrope by a series of spaced slide elements attached to the luff of the sail, as disclosed in my British Patent SpecificationNo. 1,393,251. This arrangement enables the sail to be stowed in a storage receptacle comprising a grooved member or cartridge into which the slide elements can be automatically fed during sail lowering and from which they can be automatically withdrawn during hoisting. This effectively eliminates the handling difficulty referred to above. However, since the whole loading of the sail in use falls upon the slide elements, these have to be provided at quite close intervals and have to be made fairly substantial in size which in turn means that the stowage member or cartridge has to be longer and more massive than might otherwise be desirable. It is also known in the art to combine the boltrope with a series of slide elements attached at intervals to the boltrope and cooperating with a slideway which is provided on the forward wall of the boltrope groove and extends down the mast beyond the lower end of said groove to a point just above the attachment point of the boom gooseneck.This arrangement also effectively eliminates the handling difficulty referred to above, but because the slideway extends up the boltrope groove the slide elements remain captive when the sail is hoisted and are thus required to bear a part of the load on the sail, with attendent increased friction in operation. It is accordingly the object of the present invention to employ a combination of boltrope and slide elements in such a way that the boltrope alone is required to bear the load on the sail when the latter is hoisted and the slide elements are employed solely to retain the sail in its lowered condition. To this end, according to the invention, the boltrope groove in a mast or other sail carrying member is made large enough to accommodate both the boltrope and the slide elements with the latter completely free of any load or restraint, thus causing no extra friction and a second groove in the same or another sail carrying member is designed to accommodate only the slide elements and is so connected to and aligned with the boltrope groove that upon hoisting and lowering of the sail the boltrope and slide elements automatically move between their operative and inoperative positions. Thus, whereas in the closest known prior art the slide elements had not only to facilitate handling of the lowered sail but also to bear a part of the load when the sail was hoisted, the present invention divides these roles between separate elements the boltrope bears the whole of the loading on the sail when hoisted, and the spaced slide elements come into use purely and simply as means to facilitate handling of the sail during passage into and out of the second groove which may be formed in a stowage cartridge. Because the spaced slide elements bear no load in the operative condition of the sail, they may be more widely spaced on the boltrope and can be made small in size as compared with the slide elements of the prior art these factors allow a sail to be stowed in or on a cartridge of relatively compact dimensions. The spaced slide elements may each be made of synthetic plastics material and provided with its own individual selftapping screw driven into the boltrope. In order to make quite sure that its screw cannot be driven completely through the boltrope, or further into the boltrope than desired, each slide element is preferably provided with a spacing element which bears on the surface of the boltrope when the screw is driven home to the required extent. The spacing element may take the form of a skirt or shank formed integrally with the head of the element. Alternatively, each slide element may be formed integral with a split sleeve of synthetic plastics material, the halves of which embrace the boltrope and are secured together at their ends by rivets which also secure the sleeve to the sail. In another alternative, each slide element may be made of metal and provided with a split sleeve toWbe applied to the boltrope in a radial direction and secured thereon by crimping, the dimensions of said sleeve being such that after crimping, its inside diameter is smaller than the normal diameter of the boltrope and its free ends lie within the normal periphery of the boltrope. In this way, the sleeve so compresses that portion of the boltrope which it embraces that its free ends lie within the normal line of the boltrope and do not interfere with movement of the boltrope along the sail carrying member.Any tendency of the metal slide elements to rub against, and thus impede progress along and transfer between, the sail carrying members may be prevented by the provision of a second boltrope secured to the sail on the outside of the sail carrying members. Some embodiments of the present invention will now be further described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying schematic drawings, in which Figure 1 is a perspective view showing parts of the aforementioned sail carrying members in operative position in relation to a stay Figures 2, 3 and 4 are cross sections on the linesII II, III III and IV IV respectively of Fig. 1, these threeFigures additionally showing the aforementioned boltrope and spaced slide elements Figure 5 is a cross section through the boltrope and one of said slide elements on a larger scale Figure 6 is a cross section through a modified form of the boltrope groove Figures 7, 8 and 9 are side, end and perspective views respectively of a modified form of slide element in position on a boltrope Figures 10 and 11 are end views of another form of slide element before and after application to a boltrope respectively Figure 12 is a perspective view of the slide element ofFigs. 10 and 11 in position on a boltrope Figure 13 is a horizontal section through the rear portion of a mast with the slide element of Figs 10 to 12 in position and Figure 14 is a section on the line XIV XIV of Fig. 13 with the slide element rotated through 900. Referring first to Fig. 1, first and second sailcarrying members 1 and 2 respectively are shown in operative position relative to a wire forestay 3 of a sailing vessel.The member 1 hereinafter referred to as the foil is made of a suitable synthetic plastics material, is externally of general aerofoil shape and is formed with a channel 4 Fig. 2 which extends from end to end of the foil and which is of unvarying shape throughout its length. Access to the channel 4 is afforded by an elongate slot 5 which is defined by spaced lips 6 and which similarly extends from one end of the foil to the other. In its operative position shown in Fig. 1 the foil 1 is connected to an elongate compression member 7 of invertedU shape by a junction piece 7a which is detachably secured to the foil 1 and member 7 by screws 7b and 7c respectively, shown removed in Fig. 1. The member 2 hereinafter referred to as the cartridge is made of metal and is also formed with a channel to which access is afforded by an elongate slot. In an upper or transfer part of the cartridge, shown in 2a in Fig. 1 and in cross section in Fig. 3, the channel is indicated at 8 and lateral access thereto is by way of an elongate slot 9 defined by spaced flanges 10. The upper or transfer part of the cartridge, as best seen in Fig. 3, is also provided with a through bore 11 bounded on one side by the flanges 10 and on the opposite side by spaced shoulders 12, these defining an elongate slot 13 which constitutes an entrance to the through bore. A lower part 2b of the cartridge, shown in cross section in Fig. 4, has a channel 14 which is in direct communication and alignment with the channel 8 and the base of which is formed by flanges 15, an elongate slot 16 between those flanges constituting an entrance to the channel 14. When the cartridge 2 is put into alignment with the foil 1 as shown in Fig. 1 the channels 4, 8 and 14 form a single continuous channel having a lateral entrance by way of the aligned slots 5, 9 and 16. The cartridge 2 may be held manually in this aligned position but it is preferred to provide releasable fixing means for this purpose for example, a bearing socket 17 detachably secured to the member 7 by a screw 17a shown removed in Fig. 1 and a release clip 18 of U shape sliding along the member 7 into engagement with grooves 18a in opposite sides of the cartridge. In accordance with the present invention, a boltrope 19 is provided, as by sewing in for example, along the luff of a sail 20 and supports a plurality of spaced slide elements 21. The boltrope itself may be of known type, say ofTerylene, for example. The elements 21 are provided at regularly spaced intervals, and in the form shown in Figs.2 to 6 each such element is of collar stud or mushroom shape, having a head portion 22 and an interally formed shank or stem portion 23. These elements are of hard synthetic plastics material and each is secured to a self tapping screw 24 Fig. 5 . The cartridge 2 is used to stow the sail 20 when not in use, the elements 21 being accommodated in sliding relationship within the channel 14 with the boltrope outside the channel and the sail flaked. When it is wished to hoist the sail, the cartridge 2 is held or fixed in the aligned position shown in Fig. 1, a halyard is attached to the sail in the normal way, and the sail withdrawn from the cartridge by a sustained pull on the halyard, the elements 21 and the boltrope 19 thus passing from their stowage position directly into the channel 4 of the foil 1. Similarly, when the sail is to be lowered, the boltrope 19 is pulled downwardly, out of its engagement within the channel 4, until the elements 21 have been returned to the cartridge.Thus, at no time during hoisting or lowering of the sail is the luff out of control or wild at all times it is controlled by the elements 21 within channel 14 and or by the boltrope 19 within channels 4 and 8. It will be appreciated that when the sail 20 is in the hoisted position, all the loading on the sail is taken directly by the boltrope 19 and none at all by the elements 21. These elements are used simply as means to control the luff of the sail during hoisting and lowering, and as means to retain the sail in fixed relationship to a stowage member the cartridge 2 when the sail is not in use. Exactly the same principles apply to the modification illustrated in Fig. 6, the only basic difference being that this modification employs a foil 1 which is capable of accommodating two boltropes 19, 19a and hence two sets of slide elements at the same time. In other words, the use of a foil such as that illustrated in Fig. 6 allows a first sail 20 to remain in its operative position while a replacement sail 20a is hoisted. A separate cartridge 2 may be provided for each of the sails. In order to ensure that the sail is retained in its cartridge when the latter is removed from the stay, a permanent stop incorporated in or separate from the socket 17 may be provided at the foot of the cartridge but may be removed in the case of sails which can be reefed, such as mainsails.In addition, the head of the topmost element 21 or all such elements may be made oval or substantially oval in plan, rather than circular, and a narrow channel for the heads provided near the upper or transfer part of the cartridge, the width of the channel being slightly greater than the smaller transverse dimension of the head but smaller than the larger transverse dimension thereof. This arrangement would take advantage of the fact that in its stowed position the boltrope 19 naturally flakes into folds which extend across the longitudinal axis of the cartridge 2 at approxi 0 mately 90 to that axis.If the topmost element is so positioned on the boltrope that the larger transverse dimension of its head is aligned with the axis of the boltrope, movement of that element into the cartridge and the resultant flaking of that part of the boltrope through 0 approximately 90 will rotate the head through an equivalent angle in relation to the aforesaid narrow channel, with the result that the sail is prevented from escape through the head of the cartridge until such time that a pull on the boltrope aligns the head of the topmost element with the narrow channel once again. Alternatively, as shown in Figs. 7 to 9, each element 21 comprises a head 25 with a spherical under surface 26, an integral shank 27 and a split sleeve 28 which fits around the boltrope 19 and is secured to the sail 20 by rivets 29 passing through the enlarged ends 30 of the sleeve. In another alternative, shown in Figs. 10 to 14, each element 21 is made of metal and includes a shank 27 which may be coated with synthetic plastics material and a split sleeve 28, the ends of which are initially far enough apart for the sleeve to be fitted radially over the boltrope 19 before being secured thereon by crimping. It will be seen that after crimping the inside diameter of the sleeve is smaller than the normal outside diameter of the boltrope and that the adjacent ends of the sleeve on opposite sides of the split lie within the normal line of the boltrope. The element is thus firmly secured to the boltrope and will not impede its movement along the sail carrying members. In order to prevent the heads 25 of the metal slide elements 21 from rubbing against the cartridge 2 and so impeding its progress along the cartridge and its movement between the cartridge and the foil 1, a second boltrope 31 may be secured to the sail 20 outside the cartridge 2 as shown in broken lines in Fig. 11. A second boltrope will not be required when employing slide elements of synthetic plastics material. Although the exemplary embodiments described with reference to Figs. 1 to 6 relate to the attachment of staysails to stays, it will be readily appreciated that exactly the same principles can readily be applied to the attachment of mainsails to masts. All that is necessary in such a case is to provide the mast with a channel member or groove equivalent in function to that of the foil 1 the sail 20 and the cartridge 2 can be exactly as described herein. In the case of a sail attached to a mast, the cartridge or stowage may be made integral with or permanently attached to a lower section of the mast and the aforementioned stop means omitted, since sail changing is rarely required with mast supported sails such as mainsails and mizzensails and the transition from the cartridge groove to the boltrope groove is such as to require positive movement of the sail from one to the other. In Figs. 13 and 14 of the accompanying drawings this lower section of the mast is shown at 32 and it is illustrated how, when the element 21 is rotated through 900 on flaking of the sail in its lowered condition, the element is able to tilt in the groove and thus prevent jamming. Although in the specific embodiments of the invention described with reference to Figs. 1 to 6, the cartridge 2 is a straight rigid member, it can be made flexible, as envisaged and described in my British Patent Specification No. 1,393,251, so that a staysail can be set directly from its stowage i.e. without it being necessary to carry the sail forward manually. Thus one end of the cartridge can be anchored in its stowage position, on deck or in a sail locker and the other end simply brought into register with the foil I when the sail in question needs to be hoisted or lowered. Although its more evident applications to sailing vessels have been described it will be appreciated that the present invention is applicable in any circumstances where it is required to transfer a sail from a stowage position to a groove or grooves, such as on the yards of a square rigged sail, the spar of a lateen sail or on a gaff or boom.
