# FINE FLAW DETECTOR FOR PC BOARDS FINE FLAW DETECTOR FOR PC BOARDS

## Abstract
The circuit board is scanned by a video camera 11 supplying a video processor 12 to provide a serial stream of pixel bits each representative of a picture element within a particular scan line. These serial streams of pixel bits are configured into contiguous patches of n n picture elements and provided as inputs to logic arrays programmed to detect various types of flaws, by clocking the pixel bits into a RAM 15 with a capacity for 16 scan lines D₀ to D₁₅ of 2048 pixel bits per scan line. Each pixel bit position has an address given by a pixel clock driven address counter 16. A transceiver logic circuit 18 loads sixteen sixteen bit registers 19a 19p with pixel bits from the RAM 15 and also causes the stored scan lines to move successively from D₀ to D₁₅ registers in the RAM 15 . When fully loaded, the registers 19a 19p represent a 16 16 bit patches and their 256 outputs are decoded by programmed logic array flaw decoders 21 supplying flaw output signals to an OR gate 22.
