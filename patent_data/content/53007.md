# Photographic camera.

## Abstract
In a still camera of the 110 format cassette type, an electric motor is provided for winding on the film 58 and thereby priming the shutter by means of a mechanism 23,50 which engages a perforation 59 in the film as it passes and moves a shutter priming member. A switch 28,30 then disconnects power to the electric motor and the camera is ready to expose the next frame of film. In the event that the camera is operated without a film cassette inserted, a trigger mechanism 38,42 is provided which directly primes the shutter via a gearing mechanism from the motor. When a film cassette 56 is inserted in the camera. the trigger mechanism is inhibited and the shutter is primed only by the passing of a film perforation. Such an arrangement provides a very compact camera and allows the inclusion of an electronic flash unit, if desired.
