# Process of producing neodymium iron alloy and apparatus therefor.

## Abstract
A process and an apparatus for producing a neody mium iron alloy by electrolytic reduction of neodymium fluoride in a bath of molten electrolyte, consisting essentially of 35 76 by weight of neodymium fluoride, 20 60 by weight of lithium fluoride, up to 40 by weight of barium fluoride and up to 20 by weight of calcium fluoride, conducted between one or more iron cathode and one or more carbon anode. The apparatus comprises an electrowin ning cell of refractory materials coated inside with a lining resistive to the bath, the carbon anode of constant transverse cross sectional shape over its length, immersed into the electrolyte bath at its free and, the iron cathode of constant transverse cross sectional shape over its length, immersed into the electrolytic bath at its free end, a receiver placed on the bottom of the cell for collecting the produced neody mium iron alloy in a liquid state on the tip of the iron cathode, siphoning means for withdrawing the molten alloy pooled in the receiver out of the cell, and feeding means for feeding the ever wearing iron cathode into the electrolyte bath so as to apply the direct current to the iron cathode with a predetermined current density.
