## Description
OXAZOLYL SUBSTITUTED DIAZAMETEROCYCLES This invention relates to certain oxazolyl substituted diaza heterocycles which have been found to possess herbicidal activity, the preparation of such compounds, herbicidal compositions containing them, and to their use in combating undesired plant growth, Accordingly, the present invention provides a compound of the formulaEMI1.1 wherein Z is a bivalent group of the formula oo co , CO S , CO CHCH , or CH2 X CH2 X is an oxygen atan or the group N R3 wherein R3 is an alkyl group of from 1 to 3 carbon atans, or a cyclopropyl or methylcyclopropyl group one of R1 and R2 is an oxazolyl group of formula IIAEMI1.2 or, when Z is CO CO , or CO CHCH , may alternatively be the iscmeric formula IIB EMI2.1 and the other is an alkyl, haloalkyl or alkoxy group of 1 to 3 carbon atoms, a cycloalkyl group of 3 to 6 carbon atans or an alkenyl group of 3 to 5 carbon atoms. and R4 is a group containing 3 to 5 carbon atans which is an alkyl, alkanyl, alkynyl, alkoxyalkyl, alkylthioalkyl, alkylsulphinylalkyl, alkylsulphonylalkyl, cycloalkyl, alkylcycloalkyl or haloalkyl group provided that when Z is CO CHOH then h is not haloalkyl and R4 is not alkoxyalkyl and when Z is CH2 X CH2 then R4 is not beloalkyl, In these compounds, each alkyl, alkoxy, alkenyl and alkynyl Society suitably is either straight chain or branched chain in configuration. The term halo i.e., halogen designates one of chlorine, branine and fluorine. Preferred alkylthioalkyl, alkylsulfinylalkyl and alkylsulfonylalkyl moisties are those of the formula EMI2.2 wherein n is zero, one or two. Preferred compounds are those wherein one of RI and represents an alkyl or alkawy, especially methyl or methoxy, group and those wherein R4 represents an alkyl, alkynyl, alkoxyalkyl or alkylcycloalkyl, especially butyl, in particular tartiary butyl, ethynylpropyl, methoxybutyl or methylcyclopropyl, group. It is also preferred that the oxazolyl sustituent has the isaeric form given in formula IIA, especially preferred being such carps in which R4 is terary butyl. The invention also provides a process for the preparation of the compounds of the general formula I as defined above. For the compounds wherein Z represents CO CO , CO S , or CD CHOH, the compounds can be prepared by warming the appropriate urea of formula IIIEMI3.1 with, respectively, oxalyl chloride, chlorothio formyl chloride or glyoxylic acid conveniently as the hydrate , in the presence of an inert solvent. In the first two cases the reaction may be represented by the equation EMI3.2 In the third case the reaction may be represented by the equation EMI3.3 In same cases, because of the method of preparation, the urea reactant may be of the formula IVA or IVBEMI3.4 In sane cases, the alkylaminocarbonyl Society will be split off when the urea is heated in the presence of the chloride reactant. In other cases, it will be desirable, or necessary, to treat the urea of Formula IV with a base to split off the alkylaminocarlxmyl moiety before the urea is treated with the chloride reactant. This procedure is illustrated in Example 6, hereinafter. Treatment of the urea with oxalyl chloride or glyoxylic acid is conveniently conducted by adding the chloride or acid to a stirred solution of the urea in an inert solvent such as methylene chloride or toluene and refluxing the mixture for a sufficient tine to enable the reaction to go to catpletion. The hydrogen chloride by product in the first case may be removed as a gas as it is evolved, or absorbed by the incorporation of a hydrogen chloride acceptor such as a tertiary nitrogen base.The water by product in the second case is preferably ramoved as a vapour as it evolves. Treatment of the urea with chlorothio formyl chloride is conveniently conducted by adding the chloride to a stirred solution of the urea in a solvent at about roam temperature in the presence of a tertiary nitrogen base as hydrogen chloride acceptor, chilling the resulting mixture to about OOC, slowly adding the amine base thereto, then warming and stirring the mixture until the reaction is complete. In sane cases, it may be found to be deairable to use a disulfide R S S 8 Cl, whereinR is a hydrocarbon moiety or ester Cl S O O R instead of chlorothio formul chloride. In auch cases, the intermediate product is cyclized by heat, in the case of the ester the cyclization being catalyzed by a base. Those catpounds wherein Z is CH20CH2 can be prepared by treating the appropriate urea Formula III with paraformaldehyde in an inert solvent and in the presence of an acid, such as p toluenesulfonic acid, as catalyst, the reaction proceeding according to the equation EMI4.1 EMI5.1 The treatment is conveniently conducted by heating a mixture of the urea, the paraformaldehydet catalyst and solvent at a moderately elevated temperature for example, 60 900C. Aromatic hydrocarbons, such as toluene, are suitable solvents. If desired, a small amount e.g., 10 30 of the amount of the amine, on a molar basis may be included as a promotar. Those compounds wherein Z isEMI5.2 can be prepared by treating a solution of the appropriate ureaEMI5.3 in an inert solvent with aqueous formaldehyde and treating the resulting mixture with the appropriate amine, NH2. The reaction proceeds according to the equation EMI5.4 The a treatment is conveniently conducted by slowly adding the formaldehyde solution to a stirred solution of the urea in the solvent, at room temperature, cooling if needed to maintain the temperature of the mixture below about 35 C, then slowly adding the amine, again cooling the nixture if needed to maintain its temperature below about 350 C. It may be found desirable to warm the mixture for example, on a water bath, or even reflux it after the amine has been added, to ensure completion of the reaction. Suitable solvents are aprotic liquids, such as dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide and sulfolane.Workup of the reaction mixture, isolation of the product and its purification are effected by conventional techniques, as illustrated in the examples, hereinafter.

Compounds of Formula I appear to be effective when applied preemergance or preplant incorporated applied to the soil before the seeds have sprouted or when applied postemergence applied to the foliage of the growing plant . Some appear to be somewhat morse effective when applied pre emergence than when applied postamergence, Accordingly, the invention includes the use as a herbicide of a compound of formula I, and also a method of combating undesired plant growth at a locus by applying to the locus an effective amount of a compound of formula I. In the case where it is desired to control weeds in crop plantings, it is of course preferable to employ the lowest dosage that will control the weeds, for this will minimize any possible deleterious effect of the compound upon the crop plants. For application, the compound generally is applied most effectively by formulating it with a suitable inert carrier or surface active agent, or both.The invention, therefore, also includes a herbicidal composition comprising a carrier or surface active agent, or both, and as active ingredient at least one compound of Formula I, and a method of making such a compositicn which comprises bringing a compound of formula I into association with at least one carrier. A carrier in a composition according to the invention is any material with which the active ingredient is formulated to facilitate application to the locus to be treated, which may for example be a plant, seed or soil, or to facilitate storage, transport or handling. A carrier may be a solid or a liquid, including a material which is normally gaseous but which has been compressed to form a liquid, and any of the carriers normally used in formulating herbicidal compositions may be used. Preferably oompositions according to the invention contain 0.5 to 95 by weight of active ingredient. Suitable solid carriers include natural and synthetic clays and silicates, for example natural silicas such as distomaceous earths magnesium silicates, for example talcs magnesium aluminium silicates, for example attapulgites and vermiculites aluminium silicates, for example kaolinites, montomorillonites and micas calcium carbonate calcium sulphate ammonium sulphate synthetic hydrated silicon oxides and synthetic calcium or aluminium silicates elements, for example carbon and sulphur natural and synthetic resins, for example coumarone resins, polyvinyl chloride, and styrene polymers and copolymers solid polychlorcphenols bitumen waxes and solid fertilisers, for example soFxrFbosçbates. The term 1carrier as used herein neans an inert solid or fluid material, which may be inorganic or organic and of synthetic or natural origin, with which the active compound is mixed or formulated to faclitate its application to the plant, seed, soil or other object to be treated, or its storage, transport and or handling. Any of the materials customarily employed in formulating pesticides, herbicides, or fungicides, are suitable. Suitable solid carriers are natural and synthetic clays and silicates, for example, natural silicas such as diatomaceous earths magnesium silicates, for example, talcs magnesium aluminum silicates, for example, kaolinites, montmorillonites and micas calcium carbonate calcium sulfate synthetic hydrated silicon oxides and synthetic calcium or aluminum silicates elements such as, for example, carbon and sulfur natural and synthetic resins such as, for example, coumarone resins, polyvinyl chloride and styrene polymers and copolymers bitumen waxes such as, for example, beeswax, paraffin wax, and chlorinated mineral waxes solid fertilizers, for example, superphosphates and ground, naturally occurring, fibrous materials, such as ground cornnnas. Examples of suitable fluid carriers are water, alcohols such as, for example, isopropyl alcohol, glycols ketones such as, for example, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone and cyclohexanone ethers such as, for example, cellosolves aromatic hydrocarbons such as, for example, kerosene, light mineral oils chlorinated hydrcarbons such as, for example, carbon tetrachloride, perchloroethylene, trichloroethane, including liquefied, normally vaporous, gaseous compounds, Mixtures of different liquids are often suitable. The surface active agent may be an emulsifying agent, a dispersing agent or a wetting agent it may be nonionic or ionic. Examples of suitable surface active agents include the sodium or calcium Salts of polyacrylic acids and lignin sulponic acids the condensation of fatty acids or aliphatic ermines or amides containing at least 12 carbon atoms in the molecule with ethylene oxide and or propylene oxide fatty acid esters of glycerol, sorbitan, sucrose or pentaerythritol condensates of these with ethylene oxide and or propylene oxide condensation products of fatty alcohol or alkyl phenols, for example p octylphenol or p octyloresol, with ethylene oxide and or propylene oxide sulphates or sulphonates of these condensation products alkali or alkaline earth metal salts, preferably sodium salts, of sulphuric or sulphonic acid esters containing at least 10 carbon atoms in the molecule, for example sodium lauryl sulphate, sodium secondary alkyl sulphates, sodium salts of sulphonated castor oil, and sodium alkylaryl sulphonates such as dodecylbenzene sulphorate and polymers of ethylene oxide and copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide. The catpositions of the invention may for example be formulated as wettable powders, dusts, granules, solutions, emulsifiable concentrates, emLlsicns, suspension concentrates and aerosols. Wettable powders usually cantain 25, 50 or 75 w of active ingredient and usually contain in addition to solid inert carrier, 3 10 w of a dispersing agent and, where necessary, 0 10 w of stabiliser s and or other additives such as penetrants or stickers.Dusts are usually formulated as a dust concentrate having a similar composition to that of a wettable powder but without a dispersant, and are diluted in the field with further solid carrier to give a composition usually containing h 10 w of active ingredient. Granules are usually prepared to have a size between 10 and 100 BS mesh 1.676 0.152 mm , and may be manufactured by agglomeration or impregnation techniques.Generally, granules will contain w w active ingredient and 0 10 w of additives such as stabilisers, surfactants, slow release modifiers and binding agents.

Aqueous dispersions and emulsions, for example compositions obtained by diluting a wettable powder or a concentrate according to the invention with water, also lie within the scope of the invention. The said emulsions may be of the water in oil or of the oil in water type, and may have a thick mayonnaise like consistency. The Composition of the invention may also contain other ingredients, for example other comçounds possessing berbicidal, insecticidal or fungicidal properties, as are appropriate to the intended purpose. Protection of a locus or area fran undesirable plants is effected by applying a compound of Formula I, ordinarily in a composition of one of the aforementioned types, to soil in which the seeds of the unwanted plants are present, or to the foliage of the unwanted plants. The active compound, of course, is applied in an amount sufficient to exert the desired action. The amount of the carpound of the invention to be used in combating undesired plants will naturally depend on the condition of the plants, the degree of activity desired, the formulation used, the mode of application, the climate, the season of the year, and other variables. Recommendations as to precise amounts are, therefore, not possible. In general, however, application to the locus to be protected of fram 0.1 to 10.0 kg per hectare of the compound of Formula I will be satisfactory. The preparation, isolation and physical properties of typical individual species of the compounds of Formula I, in particular instances, are described in the following examples.In each case, the identity of the product, and each of any intermediate involved, was confirrred by appropriate chemical and spectral analyses.Example 1 1Methyl 3 5 tertiary butyl 1,2 oxazol 3 yl imidazolidinetrione 1 A solution of 41.5g of hydroxylamine hydrochloride in 136 ml of water was added drcp by drop over a 10 minute period to a stirred, reflexing mixture of 56.1 g of pivaloylacetonitrile British patent 2,014,992 , 700 ml of water and 525 ml of ethanol.
