# HIERARCHICAL ARCHITECTURE FOR DETERMINING THE LEAST RECENTLY USED CACHE MEMORY

## Abstract
A cache memory system includes a set of associative data memories 108 , 110 , 112 and 114 with associated tag memories 116 , 118 , 120 and 122 . The output of the Tag Memories are input to comparator circuits 144 , 146 , 148 and 150 to compare the most significant bits therein with the most significant bits on the address bus 124 . Each of the tag memories 116 122 is directly addressable by either a virtual or a physical address with the most significant bits of each ad dress contained in each tag memory. An LRU controller 172 controls the selection of the data memories 108 114 for writing data therein to determine which of the memories is the least recently used one. The LRU controller 172 is interfaced with an RLU memory 176 for storage of LRU data therein. In addition, fault information is stored in a fault memory 184 to prevent the LRU controller 172 from selecting a faulty memo relocation for writing of data thereto.
