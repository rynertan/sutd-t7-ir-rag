## Description
IMPROVEMENTS TO TRAILERS AND OR SEMI TRAILERS. The present invention is concerned with a trailer or semitrailer possessing a tipping system wherewith the container box and a chassis adopt appropriate positions such as to facilitate the loading and unloading operations to be performed, either at ground level or upon a lorry or other vehicle, where tipping can be accomplished even up to 900, and where the container box is capable moreover of being released from its chassis and from the tractor unit. With this arrangement, container boxes can be loaded, whilst the trailer or semi trailer structure when coupled to a tractor, conveys and or unloads other container boxes. The present invention also allows these trailers or semitrailers to adopt such a position that their over frame, which is joined to the container box, rests at one of its ends upon the ground, whereafter the chassis structure can be raised with respect thereto and describe an arc until it stands at right angles to the ground. For this it is necessary For the trailer or semi trailer chassis to be provided with a pivoted and sliding arrangement to enable it respectively to revolve about itself, and to slide upon the chassis. For there to be an actuator in the form say of a hydraulic or pneumatic cylinder, which is linked to the container box at its front end, and to the chassis at the opposite end. For said container box and its over frame to be pivotally joined together at their rear end, this being where the latter first rests upon the ground in commencing its rotation up to the maxi mum amplitude of 900. The invention is supplemented by a second hydraulic or pneuma tic actuating cylinder which, hereinafter being referred to as the brake cylinder, is located between the chassis and the wheel axle, about which the over frame is pivoted, and where said brake cylinder is able to lock said over frame and secure it in any one of the manifold positions it is able to adopt with respect to the pivotal axis between the two extreme positions Trailers and semi trailers that are fitted with the tipping system covered by this invention are essentially comprised of a special trailer unit with a particular chassis upon which there is mounted an over frame, and there are components joining the said chassis and over frame together, and at least two hydraulic or pneumatic cylinders provided respectively for operating and for braking the mechanism.One of these cylinders, this being the operating cylinder, links the chassis to the container box, and the other, this being the braking cylinder, links the chassis to its axis of rotation, and is able to restrain the relative motion between them at any of the manifold positions between the two extreme ones. In accordance with an additional feature of the present invention, the chassis and the over frame is complemented at each one of fits pivoted joints by a supporting foot which, together with said pivoted joint, the over frame itself, and a transverse bar, forms an articulated quadrilateral where said feet comprise, at any of the manifold positions up to the 900tip, the initial support for the subsequent raising of the chassis and wheels of the trailer or semitrailer. With the present invention, loading and unloading operations can be performed with one single trailer or semi trailer as follows Upon another vehicle, such as a lorry or another trailer in the transporting position, or upon a pile. See Figures 2 and 3 . At ground level See Figure 4 . By tipping up to 900 where the container box and the over frame adopt a position at right angles to the ground See Figure 6 . In accordance with the present invention, one of the ends of the unit, this being the rear of the over frame, is pivotally linked together with the container box, and is capable of undergoing with respect to this pivot point, relative angular motion between said container box and the over frame, whilst at the opposite end, which is the front end, the container box is joined to the end of the above mentioned operating cylinder, the opposite end thereof being linked to the chassis, and furthermore the over frame possesses a sliding arrangement between itself and the chassis allowing it to undergo travelling motion on a flat plane with respect thereto. In accordance likewise with the present invention, the overframe is pivotally linked to the axle carrying the wheels by means of two arms which in turn are pivotally linked to a transverse bar which, together with the very structure of the over frame and one of the supporting feet, this being pivotally linked to said overframe and said transverse bar, forms an articulated quadrilateral figure. With this structuring, all possible relative position variations between the chassis and the over frame can be achieved by means of the aforementioned set of cylinders1 wherein the operating cylinder makes the container box tip with respect to the chassis and, if applicable, with respect to the over frame, and the brake cylinder which locks the relative motion between the chassis and the over frame at any position in the range between the two ends, these included, and which respectively correspond to the trailer or semi trailer transport position, and the ground level loading position, and it is understood that said relative motions can be achieved in a variety of different positions provided always that fixed or moving points in both structures are linked together.The aforegoing preferred description is however given for certain specific positions in order to clarify the description. These specific positions which are adopted by the system covered by the present invention are those wherein the chassis, the over frame and the container box together take up the anchorage points necessary so that, in a series of motions, they can attain certain positions which are the optimum loading or unloading positions for any specific requirements. The present construction of the patent obviously includes all intermediate positions in the range between 00, which is the horizontal or travel position, and 900, which is the tipping or maximum angle position. Figure 1 depicts a semi trailer fitted with the tipping system covered by the invention, where oatie is in the travelling, that is completely horizontal, position, and this figure shows the pivot 100 between the over frame 9 and the container box 16 , as well as the assembly upon this container box 16 , and specifically on the front end of same, of the operating cylinder 10 , which is linked to the container box 16 in this area by means of a pivoted attachment head 11 . Figure 2 is a diagrammatic arrangement of a semi trailer in position in readiness to raise the box to the right level for loading or unloading upon or from another vehicle or a pile. Figure 3 is a diagrammatic arrangement of the container box 16 is one of its tipping positions once the front end thereof has been released from the over frame 9 . Figure 4 is a diagrammatic arrangement of the semi trailer covered by the invention in the semi tipped position ready for the rear end of the over frame 9 to touch the ground. This position allows loading from the ground to be accomplished, where the chassis 1 and the over frame 9 are kept slidingly attached to one another by means of the slide 15 provided on said over frame 9 . Figure 5 is a diagrammatic arrangement of the trailer depicted in the preceding figures, in a position that is intermediate to the vertical tip, where feet 12 rest upon the ground, and slide 15 is feed, thus freeing the front end of the over frame 9 with respect to chassis 1 , and allowing angular motion to take place between them about axle 4 which carries the wheels 6 . This position corresponds to the beginning of the maximum tipping position at right angles to the ground, and it is at this position where the chassis 1 structure carrying wheels 4 begins to rise. Figure 6 is a diagrammatic arrangement of the semi trailer depicted in the preceding figures, in the aforementioned maximum tip position at 904. To achieve this, it is necessary for the chassis 1 to remain raised with respect to the ground whereupon the end of the over frame 9 and the container box 16 are now resting. Figure 7 is an enlargement showing a preferred construction of the brake cylinder 7 mounted in relation to the chassis 1 and axle 4 about which it rotates, and which is capable of restraining the relative motion between them at any position. The present invention is concerned with a tipping system for trailers or semi trailers. In the construction illustrated, the tipping system on a semi trailer has been included. Nonetheless, this system can perfectly well be applied to a trailer without any alteration at all being made to be essential features of the invention. In accordance with the construction illustrated,the trailer or semi trailer tipping system being dealt with here possesses a semi trailer that is comprised of a chassis 1 provided with a rear axle 4 carrying wheels 6 . Chassis 1 acts as a, guide for a slide 15 which is invariably attached to the over frame 9 structure, and this overframe 9 in turn carries the container box 16 . The rear axle 4 carrying wheels 6 is pivotally attached to the chassis 1 and the over frame 9 by means of an arm 5 to points 51 and 52 . Point 51 corresponds with the semitrailer axle, and point 52 is a pivot point between arm 5 and over frame 9 . Each arm 5 , of which there are two, where one corresponds to each wheel 6 , has another pivot point 130 which links it with an arm 13 whose opposite end is pivoted at 120 to a support 12 , which in turn is pivoted at 90 to thevver frame 9 . The over frame 9 and the container box 16 are in turn pivotally linked together at their rear by means of shaft 100 . This invention is completed with two cylinders or sets of hydro pneumatic cylinders 7 and 10 , of which one 7 is a brake cylinder and is positioned on the chassis 1 where it links the semi trailer main axle 51 to the over frame 9 in such a way that it can stop the relative motion between them at any position. Hydro pneumatic cylinder 10 is fitted on the chassis 1 and the container box 16 at the front thereof, and is so by means of a pivot 11 on said front, where it can operate or not according to how it is commanded. In turn, the slide 15 is able to travel in guides with respect to the chassis 1 , and either move freely therealong after pin 151 is removed, in which case the over frame 9 and container box 16 are able to travel in an arc about the chassis 1 through operation of the hydro pneumatic cylinder 10 . In a practical construction of this invention, which is in accordance with the illustration shown in Figure 7, the plunger 71 in the brake cylinder 7 is linked to the main axle 51 by means of a strip 53 , pivoted at 531 to said plunger 71 and invariably linked to axle 51 , and said brake cylinder 7 is internally divided into two compartments which are separated from one another by an axially displaceable wall travelling with the plunger 71 itself, and which are in communication with each other through an outside pipe 105 which allows the fluid to flow from one internal compartment to the other at a rate set with a valve 106 , wherewith the speed and or thrust of this brake cylinder can be adjusted, and the motion stopped at any particular moment. With this arrangement, the trailer or semi trailer fitted with the present invention can adopt a plurality of positions ranging between an angle of 00, which is the travelling position shown in Figure 1, and a position at right angles to the ground, this being the tipping position at 900 as shown in Figure 6.Between these two positions which exist, it is feasible to set the semi trailer at all the intermediate ones and to stop it at any one of them by operation ofthe brake cylinder 7 . The most commonly used working positions are The travelling position Figure 1 . In this position, the tractor not shown coupled to the front of the semi trailer pulls it forward for travel. Raising position, in readiness for tipping onto another vehicle or onto a pile Figure 2 . In this position, arms 5 have ro tated with respect to the axle 51 of the semi trailer, and have raised the over frame 9 and the associated container box 16 with respect to the chassis 1 , for which purpose said over frame 9 and specifically its slide 15 has withdrawn linearly with respect to the chassis 1 . The height of the over frame 9 at the rear is sufficient to allow tipping or unloading onto another vehicle or onto any kind of pile. In this position, without releasing the chassis 9 , it is only necessary to operate the hydro pneumatic cylinder 10 in order to tip the container box 16 and cause the load to be discharged onto another vehicle or onto a pile Figure 3 . Tipped position Figure 4 . In this position, where arms 5 have revolved by a larger amount about axle 51 , the over frame 9 rests its rear on the ground, and slide 15 is in the fully withdrawn position with respect to the trailer or semi trailer chassis 1 , with respect to which, it travels linearly. In this position, loading from off the ground is feasible with the minimum amount of effort. Initial tip position Figure 5 . In this position, the shaft 151 frees the slide 15 on the chassis 1 , and thus causes the over frame 9 to travel in an arc with respect to the chassis 1 itself, in the same way as does the container box 16 attached to over frame 9 . The arc travel motion of the over frame 9 and container box 16 with respect to the chassis 1 as caused by the hydro pneumatic cylinder 10 , after arms 5 have been locked in position with respect to the chassis 1 due to the action of the brake cylinder 7 , causes the supporting feet 12 at a first point, to enter into contact with the road surface upon which the semi trailer wheels 6 are at rest. When the hydro neumatic cylinder 10 travel continues, the over frame 9 and the container box 16 go on tipping until the rear of them comes into contact with the ground. Wheels 6 and the chassis 1 are raised off the ground, and the maximum position obtainable in this stage is at right angles to the ground for a 900tip. Figure 6 .In the working stages where the over frame 9 and the container box 16 travel in an arc with respect to the chassis 1 , said container box 16 and over frame 9 are attached together at their front end so that there is no relative motion between them.In the working stages where the over frame 9 and the container box 16 have no travel motion in and are with respect to the chassis 1 , said container box 16 and over frame 9 are attached to the chassis 1 by means of the slide 15 which allows them to travel slidingly with respect to one another.
