# SANDMILL ROTOR DISCS

## Abstract
A rotor disc 18 for a sand mill is formed with a rim 38 which is considerably thicker in the axial direction than the web 36 extending between the rim and the hub of the disc. This improves the milling operation and extends the life of the disc. Forming the rim and hub of an abrasively tough, high molecular weight material, such as polyethylene instead of steel, further extends the life of the rotor disc by reducing wear and also reducing contamination of the product being processed. Ceramic materials also provide excellent wear ability.
