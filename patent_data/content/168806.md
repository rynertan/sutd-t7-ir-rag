# Improved life preserver device.

## Abstract
The improved device 10 includes a hollow container with latched door, inside of which is coiled an inflatable body contoured gas bag 28 releasably connected to the container and gravity deplovable through the door. The de vice includes valves 36 , conduits and the like to automati cally or manually inflate and deflate the bag 28 . The con tainer is adapted to fit into the back of an airliner seat 26 and when in that position and inflated acts as an effective crash barrier for a passenger sitting behind the bag 28 . A strap 44 or the like is also provided for releasably securing the bag 28 to a person as a flotation device when the need arises. Therefore, the bag 28 serves a dual function. The bag, when inflated, includes an upper horizontal portion with head receiving opening and a vertical lower portion with end panel sides adapted to receive a passenger s up per torso. The bag can include two sections releasably se cured front to back, both of which act as the crash barrier and one of which acts as an individual flotation device.
