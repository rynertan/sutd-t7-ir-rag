# HIGH HEAD CENTRIFUGAL SLICING SLURRY PUMP

## Abstract
A booster propeller 15 is located in a flared funnel 28 leading toward inlet apertures 14 in an end plate 13 of a centrifugal pump casing 5 . Such propeller has radially projecting blades 16 of generally triangular cross section for propelling slurry toward the apertures. The end plate is recessed into the impeller receiving bowl 6 of the pump casing. The inner face of the end plate is flush with the adjoining inner face of the peripheral pump outlet conduit 18 . The impeller 7 has vanes 10 projecting toward the end plate and having cupped leading surfaces forming a sharpened edge. Such blades are swept back in the area of the end plate inlet apertures for effective slicing of solid material in the slurry in combination with edges of the inlet apertures. The pump bowl has a semicylindrical wall portion closely encircling the impeller before the wall spirals volutely outward to the outlet conduit.
