# Thin film electromagnetic read write head structure.

## Abstract
A thin film, floppy and compliant, electromagnetic, read write head structure which is adapted to be pressed against a magnetic imaging medium during reading and writing. Individual heads and associated structure are dis tributed like bumps on one face of a support substrate the opposite face of which is the one designed to contact a medium. Other bumps, some connected functionally with the heads, and others isolated from the heads, are distri buted over the same first mentioned substrate face in a manner whereby they cooperate with the head bumps to minimize preferential point pressure telegraphing through the substrate to a recording medium during compliant pressure biased contact with such a medium.
