# Solderless circuit board conductor and connector assemblies employing same.

## Abstract
A solderless, generally elongated, circuit board conduc tor 10 adapted to be received and held in a plated through hole 21 formed in a circuit board 20 in order to provide an electrical connection between a conductive plating 25 deposited on the interior surface of the hole and another circuit element. The conductor includes a compliant section 13 which is adapted to be received in the hole in contact with the plating and allowing selective insertion and removal of the conductor into and out of the hole. The compliant section generally comprises a plate 14 with a resilient finger 18 struck out therefrom. The finger has an apex portion 30 to contact the plating 25 of the hole.
