# Vehicle level control system.

## Abstract
A level control system for a motor vehicle with an unsprung mass including a wheel 10 , a sprung mass, and a shock absorber 14 connecting the sprung and unsprung masses comprises fluid power apparatus 18, 19, 20, 21 activatable to level the sprung mass with respect to the unsprung mass, a sensor 24 effective to generate a signal indicating the level of the sprung mass relative to the unsprung mass and apparatus 22 responsive to the sensor to compute the difference between the total times, within a predetermined time period, spent by the level above and below a predetermined trim band and apparatus 22 effective to compare the difference of the times with a reference comprising a predetermined percentage of the pre determined time period and activate the fluid power apparatus if the difference exceeds the reference in magnitude, whereby the system can maintain a narrow trim band while the vehicle is not moving while avoiding unnecessary corrections and cycling due to excursions above and below the trim band during vehicle movement over rough surfaces.
