# Apparatus for laser welding pipes and the like.

## Abstract
Laser welding apparatus includes a first mirror 20 whose angle may be adjusted but which is fixed in position and on which a laser beam is incident. The first mirror 20 reflects the laser beam onto a second mirror 26 which may be rotated through at least 180 about the axis of the articles to be welded and which reflects the laser beam onto a third mirror 36 whose angle may be adjusted and which may be rotated through at least 360 about the axis of the articles to be welded. The laser beam then passes to a focussing mirror 40 which focusses the beam through a welding nozzle 14 onto the surfaces to be welded. In use, the third mirror 36 is conti nuously rotated about the entire periphery of the articles to be welded and the positions and or angles of all the mirrors are ad justed to ensure that the laser beam is transmitted along the desired pathway.
