# RATCHET OPERATED JACKS

## Abstract
The jack comprises a base 1 having a rack 1c , an inverted U section load lifting arm 5 slidable horizontally on a pivot pin 12 in guide channels 1a of the base 1 , a strut 6 pivoted to the lifting arm 5 and to the base 1 , a jacking arm 4 pivoted on the pin 12 and carrying a jacking pawl 2 which co operates with the rack 1c to lift the load in steps and a locking pawl 3 which transfers the load on the lifting arm 5 to the rack 1c between the stepwise jacking movements. During load lowering, the pawls 2, 3 are alter nately raised by a spring 9 and during load raising the action of spring 9 is overcome and both pawls 2, 3 are biased into engagement with the rack 1c by a raising spring 8 . Preferably, a slider 30 automatically pivots the spring 8 to an inoperative position when the jack is fully raised and into an operative position when the jack is fully lowered.
