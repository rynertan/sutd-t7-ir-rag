# Apparatus and method for controlling focus in a recording system.

## Abstract
A control system for maintaining focus of a radiant recording or writing beam, with respect to a recording surface, by measurement of the duty cycle of an informationcarrying signal recorded from the surface immediately after recording. The system includes a photodetector for detecting a beam used to recover the information, a focusing lens to focus the beams, a dither oscillator to generate a signal employed to move the lens, a duty cycle detector to provide a signal indicative of the information carrying signal and a multiplier for comparing the phases of the two signals, and thereby providing a correction signal indicative of the magnitude and polarity focus error. This control system provides fine focus control, and is utilized in conjunction with a coarse focus control for the movable lens. In addition, the signal form the duty cycle detector can be coupled to maintain the power of the writing beam at an optimum level and the duty cycle at a constant level, such as fifty percent.
