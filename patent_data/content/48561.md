# An optical waveguide connector assembly.

## Abstract
An optical waveguide connector assembly comprises a tubular body 10 , an alignment ferrule 12 mounted on a forward end portion 38 of the body 10 , an internal ferrule 8 assembled within the body 10 , an optical cable having an optical waveguide 20 projecting through a forward end 28 of the internal ferrule 8 . The internal ferrule 8 and the waveguide are inserted into the body 10 with the waveguide projecting through the body 10 and the alignment ferrule 12 . The forward end 28 of the inner ferrule 8 is tapered and wedges sealably against internal tapered walls 44 of the body 10 and seals against migration of adhesive material 50 along the length of the waveguide 20 . The waveguide 20 forward end is made flush with a forward end of the alignment ferrule 12 .
