# Air pressure operated proximity sensor and counting apparatus incorporating same.

## Abstract
The disclosure relates to an air pressure sensor for use particularly in a batched counting apparatus for counting sheets or signatures in a shingled stream and comprising an air passage 21 terminating in a probe 17 having an orifice 19 to ride over the surface of the shingled stream of sheets. The jet 26, 27 delivers air from a supply line into the passage and branch passage 28 located adjacent the jet contains a floating element 31 which moves up and down the passage in accordance with static air pressure in the passage. The element is arranged to make or break a beam in a photo electric cell arrangement 12 to operate a counting device. As the probe rides from one sheet or signature to the next, the air pressure in the passage 21 drops and the result in the fall in pressure in the branch passage causes the element 31 to fall thereby triggering the photo electric cell to operate the counting device. The sensor is extremely sensitive, responding when passing from sheet to sheet of very thin paper and it is capable of operating at high speed.
