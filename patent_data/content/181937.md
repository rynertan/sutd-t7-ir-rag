# APPARATUS FOR REPRODUCING RECORDED INFORMATION FROM RECORDING DISK.

## Abstract
An apparatus for reproducing recorded information from a recording disk is arranged as follows. A record case which has at one end thereof an opening through which a disk shaped recording medium can come in and out is in serted into the apparatus body as far as a predetermined position in a state of having a disk shaped recording medium housed therein. Then, only the record case is re moved, whereby the recording medium is left inside the apparatus body. The reproducing apparatus is further ar ranged such that the record case is allowed to be inserted into the apparatus body as far as a predetermined position only in a predetermined state wherein the opening formed in the record case being inserted into the apparatus body is expanded and the record case is retained by a retainer means provided inside the apparatus body, whereby inser tion of the record case in an incomplete state is prevented.
