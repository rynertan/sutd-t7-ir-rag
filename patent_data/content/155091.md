# Apparatus and method for inhibiting nasal secretions.

## Abstract
Apparatus for inhibiting nasal secretions by selective neural stimulation applies an electrical signal to a selected neurally sensitive area of the oral cavity. A method for in hibiting nasal secretions includes the steps of applying an electrical signal to a neurally sensitive area in the oral cavity, such as on opposite sides of the frenulum and beneath the philtrum.
