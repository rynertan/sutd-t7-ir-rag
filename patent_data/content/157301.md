# Boot for universal joint.

## Abstract
Herein disclosed is a boot 13 for a universal joint, which is made of a high molecular elastomer, in which bel lows having three or more ridges 14, 16, 17 are extended between a larger and a smaller ring portion 11, 12 and in which a valley 15 is formed between the first ridge 14 from the larger side of the bellows and the larger ring por tion 11 . In this boot 13 , the crest of the first ridge 14 has its inner circumference located outside of the imaginary cir cumference of the frustum of a cone c , which is formed by joining the end portion of the larger ring portion 11 at the side to be connected to the bellows and the crest of the se cond ridge 16 . As a result, the wears of the ridges espe cially of the first ridge 14 due to their mutual contacts are not promoted so that the boot 13 can have its durability im proved.
