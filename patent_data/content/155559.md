# Process for production of isocyanurate ring containing polyisocyanate and resin composition for urethane paints comprising said polyisocyanate and acrylic polyol.

## Abstract
A process for producing a polyisocyanate containing an isocyanurate ring, which comprises reacting at least one diisocyanate compound selected from the group consisting of alkylene diisocyanates, cycloalkylene diisocyanates and aralkylene diisocyanates with a diol having a molecular weight of 100 to 1,000 and containing at least 3 hydrocarbon substituents per molecule in the presence of an isocyanurat ing catalyst. A resin composition for urethane paints com prising the polyisocyanate as an essential ingredient.
