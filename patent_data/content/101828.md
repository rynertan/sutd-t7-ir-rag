# Plasma etch chemistry for anisotropic etching of silicon.

## Abstract
A plasma etch chemistry which allows a near perfectly vertical etch of silicon is disclosed. A Cl containing com pound such as BCl₃ has Br₂ added to it, readily allowing anisotropic etching of silicon. This is due to the low volatility of SiBr₄. The silicon surface facing the discharge is subjected to ion bombardment, allowing the volatilization etching of silicon as a Si Cl Br compound. The Br which adsorbs on the sidewalls of the etched silicon protects them from the etching. This new plasma etch chemistry yields a very smooth etched surface, and the etch rate is relatively insensitive to the electrical conductivity of the silicon.
