# Production of hydrogen sulfide from sulfur dioxide obtained from flue gas.

## Abstract
This invention is a process for producing gaseous hydrogen sulfide in concentrated form from sulfur dioxide obtained from a dilute gas source, thus purifying the gas source, by 1 reacting the SO₂ with Na₂CO₃ to form Na₂SO₃, 2 reducing the Na₂SO₃ to Na₂S, 3 reacting the Na₂S with NaHCO₃ to form H₂S and Na₂CO₃, 4 recycling part of the Na₂CO to the SO₂ reaction step, 5 reacting the remainder of the Na₂CO₃ with CO₂ and H₂O to form NaHCO₃ and 6 recycling the NaHCO₃ to the H₂S formation reaction. Nitrogen oxides may be removed from the gas source at the same time.
