# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR THE DIMENSION INSPECTION OF SOLID BODIES

## Abstract
For the dimension and irregularity inspection of the edges of solid bodies delimited by at least two plane and parallel surface, the body itself is struck by a blade laser beam which is slanted with respect to the side of the body and is formed by parallel rays on a perpendicular plane to the sur face planes of the body. The beam which is reflected back from the side of the body is received by a TV camera through a reflecting mirror, so that the TV camera receives the dimen sions of the lateral height while a second TV camera aligned with the axis of the body, receives the diffracted rays from the upper edge thereby enabling a control of the dimensions and any irregularies present.
