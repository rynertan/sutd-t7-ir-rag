# Camera having an exposure control mechanism.

## Abstract
A camera has a simplified exposure control mechanism 282, 448, 456, 486, 488 in which the mode, for example, the direction of rotation, of a motor 448 determines exposure condition in response to scene luminance. The same motor 448 also forms part of or cooperates with a shutter release mechanism 512, 540, 542 and a film advance mechanism 436 which are operated by the motor 448 noncontempor aneously with each other and with the operation of the exposure control mechanism.
