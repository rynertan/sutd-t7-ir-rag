# Improvements in hydraulic anti skid braking systems for vehicles.

## Abstract
In an anti skid braking system a modulator 3 for modulating the supply of hydraulic fluid from a master cylinder 1 to a brake 2 incorporates a flow control regulator valve 6 and an exhaust valve 5 which is responsive to signals from skid sensing means 9 . When the exhaust valve 5 is closed the valve 6 is in a first position to permit unrestricted direct flow through it and when the exhaust valve 5 is open a variable orifice in the valve 6 provides a restricted flow through it. The exhaust valve 5 and the valve 6 are only connected hydraulically and a conventional inlet valve normally operated directly by the skid sensing means is omitted. The construction is therefore simplified since relative position tolerances are otherwise eliminated.
