# CONNECTION TERMINAL ASSEMBLY EMPLOYABLE FOR IONIC ACTIVITY DETECTOR

## Abstract
A connection terminal assembly which is arranged in an ionic activity analyzer and which is employed in contact with a plurality of solid state type ion selective electrode as semblies ionic activity detector slides which comprises plural pairs of ion selective electrodes each pair of which develops an electric voltage specific to the ionic activity of an ion, for measurement of the ionic activity of an ion em ploying the ionic activity analyzer, wherein the connection terminal assembly comprises at least three connection ter minals, the therminals being supported by a support which is the framework of the connection terminal assembly, re sultantly allowing the simultaneous measurement of at least two different kinds of ions for the ionic activity analyzer.
