# A POWER CONVERTER FOR A MOTOR CONTROL SYSTEM

## Abstract
An AC motor drive includes a power converter 10 to 53 which supplies current to a DC bus 3 from three phase power lines 4, 5, 6 . An inverter 2 drives the motor 1 from power delivered to the DC bus 3 and it regenerates power to the DC bus 3 when the motor 1 is decelerated. The power converter 10 to 53 in turn regenerates the power to the power lines 4, 5, 6 by controlling line current such that it is substantially in phase with the applied line voltages. Current overload protection 60 to 64 is provided for the transistor switches 16 to 21 employed in the power converter bridge circuit.
