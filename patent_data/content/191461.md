# REARVIEW MIRROR FOR THE ATTACHMENT TO THE OUTSIDE OF A VEHICLE

## Abstract
The rearview mirror for the attachment to the outside of a vehicle comprises a frame structure 21 enclosing a mir ror disk 60 which is adjustable in its position in relation to the frame structure 21 and an enclosure 30 , the longitudi nal edges 40, 41 of which are substantially parallel to each other. The enclosure 30 extends from the part 24, 25, 26 of the periphery of the frame structure 21 not facing the ve hicle over a length sufficient for shielding against rain and other contaminants but scarcely impairing the angle of view to the rear. The contact plane with the side windowpane 59 of the vehicle is defined by at least the upper longitudinal edge 41 of the enclosure 30 and the lateral front edge 27 of the frame structure 21 facing the vehicle. Thus, the frame structure 21 and the enclosure 30 prevent contact of rain or other contaminants with the mirror disk and the part of the windowpane covered by the rearwardly open longitudinal part of the enclosure 30 , permitting so an un disturbed view of the scene in the rearview mirror.
