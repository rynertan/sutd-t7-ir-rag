# BUBBLE MEMORY WHICH TRANSFERS BUBBLES IN BOTH RIGHT TO LEFT AND LEFT TO RIGHT SPS LOOPS TO PROVIDE A SHORT ACCESS TIME

## Abstract
A bubble memory comprises a substrate with a major sur face a first storage means for storing bubbles on the left side of the surface having parallel inputs and parallel outputs a sec ond storage means for storing bubbles on the right side of the surface having parallel inputs and parallel outputs a first input means on the left side of the surface including a serial parallel track along which the bubbles move to the right to enter the parallel inputs of the first storage means a second input means on the right side of the surface including a serial parallel track along which the bubbles move to the left to enter the parallel inputs of the second storage means a means for detecting bubbles disposed equally on the left side and the right side of the surface a first output means on the left side of the surface including a parallel serial track which receives bubbles from the parallel outputs of the first storage means and moves them to the right to the detector and a second output means on the right side of the surface including a parallel serial track which receives bubbles from the parallel outputs of the second stor age means and moves them to the left to the detector.
