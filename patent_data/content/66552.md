## Description
BACKGOUND OF TEE INVENTION The present invention relates to a method for determining the creatinine contents in biological liquids and to a reagent for carrying out The method. As it is well known, the creatinine contents in biological liquids is conventionally determined by means or the Jaffé reaction see Jaffé M Zschr. Physiol Chem.10.391 1886 which is based on the creatinine property of reducing The picric and picramic acids in an alkaly solution and providing a red orange solution.More specifically The concentration of the reaction product is determined by colorimetry at a wave length of about 510nm.The analysis can be carried out at equilibrium conditions end point either by means or a preliminary deproteinizing step or without using any steps or this type,and under kinetic conditions rixed time without any deproteinizing steps. A drawback which is common to all of These methods is the inherent lack of specificity or the chemical process, since the reduction or picric acid to picramic acia is not a characteristic peculiar to creatinine and, therefore, it may also be caused by other substances present in biological liquids, such as many metabolism compounds related to creatinine Thus the data reproductibility based on methods musing The same principle is a very poor one.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly the task or the present invention is to obviate The mentioned drawback by providing a new method ror determining the creatinine contents or concentration in biological liquids effective to allow ror a high reaction speciricity to be obtained as well as highly reliable results about the creatinine amount contained in saia biological liquids.

Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a reagent ror determining the creatinine contents or concentration in biological liquids which is effective to carry out the above mentioned method. According to one aspect or the present invention The mentioned task and objects as well as yet other objects which will become more apparent thereinafter are achieved by a method ror determin ing the creatinine contents or concentration in biological liquids characterized in that it comprises the steps or enzymatically transtorming creatinine to glycine,acetaleehyde and hydrogen peroxide and proportioning one of the reaction end products. Advantageously the proportioned product is the hydrogen peroxide, which is proportioned by using a conventional proportioning method, such as titration, potentiomet ric methods, colorimetric methods or enzymatic methods or the like. preferably said hydrogen peroxide is enzymatically proportioned, by using catalasis or peroxydasis in the presence or compounds effective to provide a chromogen compound which is colorimetrically analyzed. Advantageously The enzymes used in the instant method for determining the creatinine contents or concentration consist of the creatinineamidonydrolasis effective to transform creatinine into creatine by audition ol water, the creatine amidohydrolasis effective to transform creatine into urea and sarcosine by addition or water and the sarcosineoxydasis wfiich,also by aadition or water, is effective to transform sarcosine into glycine, acetaldehyde and hydrogen peroxide. in particular The compounds effective to provide a chromogen compound upon catalasis or peroxydasis are 4 aminophenazone and the like, phenol and the halogenated derivavives There or, or aromatic amines.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS With reference to the figures of the accompanying drawing, the method for enzymattically determining the creatinine contents or concentration in biological liquids according to The present invention is based on The following reaction relationships Creatinine H2O Creatinineamidohydrolasis EMI5.1 CreatineCreatinine H2OCreatineamidohydrolasisEMI5.2 Urea Sarcosine Sarcosine H2OSarcosineoxydasisEMI5.3 Glycine Acetaldehyde H2O2 In principle, in order to determine the creatinine amount in The biological liquid, it is necessary to proportion one or the three reaction products, that is glycine, acetaldehyde or hydrogen peroxide. Preferably, due to practical reasons, There is determined the hydrogen peroxide amount,ror example by using conventional quantitative analytical methods, such as titration,potentiometric procedures, colorimetric and enzymatic methods and so on. The most preferred way is the enzymatic procedure,by using catalysis or peroxydasis which, in the presence of 4 aminophenazone or the like, phenol and halogenated derivatives thereof, aromatic amines,are effective to provide a chromogen compound having a maximum at about 51Onm. These reactions are generally indicated as of The Trinder type see Trinder P.J.Clin.Pat 22 158 1969 . Among the phenol halogenated derivatives 2,4 dichlorophenol, 2,4 dichlorophenolsulphonate, 2,6 dichlorophenol,2 bromophenol,2 chlorophenol, tribromophenol, 2,4 dibromophenol, 2,4 dibromophenol sulphanate,hydroxybenzoate have been round to be particularly erfective. Among aromatic amines, aniline, dimethylaniline, diethylaniline have been founa to be particularly effective. A particularly effective method ror determining the hydrogen peroxide amount is that exploiting The property of said hydrogen peroxide or oxidizing iodides, such as potassium iodide, to iodine which is determined colorimetrically at 365 or 405 nm or by filters near to this wavelenght . A very erfective method for determining the H2O2 amount is obtained by The action of peroxidasis on a mixture or 3 hydroxy 2 4 6 tri iodine benzoic acid and 3 methyl benzothioazoline hydrazone hydrochloride monohydra te . An example of a suitable reagent ror carrying out The abovementioned reactions will be described thereinbelow.
