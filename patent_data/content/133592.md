# METHOD OF PRODUCING A MODULATED CHROMINANCE SIGNAL WITH SUPPRESSED CARRIER AND COLOUR CARRIER MODULATOR ARRANGEMENT FOR PERFORMING THE METHOD

## Abstract
A method of producing a modulated chrominance signal with suppressed carrier. A square wave carrier signal and a colour information signal in the form of a sequence of digitally encloded amplitude values are applied to a modula tor arrangement. The clock frequency for the amplitude values is an integral multiple of the colour carrier frequency and is phase locked thereto. Each bit of the amplitude values is inverted during one half cycle of the carrier and not inverted in the subsequent half cycle. A first and a second value, respectively are added to the values obtained thus, these first and second values being calculated such that also for input and or output signal values which are located at a distance from the drive mean values at the input and output ends a total carrier suppression is achieved for the desired input signal level. The modulated analog chrominance signal is available after digital to analog conversion.
