# Water extractive distillation of olefinically unsaturated nitriles.

## Abstract
A process for purifying crude olefinically unsaturated nitrile, especially acrylonitrile, by extractively distilling the crude nitrile in the presence of water. Water is supplied in two purities to two locations within the extractive distillation column. High purity water is added to the top of the extractive distillation column while a portion of the water required for extractive distillation is added as a low purity water stream added to the extractive distillation column between the feed point and pure water addition point.
