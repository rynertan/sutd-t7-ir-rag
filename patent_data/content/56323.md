## Description
PACKAGING MATERIAL AND PACKAGES MADE THEREFROM This invention relates to materials for use in packaging, and more especially in producing sterilisable packages. It is known to produce a sterilisable package utilising a material which is a laminate of polyethyleneterephthalate and polypropylene PP or a low density polyethylene LDPE , bonded together by a suitable lacquer laminant such as a conventional polyurethane adhesive or a key coating. The PP or LDPE layer is needed to make the material heat sealable, e.g. to an adjacent plastics or paper layer. The polyester film is a preformed layer and is oriented in order to provide its crystallinity and strength and is not thermoformable, so that packages made from such materials are generally flat, e.g. a bag or pouch, which may be gusseted. The present invention provides a laminate for sterilisable packages comprising a cast polyester base layer bonded by a laminant layer to a heat sealable thermoplastic layer. Preferably the heat sealable layer comprises polypropylene, low density polyethylene, orSurlyn Trade Mark for an ionomer resin . The bonding layer is suitably an olefinic copolymer reactable and compatible with the base layer and heatsealable layer in which the weight percentage of an ester based comonomer in ethylene may vary from 3 upwards. A preferred range is from 16 to 40 by weight, a suitable example being 28 by weight. Suitable bonding layer materials include EVA ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer , EEA ethylene ethyl acrylate copolymer , EAA ethylene acrylic acid copolymer , EMA ethylene methyl acrylate copolymer ,EBA ethylene butyl copolymer , and modifications thereof, especially terpolymers with grafted maleic anhydride groups, or grafted co and terpolymers with PP, HDPE high density polyethylene and LDPE could be used. The bonding layer preferably has a thickness of from 16 to 24 microns, most preferably around 20 microns. Preferred materials for the polyester layer are PBT polybutylene terephthalate , PETG copolyester a glycolmodified polyethylene terephthalate , and PCTA copolyester a copolymer of cyclohexanedimethanol and terephthalic acid with part of the terephthalic acid replaced by another acid. PBT is especially preferred. The outer layers of the laminate could be separately made and then lacquer laminated using for example a polyurethane adhesive or key coat. Preferably, however, the layers are co extruded through a common die.This produces a very clear film, and the multi layer formation is readily thermoformable and is stable to normal sterilisation techniques. For steam sterilisation the preferred heat sealable layer is polypropylene whereas for gamma ray or ethylene oxide sterilisation the heat sealable layer is LDPE. The heat sealable layer should be capable of heat sealing to itself or to other layers such as paper or film which make up a package. A suitable package is made by thermoformng the laminate as desired, placing the contents within the thermoformed cavity, and then sealing the package with a medically approved paper layer. Alternatively a bag or pouch can be formed using the laminate in combination with a paper layer. The paper layer is especially suitable for steam or ethylene oxide sterilisation. The base layer has a relatively high coefficient of friction, and if it is desired that the packages should be able to slide over each other a slip agent can be incorporated in that layer, preferably as a master batch in the base layer material prior to extrusion. Suitable slip additives are stearates, amides and siloxanes.Preferred master batches for incorporation in the base layer are polyethylene fatty acid amide and polydimethyl siloxane polyethylene compositions. The incorporation of a slip additive usually has the effect of introducing a slight haze into the otherwise clear base layer. The polyester layer is essentially non oriented, in contrast with conventional polyester films. The polyester layer need not be directly bonded to the heat sealable layer by the bonding layer. One or more additional layers may be interposed between the bonding layer and the heat sealable layer. For example, scrap trimmed from the edge of the laminate may be returned to the extruder and mixed with the bonding layer or extruded as a separate layer between the bonding layer and the heatsealable layer. A further bonding layer may be located between the scrap layer and the heat sealable layer if the bond between them would otherwise be inadequate.
