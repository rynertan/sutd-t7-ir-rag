# Distributor apparatus for fluid including a gaseous and liquid phase.

## Abstract
An apparatus 20 for uniformly distributing a fluid including gaseous and liquid phases for use with a heat exchanger is disclosed. A liquid spreading device of the apparatus includes a main pipe 22 extending along the full length of a header of the apparatus, and a plurality of branch pipes 24 connected to the main pipe 22 and extending perpendicularly to the main pipe 22 just above and along the full width of downward flow inlets 5 of a core of the heat exchanger. Each branch pipe 24 has a plurality of liquid spreading holes 25 perforated in a predetermined spaced relationship at the bottom thereof. Thus, liquid can be distributed from the apparatus substantially uniformly within a deviation of, for example, plus or minus 10 percent.
