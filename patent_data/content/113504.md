# Method and apparatus for uniformly dispersing residual lubricant inside container bodies.

## Abstract
Containers produced by drawing processes, contain localised deposits of lubricant which interfere with subse quently applied coatings, so the deposits are spread uni formly over the container inside surfaces before coating. To spread the lubricant, a container 13 is revolved at high speed about its central axis and a close fitting cylindrical spreader brush or swab 12 is plunged into the container 13 and withdrawn. The container is then conveyed from the spreading station to a spraying station whereat an operative spray head 10a is plunged into the revolving container and withdrawn, to spray coat the container inside. The spreader 12 and spray head 10a move conjointly and hence two containers are acted upon during each plunging movement.

## Description
METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR UNIFORMLY DISPERSINGRESIDUAL LUBRICANT INSIDE CONTAINER BODIES This invention relates to method and apparatus for uniformly dispersing residual lubricant inside container bodies once the lubricant has been dispersed, inside coatings can successfully be applied. Containers may be made by a drawing operation which converts a flat disk of metal into a thin hollow cup having a height greater than its diameter.The metal may be tinplate, tin free steel, aluminium or black plate, with or without an organic precoating. Sometimes a postcoating is required to ensure complete coating continuity to protect the metal and the materials to be packed in the container from interacting. During the drawing operation, lubricants used in the process can collect on tool surfaces so that small lubricant residuals are left on the inside container surface and or accumulations of lubricant on the tool can drip into the drawn container. The resulting areas of high lubricant concentration can be visually unattractive after postcoating, and can prevent effective postcoating resulting in discontinuities such as eyeholing, postcoating dewetting, and the like. The quality of the postcoating can be measured by a quick test . In order to perform a quick test, a specified piece of equipment is required. More particularly, a Model 1071 WACOEnamel Rater with a 0 to 1 milliamp attachment is used. The apparatus has an electrode which is adapted to move vertically in and out along the axis of a container body positioned beneath it. The container is held in position by a vise like device which clamps about its bottom, the open top end of the container facing upwardly toward the electrode. Then, for example, in one method the container is filled with 2 solution of sodium sulfate and allowed to soak for at least 30 seconds before the electrode is dropped. The electrode is inserted until it is about 1 2.5 cm from the bottom of the container.The solution temperature should be maintained between 72 to 78 0F 22 to 25 0C and should so fill the container that when the electrode is lowered into the test position, the solution will reach approximately 1 8 3 mm below a top flange radius at the open end of the container. Care should be taken to avoid wetting the flange since that will result in a false high reading. The milliamp meter of the tester is connected to the vise like device and to the electrode. A zeroing of the instrument is required and the operator adjusts until the milliamp meter reads TJ on the scale. Shortly after zeroing the meter a warning light comes on and the reading should be taken immediately.When this procedure was applied to the containers post coated over the draw lubricant, readings, in the range of 0 to 3 milliamps are desired and are indicative of properly coated containers. Should a container fail the quick test, the postcoating will be ineffectively protective. Postcoating is required in certain circumstances, all of which relate to the desired shelf life of the packed and processed container.Certain comestibles are aggressive and attack the metal readily they therefore require postcoating to prevent degradation of the metal. Similarly, some metals do not precoat well and need a repair postcoating. Moreover, certain processes for drawing a container, such as those including ironing tend to scuff or injure the precoating and then postcoating is desirable for repair. Any combination of the foregoing factors will increase the need for a postcoating operation. Certain drawing lubricant combinations can be postcoated, but only if the residual lubricant is uniformly and thinly distributed within the completed, drawn container. When containers are completely drawn and trimmed such as, for example, in a press and process as described in U.S. A 4,262,510 and incorporated herein by reference, they are routinely run through a beading device such as a Redicon 12 spindle turret beader manufactured and sold by RediconCorporation, 4150 Beldon Village Street, N.W.,Canton, Ohio 44718. The beader rolls reinforcing convolutions into the side wall of the drawn container. Conveyors such as gravity tracks and elevators move the containers from the press to the beader and from the beader to postspraying equipment. In the preferred procedure, a lance sprayer is used to achieve proper inside coverage. Preferably 20 to 40 mg per 4 sq. in. 2 by the sprayer, depending on the coating material .Multiple station sprayer machines are preferred as they are readily adaptable to the present invention, which concerns a residual lubricant dispersing apparatus. One of these machines is used, and in particular a first station thereof receives the drawn container and has a residual lubricant spreading apparatus according to the invention mounted as would be a sprayer, for movement in and out of the rapidly rotating container. According to the present invention, there is provided an apparatus for uniformly dispersing residual lubricant remaining within a container having a hollow, thin wall cylindrical body with one open end, said apparatus being characterised by means for receiving and holding the container body while rotating it about the central axis thereof, a member adapted to move along the said axis in reciprocal fashion briefly to conjugate with the inside surfaces of the container body, and distribution means carried by the said member for contacting the inside surfaces of the body for uniformly spreading lubricant about the said inside surfaces. In the preferred procedure utilising this apparatus, the container rotates such that its surface speed is somewhere between 1,000 and 2,000 feet per minute 305 to 610 m min . In a matter of milliseconds, the said member penetrates the container and, carrying the distribution means, causes the residual lubricant to be spread thinly and uniformly about the inside surfaces of the container. The container in normal fashion is then moved to the next station of the lance sprayer wherein the postcoating is applied at the prescribed rate for the material used. The residual lubricant distribution means or spreader may be fashioned of a variety of materials or a combination thereof. For example, it may comprise a multibristle cylindrical brush, a nap like roller device, a swab or any combination of these or similar materials. The particular design or configuration of the distribution means is selected to reach all the internal surfaces and crevices of a beaded, thin hollow cylindrical walled drawn container to attain uniformity of spreading. The mounting of the apparatus at a first lance station of the sprayer machine assures the redistribution of lubricant immediately prior to the spraying operation. Also according to the present invention, there is provided a method of distributing residual lubricant resulting from the forming of a container body by drawing and redrawing, and in particular the lubricant remaining upon the inside surface of the body, characterised by the steps of positioning the body with an open end disposed on a predetermined axis, rotating the body about the said axis, and lancing a distributing member having a surface thereon for engaging the inside surfaces of the rotating body into and out of said body so as to spread the lubricant over the inside surfaces. The invention will now be described in more detail, by way of non limiting example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a schematic elevation view of equipment embodying the present invention, positioned ready for receiving two containers, Figure 2 shows the equipment of Figure 1 with the containers in position and being rotated in readiness for residual lubricant to be dispersed and a postcoat to be sprayed, Figure 3 shows the equipment entering two containers to disperse residual lubricant uniformly in one of them, the other container already having had the lubricant therein uniformly dispersed, Figure 4 shows the equipment at the end of its entering and dispersing stroke and just before it is retracted from the rotating containers, Figure 5 shows the equipment just after postcoat spraying of the said other container has started and as it commences its retraction stroke, Figure 6 shows the equipment in the course of the retraction and spraying stroke, and Figure 7 shows the equipment completely retracted from the containers so they can be shifted laterally to bring the said one container to a position for receiving a sprayed postcoat. The containers may be fashioned as explained herein by a drawing and ironing press wherein the sheet stock is converted into containers the depths of which are usually greater than the diameters.The containers are then conveyed to and passed through a rotary beader in which side wall corrugations are added, and are lined up for a postspraying machine.Such a machine, namely the CANCO Body SprayingMachine type RWS Serial No. 136 postspraying machine has been modified to perform two operations with each pass or cycle of the lancing apparatus of the sprayer. More specifically, the spraying apparatus holds two containers and rotates them at high speeds beneath a lubricant dispersing station and a spraying station which selectively operate with each lance or plung cycle of the apparatus into the containers.The motion of the spraying head 10 is controlled by a support 11 which also carries a cylindrical brush 12 rigidly mounted at 12a thereto. The brush 12 shown in the Figures is illustrative of one example of the practice of the invention. Successful use has been made of a nap like paint roller type dispersion device all similarly mounted as brush 12, a foam cyclindrical swab and adaptations of foam to rollers and brushes for purposes of enhanced treating of the inside bottom of a container 13.It has been found that any suitable spreading device which can be lanced into and out of the rotating container as shown in Figures 1 to 6 would effectively distribute residual lubricant left after drawing and redrawing, particularly where ironing is included as part of the container forming operation. Containers formed with ironed sidewalls tend to have an area of highly concentrated forming lubricant whether the lubricant was included in an organic precoating or whether it was applied separately to the material before or during the drawing and redrawing operation . That is to say that, forming with ironing generates a high level of stress and working upon the side walls of the container which in effect squeegees the excess oil to the point at which ironing terminates. More particularly, the side walls are generally ironed up to the flange or a slight distance therebelow and as a consequence lubricant may not be uniformly distributed about that area. Similarly, the higher levels of working stress on the side walls as opposed to the bottom tends to leave areas of high concentration of lubricant about the inside of the bottom.In normal operation the brush 12 will move with the lancetype sprayer 10 when the support 11 reciprocates into the rotating containers 13 as best shown inFigures 2 6. During the lancing movement of the brush 12 and the sprayer 10 into the container, a spraying head 10a begins to distribute postcoating into one container 13 which has already been treated by the brush 12 in the preceding adjacent station.More specifically, the container is first aligned with the brush 12 at the first operating station after which it is shifted to the second operating station. There, the container is sprayed by the spraying head lOa in the steps shown inFigures 5 and 6. In Figure 5, the brush 12 and the spraying head loa are at the bottom of their stoke where they have been moved to the support 11 and the spraying has started just prior to withdrawal of the brush 12 and the sprayer 10 as illustrated in Figure 6. Finally, Figure 7 shows schematically the brush 12 and the spray head lOa removed from the containers 13 thus permitting the containers 13 to be indexed, or shifted, to the right whereby the container 13 which has been sprayed can be discharged.The container which has been treated by the brush is then positioned ready for postspraying and a new container not shown is brought into alignment with the axis of the brush 12. Ordinarily lubricant levels of 20 to 30 mg sq foot per side 215 to 323 mg m are applied to the sheet material prior to drawing. For purposes of illustrating the effectiveness of the invention the starting sheet material was over lubricated to a level of 40 mg sq foot per side 430 mg m which is 50 above that which is ordinarily applied. Even with this most severe test the quick test results showed a successful redistribution of residual lubricant after drawing . The particular containers tested, and the results which follow, were made from 6546 DR9 tinplate with .0.25 A of tin per side per base box.The base box measure of the can makers art is the weight in pounds of 112 sheets of plate, each sheet measuring 14 inches by 20 inches 35.6 by 50.8 cm , and hence is the weight in pounds of 31360 in 20.2 21 1 lb or 1 per base box equals 0.0224 kg m2. Therefore, the said tinplate was 1.46 kg m2 and had 5.6 g m2 per side of tin. The lubricant includes lanolin and the container was a 211 X 314 diameter 2 and 11 16 inches and height 3 and 14 16 inches 68.3 x 98.4 mm . These containers were brushed with a cylindrical synthetic bristle brush having a diameter slightly greater than the can diameter They were then postcoated. The postcoating was a heat reactive phenolic modified epoxide carried in a primarily aliphatic solvent system. The quick test was run with 0.5 solution of potassium ferrocyanide in water as that electrolyte is appropriate for testing the effectiveness of the particular postcoating over drawn tinplate containers.The results are as follows. Quick test Reading No. of Cans of Cans in Milliamps Brushed Not Brushed Brushed Not Brushed 1 22 6 45.8 12.5 2 11 6 22.9 12.5 3 7 4 14.6 8.3 4 2 5 4.2 10.4 5 1 5 2.1 10.4 6 2 4 4.2 8.3 7 1 1 2.1 2.1 8 2 4 4.2 8.3 9 0 3 0.0 6.3 10 0 4 0.0 8.3OVER 10 0 6 0.0 12.5 48 48 100.00 100.00Since under 4 milliamps is ordinarily acceptable for commercial can manufacture a quick review of the table will show that over 83 of the cans brushed passed whereas only 33 passed when they were not brushed. If the lubricant level was in the 20 to 30 mg per sq foot per side range 215 to 323 mg m commercially used the percentage which passed would approach 100 . The 33 of unbrushed containers which passed were visually unacceptable because a dark brown discoloration appears wherever the excess residual lubricant remains. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that while the apparatus discussed in connection withFigures 1 to 7 is relatively straightforward and has been adapted of a CANCO Body Spraying Machine type RWS Serial No. 136 spray machine using relatively straightforward mounting techniques, other refinements and adaptations can be made to similar equipment without departing from the scope of the invention defined in the claims that follow.
