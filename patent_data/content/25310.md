# Pressurized rotary screening apparatus.

## Abstract
A rotary screening apparatus is provided for separating impurities in suspensions such as paper pulp or other slurries. The apparatus has a pressurized housing 10 with a cylindri cal screenplate 12 separating the housing into an outer annular accepts chamber 14 and an inner feed chamber 16 . An impeller 20 with one or more blades 22 is mounted inside the feed chamber and imparts a rotary motion to the slurry. A series of horizontal baffles 30, 34 attached to the impeller divide the feed chamber into at least three sections. Piping 46, 48 is provided to inject dilution liquid into at least the lower two sections at separately controllable rates to compensate for the dewatering which occurs in the inlet sec tion. The ability to treat and control individually each succes sive section of the screening device enables essentially com plete separation of desirable fibers from impurities.
