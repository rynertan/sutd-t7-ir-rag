# Method and apparatus for operating warp knitting machines.

## Abstract
A method for operating the guide bars 11 of warp knitting machines comprises feeding in to a computer 12 desired lapping instructions, the computer being program med to discriminate between permitted and prohibited lapping movements and being operative to prevent the attempted execution of prohibited movements. The compu ter 12 can be programmed to test instructions against a set of mandatory rules, which proscribe lapping movements that would crash the guide bars, and may also be program med to discriminate against ineffective lapping movements.
