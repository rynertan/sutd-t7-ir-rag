# Environmental control systems and methods and nozzles for use in such systems and methods.

## Abstract
An environmental control system which atomizes filtered and purified or pretreated water introduced at high pressures through a plurality of spaced nozzles 10 which have orifices having a diameter of about 10 microns to produce a mist of microscopic particles which evaporate at elevated tempe ratures by flash evaporation to produce a significant cooling effect. At normal temperatures cooling is minimal but humidification is obtained. The nozzles 10 which may be especially designed to eliminate or minimize clogging of the orifices are installed in elongated pipes or conduits 17 at selected intervals either in a single line or alternatively in a dual line of parallel pipes spaced one above or in front of the other with the nozzles arranged in a staggered manner so that emerging spray is from the upper pipe and is not ejected above the spray from the lower pipe. Additionally. the pipes are preferably positioned so that the ejection of spray from the nozzles 10 can occur at angles which will provide an optimum spray pattern. The preferred nozzle design utilizes an internal impeller which imparts rotary turbulence to the stream of water as it enters the orifice, which is itself positioned in an insert which extends forward of its housing to minimize formation of mineral deposits.
