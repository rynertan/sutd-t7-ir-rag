# Brush holding device for rotating electrical machines.

## Abstract
A brush holding device of an easy to assemble type disposed between a yoke 1 and an end frame 4 of a motor. The device has a brush holder 5 formed in one body from an electrically insulating material to include an annular type field winding fixing frame 1a , a brush holding stay having a plurality of brush chambers 5a thereon, each of the brush chambers having at least an opening 5k on the side of the end frame, integral connecting portions 5b annularly connecting the spaced brush chambers therebetween, an insulating plate 8 member having relatively rigid body portions 8a to cover the openings of the brush chambers and relatively flexible portions 8c connecting the body portions therebetween, and means for fixing the insulation to the brush holders by deforming the flexible portions of the insulator toward the brush holders. The aforementioned annular fixing frame 7 has a plurality of flanges radially outwardly extending from the outer periphery thereof by which the annular frame is circumferentially axially aligned with the yoke. Consequently, the brush holding device 5 is able to be rigidly held between the yoke 1 and the end frame 4 without using a bolt while establishing a good alignment of the device in the circumferential and the axial direction.
