# A process to eliminate lead in gasoline with a high octane number.

## Abstract
A process to eliminate lead in gasoline, at the same time maintaining a high octane number in the gasoline, by irradiating leaded gasoline, at room temperature and press ure, with U.V. rays, which generate free organo metallic radicals which facilitate a photochemical reaction with the gasoline, eliminating moloxides responsible for the reduc tion in the gasoline s octane number. In this manner an up graded gasoline is obtained, which is completely lead free, and prevents atmospheric pollution.
