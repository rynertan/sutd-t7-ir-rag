## Description
PROCESS FOR THE SELECTIVE REDUCTION OF A 14,17 DIOXO 8,14 SECO STEROID The invention relates to a process for the selective reduction of a 14,17 dioxo 8,14 seco1,3,5 10 ,9 11 oestratetraene to the corresponding 14,17 ketol with the aid of a chiral reducing agent. The reduction of such a diketone to thecorres ponding ketol forms an important intermediate step in the total synthesis of 19 nor steroids by Torgov s method. In the original Torgov synthesis of 19 norsteroids Tetrahedron Letters 1963 , 1553 3methoxy 8,14 seco 1,3,5 10 ,9 11 oestratetraene 14,17 dione is condensed under the influence of an acid to 3 methoxy 1,3,5 10 ,8,14 oestrapentaen 17 one. During this step a chiral centre forms which gives rise to the formation of a racemate. By resolution it is possible to isolate from the racemate the steroid with natural configuration. The unnatural steroid the enantiomer , for which as yet no practical application has been found, has to be discarded. Many attempts have been made to arrive at a stereoselective modification of the Torgov synthesis.Detailed investigations have been made into selective reduction of the 14,17 dione to the corresponding ketol followed by ring closure of the 8,14 secocompound. Details are given in J.Org.Chem. 33, 3126 1968 of the reduction of 3 methoxy 8,14 seco 1,3,5 10 ,9 11 oestratetraene 14,17 dione by means of Li O t butyl 3AlH to the corresponding ketol. The racemic trans ketol turns out to be the main product 85 90 , and the racemic cis ketol is the by product. Thus the reduction exhibits a high diastereoselectivity. In this specification ketol signifies the oxoalcohol obtained by partial reduction of the 14,17 dione. Cis and trans denote the position of the hydroxyl group with respect to the alkyl group at position 13 in the 8,14 seco steroid. From the racemic trans ketol obtained by partial reduction as described above it is possible to obtain the trans ketol with natural configuration by resolution via the hemisuccinate and the quinine salt thereof. The undesirable isomers can be converted back into the initial dione by oxidation. Cyclisation of the acetylated trans ketol with natural configuration gives the natural 3 methoxy 1,3,5 10 ,8,14 oestra pentaen i7a ol 17 acetate. A similar route, but using NaBH4 as reducing agent, is described in Chem.Pharm Bulletin, 21, 107 1973 , in which at the same time it is pointed out that reduction of the 13 ethyl analogue the 18 methylhomologue also supplies mainly the trans ketol. A further development in the stereoselective reduction of 3 methoxy 8,14 seco 1,3,5 10 ,9 11 oestra tetraene 14,17 dione is described in Chem.Ber. 108, 2665 1975 , viz. the reduction with chiral reducing agents. Lithium aluminiumhydride complexes with chiral alcohols, optionally combined with achiral alcohols, were employed as chiral reducing agents.The following chiral alcohols were used butane 2,3 diol, butane 2,3 diol, 1,4 bis dimethylamino 2S,3S butane 2,3 diol, pseudo ephedrine, ephedrine. Benzyl alcohol, isopropanol, t. butyl alcohol and the methyl ether of glycol were used as achiral alcohols. Although, with the different complexes, a reasonable diastereoselectivity trans cis ratio 7 3 was obtained, the enantioselectivity appeared to leave a great deal to be desired. The best results were obtained with a complex of LiAlH4, ephedrine and benzylalcohol. An optically active mixture of the trans ketol and the cis ketol was obtained with a ratio 7 3 using this complex, whilst for the trans ketol the enantiomeric ratio was 61.5 38.5. In this case apart from the relatively simple cis trans separation, a difficult separation of enantiomers is furthermore always required in order to obtain optically pure compounds. It should also be pointed out that for cyclisation a cis ketol is more suitable than a trans ketol. A cis ketol can be cyclised directly with acid to the corresponding 1,3,5 10 ,8,14 gonapentaene. In the presence of acid a trans ketol will initially give rise to the formation of a 9,14 spiro ether which subsequently can be cyclised under somewhat more rigorous conditions to the desired 1,3,5 10 ,8,14 gonapentaene. In order to prevent the spiro ether formation a trans ketol is best initially acetylated, after which the acetylated trans ketol is cyclised with acid to the corresponding 17 acetoxy 1,3,5 10 ,8,14 gonapentaene. Hydrolysis of the 17 acetoxy group supplies the free alcohol. It has been surprisingly established that using a chiral reducing agent consisting of a complex of an alkali metal aluminium hydride with a special chiral alcohol, optionally combined with an achiral alcohol or phenol, 8,14 seco 1,3,5 10 ,9 11 oestratetraene 14,17 diones can be reduced to the corresponding 14,17 ketols with an enantioselectivity enantiomeric ratio which is so much more favourable than that obtainable hitherto that it is possible to isolate optically pure or almost optically pure ketols from the reaction mixture without having to resolve racemates or other enantiomeric mixtures, whilst in addition a high, i.e. favourable diastereoselectivity trans cis or cis trans ratio is obtained. To clarify the concepts diastereoselectivity and enantioselectivity reference is made to Angew. Chemie Int.Ed. 10 12 , 871 1971 . Thus the invention relates to a process for the selective reduction of an 8,14 seco 1,3,5 10 ,9 11 oestratetraene 14,17 dione to the corresponding 14,17 ketol with the aid of a chiral reducing agent and is characterised in that such a 14,17 dione is reduced by means of a complex alkali metal aluminiumhydride having the formula M Al OR1 m OR2 n H4 m n, in which M represents an alkali metal OR1 is derived from the chiral alcohol 2S,3R 4 dimethylamino 3 methyl 1,2 diphenyl 2 butanol or the enantiomer thereof with the 2R,3S configurationOR2 is derived from an achiral organic hydroxy compound having 1 10 C atoms m 1 3 n 0 2 and m n 4 3. M can for example be lithium, sodium or potassium and is preferably lithium. The chiral reducing agent based on the chiral alcohol in the 2S,3R form is as such known from J.Org.Chem. 38, 1870 1973 . In the asymmetric reduction described therein of achiral ketones to chiral alcohols, admittedly a certain level of enantioselectivity is achieved, but optically pure or almost optically pure alcohols are not obtained. The achiral organic hydroxy compound optionally employed in the complex can be an alcohol such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, butanol, isobutanol, tert. butanol, benzylalcohol, glycol monomethylether and the like, or a phenol substituted or unsubstituted by alkyl groups such as phenol, 3,5 dimethyl phenol, and the like. Since the use of groups OR2 in the complex offers no advantages, as compared with complexes without OR2 groups, and sometimes even gives poorer results as regards asymmetric induction and or yield, n is preferably 0. In the formula M Al 0R1 m 0R2 n H4mn1 m and n relate to the number of mol equivalents of the groupsOR1 and OR2 per mol complex, i.e. m and n do not need to definitely be whole numbers, but can have each value within the specified limits. Preferably m is 2 3, but especially 2 2.5. The complex is obtained by allowing lithium aluminium hydride to react in a solvent, normally diethylether, at a temperature of 0 30 OC whilst being stirred with the chiral alcohol and optionally the achiral hydroxy compound in the desired molar ratio. The process in accordance with the invention is applied preferably to 14,17 dioxo 8,14 seco steroids having the formula EMI6.1 in whichR3 CH3 or C2H5R4 H, alkyl, OH or alkoxy andR5 H, alkyl, OH or alkoxy. Concerning the substituents R4 and R5 the following can be stated Preferably one of the substituents R4 and R5 isOH or alkoxy, such as methoxy, and is then located at the 3 position. The other substituent is then for example H, methyl or methoxy and is then located at the l position, the 2 position or the 4 position.Preferably R4 is H and R5 is 3 methoxy, because such initial products via the reduction in accordance with the invention, the cyclisation of the ketol thus obtained and a number of reduction steps lead to oestradiol R3 CH3 and important 19 nor steroids. Reduction of the diketones mentioned above leads in principle to a mixture of 4 stereoisomeric ketols 2 racemates with partial structure EMI6.2 13R,17R 13R,17S 13S,17R 13S,17S These 4 ketols possess the configuration specified underneath the respective partial structures. The application of the chiral reducing agent in accordance with the invention leads surprisingly exclusively, or almost exclusively, to a mixture of two stereoisomeric ketols which are not mirror images of each other, but are a trans ketol and a cis ketol. Dependent on the application in the chiral reducing agent of the 2S,3R amino alcohol, or the 2R,3S aminoalcohol, the reduction gives either a optically active mixture of the trans and the cis ketol both with the 17R configuration or a optically active mixture of the trans and the cis ketol both with the 17Sconfiguration. When R3 CH3, then the use of the 2S,3R amino alcohol in the chiral reducing agent gives mainly the trans ketol with 13R,17R configuration with as by product also the cis ketol with 13S,17R configuration. In this case the trans cis ratio is 7 to 8 3 to 2. The mixture thus obtained of trans and cis ketol can be separated in the usual way, e.g. by fractional crystallisation or by means of chromatography. The 13 methyl 17R trans ketol can subsequently be cyclised in the known manner, preferably after acetylation, to give the corresponding 13 methyl 1,3,5 10 ,8,14 gonapentaene with natural configuration.The 13 methyl 17R cis ketol can, possibly after acetylation, be cyclised in a similar manner to give the enantiosteroid or be reconverted by oxidation into the 14,17 dione, which can then be employed once more for reduction. Having regard to the hitherto low demand for ent steroids, preference will be given to conversion into the 14,17 dione. When using the enantiomeric amino alcohol in the chiral reducing agent, the enantiomeric ketols are obtained in the same trans cis ratio, i.e. the 135,17S trans ketol and the 13R,17S cis ketol. When R3 C2H5, then remarkably during reduction in accordance with the invention the diastereoselectivity appears to be completely reversed whilst maintaining the 100 or almost 100 enantioselectivity.When using the 2S,3R amino alcohol in the chiral reduction agent, in this case it is precisely essentially the cis ketol with 13S,17R configuration which is obtained with also as by product, the transketol with 13R,17R configuration. In this case the cis trans ratio is 7 to 8 3 to 2. Cyclization of the main product the 13 ethyl 17R cis ketol leads to the corresponding 13 ethyl 1,3,5 10 ,8,14 gonapentaene with unnatural configuration.The by product gives a steroid with natural configuration.By now employing the 2R,3S amino alcohol in the chiral reducing agent, for R3 C2H5, during the reduction of the 14,17 dione mainly the cis ketol with 13R,17S configuration is obtained and the trans ketol with 13S,17S configuration, and now once more with a cis trans ratio of 7 to 8 3 to 2. Cyclization of the 13 ethyl 17S cis ketol supplies the corresponding 13 ethyl 1,3,5 10 ,8,14 gona pentaene with natural configuration. The by product the trans ketol can, preferably before cyclization of the cis ketol, be isolated in the normal way and, by oxidation, be converted back into the diketone, which can be employed once again in the reduction step.Naturally the 17S trans ketol can also be cyclized after acetylation to give a 13 ethyl gonapentaene with unnatural configuration if there is a need for this. A surprising advantage of the 13 ethyl series is that the 13 ethyl 1,3,5 10 ,8,14 gonapentaene 170 ol or its 17 acetate is obtained as main product from the 13 ethyl 17S cis ketol. As has already been pointed out, a cis ketol is more suitable for cyclization than is a trans ketol. A further advantage is also that the natural gonapentaene obtained with the 13 ethyl group and the 17 hydroxy group in the cis position 13ss ethyl 17ss OH during the following reduction of the A14 double bond catalytic reduction with Pd on CaC03 gives a higher yield of desirable 14a compound than would be the case with the transcompound 13B ethyl 17a OH . The process in accordance with the invention is characterised by its versatility. Both in the 13 methyl and the 13 ethyl series it is possible, at will, to obtain the natural or the unnatural steroid as main product by employing the chiral reducing agent based on the 2S,3R amino alcohol or the 2R,3S amino alcohol or conversely. The main product can, without a great deal of difficulty, be separated from the by product. Resolution of a racemate or other mixture of enantiomers is not necessary. By products are not lost, but can be converted once more into initial starting products. The chiral alcohol used in the chiral reducing agent is similarly not lost, but can be recovered from the mother liquor by the addition of acid without racemization and can hence be employed once more. From the above it is clear that the invention can also be characterised as a method for manufacturing optically pure 14,17 ketols from 8,14 seco 1,3,5 10 , 9 11 oestratetraenes without the need for racemate or enantiomeric mixture resolution, by reducing the corresponding 14,17 dione with the above mentioned chiral reducing agent. The following statements can also be made with regard to the reaction conditions of the reduction stage As medium for the reduction a suitable solvent is selected, usually ether diethyl ether , but the reaction can also be undertaken in tetrahydrofuran, toluene or in alkanes such as pentane or hexane. Reduction is undertaken at low temperatures, normally between 50 OC and 100 OC and preferably at a temperature between 60 OC and 80 OC. The amount of reducing agent with respect to the amount of dione is at least equimolar and is normally, for practical reasons, not more than 5 mol per mol dione. Preferably a quantity of 2 mol reducing agent per mol dione is employed. Of the initial 14,17 diones, the 3 methoxy 8,14 seco 1,3,5 10 ,9 11 oestratetraene 14,17 dione and the 13 ethyl analogue are described in the literature.14,17 Diones with a substitution in ring A differing therefrom can be produced in accordance with a known method using the Torgov synthesis by reaction of a 2 R3 cyclopentane l,3 dione R3 CH3 or C2H5 with a l vinyl l tetralol with the desired R4,R5 substitution in the pro A ring, e.g. 6 methoxy 8 methyl 1 vinyl 1,2,3 ,4 tetrahydro l naphthol or 5, 6 dimethoxy l vinyl 1,2,3,4 tetrahydro l naphthol. The optically pure 1,3,5 10 ,8,14 gonapentaenes obtained by cyclization of the optically pure ketols can be converted in the conventional manner into important known steroids. First of all the A14 double bond is reduced, catalytically, with Pd on CaC03 as catalyst, whereby the desired 14a steroid is obtained almost exclusively.The subsequent reduction of the A8 double bond with lithium in NH3 leads to oestradiol or derivatives thereof. A Birch reduction of the aromatic A ring then gives access to 3 keto A4 oestrenes or 3 keto 10 oestrenes. The introduction of an ethynyl group at position 17 then gives known progestagens such as norethisteron and norethynodrel. In this way, in the 13 ethyl series, we arrive at the known d norgestrel. The invention will now be illustrated with the aid of the following examples without these restricting its scope. Example I A solution of 34.0 g 120 mmol of 2S,3R 4 dimethylamino 3 methyl l, 2 diphenyl 2 butanol in 90 ml dry ether was added dropwise to a stirred suspension of 1.96 g 52 mmol LiAlH4 in 870 ml of dry ether at 0 C under nitrogen. The mixture obtained was stirred for 5 minutes at O 0C and then cooled down to 75 OC A solution of 7.16 g 24 mmol 3 methoxy 8,14 seco 1,3,5 10 ,9 11 oestratetraene 14,17 dione in 150 ml of dry ether was added dropwise at such a rate that the temperature did not rise above 70 C. The mixture obtained was then stirred for 30 minutes at 75 C, after which about 40 ml of water was added carefully dropwise.After heating up to O OC it was acidified with cold 2 N HC1, water was added and the mixture was extracted with ether. The ether extract was washed until neutral with water and dried on anhydrousMgS04. The combined water layers were rendered alkaline with 3 N KOH, by means of which the precipitated amino alcohol could be recovered quantitatively and without racemization. Concentration of the ether extract under reduced pressure gave a residue on drying of 7.05 g, in accordance with the H NMR spectrum about 4 1 trans cis ketol, each consisting of more than 95 of one enantiomer determined by means of a chiral H NMR shift reagent . By crystallisation from diisopropyl ether 4.45 g was obtained of the trans ketol 17 hydroxy 3 methoxy 8,14 seco l,3, 5 10 ,9 l1 oestratetraen 14 one with a melting point of 100 102 OC and Ca120 460 Cc 1, dioxane .The mother liquor was filtered in 1,000 ml methylene chloride acetone mixture 98 2 over a column of 100 g silicagel and then recrystallised out of methylene chloride diisopropyl ether. 1.01 g Of the cis ketol 14ss hydroxy 3 methoxy 8,14 seco 1,3,5 10 ,9 11 oestratetraen 17 one was obtained with a melting point of 110 112 OC and ta 20 370 Cc 1, dioxane . The ketol obtained initially 4.45 g was dissolved in 40 ml of dry pyridine and under nitrogen at room temperature 8 ml of acetic anhydride was added.The mixture was stirred for 16 hours at room temperature and was subsequently poured into a mixture of ice and water. After 3 hours stirring extraction with ether was carried out. The ether extract was washed consecutively with cold 2 N HC1, water and with NaHC03 solution. After drying on anhydrous MgS04 and evaporation of the solvent, this gave the 17a acetoxy 3 methOxy 8,14 seco 1,3,5 10 ,9 11 oestratetraen 14 one 5.00 g . Without further purification this compound was dissolved in 200 ml benzene, 320 mg p toluene sulphonic acid was added and the mixture was boiled for 30 minutes using an azeotropic water separator. After cooling down the mixture was washed with NaHC03solution and subsequently dried on anhydrous Mugs04. The solvent was evaporated and the residue was recrystallised out of ethanol, which gave 4.01 g of 3 methoxy 1,3,5 10 ,8,14 oestrapentaen 17 ol 17 acetate with melting point 127 128 OC and a 20 1830 c 1, CHcl3 . Analogous with the ketol initially obtained, the second ketol which had been isolated was also acetylated and then cyclised by treating it with p toluene sulphonic acid. Recrystallization of the resultant product from ethanol gave 0.71 g ent 3 methoxy 1,3,5 10 ,8,14 oestrapentaen 17ss ol 17 acetate with melting point 87 89 OC and a 20 1800 c 1, CHCl3 . Example II The crude mixture of trans and cis ketol 7.05 g, about 4 1 trans cis obtained in accordance with the procedure in example I was acetylated and then cyclized with p toluene sulphonic acid as described in example I for the separate ketols. The mixture thus obtained was separated via column chromatography over 200 g silicagel using hexane ethyl acetate 98 2. Recrystallisation of the products obtained from ethanol gave 4.08 g 3 methoxy 1,3,5 10 , 8,14 oestrapentaene 17a ol 17 acetate with melting point 127 128 OC and a 20 1830 c 1, CHC13 as main product. In addition 0.75 g of ent 3 methoxy 1,3,5 10 ,8,14 oestrapentaen 17B ol 17 acetate was obtained with melting point of 87 89 OC and al20 1800 c 1, CHCl3 . Example III The procedures in example I and example II were repeated, the only difference being that 2S,3R 4 dimethylamino 3 methyl 1,2 diphenyl 2 butanol was replaced by an equal weight of its enantiomer 2R,3S 4 dimethylamino 3 methyl 1,2 diphenyl 2 butanol. In this way the enantiomers of the products specified in examples I and II were obtained, these being 14 alpha hydroxy 3 methoxy 8,14 seco 1,3,5 10 ,9 11 oestratetraen 17 one 4.45 g with melting point 100 102 C and alpha D20 46 c 1, dioxane 17ss hydroxy 3 methoxy 8,14 seco 1,3,5 10 ,9 11 oestratetraen 14 one 1.0 g with melting point of 110 112 OC and alpha D20 37 c 1, dioxane ent 3 methoxy 1,3,5 10 ,8,14 oestrapentaen 17a 17 acetate 4.0 g with melting point of 127 128 C and a 20 1830 c 1, CHC13 3 methoxy 1,3,5 10 ,8,14 oestrapentaen 17ss ol 17 acetate 0.7 g with melting point of 87 89 C and alpha D20 180 c 1, CHCl3 . Example IV a 19.7 ml 29.7 g 0.28 mol of vinyl bromide dissolved in 70 ml of dry tetrahydrofuran was added dropwise to a mixture of 6.0 g 0.25 mol magnesium, 7.5 ml dry tetrahydrofuran and a small crystal of iodine at such a rate that the mixture boiled gently.Subsequently stirring was carried out for a further 30 minutes at room temperature, after which a solution of 11.8 g 62 mmol 6 methoxy 8 methyl 1,2,3,4 tetrahydronaphthalen l one in 22.5 ml of dry tetrahydrofuran and 90 ml of dry ether was added dropwise, the temperature of the reaction mixture being maintained at 20 C. The mixture was stirred for 2 further hours at room temperature after which, subject to ice cooling, a solution of 16.6 g NH4C1 in 33 ml of water was added dropwise. The mixture obtained was diluted wuth water and extracted with ether. The ether extract was washed with saturated NaCl solution and dried on an hydros Na2 SO4. Evaporation of the solvent supplied the crude vinyl carbinol 15.8 g which was employed without purification.It was placed in 50 ml dry ether and added dropwise to a suspension of 4.9 g 64 mmol thioureum in 50 ml glacial acetic acid which was maintained at 20 C. The mixture was stirred for a further 16 hours at room temperature and then concentrated as far as possible under vacuum. The residue was boiled up for some minutes with 150 ml of dry ether, after which the crystalline deposit was drawn off and dried. The yield was 12.8 g 6 methoxy 8 methyl 1,2,3,4 tetrahydronaphthylidene ethyl isothiouronium acetate with a melting point of 147 151 OC. b A mixture of 10.0 g 30 mmol of the isothiouronium salt obtained, 10.0 g 86 mmol of 2 methyl 1,3 cyclopentanedione, 150 ml methanol and 150 ml water was boiled for 45 minutes under nitrogen. After cooling down to room temperature the greater part of the methanol was removed under reduced pressure. Then extraction was carried out with ethyl acetate. The extract was washed with saturated NaHC03 and with saturated NaCl solution and dried on anhydrous Mug 504. Evaporation gave a yellow oil which was chromatographed over 200 g silicagel with hexane ethyl acetate mixture 7 3 as elution agent. This gave 7.4 g of 3 methoxy l methyl 8,14 seco 1,3,5 10 , 9 11 oestratetraen 14,17 dione as a colourless oil.c At 0 C under nitrogen a solution of 39.2 g 138 mmol 2R,3S 4 dimethylamino 3 methyl 1,2 diphenyl 2 butanol in 100 ml of dry ether was added dropwise to a stirred solution of 2.30 g 61 mmol LiA1H4 in 1000 ml of dry ether. The resultant mixture was stirred for a further 5 minutes at O OC and then cooled down to 75 OC. A solution of the 3 methoxy l methyl 8,14 seco 1,3,5 10 ,9 11 oestratetraen 14,17 dione 7.40 g, 24 mmol obtained in b in 170 ml dry ether was added dropwise at such a rate that the temperature did not rise above 70 OC. After stirring had been continued for 30 minutes at 75 OC, the mixture was worked up as described in example I.This gave a yellow oil 7.23 g with a 20 330 c 1, CHC13 according to the H NMR analysis roughly a 4 1 mixture of trans and cis ketol, each consisting of more than 90 of one enantiomer.This mixture was acetylated and subsequently cyclized with p toluene sulphonic acid as described in exampleII. The resultant mixture was separated via column chromatography 200 g silicagel elution agent hexaneethyl acetate 98 2 and the products were recrystallized out of methanol. This gave 4O g ent 3 methoxy 1 methyl 1,3,5 10 ,8,14 oestrapentaen 17a ol 17 acetate with a melting point 147 153 OC and a 20 4,70 c 1, CHC13 plus 1.1 g 3 methoxy l methyl l,3,5 10 ,8,14 oestra pentaen 17ss ol 17 acetate with melting point 94 95 C and orl20 270 c 1, CHCl3 . Example V In the same manner as described in example IV, 5,6 dimethoxy 1,2,3,4 tetrahydronaphthalen 1 one was converted via the 5,6 dimethoxy 1,2,3,4 tetrahydro naphthylidene ethyl isothiouronium acetate into 3,4 dimethoxy 8,14 seco 1,3 10 ,9 11 oestratetraene 14,17 dione. Then this dione 8.20 g, 25 mmol was reduced as described in example I with the reagent formed from 2.10 g 55 mmol LiAlH4 and 35.75 g 125 mmol 2R,35 4 dimethylamino 3 methyl 1,2 diphenyl 2 butanol. After treatment as described in example I the reaction product was recrystallised out of methylene chloride diisopropylether, this giving 4.83 g 14 alpha hydroxy 3,4 dimethoxy 8,14 seco 1,3,5 10 ,9 11 oestratetraene 17 one with a melting point of 117 119 C, a120 690 c 0.87 CHCl3 and 98 of one enantiomer in accordance with H NMR analysis. Chromatography of the mother liquor over silicagel with methylene chloride acetone 98 2 as elution agent, followed by crystallisation out of methylene chloridediisopropyl ether gave 1.30 g of 17ss hydroxy 3,4 dimethOxy 8,14 seco 1,3,5 10 ,9 11 oestratetraen 14 one with melting point 88 91 OC, a 20 560 c 1.18, CHC13 and 98 of one enantiomer in accordance withH NMR analysis. Both ketols were acetylated and subsequently cyclized with p toluene sulphonic acid as described in example I.Recrystallisation of the two reaction products gave respectively 4.74 g ent 3,4 dimethoxy 1,3,5 10 ,8,14 oestrapentaen 17 alpha ol 17 acetate with melting point 188 189 OC, a 20 1620 1 DCc 0.93, CHC13 , 98 an enantiomer H NMR analysis and 1.15 g 3,4 dimethoxy 1,3,5 10 ,8,14 oestrapentaene 17p ol 17 acetate with a 2 1570 c 0.9, CHCl3 , 98 of one enantiomer H NMRanalysis . Example VI a 7.50 g 24 mmol 13 ethyl 3 methoxy 8,14 seco 1,3,5 10 ,9 11 gonatetraene 14,17 dione was reduced as described in example I with the reagent formed from 1.96 g 52 mmol LiAlH4 and 34.0 g 120 mmol 2R,3S 4 dimethylamino 3 methyl 1,2 diphenyl 2 butanol and then treated as indicated in example I.The product obtained was, according to the H NMR analysis, a mixture of cis and trans ketol in a ratio of roughly 4 1, whereby each ketol consisted of more than 95 of one enantiomer. Recrystallisation of this product from diisopropyl ether gave 4.50 g of the cis.ketol 13 ethyl 17B hydroxy 3 methoxy 8,14 seco 1,3,5 10 ,9 11 gonatetraen 14 one with melting point 86 88 OC and 120 130 Cc 1, dioxane .b The ketol obtained in a was acetylated and then cyclized with p toluene sulphonic acid as described in example I. The product was recrystallised out of methanol, which gave 4.2 g 13 ethyl 3 methoxy 1,3,5 10 ,8,14 gonapentaen 17B ol 17 acetate with melting point 77 78 OC and a 20 1990 c 1, CHCl3 . c The mother liquor which remained after crystallisation of the cis ketol in a , 3.0 g was mixed in 15 ml dry dimethylsulphoxide, after which 15 ml of benzene, 0.8 ml pyridine and 0.4 ml trifluoroacetic acid were added. Subsequently 6.2 g dicyclohexylcarbodiimide was added and the mixture was stirred for 16 hours at room temperature. 250 ml ether was added, followed by a solution of 2.70 g oxalic acid in 25 ml methanol. After gas evolution had ceased 250 ml water was added and the mixture was filtered. The organic phase was washed with NaHC03 solution and with water, dried on anhydrous Na2S04, filtered over 30 g silicagel and evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure. The residue on drying 2.90 g consisted of practically pure 13 ethyl 3 methOxy 8,14 seco 1,3,5 10 ,9 11 gonatetraene 14,17 dione, suitable for recirculation to the reduction process. Example VII At O OC under nitrogen 2.9 ml 50 mmol of absolute ethanol was added dropwise slowly to a stirred suspension of 1.90 g 50 mmol LiAlH4 in 850 ml of dry ether, after 15 minutes subsequent stirring followed by a solution of 28.3 g 100 mmol C 2S,3R 4 dimethylamino 3 methyl l,2 diphenyl 2 butanol in 70 ml of dry ether. After stirring for 5 minutes at O OC this reagent was then used to reduce, at 70 OC, 7.16 g 24 mmol of 3 methoxy 8,14 seco 1,3,5 10 ,9 11 oestratetraene 14,17 dione as described in example I.The mixture, treated in an analogous manner, consisting according to the H NMR analysis of a mixture of trans and cis ketol in a ratio of about 7 3 whereby each ketol consisted of more than 95 of one enantiomer. 4.25 g 17a hydroxy 3 methoxy 8,14 seco 1,3,5 10 , 9 11 oestratetraen 14 one with a melting point of 100 102 OC and 20 46 c 1, dioxane plus 1.10 g 140 hydroxy 3 methoxy 8,14 seco 1,3,5 10 ,9 11 oestratetraen 17 one with melting point 110 112 OC and 20 37 c 1, dioxane were isolated from this in the manner described in example I. Example VIII A solution of 34.0 g 120 mmol 2S,3R 4 dimethylamino 3 methyl l, 2 diphenyl 2 butanol in 200 ml dry toluene was added dropwise at 20 OC under nitrogen to a stirred suspension of 2.27 g 60 mmol LiAlH4 in 600 ml of dry toluene. The mixture was stirred for 15 minutes at 20 C and then cooled down to 60 OC. At this temperature a solution of 5.96 g 20 mmol 3 methoxy 8,14 seco 1,3,5 10 ,9 11 oestratetraene 14,17 dione in 150 ml of dry toluene was added dropwise.The mixture obtained was stirred for a further 30 minutes at 50 C after which about 40 ml of water was carefully added dropwise. After treatment as specified in example I similar results were obtained. Example IX In the same manner as described in example IV 6,7 dimethoxy 1,2,3,4 tetrahydronaphthalen 1 one was converted via 6,7 dimethoxy 1,2,3,4 tetrahydro naphthylidene ethyl isothiouronium acetate into 2,3 dimethoxy 8,14 seco 1,3,5 10 ,9 11 oestra tetraene 14,17 dione, this dione was reduced with the chiral reducing agent based on the aminoalcohol to the trans ketol l7a hydroxy 2,3 dimethoxy 8,14 seco 1,3,5 10 ,9 11 oestratetraen 14 one and the cis ketol 14B hydroxy 2,3 dimethoxy 8,14 seco 1,3,5 10 ,9 11 oestratetraen 17 one trans cis 4 1 and the ketols were cyclized to give respectively 2,3 dimethoxy 1,3,5 10 ,8,14 oestrapentane 17 ol 17 acetate and ent 2,3 dimethoxy 1,3,5 10 ,8,14oestrapentaene 17B ol 17 acetate.
