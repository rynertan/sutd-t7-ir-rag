## Description
Process for the preparation of tricyclic compounds, intermediates useful in said process, novel tricyclic compounds so prepared and the use thereof as odoriferous agents. The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of tricyclic compounds, as well as to intermediate compounds useful in this process. The tricyclic compounds so prepared are useful as odoriferous agents. As will be particularly specified hereinafter in a more detailed manner, some of these tricyclic compounds are novel. These novel compounds constitute a particular aspect of the invention by virtue of their interesting olfactory properties. The key reaction of the synthesis of the present invention is a cyclisation reaction. Thus, the invention relates to a process for the preparation of tricyclic compounds, characterised in that a compound of the general formulaEMI1.1 in which R represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group containing from 1 to 5 carbon atoms, the dotted line represents an optional carbon carbon bond, and OR represents a leaving group, is cyclised by reaction with an alkali metal in an organic solvent to give a compound of the general formula EMI2.1 wherein R and the dotted line have the meanings given above, and, if desired, the said compound of formula I is hydrogenated to yield a tricyclic compound of the general formulaEMI2.2 wherein R has the meaning given above. The radical R may be any group which, together with the adjacent oxygen atom, forms an appropriate leaving group under the conditions of the cyclisation reaction.Examples of R include alkyl, alkoxyalkyl, pyranyl, tetrahydropyranyl and trialkylsilyl, wherein the alkyl and alkoxy groups contain from 1 to 5 carbon atoms. The alkyl group is preferably methyl or ethyl and the alkoxy group preferably methoxy or ethoxy.R preferably represents a methoxymethyl, methyl, tetrahydropyranyl or trimethylsilyl group. The cyclisation may be effected in any convenient organic solvent. The solvent used is normally a polar aprotic organic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran or dimethoxyethane. The cyclisation reaction may conveniently be carried out at a temperature of up to the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture, preferably at a temperature of from 60 to 100 C. The reaction can be effected at the ambient pressure and in the presence of any alkali metal, preferably lithium, sodium or potassium. The novel tricyclic compounds according to the present invention have the general formulaEMI3.1 in which R represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group containing from 1 to 5 carbon atoms and the dotted line represents an optional carbon carbon bond, with the proviso that where said optional carbon carbon bond is absent, R is different from hydrogen. The group R can be any straight or branched chain alkyl group having from 1 to 5 carbon atoms such as, for example, methyl, ethyl, n propyl, isopropyl, n butyl, isobutyl, t butyl or n pentyl. R preferably represents methyl. Specific compounds of formula I which constitute preferred embodiments of the invention are compounds of the formulae EMI3.2 The starting material of general formula V above, used in the process according to the present invention, may be prepared in any convenient manner. One such procedure, starting from 2,2,6 trimethyl cyclohexadien2,4 one which leads to compounds of general formula V, is set out below EMI4.1 2,2,6 Trimethyl cyclohexadien 3,5 one of general formula VII may be converted into the ring unsaturated diketone of general formula VIII by reaction with a compound of general formulaEMI5.1 wherein R has the meaning given above, namely hydro gen or an alkyl group having from 1 to 5 carbon atoms. The dienone of general formula VII is conveniently used in the form of its dimer, since this results in a better yield. The dimer disassociates and yields the monomer in situ on refluxing in xylene. When acrolein is used as the compound of general formula IX R H , it should be added gradually in order to avoid polymerisation. The diketone of formula VIII is then epimerised and, if desired, also hydrogenated depending on which substance of general formula V is desired. When not only the epimerisation but also the hydrogenation is carried out, the yield may vary depending on the order in which the two reactions are effected. Thus, where it is desired to produce compounds of general formula V, in which the dotted line is absent, the hydrogenation is preferably effected prior to the epimerisation. When the carbon carbon bond represented by the dotted line is present, there will clearly not be any hydrogenation stage. The hydrogenation reaction involving the conversion of compounds of formulae VIII and XI into compounds of formulaeX and XII, respectively, can be carried out by any convenient method, for example by means of hydrogen in the presence of palladium on carbon. This hydrogenation may conveniently be carried out under pressure, at the ambient temperature and conveniently in an inert organic solvent, preferably a hydrocarbon solvent such as pentane. The epimerisation reaction, in which the compounds of formula VIII and X are epimerised to the compounds of formulae XI and XII, respectively, can be carried out by any convenient method. The preferred method used will vary according to whether R represents hydrogen or an alkyl group, that is to say whether an aldehyde or a ketone side chain is being epimerised. In the case of a ketone, the reaction will be effected advantageously by means of sodium methyl ate in methanol as solvent. The reaction can be effected at any appropriate temperature, that is to say between room temperature and the reflux temperature of the solvent. Where an aldehyde is used as the starting material, the epimerisation may be effected by means of piperidinium acetate at the reflux temperature of the solvent. The compounds of formulae XI and XII may be converted via the corresponding alcohol of formula XIII to the starting material for the process of the invention, namely the compounds of formula V. The alcohols of formulaXIII may be prepared by the action of a vinyl organometallic compound on a compound of formula XI or of formulaXII. The preferred organometallic compounds are vinylmagnesium bromide or vinyl lithium The alcohol of formulaXIII may then be converted into the corresponding ether of formula V by any convenient method. Where R represents a methoxymethyl group, this can be carried out by reaction with triethylmethoxymethyl ammonium chloride in acetonitrile. The hydrogenation of the compounds of formula I may be carried out by any convenient method, for example by means of hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst such as platinum or palladium, with or without a support such as carbon or Raney nickel. The compounds of general formula I possess, both in the solid state and in solution in organic solvents such as those conventionally used in perfumery, powerful and intense odours of the general type of patchouli oil, but free from odours of the other odorant components of patchouli oil, in particular from the odours of the terpenes present in patchouli oil. The compound of formula II possesses a strong and warm odour of patchouli which has particular woody aspects and has an odour which is dry and has good tenacity. The compound of formula III has a strong and warm odour of patchouli with agreste features and which is gentle and soothing in nature. The compound of formula IV has a warm and strong odour of patchouli with spicy side notes.The compounds of general formulaI may thus with advantage be used in many perfumes, as well as for perfuming various industrial products, such as solid and liquid detergents, synthetic washing agents, aerosols, and cosmetic products of all kinds. The amount in which the compounds of general formula I can be used in odorant compositions varies within wide limits. The compounds can thus be incorporated in products in amounts of from 0.5 to 20 by weight, preferably from 0.5 to 5 by weight. Example 1 2 g of 2,6,6 trimethyl cyclohexadien 3,5 one are placed in a 50 ml flask, provided with a side tube, equipped with a reflux condenser and a dropping funnel.15 ml of xylene are added and the mixture is refluxed for one hour. Then, 2 ml of acrolein are introduced portionwise over 90 minutes and the mixture is again refluxed for four hours.

Example 4 The process of Example 3 is repeated using 7 anti acetyll,3,3 trimethyl bicyclo2,2,2 oct 5 en 2 one as the starting material. There is thus obtained 6 oxo acetyl 1,3,3 trimethyl bicyclo 2,2,2 octan 2 one. Example 5 2.05 g of piperidinium acetate are placed in a 50 ml flask, 25 ml of dry benzene and 2.20 g of 1,8,8 trimethyl 7 oxo bicyclo 2, 2, 2 oct 5 ene 2 endo carboxyldehyde are added and the mixture is heated for 4 hours at reflux.Then, the mixture is left to cool, poured into a separating funnel and 20 ml of water and 60 ml of diethyl ether are added. The ethereal phase is decanted, washed three times with 20 ml of water and dried over magnesium sulphate. There is thus obtained a mixture of the starting substance and of its epimer 1,5,5 trimethyl 6 oxo bicyclo 2,2,2 octane 2 exo carboxaldehyde. The two epimers are separated by distillation under reduced pressure. Example 6 20.4 g of sodium hydride under oil is washed three times with 100 ml of dry petroleum ether under nitrogen with stirring. 600 ml of dry tetrahydrofuran and 66.3 g of 1,8,8 trimethyl 7 oxo bicyclo 2,2,2 oct 5 ene 2 endo carboxaldehyde are added, the temperature is raised to 40 C and subsequently the mixture is refluxed for 8 hours.After cooling, the mixture is poured into a well stirred phosphate buffer solution 680 g potassium biphosphate and 710 g disodium phosphate in 5 litres of water under an inert atmosphere, extracted three times with 200 ml of petroleum ether and washed with 60 ml of the above buffer solution. After distillation off of the solvent, 68 g of a crude product is obtained Yield 102 . Capillary vapour phase chromatography showed that the ratio of endo to exo isomer was 20 80.

The methanol is then distilled off in vacuo, the viscous residue is treated with 20 ml of water and 100 ml of diethyl ether and then neutralised with 10 hydrochloric acid. The organic phase is separated and the aqueous phase is again extracted with 30 ml of ether.The ethereal phases are combined and washed with 25 ml of a saturated solution of sodium chloride, then dried over magnesium sulphate.
