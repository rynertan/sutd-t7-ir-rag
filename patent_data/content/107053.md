The peptides of the present invention represented by the general formulae 1 through 7 can be prepared by conventional processes for synthesizing peptides more specifically, using processes as described in Schroder andLuhke, The Peptides, vol. 1 1966 , published by AcademicPress, New York, U.S.A., or Izumiya et al., Synthesis of peptides, 1975 , published by Maruzen Publishing Co., Ltd., for example, an azide process, a chloride process, an acid anhydride process, a mixed anhydride process, a DCC process, an active ester process a p nitrophenyl ester process, anN hydroxysuccinimide ester process, a cyanomethyl ester process, etc. , a process using a Woodward reagent K, a carbodiimidazoie process, an oxidative reduction process, a DCC additive HONB, HOBt, HOSu process, etc. Solid phase and liquid phase syntheses are both applicable to the foregoing processes. The peptides of the present invention are prepared in accordance witn the aforesaid processes for synthesizing ordinary polypeptides, generally either by a so called stepwise process which comprises condensing an amino acid to the terminal amino acid one by one in sequence, or by coupling fragments divided into several groups to the terminal amino acid. In more detail, for example, in case that a solid phase synthesis is adopted, the C terminal amino acid is bound to an insoluble carrier through its carboxyl group.The insoluble carrier is not particularly limited as long as it has a binding capability to a reactive carboxyl group.Examples of such insoluble carriers include halogenomethyl resins such as chloromethyl resin, bromomethyl resin, etc. hydroxymethyl resins, phenol resins, tert alkyloxycarbonylhydrazided resins, etc. After the amino protective group is removed, an amino group protected amino acid is bound in sequence in accordance with the amino acid sequence shown by general formulae 1 through 7 through condensation of its reactive amino group and the reactive carboxyl group, in sequence, to synthesize step by step. After synthesizing the complete sequence, the peptide is split off from the insoluble carrier to produce the protein. In the foregoing process, it is preferred that respective amino acids of histidine, arginine, tyrosine, glutamic acid, threonine, lysine, aspartic acid and serine be protected at the side chain functional groups. These functional groups at the side chain are protected with ordinary protective groups which are split off after completion of the reaction. The functional groups which take part in the reaction are generally activated. These processes are known and reagents used in these processes are also appropriately chosen from known ones. Examples of protective groups for amino groups include a benzyloxycarbonyl, Boc, tert amyloxycarbonyl, isobornyloxycarbonyl, p methoxybenzyloxyearbonyl, C1 Z, adamantyloxycarbonyl, trifluoroacetyl, phthalyl, formyl, o nitrophenylsulfenyl, diphenylphosphinothioyl group, etc. Examples of protective groups for the imino group of histidine include a Tos, Bzl, benzyloxycarbonyl, trityl group, etc. Examples of protective groups for arginine include aTos, nitro, benzyloxycarbonyi group, etc. Examples of protective groups for the hydroxy groups of serine and threonine include a Bzl, tert butyl, acetyl, tetrahydropyranyl group, etc. Examples of protective groups for the hydroxy group of tyrosine include a Bzl, C12 Bzl, benzyloxycarbonyl, acetyl, Tos group, etc. Examples of protective groups for the amino group of lysine include a benzyloxycarbonyl, C1 Z, C12 Bzl, Boc, Tos group, etc. Protection for the carboxyl groups of glutamic acid and aspartic acid includes esterification of the carboxylic acids with benzyl alcohol, methanol, ethanol, tert butanol, etc. Examples of activated carboxyl groups include the corresponding acid chlorides, acid anhydrides or mixed acid anhydrides, azides, active esters esters with pentachlorophenol, p nitrophenol, N hydroxysuccinimide, N hydroxybenzotriazole, N hydroxy 5 norbornene 2,3 dicarboxydiimide, etc. In some cases, the peptide bond forming reaction may also be carried out in the presence of carbodiimide reagents such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, carbodiimidazole, etc. or tetraethylpyrophosphine, etc. Hereafter, the preparation of the peptides in accordance with the present invention will be explained more specifically with reference to reaction equations below, as an example.

Of the foregoing, preferred A includes Boc, a benzyloxycarbonyl group, a p methoxybenzyloxycarbonyl group or the like and preferred R1 includes chloromethylated polystyrene or the like, respectively. In case that amino acids used possess functional groups at the side chain thereof which do not participate in each of the reactions, the amino acids are protected by the protective groups described above in a conventional manner and the protective groups are split off at the same time as splitting off of the insoluble carrier R1. In the processes described above, the reaction of the amino acid a with the insoluble carrier R1 b is carried out by utilizing the reactive carboxyl group of the amino acid a and binding it to R1 in a conventional manner. The reaction is effected in an appropriate solvent in the presence of basic compounds, e.g., triethylamine, potassium tert butoxide, cesium carbonate, cesium hydroxide, etc., in the case of using, e.g., chloromethylated polystyrene. Examples of solvents include dimethylformamide DMF , dimethylsulfoxide DMSO , pyridine, chloroform, dioxan, dichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran, N methylpyrrolidone, hexamethylphosphoric acid triamide, etc. or a mixture solvent thereof.

It is preferred that the acid be used in an amount of generally 5 to 10 times that of the raw compound. In case that the protective group A alone is wished to be split off in the acidolysis, it is preferred to use trifluoroacetic acid or hydrogen chloride as the acid.The aforesaid reduction with metallic sodium in liquid ammonia can be carried out generally at temperatures of about 40 to about 700C, using metallic sodium in such an amount that is colored to permanent blue for about 30 seconds to about 10 minutes.

There is no particular limitation to the amount of the dehydrating and condensing agent to be used, either the agent is generally employed preferably in an equimolar amount to that of the amino acid d . The reaction temperature is suitably chosen from a normal range conventionally used for peptide, bond forming reactions, generally from the range of about 40 to about 600C, preferably from the range of about 20 to about 40 C.

Thus, the peptide shown by general formula e can be introduced into the peptide represented by general formula f . These condensation and splitting off of the protective group A are carried out in a manner similar to those described above. The thus obtained peptide f can be introduced into the peptide shown by general formula 5 by splitting of the protective group A, splitting off of the protective groups of the amino acid at the side chain thereof and removing the insoluble carrier R1 Here the removal of the protective groups at the side chain functional groups and the insoluble carrier R1 can be carried out in a manner similar to the splitting off of the protective group A in this case, it is preferred to use hydrogen fluoride, or hydrogen bromide as the acid. All of the amino acids used in the aforesaid processes may be those commercially available.

After completion of the reaction, the thus obtained antigen can easily be isolated and purified by means of a dialysis method, a gel filtration method, a fractionation precipitation method, etc. The thus obtained antigen binds 5 to 60 mols in average of the peptide thereto per 1 mole of a protein and enables to subsequent preparation of an antibody having a high specificity to the antigen. In the case of the peptide shown by general formula 1 , an antigen to which the peptide is bound in an amount of 5 to 20 molls, preferably 8 to 15 molls, in average, per 1 mole of a protein. The preparation of an antibody using the antigen is carried out by administering the aforesaid antigen to mammals to thereby produce a desired antibody in vivo and collecting the antibody. While there is no particular limitation to mammals provided for the preparation of antibodies, it is generally preferred to use rabbits or guinea pigs. In the production of antibodies, a definite amount of the antigen obtained as described above is diluted with a physiological saline solution to a suitable concentration and the resulting dilution is mixed with a complete Freundgs adjuvant to prepare a suspension. The suspension is administered to mammals. For example, the aforesaid suspension is intracutaneously administered 1 to 5 mg time as the amount of the antigen to rabbit. Then the suspension is administered every two weeks over a period of 2 to 10 months, preferably 4 to 6 months to effect immunization.The collection of the antibody is carried out by collecting blood from the immunized animal after the passage of 1 to 2 weeks subsequent to the final administration, centrifuging the blood and isolating serum from the blood. According to this procedure, an antibody having an excellent specificity to the antigen used can be collected and used for assaying human leukemia virusrelated proteins utilizing RIA, EIA, etc. For purposes of explaining the present invention in more detail, preparations of the peptides shown by general formulae 1 to 7 , antigens obtained from the peptides and antibodies will be shown by way of examples but the present invention is not deemed to be limited thereto.
