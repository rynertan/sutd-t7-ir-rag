# PRODUCTION OF ALKOXYALKYL PHOSPHATE ESTERS

## Abstract
A process for the production of alkoxyalkyl triorganic phosphates utilizing a continuous process for the manufac ture of alkoxyalkyl alkoxides comprising treating an alkoxyal kanol with a sodium borohydride for 20 minutes to 4 hours reacting the treated alkoxyalkanol continuously with an alkali metal hydroxide to form an alkali metal alkoxide. A large excess of alcohol is employed. The alkoxide is phosphory lated to form a trialkoxyalkyl phosphate. The alkoxidation reaction and the phosphorylation reaction are both con ducted in a non oxidizing atmosphere. The crude product is then refined by conventional means.
