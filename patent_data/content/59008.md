# Production of a planographic printing plate through the silver complex diffusion transfer process.

## Abstract
Process for the production of a planographic printing plate according to the silver complex diffusion transfer rever sal process comprising the steps of image wise photo exposing a silver halide emulsion layer de veloping the resultant latent image in the presence of a silver halide complexing agent and contacting the exposed silver ha lide emulsion material with an anodized aluminium plate characterized in that the thickness of the anodized surface lay er is in the range of 0.50 to 2.00 Âµm, the anodized plate has been hydration sealed in the temperature range of 60 80 C, and the development of the light sensitive material is carried out with a developing composition having a pH of at least 12, and containing dissolved sulphite, dissolved thiosulphate, and a mixture of hydroquinone and at least one secondary deve loping agent of the class of 1 phenyl 3 pyrazolidinones and p N methylaminophenol.
