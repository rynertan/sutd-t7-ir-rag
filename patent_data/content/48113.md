# Apparatus and method for perforating tubing.

## Abstract
In an apparatus for producing thermoplastic tubing, the apparatus being of the type comprising a pair of complemen tary mold assembies providing recirculating mold units 13 which cooperate in pairs along a forward run to define a mold cavity 23 25 , each mold unit 13 comprises a transversely displaceable die member 21 providing a plurality of half molds which can be selectively displaced to an operative position. The apparatus includes selectively operable cam means 32 37 positioned along the return runs of the mold units for selectively engaging the die members 21 . The half molds 23 25 in each die member 21 are configured differently, there being at least one with a smooth inner surface 24 and at least one 23, 25 with a corrugated inner surfacing.
