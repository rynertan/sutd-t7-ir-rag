# Broadcast receiver with automatic broadcast station storage.

## Abstract
A broadcast receiver comprises a mixer 3 to which an aerial signal and an oscillator signal are applied for generating an intermediate frequency signal. The oscillator signal is pro duced by a generator 4 and its frequency is determined by a tuning value which is applied to the generator. In addition, the receiver comprises a number of N preselection keys 12 to each ofwhicha predetermined fixed tuning value is assigned, so that by operating such a key that relevant tuning value is directly applied to the generator. Assigning a tuning value to a preselection key is automated and is effected by a micro computer 10 . This micro computer produces for that pur pose a fixed sequence of auxiliary tuning values which are sequentially applied to the generator. The intermediate frequency signal obtained in response to each auxiliary tun ing value is converted into a test value in a conversion circuit. These test values are compared to one or more reference test values from a fixed sequence of reference test values of decreasing sinificance. Those N tuning values whose associ ated test values are equal to the reference test values of the highest possible significance are now assigned to the pre selection keys so that only those tuning values are assigned to the preselection keys which correspond to the broadcast transmissions with the greatest signal strength in the overall wave range.
