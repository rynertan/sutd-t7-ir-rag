# Improved process for preparing calcium hypochlorite.

## Abstract
In a continuous process for preparing granular calcium hypochlorite particles, wherein hydrated triple salt crystals of calcium hypochlorite, sodium hypochlorite, and sodium chloride are reacted with a chlorinated lime slurry to form an aqueous paste slurry of calcium hypochlorite dihydrate particles, a part of this slurry is continuously recycled to the reactor, the remaining slurry is processed to separate the calcium hypochlorite dihydrate particles and the resulting particles are dried to form granular calcium hypochlorite particles.
