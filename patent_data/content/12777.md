# Method using a programmed digital computer system for translation between natural languages.

## Abstract
A Computerized translation method with universal appli cation to all natural languages is provided. With this method, parameters are changed only when source or target lan guages are changed. The computerized method can be regarded as a self contained system, having been developed to accept input texts in the source language, and look up individual or sequences of textwords in various dictionaries. On the basis of the dictionary information, sequences of oper ations are carried out which gradually generate the multiplic ity of computer codes needed to express all the syntactic and semantic functions of the words in the sentence. On the basis of all the codes and target meanings in the dictionary, plus synthesis codes of such meanings, translation is carried out automatically. Procedures which generate and easily update main dictionaries, idiom dictionaries, high frequency dic tionaries and compound dictionaries are integral parts of the system.

## Description
METHOD USING A PROGRAMMED DIGITAL COMPUTER SYSTEM FOR TRANSLATION BETWEEN NATURAL LANGUAGESThis invention relates to a method utilizing a digital computer for translating between natural languages.Attempts have been made to utilize digital computers for translating from one language to another, i.e., from a source language to a target language. The translation systems involve a programmable digital computer system along with a program for effecting the translation. The approaches used were theoretical. The theoretical language approach for syntactical analysis has not been acceptable because it starts out from linguistic assumptions instead of considering the capabilities of the programmable digital computer and approaching the translation from the computers point.of view.The idea of machine translation was conceived in 1946 by Warren Weaver and A.D. Booth. Many attempts to achieve a machine translation system and put it into operation have been made. The projects were directed toward developing linguistic theories encompassing the whole natural language and then geing to the computer. This approach inevitablySailed because the human mind cannot encompass the totality of the language. The following is a brief resume in the approaches and the theory behind them The General Analysis Technique GAT Institute ofLanguages and Linguistics Machine Translation ResearchCenter, Washington DC Juni 1959, by Peter Toma, Edited by J.A. Mayne used a linguistics oriented computer coding scheme. Ad hoc solutions were introduced and the whole system was confined within a hollow restricted so calledSimulated Linguistic Computer SLC system written in octal language and not open for any further improvements.The Fulcrum theory approach developed from 1959 to 1967 by the Bunker Ramo Corporation, USA, was directed toward solving, with a relatively small dictionary, the problems occuring in a limited Russian text. No attempt was made to introduce resolution of multiple meanings instead, several meanings were printed in the output, separated by slashes.A predictive syntax system was developed by the NationalBureau of Standards and Massachusetts institute of Technology in 1960 to 1964. This approach failed because it considered only one limited path to the sentence. This system was never implemented on a larger scale, but was used just within a limited experimental environment.Transformational grammar was another approach. However, this approach turned out to be absolutely incompatible with computer translation requirements. Only small experimental systems have becn developed on the basis of this theory, and the had to be discontinued before any significant translation was produced. As compared to the propr art it is an object of the invention to enable assurate, Fast, almost instaptang us Translation of large volumes of texts from one source language i.e. natural language into another natural language, the so called target language.Instead of a natural language an artificial language as par example Esperanto can act as source or target language as the case may be.To achieve this purpose the subject matter of the present invention is a method using a programmable digital computer system, the steps comprising a converting a source text to be translated from visual indicia to computer intelligible binary coded signals b storing in a main memory of the computer system the converted source text to be translated c scanning and comparing such converted source text words with dictionaries of source language words stored in a memory and for each source text word for which a match is found, storing in a file in main memory each word and sic in ssociation with each such word, coded information derived from such dictionary fo use in translation of such word, the coded information including memory offset adress linkages to a memory in the computer system where grammar and target language translations for the word are stored analyzing the convexted source text words in the file of words, a complete sentence at a time, and converting the same into a sentence in the target language utilising the coded information and including the steps of 1 utilisang the memory offset adresse Einkages for obtaining the target language translations of words from a memory and 2 reordering the target language translation into the proper target language sequence e converting the target language seauence from computer intelligible binary coded signals back to visual indicia.f printing the target language.Advantageously the method comprises a step wherein a special subroutine of the dictionary lookup process searches a list of words lexical list to determine which words require the incorporation of a special lexical subroutine into the dictionary file and.a separate lexical control program analyzes the words of the source language sentence for those cases when only the results of the syntactic semantic analysis of the sentence or the membership of a word in a grammatical or semantic class can determine wehther or not a lexical subroutine must be called in at the time of translation of a specific word or expression in order to determine the meaning of that word o expression by examining the syntactic relationships which have been established for said word or expression and utilizing syntactic and or semantic rules which apply only to that word or the class of words to which it belongs. There is advantageonsly provided a methed of resolving semantic ambigbities, wherein cach word in the stem single word dictionary is assigned a unique limited semantic LS number, and the specialized multi word expressions of the LS compound dictionary LS expressions which are composed of the LS number representation of their individual words in the stem dictionary, are then automatically grouped into a dictionary record according to the principal word of the expression, one existing for each unique principal word, and the record is then searched whenever the principal word occurs in the sentence to be translated, in order to determine if a match exists between a group of contiguous words in the text and any of the expressions in that record, the longest match or the highest priority expression being used to determine the specialized meaning of that group of words, which differs from the sum of the meaning of the individual words a subset of an Ls expression is the conditional limited semantic CLS expression, which permits the inclusion of all definable syntactic and semantic rules, as well as simple programming instructions which can be used to change the information stored in the bits and bytes of the sentence analysis area, in the L3 expression itself i.E. in the dictionary , so that the dictionary expression is only matched when the syntactic and or semantic conditions expressed in the rule s have been met by the word s in the texte this fact being determinable only after a complete syntactic and semantic analysis of the sentence has been carried out by the linguistic analysis programs. In the method advantageously all source language wcrds can be supplied with semantic category codes in a variable length format, which are then interrogated by by the source language analysis programs, the lexica routines, and the CLS dictionary lookup routines as an aid in resolving semantic ambiguities these codes are expressed in a hierarchical taxonomy set of tree structures in such a way that the coding of a category which exists at a lower level of a semantic tree generates the automatic coding of the appropriate higher level codes by the system itself.The invention involves a method of operating a digital computer to translate from a source natural language, e.g. Russian, to a target natural language, e.g.English. The, method involves three phases. The dictionary look up phase establishes the target language meaning of each word or expression in the source text.This dictionary look up phase attaches grammatical codes and target language equivalents to each word and expression in the source language. The syntactical analysis phase identifies syntactical information on the basis of the grammatical information attached to the words and expressions and also utilizes the inflection of the word and the posItion of the word in the source text. The synthesis phase takes the meaning and syntactical information of all the words of a sentence in the source text and forms a sentence in the target language.More specifically, the method begins by loading the source text into the memory of a computer. Each source text word is then transformed Into a converted source text word. The converted source text word consists of the source text word and coded information.The coded information may include a memory offset adress linkage which provides access to a memory location that contains syntactical information and translation for the source text word. The converted source text words which derive from a source text sentence are then synthesized into a target language translation of that sentence. The synthesis correctly establishes both word meaning and word position in the target language sentence. An important aspect of the invention is the separate treatment given high frequency versus low frequency words. In order to maximize the effective capacity of the core memory of the computer, the low frequency words carry their translation information along with them, while each of the hiSh frequence words carries a memory offset address linkage which allds easy access to its translation information which is stored in the core memory. Thus, the translation information for frequently used words is held in an easily accessible place in the computer rather than along with every occurrence of the word as is done for low frequency words. While the above description portrays a human analogy of how the claimed invention functions, it must be understood that, in fact, the actual operation of the process by the computer is quite different. From the time that the source text is converted to machine readable input data until the time that the machine readable output data is converted to human readable translation text, the claimed process procedes under the control of a cote program.While it is convenient to describe the steps of. the program as if they were being performed b a human translator, in fact, nothing of the kind is happening Rather, the computer is carrping out a series of unthinking, abstract mathematical operations on the abstract values stored in the memory of the computer. The program functions independently of the meaning or significance of the data on which it is acting. The fact that the program is formed in a high level programming language, which makes the program appear to give significance to the machine operation, does not change the fact that the machine is actually carrying out a series of abstract steps which have nothing to do with translating between natural languages.If a different kind of information were fed into the computer, the program used in this invention could conceivably perform a function totally different from translating.The invention comprises also the process by which information is extracted from the computer including printing out the translation i.e. the step converting the target language sequence from computer intelligible binary coded signals back to visual indicia.It is of great advantage that by means of the present invention any source language can be translated into a target language by applying the proposed method and by making use of same equipment, just by changing language dependened parts of the equipment, as dictionaries and linguistic programs which includes the whole syntactic and semantic rules of both languages.Another advantage of the method according to the invention is the consistancy of the translation, i.e. a particular expression is translated from the source language into the target language with tb same environment, if the environment changes the invention correspondingly changes the meaning of the expression with the above mentioned consistancy. Also the recognition of all the syntactic and semantic features of the source language are reflected in the target language is of advantagel.Specific embodiments of the invention will now be described by way pf example with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 illustrates the translation processing,Figure 2 shows the dictionary lookup schematic andFigure 3 shows a summary of programs schematic.As shown in Figure 1 texts are input to the translation system either on line via a terminal or off line via key to disk or key to tape devices. Input via punch cards is also possible . The input text and the translation dictionaries and programs reside on disk files accessible by the computer, which performs the translation. The results are then printed out in the desired format on the printer taking into consideration any format codes in the input text. Post editing of the output text and any resulting dictionary update can take place, if desired, via on line interactive terminal or it can be performed off line by post editors and dictionary codes .Diagrams and tables which must bW included in the same form in the translated output can be incorporated in the text via a photocomposition do vice. Figure 2 illustrates the program which loads the input text into computer memory L ADTXT identifies the high frequency words and the idioms in the text and assigns each word of the text a unique serial number. It immediately attaches a translation to the idioms and ensures that the information for all the high frequency words is immediately available in computer core memory during the translation process.The remaining low frequency words are then sorted into alphabetic order to facilitate the process of.main dictionary look up MDL . Main dictionary look up attaches to each low frequency word the necessary grammatical information as well as a cross reference to the record of multi word limited semantic LS compounds containing that word. After main dictionary look up all the words in the text are re sorted into their original sequence.According to Figure 3, the program INITCALL controls the actual translation process. It first calls the program GETSENTN, which establishes a sentence analysis area in computer memory, consisting of 160 bytes of fixed length information for each word, with crossreferences to additional variable length information areas. 4At first the sentence analysis area contains only the dictionary information for each word, During the translation process, additional information is added by the source language analysis programs refered to as passes which resolve synatic and semantic ambiguities, astablish clause boundaries, described besis syatactical relationship between words, identify subject pradicate relationships and analyze the function of any prepositions. Limited semantic LS and conditioned limited semantic CLS dictionary look up takes place at appropriate points in the analysis, conditioned limited semantic look up being possible only after the entire sentence has been analyzed.The remaining four steps, which synthezize the target language on the basis of the total information contained in the sentence analysis area, are the translation of prepositions, the solving of word specific problems by lexical routines, the actual synthesis of the target language words, and the rearrangement of the sentence into the word order appropriate to the target language.The final step in the translation processis printing of the translated output by programm TRPRINT.
