## Description
A SEPARATOR ELECTROLYTIC CELL PROVIDING GLOVE SHAPED MEMBRANES BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a separator electrolytic cell. More particularly, it relates to a finger type electrolytic cell inexpensive in manufacture and suitable for a large capacity which facilitates installation or removal of a separator, especially a cation exchange membrane and further simplifies assemblage or disassemblage of anodes and cathodes.2. Description of the Prior Art As a process for production of an alkali metal hydroxide by the electrolysis of an aqueous alkali metal halide solution, above all, an aqueous alkali metal chloride solution, there has been heretofore proposed and practiced commercially electrolytic processes using a separator such as cation exchange membranes. In these days environmental pollution coming from mercurial processes has come to the fore and accordingly these processes are rapidly being substituted for the mercurial processes. Most of the electrolytic cells used for these processes are filter press type cells in which, for instance, a separator such as an ion exchange membrane and a microporous membrane is positioned between a cathode compartment frame and an anode compartment frame to give a unit and several or several tens of the units are assembled.The cells of such type are limited in a size of each compartment and a separator has to be positioned to every unit, so that it is difficult to assemble so many units. Moreover, to each compartment a supply inlet for a solution to be electrolysed and a removal outlet for a liquor after electrolysis have to be provided. A great number of supply inlets and removal outlets provided in the anode and the cathode compartments not only require voluminous and complicated operation of connecting many units to each other upon assemblage, but also inrease a risk of leakage of liquors produced by the electrolysis from connected portions. Furthermore a risk of leakage from connected portions between the compartment frames also increases inevitably as the number of compartment frames connected increases, which is said to be a fatal disadvantage to the filter press type cells.To prevent this disadvantage a strict mechanical tolerance in design as well as manufacture is needed, thereby inviting an increase in cost of manufacturing. In addition, as the number of compartment frames increases, a greater pressing force must be exerted to thus result in an increased risk of physical damages of the compartment frames and an increased cost. For the foregoing reasons it is next to impossible to manufacture a filter press type cell of low cost and large capacity. On the other hand, cation exchange membranes are normally produced in a form of thin sheet with the thickness of several hundred microns and limited dimensions because of making the most use of the performance thereof and of commercial factors in manufacture. That may be a reason why a filter press type cell is widely used as an electrolytic cell bearing a cation exchange membrane. In order to eliminate the foregoing defects, JapaneseUtility Novel non examined publication No. 51,333 1977 discloses an electrolytic cell which comprise s anode and cathode compartments having continuously meandering concavo convex anode and cathode, respectively, and a continuous film like separator interposed between the anode and the cathode, the anode and cathode compartments are assembled in such a manner that the concave of the cathode or the anode and the convex of the anode or the cathode are interleaved with the separator intervened therebetween. In the electrolytic cell of this type, however, to avoid physical damages of a separator, a gasket or a spacer must be employed to thereby maintain a clearance given between the cathode and the anode to prevent both electrodes from coming in contact with each other.Because of the clearance, cell voltage increases to thus interfere with the object of enlargement of scale. In view of the above situation, there is a great need for an electrolytic cell to which a long size thin film like cation exchange membrane or microporous membrane can be installed as it is and which enables the scale up of the cell. In the light of the foregoing problems and the present situation, the present inventors have made an extensive series of study on the development of an electrolytic cell of a large capacity bearing a long size of a separator such as a cation exchange membrane and have already proposed a novel separator electrolytic cell comprised of a plurality of anodes mounted at the bottom plate and a cathode box providing fingers interleaved between adjacent anodes, to the side surfaces of said fingers a sheet like separator being installed by means of separator installation devices located above or below the fingers.This proposed invention provides a superior electrolytic cell which eliminates the foregoing problems the conventional arts have it has still a drawback that a fairly lot of labor is needed in securing the sheet like separator to the separator installation devices, and thus a measure for reduction of said labor is expected. U.S. Pat. No. 4,175,024 discloses an electrolytic cell which is comprised of electrodes interleaved between electrodes of opposite polarity, to which cathode electrodes an enveloping synthetic separator is secured.While the electrolytic cell of this type is likely to save operation in securing the separator to the separator installation devices by intricate securing means, a lap expanding outwardly from the open end periphery of the separator has to be provided to the enveloping separator in order to ensure the tight sealing and has to be placed between an anode and a back screen, then fastened together.However, formation of the separator in such a shape is not necessarily easy and an anode plate of a complicated construction is required, thus leaving some problems on the practical usefulness. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a separator electrolytic cell bearing gloveshaped membranes, in which the glove shaped membranes are feasibly installed. It is another object of the present invention to provide a separator electrolytic cell bearing gloveshaped membranes which facilitates assembly and disassembly and provides tight sealing to thereby prevent leakage of electrolytes. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a separator electrolytic cell bearing gloveshaped membranes which permits conversion of existing asbestos diaphragm electrolytic cells to ion exchange membrane electrolytic cells. These and other objects of the present invention together with the advantages thereof will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the detailed disclosure of the present invention as set forth hereinbelow. The present invention encompasses a novel separator electrolytic cell bearing glove shaped membranes characterized in that on a releasable lateral plate one polar electrodes of either cathodes or anodes are mounted substantially vertical to the lateral plate and a bottom plate and on at least one wall plate comprising another lateral plate opposing the foregoing lateral plate, the bottom plate and a cell top cover the other polar electrodes are mounted substantially parallel to and facing close to the foregoing electrodes, said electrodes mounted on the releasable lateral plate being covered with glove shaped separators secured to a separator installation support shading said lateral plate, said separator possessing an open end in which said electrode is inserted. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Fig. la, Fig. lb and Fig. lc are a front view, a top plan view and a side view, respectively, of a separator installation support. Fig. 2 is an illustrative view showing steps of forming a glove shaped separator used in the electrolytic cell of the present invention. Fig. 3 is a schematic illustration showing the securing of the separator to the separator installation support. Fig. 4 is a horizontal schematic sectional. view of the electrolytic cell of the present invention. Fig. 5 is a schematic vertical sectional view of the electrolytic cell of the present invention in parallel to an electrode plate. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In Fig. la to Fig. lc, the separator installation support 1 is basically of a flat plate shape having sufficient area to cover a releasable lateral palte of the electrolytic cell and is equipped with open portions 2 , 2 , 2 which permit passage of electrodes mounted on the lateral plate. On the open portions 2 , 2 , 2 collars 3 are protruded along their periphery substantially vertical to the separator installation support 1 . The separator installation support 1 as aforesaid may be made of an anti corrosive and heat resistant synthetic resin including polyvinyl chloride, chlorinated polyvinyl chloride, a fluorinated resin such as polytetrafluoroethylene, polyethylenetetrafluoroethylene and polyvinylidene fluoride, a material lined with the foregoing resins or rubbers, an anti corrosive metal such as titanium, a titanium paradium alloy and stainless steel, and the like. The separator installation support material is preferably an insulated material resistant to both anodic and cathodic solutions. The surface and the reverse side of the separator installation support may also be made of different materials resistant to each solution they are in contact with. Fig. 2 illustrates steps of forming the separator 4 secured to the separator installation support 1 shown in Fig. la to Fig. lc, in which a sheet like separator shown in the step I is folded down at a central fold 6 as shown in the step 7 , then in the step lEE two end brims 7 8 are bonded together. By those steps the glove shaped separator 4 , as depicted in the step IV , having an open end is obtained. As the separator, a cation exchange membrane or a microporous membrane may be suitably used and to the present electrolytic cell is a cation exchange membrane the most preferable. The cation exchange membrane suitably used in the present electrolytic cell may preferably be made of a polymer having a fluorine containing backbone with pendant cation exchange groups such as sulfonic acid groups, carboxylic acid groups and phosphoric acid groups, singly or in combination of two or more. The glove shaped separator 4 so formed as to possess the shape and the length equal to the inner peripheral length of the collar 3 protruded on the separator installation support 1 may be bonded or welded in its open end to and along the inner periphery of the collar 3 , but may be secured more advantageously by a mechanical means which enables the exchanging of the separator. A practical example for the securing of the separator by a mechanical means will be explained relating to Fig. 3. The open end of the glove shaped separator 4 is inserted in the open portion 2 of the separator installation support 1 , then placed between the collar 3 and a pressing plate 9 , and further a packing 10 is interposed between the separator 1 and the collar 3 , these being secured together by the use of clips made of an anti corrosive material such as titanium.The separator securing process depicted as above only illustrates a typical exemplification and accordingly there may be suitably applied a variety of securing means and instruments including bolts and nuts, clips, spring clips, clamps, springs, singly or in combination of two or more, which are suggested in JapaneseUtility Model Application Nos. 178,714 1977, 107,197 1978, 57,341 1979 and 91,756 1979. As a material for the securing means, titanium is preferred for use in the anode compartment and ss, sus, etc. are preferred for use in the cathode compartment, but it is not particularly limited unless corrosive to anodic and cathodic solutione. The packing 10 may be preferably in the form of a string, a flat sheet or.a protrusion provided sheet made of a foamed article of polytetrafluoroethylene, a rubber or the like. The pressing plate 9 may preferably be made of titanium, SS, SUS, a synthetic resin, a glassfibre reinforced resin or the like. A separator installation apparatus by the use of a mechanical means as mentioned in detail earlier ensures and facilitates the installation of a separator 4 to and along the collar 3 on the separator installation support, so that changing of the separator damaged or blocked is possible very feasibly, thereby being by far superior as compared with bonding, welding or the like. The installation of the separator by the mechanical securing means is in fact of exceeding importance even for the following reasons, especially when a cation exchange membrane is used as a separator. That is, it is required to position the separator as tight as possible between the cathodes and the anodes. The cation exchange membrane normally expands and contracts according to moisture contained in the circumstances, while a microporous membrane exhibits almost no such a phenomenon.Accordingly the cation exchange membrane, even when installed as tightly as possible in the air, is apt to expand to thereby produce slack and wrinkles during the operation since it comes into contact with an aqueous alkali metal halide solution and an aqueous alkali metal hydroxide liquor. Slack and wrinkles necessarily cause residence of halogen gas at the anode side of the membrane, thus resulting in low quality of the product.Inversely, at the cathode side of the membrane, release of hydrogen gas is prevented to produce gas gap, thereby leading to an increase in the cell voltage. Therefore, prior to the installation of the membrane to the ceil, it is at first wetted with water, brine or an aqueous alkali metal hydroxide liquor then installed in a wet condition. In the installation of the membrane in a foregoing fashion, a mechanical securing is superior to welding, bonding or cementing, because the wetted membrane can not be welded and bonding of the wetted membrane, even when bonded, not only reduces bonding force, but also causes hydrolysis of adhesives. Furthermore, however tight the membrane may be installed, slack or wrinkles will occur during the course of operation over a long period of time. In such cases, when the membrane is installed by a mechanical means, slack and wrinkles can be easily removed by doing even again, thus operation being further continued without slack and wrinkles. Next, description will be made by referring to Fig.4 and Fig. 5 which show a state that a globe shaped finger fabricated by securing the glove shaped separator 4 to the separator installation support 1 is assembled together with the electrodes in the cell. In these figures, electrodes 14 for example, anodes are mounted parallel on the bottom plate 13 and a lateral plate 15 positioned in parallel to a row of the electrodes 14 is releasable. On the lateral plate 15 are the other electrodes 16 for example, cathodes mounted parallel to and facing close to the electrodes 14 . The glove shaped finger comprising the separator installation support 1 and the glove shaped separator 4 is placed between the lateral plate 15 and flanges 17 , 17 and 17 provided at the edges of the cell 12 and fastened tight in such a way that the collar 3 is located near the lateral plate 15 , i.e., the separator 4 protrudes into the cell.Between the flanges 17 , 17 , 17 and the separator installation support Cl gaskets 18 are interposed and between the separator installation support 1 and the lateral plate 15 sheetlike packings 19 are interposed to provide tight sealing. The open portions 2 2 and the gloveshaped separators 4 4 are decided upon beforehand in dimensions and relative position so that the electrodes 16 16 are inserted in the glove shaped separators 4 4 through the open portions 2 2 of the separator installation support 1 , when the glove shaped finger is so assembled. The so assembled cell is comprised of a first electrode compartment 20 for example, cathode compartment surrounded with the releasable lateral plate 15 and the glove shaped finger, and a second electrode compartment 21 for example, anode compartment surrounded with the remaining cell walls and the gloveshaped finger. As is apparent from the foregoing description, the first electrode compartment 20 is provided with electrodes 16 for example, cathodes and the second electrode compartment 21 is provided with opposite polar electrodes 14 for example, anodes . As a cathode, a lath, a foraminous plate and the like is preferable which is made of SS, SUS and the like. As an anode, an anti corrosive anode is preferred which is made of a platinum group metal, an alloy thereof or a metal lined with oxides thereof. In cases, as shown in Fig. 5, where the bottom plate 13 on which electrodes 14 are mounted is releasably secured using a packing 22 to a flange 23 located at the bottom of the cell, assembly or disassembly for exchange of electrodes 14 in the second electrode compartment 21 is markedly facilitated. In an embodiment as mentioned above, there is depicted that the glove shaped finger is secured to the lateral surface of the cell 12 by securing it to the lateral plate 15 on which the electrodes 16 are mounted and the other electrodes 14 are mounted on the bottom plate 13 , but a variety of modifications are possible in a direction of mounting the electrodes 14 .That is, the electrodes 14 may be mounted on a lateral plate opposing the lateral palte 15 or on the cell top cover 24 , and likewise the glove shaped finger and the electrodes 16 may also be inserted in the cell upwardly from the bottom plate 13 or downwardly from the top, provided that both electrodes oppose each other maintaining their parallel relationship.It is also one of significant improvements included in the present invention that opposite lateral plates of the cell 12 are allowed to be releasable respectively and either cathodes or anodes are mounted on one of the lateral plates substantially vertical to the lateral plate and the bottom plate and the other electrodes are mounted on at least one cell wall comprising the bottom plate and the cell top cover substantially parallel to and facing close to said electrodes, further the electrodes mounted on the lateral plate are covered with the glove shaped separator secured to the separator installation support having open portions through which said electrodes are passed and shielding said lateral plate, i.e., the cell is fabricated so as to allow glove shaped fingers extending from the opposite two lateral paltes interleave, thereby duplicating the capacity of the cell.Furthermore, it is also possible with ease by selecting a material in contact with a respective electrolyte to provide anodes in the first electrode compartment 20 and to provide cathodes in the second electrode compartment 21 . In the assemblage of the present electrolytic cell, it is preferred to position electrodes 14 in a slightly contracted form in their thickness so as not to damage the glove shaped separator 4 , then to expand them during electrolysis to thus reduce anodes cathodes spacing. The present invention not only provides an advantage of decreasing cell voltage exerted by enlarging the thickness pf electrodes 14 upon electrolysis to bring anodes to cathodes as closely as possible, more preferably to bring anodes and cathodes into contact with both surfaces of the separator, but also realizes enlargement of scale by increasing the length or the number of fingers, while adding no essential difficulties in installation of the separator and assembly of the cell. Although not shown in the accompanying drawings, there are provided, needlessly, to the cell an inlet for water or a diluted aqueous caustic alkali solution, an inlet for brine, an outlet for the product liquor i.e., an aqueous alkali metal hydroxide liquor, outlets for gases generated, i.e., hydrogen gas and a halogen gas, respectively, and an outlet for depleted brine, as is the case with the conventional separator type electrolytic cell. Notwithstanding, when the cell is so constructed that the glove shaped finger is inserted upward from the bottom, a particular device has to be made as to the end portion of fingers with a view to removing gas generated in the first electrode compartment, whichmaydisadvantageously lead to a complicated construction of the cell. Hereinabove, embodiments of the present electrolytic cell were described with reference to the accompanying drawings, but to which embodiments the present invention is not limited and, of course, including a lot of modifications and applications without departure from the scope of the present invention. The present electrolytic cell is constructed such that the glove shaped separator can be prepared by exceedingly simple steps, the lap is no longer required to be provided at the open end, the glove shaped separator can be secured in an exceedingly reduced time by simplified operations and instruments to the separator installation support to give the glove shaped finger, and that a finger type electrolytic cell like a conventional diaphragm electrolytic cell can be provided very feasibly.Furthermore, as compared with a filter press type cell which is generally used when a sheet like separator is employed, it is possible to supply a cell with a greater capacity per the same floor area. That is, a filter press type cell with a capacity of 150 KA at 20 A 2 d 2 per dm requires a floor area of 8 to 10 m , whereas the present electrolytic cell with the same capacity needs only 4 to 6 m2 floor area. Moreover, the present electrolytic cell has numerous advantages that assembly or disassembly is by far easier than any other finger type electrolytic cell having ever been proposed before by the present inventors, and that more perfect sealing is provided to thus prevent leakage of electrolyte. Furthermore the present electrolytic cell is suited to a construction of a mono polar cell and it is also advantageous that it is possible to utilize the existing equipments including a current trnasformer effectively in conversion of a mercurial cell or an asbestos diaphragm cell to an ion exchange membrane cell. As apparent from the foregoing, the present electrolytic cell has a lot of advantages over a filter press type cell. The present electrolytic cell has not so many joints and has a greater capacity per a unit installation area as well as a high efficiency per a unit volume of a cell. It further requires neither expensive materials for parts including cathodes and anodes nor strict mechanical tolerance, thereby resulting in an decrease in production cost. The assembly and disassembly are easy and simple, even if a glove shaped separator is employed, further, sealing is easy so that labor is drastically saved. It not only enables a contact construction, in which anodes and cathodes are in contact with the respective surfaces of the separator, to thus reduce the anodes cathodes spacing to the minimal distance, through which cell voltage is lowered, maintains high current efficiency by keeping concentration of anodic and cathodic solutions uniform, but also realizes the scale up of the equipment with a decreased cost in maintenance as well as operation.
