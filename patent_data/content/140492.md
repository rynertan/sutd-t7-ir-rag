## Description
L ARGININE ISOXICAMATE Isoxicam, 4 hydroxy 2 methyl N 5 methyl 3 isoxazolyl 2H 1,2 benzothiazine 3 carboxamide 1, 1 dioxide, is a nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug described in U.S. patent 3,787,324.The compound is weakly acidic pKa about 3.65 and practically insoluble in water and alcohol. Because of the potential for incomplete or inconsistent bioavailability that often accompanies low aqueous solubility, isoxicam has been formulated in capsule dosage forms using drug that has been micronized or precipitated in microcrystalline form. The N methylglucamine salts of oxicam derivatives have been described in EuropeanPublished Application No. 0002482 and inU.S. Serial Number 488,922 filed on 27thApril 1983. These salts were prepared to enhance the solubility and stability of aqueous solutions of the oxicam derivatives. Water soluble lysine and arginine salts of piroxicam have been described as especially useful for treating arthritis by parenteral administration in European Published Application No. 0066458. According to the present invention there is provided a compound having the nameL arginine isoxicamate. This is a novel salt of isoxicam and exhibits surprisingly greater bioavailability when administered to mammals. The L arginine isoxicamate may have a 1 1 stoichiometry. In this case, the compound may be in an anhydrous, crystalline state. According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a pharmaceutical composition, suitable for use as an anti inflammatory agent or as an analgesic, which comprises an effective amount of L arginine isoxicamate in admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Another aspect of the present invention provides a process for preparing L arginine isoxicamate, which process comprises heatingL arginine and isoxicam together in a solvent.The solvent is preferably aqueous methanol, and the heating is conveniently carried out at the boiling point of the solvent. Isoxicam, its alkali metal, alkaline earth and amine salts, including their method of manufacture and therapeutic properties have been fully described in U.S. Patent 3,787,324. L arginine isoxicamate may be prepared by heating the suspended reactants, isoxicam and L arginine, in aqueous methanol at the boiling point of the solvent. L arginine isoxicamate, when prepared by this method, is an anhydrous, crystalline salt of 1 1 stoichiometry. It is a fine yellow crystalline powder with a water solubility of 19 mg per ml a saturated solution exhibiting a pH of about 8. In order to use the compound of the invention, it may be formulated into oral dosage forms such as capsules, tablets, or syrups by blending with an appropriate inert pharmaceutical carrier such as cellulose, lactose, or simple syrup by methods well known to the pharmaceutical art. For injectionable dosage forms, it may be formulated with vehicles such as water.The compound of the invention may also be formulated in topical preparations. The L arginine salt of isoxicam exhibits greater and more consistent bioavailability when orally administered than other known forms of isoxicam. Thus, for example, when compared to micronized isoxicam, L arginine isoxicamate affords a significant improvement in bioavailability on oral adminsitration. Isoxicam plasma concentrations and bioavailability parameters in four dogs after a single 100 mg oral dose of the arginine salt or the free acid are shown in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. Reference will now be made, by way of example only, to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a line drawing showing the mean plasma time course of four beagle dogs after a single oral dose of 100 mg free acid equivalents of isoxicam Figure 2 is a line drawing plotting plasma concentrations versus time profile of isoxicam after a single oral dose of 100 mg free acid equivalents to Beagle Dog 120,642 Figure 3 is a line drawing plotting plasma concentrations versus time profile of isoxicam after a single oral dose of 100 mg free acid equivalents to Beagle Dog 117,668 Figure 4 is a lint drawing plotting plasma concentration versus time profile of isoxicam after a single oral dose of 100 mg free acid equivalents to beagle Dog 1930 and Figure 5 is a line drawing plotting plasma concentration versus time profile of isoxicam after a single oral dose of 100 mg free acid equivalents to Beagle Dog 1942. Following a 120 trig free acid equivalents per oral dose of the arginine salt of isoxicam a mean peak plasma concentration of 53.9 i 4.0 g ml was reached at two hours postdose. The range for the individual animals was 51.4 to 63.0 ug ml with three animals having a peak time of two hours and the final animal at eight hours. These plasma levels were considerably higher when compared to micronized isoxicam. A mean peak plasma concentration of 14.8 4.9 bg ml was observed at four hours postdose for micronized isoxicam. Peak plasma concentrations for individual animals ranged from 9.92 to 19.0 19.0 pg ml between three and six hours postdose.Mean plasma concentrations proceeded to decline to the last sampling period of 240 hours where 0.82 0.3 pg ml was observed for arginine isoxicamate but were not detectable for micronized isoxicam. Calculated elimination half lives using a linear regression analysis of the semilogarithmic data are shown in Table 2. Mean half lives of 36.2 7.5 hours and 35.5 7.1 hours were found for arginine isoxicamate and micronized isoxicam. Mean Cmax values were dissimilar with a value of 56.2 5.6 g ml observed for arginine isoxicamate and 15.4 4.2 g ml for micronized isoxicam. A graphical presentation of the mean plasma concentration timeProfile is shown in Figure 1. Individual animal data are presented in Figures 2 5. Areas under the plasma concentration versus time curve AUC0 were calculated using the trapezoidal rule and extrapolated to infinity with the appropriate elimination rate constants. In every case, the AUC0 for arginine isoxicamate was greater than micronized isoxicam. The mean AUCO for arginine isoxicamate and isoxicam were 2840 170 ug.hr.ml1 and 808 230 vg.hr.ml l, respectively. The relative bioavailability of L arginine isoxicamate was determined from a comparison of the individual dog AUC0 arginine salt AUC0 micronized isoxicam. The relative bioavailability in the four dogs was calculated to be 539, 278, 368, and 313. The mean relative bioavailability arginine isoxicamate micronized isoxicam of arginine isoxicamate was determined to be 374 t 116 .These data are summarized in Table 2.
