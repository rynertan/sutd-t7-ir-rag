# Production of aromatic polyketones.

## Abstract
Production of an aromatic polyketone by reacting in the presence of a quinquevalent phosphorus halide preferably PCI₅ and a fluoroalkane sulphonic acid preferably CF₃SO₂OH the reactants selected from a a mixture of i at least one aromatic dicarboxylic acid HO₂C Ar CO₂H where Ar is a divalent aromatic radical and CO₂H is an aromatically bound carboxylic acid group, which dicarboxy lic acid is polymerisable with the at least one aromatic compound of ii , and ii at least one aromatic compound H Ar H where Ar is a divalent aromatic radial and H is an aromatically bound hydrogen atom, which compound is polymerisable with the at least one dicarboxylic acid of i b at least one aromatic monocarboxylic acid H Ar CO₂H where Ar is a divalent aromatic radical and H and CO₂H are as defined in a , which monocarboxylic acid is self polymerisable and c a combination of a and b .
