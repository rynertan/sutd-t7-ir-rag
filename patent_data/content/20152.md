# Anchor shank.

## Abstract
A shank 1 is provided for an anchor 2 , which is in the form of a longitudinally extending double plate 4, 5 girder with a transverse element 6, 7, 8 joining the double plates. In accordance with the present invention, the transverse element is substantially spaced from the cable attachment end of the shank and is orientated with a positive attack angle so that the element can contribute to the burial force developed by the anchor. The above double plate girder shank on the one hand provides increased resistance to bending moments in vertical and sideways directions and on the other hand enables satisfactory soil penetration by the shank due to the open construction. A plurality of the above transverse elements are preferably provided and form with the double plates passages diverging aft. The double plate shank can be removably attached to the fluke.
