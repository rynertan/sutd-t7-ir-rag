# Automatic object dispenser using screw driven mobile trays.

## Abstract
The object of this description is a very compact item dispenser having a vertical screw shaft on the thread of which rest the edges of trays, whose function it is to support the items to be dispensed. The rotation of this screw shaft causes a vertical displacement of the said trays so that they move from a supply point to a retrieval point. The trays can be recovered, to be used again in the dispenser and a storage area is provided for this purpose, where the empty trays are accumulated after the item they carried had been taken off.
