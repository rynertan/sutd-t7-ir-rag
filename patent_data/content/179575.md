# Apparatus for producing labels.

## Abstract
Apparatus for producing a succession of self adhesive labels 6 carried on a backing of release material 11 , the apparatus comprising means for conveying along a pathway a laminar material 10 comprising a web 16 coated on its reverse side with a pressure sensitive material and having a backing 11 of a release material detecting means 24, 26 situated along the pathway for detecting a succession of the particular locations which are spaced along the length of the laminar material 10 an adhesive applying station 28 situated along the pathway and including an adhesive applicator 30 , which is operable in response to the means for detecting 24, 26 , for applying a layer of adhesive to a succession of particular areas along the length of the web 16 a label applying station 27 situated along the pathway downstream of the adhesive applying station 28 , the label applying station 22 including label applying means 52 for successively applying individual pre printed labels 34 to respective successive areas of adhesive so that a pre printed label 34 covers each area of the web 16 to which adhesive has been applied, the label applying means 52 being operable in response to the means for detecting 24, 26 and a cutting station 12 which is situated along the pathway either upstream or downstream of the label applying station 22 , the cutting station 12 including a cutter 14 for cutting through either all of the layers of the laminar material 10 other than the backing 11 or, when the cutting station 12 is downstream of the label applying station 22 , all of those said layers and the pre printed labels 34 , so as to cut, respective ly, either a succession of spaced label portions to which respective pre printed labels 34 are subsequently applied at the label applying station 22 or a succession of labels 6 , on the backing 10 .
