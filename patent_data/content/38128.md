## Description
ELECTRO HYDRAULIC SERVO ACTUATOR SYSTEM This invention relates in general to hydraulic systems, and in particular, to a hydraulic system having an improved solenoid actuated pilot spool valve. A typical electro hydraulic servo system will include a main spool valve for controlling the direction and quantity of fluid from a source of pressurized fluid, such as a pump, to a fluid actuator, such as a motor. A pilot valve is used to control the position of the main spool by selectively directing fluid from another pressurized source to the ends of the main spool. The pilot valve is itself a spool valve, whose spool position is determined by a force motor, such as a solenoid, acting on one end of the pilot spool in order to control the fluid directed to the ends of the main spool. Linear solenoids are designed to generate a near constant force over the entire distance that the plunger armature travels. In anther words, linear solenoids exert a constant force as the solenoid air gap changes. The pilot spool is held in a central or neutral position by relatively light balance springs disposed on opposite ends of the pilot spool. When a solenoid acts on the pilot spool to displace it from its neutral position, a solenoid force is applied to one end of the spool. As the spool moves, it compresses a balance spring until the spring generates an equal and opposite spring force to counteract the solenoid force. Examples of such systems may be found in U.S. Patents Nos. 4,031,813 3,874,269 and 3,763,746. Although a solenoid is an inherently nonlinear apparatus, one can be modified to operate over a linear range see, e.g. U.S. Patent No. 3,740,594.Linearly operating solenoids have been used to control pilot spools because such solenoids exert a near constant force over the full length of their air gap for a given electrical input. Thus, in theory, a linear solenoid should yield a one for one correspondence between the operator input an electrical signal , the displacement of the pilot spool which is resisted by a spring with a linear spring constant , and the resulting displacement of the main spool and the motor. Unfortunately, such systems do not achieve their desired results. We have observed that such systems will inherently suffer from a reduction in volume of fluid transferred through the pilot spool and in a slower response time. The latter phenomena are believed to be caused by a third, non linear force which acts against the solenoid force. The source of this third force is believed to be the fluid itself.This force, sometimes referred to as a Bernoulli force, arises from the flow of fluid through the chambers of thu pilot spool and acts on the spool to oppose its displacement. The dynamic or Bernoulli force thus opposes the constant force of the linear solenoid, thereby negating the overall desired result of one for one correlation between input and output. Contrary to the traditional use of linear solenoids, we have discovered that a non linear solenoid whose actuating force increases as the air gap decreases will more effectively counteract the dynamic, Bernoulli forces and thereby yield an overall linear result.Accordingly, a main feature of the present invention is the use of a solenoid having exaggerated, non linear characteristics for acting upon a pilot spool. Such non linear characteristics are usually present for example in solenoids having sloped or slanted pole faces which are known per se, rather than the flat pole faces of linear solenoids. With the non linearBernoulli forces counteracted by the non linear solenoid forces, the overall system achieves the desired linear response. Hence, the combination of a pilot spool valve with a non linear solenoid overcomes the aforementioned problems associated with earlier pilot spool and linear solenoid combinations. In order that the invention may be clearly understood, exemplary embodiments thereof will hereinafter be described with reference to the accompanying drawings wherein Figure 1 is a schematic representation of a pilot operated hydraulic directional control valve system Figure 2 is an enlarged view of the solenoid operated pilot valve of Figure 1 Figures 3 and 4 are graphical representations of the forces acting upon a pilot spool and Figure 5 is an electrical schematic representation of a circuit for energizing the coils of the solenoid actuator of Figure 2. In Figure 1 there is shown an electrohydraulic serso actuated system 10 That system includes a fluid motor, such as the cylinder 11 with a differential piston 12 which can be translated in either direction by selective application of fluid pressure and flow via service lines 13 and 14. The direction and quantity of fluid applied to service lines 13 and 14 is controlled by main spool valve 15.Hydraulic fluid is drawn from a reservoir 19 and is pressurized by a pump 16 that is in turn connected to spool valve inlet line 17. An outlet line 18 carries fluid away from the spool valve 15. A pressure relief valve 9 is connected between lines 17 and 18 in a manner well known in the art. Main spool valve 15 operates in a conventional manner. To this end, when the spool valve is displaced to the right, service line 13 is connected with inlet 17 thereby displacing the piston 12 to the right.Likewise, fluid is exhausted from cylinder 11 via the service line 14 which is connected to drain or outlet 18. In a similar manner, the piston 12 can be driven in the opposite direction when spool valve 15 is shifted to the left. The position of main spool valve 15 is hydraulically controlled by a pilot spool servo actuator system 20. Pilot service lines 21, 22 connect the ends of the main spool valve 15 with the pilot servo actuator system 20. Accordingly, main spool valve 15 is shifted to the left or the right depending upon the fluid pressure and flow applied via service lines 21, 22 which act against the centering springs 5 and 6 of the main spool. The pilot actuator system 20 includes a pilot spool valve 24 which controls the direction and quantity of pilot fluid supplied via pilot lines 21 and 22. The position of pilot spool 24 is itself determined by a centering spring 23 and a solenoid actuated force motor 25. Pilot fluid is drawn from the same reservoir 19 and is pressurized by a pilot pump 26 that is connected to pilot inlet line 27. A pilot outlet line 29 is provided for exhausting return fluid through the pilot valves 24 to the reservoir 19. A pilot relief valve 28 is connected between the inlet and outlet lines 27, 29 for relieving excessive pilot pressure in a manner well known in the art. Turning now to Figure 2, there is shown an enlarged cross sectional view of the pilot actuatr system 20. As can be seen, the pilot spool valve 24 includes a housing 30 having a cylindrical bore 35 with a cylindrical spool 31 slidably mounted therein. A plurality of raised lands 32, 33, 34 on spool 31 are provided for controlling the direction of fluid from the inlet line 27 to the pilot service line ports 21a and 22a in a per se known manner. The solenoid force motor 25 includes a ferromagnetic housing 40. The housing includes an armature cavity 37 having a pair of oppositely disposed conical pole faces 38, 39. An armature 42 is reciprocally and slidably mounted within the cavity 39. Armature 42 has a central cylindrical body portion and two oppositely disposed, conically shaped end faces 48, 49 that face pole faces 38, 39, respectively. A pair of electromagnetic coils 44, 45 are enclosed in the housing 40, closely adjacent to the armature 42. The coils 44, 45 are separated near the middle of cavity 37 by an insulating disc 46. The armature 42 will be urged towards the left when coil 44 is energized and teethe right when coil 45 is energized. Electrical energy is supplied to the respective coils 44, 45 by a pair of leads 54, 55 see Figure 1 . An actuator rod 41 axially punted on The armature 42 extends from the force motor housing 40 through the pilot spool housing 34 to engage one end of pilot spool 31. Accordingly, the position of the armature 42 and thus the pilot spool 31 will be determined upon the net electromechanical force exerted on the armature 42 via the coils 44, 45. The energizing circuit for coils 44 and 45 is schematically shown in Figure 5. There, a supply voltage V is applied across a rheostat 51 and a parallel combination of three series resistors, R1, R2, and R3. The output of rheostat 51 is applied to an oscillator 56 whose output is in turn a saw tooth shaped voltage signal whose amplitude is representative of the voltage drop between the wiper arm 51a of the rheostat and the ground. The oscillator signal is applied to a comparator 57. The comparator 57 will compare the input oscillator voltage with two fixed voltages, i.e., the voltages between resistors R1 R2 and R2 R3. As a result, the output of the comparator 57 will be a modulated triangular pulse signal whose amplitude is representative of the relative displacement of the rheostat arm 51a from its mid or null point.The comparator output is applied to a pair of pulse width modulating amplifiers 58, 59 whose outputs yield pulse width modulated current signals which are respectively proportional to the relative position of the wiper arm of rheostat 51. Hence, when rheostat 51 is set in its center or null position, the signals imposed upon coil lead 47, 48 will have the same relative width and hence the armature42 will be held in its central or neutral position. However, as the wiper arm is moved away from its null position, the relative width of the current pulse signals appearing on the respective lines 47, 48 will change and the armature will be moved in the general direction of the larger pulse width signal. The interaction between the spring, solenoid, and dynamic forces is best explained with reference to Figures 3 and 4. When the force motor 25 is actuated either to the left or to the right, it applies a solenoid force designated Fs on to the pilot spool 31.That force Fs is opposed by two forces which act upon a pilot spool 31 in a direction opposite to the solenoid force. These two opposing forces include the spring force Fk exerted on the spool by centering spring 23 and a fluid dynamic force, Fd, otherwi e known as a Bernoulli force. The latter is so designated because Bernoulli was the first to explain how the passage of a fluid through a variable restricted orifice generated opposing forces upon the means used to constrict the orifice. Such Bernoulli forces are non linear and are generally represented by the graphical presentation shown in Figure 4. There it will be seen that the Bernoulli forces Fd will generally reach peak Fd max after which they will fall off. In the case of a pilot spool, the Bernoulli forces can be related to the spool displacement which is the cause of the restriction of the fluid. Hence, it can be said that the Bernoulli forces will reach a maximum Fd max. at a given spool displacement, in this case, d max. We have discovered that such Bernoulli forces can be counterbalanced by a non linear solenoid which increases its applied force at a rate similar to the Bernoulli forces as the air gap of the solenoid decreases. We have chosen to use a solenoid with conical pole forces 38, 39 and a conical ended armature 42 in order to emphasize the non linearity of the force applied by the solenoid as the armature 42 approaches either of the opposite pole faces 38, 39.The conical pole faces 38, 39 serve to concentrate the magnetic field at the end of the air gap, thereby exerting an increasing force on armature 42 as it moves toward one of the pole faces 38, 39. The length of air gap d on the solenoid is chosen to match the spool displacement which will encounter the maximum Bernoulli forces. As the fluid dynamic forces Fd increase with the spool displacement, the solenoid forces increase in a proportionate amount thereby cancelling one another out and leaving a net force at Fn which approximates a desired linear response. Accordingly, the displacement of the pilot spool, and ultimately, of the main spool itself, is directly proportional to the position of the wiper arm of rheostat 51. As the wiper arm is moved 10 percent from its null position, the pilot spool will move 10 percent from its null position and thereby displace the main spool 10 percent from its null position. Such a true, overall linear correlation between an input signal and the output displacement of the main spool has not been possible with the usual linear solenoid force motor. Such force motors generally apply a constant force across the whole air gap. So, as the Bernoulli forces increase with the spool displacement, the linear solenoid maintains a constant force and the net force applied to the pilot spool decreases. Of course, to counteract the opposingBernoulli forces, an operator could increase the powder supplied to the coils 44, 45 by adjusting the position of the rheostat 51. As a result, an operator might have to move the rheostat 30 percent of its dis placement in order to achieve a 10 percent displacement of the main spool. Hence, in operation, an operator was required to overshoot the rheostat adjustment in order to achieve the desired displacement for the main spool. However, with the present invention, an operator can now achieve the desired one for one correlation between the rheostat position and the displacement of the main spool 15. Thus, the invention will provide for greater precision in both the manual and the automatic operation of electro hydraulic servo systems.
