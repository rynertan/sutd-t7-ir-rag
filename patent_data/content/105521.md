## Description
Novel DNA, Microorganism Transformed Therewith and Use Thereof This invention relates to a novel DNA. More particularly, this invention relates to a promoter for gene expression. Advances in gene manipulation technique have led researchers to attempt the production of various substances on a large scale and at a low cost, which can hardly be in large amount from natural sources, by causing microorganisms to produce such substances as gene products. In this case, the amount of gene product by microorganisms largely depends on the activity of a promoter which lies upstream from a relevant structural gene. Thus, the promoter controls the gene transcription and therefore, for increasing the gene product productivity, it is very important to search for a potent promoter for use in the production of various gene products. Typical promoters so far used for gene expression are tryptophan trp promoter, APL promoter and lactose lac promoter, among others. On the other hand, the Escherichia coli rec A promoter is a promoter which controls the synthesis of the rec A gene product. The rec A gene plays a main role in the so called SOS response Witkin, E. M., Bacteriol.Reviews, 40, 869 1976 1 which involves the induced synthesis of its product and the repair of damaged DNA upon damage of DNA in cells or upon inhibition of replication. Its product rec A protein has a proteolytic activity. Since the lex A gene product acts as the rec A gene repressor, the expression of the rec A gene is normally suppressed. However, a DNA damaging treatment e.g. UV irradiation, nalidixic acid treatment, mitomycin treatment strongly induces the synthesis of the rec A protein. This indicates that the rec A promoter is activated by such treatment. Therefore, if a peptideencoding nucleotide is inserted downstream from the rec A promoter, the synthesis of its product can be controlled by the above treatment. Such is a very advantageous property for the production of a peptide.Another characteristic feature of the rec A promoter consists in that the promoter activity is very strong. The base sequence of the rec A promoter has already been reported lHorii, T. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.U.S.A., 77, 313 1980 Sancar, A. et al., ibid., 77, 2611 1980 1. However, there is no adequate restriction enzyme cleavage site downstream from the rec A promoter.Accordingly, it is difficult to insert, downstream from this promoter as it is, a peptide encoding nucleotide.Since there is no restriction enzyme recognition site immediately following the rec A promoter, the ligation of a peptide encoding aucleQtidedownstream therefrom results in the production of a chimera peptide of the rec A protein with the structural gene product. Therefore, no positive attempt to make use of the rec A promoter in gene expression has so far been reported. The present inventors prepared the rec A promoter and introduced various restriction enzyme recognition sites on both ends thereof, and succeeded in reconstructing a promoter suitable for direct expression of an intended peptideencoding nucleotide inserted downstream therefrom, not in the form of a chimera peptide between the rec A protein and the polypeptide. Thus, the present invention provides a DNA which contains one or more rec A promoters, at the 3 end of the promoter or promoters no translational start codon ATG being directly linked, a transformant containing said DNA and a method of producing a peptide by cultivation of a transformant which contains a DNA containing one or more rec A promoters, at the 3 end of the rec A promoter or promoters no translational start codon ATG being directly linked, and containing downstream from the rec A promoter or promoters a peptide encoding nucleotide beginning with a translational start codon other than the rec A structural gene. In the present specification, claims and drawings, the DNA having the nucleotide sequence as shown in Figure hereinafter referred to as Fig.Y lies referred to as rec A promoter for convenience sake. The symbols as used in the present specification, claims and drawings each has the meaning given in Table 1. Table 1 DNA deoxyribonucleic acid A deoxyadenylate T deoxythymidylate G deoxyguanylate C deoxycytidylate RNA ribonucleic acid dATP deoxyadenosine triphosphate dTTP deoxythymidine triphosphate dGTP deoxyguanosine triphosphate dCTP deoxycytidine triphosphate ATP adenosine triphosphate EDTA ethylenediamine tetraacetate b base s bp base pair s kbp kilobase pairs kb kilobases Apcr ampicillin resistance Tetr tetracycline resistance recAp rec A promoter The rec A promoter reconstruction and the expression plasmid construction are performed, for example in the following manner. Double digestion of the plasmid pMCR611 DNA Miki, T. et al., Mol. Gen. Genet., 183, 25 1981 with the restriction enzymes BamHI and PstI gives a 1.25 Kb DNA fragment containing the rec A promoter. Digestion of said fragment with the restriction enzyme HaeIII gives a 300 bDNA fragment containing the rec A promoter. Further digestion of this 300 b DNA fragment with the restriction enzyme HpaII gives a 148 b DNA fragment covering, according to the report of Sancar et al. vide supra , the sequence from 129 to 19 with the RNA transcription startpoint on the rec A promoter being counted as 1. The SD sequence of the rec A promoter is missing in said DNA fragment. Separately, oligonucleotides dCGGTATTACCCGGC, dATGACAGGAGTAAAAG, dTCATGCCGGGTAATAC, dGATCCTTTTACTCCTG are chemically synthesized for example by the phosphotriester method tcrea, R. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.U.S.A., 75, 5765 1978 1. These are ligated together, for example with T4 DNA ligase. The thus obtained 30 bDNA fragment is joined to the above 148 b DNA, for example with T4 DNA ligase, to give a 178 b DNA fragment. The cohesive termini on both ends of this DNA are filled in, for example with DNA polymerase I large fragment and then the BamHI linker dCCGGATCCGG is joined to said DNA using T4 DNA ligase. The resulting DNA fragment is digested with the restriction enzyme BamHI and then inserted into the plasmid pBR322 digested with BamHI with the use of T4 DNA ligase. In this way, there can be constructed a recombinant plasmid, pREC3, which contains the rec A promoter possessing BamHI recognition sites on the ends thereof.An expression plasmid, pREC33, which possesses a BamHI site only downstream from the rec A promoter, can also be constructed by eliminating anotherBamHI site, which lies upstream from the rec A promoter, from said pREC3, for example by a series of operational steps, for example, partial digestion of pREC3 with BamHI, repair of the cohesive termini with DNA polymerase I large fragment and rejoining with T4 DNA ligase. It is also possible to cut out the rec A promoter of pREC3 with the restriction enzyme BamHI, render the cohesive termini on both ends blunt with S1 nuclease,DNA polymerase I large fragment or the like and join thereto the EcoRI, ClaI or HindIII linker, for instance, whereby a DNA possessing a restriction enzyme recognition site suitable for the insertion of a variety of peptideencoding nucleotides into said site can be introduced into the promoter at the end thereof. In this case, the number of bases as a space inclusive of linker between the rec A promoter and a translational start codon is 1 to 20, more preferably 3 to 15 and most preferably 6 to 13. Furthermore, it is possible to cut out, with a restriction enzyme, the rec A promoter of pREC3 or corresponding plasmids with the various recognition sites as described above, to ligate molecules of the cut out promoter with each other with T4 DNA ligase and to insert the thus obtained successive dimer, trimer, etc. into the plasmid pBR322, whereby an expression plasmid having still more potent promoter activity can be obtained. Further, the expression plasmid may contains, in addition, such a promoter as bla, tufB and lpp promoter. Any nucleotide coding for a peptide e.g. human immunoglobulin E H chain polypeptide, hepatitis B virus surface antigen, human growth hormone, somatostatin can be inserted, with the aid of a restriction enzyme and T4DNA ligase, into the expression vector constructed in the above manner. The above expression plasmid or a recombinant DNA obtained by insertion of an optionally selected peptideencoding nucleotide there into can be introduced into an adequate host organism. The host organism includes microorganisms such as Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and yeasts. Preferred are strains of Escherichia coli strains 294, W3110, RR1, DM511, DM1187, etc. , in particular strain 294. The DM511 strain containing mutation in the lex A gene which is the repressor against the rec A promoter mount, D. W. et al., J. Bacteriol., 116, 950 1973 and the DM1187 strain Mount, D. W. et al.,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 74, 300 1977 are also suitable for the development of activity by the present promoter. The transformation of a host organism with the above recombinant DNA can be carried out by the known method Cohen, S. N. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 69, 2110 1972 1 or a modification thereof. Thus, for instance, Escherichia coli strain 294 can be transformed by introduction thereinto of the recombinant plasmid DNA obtained in the above manner. An adequate transformant can be selected with the ampicillin or tetracycline resistance as the indicator. The strain 294 is a known strain Backman, K. et awl., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 73, 4174 1976 . It has also been deposited with theInstitute for Fermentation, Osaka under No. IFO 14171. The thus selected transformant is cultivated in a per se known medium. As the medium, there may be mentionedL broth and glucose and casamino acids containing M 9 medium, among others. For efficient functioning of the promoter, such an agent as nalidixic acid and mitomycin C may be added as necessary. The cultivation is conducted generally at 150 to 430C, preferably 280 to 420C, for 2 to 24 hours, preferably 4 to 16 hours. Aeration and or stirring may be made as necessary. After cultivation of the above transformant, cells are harvested by the known method, then suspended for example in a buffer solution, and destructed for example by treatment with lysozyme, a surface active agent or ultrasonic waves. The supernatant is collected by centrifugation. The isolation of the peptide from said supernatant may be effected by following the generally known protein purification method. In this manner, the desired peptide itself can be obtained directly, not in the form of a chimera peptide between the rec A protein and the peptide. Furthermore, it is possible to insert the rec A promoter into an optionally selected plasmid upstream from, for example, the ampicillin resistance gene gene coding for B lactamase in the same orientation as said gene, whereby the promoter activity can be measured with the increased ss lactamase activity as the indicator.The ss lactamase activity can be determined, for example by using cephaloridine as the substrate, adding a cell suspension thereto and determining the decomposition of cephaloridine in terms of a decrease in absorbance at 260 nm Ross and O Callaghan, Methods in Enz., 43, 69 1975 1.

Fig. 2 shows the construction scheme for pREC3 and Fig. 3 shows the construction scheme for pREC33, pREC206, pREC207, pREC103, pREC113, pREC114 and pREC136.

The portion indicated by t represents the human IgE Hchain polypeptide encoding DNA fragment. The following examples are given for further illustration of the present invention. It is to be noted that they are by no means limitative of the present invention. Example 1 Preparation of rec A promoter containing DNA fragment cf. Fig. 2 The plasmid pMCR6ll t300 ug vide supra was digested with the restriction enzymes BamHI and PstI Takara Shuzo . Agarose gel 1 electrophoresis gave a 1.25 kbp DNA fragment containing the rec A promoter portion, which fragment was eluted from the gel McDonell, M. W.et al., J. Mol. Biol., 110, 119 1977 . This DNA fragment was purified by phenol extraction, ether extraction and ethanol precipitation, then digested with the restriction enzyme HaeIII Takara Shuzo , and fractionated by 1.5 agarose gel electrophoresis to give a 300 b DNA fragment containing the rec A promoter portion.The fragment was purified in the same manner as mentioned above. This DNA fragment was further digested with the restriction enzyme HpaII Takara Shuzo . The digestion product was subjected to 8 acrylamide gel acrylamide bisacrylamide 19 1 electrophoresis so as to isolate the 148 b DNA fragment covering the sequence from 129 to 19 with the PNA transcription startpoint on the rec A promoter being counted as 1 as reported by Sancar et al. Cvide supra . The thus fractionated fragment was purified in the same manner as above. Separately, four oligonucleotides each containing a portion of the 31 end of the rec A promoter, namely 1 dCGGTATTACCCGGC, 2 dATGACAGGAGTAAAAG, 3 dTCATGCCGGGTAATAC and 4 dGATCCTTTTACTCCTG, were chemically synthesized by the phosphotriester method vide supra .

Equal amounts 0.5 pg of the four oligonucleotides, namely oligonucleotides 1 and 4 and 5 phosphorylated oligonucleotides 2 and 3 , were mixed and, using T4 DNA ligase, they were ligated to one another by maintaining the mixture in 50 pl of reaction medium 66 mM Tris HC1, pH 7.6, 6.6 mM MgC12, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM ATP, 300 units T4 DNA ligase at 140C for 16 hours.The reaction product was fractionated by 10 acrylamide gel acrylamide bisacrylamide 19 1 electrophoresis. The 30 b DNA fragment, a ligation product of the oligonucleotides, was isolated and purified in the same manner as mentioned above. In the next place, the above mentioned 148 b DNA fragment and the 30 b DNA fragment were ligated together using T4 DNA ligase. The reaction product was fractionated by 8 acrylamide gel electrophoresis. The 178 b DNA fragment which thus formed was isolated and purified.The cohesive termini of this DNA fragment were rendered blunt by contacting the DNA fragment with DNA polymeraseI large fragment Bethesda Research Laboratories BRL in 30 p1 of reaction mixture 40 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 6.6 mM MgCl2, 1 mM 2 mercaptoethanol, 20 pM dATP, 20 uM dGTP, 20 pM dCTP, 20 pM dTTP, 2 unitsDNA polymerase I large fragment at 200C for 30 minutes.The product DNA was purified by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation and thereto was joined.. the BamHI linker dCCGGATCCGG BRL phosphorylated at the 5 end, using T4 DNA ligase. The product was digested with the restriction enzyme BamHI and inserted into the pBR322 DNABamHI digestion product. The resultant recombinant DNA was used for transformation of Escherichia coli strain 294. Ampicillin resistant, tetracycline sensitive transformants were selected and plasmid DNAs were isolated therefrom according to the method of Birnboim Doly iNucleic Acids Res., 7, 1513 1973 . A plasmid which gave a 185 b DNA fragment upon digestion with the restriction enzyme BamHI was selected. At the same time, the base sequence of the 185 b DNA fragment thus cut out was determined according to the dideoxynucleotide synthetic chain termination method Nucleic Acids Res., 9, 309 1981 . In this manner, there was obtained the product of ligation of the 148 b DNA fragment from the 5 end portion of the rec A promoter with the BamHI linker as joined together in the expected manner.

A pBR322 plasmid with this DNA fragment inserted therein withthesame orientation of the rec A promoter with that of the ampicillin resistance offering ss lactamase gene was named pREC3. Example 2 Construction of rec A promoter containing expression vector cf. Fig. 3 i Expression vector with restriction enzyme BamHI recognition site as a site for insertion. The expression vector plasmid pREC3 containing the site for insertion atthe restriction enzyme BamHI recognition site was partially digested with the restriction enzyme BamHI.The resultant cohesive termini of the plasmid DNA cleaved at one site of the plasmid were rendered blunt according to the method described in Example 1 using DNA polymeraseI large fragment and rejoined together using T4 DNA ligase. The resultant DNA was used for transformation of Escherichia coli strain 294. Ampicillin resistant transformants were selected, and plasmid DNAs were isolated therefrom according to the method of Birnboim Doly alkali extraction method . A plasmid in which the BamHI site on the 5 end upstream of the rec A promoter was eliminated from the restriction enzyme cleavage pattern was selected Åand named pREC33. ii Expression vector with restriction enzyme ClaI recognition site as a site for insertion. The plasmid pREC3 was digested with the restriction enzyme BamHI, followed by 6 acrylamide gel electrophoresis, which gave a 185 b rec A promoter unit DNA. The cohesive termini of this DNA were rendered blunt with S1 nuclease BRL in 100 ul of reaction mixture 0.5 ug DNA, 0.03 M sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5, 0.3 M Nail, 4.5 mM Zinc12, 3 units S1 nuclease at 220C for 30 minutes and then theDNA was purified by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. The ClaI linker dCATCGATG chemically synthesized by the phosphotriester method was phosphorylated at the 5 end and ligated with the above DNA using T4DNA ligase.The ligation product was digested with the restriction enzyme ClaI Boehringer and ligated with the pBR322 DNA digested with the same enzyme. The ligation product was used for transformation of Escherichia coli strain 294. Ampicillin resistant transformants were selected. Plasmid DNAs were isolated from these transformants according to the method of Birnboim Doly vide supra . Based on the restriction enzyme cleavage pattern, a plasmid pREC103 containing the rec A promoter in the same orientation as that of the 6 lactamase gene and a plasmid pREC113 containing the rec A promoter in the opposite orientation to the S lactamase gene were selected.In pREC113, the rec A promoter is directed toward the tetracycline resistance gene, so that the transformant carrying this plasmid is partially resistant to tetracycline. pREC103 and pREC113 were partially cleaved with the restriction enzyme ClaI and, following the procedure ofExample 2 i , plasmids with the ClaI recognition site on the 5 end side of upstream from the rec A promoter eliminated were selected and named pREC144 and pREC136, respectively. iii Expression vector with restriction enzyme EcoRI recognition site as a site for insertion The plasmid pREC3 was digested with the restriction enzyme BamHI and, following the procedure of Example 2 ii , a rec A promoter unit DNA was isolated and rendered blunt ended. This DNA was ligated with the EcoRI linker dGGAATTCC BRL phosphorylated at the 5 end, using T4DNA ligase, followed by digestion with the restriction enzyme EcoRI Takara Shuzo and ligation with the pBR322DNA digested with the same enzyme using T4 DNA ligase. The ligation product was used for transformation of Escherichia coli strain 294, and ampicillin and tetracyclineresistant transformants were selected.Plasmid DNAs were isolated from these transformants according to the method of Birnboim Doly vide supra and, based on the restriction enzyme cleavage pattern, a plasmid pREC206 with the recA promoter in the same orientation as the 6 lactamase gene and one pREC207 with the rec A promoter in the opposite orientation to said gene were selected. Example 3 Construction of expression vector with successive recA promoters cf. Fig. 4 The plasmid pREC144 constructed in Example 2 was double digested with the restriction enzymes ClaI andPstI, followed by 1.2 agarose gel electrophoresis. Then, a 3.8 kbp DNA fragment containing the rec A promoter portion was isolated and purified according to the same method as described in Example 1. The plasmid pREC103 constructed in Example 2 was separately digested with the restriction enzyme PstI and further digested partially with the restriction enzymeClaI, and a 0.96 kbp DNA fragment containing the rec A promoter portion was isolated according to the abovementioned method. This fragment was ligated with the above mentioned 3.8 kbp DNA fragment with T4 DNA ligase to give an expression plasmid, pREC2102, with two successive rec A promoters. With this plasmid, a gene desired to be expressed can be inserted thereinto at the ClaI recognition site. Separately, the plasmid pREC206 constructed inExample 2 was double digested with the restriction enzymesClaI and PstI, and a 0.96 kbp DNA fragment containing the rec A promoter portion was isolated according to the above mentioned method. This was ligated with the abovementioned 3.8 kbp DNA fragment using T4 DNA ligase to give an expression plasmid, pREC2201, containing two successive rec A promoters. with this plasmid, a gene desired to be expressed can be inserted there into at the EcoRI recognition site. Example 4 Assay of expression vectors for promoter activity Of the expression vectors constructed in Examples 2 and 3, those in which the orientation of the rec A promoter agrees with that of the ss lactamase gene i.e.pREC3, pREC33, pREC103, pREC144, pREC206, pREC2102 and pREC2201 can be assayed for the promoter activity using the B lactamase activity as the indicator. The ss lactamase activity can be determined by using cephaloridine as the substrate and measuring the decrease in absorbance at 260 nm which reflects the decomposition of cephaloridine. Thus, transformants of Escherichia coli strain 294 with the above expression plasmids were incubated in M 9 medium containing 1 glucose and 0.4 Casamino acids for 3 hours, then nalidixic acid was added to the concentration of 50 pg ml, and incubation was continued. Four hours after nalidixic acid addition, the culture broth was sampled and assayed for B lactamase by the above mentioned method For pREC144, the activity seven hours after nalidixic acid addition was also given by way of example. Cephaloridine was dissolved in 10 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.6, plus 1 mM EDTA in the concentration of 25 ug ml. To 3 ml of the solution, there was added 5 25 ul of the culture broth. After 15 seconds, 30 seconds and 1 minute of incubation at room temperature, decreases in absorbance at 260 nm were determined. The values obtained were converted to the decrease in absorbance at 260 nm in each minute per milliliter of medium, which were then averaged.The thus obtained mean values are shown graphically inFig. 5. As in seen Fig. 5, the addition of nalidixic acid strongly induced the rec A promoter activity of each expression plasmid as evidenced by the potentiation ofB lactamase activity for pREC144, about 70 times, seven hours after nalidxic acid addition Example 5 Construction of human immunoglobulin E H chain gene expression plasmid cf.Fig. 6 The plasmid pGETtrp302 with the human immunoglobulinE H chain gene inserted therein downstream from the tryptophan promoter described in Example 3 of European PatentApplication No. 83 108 699.6 filed on September 3, 1983, was used Escherichia coli 294 pGETtrp302 carrying the plasmid pGETtrp302 has been deposited with the Institute for Fermentation, Osaka undcr deposit No. IFo l4285.

This DNA was purified by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation and then ligated with the EcoRI linker dCTAGAATTCTAG chemically synthesized by the phosphotriester method and phosphorylated at the S end using T4 DNA ligase. The ligation product was doubledigested with the restriction enzymes EcoRI and PstI, and a 1.2 kb DNA fragment was isolated by the subsequent 1 agarose gel electrophoresis and purified according to the method described in Example 1. Separately, the plasmid pREC206 was digested with the restriction enzyme PstI and then further digested partially with the restriction enzyme EcoRI, the digestion product was subjected to 1 agarose gel electrophoresis, and a 3.8 kb DNA fragment was isolated and purified by the method described in Example 1.

Escherichia coli 294 pGETrec301 has been deposited with the Institute forFermentation, Osaka under deposit No. IFO 14287. Example 6 Expression of human immunoglobulin E H chain gene in Escherichia coli and isolation of human immunoglobulin E H chain polypeptide The transformant carrying the human immunoglobulinE H chain gene expression plasmid pGETrec301 as obtained in Example 5 was cultured in M 9 medium containing 1 glucose and 0.4 Casamino acids for 4 hours. Then, nalidixic acid was added in the concentration of 50 vg ml, and incubation was continued for further 4 hours. Thereafter cells were harvested and suspended in 1 50 volume of a solution containing 50 mM Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2 MNaC1, 0.01 M EDTA, 10 sucrose and 150 pg ml lysozyme.The suspension was allowed to stand at OOC for 50 minutes and then treated at 370C for 2 minutes. Thereafter the suspension was cooled back to 04C and, after addition of Q.18 of Triton X 100, subjected to sonication, followed by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm Servall, SS34 rotor for 3Q minutes.
