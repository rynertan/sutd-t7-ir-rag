# AIR FLOW GENERATING APPARATUS

## Abstract
The described air flow discharge generating apparatus generates an air stream by a corona discharge without a mechanically operating section and is used for an air cleaning apparatus or an air conditioner. This apparatus has a plurality of electrode plates arranged at a predetermined interval or hollow electrodes to form air flow passages, a number of ionizing wires arranged at positions in predeter mined distances from the ends of the electrodes, and rod shaped magnets attached to the ends of the respective electrodes. Since ions produced by a corona discharge are accelerated magnetically by the magnets, ion flow is acceler ated, thereby remarkably increasing the velocity and air pressure of the air stream generated.
