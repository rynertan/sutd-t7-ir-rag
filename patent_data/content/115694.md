# Compositions for producing on a substrate a temporary protective coating subsequently removable with aqueous alkali.

## Abstract
Aqueous compositions suitable for forming on a sub strata a temporary protective coating, which can subsequently be removed by treatment with an aqueous alkaline solution, comprise a sterically stabilised dispersion in an aqueous medi um of particles of size range 0.1 10 Âµm of a polymer derived from monomers including at least one acrylic monomer and from 5 to 40 , based on the total weight of monomers, of an ethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic acid, or an equiva lent proportion of an unsaturated polycarboxylic acid.
