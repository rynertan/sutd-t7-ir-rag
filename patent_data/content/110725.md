# Improvements in fluid pressure operated tools.

## Abstract
A tool 10 has a housing 11 , a reversible fluid pressure operated rotary motor 12 which is arranged to drive a bit holder 13 via reduction gear boxes 14 and 15 and a clutch 16 which is designed to slip at a predetermined torque. When a trigger 18 is pressed, pressure air is delivered via a valve 22 to the motor, and in a first position of the valve 22 the motor is driven in a forward direction. When the predetermined torque is reached, the clutch slips and displaces an actuator 69 which opens another valve 40 . This in turn creates a pressure differential across the valve 22 which causes it to move to its second position in which pressure air is delivered to the motor to drive it in the reverse direction. When the trigger is released, the valves return to their original positions.
