## Description
MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY PANEL FOR HISTOCOMPATIBILITY TYPING The major histocompatibility complex MHC in man is denoted HLA and is encoded by a series of linked loci located on the short arm of chromosome 6. Class I HLA antigens are encoded by the HLA A,B, and C loci while class II antigens are encoded by the HLA DR, DP and DQ loci. The HLA antigens are highly polymorphic, i.e., there is a large number of alleles at each locus.Because of this high degree of polymorphism, the determination of an individual s HLA type conventionally requires testing of that individual s cells with a large panel of antibodies to identify which two alleles are present at each locus. An individual s HLA type, then, is the sum of the alleles assigned for each locus. The HLA antigens are known to play a major role in the acceptance or rejection of cells or tissues transplanted between individuals Klein, Im munoloav The Science of Self Nonself Discrimination, John Wiley, New York, 1982 . The likelihood of acceptance of the transplanted cells or tissue is increased when the recipient and the donor shareHLA alleles. The transplantation of different tissues requires a different stringency of matching. For example. platelet transfusion requires less stringency.than bone marrow transplantation. The HLA antigens are also known to piay a role in disease susceptibility. The presence of particular alleles results in a predisposition to certain diseases. For example. the presence of the B27 allele is so strongly correlated with ankylosing spondylitis as to be useful in the differential diagnosis of this disease. The high degree of polymorphism of the HLA antigens also makes them particularly useful for paternity testing. HLA polymorphisms have been largely defined by complement dependent cytotoxicity assays, using sera from multiparous women. These sera have a number of limitations. They are often weak and multispecific, and those directed to some of the rarer polymorphisms are difficult to find. Thus it is necessary to screen large numbers of sera in order to find one or a few which are useful. Furthermore, because of the comparatively small volumes usuaily available, it is necessary to continually replace these sera with new sera which must be standardized and checked against the previous ones. Deliberate immunization of human volunteers for the purpose of producing alloantisera has proved useful, but has obvious practical and ethical limitations. In view of these problems, several attempts have been made to produce xenogeneic antisera recognizing HLA polymorphisms. However, such xenoantisera have been found to contain predominantly antibodies to species specific determinants hence extensive absorption is required to detect antibodies to polymorphic determinants Staines et al., Tissue Antiaens 1973 3 1 Goodfellow et al., ibid 1976 7 105 .Some success in raising antisera which recognize polymorphisms has been achieved by using the combined strategies of immunizing with purified material and immunizing species which are closely related evolutionarily Barnstable et al., Cell 1979 14 9 Sanderson et al ., TransDlantation 1973 16 304 .Nonetheless, extensive absorptions are still usually required to remove the non polymorphic activity of these antisera. With the advent of the hybridoma technique of Kohler and Milstein, Nature 1975 256 495, it was anticipated that it would be relatively straighfforward to produce potent and specific anti H LA reagents and thereby circumvent the problems discussed above. Most of the monoclonal anti HLA anti bodies so far produced, however, have recognized either monomorphic or broadly cross reacting determinants and hence have had limited utility in tissue typing. In fact, based on the information obtained heretofore, there has remained substantial uncertainty whether or not a significant number of HLA encoded alloantigens possess unique epitopes and whether experimental animals with the appropriate Ir gene repertoire for responding to those epitopes will be available, should such distinct epitopic sites exist.There is also uncertainty whether monoclonal antibodies which detect useful specificity groups can be developed.Brief Description of the Prior Art Brodsky et al., Immunological Review, 1979 47 4, provides an excellent review of the field at the time of the article. Grumet et al., Human Immunol oov 1982 5 61, describes a monoclonal antibody which divides HLA B27 into two subgroups. Muller et al., Human lmmunoloov 1983 6 189, describes an IgM monoclonal antibody directed against an antigenic determinant which is shared by the HLA allospecificities A2 and A28. Muller et al., Human Immunology 1983 Z 229, describes a monoclonal antibody specific for the private alloantigenic determinant of the HLA B13 molecule.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Methods and compositions are provided which permit histocompatibility typing of human lymphoid cells. Hybrid cell lines are produced which secrete monoclonal antibodies specific for various HLA alloantigens. Panels of these monoclonal antibodies find use in diagnosis and therapy. The hybrid cell lines can also serve as sources of DNA encoding antibodies for the various HLA allospecificities, which DNA can be manipulated using recombinantDNA rDNA technology to enable other cellular hosts to produce specific antibody.DESCRIPTION OF THE SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS In accordance with the subject invention, novel cell lines and compositions are provided, which allow for histocompatibility typing of human cells, particularly lymphoid cells. The subject cell lines have a murine chromosome, wherein the germ lineDNA has been rearranged to code for an antibody receptor s having a binding site s specific for an epitope s on an HLA antigen s . Panels of these monoclonal antibodies produced by the subject cell lines can be used in a wide variety of methods, both for diagnosis and therapy. The monoclonal antibodies of this invention are prepared by immortalizing nucleic acid capability for expression of antibodies specific for the various human HLA A alloantigens. Immortalization may be achieved by introducing DNA encoding for the antibody ies into a host capable of being grown in culture or by transformation of a cell capable of antibody production. The immortalized cell line may be a mammalian cell line which has been transformed through oncogenesis, by transfection, mutation or the like. Such cells include myeloma lines, lymphoma lines, etc., namely those lines which are capable of supporting the expression and secretion of the antibody ies in vitro tissue culture .The antibody may be a naturally occurring immunoglobulin of a mammal, produced by transformation of a lymphocyte, particularly a splenocyte by means of a virus or by fusion of a lymphocyte with a neoplastic cell, for example, a myeloma, to produce a hybrid cell line. Alternatively, the antibody ies may be an immunoglobulin produced by rDNA techniques, where, for example, genomic DNA or cDNA coding for the heavy and light chain of an HLA specific monoclonal antibody is inserted into an expression vector for expression of the chains. The transformation or fusion can be carried out in conventional ways, the fusion being described in an extensive number of U.S.PatentNos. including 4,172,124 4,350,683 4,363,799 4,381,292 and 4,423,147 see also Kennett et al., Monoclonal Antibodies , New York Plenum Press, 1980, and references cited therein and transformation being described in, for example, U.S. PatentNo. 4,464,465. The hybrid cell lines may be cloned and screened in accordance with conventional methods to detect antibodies specific for each of the various HLA alloantigens. Usually, each hybridoma line is established by at least three cycles of cloning by limiting dilution. The cells producing the desired antibody are initially identified by conventional assays e.g., cytotoxicity assays and then expanded and screened for specificity and sensitivity employing a large number 250 of human blood donors.The appropriate hybrid cell lines may be expanded in culture or injected into the peritoneal cavity of an appropriate host for the production of ascites fluid. By virtue of having antibody ies specific for one or more HLA polymorphic determinants, the supernatants from candidate hybridomas may be screened in competition with the subject monoclonal antibodies known to be specific for the site in a competitive assay. Thus hybrid cell lines can be readily produced from a variety of sources based on the availability of antibodies specific for a particular polymorphism. Alternatively, where hybrid cell lines are available which produce antibodies specific for the subject polymorphism, these hybrid cell lines may be fused with other neoplasticB cells where such other B cells may serve as recipients for genomic DNA encoding the monoclonal antibodies.While rodent, particularly murine, neoplastic B cells are preferred, other mammalian species may be employed, such as lagomorpha, bovine, ovine, equine, porcine, avian or the like, which animals and birds can provide lymphocytes, particularly splenocytes, for fusion and will recognize the various human HLA polymorphisms as antigenic. The monoclonal antibodies MAbs may be of any of the classes or subclasses, such as IgM, IgD, IgA, IgG1, lug2, lgG3 or IgG4, or IgE, or the host equivalent thereof. The monoclonal antibodies which are selected for HLA typing can have a number of properties of interest depending on how they are to be used.Properties of interest include affinity constants Ka of at least 106, usually 106, preferably 1010 M . The monoclonal antibodies should retain the same specificity over a wide range of dilution greater than 5 fold, preferably greater than 10 fold and should not exhibit cross reactivity as a function of concentration within this range. However, they may have different useful specificities at concentrations outside this range. For some purposes the property of complement fixation is of interest, particularly for use in assays based on complement mediated lysis. The monoclonal antibodies should be stable upon storage for long periods of time. For the purposes of this application the degree of specificity of the various MAbs monoclonal antibodies will be indicated as follows Private intends binding to a unique determinant on a single alloantigen oligotypic intends binding to a determinant which is found on from 2 to 5 different alloantigens supertypic intends binding to a determinant which is found on greater than 5 different alloantigens and framework intends binding to a determinant found on substantially all alloantigens of a particular species. Depending on the purpose for which HLA typing is being performed e.g., transplant, paternity, etc. different panels of monoclonals may be employed. Of particular interest are those oligotypic or supertypic monoclonal antibodies which react with alleles of the same locus. A panel of two to four of these antibodies can completely define this locus.This low stringency definition may well be sufficient for matching donor and recipient in some transplant situations such as platelet transfusion. Hybridoma cell lines producing monoclonal antibodies having the following binding specificities are of interest private Al, 2, 3, 24 Bw6, 8, 13, 44 DR1, 3, 4, 5, 7, w52, w53 DQwl, w3, and w3.1 oligotypic A2, w69 A2, 28 , A23, 24, 25 32 , A25, 32 , B14, 18, 39, 59 , B17, 27 , DR1, 2, 7 , DR5, 8 , DR4, 5, 13 , DR3, 5, 6, 7 , DQwl, DQ blank , and DQw2, w3, blank supertypic Al, 11, 23, 24, 25, 26, 36, 68.2 , A2, 3, 28, 29, 30, 31, 33, 68, 69 , B7, 27, 42, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 63 14, 46 , and B8, 18, 39, 41, 45, 61 specificities in parentheses indicated binding at a different concentration from that at which the other specificities are bound blank indicates an unassigned specificity known to be distinct from DQwl, 2 and 3 .These monoclonal antibodies can find use by themselves or in conjuction with antibodies reported by others, e.g., B27, Ellis et , al., Human Immunoioav 1982 5 49. Specificities which have not been previously reported as being available for an individual monoclonal antibody are Al, 24, Al, 11, 23, 24, 25, 26, 36, 68.2 , A2, 3, 28, 29, 30, 31, 33, 68, 69 DR5, 8 , DR4, 5, 13 , DR3, 5, 6, 7 , DQw1, DQ blank , and DQw2, w3, DQ blank . In accordance with recombinant DNA technol ogy, the messenger RNAs transcribed from the genes encoding the heavy and light chains of the monoclonal antibodies of this invention, can be isolated by differential cDNA hybridization employing cDNA from Baltic lymphocytes, other than the clones of this invention. Thus, messenger RNA which does not hybridize will be enriched with messenger RNAs encoding the desired immunoglobulin chain. This process can be repeated so as to further enhance the level of the desired messenger RNA. The subtracted mRNA composition can then be reverse transcribed to provide for a cDNA mixture enriched with desired sequences.The RNA may by hydrolyzed with alkali or an appropriate RNase, and the single strand of DNA made double stranded with DNA polymerase 1 and random primers, for example, randomly fragmented calf thymus DNA. The resulting double strandedDNA can then be cloned by insertion into an appropriate vector including virus vectors, such as the lambda vectors, Xdv and Charon, or plasmid vectors, such as pBR322 and pACYC184, etc. Known sequences for the constant regions of the light and heavy chain can be used as probes for identifying those clones having the cDNA gene encoding the desired heavy and light chains. By appropriate manipulation, the genes can be excised from the plasmids, manipulated to remove superfluous DNA upstream from the initiation codon, and introduced into an appropriate vector for transformation of a host for expression of the genes.Conveniently, mammalian hosts can be employed which can properly process the chain so as to join the heavy and light chains to produce an intact immunoglobulin and furthermore, secrete that immunoglobulin free of the leader sequence. Alternatively, one can use unicellular microorganisms for producing the chain, where further manipulation may be required to remove the DNA sequence encoding the secretory leader and processing signal, including the membrane integration sequence while providing for an initiation codon at the 5 terminus of the sequence coding for the heavy chain. In this manner the immunoglobulins can be prepared and processed so as to be assembled and glycosylated in cells other than murine cells.If desired, each of the chains can be truncated so as to retain at least the variable region, which regions can then be manipulated to provide for a receptor specific for the HLA polymorphic determinants of interest. The monoclonal antibodies of this invention find a wide variety of uses, both In vitro and in vivo.In vitro, panels of these antibodies are particularly useful for histocompatibility typing. See, for example, U.S. Patent No. 4,471,056 which is incorporated herein by reference. For such purposes they may be employed in labeled or unlabeled form.When unlabeled they can be used in agglutination or complement dependent cytotoxicity assays, or in combination with other labeled antibodies specific for immunoglobulin of the particular host species in which the monoclonal antibody was made, or such other immunoassays as involve unlabeled antibodies. Where labeled, a wide variety of labels can be employed, including radionuclides, fluorescers, enzymes, enzyme substrates, enzyme co factors, enzyme inhibitors, etc. A wide variety of immunoassays are known in the art and are illustrated by the following U.S. patents 3,817,837 3,850,752 3,901,654 3,935,074 3,984,533 3,996,345 4,034,074 and 4,098,876 which list is not intended to be exhaustive .The antibodies can be used in a variety of instrumentation, including flow microfluorimeters, where fluorescently conjugated antibodies can be used, where cells can be counted and or sorted as to their histocompatibility types. Fluorescers of interest include fluorescein,Texas red, rhodamine, umbelliferone, phycobiliproteins, dansyl and the like. Alternatively, other assays can be used, such as enzyme immunoassays where the subject antibodies are conjugated to an enzyme, or anti lg from a species other than the species of the subject antibodies is conjugated to an enzyme, and used in conjunction with the subject antibodies.Instead of anti lg a receptor specific for the immune complex may be employed, such as S.aureus protein A. Thus, a human blood sample or a fraction or lysate thereof, is combined with the subject antibodies where the subject antibodies bind to those cells having the HLA alloantigen s of interest. The cells can then be separated from the supernatant ad incubated with anti lg conjugated with an enzyme label, such as horseradish peroxidase HRP , glucose oxidase GO , glucose 6phosphate dehydrogenase G 6 PDH or the like.After washing to remove unbound labeled anti lg, the appropriate substrates are then added and the presence of the antibody enzyme conjugates specifically bound to the cells determined. Other conventional techniques can also be used. An assay of particular interest for HLA typing can be referred to as a Micro EIA. Microtray wells are coated with peptide, e.g., poly L lysine by incubating in a solution of the peptide at a moderately elevated temperature 30 50 C for about 0.1 to 2hr, the solution decanted and the wells washed. Human leukocytes are introduced into the wells, the trays centrifuged and a dilute buffered protein solution, e.g., 1 BSA or 1.25 powdered milk, added and the trays stored in a cold room, e.g., 4 C, for from 0.25 to 48hr. The plates are then thoroughly washed. In a mode referred to as indirect, monoclonal antibody to the antigen is added, the mixtures incubated, followed by thorough washing to remove non specifically bound antibody. Antibody to the monoclonal antibody anti lgX, where X is usuallyM or G , particularly as F ab 2, conjugated to an enzyme label is added followed by incubation at ambient temperatures. Usually, 0.2 to 2 hr incubation will suffice. Alternatively, both monoclonal antibody and anti lgX may be mixed and added together. For the direct assay, the monoclonal antibody is conjugated to the enzyme label, avoiding the addition of the anti lgX. The labeled antibodies are employed at appropriate concentrations in an appropriately buffered medium with a blocking agent, e.g., 0.1 BSA in PBS. The antibodies may be grouped into panels depending upon the purpose of histocompatibility typing. Where platelet matching is involved a panel of supertypic and oligotypic antibodies which covers all of the alleles of the A and B gene loci may be sufficient. Thus the antibodies P5.4 and P16.1 and antibodies covering Bw4 MAb P85.1 and Bw6 MAb P38.1 and P77.l could be employed. In paternity testing, a panel of 25 30 monoclonal antibodies covering the HLA A and B alleles would enable one to exclude paternity with a certainty of greater than 90 see, for example,Family Law Quarterly, 10 3 , 1976, and Jeannet et al., Vox Sana. 1972 23 197 . For transplantation, panels of antisera would be used to type for both class I HLA A,B and class II HLA DR, DQ . For certain disease susceptibility markers, e.g., HLAassociated diseases, such as juvenile onset diabetes, a small panel of antibodies to HLA DR and DQ could suffice, for example, as few as four. Thus the size of the antibody panel can be tailored to a specific application. Kits can be supplied for use with the subject antibodies for histocompatibility typing. Thus, the subject monoclonal antibodies can be provided usually as lyophilized compositions by themselves or in conjunction with other antibodies. Incorporated with the antibodies, which can be conjugated to a label, or unconjugated, may be buffers such asTRIS, phosphate, carbonate, borate, etc., stabilizers, biocides, inert proteins, such as bovine serum albumin or the like. Generally these materials are present in less than about 5 weight percent based on active antibody , and usually present in total amount in at least about 0.001 weight percent based on active antibody . Frequently it will be desirable to have present an inert extender or excipient to dilute the active ingredients, where the excipient can be present in from about 1 99 weight percent of the total composition. Where a second antibody is employed which binds to the subject antibodies, this antibody would be conjugated to a label and formulated in an analogous manner with the formulation of the subject antibodies. The subject antibodies find use in other ways, such as affinity chromatography, purification of the various HLA polymorphic antigens, separation of cells containing one antigen to the exclusion of cells containing other antigens, which separation can involve cytotoxic conditions and the like. Thus, the subject antibodies find a broad spectrum of uses both in vitro and in vivo. The following examples are offered by way of illustration and not by way of limitation.EXPERIMENTALMaterials and MethodsMonoclonal antibody production Mice of the strains Balb c, C57B1 6 or F, progeny thereof are immunized with HLA antigens either as presented on human lymphoblastoid cells or in fractions enriched by immunoprecipitation orHLA antigens obtained from such cells. Mice are immunized by injection subcutaneously or intraperitoneally with or without adjuvant. Mice receive from one to five injections spleens are removed three days following the last injection. Splenic B lymphocytes from the immunized mice are fused with NS1 1 or SPO 2 myeloma cells using 40 w v polyethylene glycol Kodak, MW 1450 and a standard protocol as described Kohler and Milstein, suDra . Following fusion the cell mixture is resuspended in HAT medium RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 20 bovine serum, tx10 4M hypoxanthine, 4x10 7M aminopterin and 1.6x10 5M thymidine to select for growth of hybrid cells and dispensed into a 96 well microculture tray at a concentration of 1 to 3x106 cells ml. Cells producing appropriate antibody are identified either by an assay measuring complementdependent lysis of human leukocytes NAIADManual of Tissue TvDina Technioues NIH Lvmohocvte Microcvtotoxicitv Technique USDHEW No. NIH 36 41 1979 1980 or by an enzyme linked microimmunoassay measuring binding to human leukocytes see below . Each hybridoma line is established by three cycles of cloning by limiting dilution using syngeneic thymocytes as feeder cells. Monoclonal antibody protein is isolated by conventional means from ascites fluid using affinity chromatography on S. aureus protein A sepharose Pharmacia , ammonium sulphate precipitation or ion exchange chromatography. Ascites fluid is obtained by growth of hybridoma cells in the peritoneal cavity of syngeneic or F, mice primed one to four weeks earlier with an intraperitoneal injection of pristane. The isotype of the monoclonal antibody is determined by ELISA.Cell panel Specificity of the monoclonal antibodies is determined by assaying reactivity to members of a panel of T lymphocytes from 150 individuals and a panel of 160 B lymphoblastoid lines. T lymphocytes are obtained from peripheral blood by density gradient centrifugation on Ficoll Hypaque, adherence on plastic and passage through nylon wool and B lymphocytes are obtained by eluting adherent cells from the nylon wool Danilovs et a 8th International Histocornoatibility Workshoo Newsletter 1978 6 3 . B lymphoblastoid lines were obtained from peripheral B lymphocytes transformed with Epstein Barr virus. in addition, each antibody was assayed for specificity and sensitivity on a panel of 250 to 1000 randomly chosen donors.Micro enzyme linked immunosorbent assay EIA to detect monoclonal antibody binding to HLA antigens This assay is used in an indirect mode to identify hybridomas secreting antibody to HLA antigens. This assay may also be used in a direct or an indirect mode with known monoclonal antibodies to determine the HLA type of human cells. Terasaki microtrays are prepared by addition to each well of 5ul of a liig ml solution of poly Llysine in phosphate buffered saline PBS . Alternatively, antibodies to human leukocytes 5UI of O.lug per xI may be added to each well and the plates incubated at 400C for 18 24 hours. The plates are incubated at 370C for lhr and washed with PBS by immersion and decanting.Human leukocytes are dispensed into each well, lul of a suspension of 1 to 5x106 cells per ml ofRPMI 1640 medium without serum. The plates are centrifuged at 90g for 3min. A solution of 1 bovine serum albumin BSA in PBS with 0.2 azide is added to the plates which are stored at 4 C for 1 to 48 hours or at ambient temperature for 15 minutes. Before adding antibody, the plates are washed with PBS and 1.25 powdered milk inPBS. In the indirect assay, monoclonal antibody is added, 1 ALl per well. After 1 hour at room temperature, the plates are washed five times and a solution of the F ab 2 fragment of anti immunoglobulin coupled with horseradish peroxidase HRP is added, 5ul per well. Alternatively, both monoclonal antibody and anti immunoglobulin may be mixed and added together. The plates are then incubated at room temperature for 30 to 60min. in the direct assay, HRP is coupled to the monoclonal antibody, the second step is thus unnecessary. Antibodies coupled to HRP are diluted in a solution of 0.1sub BSA in PBS without azide. After treatment with antibody, the trays are washed five times. The presence of HRP antibody complexes in the wells is visualized by the addition of a solution of substrate, hydrogen peroxide, and chromagen, OPD Organon Diagnostics, West Orange, NJ or ABTS Boehringer MannheimBiochemicals, Indianapolis, IN in 0.1 M sodium citrate 0.2M sodium phosphate. Color change in wells after 30 to 60min incubation at room temperature indicates binding of monoclonal antibody to leukocytes in those wells.Analysis of the specificity of monoclonal antibodies by immunoprecipitation of labeled HLA antigens Membrane proteins of lymphoblastoid cells are labeled with 11251 using lactoperoxidase Vitetta et ai., J. Exo. Med. 1971 134 242 . Cells are disrupted in buffer containing 0.5 Nonidet P 40 and cleared by centrifugation both before and after addition of control antibody and solid phase immunoadsorbent. Monoclonal antibodies are added to aliquots of the lysate and complexes of antibody and labeled antigen precipitated using S. aureus protein A or rabbit antibody to mouse immunoglobulin coupled to a solid phase.After extensive washing, the labeled antigens are released by addition of sample electrophoresis buffer either as required for the Laemmli method of electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels or as specified for the nonequilibrium two dimensional gel electrophoresis method of O Farrell. Electrophoresis is conducted as required for each method. Labelled proteins in the dried gels are identified by radioautography.Analysis of the specificity of monoclonal antibodies labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate FITC using a fluorescence activated cell sorter FACS Monoclonal antibody isolated from ascites was conjugated to FITC according to the method ofGoding Goding, J. Immunol. Methods 1976 13 215 . Cells to be analyzed were mixed with saturating amounts of FlTC conjugated antibody and incubated for 30min at 40C. Treated cells were washed and the amount of antibody bound assessed by comparing the fluorescence intensity mean modal of cells incubated with test and control antibodies on a FACS IV Becton Dickinson fitted with a log amplifier. Results A small proportion of the total number of fusions provided murine monoclonal antibodies which are specific for HLA epitopes which are present on one or a limited number of class I or class II alleles.

First, and the one most used at the present time, is complement dependent lysis. Second are assays measuring binding of antibody to lymphocytes by enzyme linked immunoassay ELISA . Elements of the first method have been combined with standard format ELISA assays to develop a micro ELISA assay suitable for HLA typing. The third uses a fluorescing compound to measure binding of antibody to lymphocytes.Fluorescein isothiocyanate and a fluorescence activated cell sorter was used to analyze the specificity of the subject antibodies. All antibodies listed in Table 1 have been tested and give the same reactions in each of these three assays. An example of typing human T lymphocytes with a panel of these antibodies is given in Table 3. The antibodies in Table 2 also are effective in the three assay systems except for antibodies 4AA7, 143.1 and 142.1 these antibodies do not fix complement and are suitable for assays 2 and 3 only. An example of typing B lymphocytes for class II HLA antigens using several monoclonal antibodies is given in Table 4. The panels of Tables 3 and 4 consist of a series of HLA monoclonal antibodies which are chosen to define a series of overlapping but distinct HLA antigens. The matrix of positive and negative results with the panel of antibodies permits an assignment of an HLA type in the tested individual. A panel of monoclonal antibodies has several advantages over previously available conventional alloantisera panels 1 these antibodies are available in infinite supply, thus, once their specificity is defined no additional characterization is required.By contrast, tissue typing is currently carried out using sera obtained from multiparous women or multiply transfused patients. Only limited amounts of such reagents are available from any one donor.Accordingly, it is necessary to continually replace these antisera with new reagents which must be standardized and checked against the previous ones. 2 Because of the heterogeneous nature of antibodies obtained in this fashion, cross reactivity and contamination with multiple antibodies of varying specificity are major problems. With a monoclonal panel individual cloned antibodies can be used at high concentration without concern for contaminating specificities. 3 Alloantisera are usually very low titered thus requiring a higher concentration of serum in the reaction mixture. This can contribute to non specific binding of protein to cell surfaces and result in false negative results in the complement dependent assay. Furthermore, these sera are less useful in binding assays due to the potential of nonspecific binding of protein to cell surface. Monoclonal antibodies in contrast can be purified and concentrated to produce titers in the thousands. 4 Because of the exquisite specificity of these antibodies they have wider application in a variety of assay formats. The use of the monoclonal antibody panel makes possible the use of a variety of assay methodologies which are not feasible with the conventional antibody panels. These include, but are not limited to, automated fluorescence methods, ELISA based methods, and flow cytometry. Although the foregoing invention has been described in some detail by way of illustration and example for purposes of clarity of understanding, it will be obvious that certain changes and modifications may be practiced.
