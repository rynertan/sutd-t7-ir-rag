# Low temperature lead and cadmium free frits.

## Abstract
This invention relates to the production of frits especially suitable for use in contact with foods. The frits are essentially free from cadmium and lead and consist essentially, in weight percent on the oxide basis, of Li₂O 3 4 Al₂O₃ 6.75 8.75 Na₂O 0.75 3 SiO₂ 48 55 BaO 3.5 9.5 ZrO₂ 6.75 10.5 B₂O₃ 14 17.5 F 3.5 4.
