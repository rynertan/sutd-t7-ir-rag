# WHEEL ASSEMBLY

## Abstract
A wheel assembly adapted to be fastened to a projecting support member 8 of a wheeled structure. The wheel as sembly comprises a pair of spaced parallel flanges 1, 2 which defines a cavity 3 for receiving a wheel assembly support 8 at one end and a cavity 4 receiving a wheel 11 at the other end. A plurality of strengthening ribs 6, 7 are formed in each flange adjacent the wheel assembly support cavity 3 . The portion of the flanges 1, 2 which form the wheel supporting cavity 4 are outwardly convex in shape around the wheel 11 . Thus, the wheel assembly in accord ance with the present invention may be fabricated of light gauge sheet metal without sacrificing strength.
