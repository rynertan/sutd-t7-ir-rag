## Description
Stunning installation for slaughtercattle. The invention relates to a stunning installation for slaughtercattle, more in particular for pigs, comprising two parallel extending endless conveyor belts of which the opposed conveying surfaces define a V shaped passage in which electrodes can be moved until they contact the animal to be stunned and can be retracted by means of a cylinder in response to a signal initiated by the animal itself. Such a stunning installation is for instance known from theEastern German Patent 89062 respectively from the Dutch laid open patent application 7705519. In the first mentioned known installation the animal, which is moved by a transport system, interrupts a light beam initiating the signal for descending the electrodes by means of a cylinder installed onto a carriage. This known installation is working continuously and automatically but has the disadvantage that the electrodes, which move along a fixed path do not always touch the head of the animal in the correct way, so that a quick stunning is not always assured. If the stunning does not take place fast and with the correct voltage, muscle contraction can appear leading to breakage of bones and internal bleedings thereby reducing the quality of the meat. In the second known stunning installation the animals to be stunned are realizing the contact with the electrodes themselves and a better result is obtained, which results can be improved further to reach a very high stunning production without any decrease in meat quality by using further improvements, such as disclosed among others in the laid open Dutch application 7904935. With the latter installation a high production can be reached fully automatically. Small slaughter houses with a low production, respectively slaughter houses with insufficient room for a stunning line of adequate length, so as for instance with two conveyor systems following each other as disclosed in the Dutch application 7705519, are in need of a stunning installation which attains in a simple way the advantages of the automatical stunning and which does not have the disadvantages of the manual stunning process as known form theU.S.Patent 2,185,949. These disadvantages are that the person, who has to carry out this stunning proces, is suffering from stress and also because of this stress respectively because of tiredness, the electrodes are placed inadequately exact or correct. This leads to the above mentioned disadvantages. The aimed object is according to the invention attained by positioning sensing electrodes in the V shaped passage, which electrodes are incorporated in the driving circuit of the conveyor system such, that at the detection of an animal by means of a low sensing voltage on the sensing electrodes the driving of the conveyor system stops, whereafter the sensing voltage disappears, and that the control system of the cylinder moving said stunning electrodes comprises a push button, actuation of which causes descending of said electrodes. The invention therefore leaves the principle of a fully automatic stunning installation and provides a semi automatic system in which first of all the movement of the animal is stopped as soon as is detected by means of the sensing current, that the animal is arrived at the desired place, whereafter the animal will settle quiet as result of the disappearing sensing voltage, whereafter the operator, not manually but by activating said push button, causes the operating cylinder to move the electrodes towards the head of the animal. Said electrode can be a known bifurcated electrode shooting into the neck of the animal or preferably engaging the animal transversely across the Snout. The stunning installation according to the invention does not have the high production rate of the fully automatic installation according to the laid open Dutch application 7u904935. However, the proposed installation is significantly simplified avoiding thereby the drawbacks associated with the manual stunning process, whereas the percentage of animals showing a decrease in meat quality as result of said stunning, is exceptably low. The operator is able to determine, after the conveyor system is come to a stand still, if the head of the animal is sufficiently in rest and is positioned in the line of movement of the electrodes, whereby the operator eventually can interfere by changing the direction in which the electrodes are moving.The operator is not or considerably less suffering from stress , because he himself is not contacting the animal with the electrodes, but takes care thereof by activating a push button and using auxiliary means. Furthermore a saving in personal is possible with this installation. The driving, stunning, chain lifting and knife stubbing of the cattle can be done by a smaller number of persons, because the stunning process only requires the actuation of a push button. The conveyor belts can be restarted by pressing a push button or can restart automatically when the stunning voltage disappears. Preferably the sensing electrodes are embodied as chains and said sensing electrodes and the stunning electrodes are fixed to a frame, which is adjustable in height as adaption to animals having different sizes. The chains are a simple means for applying a sensing voltage such that a sensing current can run from one side of the snout to the other side to determine in a known way if the sensed resistance corresponds to that of a pig or an other animal. The chains preferably have links which are pivotable around parallel extending axes. Such chains are stiff in the direction of said axes and will not touch each other when they are suspended with said axes transverse to the conveying direction. Preferably said frame carries at the discharge end of the conveying system a passage closing plate, pivotably connected to said system. Said plate can be coupled to means interrupting the stunning system when said plate is moving. Manual assistance can be necessary to move a stunned animal out of the installation and in that case a protection is needed. Preferably all parts, i.e. said plate the sensing electrods and the stunning electrodes are positioned near the exit of the conveying system, so that the stunned animal almost falls out of the installation. The invention will now be explained in more detail with reference to the drawings. Fig. 1 shows a longitudinal cross section through the installation according to the invention. Fig. 2 shows a rear view, i.e. a view in the direction of movement of the conveyor system. Fig. 3 shows a view corresponding to that of Fig. 1 of another embodiment. The installation, shown in the figures, includes two endless conveys belts 1 and 2, comprising plates which are pivotably connected to each other. The animal 3 to be stunned is moved between said conveyor systems in a known way in the direction of the arrow 4. Above the conveyor systems 1 and 2 a frame is installed pivotably connected to a not shown support. Said id frame 5 carries a clamp 7 for the operating cylinder 8 of a stunning electrode system 9. Said operating cylinder is guided by means of a slideable bush 10 comprising a operating knob 11 above said clamp 7 to move said bush to and fro. Because of said movement it is possible to determine the direction in which the cylinder 8 will move the electrodes 9. The frame 5 further carries sensing electrodes 12 and 13 in the form of chains, which are insulated from each other and cannot touch each other. If the animal touches two of these chains, a sensing current can run through the head of the animal and that results into a signal for bringing the conveyor belts 1 and 2 to a stand still and for switching off said sensing current. The operator is able, eventually after directioning the electrodes 9, to activate said cylinder 8 by operating a push button, so that the electrodes will be moved downwards untillthey reach the head of the animal, which animal is stunned by a stunning voltage running between said V shaped electrode 9 and the chains 12. The retraction of the electrodes can be made dependent onto the releasing of said push button or can be determined by a timing mechanism. The frame 5 furthermore carries a triangular plate 15 of which the upper edge is pivotably connected to said frame at 16. If the conveyor system is set in motion again, the animal can pass simply along said sensing electrodes and underneath said plate. If assistance from operating personal is needed for removing the animal from the installation, then said plate has to be moved out of the way. To avoid that the operating personal comes in contact with the stunning voltage, the stunning circuit comprises a switch coupled to said plate and activated by the movement of said plate out of the vertical position, so that the stunning circuit automatically is disconnected. The frame 5 can be adjustable in height direction, for instance by means of a cylinder 17 as adaption to the size of the animal. Fig.3 shows an embodiment in which the chains 18 are only used for contacting the sensing currents and for realizing the further functions of the sensing voltage. The stunning electrodes comprise two plates 19 insulated from each other., which latess are in form adapted to the form of the snout and can be applied to both sides of said snout.
