# Method for the assembly of an inner race for a roller bearing and an annular cage whose openings contain rolling elements.

## Abstract
For assembling the rollers 2 in their innerring 1 of a rolling bearing the cage 3 with rollers is somewhat forced over the innermost shoulder of said innerring. The cage 3 by that remains somewhat deformed and as tests have shown therefore introduces disturbances in the lubrication. To avoid such distur bances and consequently high friction by said cage deformation, according to the claimed measure a relatively small part 16 of the innerring flange 7 which in the mounting position forms the inner flange, is removed according to a conical plane. By this measure the rolling bodies 2 in their cage 3 can easily slide over this flange part 7 in their race ways 4 thus avoiding cage deformations.
