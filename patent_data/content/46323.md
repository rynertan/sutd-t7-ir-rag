# Method of writing and reading sector organized information into and out of a record carrier body and device for performing the method.

## Abstract
A description is given of a method and an associ ated device for the writing and reading of information into and from a record carrier body. The record carrier body is preferably made of a radiation sensitive medium and comprises a servo track. The information is written in consecutively arranged sectors and is read directly after writing for the purpose of verification. A vector address VA n is added to the amount of information to be written in a sector. A vector address of this kind indicates a previously inscribed sector of the record carrier body, said previously inscribed sector having the property that the information has been correctly written therein. The added vector address enables the transfer of only the correctly written information to a user when the written information is read. The use of so called interleaving during the inscribing of information in the record carrier body protects the information written against an error burst.
