## Description
DESCRIPTION PROCESS FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF TETRA ALKOXYSILANES The present invention relates to a process for the manufacture of tetra alkoxysilanes. It is known from European Patent No. 0004730 that tetra ethoxysilane can be prepared by reacting together ethanol and silicon or a metal silicide in a solution system containing a catalyst, the reaction products being tetra ethoxysilane vapour, hydrogen gas and ethanol vapour, characterised in that the solution system has a thermal capacity sufficient to convert at least 66 of the solution or silicide and to discharge the reaction products, this being achieved by including at least 500 ml of inert solvent for each mole of silicon or silicide. We have found that the cost effectiveness of this type of process, expressed as the weight of product produced from a given volume of reacting liquid in a given time in a given system, can be improved and that this is a function of the quality of the starting materials and the catalyst. According to the present invention, therefore, a process for the manufacture of tetra alkoxysilanes in which each alkoxy group contains up to five carbon atoms is provided which comprises reacting together an alcohol, as herein defined, and particulate silicon or a metal silicide in a solution system containing a catalyst with a high concentration of alkali metal ion, the particle size of the silicon or metal silicide being no greater than 20 microns. When we refer to alcohol in the present specification in relation to our invention we include methanol, ethanol, a propanol, a butanol, methoxyetbanol, ethoxyethanol and aminosubstituted alcohols having up to five carbon atoms. The alcohol is preferably as dry as possible. The catalyst may be, for example, the sodium salt of 2 methoxyethanol or of 2 butoxyethanol but it is preferred to use the sodium salt of 2 ethoxyethanol.It is possible to use a salt of another alkali metal, for example, a potassium salt, in place of a sodium salt although this would be more expensive. A suitable high concentration of the sodium salt of 2 ethoxyethanol in the preparation of tetraethoxysilane is 5 gramme moles of sodium per litre of tetra ethoxysilane. Higher concentrations of catalyst can be used and the upper limit is affected by catalyst solubility. In order to maintain the high concentration of alkali metal ion in the reactor the plant is designed to give a volume of liquids which is approximately constant at all times. The Invention is illustrated by the following Example, EXAMPLE Tetra ethoxysilane 200 kgs 215 litres 2 micron silicon 70 kg 2.5 nls Catalyst 177 kgs containing 1 kg mole Na ion . 70 kgs 2.5 mls of silicon powder at least 95 pure are slurried with 200 kgs 215 litres of tetra etoxysilane TEOS and pumped to a reactor and this is followed by the addition of 177 kgs of the sodium salt of 2 ethoxyethanol containing 1 kg mole sodium ion as catalyst. The mixture is stirred and heated to 1300C wlsen ethanol which is as dry as possible is fed to the reactor. Hydrogen gas is evolved and the reaction becomes exothermic and gradually rises to 165 175 C.Reaction temperature controlled in the 160 180 C maximum range. The reaction is allowed to proceed for 18 hours by which time the production rate has dropped to 70 100 kgs per hour. During this period the TEOS being produced has been removed and fractionated in situ with alcohol being recycled. TEOS is removed stoichiometrically as alcohol is converted to TEOS. This maintains the pot level at approximately 215 litres at all times. Under these conditions yields of 3400 kgs to 3800 kgs over 18 hours were achieved. The average production rate was 189 kg hr. to 211 kg hr. of a product that was at least 98 pure TEOS. When the procedure of the Example was repeated using identical conditions except that only half the quantity of catalyst is used, then the yield obtained was only 1690 kgs, i.e. 94 kgs hr. If the procedure of the Example is repeated except that commercially available 75 micron powdered silicon was used in place of the 2 micron silicon, then the yield falls to 1700 kgs over 18 hours, i.e. 95 kgs hr.
