# Poly ester amide derived from 6 hydroxy 2 naphthoic acid, another aromatic hydroxy acid, dicarboxylic acid and an aromatic monomer capable of forming an amide link.

## Abstract
A melt processable poly ester amide which is capable of forming an anisotropic melt phase is provided. The poly ester amide of the present invention consists essential ly of the recurring units a 6 oxy 2 naphthoyl moiety, b other aromatic moiety derived from aromatic hydroxyacid, c carbocyclic dicarboxyl moiety, d aromatic moiety cap able of forming an amide linkage in the polymer, and, optionally, e dioxyaryl moiety in the proportions indicated. Preferably, the moiety capable of forming an amide linkage is derived from p aminophenolor p phenylenediamine. The resulting poly ester amide exhibits a melting temperature below 40 C., preferably below 350 C. The poly ester amide of the present invention is preferably formed by a melt polymerisation technique.
