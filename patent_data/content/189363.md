# Reaming tool for threading machines.

## Abstract
A reaming tool 40 is mountable on the tooling carriage 47 of a power driven threading machine for continuous motion displacement along two rails 48, 50 and between use and storage positions in which a reaming blade 44 of the tool 40 is respectively coaxial with a tubular workpiece to be reamed and supported laterally outwardly adjacent the tooling carriage 47 . The reaming tool 40 is comprised of an elongate arm 42 carrying the reaming blade 44 , and one end of the arm 42 is mounted on the tooling carriage 47 for pivotal movement of the arm 42 about a first axis 82 laterally offset and parallel to the workpiece axis A , and a second axis 90 perpendicular to the first axis 82 .
