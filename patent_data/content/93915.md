NOVEL B LACTAM DERIVATIVESThe present invention relates to a novel class of B lactam antibiotics of the general formulaEMI1.1 wherein R is Cl C6 alkyl or C3 C6 alkenyl, n is zero or one and the stylized groupEMI1.2 represents a mono or polycyclic N containing heterocyclic group, and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and esters.This invention also relates to the process. for preparing such compounds, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them and to methods of treatment comprising administering such compounds and. compositions when an antibiotic effect is desired.In the present. specification and claims, the term Cl C6 alkyl is intended to refer to a straight or branched alkyl group containing from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, and the term C3 C6 alkenyl designates a straight or branched alkenyl group containing from 3 to 6 carbon atoms and one or two double bonds.The term mono or polycyclic N containing heterocyclic group identifies mono , bi , and tri cyclic groups, each cycle consisting of 5 or 6 atoms, which may optionally contain 1,2, or 3 additional heteroatoms, each independently selected fromN, O, or S, and the carbon and nitrogen atoms of any such ring may carry substituents selected from the group consisting of hydroxy, halogen, amino, monoor di C1 C6 alkylamino, nitro, Cl C6 alkoxy, substituted or unsubstituted C1 C6 alkyl, substituted or unsubstituted C3 C6 alkenyl1 phenyl, substituted phenyl, substituted or unsubstituted phenyl Cl C6 alkyl, and substituted or unsubstituted 5 or 6 membered heterocyclic, wherein the substituent or substituents are selected from halogen, hydroxy, alkoxy, carboxy, alkyl, or phenyl.A preferred group of compounds of the present invention comprises those compounds of formula I wherein R is ethyl and n and the stylized groupEMI2.1 as defined above, and their corresponding pharmaceutically acceptable salts and esters.A most preferred. group of compounds comprises those compounds of formula I wherein R is ethyl, n is zero and the stylized groupEMI2.2 represents a monocyclicN containing heterocyclic group, and their corresponding pharmaceutically acceptable salts and esters.For the purposes of the present application, the term pharmaceutically acceptable salts include those salts of the alkali and alkaline earth metals, of these the sodium and potassium salts are preferred. The term pharma ceutically acceptable esters refers to the esters which are known in the bicyclic ss lactam antibiotic art, such as the cephalosporins and penicillins, to be effective as pharmaceutically acceptable esters.Among the suitable esters there are those esters which derive from the carboxylic acids I by replacing the carboxyl group with a COOR1 group wherein R1 stands for one of the following groups straight or branched alkyl having from 1 to. 6 carbon atoms, such as methyl, ethyl, t butyl and the like, alkanoyloxyalkyl wherein the alkanoyloxy portion is straight or branched and. has 1. to 6 carbon atoms and the alkyl portion. has 1 to 6 carbon. atoms, such as pivaloyloxymethyl halo alkyl wherein halo is chloro and the alkyl portion is. straight or branched having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, e.g. 2,2,2 trichloroethyl aralkyl and lower alkoxy and nitro substituted aralkyl, such as benzyl, benzhydryl, trityl, o nitrobenzyl, p nitrobenzyl, p methoxybenzyl phthalidyl, dimethyl phthalidyl, benzyloxy alkyl having 8 to 10 carbon atoms such as benzyloxymethyl and benzyloxyethyl, and p nitro benzy loxyrmethyl. The compounds of the present invention may have the cis or trans geometry about the Flactam, that is to say that the hydrogen atoms at C S and C 6 may lie cis or trans to each other.Formula I above therefore encompasses either mixtures of the optically active trans or cis isomers or the single optically active components. In most cases however the antibacterial activity of the end carbapenem antibiotics and their inhibitory activity against ss lactamases is tied to the trans configuration therefore a preferred group of compounds of formula I includes those compounds in which the hydrogen atoms at C S and C 6 have trans stereochemistry. The compounds of the present invention can be easily prepared by the process which is schematically represented in the following Chart I CHART IEMI4.1 In the first step of the process described in Chart I, the bicyclic ketoester of formula II, wherein R is as defined above and the COOR1 group represents a cleavable ester group or a pharmaceutically acceptable ester, is converted into the enol phosphate III, by reaction with diphenyl chlorophosphate The obtained intermediate, without isolation, is reacted with a suitablv selected nucleophile of formula HSCH2 CH, EMI5.1 wherein the stylized groupEMI5.2 has the same meanings as betore, and R hydrogen or an easily removable protecting group of the amino funtion.In some particular cases in fact, the heterocyclic substituent may enhance the nucleophylicity of the amino group and in order to avoid the competitive. attack of the amino group instead of the thsl group on the enol phosphate III, it is necessary to protect the amino group during the course of the reaction. This protective group, typically a benzyl or p nitrobenzylester group, may then be easily removed by hydrogenolysis. The reaction between the enrol phosphate III and the nucleophile HS CH2 CH 2 EMI5.3 affords the ester I .If desired the sulfide group can then be oxidized to sulfoxide to give the corresponding esters I .When a compound of formula I in the form of the free acid or as a corresponding salt thereof is desired, it is obtained, according to the last step described inChart I above, by catalytic deprotection of the corresponding ester of formula I or II . Of course in this case, in the starting ketoester II, R1 must be selected properly within the class of readily removable protecting groups. Suitable cleavable esters are for instance the beyl, p nitrobenzyl, benzhydryl, trytyl, t butyl and trichloroethyl esters and the like.In particular the first step reported in Chart I above is accomplished by contacting a solution of the bicyclic ketoester II in a solvent such as acetonitrile, dimethyl formamide, methylene chloride, or the like solvents with the stoichiometric amount or a slight excess of diphenyl chlorophosphate in the presence of a tertiary nitrogen base such as ethyldiisopropylamine, triethylamine or the like, to neutralize the hydrochloric acid produced during the course of the reaction. The reaction is preferably carried out at low temperatures, most preferably at a temperature comprised between about 10 C and about 0 C.In the second step of the reaction,a stoichiometric to four fold excess of the suitably selected nucleophile HS CH CH EMI6.1 is added to the reaction mixture containing the intermediate III. The reaction which is typically carried out at a temperature comprised between 30 C and 20 C, and preferably between 200C and 10 C, is accomplished in 20 minutes to 4 hours. In general the ester I thus obtained crystallizes out from the mixture during the course of the reaction and is recovered by filtration. In some cases however,it may be necessary to concentrate the reaction mixture to a smallvOlume and to 7hill it in order to complete the precipitation. The S oxidation of the compounds I to the sulfoxidesI , described in the third step, can be carried out by the common methods frequently used in the p lactam antibiotic art. For example, the ester Ii is reacted with a mild oxidizing agent which, does not substantially act on the 9 lactam skeleton. such as organic peracids, especially perbenzoic acid and m chloroperbenzoic acid, phenyldichloroiodide or sodium metaperiodate.Substituted perbenzoic acids, and in particular m chloroperbenzoic acid, are preferred Typically, the oxidation reaction is carried out in the presence of an inert organic solvent, such as lower halogenated hydrocarbons, and preferably methylene chloride or chloroform, at a low temperature, preferably comprised between 30 C and 0 C, using a stoichiometric to a 10 molar excess of the oxidizing agent to the ester I . The resulting sulfoxides are then isolated and purified by the usual methods knows per se to any skilled chemist.When a. compound of formula I is desired in the form of free acid, the R1 group is splitted off in many instances by hydrogenolysis. Said reaction can be performed by hydrogenating the corresponding esters of formula I or II in a mixture of an inert organic solvent such as dioxane, tetrahydrofuran. and the like inert organic solvents non susceptible of being hydrogenated, and a buffer having pH comprised between 6 and 9 under a hydrogen pressure of from 1 to about 4 atmospheres in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst such as for instance palladium on charcoal, platinum oxide and the like.The resulting compound of formula I is then isolated and purified by the methods which are generally used in rela ted art in isolating and purifying carboxylic acid type antibiotics.These methods are well known to any skilled chemist and there are no critical procedures to be followed in the recovery and purification of the obtained compounds.Anyway, for purposes of demonstration only,a set of standard representative operations illustrating a convenient way for isolating and purifying the end acidsI is recited herein below. After having removed the catalyst by filtration, the organic solvent is evaporated off and the aqueous solution is washed with an organic water immiscible solvent, purified by ion exhange chromatography on QAE Sephadex A 25 eluting with a. gradient of phosphate buffers pH 8 and 1.5 KC1 monitoring the fractions by HPLC, and desalted. through a column of Amberlite XAD 2 resin. The appropriate fractions are combined, evaporated to small volume, filtered on Millipore , and lyophilized to give the desired compounds in the form of their alkali metal salts.Potassium salts are generally preferred, since they appeared to be less hygroscopic than the corresponding sodium salts.The starting 9 ketoester of formula II are prepared from the corresponding azetidinyl ethanols of formula IVEMI8.1 wherein R is as defined above, through the multi step process summarized in followingChart II CHART IIEMI9.1 For the oxidation of the ethanol IV to the corresponding acid V, several different oxidizers may be employed such as for instance oxygen in the presence of a catalyst such as platinum adsorbed on carbon, the Jones reagent and permanganate however the use of aqueous potassium permanganate buffered at a pH between 4 and 9, and preferably between 6.6 and 8.5, at room temperature, is preferred.The amount of oxidizing agent used in this step can be varied widely depending on the type of oxidizing agent and the reaction conditions employed.When according to a preferred embodiment, aqueous potassium permangate is employed, the suitable amount is generally comprised between 0.7 and 1.8 mole of permanganate per mole of alkanol of formula IV. Under these conditions the reaction is generally complete in 3 to 15 hours.When the oxidation reaction, which may be.monitored by G.L.C. analysis, is complete the excess of unreacted oxidizing agent remaining in the reaction mixture is decomposed if necessary, the corresponding reduced. species or the catalyst, if any, is removed, and the resulting acid of formula V is isolated and purified by methods known per se. In the second step, the side chain of the acid is elongated by transforming it into the imidazolyl derivative and then, without isolation of the obtained intermediate, reactina it with the maanesiiiin sal t nf malonic acid mono ester of formulaEMI10.1 72 Mg The reaction easily proceeds in high yield at room temperature in a polar apric. organic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran dioxane, dimethyl sulfoxide and the like.The carbonyldiimidazoie reagent is preferably employed in a slight excess over the stoichiometric, while a two to four fold molar ratio of the malonic mono ester. mono magnesium salt to the starting acid of formula V is preferably employedThe obtained ss keto ester of formula VI is recovered from the reaction mixture by acidification and extraction with a suitable organic solvent which is then boiled off and it is submitted, as such, to the diazotransfer reaction described in the third step of ChartII.This reaction is carried out by contacting an equimolar proportion or a slight excess of p carboxybenzene sulfonylazide and the ss keto ester of formula VI in the presence of dn inert organic solvent such as acetonitrile, dimethylformamide, methylene chloride and the like, and of a tertiary organic nitrogen base. .The temperature of the reaction is generally comprised between 100C and 300C and preferably between 50C and room temperature. Finally,decomposition of the ester VII with a catalytic amount of Rh2 OAc 4, by heating the catalyst first and then slowly adding the diazo VII solution thereto, gives the bicyclic keto ester II in almost quantitative yield. The desired keto ester II is isolated and, if desired, purified, by conventional procedures readily apparent to any skilled chemist.In their turn, the azetidin ethanol derivatives of formula IV, are prepared by either of the two different methods described in our copending EuropeanPatent Application No.82101463.6 filed on February 26,1982 having the title New291actam acetic acid derivatives, the process for preparing them, their use as intermediates for l azabicyclo 3.2.0 hept 2 ene antibiotics , which are incorporated herein by reference. Briefly, the two methods are schematically reported in the following Charts III and IV. CHART IIIEMI12.1 CHART IVEMI13.1 EMI13.2 EMI13.3 EMI13.4 According to Chart III, the enol acetate of a trans 4 substituted 2 buten l al is reacted with chiorosulfonyl isocyanate to give the 2 azetidone X which is then submitted to reductive hydrolysis affording the 2 azetidinone XI in very high yields.The azetidinone XI is then submitted to hydrogenation followed by deacetylation yielding the desired azetidinyl ethanol IV . More particularly, the formation of the enol acetate IX is achieved by reacting the aldehyde VIII with acetic anhydride in the presence of an organic or inorganic mild base such as a tertiary amine, or an alkali metal carbonate, and optionally, but not preferably, in the presence of an inert organic. solvent. The reaction proceeds. smoothly at room temperature, however sometimes it may be useful to heat the reaction mixture in order to speed up the reaction.Alternatively, the enol acetate IX may be prepared by reacting the trans 4 substituted 2 buten 1 al with isopropenyl. acetate in the presence of catalytic amounts of p toluenesulfonic acid and cupric acetate.The second step, i.e. the 2 2 cyclo addition of chlorosulfonyl isocyanate to the enol acetate, is. carried out in an inert organic solvent such as lower alkyl ethers, aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, halogenated hydrocarbons, nitromethane, acetonitrile and the like, under inert atmosphere and keeping the temperature in the range of 200C 50C. This reaction may either be carried out in batch or, more advantageously, as a continuous processThe organic solution containing the chlorosulfonyl derivative is submitted to reductive hydrolysis conditions by treatment with water buffered at a pH of about 6 8 containing a water soluble reducing agent such as sodium sulfite.The hydrogenation of XI may be carried out in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst such as for instance Platinum or Palladium, preferably adsorbed on a carbon or asbestos inert carrier, or Nickel Raney, at a temperature of from 20 to 60 C, under a pressure ranging from the normal pressure to about 20 atm. Preferably, the reduction is carried out at room temperature and under a pressure of about 3 atmospheres using a palladium on. carbon catalyst. Solvents which may suitably be employed. in this step are those commonly employed in hydrogenation reactions such as for instance ethyl acetate, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, alcohols and the like.. Finally, desacetylation to the alcohol IV occurs with very high yields by treatment with methanol containing a base such as sodium methoxide or potassium carbonate or cyanide.The six. step synthesis reported in Chart IV begins with the base catalyzed addition of benz.yl or substituted benzyl alcohol to methyl acrylate to give the 3 benzyloxy propionic acid methyl ester XII wherein R1 may represent hydrogen, lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, or nitro.The addition is carried out in the presence of an inert organic solvent which does not interfere with the reaction course, such as for instance benzene, toluene, xylene, and the like, using an alkali metal lower alkoxide or hydride or a tri lower alkyl phosphine as the basic catalyst. Once the addition reaction is completed, saponification of the ester XII with aqueous sodium or potassium hydroxide. may be carried out directly on the reaction mixture deriving from the addition reaction, without separation of the ester XII being required.3 Benzyloxypropionic acid which forms is easily recovered from the reaction mixture by means of conventional procedures which involve acidification of the aqueous phase and extraction with a suitable organic solvent which is then boiled off. Reaction of the obtained 3 benzyloxypropionic acid with a halogenating agent, typically thionyl chloride, in the. presence of a catalytic amount of. dimethylformamide then affords the 3 benzyloxypropanoyl halide XIII wherein R1 is as defined above and X is chlorine or bromine.Condensation of the 3 benzyloxypropanoyl halide XIII with the magnesium salt of a malonic acid. monolower alkyl ester derivative, obtained by treating a malonic acid monolower alkyl ester derivativeEMI16.1 with a lower alkyl magnesium halide, yields the ketoester XIV . The formation of the magnesium salt is achieved by contacting the malonic acid monolower alkyl ester derivative with the Grignard reagent R MgX wherein R is a lower alkyl group and X is chlorine, bromine or iodine in the presence of an inert organic solvent selected from those commonly employed in the Grignard reactions.Once the salt is formed, 3 benzyloxypropanoyl halide is gradually added while keeping the temperature between about 100C and the room value. By pouring the reaction mixture in aqueous mineral acids, extracting with an organic solvent immiscible with water, and evaporating off the extracting solvent, the keto ester XIV is recovered. If desired, the raw product XIV thus obtained may be purified by means of the usual techniques or it can be used as such in the reductive amination step that leads to the amine derivative XV .In this reductive amination, the carbonyl compound XIV is treated with a large excess of ammonia, op tionally in the form of its acetate, in the presence of a suitable reducing agent.Sodium cyanoborohydride is a particularly preferred reducing agent, however. other reducing agents can be used instead of. sodium cyanoborohydride, among them hydrogen and. a hydrogenation catalyst and sodium borohydride. The reaction which proceeds smoothly at room temperature and in alcoholic solvents, is preferably carried out at a pH of about 4.5 6.0 for instance by addition of glacial acetic acid. Acidification of the reaction mixture with concentrated hydrochloric acid, filtration of the ammonium chloride which separates, and concentration of the filtrate to dryness affords a crude residue from which the compound XV may be recovered by conventional purification procedures which are entirely familiar to any skilled chemist.Conversion of the amine derivative XV to the lactam XVI is achieved by treating the amine XV with at least two equivalents, and preferably three equivalents, of a Grignari reagent, R MgX , wherein R is a lower alkyl group and X is chlorine, bromine or iodine, or a lithium reagent R Li wherein Rf stands for an alkyl, alkenyl or aryl group. The reaction is carried out in an inert, organic solvent such as for instance ethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, ben zene, toluene, xylene and the like, and generally takes from 2 to 4 hours to be completed. The reactants are brought into contact at low temperature, preferably comprised between 30 and 5 C, and most preferably between 5 and 5 C, then the reaction proceeds at room temperature. Once the reaction is complete, diluted mineral acid is added at low temperature to give a final acid pH, preferably a final pH of about. 3, and the ss lactam XVI is extracted with a suitable organic solvent immiscible with water. The compound XVI which is recovered by evaporating off the extracting solvent may then be purified by con ventional. procedures such as fractional distillation or chromatography or both techniques. Finally catalytic debenzylation of thev3 lactam XVI , carried out according to the usual procedures known in chemistry, gives the alcohol IV . Preferably depro tection is achieved by using hydrogen and a hydrogena tion catalyst, such as palladium adsorbed on carbon, in acetic acid and in the presence of a catalytic amount of a strang acid such as trifluoroacetic, sulfuric or hydrochloric acid. All the reaction steps outlined in Charts I and II proceed with retention of the configuration of the carbon atoms numbered 5 and 6 in the 4 lactam structureEMI19.1 Thus, when starting from the trans or cis racemates of the alcohol IV or acid V , the trans or cis, racemates of the end product I are obtained, and when starting from a single trans or cis enantiomer of the alcohol IVY or acid V , one of the trans or cis enantiomer I is obtained wherein the hydrogen atoms at the 5 and 6 positions have the same absolute configuration of the carbon atoms indicated with 5 and 6 in the starting alcohol. or acid.Separation of the cis trans mixture into the couples of cis and trans isomers is generally carried out at the z2 lactam enol acetate XI stage, when the process described in Chart III is employed for preparing the alcohol IV or at the acid V stage when the couples of cis and trans isomers are s.eparated by crystallization from ethyl acetate.Moreover, when a single cis or trans enantiomer is desired, the cis or trans racemate of the acid V thus obtained, is then separated into the single optically active components by means of conventional procedures known in chemistry to this purposes, which involve reaction with an optically active base, separation of the diastereoisomeric salts which form b fractional crystallization or preparative HPLC, and separate restoration of the free acids. Among the optically active bases which may suitably be employed in this separation, there are oxyphene, dehydroabiethylamine, brucine, rosine, cinconine, efn conidine,. quinine, ephedrine and the like. Alternativelly, differential absorption techniques, using column packed with chirps absorbents, may suitably be employed in this separation.The reactionParts of the startingJ5 ketoester, i.e., the cysteamine derivatives. of formulaEMI20.1 wherein R is hydrogen which are generally novel compounds, can be easily prepared by the method outlined in the following Chart V CHART VEMI20.2 Briefly the above method consists in acylating anoQamino heterocyclic compound with a suitable acylating agent of formulaEMI20.3 wherein R2 is a protecting group of the nction which can be easily removed under the conditions employed in step B for the reduction of the amidic carbonyl group typicallyEMI20.4 group, and X represents a chlorine or bromine atom or a hydroxy group, and then reducing the amidic carbonyl group and simulta fleously splitting off the R2 blocking group.As for the acylation step, the reaction is carried out in the presence of a polar aprotic organic solvent such as methylene chloride, chloroform, dimethylsulfoxide, tetrahydrofuran and the like solvents, using equimolar amounts of the two reactants or a slight excess of the C aminoheterocyclic compound.When X represents a hydroxy group, the reaction is made to proceed in good yields at room temperature by the use of coupling agents such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimideN,N carbonyldiimidazole and the like agents, and preferably dicyclohexylcarbodiimide.When an acyl halide is employed X is chlorine or bromine , the reaction is carried out in the presence of a hydrogen halide acceptor agent to block the hydrohalid acid which forms during the reaction. Among the suitable hydrogen halide acceptor, tertiary organic nitrogen bases, such as triethylamine, diisopropylethyl amine, pyridine, picoline and the like, are preferred.When an acyl halide is employed, owing to the higher reactivity of this species, the reaction condition must be more carefully controlled. In particular, when using an acyl halide, the temperature of the reaction is generally kept between about 100C and 10 C and preferably in the range 0 5OC. The intermediate substituted mercaptoacetylamino heterocycle is then recovered by the usual procedures and converted into the desired ethanethiol derivative through reduction of the amidic carbonyl group and of the thiol protecting group.The reductive step is carried out with ThiAlH4 or by catalytic hydrogenation, and preferably with LiAlH4 because high temperatures and pressure are generally required for the catalytic hydrogenation.In particular, reduction with LiAlH4 is easily carried out by mixing the intermediate substituted mercaptoacetylamino heterocycle dissolved in an anhydrous inert organic solvent, typically tetrahydrofuran, with a 3 fold molar amount and preferably a slight excess over the 3 fold amount of the reducing agent suspended in the same solvent. The reaction which smoothly proceeds at temperatures which are initially low, generally comprised between 10 C and 5 C, and then increase to room temperature, takes from 1 2 to 3 hours to be complete.The excess of reducing agent is then decomposed by the addition of diluted mineral acids and the obtained cysteamine derivative is recovered from the reaction mixture by the usual methods which are entirely familiar to the skilled chemist. When for the reasons seen above, it is necessary to protect the amino group, the cysteamine derivative obtained according to the reaction scheme reported in Chart V, is reacted with at least a double molar amount of a suitable protective agent to give the corresponding compound wherein both the mercapto and the amino groups are protected. Then the free thiol group is restored by selective removal of the mercapto protecting group with ammonia in methanol.Analogously, when in addition or alternatively to the amino group , other nucleophilic groups present in the molecule must be protected, the same procedure can be followed but using the proper molar amount of the protective agent.The compounds of formula I according to the present invention as well as. their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and esters have valuable antibiotic activity against various gram positive and gram negative bacteria.The antibacterial spectrum in vitro of some representative compounds of the present invention is reported in Table I below.
