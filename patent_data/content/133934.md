Such characteristic are hereinbelow illustrated.Acute toxicity None of the test compounds caused lethal effects, both in short and long time, at the maximal tested doses, by oral administration in the rat 800 mg kg and by intraperitoneal administration in the mouse 400 mg kg . The animals were kept under observation during a period of 10 days after the treatment. As regards the intraperitoneal administration, a slight symptomatology of depressive kind was obser ved during the early 10 20 minutes, without showing ataxy, reduction of tonus nor body righting reflexes, tremor, convulsive phenomena.Pharmacologic activity The activity tests were carried out on male Spra gue Dawley rats weighing 200 20 g and on male Swiss mice weighing 26 3 g. The test compounds were administered orally by means of gastroesophagealtube, intheform of asuspen sion in a 10 ml kg mucilage of 5 gum arabic and intraperitoneally in the form of an aqueous suspen sion added with a few drops of Tween 80, in the con stant volume of 10 ml kg.Antiinflammatory activity carrageenin oedema in the rat Screening for anti inflammatory activity was carried out by using the carrageenin oedema test in the rat, based on procedure described by Winter et al. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol., 111, 544, 1962 .The compounds under test and the control ones were administered orally one hour before the injection of 0.1 ml of 1 carrageenin in the right paw of the animals. The volume of the paw was measured by means of a plethysmograph immediately before the injection and 2, 4 and 6 hours after. The results were expressed as percentage inhibi tion of the oedema in the treated animals in comparison with the control animals, at the time of the maximum oedema development fourth hour after the carrageenin injection . The results are set out in Table 2. All the tested compounds, at the oral dose of 100 ml kg, exhibited an antiinflammatory activity the amount of the anti oedema effect found for the more active compounds, turned out on the whole high er, at equiponderant doses, than that of Acetylsali cylic acid ASA comparable to that of mephenamic acid MFA and slightly lower than that of Indomethacin INDO . The more active compounds of the se ries, in decreasing order, were HA 36 HA 32 HA 34 HA 38 HA 37 HA 33.

J. Pharmacol. 9, 220, 1954. This method is ba sed upon the administration of the compounds by the intraperitoneal route and the estimate of the percen tage of animals which stood for 10 seconds an hemosta tic clip placed at the base of the finch, without turning out. Those animals which during preliminary tests showed a normal reaction not higher than 4 seconds were employed for this test. The test was carried out 15, 30, 60 and 120 minutes after the pharmacologic treatment. None of the compounds under test showed to possess central analgesic activity,up to doses of 50 mg kg i.p.b Writhing test in rat The analgesic activity of the compounds of the present invention was measured by the writhing test as described by Siegmund et al. Soc. Exp.Biol. Med., 97, 729, 1957 . The test compounds we re administered orally, by gastric tube, 1 hour before intraperitoneal injection of phenylbenzoquinone 0.25 ml rat of a 5 ethanol 0.025 solution . Five minutes after the injection, the number of writhes exhibited by each rat was recorded, until the 15th minute. The obtained results are summarized in Table 3.All the test compound exhibit a marked analgesic action at oral doses of 5 and 0.5 mg kg. Compound HA 34 is the more active of the tested compounds. The analgesic action was lower than that of Indomethacin, but by far higher than that of Acetylsalicylic acid. Comparison with mephenamic acid revealed the marked superiority of the tested compounds, with the exception of compound HA 30 which was substan tially comparable to the reference compound.

The obtained results are reported in Table 4. At the oral dose of 10 mg kg the HA 40 and HA 31 derivatives, as well as acetylsalicylic and mephenamic acids, did not display valuable anti exudating properties.

The analgesic effect was determined by the number of writhes of the abdomen recorded during 10 minutes from 5 to 15 minutes after the phenylbenzo quinone injection . Indomethacin and Piroxicam were used as the control drugs. The results are listed in Tables 6 and 7.HA 34 administeredl orally 1 hour before the test, has an ED50 of 1 mg kg.

HA 34 was administered 30 min.before the injection of carrageenin, and 6 hours after it. The experiment was carried out on male Sprague Dawley rats, anestethized with ethyl urethane, which were subjected, in their right pleural cavity, to injection of 1.5 ml of air and then 0.1 ml of a 1 carrageenin solution, in sterile normal saline, according to the procedure by Van Armann et al. J. Pharmac. Exp. Ther., 150, 328, 1965 . Indometha cin and Piroxicam were employed as the control drugs, under the same conditions. 18 Hours after the intrapleuric carrageenin injec tion, the animals were killed by means of ether inhalation, and the pleuric exudate was collected and measured. The results are reported in Table 9. HA 34, at the tested doses, exhibits a significant inhibiting action on the pleuric exudative rea ction induced by carrageenin. Such action is comparable to that of Piroxicam and lower than that of Indomethacin.
