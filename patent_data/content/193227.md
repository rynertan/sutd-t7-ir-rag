## Description
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of a pharmaceutically active compound in a stereospecific form of the formula R₁ O CH₂ CHOH CH₂ NH R₂ I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, like an acid addition salt, and or a compound in a stereospecific form of the formula It is commonly known that a lot of biologically active compounds exist as a mixture of stereoisomers. Most frequently these mixtures are used as such in agricultural and pharmaceutical applications. The major reason is that the separation costs still exceed the potential advantage of increase in activity. Usually the required biological activity resides in one stereoisomer so that at best the potency of the mixture is reduced to half. However it is apparent that modern pharmacologists are becoming increasingly aware of other implications of administering mixtures wherein one or more stereoisomers are regarded as an impurity that may not have the desired therapeutic effect but may well have other unwanted physiological effects including toxicity. Some examples are cited to illustrate the association of biological activity with single stereoisomers. Within the pharmaceutical area most of the beta adrenergic blocking agents are sold as mixtures although the activity resides in one stereoisomer. In one instance a drug known as labetalol has a combined alpha adrenergic blocking and beta adrenergic blocking action that has been shown to be attributed to two separate pairs of isomers from the mixture of four. N. Toda et al. reported in J.Pharmacol.Exp.Ther. Current routes to single stereoisomer beta blockers generally involve chemical resolutions or rather lengthy chemical syntheses from stereomeric precursors which are for example described in US patent 4,408,063 and in J.Org.Chem. The ability of micro organisms to convert stereospecifically short chain alkenes C₁ C₄ into their corresponding epoxyalkanes in a gas solid or in a two liquid phase bio reactor is demonstrated by J. Tramper et al. 3rd European Congress on Biotechnology, München, 10 14 September 1984 . Another example of the microbiological preparation of epoxyalkanes is disclosed in the U.S. patent 4,106,986 describing the conversion of straight chain 1 alkenes C₁ C₂₀ into 1,2 epoxyalkanes. In the European patent application 0099609 examples are given of the conversion of propane and 1 octene into their corresponding epoxyalkanes. However, the conversion of substituted alkenes, such as an ether compound III , can in no way be deduced from these known processes, which are only applicable to straight or sometimes branched alkenes. As a result of extensive research and experimentation an improved synthesis has now surprisingly been found for the preparation of particularly the More specifically the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of a pharmaceutically active compound in a stereospecific form of the formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, like an acid addition salt, and or a compound in a stereospecific form of formula II , wherein R₁ is an optionally substituted aryl group including a phenyl or naphthyl group optionally included in a heterocyclic ring system, which is optionally substituted, or is a heteroaromatic 5 or 6 membered ring containing in addition to carbon, one or more atoms selected from nitrogen, sulphur and oxygen, this ring being optionally substituted, and wherein R₂ is an alkyl group of 2 to 6 carbon atoms, this alkyl group being optionally substituted, which comprises subjecting a compound of the formula III to the action of a micro organism having the ability for stereoselective epoxidation of compound III into compound II , having at least 80 by weight the More preferably R₁ is a 2 tolyl, 3 tolyl, 2,3 dimethylphenyl, 2 chloro 5 methylphenyl, 2 allylphenyl, 2 allyloxyphenyl, 2 cyclopropylphenyl, 2 cyclohexylphenyl, 2 cyclopentylphenyl, 2 cyanophenyl, 2 methoxyphenyl, 2 methylthiophenyl, 2 tetrahydrofuran 2 yl methoxyphenyl, 4 acetamidophenyl, 4 carbazolyl, 4 carbamoylmethylphenyl, 4 2 methylformylamino ethyl phenyl, 2 acetyl 4 butyramidophenyl, 1 naphthyl, phenyl, 4 3 cyclohexylureido phenyl, 5,6 dihydro 1 naphthyl, 5,8 dihydro 1 naphthyl, 5,6,7,8 tetrahydro 5 oxo 1 naphthyl, 5,8 ethano 5,6,7,8 tetrahydro 1 naphthyl, 2,3 dihydro 1H inden 4 yl, 1H inden 4 yl, 1H inden 7 yl, 1H indol 4 yl, 5 methyl 8 coumarinyl, 8 thiochromanyl, 4 morpholino 1,2,5 thiadiozol 3 yl, 5,6,7,8 tetrahydro cis 6,7 dihydroxy 1 naphthyl, 4 2 methoxyethyl phenyl, 4 2 methoxyethoxy phenyl, 2 acetyl benzofuran 7 yl, 2,5 dichlorophenyl, 2 2 propenyloxy phenyl, 3,4 dihydrocarbostyril 5 yl, 2 acetyl 4 3,3 diethylureido phenyl, 4 2 cyclopropylmethoxy ethyl phenyl, 2 methyl 1H indol 4 yl, 4 acetoxy 2,3,5 trimethyl phenyl, 2 phenoxyphenyl, 2 thiazolyloxy, 2,2,5,7,8 pentamethylchroman 6 yl, 2 N beta hydroxyethylcarbamoylmethoxy phenyl or 2 N methylcarbamoylmethoxy phenyl group. Preferably the processes of the present invention are carried out, starting with a compound III wherein R₁ represents 4 2 methoxyethyl phenyl, 2 allyloxyphenyl, 4 carbamoylmethylphenyl, 1 naphthyl, phenyl and more preferably with a compound wherein R1 represents 4 2 methoxyethyl phenyl. In a preferred embodiment, the process is carried out in such a way by selecting micro organisms that at least 90 by weight of the With the term suitable micro organisms is meant for example bacteria belonging to the genera Rhodococcus, Mycobacterium, Nocardia and Pseudomonas. The micro organisms are optionally immobilized with polymer gel. The micro organisms for the epoxidation of 4 2 methoxyethyl phenylallyl ether include cultures of species The micro organisms for the epoxidation of phenylallyl ether include a culture of the species The micro organisms for the epoxidation of 4 allyloxy phenylacetamide include a culture of the species In practising the preferred embodiment of the process of the present invention, a micro organism having the ability to convert 4 2 methoxyethyl phenylallyl ether into 4 2 methoxyethyl phenylglycidyl ether having at least 90 by weight the The microorganisms used in the present invention showing the epoxidation activity, have to be cultured for about 0.5 to 10 days, whereafter the cells are suspended in a liquid nutrient medium, preferably a minimal liquid nutrient medium, and compound III is subjected to the action of the cells. After the abovementioned cultivation for about 0.5 to 10 days the cells may be isolated from the culturing medium before suspending the cells in the minimal liquid nutrient medium. To grow the micro organisms used for the stereo selective epoxidation of compound III , ordinary culture mediums containing an assimilable carbon source for example glucose, lactate, hydrocarbons like tetradecane C₁₄ , etc. , a nitrogen source for example ammonium sulphate, ammonium nitrate, ammonium chloride, etc. , with an agent for an organic nutrient source for example yeast extract, malt extract, peptone, meat extract, etc. and an inorganic nutrient source for example phosphate, magnesium, potassium, zinc, iron and other metals in trace amounts may be used. Optionally an inducer for example diethoxymethane is added to the culture medium. A temperature between 0 and 45 C and a pH between 3.5 and 9 is maintained during the growth of the micro organisms. Preferably the micro organisms are grown at a temperature between 20 and 37 C and at a pH between 5 and 8. The aerobic conditions required during the growth of the micro organisms can be provided according to any of the well established procedures, provided that the supply of oxygen is sufficient to meet the metabolic requirement of the micro organisms. This is most conveniently achieved by supplying a gaseous oxygen, preferably in the form of air. During the conversion of compound III into compound II the micro organisms might be in a growing stage using an abovementioned ordinary culture medium. The microorganisms may be supplemented with a cosubstrate. Preferably during the conversion of compound III into compound II , the micro organisms can be held in a substantially non growing stage using a minimal culture medium. As minimal culture medium, an ordinary culture medium may be used containing an assimilable carbon source when required for example glucose, lactate, hydrocarbons like tetradecane C₁₄ , etc. , a nitrogen source when required for example ammonium sulphate, ammonium nitrate, ammonium chloride, etc. , with an agent for an organic nutrient source when required for example yeast extract, malt extract, peptone, meat extract etc. and an inorganic nutrient source when required for example phosphate, magnesium, potassium, zinc, iron and other metals in trace amounts . The micro organisms can be kept in the non growing stage for example under exclusion of the assimilable carbon source or under exclusion of the nitrogen source. A temperature between 0 and 45 C and a pH between 3.5 and 9 is maintained during this stage. Preferably the micro organisms are kept at a temperature between 20 and 37 C and a pH between 5 and 8. The aerobic conditions required during this stage can be provided according to the abovementioned procedures, provided that the supply of oxygen is sufficient to meet the metabolic requirement of the micro organisms but also to convert compound III into compound II . The compound II produced by the micro organisms as mentioned above, can be recovered and purified according to any of the well established procedures. Especially mixtures with a predominant amount of the compound R₁ O CH₂ CHOH CH₂ NH R₂ can be advantageously used in pharmaceutical products.

The present invention will be futher described with reference to Examples in conjunction with the accompanying Figures, without restricting the scope of the present invention to these Examples. Approximately half the biomass from a 72 h culture of The product, 4 2 methoxyethyl phenylglycidyl ether, appeared after 48h incubation and increased until 96h when the level of epoxide was approximately 15 of the remaining 4 2 methoxyethyl phenylallyl ether. In order to accumulate sufficient quantities of 4 2 methoxyethyl phenylglycidyl ether, the culture broth from 10 x 50 ml and 5 x 500 ml incubations conditions as described above was extracted with methylene chloride 350 ml . The extract was dried over Na₂SO₄, the solvent evaporated, and the epoxide purified on silica gel using a hexane ether gradient epoxide eluted with 30 ether to give 4 2 methoxyethyl phenylglycidyl ether 353 mg having α 8.11 c 0.95, ethanol . Optical purity of 4 2 methoxyethyl phenylglycidyl ether was investigated using pmr in the presence of europium shift reagent Eu hfc 3 see Figure 1 . On addition of the shift reagent, the envelope of signals from each of the geminal protons labelled a and b in the chemically synthesised 4 2 methoxyethyl phenylglycidyl ether Figure 1A shifted downfield and each was split into two envelopes of signals of equal intensity Figure 1B, a b . However, under the same conditions, only one envelope of signals was detectable from each of the geminal protons in the microbially produced 4 2 methoxyethyl phenylglycidyl ether Figure 1C, a b . Thus, the optical purity of the 4 2 methoxyethyl phenylglycidyl ether obtained by microbial epoxidation was determined to be 100 , within the experimental error of the pmr measurements. A solution of 4 2 methoxyethyl phenylglycidyl ether 290 mg. see example I in dried ethanol 6.2 ml containing isopropylamine 1.84 ml was heated under reflux for 3 hours after which the solvents were removed by evaporation. The resulting oil was dissolved in methylene chloride 10 ml and extracted into 0.2N HCl 10ml which was then washed with methylene chloride 2 x 10 ml . The acid layer was made basic with 2N NaOH 3 ml and the product extraced into methylene chloride 10 ml . The methylene chloride extract was dried over Na₂SO₄ and the solvent evaporated to give a sticky solid. The product was recrystallized from hexane to give metopropol 260 mg , showing α 5.46 c 1.01, ethanol and m.p. 42 45 C. Metoprolol m.p. 49 51 C, prepared chemically, was, as expected optically inactive. The pmr and mass spectra of metoprolol Figures 2 3 and metoprolol, not shown , were consistent with the required structure, and were indistinguishable from the pmr spectrum of metoprolol m.p. 48.5 50.5 C extracted from a commercial sample of metoprolol tartrate. Optical purity of the metoprolol was determined by separation of its A suspension of Cell suspension 1100 ml was incubated with 4 2 methoxyethyl phenylallyl ether 3.3 g at 30 C., 220 rpm. After 24 h, the reaction mixture was extracted with methylene chloride 500 ml , the extract dried over Na₂SO₄, and the solvent evaporated to give an oil 2.67 g . Purification on silica gel as in Example I gave 4 2 methoxyethyl phenylglycidyl ether 930 mg with α 8.21 c 0.943, ethanol . Optical purity, as measured by pmr in the presence of europium shift reagent Eu hfc 3 as in Example I , was determined to be 100 within the experimental error of the pmr measurements. 4 2 methoxyethyl phenylglycidyl ether 694 mg was used method as in Example II to prepare metoprolol 579 mg m.p. 44 46 C with α 5.49 c 1.02, ethanol . Optical purity was determined to be 98 method as in Example II . The mother liquor was crystallised giving metoprolol 113 mg with an optical purity of 96 . Cell suspension 200 ml of 4 2 methoxyethyl phenylglycidyl ether 76 mg was used method as in Example II to prepare metoprolol 55 mg , m.p. 42 45 C, α 4.93 c 0.944, ethanol , with an optical purity of 98.8 as determined by HPLC of its S leucyl diastereomeric derivatives as in Example II . Evaporation of the mother liquor yielded metoprolol 17 mg of 95.2 optical purity. Cell suspension 200 ml of 4 2 methoxyethyl phenylglycidyl ether 214 mg was condensed with isopropylamine as in Example II to yield Metoprolol 146 mg m.p. 44 46 C with α 5.00 c 1.01, ethanol . Optical purity method as in Example II was determined to be 98 . Evaporation of the mother liquor yielded metoprolol 9 mg of 97.5 optical purity. Cell suspension 200 ml of 4 2 methoxyethyl phenylglycidyl ether 171 mg was reacted with isopropylamine method as in Example II to give metoprolol 154 mg m.p. 44 45 C with α 5.27 c 0.967, ethanol . Optical purity was determined to be 98.4 based of HPLC of the S leucyl diastereomeric derivatives as in Example II . Evaporation of the mother liquor gave metoprolol 6 mg of 92.2 optical purity. Mineral salts medium 50 ml containing Tween 80 0.05 ml , tetradecane 0.05 ml and 4 2 methoxyethyl phenylallyl ether 0.05 ml was inoculated with either In each case, peaks corresponding to 4 2 methoxyethyl phenylglycidyl ether were detected with conversions as follows Continuous culture conditions culture volume 2.7 litres, medium AM2 containing NH₄ ₂SO₄ 1.45 g l , H₃PO₄ 1.0 g l , MgSO₄.7H₂O 0.099 g l , CaCl₂.2H₂O 0.015 g l , TK₃ trace elements solution 2 ml l , 0.1 M FeSO₄.7H₂O 1 ml l . Carbon source ethylene at 25 ml min, air at 300 ml min, stirrer speed 280 rpm, temperature 28 C, pH 6.8, dilution rate 0.02 h ¹ µmax ca. 0.03 h ¹ . These conditions supported a biomass level of ca. 3.2 g l dry weight. Cells were generally concentrated before use by centrifugation followed by resuspension in spent medium . Phenylglycidyl ether was analysed by GC column and conditions as in previous Examples except temperature programme was 50 C 100 C at 10 C min. A 2.25 litre batch two phase system was used to produce phenylglycidyl ether. The transformation was carried out in a fermenter containing 750 ml cell suspension 6.9 g l dry weight and 1500 ml iso octane containing 2.5 v v phenylallyl ether Figure 4 . The epoxide was produced at a rate of 193 µmol h g dry weight 0.03 g h g dry weight and was isolated after 10 h by chromatography on silica gel then purified by distillation to give phenylglycidyl ether 750 mg . The pmr spectra and mass spectra of phenylglycidyl ether produced microbially were consistent with the required structure and identical to those of phenylglycidyl ether prepared chemically by the reaction of phenylallyl ether with m chloroperbenzoic acid. The phenylglycidyl ether gave a specific rotation of α 11.38 c 1.09, ethanol . Optical purity was investigated using pmr in the presence of europium shift reagent Eu hfc 3, the same as in Example I. On addition of the shift reagent, the envelope of signals from each of the geminal protons in the chemically synthesised phenylglycidyl ether shifted downfield and were each split into two envelopes of signals of equal intensity, whereas the envelope of signals from the geminal protons in microbially produced phenylglycidyl ether were split in the ratio 6.7 1. This result indicates that 87 of the molecules are in one enantiomeric form, which implies an optical purity of 74 . Analysis of a mixture of epoxides from microbial and chemical sources gave signal ratios which confirmed that 90 of the phenylglycidyl ether was in one enantiomeric form, equivalent to an optical purity of 80 . Further confirmation of the optical purity of the phenylglycidyl ether was established following its conversion into 1 isopropylamino 3 phenoxy 2 propanol. phenylglycidyl ether 300 mg was reacted with isopropylamine as in Example II to give 1 isopropylamino 3 phenoxy 2 propanol 125 mg with α 6.51 c 0.984, ethanol , m.p. 42 44 C. 1 Isopropyl amino 3 phenoxy 2 propanol was similarly synthesised from phenylglycidyl ether. The pmr and mass spectra of 1 isopropylamino 3 phenoxy 2 propanol Figures 5 6 and 1 isopropylamino 3 phenoxy 2 propanol not shown were consistent with the required structure. Optical purity was measured by HPLC of the corresponding S leucyl diastereomeric derivatives as in Example II and determined to be 80 . A suspension of Cell suspension 1100 ml was incubated with 4 allyloxy phenylacetamide 3.2 g added as a 10 ball milled suspension in water containing 5 Tween 80 , in eleven 2.5 litre conical flasks on an orbital shaker at 30 C. After 72 hours, the incubation mixture was extracted with methylene chloride 1000 ml , the solvent was dried and evaporated, after which the residue was recrystallized from acetone to give 2.27 g white crystalline material whose composition was 90 4 allyloxy phenylacetamide and 10 4 2,3 epoxypropyloxy phenylacetamide as determined by HPLC column Lichrosorb RP8 10 µm 25 cm x 1 4 o.d., 4.9 mm i.d., mobile phase 40 acetonitrile in water at 2 ml min, UV. detection . The crystallized extract, containing approximately 230 mg 4 2,3 epoxy propyloxy phenylacetamide, was dissolved in dry ethanol 40 ml , then heated under reflux with isopropylamine 2.5 ml for 5 hours, after which the excess solvent was evaporated. The residu was dissolved in methylene chloride 50 ml and extracted with 3 x 50 ml 0.2N HCl. The acid layers were combined, washed with methylene chloride, then made basic with 5N NaOH. The white precipitate which was formed, was extracted into methylene chloride 3 x 100 ml , the extract was dried over Na₂SO₄, then the solvent was evaporated to give a white solid which was recrystallized from hexane ethyl acetate giving Atenolol 76 mg α 3.9 c 1. 01, EtOH , m.p. 146 148 C, ¹H NMR CHCl₃ 360 MHz spectrum delta 1.1 d, 6H, Optical purity of the Atenolol was determined by separation of its di benzoyl tartaric acid monoester diastereomeric derivatives on a reverse phase HPLC column Lichrosorb RP8 10 µm 25 cm x 1 4 o.d., 4.9 mm i.d., mobile phase 2 acetic acid to pH 3.7 with NH₃ 50 50 methanol at 1.5 ml min. . Derivatization was achieved by reacting or Atenolol with R,R O,O dibenzoyltartaric anhydride as described by W. Linder et al in J. Chrom. 316, p. 605 616 1984 . Analysis of a sample derived from Atenolol resulted in the formation of two diastereomer peaks of near equal intensity, whereas the sample derived from the Atenolol resulted in the formation of two peaks with intensity ratio 1.5 98.5, equivalent to an optical purity of 97.0 . A suspension of Cell suspension 10 ml, 12.6 g l dry wt. was incubated at 30 C with 0.5 ml of a 90 mg ml ball milled and sonicated suspension of 4 allyloxy phenyl acetamide which also contained 50 mg ml tween 80 in a 250 ml stoppered conical flask on an orbital incubator. Samples 1 ml were extracted into methylene chloride 2 ml , the solvent was evaporated, then the residue was redissolved in dimethylformamide prior to analysis by HPLC conditions as for analysis of 4 2,3 epoxypropyloxy phenylacetamide in example IX . The level of 4 2,3 epoxypropyloxy pheny acetamide in the incubation mixture reached 0.9 g l and 1.3 g l after 3 hours and 24 hours respectively. Cell suspensions of Cell suspension 10 ml was incubated with 0.5 ml of a 10 ball milled aqueous suspension of 4 allyloxy phenylacetamide which also contained 5 tween 80 at 30 C in stoppered 250 ml conical flasks on an orbital incubator. After 24 hours the incubation mixtures were extracted into methylene chloride and found to contain 4 2,3 epoxypropyloxy phenyl acetamide at concentrations as follows A suspension of Cell suspension 10 ml, dry wt. 12.6 g l, contained in a 250 ml conical flask was incubated with 4 2 methoxyethyl phenylallyl ether 250 µl and glucose 50 mg at 37 C on an orbital shaker. Formation of 4 2 methoxyethyl phenylglycidyl ether was monitored by gas chromatography after extraction into methylene chloride conditions as described in previous examples .
