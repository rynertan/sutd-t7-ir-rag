# METHOD FOR RAPID STRENGTH DEVELOPMENT IN COMPACTING GLASS BATCH MATERIALS

## Abstract
An improved process for producing an acceleration in strength for glass batch materials after they have been compacted as in the form of briquettes. The method comprises forming an intimate mixture of glass forming materials, admixing therein an alkali metal salt selected from the group consisting of sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, and sodium sulfate adding between about 4 to about 10 weight percent water to hydrate said alkali metal salt and moisten said glass forming material, compacting said moistened materials to individual units, and subjecting the units after their formation to cooling air currents to maintain said freshly formed units at a temperature 90 F., or below for 30 minutes or less.
