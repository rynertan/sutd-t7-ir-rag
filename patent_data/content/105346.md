## Description
The present invention relates to vaccines and antigens for infectious disease and, more specifically, to antigens useful in the diagnosis and treatment of foot and mouth disease. Foot and mouth disease is a highly contagious disease of great economic importance, afflicting primarily cloven hoofed animals. The mortality directly attributable to foot and mouth disease is comparatively low, generally, but in young animals the mortality can be quite high. Of greater economic importance, the disease is so debilitating that infected animals cannot be raised and fed economically . The only recognized effective procedure for eliminating the infection once it has been discovered is to destroy all infected animals, disinfect all premises which have been occupied by the animals, and decompose the carcasses in quicklime. Since the infection spreads extremely rapidly, the economic foundation of entire communities or regions can be destroyed by one major outbreak of foot and mouth disease. Vaccines have been produced which immunize against foot and mouth disease, primarily, by inactivation or attenuation of the virus. Such vaccines have been found to be effective in some measure, but outbreaks of foot and mouth disease have been linked to vaccines in which the virus was incompletely inactivated or insufficiently attenuated as well. Infections have also been traced to the escape of virus from facilities devoted to research on foot and mouth disease or to production of foot and mouth disease vaccines. Foot and mouth disease FMD is caused by a Picornavirus of the genus aphthovirus. There are several viral serotypes of foot and mouth disease virus FMDV , the most common of which are identified by the serotype designations A, O and C, and less common identified as SAT 1, SAT 2, SAT 3 and ASIA 1. Among these serotypes, several subtypes and subtype strains have also been identified. The following are among the identified subtypes and subtype strains FMDV A, subtype 10, strain 61 and subtype 12, strains 119, USA and Pirbright FMDV 0, subtype 1, strain Kaufbeuren and FMDV C, subtype 3, strain Indaial. FMDV has been described in some detail see, for example, H.L. Backrach, in The whole VP₃ protein when used to inoculate swine elicited a neutralizing anti body response and protected both swine and cattle from infection. J. Laporte, et al., It is noted that the literature in this field utilizes the same names to refer to different capsid proteins. Thus, the above mentioned workers in the United States typically refer to the capsid protein referred to herein and in Europe as VP₁, as the VP₃ capsid. There is agreement, however, that the capsid protein referred to herein as VP₁, and referred to by others as VP₃, is the immunologically active capsid protein. Recombinant DNA molecules and processes for producing peptides with the specificity of foot and mouth disease viral antigens are described in United Kingdom Patent Application GB 2,079,288A, 20 Jan. 1982. See also Boothroyd et al, K. Strohmaier et al., Proc. 5th Int. Congress Virology, Strasbourg, 1981, poster session, have digested the VP₁ protein denominated VP A full paper by Strohmaier et al., In the past antigens have been obtained in several fashions, including derivation from natural materials, coupling of a hapten to a carrier, and by recombinant DNA technology. Sela, et al., Antigens derived from natural materials are the countless number of known antigens which occur naturally, such as blood group antigens, HLA antigens differentiation antigens, viral and bacterial antigens, and the like. Considerable effort has been expended over the last century in identifying and studying these antigens. Certain synthetic antigens have been prepared by coupling small molecules to carriers such as, for example, bovine serum albumin, thus producing antigens which will cause production of antibody to the coupled small molecule. The carrier molecule is necessary because the small molecule itself would not be recognized by the immune system of the animal into which it was injected. This technique has also been employed in isolated instances to prepare antigens by coupling peptide fragments of known proteins to carriers, as described in the above referenced Sela et al. articles. While this hapten carrier technique has served the research community well in its investigations of the nature of the immune response, it has not been of significant use to produce antigens which would play a role in diagnostic or therapeutic modalities. The reasons for this deficiency are several. First, to choose and construct a useful antigenic determinant from a pathogen by this technique, one must determine the entire protein sequence of the pathogen to have a reasonable chance of success. Because of the difficulty of this task it has rarely, if ever, been done. Classically, vaccines are manufactured by introducing killed or attenuated organisms into the host along with suitable adjuvants to initiate the normal immune response to the organisms while, desirably, avoiding the pathogenic effects of the organism in the host. The approach suffers from the well known limitations in that it is rarely possible to avoid the pathogenic response because of the complexity of the vaccine which includes not only the antigenic determinant of interest but many related and unrelated deleterious materials, any number of which may, in some or all individuals, induce an undesirable reaction in the host. For example, vaccines produced in the classical way may include competing antigens which are detrimental to the desired immune response, antigens which include unrelated immune responses, nucleic acids from the organism or culture, endotoxins and constituents of unknown composition and source. These vaccines, generated from complex materials, inherently have a relatively high probability of inducing competing responses even from the antigen of interest. In addition, such known vaccines against FMDV must be kept refrigerated prior to use, and refrigeration in remote areas where the vaccines are used is often difficult to obtain. Recombinant DNA technology has opened new approaches to vaccine technology which does have the advantage that the manufacture begins with a monospecific gene however, much of this advantage is lost in actual production of antigen in Further, even though the desired protein may be produced, there is uncertainty as to whether or not it can be harvested, or whether it will be destroyed, in the process of Finally, even if it were possible, or became possible through advanced, though necessarily very expensive, techniques, to separate the desired protein from all other products of the It is also possible, using hybridoma technology, to produce antibodies to viral gene products. Basically, hybridoma technology allows one to begin with a complex mixture of antigens and to produce monospecific antibodies later in the process. In contrast, the present invention is the reverse process, in that it starts with the ultimate in high purity antigenic determinant and thus avoids the necessity for purification of the desired antigenic product. Hybridoma antibodies are known to be of low avidity and low binding constant, and therefore, have limited value. Ultimately, in hybridoma technology, one must rely on the production of the antibody by cells which are malignant, with all of the attendant concerns regarding separation techniques, purity and safety. Hybridoma production relies upon tissue culture or introduction into mice, with the obvious result that production is costly there is also inherent variability from lot to lot. In addition, it is difficult to make a hybrid to molecules which comprise only a small percentage of the complex mixture one must start with. Previous studies by Arnon et al., Nothwithstanding the availability of inactivated or attenuated virus vaccines against foot and mouth disease, there has remained a great economic and practical demand for, and great theoretical interest, in the development of a vaccine against foot and mouth disease which would be free of the risks which have heretofore attended the manufacture and handling of the FMDV which causes the disease. The availability of cloned viral proteins may well be a very significant step forward from the older and very risky approaches. However, the cloned viral protein vaccine approach also carried with it a number of inherent disadvantages, limitations and risks. Variations in the biosynthesis system itself may cause variation in expression of proteins, thus affecting purity, yields, potency, etc. of antigens. In addition, the presence of other proteins, and difficult and inefficient separations, suggest the likelihood that vaccines produced through the cloned viral protein route will not be monospecific. Thus, purity, potency, and safety are major concerns with products derived from this technology. Nothwithstanding that the general concept of preparing synthetic antigens, starting either from a known peptide sequence or from a genome have been described, and notwithstanding that the synthesis of peptides of suitable length for use in antigenic materials is now quite well known, there remains a very large area of antigen antibody technology which continues to defy predictabilty. While there are some guidelines and some suggestions as to possible antigenic sequences, the field remains largely a matter of speculation, and of trial and error. Even with the recognition that a long sequence may contain antigenicaly active constituents, there remains a great deal of uncertainty and speculation as to whether all or only part of the sequence is required for antigenicity, and whether or not a smaller portion of the sequence would be of greater or lesser antigenicity. A specific synthetic, antigenic peptide containing a sequence of about twenty amino acid residues is contemplated by the present invention. This antigenic peptide includes an amino acid residue sequence that corresponds substantially to a certain region of the antigenic FMDV capsid protein. That region is located at a distance equal to 60 to 75 percent of the total amino acid residue sequence length of the antigenic capsid protein as measured from the amino terminus thereof. This peptide, when linked to a keyhole limpet hemocyanin carrier as a conjugate and introduced in an effective amount as a vaccine into a host animal, is capable of inducing production of antibodies in the host that immunoreact with the FMDV and protect the host from infection caused by that virus. The peptide preferably has a net positive ionic charge, exclusive of ionic charges of terminal peptide amino and or carboxyl groups. In another embodiment, this invention contemplates a synthetic, antigenic peptide containing a sequence of about twenty amino acid residues corresponding substantially to an amino acid residue sequence from position 130 to 160 from the amino terminus of the FMDV VP₁ capsid protein, and more particularly, from positions 141 to 160 is disclosed. This peptide, when linked to a keyhole limpet hemocyanin carrier as a conjugate and introduced in an effective amount as a vaccine into an animal host, is capable of inducing production of antibodies in the host that immunoreact with the foot and mouth virus and protect the host from infection caused by that virus. The synthetic antigenic peptides of this invention can be used along with physiologically acceptable diluents such as water and or adjuvants in a vaccine that is capable of protecting animals from foot and mouth disease, or for raising antibodies useful in detecting the presence of antigenic proteins associated with foot and mouth disease. A preferred sequence of about twenty amino acid residues of the foot and mouth disease related synthetic peptide in the amino acid residue position region of 130 to 160 is selected from an amino acid residue sequence that corresponds substantially to the amino acid residues of the sequence, written from left to right and in a direction from amino terminus toward carboxy terminus, shown below wherein each of the amino acid residues, X, Y or Z shown in parentheses may individually replace the contiguous amino acid residue to the immediate left of the parentheses, The more particularly preferred foot and mouth disease related peptide amino acid sequence corresponding substantially to positions of 141 to 160 from the amino terminus commences at the amino terminus with the Val Ser or Gln or X residue at position 141 in the above sequence. Most particularly preferred, individual peptides are those corresponding substantially to amino acid residue sequences of foot and mouth disease viruses 1 Tübingen type O, subtype 1, strain Kaufbeuren, 2 type A, subtype 10, strain 61 and 3 type A, subtype 12, strain 119 at the positions of about 141 to about 160, taken from left to right as shown and in the direction from amino terminus to carboxy terminus, and are selected from the following respective sequences The present invention provides several benefits and advantages, particularly in the case of the use of peptides of this invention in vaccines against foot and mouth disease and in diagnostics for assaying for the presence of this disease or virus in animals, including man. Thus, one salient advantage is that the synthetic peptides can provide part of a vaccine that protects animals from foot and mouth disease. A particular benefit of the invention is that vaccines prepared using a synthetic peptide do not have to be refrigerated prior to administration in order to obtain efficacious vaccinations. Another advantage of the present invention is in the realm of diagnostics wherein antibodies in antisera raised to the synthetic peptide immunoreact with and can be used to detect the presence of antigenic proteins and antibodies associated with foot and mouth disease. Still further benefits and advantages will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the detailed description, examples and claims that follow. In the drawings forming a portion of this disclosure The present invention comprises the discovery that a particular, comparatively short, synthetic peptide sequence is, most unexpectedly and most suprisingly, extremely active antigenically. The synthetic peptide contains an amino acid residue sequence about 20 amino acid in length. The peptide s amino acid residue sequence at least corresponds substantially to an amino acid residue sequence of a region on the antigenic FMDV capsid protein that is located at a distance equal to 60 to 75 percent of the total amino acid residue sequence length of the antigenic capsid protein as measured from the amino terminus. The synthetic peptide contains a net zero to positive ionic charge, exclusive of ionic charges present due to the presence of terminal amino and or carboxyl groups. In addition, synthetic antigens including the peptide sequences described hereinafter are mono specific to the specific serotypes, subtypes and strains of foot and mouth disease virus, and are also poly specific, albeit to a lesser extent, to a plurality of the serotypes, subtypes and strains of that virus. In particular, it has been discovered, that a synthetic peptide containing about twenty amino acids corresponding substantially to the amino acid residue sequence of positions 130 to 160, and positions 141 to 160 especially, from the amino terminus of the FMDV VP₁ protein such as that from Tübingen type O, subtype 1, strain Kaufbeuren has much higher antigenic efficacy and activity than ever had been suggested or predicted from earlier studies. A peptide of this invention, alone, in straight chain or cyclic ring form, as a polymer having peptide units linked by oxidized cysteine residues of adjacent peptides, or as a conjugate linked to a carrier, is a potent immunologic reactor antigen for foot and mouth disease, as will be discussed in detail hereinafter. The phrases position 130 to position 160 and position 141 to position 160 from the amino terminus and similar phrases are used herein. Those amino acid residue postions are determined in relation to the reference VP₁ capsid protein of type O, subtype 1, strain Kaufbeuren FMDV. It is noted that some workers in this field such as Kleid et al. in EPO publication number 0 068 693 A2 have offset the positions of amino acid residues in the 130 160 region of the VP₁ VP₃, discussed hereinbefore capsid protein by one amino acid position number toward the carboxy terminus relative to the position numbers given herein due to the presence of an additional amino acid Val after Asp 53 in the sequence of the type C, subtype 3 VP₁ capsid, where the other capsids contain no amino acid residue. Consequently, the amino acid at a given position such as 140 herein appears as the amino acid at position 141 in the above mentioned EPO application. Thus, there is an art recognized difference of one or more amino acid positions when different workers report sequences of the same protein molecule. In addition, capsid proteins from some foot and mouth disease viruses contain no amino acid residue at one or more positions the 130 160 region relative to type VP₁ of type O, subtype 1, strain Kaufbeuren as is shown in Figure 1 and designated by the letters X , Y and Z in the sequence of Formula I, hereinbelow. In view of the presence of such deletions or omissions, some workers report amino acid positions as determined from the protein or a DNA molecule coding for that protein, without accounting for the deletions. Other workers illustrate the homologies between the VP₁ capsids by indicating amino acid deletions with hyphens, letters or other indicia and numbering the remaining amino acid residue positions as if the deleted residues were present, as is done herein. Thus, there is an additional, slight, art recognized variation in the reporting of amino acid positions. Several synthetic peptides are contemplated by this invention. Each of these synthetic peptides contains a sequence including about 20 amino acid residues in a sequence that corresponds substantially to an amino acid residue sequence of about the same length in the region from position 130 to position 160 of the VP₁ protein of FMDV. As has already been noted, there are several types, subtypes and strains of FMDV. Therefore, for convenience of reference, the peptide sequences described herein will be discussed with reference to the VP₁ protein from a particular type, subtype and strain namely Tübingen type O, subtype 1, strain Kaufbeuren of FMDV, also referred to herein as type O, subtype 1, strain Kaufbeuren and O1k. Thus, using the amino acid sequence of one particular FMDV protein as a reference, other useful peptide sequences are described which contain substituted or omitted amino acid residues at particular locations along the peptide chain. Peptide sequences from the VP₁ capsid protein of eight of FMD viruses at postions of 130 to 160 are shown in Figure 1, using the numbering system of the reference type O1k protein. Synthetic, preferably water soluble peptides each containing about 20 amino acids, having amino acid residue sequences that correspond substantially to the amino acid residue sequences shown in Figure 1 and meeting the unitary test condition hereinafter are contemplated as being within the scope of this invention. A preferred peptide having an amino acid residue sequence that corresponds substantially to amino acid residue positions of 130 to 160, taken from left to right and in the direction from amino terminus to carboxy terminus is shown in Formula I, below wherein each of amino acid residues, X, Y or Z in parentheses may independently replace the contiguous amino acid residue to the immediate left of the parentheses i.e., the amino acid residue closer to the amino terminus The more preferred sequence corresponding substantially to positions of 141 to 160 of the VP₁ capsid protein commences at the amino terminus with the Val Ser or Gln or X residue at position 141 in Formula I. Poly specificity and cross reactivity among types, subtypes and strains of the FMDV genus are improved by use of an antigenic peptide of this invention whose amino acid residue sequence corresponds to an amino acid residue sequence of at least more than one strain, and more preferably more than one subtype or serotype of the FMDV genus. The amino acid residue sequence of such a peptide may not correspond substantially to the amino acid residue sequence of any one virus, but may nevertheless, when inoculated as a vaccine into an animal host, induce production of antibodies that immunoreact with a plurality of virus types, subtypes or strains and protect the host from more than one of those viruses. A poly specific peptide whose amino acid residue sequence corresponds to an amino acid residue sequence of at least more than one strain of FMDV may have the amino acid residue sequence of Formula 1, above, in which one or more parenthesized amino acid residue, X, Y, or Z replaces the contiguous amino acid residue to the immediate left of the parentheses i.e. the contiguous amino acid residue toward the amino terminus. Substitutions and omissions in the region of amino acid residue positions 141 to 155 are preferred for obtaining poly specificity in a peptide having a single amino acid residue sequence. Such a poly specific peptide can be prepared and used in the same way as any other peptide of this invention. Most particularly preferred, individual peptides corresponding substantially to amino acid residue sequences of 1 Tübingen type O, subtype 1, strain Kaufbeuren, 2 type A, subtype 10, strain 61 and 3 type A, subtype 12, strain 119 at the positions of 141 to 160, taken from left to right in the direction from amino terminus to carboxy terminus, are represented by the following respective sequences The term corresponds substantially in its various grammatical forms is used herein and in the claims in relation to peptide sequences related to FMDV to mean the peptide sequence described plus or minus up to three amino acid residues at either or both of the amino and carboxy termini and containing only conservative substitutions in particular amino acid residues along the peptide sequence. The term conservative substitution as used above is meant to denote that one amino acid residue has been replaced by another, biologically similar residue. Examples of conservative substitutions include the substitution of one hydrophobic residue such as Ile, Val, Leu or Met for another, or the substitution of one polar residue for another such as between Arg and Lys, between Glu and Asp or between Gln and Asn, and the like. In some instances, the replacement of an ionic residue by an oppositely charged ionic residue such as Asp by Lys has been termed conservative in the art in that those ionic groups are thought to merely provide solubility assistance. In general, however, since the replacements discussed herein are on relatively short synthetic peptide antigens, as compared to a whole protein, replacement of an ionic residue by another ionic residue of opposite charge is considered herein to be radical replacement , as are replacements between nonionic and ionic residues, and bulky residues such as Phe, Tyr or Trp and less bulky residues such as Gly, Ile and Val. The terms nonionic and ionic residues are used herein in their usual sense to mean those amino acid residues that normally either bear no charge or normally bear a charge, respectively, at physiological pH values. Exemplary nonionic residues include Thr and Gln, while exemplary ionic residues include Arg and Asp. The above sequence shown in Formula 1 and the shorter, more preferred synthetic sequence corresponding substantially to positions 141 to 160 of the FMDV VP₁ capsid include a large number of individual peptides, each of which, when about 20 amino acid residues in length, is a peptide of this invention. For example, synthetic peptides prepared having an amino terminus beginning at position 141 of the capsid may start with an amino terminal Val, Ser or Gln residue. In addition, when the amino terminal amino acid residue position is represented by X, indicating the absence of the amino acid residue to the immediate left of the parentheses in Formula I, the peptide amino terminus may begin with the amino acid residues Pro, Gly or Y of capsid position 142, wherein Y independently denotes the absence of Pro and Gly so that the peptide amino terminus begins with the amino acid residue corresponding to position 143 of O1k, rather than the positions 141 or 142. Further examination of Formula 1 illustrates that the residue of capsid position 143 can be Asn or Z and thereby also be absent. Thus, a peptide whose sequence corresponds substantially to capsid positions 141 to 160 could begin at capsid position 144. Peptide sequences that correspond substantially to a described sequence may have plus or minus up to three amino terminus residues at either terminus. The above described peptide whose amino acid residue sequence actually begins at position 144 relative to the type O1k VP₁ capsid protein is among those whose sequences are minus up to three amino acid residues at either or both of the amino and carboxy termini... Exemplary peptides which are encompassed in the present invention are included in the 130 to 160 region of type O, subtype 1, strain Kaufbeuren and type A, subtype 12, strain 119 FMDV proteins expressed using the type O position numbering and denominated O1k and A12, respectively , and the corresponding regions of type C, SAT 1, SAT 2, SAT 3 and ASIA 1. Two examples of such peptides are shown below using O1k virus positional numbering, and a hyphen to indicate an omitted amino acid residue. It has also been established that the amino acid residue sequence of capsid region 141 to 160 is uniquely and highly unexpectedly antigenically active and potent, as discussed in greater detail hereinafter. Peptides having a sequence of approximately twenty amino acids, within the 130 to 160 region, and in the 141 to 160 region in particular, to which an amino or carboxy terminal Cys or other amino acid may be added to permit attachment by covalent linking by an additional synthesis step to a carrier, e.g.keyhole limpet hemocyanin KLH , if a carrier is to be used, are one embodiment of invention, as are the above peptides with variations in peptide length or substitutions or deletions as to individual amino acids which do not destroy or substantially alter the unique and potent antigenicity exhibited by the FMDV mono specific and polyspecific synthetic antigenic determinant peptides of this invention. These sequences, separated from other antigenically active or antigenically masking sequences, constitute an embodiment of this invention in yet another form. Antigens comprising more than one of the foregoing antigenically active sequences, separate from antigenically interfering or masking sequences, chemically associated or mixed with each other constitute still another form of the invention. Antigens comprising a carrier to which one or more of the foregoing antigenically active amino acid sequences is attached constitutes a further embodiment of this invention. The present invention, of course, also embodies a vaccine containing an antigenic peptide of this invention alone or linked to a carrier along with a physiologically tolerable diluent. The presence of physiologically tolerable diluting adjuvants is optional. In considering the present invention it is important to recognize the following definition of the antigenically active amino acid residue sequences which are considered as one embodiment of the invention. For example, the sequence corresponding to positions 141 to 160 of type O, subytype 1, strain Kaufburen taken from left to right in the direction from amino to carboxy terminus when separated from other peptides, gene fragments, amino acids and amino acid sequences which tend to mask or to interfere with or to cross react or complicate the antigenic effectiveness of the subject peptide is a specific embodiment of the subject invention. Thus, while one may find the specified sequence as part of a large protein or a larger peptide containing, e.g., about 30 amino acids or more, such larger materials do not constitute the present invention because a protein or a larger peptide would not possess the activity, the unusually and unexpectedly high level of substantially mono specific antigenic activity, possessed by an about 20 amino acid long peptide of this invention. The term, The synthetic, antigenic peptides of this invention alone in straight chain or cyclic ring form, as a polymer wherein adjacent peptide repeating units are bonded together by oxidized cysteine residues, or as a conjugate linked to a carrier when introduced in an effective amount as a vaccine into an animal host are typically capable of inducing production of antibodies in the host that immunoreact with the FMDV and protect the host from infection caused by that virus. However, a peptide of this invention can be further defined by a unitary test of its antigenic characteristics that is independent of the form in which the peptide is ultimately used i.e. in straight chain, cyclic ring, polymeric or linked as a conjugate. According to this unitary test, a peptide of this invention in straight chain form when linked to a keyhole limpet hemocyanin carrier as a conjugate and introduced in an effective amount as a vaccine into a host animal is capable of inducing production of antibodies that immunoreact with its related FMDV and protect that host from that virus. The amounts of peptide and carrier, and the specific reaction conditions for the conjugation reaction and vaccine preparation are given in Bittle et al., As a vaccine, the present invention comprises an effective amount of a peptide antigen which may, alone, serve as the vaccine when present with a physiologically acceptable diluent such as water or saline. The vaccine may include a carrier, which may be of any of numerous carriers such as keyhole limpet hemocyanin KLH , tetanus toxoid, poly L Lys Glu , peanut agglutinin, ovalbumin, soybean agglutinin, bovine serum albumin BSA and the like, to which a FMDV mono specific synthetic antigenic determinant peptide is linked. A polymer prepared by linking a plurality of peptides of this invention as through end to end linking of oxidized terminal cysteine groups may also comprise an exogenous carrier free vaccine along with a physiologically acceptable diluent. In each instance, the peptide of this invention functions as the specific antigenic determinant. The effective amount of antigenic peptide depends upon a number of factors. Included among those factors are the body weight and species of animal host to be protected, the carrier when used, the adjuvant when used, the number of inoculations desired to be used, and the duration of protection desired for the animal. Individual inoculations typically contain about 20 micrograms of synthetic antigenic peptide to about 2 milligrams, exclusive of any carrier to which the peptide may be linked. When the antigenic vaccine of this invention is introduced into the desired host, it initiates the production of antibodies in the host to the aforesaid antigenic peptide and to FMDV. Vaccines containing effective amounts of the peptides of this invention not only initiate production of antibodies in the host, but those antibodies are produced in a sufficient amount to protect the animal host from infection with FMDV. Protection of the host can be assessed by the level of neutralizing antibody raised and or the neutralizing index, discussed further hereinbelow. The invention also contemplates antigens in which all or part of the entire carrier is antigenic. Thus, a separate carrier portion may or may not be used. The synthetic antigen formed by linking the FMDV mono specific synthetic antigenic determinant peptide to an antigen carrier as well as the methods of preparing such synthetic antigens are specific aspects of the present invention. In general, the synthetic antigen may be formed by the steps of preparing the FMDV mono specific synthetic antigenic determinant peptide, which immunologically corresponds or corresponds substantially to antigenic determinants of FMDV, and coupling the synthetic determinant to a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier in a separate synthetic step. As a method of manufacturing vaccines, the method comprises synthesizing FMDV mono specific synthetic antigenic determinant peptide which antigenically is the duplicate or substantial duplicate of specified determinant portion of the FMDV VP₁ protein. The synthetic peptide may be, but need not always be, linked to a carrier, to result in an antigen in which the antigenicity is that of the FMDV mono specific antigenic determinant peptide and which, when introduced into a host along with a physiologically tolerable diluent, initiates production of antibodies to the FMD virus. As a method of manufacturing antibodies, the vaccine as described above is injected into a host and antibodies raised in the host to the protein antigen are harvested from host fluids for use in conventional diagnostic procedures to detect the presence of the protein antibody or as therapeutic agents for passive immunoprophylaxis. It will be understood that while there are many procedural steps utilizing many materials in the manufacture of the vaccines and antibody preparations of this invention, as discussed in detail hereinafter, the invention is not limited to the utilization of any particular steps or reagents or conditions, but rather the invention is conceptually as stated above and as defined with particularity in the claims append hereto. Peptides discussed hereinafter were synthesized using known procedures. See, e.g., Marglin, A. and Merrifield, R.B., A low molecular weight, presumably cyclic peptide was prepared by synthesising a peptide having the amino acid sequence of the O1k VP₁ at positions 141 160 Figure 1 and adding cysteine Cys residues at both the amino and carboxy termini diCys peptide . Thereafter, 10 milligrams of the diCys peptide containing Cys residues in un oxidized form were dissolved in 250 milliliters of 0.1 molar ammonium bicarbonate buffer in a beaker. The dissolved diCys peptide was then air oxidized by stirring the resulting solution gently over a period of about 18 hours. At the end of that time period, an Ellman reaction indicated the presence of no free mercaptan. Ellman, The obtained solution was freeze dried. The dried material so produced and hereinafter referred to as the cyclic peptide, or cyclic ring peptide has the amino acid sequence noted before for positions 141 160 of the O1k VP₁ capsid believed to be bonded together amino terminus to carboxy terminus by oxidized cysteine residues i.e., by one cystine residue containing a disulfide bond. Two or more diCys peptides may also be linked together to form the cyclic ring peptide. Two polymeric peptides were also prepared from the above peptide containing un oxidized Cys residues at both peptide termini diCys peptide and bonded to those termini by peptide amide linkages. These polymeric peptides are referred to hereinafter as polymeric peptides A and B. Polymeric peptide A was prepared from the diCys peptide by dissolving that peptide at a concentration of 5 milligrams per milliliter in the above ammonium bicarbonate buffer. Air oxidation as above produced a material that had no free mercaptan by the Ellman reaction. The reaction solution contained no particulate matter after oxidation and was freeze dried to obtain polymeric peptide A in dry form. Polymeric peptide B was prepared in the same buffer with the same oxidizing conditions as polymeric peptide A and the cyclic peptide. Here, however, the concentration of diCys peptide used during oxidation was 23.4 milligrams per 1.2 milliliters of buffer. No free mercaptan was noted by the Ellman reaction after the oxidation reaction, but a small amount of precipitate present in the reaction mixture was observed. The reaction mixture was freeze dried to recover polymeric peptide B, including the precipitate. Each of the above prepared dried solids cyclic peptide and polymeric peptides A and B was used without further purification. Vaccines were prepared from those dried solids by suspending them in complete Freund s adjuvant at concentrations sufficient to provide 100 micrograms of peptide per inoculation. The vaccines used herein contain the stated amount of peptide alone, in straight chain or cyclic form, as a polymer of individual peptides linked through oxidized cysteine residues cystine or linked to a carrier. The stated amounts of peptides refer to the weight of peptide without the weight of a carrier, when a carrier was used. The vaccines also contained a physiologically tolerable diluent such as water or saline, and further typically included an adjuvant. Complete Freund s adjuvant CFA and incomplete Freund s adjuvant IFA are materials well known in the art and are available commercially from several sources. Saponin, a plant produced glycoside, is also a well known adjuvant available commercially from Berghausen Chemical Company, Cincinnati, Ohio as a 5 percent solids solution, and was used herein along with aluminum hydroxide. Vaccine stock solutions were prepared with IFA or CFA as follows An amount of the synthetic peptide, polymeric peptide or conjugate sufficient to provide the desired amount of peptide per inoculation was dissolved in phosphate buffered saline PBS . Equal volumes of CFA or IFA were then mixed with the peptide solution to provide a vaccine containing peptide, water and adjuvant in which the water to oil ratio was 1 1. The mixture was thereafter homogenized to provide the vaccine stock solution. Vaccine stock solutions were prepared with saponin aluminum hydroxide as follows Aluminum hydroxide in an amount of 10 milligrams per milliliter was suspended in an aqueous 0.85 percent solution of sodium chloride. An amount of the synthetic peptide, polymeric peptide or conjugate sufficient to provide the desired peptide amount per inoculation after a dilution to 20 percent was admixed with the aluminum hydroxide suspension and allowed to sorb onto the aluminum hydroxide particles for 2 3 hours. One part of the suspension so prepared was then diluted with 4 parts of a previously diluted saponin solution to form the stock solution of vaccine in which the saponin was present at 0.125 weight percent. Preliminary, screening assays were by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ELISA as discussed by Bittle et al., Responses to various peptide regions of the VP₁ of FMDV type O, subtype 1, strain Kaufbeuren are given in Table 1. These data summarize antibody responses in rabbits, using conventional protocols and illustrate neutralization of a FMD virus containing an amino acid sequence homologous to that of the peptide used for immunization. For details of exemplary protocols, see Lerner et al. U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 248,059 filed March 27, 1981, and Bittle et al., supra. It is emphasized that the neutralization indices for the peptides having the amino acid residue sequence of the 141 160 region in Table 1 were each greater than 3.9 and 3.7, respectively, while the indices shown for the 200 213 region peptides were found to be 3.5 and 3.5, respectively. Synthetic peptides having amino acid residue sequences corresponding substantially to the designated 141 160 and 200 213 amino acid residue positions both neutralized the viruses. However, the neutralization indices of the peptides of this invention whose sequences corresponded substantially to the sequence of amino acid residue positions 141 160 were actually greater than the indices shown. The magnitude of the real difference in neutralization index is shown in Table 4, hereinafter, for another comparison of the same peptides inoculated into rabbits wherein more sensitive neutralization end point determinations were made. It was established that a single innoculation of the antigens was effective in producing neutralizing antibodies in animals and in protecting them against challenge. Table 2 summarizes these results, on guinea pigs, carried out using standard protocol see Lerner et al patent application and Bittle et al., The above data show that the particularly preferred peptide having the amino acid sequence of amino acid residue positions 141 to 160 of the O1k VP₁ capsid includes amino acid residues on either side of the peptide of positions 146 154 predicted by Strohmaier et al., supra, to possess antigenic activity for that capsid protein. In addition, the peptide having the O1k sequence at positions 141 160 contains amino acid residue sequences 141 145 and 155 160 predicted by Stromaier et al., supra, to be inactive, non inducing peptides. The results in Tables 1 and 2, above, illustrate that Stromaier et al. were incorrect in their prediction as to where in the amino acid residue sequence neutralizing antibodies would and would not be raised. The results in Table 3 below, wherein the particularly preferred peptide of this invention having the amino acid residue sequence of positions 141 160 of O1k VP₁ is compared to the peptide of Stromeier et al. having the sequence of positions 146 155 of O1k VP₁, show that the peptide of this invention is about 1000 to about 100,000 times more active in producing neutralizing antibodies than is the predicted peptide of Stromaier et al. An averaged value of those results also indicates that the Stromaier et al. peptide does not induce production of sufficient amounts of antibodies to provide protection to the animal host neutralization indices of 1.1 and 1.5 while the peptide of this invention provides large amounts of protective antibodies neutralization indices equal to or greater than 4.3 and 2.7 . The data in the above Table also illustrate that the 32 amino acid peptide having the sequence of positions 130 161 of O1k VP₁ is inactive in producing neutralizing antibodies. The data relating to the KLH peptide antigen denominated C141 160 show that neutralizing antibody production is not a function of which terminus of the peptide is linked to the carrier. The antigenic peptides of this invention are mono specific, as previously defined. However, these peptides also have varying amounts of cross reactivities with viral serotypes whose amino acid sequences are heterologous to the specific amino acid sequence of a given peptide. Thus, the peptides are also poly specific, to varying degrees. The data of Table 4, below, illustrate the cross reactivity of antibodies raised to antigenic peptide conjugates having the sequence of amino acid positions 141 160 and 200 213, respectively, of O1k VP₁ used to immunize two rabbits for each sequence. Neutralization indices were determined against the homologous virus O1k and the heterologous types A and C viruses. Those data show that serotype specificity of sera produced by inoculation of the synthetic antigenic peptide mimics that found with sera against the whole virus. The cross neutralization is thought to reflect the sequence homology among different serotypes, as is shown in Figure 1. Table 4 also shows the great difference in neutralizing index against O1k between the synthetic peptides whose amino acid residue sequences corresponded substantially to positions 141 160 and 200 213, respectively, of O1k. Thus, in the data shown above, the peptide, also predicted as immunologically active by Strohmaier et al., supra, whose amino acid residue sequence corresponds substantially to positions 200 213 of O1k provided neutralization index values similar to those shown in Table 1 for the same peptide under similar conditions. However, the neutralization indices observed for the peptide of this invention whose amino acid residue sequence corresponded substantially to positions 141 160 of O1k were about one to about three units higher, corresponding to an improvement in neutralization of about 10 to about 1000 fold. Stock solutions of vaccines containing the three cystine linked peptides cyclic peptide, and polymeric peptides A and B were prepared in incomplete Freund s adjuvant as discussed above. These vaccines provided concentrations of peptide of 100 micrograms of peptide per inoculation. Preliminary results of one inoculation in guinea pigs indicated a range of neutralization indices log₁₀ of about 2.3 to 3.0 for all three vaccines. The average neutralization index was about 2.5, indicating that each of the cystine disulfide linked peptides protected the host against the O1k FMDV challenge. A typical neutralization index value for the monomeric, unconjugated peptide whose sequence corresponds substantially to amino acid residue positions of about 141 to about 160 of O1k FMDV is approximately 0.5. These results therefore indicate that a carrier may not be needed to obtain protection in animals against foot and mouth disease. The above results were obtained using inoculations of a KLH peptide conjugate plus a physiologically acceptable diluent such as water along with adjuvants such as complete Freund s adjuvant CFA , incomplete Freund s adjuvant IFA and or aluminum hydroxide. KLH is an acceptable carrier for use in animals, but it is quite costly to use on a commercial scale. The use of alternative carriers including soybean agglutinin, bovine serum albumin BSA , olvalbumin, peanut agglutinin, tetanus toxoid and poly L lysine was also examined. The above results were also obtained by linking the antigenic peptide to the KLH molecule via an additional cysteine Cys residue added at the amino or carboxy terminus of the peptide. The Cys residue was then reacted with the reaction product of KLH and N maleimidobenzoyl N hydroxysuccinimide ester MBS , as discussed in Bittle et al., supra. Both MBS and glutaraldehyde were used as linking agents in the results discussed below. Linking of the synthetic peptide to KLH and BSA with glutaraldehyde was carried out following the general method of Avrameas, The results shown in Table 5 were obtained by linking a peptide of this invention having the amino acid sequence of positions 141 160 of the O1k FMDV VP1 capsid peptide 65 to the carrier shown using MBS. Vaccines were prepared in incomplete Freund s adjuvant. Single inoculations containing sufficient conjugate to provide 100 micrograms of peptide were given subcutaneously to each of six guinea pigs. Peptide antibody titers shown are an average of the six values obtained four weeks after inoculation using the ELISA method of Bittle et al., supra. The above results illustrate that several carriers are almost as active as KLH, while bovine serum albumin provided a superior antibody titer. Preliminary studies also showed that use of peptide 65 and tetanus toxoid with glutaraldehyde as linking agent provided a very good antibody response with one inoculation. For those linking reactions, a solution containing 24.5 milligrams of peptide 65 and 26 milligrams of tetanus toxoid in 12.5 milliliters of phosphate buffered saline PBS, pH 7.2 was prepared. That solution was stirred gently while 1.6 milliliters of a solution containing 0.38 percent glutaraldehyde in PBS was admixed with it. The admixture was stirred for about 18 hours at room temperature, dialyzed against water in 12,000 molecular weight cut off dialysis tubing, and then freeze dried to provide 45 milligrams of dried conjugate. Adjuvant systems were also examined using the above peptide 65 linked carriers. The results illustrated in Table 6 show the effects of varying the carrier between KLH and BSA, the couping agent between MBS and glutaraldehyde, and the adjuvant between incomplete Freund s adjuvant IFA and saponin aluminum hydroxide, referred to in Table 6 as saponin. Each of six guinea pigs was inoculated subcutaneously with vaccines containing 100 micrograms of peptide 65 and the adjuvant in two inoculations, four weeks apart. The results are averaged values for the six animals and are reported as were the results of Table 5. The above data illustrate that saponin aluminum hydroxide provides a higher and more prolonged antibody response than incomplete Freund s adjuvant IFA regardless of whether the peptide was coupled with either glutaraldehyde or MBS, or whether the carrier was KLH or BSA. The data in Table 7, below, show antibody titer responses and neutralization results, using the before described techniques, when peptide 65 coupled to KLH was used as the vaccine along with one of two adjuvant systems. The first horizontal row of data for each vaccine contains the neutralization index log ₁₀ values, while the horizontal row of data therebelow contains the peptide antibody titers obtained by ELISA. The above results illustrate that vaccines containing the three adjuvant system provided greater amounts of antibodies for a longer duration than did the vaccines containing saponin aluminum hydroxide. There also appeared to be little difference between the two dosages administered in saponin aluminum hydroxide. The data in Tables 8 and 9 illustrate responses in mixed breed cattle and swine to multiple inoculations of vaccine containing the peptide 65 KLH conjugate MBS coupled and saponin aluminum hydroxide. Those results illustrate that both animal types respond to the synthetic antigenic peptides by developing antibodies at a level that is considered protective. In each Table, the first horizontal row of data for each animal are neutralization index log ₁₀ results, while the second horizontal row of data are peptide antibody titer values obtained by ELISA. The above results in Table 8 with cattle illustrate an anamnestic response in that the six month booster inoculation triggered memory B cell production of neutralizing antibodies. In a general sense, then, one aspect of the invention is a process for producing FMDV vaccines which have all of the immunizing effect of prior art vaccines but which are totally free of competing or cross referencing immunological side effects. The results reported above as to inoculations with synthetic antigenic peptides of this invention were carried out using peptides of only one sequence for each set of data. The data in Table 3 show that some cross reactivity and poly specifity was observed. In another embodiment of this invention cross reactivity and poly specificity are obtained by inoculations utilizing a plurality of peptides of this invention that are each mono specific to at least a different strain of virus within a genus, or to different serotypes or strains within the genus. Thus, inoculation with a vaccine containing peptides of this invention whose amino acid residue sequences correspond substantially to amino residue positions about 141 to about 160 of both type 01k and type A, subtype 10, strain 61 A10, 61 provides protection against both types 01K and A10, 61. Similarly, a polymeric peptide such as polymeric peptides A and B, discussed hereinbefore, may be prepared as a copolymeric peptide whose repeating peptide units are present in about equal amounts and have amino acid residue sequences corresponding substantially to amino acid residue positions about 141 to about 160 of O1k and A10, 61, respectively. In examining the active antibody inducing regions of the antigenic FMDV capsid it is noted that one determinant region of FMDV VP₁ to which neutralizing antibodies may be raised corresponds substantially to amino acid residue positions of 130 through 160 from the amino terminus of the capsid. The VP₁ capsid includes a total of about 213 amino acid residues from amino terminus to carboxy terminus, using the O1k virus VP₁ as the reference protein. Thus, the region of the protein at which the neutralizing antibody determinant begins is located about 60 percent 130 213 x 100 61 of the way down the amino acid residue sequence of that protein from the amino terminus. That neutralizing antibody producing determinant region ends at about amino acid residue position 160 which represents about 75 of the amino acid residue sequence from the amino terminus. For the more preferred peptides corresponding substantially to amino acid residue positions of 141 through 160 of the FMDV VP₁ capsids, the neutralizing antibody producing determinant region is within the region located at a distance from the amino terminus equal to 66 to 75 percent of the total amino acid residue sequence. Examination of the amino acid residue sequences in Figure 1 and of the readily available appropriate pK The synthetic antigenic peptides of this invention typically bear a net neutral or positive charge, exclusive of any ionic charges caused by terminal amino and or carboxyl groups. Preferably, these peptides bear a net positive ionic charge. Such peptides are also preferably water soluble. It appears, however, that the net neutral to positive charge on the synthetic antigenic peptide is not as important to the peptide s antigenicity as is the fact that the peptide s amino acid residue sequence at least corresponds substantially to a region on the antigenic neutralizing antibody inducing capsid that is between 60 and 75 percent of the length of that sequence from the amino terminus. The method of the invention may be used in the preparation of diagnostic tests, such as immunoassays, in which it is necessary to have antibodies to the organism to be detected or a synthetic antigen mimicking a determinant on the organism to be detected. Such diagnostic techniques include, for example, enzyme immune assay, radioimmune assay, fluorescence immune assay, and other techniques in which either the antibody or the antigen is labelled with some detectable tag. For example, using the double antibody technique outlined by Voller, et al., Enzyme Immune Assays in Diagnostic Medicine , A double antibody ELISA was used in obtaining the above discussed anti peptide antibody titer data, and those data reported in Table 1 of Bittle, et al. supra. Specifics for that ELISA are provided beneath Table 1 of that Bittle et al. report, supra. A diagnostic system of this invention for assaying for the presence of a FMDV antigen contains the antibodies raised to a peptide of this invention present in biologically active form along with a means for indicating the presence of an iommunoreaction. When admixed with a body component such as serum, urine or a tissue extract, the antibodies immunoreact with the FMDV antigen to form an immunoreactant, and the indicating means signals that immunoreaction. For example, the body component may be coated on an ELISA test well and incubated with the antibodies of this invention such as those raised in rabbits, following well known techniques. After rinsing away any un immunoreacted antibodies, a second, enzyme linked second antibody raised to the first type of antibody such as goat antirabbit antibodies containing linked alkaline phosphatase is admixed and incubated in the ELISA well. Any excess of the second antibodies is rinsed out leaving any phosphatase linked goat anti rabbit antibodies that bound to an antibody of this invention within the ELISA well. Subsequent admixture of an enzyme substrate such as A radioactive element such as ¹²⁵I may be bonded to an antibody of this invention to provide the incubating means. Here, for example, the body component may be precoated in a sample tube followed by incubation with the radioactive antibodies and rinsing of excess antibodies from the tube. Radioactivity remaining in the tube after rinsing provides the signal that an immunoreactant was formed. Another embodiment of this invention contemplates a diagnostic system for assaying for the presence of a FMDV antigen in a body component such as those discussed before. This system is particularly useful in competition assays and includes a first reagent and a second reagent in separate containers. The first reagent contains a synthetic, antigenic peptide of this invention in biologically active form. The second reagent contains antibodies in biologically active form that immunoreact with that peptide such as those raised to the peptide. A means for indicating the presence of an immunoreaction between the peptide and antibodies such as discussed hereinbefore is also included either in a separate container as in phosphatase linked goat antirabbit antibodies and its substrate, or along with the antibodies as where radioactive elements are bonded to the antibodies. Admixture of predetermined amounts of the first and second reagents in the presence of a predetermined amount of body component to be assayed provides an amount of immunoreaction signalled by the indicating means. The amount of the immunoreaction is different from a known amount of immunoreaction when a FMDV antigen is present in the body component. In usual practice, the body component is pre incubated with the antibody and that composition is then incubated with the peptide that is bound to the walls of an ELISA well. Rinsing of the well to remove any antibody FMDV antigen complex leaves an immunoreactant of the peptide and antibody whose presence and amount may be signalled by the indicating means. The use of whole, intact, biologically active antibodies is not necessary in many diagnostic systems such as the competition assay discussed immediately above. Rather, only the biologically active idiotype containing, antigen binding and recognition portion of the antibody molecule may be needed. Illustrative of the idiotype containing antibody portions are those known as Fab and F ab ₂ antibody portions that are prepared by well known enzymatic reactions on typically whole antibodies. Whole, intact antibodies, Fab, F ab ₂ portions and the like that contain the antibodies idiotypic regions are denominated herein as idiotype containing polyamides. The phrase idiotype containing polyamide is used in the appended claims to embrace the group of such molecules as are useful in diagnostic products or techniques. However, while Fab or F ab ₂ antibody portions may be utilized as the idiotype containing polyamide of a diagnostic technique or product, use of the whole, intact antibody is usually preferred, if only because preparation of an Fab or F ab ₂ portion of an antibody requires additional reaction and purification of sera. Methods and materials unique to this invention are described with reference to the particular procedure under consideration. In general, however, the laboratory techniques, methods and materials utilized are those commonly used in molecular biology and biochemistry generally. Particular reference is made to The following references disclose particular steps and techniques known in the art and the current state of the art as well. Lerner et al, have been working on FMDV for a long period of time and, for a period, considered that they had identified the optimum specific antigenic determinant peptide fragment for FMDV, only to find that the supposed antigenically active portion did not induce the production of antibodies to FMDV, or induced antibody production at such low levels as to be of little or no practical value. We were aware that Strohmaier, et al., supra, had drawn some inferences as to antigenically active portions of their VP A number of peptides were synthesized, attached to carrier, e.g. KLH, and the resulting antigens were injected into animals. Antibodies from the animals were then challenged with FMDV to determine if the antigen was antigenically efficacious in inducing antibodies to the infectious organism. It was a totally unexpected discovery that such a comparatively small peptide fragment in the region of capsid positions about 130 to about 160, e.g. about a 20 residue long peptide, such as the sequence corresponding to positions about 141 to about 160, was extremely antigenic. It is, of course, impossible to determine whether or not there may be other and possibly even more antigenic nucleotide sequences in the FMDV gene, although there is no reason to predict that such would exist. An about 20 amino acid residue sequence from the VP₁ capsid 130 160 amino acid residue sequence according to this discovery, quite unpredictably and quite suprisingly, seems to be the optimum and probably the ultimate, give or take one or two perhaps three amino acid residues, FMDV mono specific synthetic antigenic determinant peptide. It is not presently known how much one can deviate from the exact peptide without losing the highly unexpected activity and efficacy of the vaccine or antigen of which the determinant is the FMDV mono specific synthetic antigenic determinant however, it is known from experience that 1 the peptide can be lengthened by a few amino acid units, 2 that at least one or two, perhaps up to four or five substitutions can be made, and 3 that the peptide sequence can be shortened slightly, probably by two or three, perhaps four, without losing the uniqueness of the invention. Such nonsubstantial deviations are known, in principle, to be possible without departing from the concept which has been described and the discovery which has been made. Thus, such minor variations are to be regarded as mere equivalent variants of the invention. Our results show clearly that a single innoculation of the synthetic peptide constituted by about twenty amino acid residues in the 130 160 region, e.g. region 141 160, elicits sufficient virus neutralizing antibody to protect against a challenge with the virus. The protection afforded by the peptide is several orders of magnitude greater than the best results obtained by immunization with the capsid protein VP₁, irrespective of whether this is produced by disruption of virus particles or by expression in One clear advantage of the synthetic peptide of the present invention is its activity in eliciting a protective antibody response by a The diagnostic and therapeutic applications of the antigens of this invention, and the vaccine and antibody preparations thereof are of great industrial and economic value. Animals, such as swine and cattle, and including man, can be protected against the ravages of foot and mouth disease thus increasing the supply of food and, importantly, of protein for the human population. The foregoing is intended as illustrative of the present invention but not limiting. Numerous variations and modifications may be effected without department from the true spirit and scope of the novel concepts of the invention. It is to be understood that no limitation with respect to the specific peptides, antibodies, their compositions and uses illustrated herein is intended or should be inferred. The invention is defined by the claims which follow.
