## Description
POLYETHERIMIDE POLYETHERSULFONEIMIDE COPOLYMERSBackground Polyetherimides are amorphous, high performance engineering thermoplastics characterized by high heat resistance, high strength and modulus, good electrical properties which remain stable over a wide range of temperatures and frequencies. Unmodified polyetherimide resin is transparent and exhibits inherent flame resis trance and low smoke evolution without additives. Polyetherimides are generally provided by effecting reaction between certain aromatic bis etheranhydride and organic diamine. The resulting polymer exhibits high rigidity, creep resistance and high heat deflection temperatures due to the rigid aromatic imide functionality while the ether moiety confers the necessary degree of chain flexibility for good melt procesibility and flow behavior. U.S. Patent 4,107,147 discloses polysulphoneimide compounds. These compounds are provided by reacting organic diamines with aromatic bis sulfoneanhydrides .Although these compounds have the advantage of the rigid aromatic imide functionality, they suffer from the lack of those properties that are contributed to a polymer having an ether moiety.

In producing the polyetherimide polyethersulphoneimide copolymers of the present invention, a diaminosulphone of Formula IV and an organic diamine of Formula V are utilized. The molar ratio of the diaminosulphone and organic do gamine can vary depending on the desired properties of the copolymers to be produced. The diaminosulphone can constitute from about 5 to 95 mole percent of the total diamine moiety reacted, with the balance being the diamine of Formula V i.e., 95 to 5 mole percent.Preferably, the diaminosulphone is from about 10 to 90 mole percent of the total do gamine moiety, and particularly preferred copolymers are those in which the diaminosulphone moiety is from about 20 to 80 mole percent of the total diamine moiety. By controlling the proportions of the polymeric units of Formulas I and II, each having predetermined properties, a copolymer can be produced having superior properties over a polymer containing oily One of the polymeric units. In general, the higher proportion of the polymeric units of Formula I will result in a polyethersulphoneimide having a higher glass transition temperature. On the other hand, a polyetherimide polyether suiphoneimide copolymer having a higher proportion of the polymeric units of Formula II will have lower glass transit ion temperatures. Copolymers having greater than 1, e.g. 10 to 10,000 or more polymeric units of Formula I and Formula II can be formed. These polymers can be blended with various fillers such as finely divided silica, glass fibers, carbon whiskers, perlite, etc. The resulting filled compositions can, on a weight basis, have a proportion of from about 1 part to 200 parts of filler per hundred parts of copolymer. The blending of the filler with the copolymer can be achieved by adding the filler prior to forming the melt or directly to the melt. Stirring can be effected with standard agitating means to facilitate blending the ingredients. The novel copolymers of the present invention have application in a wide variety of physical shapes and form, including their use as films, molding compounds, coatings, etc. Thus, the compositions of the present invention can be used in automobile and aviation applications for decorative and protective purposes, as high temperature electrical insulation, for motor slot lines, in transformers, as dielectric capacitors, as coil and cable wrappings, for containers and container linings, in laminating structures where films of the present composition or where solutions of the claimed compositions of matter are applied to various heat resistant or other type of materials such as asbestos, mica, glass fiber and the like and superposing the sheets one upon the other and thereafter subjecting them to elevated temperatures and pressures to effect flow and cure of the resinous binaer to yield cohesive laminated structures. Alternatively, solutions of the compositions herein described can be coated on electrical conductors such as copper, aluminum, etc,, and thereafter the coated conductor can be heated at elevated temperatures to remove the solvent and to effect curing of the compositions thereon. If desired, an additional overcoat may be applied to such insulated conductors including the use of polymeric coatings, such as polyamides, polyesters, silicones, polyvinylformal resins, epoxy resins, other polyimides, polytetrafluoroethylene, etc. The copolymers herein disclosed and claimed may be suitably incorporated with other materials to modify the properties of the latter or in turn they may be modified by the incorporation of the materials. For example, they may be compounded with substances such as natural or synthetic rubbers, synthetic resins such as polycarbon ate, polyamides, polysulphones, polyethersulphones, polyetheretherketones, polyamideimides, polyphenylene oxide and polyesters such as polyethylene terephthalate and polybutlyene terephthalate. The blend may also contain mixtures of the above synthetic resins.Because of the advantageous high temperature properties of these polymeric compositions, the incorporation of these polymers in other polymers which may not be so favorably disposed, for instance, polycarbonate resins, polyphenylene oxide resins, polybutylene terephalate resins, etc.in amounts ranging from 5 to 75 , by weight, based on the total weight of the polyethersulfoneimide and the aforesaid resins, can improve the properties of the resins in which the polyethersulfoneimides of the present invention are incorporated.
