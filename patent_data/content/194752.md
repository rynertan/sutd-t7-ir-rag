## Description
NZTROGEN CONTAZNING COMPOUNDS This invention relates to new nitrogen containing compounds and more particularly it relates to new dihydropyridine derivatives which possess antihypertensive properties. Many 2,6 dialkyl 4 aryl 1 ,4 dihydropyridine 3,5 dicarboxylate derivatives are known which inhibit the movement of calcium ions in the cardiovascular system of warm blooded animals, and which thereby produce an anti hypertensive effect. The most used of these is nifedipine, which is dimethyl 1,4 dihydro 2,6 dimethyl 4 o nitrophenylpyridine 3,5 dicarboxylate. Also known are many l aryloxy 3 amino propan2 ol derivatives which possess beta adrenergic receptor blocking properties and which also produce an anti hypertensive effect. Two of the most used of these are propranolol and atenolol, which are respectively l naphth l yloxy and l ç carbamoylmethylphenoxy 3 isopropyl ami nopropan 2 ol. The only described attempt to combine these two types of chemical structure into one molecule is reported by Merck workers in the Journal of MedicinalChemistry, 1981, Vol. 24, pages 628 to 631, in which a 3 amino 2 hydroxypropoxy substituent was introduced into the 4 aryl substituent of a 4 aryl l,4 dihydropyridine derivative, without much success in producing a compound with antihypertensive activity of the type sought by the authors. We have now found that compounds which do possess useful antihypertensive activity may be obtained by suitably combining a 3 aryloxy 2 hydroxypropylamino moiety with a 1,4 dihydropyridine moiety. According to the present invention there is provided a dihydropyridine of the formula EMI2.1 wherein R1 and R2, which may be the same or different, each is alkyl or alkoxyalkyl each of up to 6 carbon atoms wherein R3 is alkyl of up to 6 carbon atoms wherein benzene ring A bears one or more substituents selected from halogeno, cyano, nitro, trifluoromethyl and alkyl of up to 6 carbon atoms or bears the substituent N O N attached to the 2 and 3 positions that is, to form a benzo 2,1 ,3 oxadiazole nucleus wherein Ar is phenyl, naphthyl, tetrahydronaphthyl, indanyl or indenyl which is unsubstituted or which bears one or more substituents selected from halogeno, trifluoromethyl, hydroxy, amino, nitro, carbamoyl and cyano, and alkyl, alkenyl, alkoxy, alkenyloxy, alkoxyalkoxy, alkyl thio, alkanoyl, carbamoylalkyl and alkanoylamino each of up to 6 carbon atoms or Ar is a 5 or 6 membered heterocyclic ring containing 1, 2 or 3 heteroatoms selected from oxygen, nitrogen and sulphur, which ring is saturated or unsaturated, which ring is unsubstituted or bears one or more substituents selected from oxo, halogeno, trifluoromethyl, phenyl and morpholino, and alkyl and alkoxy each of up to 6 carbon atoms, and arylalkyl of up to 12 carbon atoms, and which ring may also be fused to a benzene ring, Ar being joined to the rest of the molecule either from the heterocyclic ring or from the fused benzene ring wherein p is 0 or 1 wherein q is 1, 2, 3 or 4 wherein X is 0 , NH , r NHCO or CONH and wherein Y is straight or branched chain alkylene of 2 to 12 carbon atoms which may optionally be interrupted by one or two groups selected from oxygen 0 , sulphur S , imino and substituted imino NR4 wherein R4 is hydrogen, alkyl or alkanoyl each of up to 10 carbon atoms, phenyl or aralkyl of up to 12 carbon atoms , phenylene, substituted phenylene, pyridylene, cycloalkylene of up to 6 carbon atoms, 1 ,4 piperazinediyl, 1 ,4 piperidinediyl and amido CONH or NHCO groups or an acid addition salt thereof. t will be observed that the dihydropyridine derivative of the invention possesses at least two asymmetric carbon atoms, namely the carbon atom of the CHOH group in the alkanolamine chain, and the carbon atom at the 4 position of the dihydropyridine nucleus, and it can therefore exist in racemic and optically active forms.

The dihydropyridine derivatives of the invention may be manufactured by any chemical process known to be useful for the manufacture of chemicallyanalogous compounds. One preferred process for the manufacture of a dihydropyridine derivative of the invention comprises the reaction of an amine of the formula EMI7.1 wherein A, R1, R2, R3, q, X and Y have the meanings stated above, with an epoxide of the formula EMI7.2 wherein Ar and p have the meanings stated above, or, when p is 0, with a haloketone of the formula HalCH2CO Ar wherein Ar has the meaning stated above and wherein Hal stands for a halogeno group, for example bromo, followed by reduction, for example with sodium borohydride, of the aminoketone thus obtained.

A second preferred process for the manufacture of a dihydropyridine derivative of the invention wherein the group Y is alkylene interrupted as stated above comprises joining the two parts of the molecule at the point of interruption of Y. Thus, for example, when Y is alkylene interrupted by an amido group CONH , the process comprises the reaction of an acid of the formula EMI8.1 wherein A, R1, R2, R3, q and X have the meanings stated above, or an activated derivative thereof, with an amine of the formula H2NY2 NHCH2CHOH CH20 pAr wherein Ar and p have the meanings stated above, and wherei n yl and y2 are such that Y1 CONH Y2 has the same meaning as stated above for Y. A third process for the manufacture of a dihydropyridine derivative of the invention comprises the reaction of a compound of the formula EMI9.1 wherein A, R1 R2, R3, q, X and Y have the meanings stated above and wherein Z stands for a displaceable group, with an amine of the formula H2NCH2CHOH CH2O p Ar wherein Ar and p have the meanings stated above.

This process may be carried out in a diluent or solvent at an elevated temperature, conditions conventionally used for the Hantszch synthesis of di hydropyri di nes. As stated above the dihydropyridine derivatives of the invention possess antihypertensive activity. This may be demonstrated by the ability of the compound to reduce the blood pressure of a spontaneously hypertensive rat, or of a rat made hypertensive by treatment with deoxycorticosterone acetate, or of a dog made hypertensive by the Goldblatt technique of unilateral nephrectomy and clipping of the contralateral kidney. These are all standard tests used to demonstrate anti hypertensive effects of medicaments. Some of the dihydropyridine derivatives of the invention possess beta adrenergic blocking properties, some of them possess calcium ion slow channel blocking properties and some of them possess both such activities. A preferred dihydropyridine derivative of the invention possesses both such activities. Betaadrenergic blocking activity may be demonstrated in vivo by the ability of the compound to inhibit isoprenaline induced tachycardia in a rat or cat, or in vitro by shifting to the right the dose response curve of a guinea pig atrium to isoprenaline. Calcium ion slow channel blocking activity may be demonstrated in vitro by the ability of the compound to reduce spontaneous contraction in a rat portal vein preparation. These also are all standard tests used to demonstrate the stated activities. Because of the beta adrenergic blocking and or calcium slow channel blocking properties a dihydropyridine of the invention may also be useful in the treatment of heart diseases such as angina pectoris and cardiac arrhythmias. At doses of a dihydropyridine. derivative which produce effective antihypertensive activity in a rat or dog no symptom of toxicity is apparent.
