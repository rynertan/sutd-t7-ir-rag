# Hairdressing scissors.

## Abstract
Scissors, particularly, intended for use in hairdressing, wherein one blade 1 of the scissors has a straight, even, blunt edge 2 and the other blade 3 has its edge divided along its length into a plurality of sections, alternate sections having first 4 and second 5 types of edge. For example, the blade may have alternating cutting and non cutting sections, cutting and thinning sections or thinning and non cutting sections. This allows certain hairdressing styles and effects, which previously required laborious use of conventional scissors and comb, to be achieved simply and quickly.

## Claims
CLAIMS 1. Scissors comprising first and second blades, said first blade having a straight, even inner edge and said second blade having its inner edge divided along its length into a plurality of sections, alternate sections having first and second types of edge, said types of edge being so configured that, in the closed position of the scissors, at least one of said types of edge for at least part of the length of each section leaves an open, non cutting area through the blades. 2. Scissors as claimed in claim 1, wherein said first type of edge comprises a cutting edge, and said second type of edge is a straight, even, blunt edge, recessed from the adjoining sections so as to provide said non cutting area. 3. Scissors as claimed in claim 1, wherein said first type of edge comprises a cutting edge, and said second type of edge comprises a straight, even cutting edge divided along its length into alternating narrow cutting sections and non cutting recesses. 4. Scissors as claimed in claim 2 or claim 3, in which the cutting edge of the first type of edge is shaped along its length to form a shallow V. 5. Scissors as claimed in claim 2 or claim 3, in which the cutting edge of the first type of edge is shaped along its length to form a shallow concave curve. 6. Scissors as claimed in claim 1, wherein said first type of edge comprises a straight, even cutting edge divided along its length into alternating narrow cutting sections and non cutting recesses. 7. Scissors according to any preceding claim, in which the inner edge of the first blade is blunt. 8. Scissors according to any preceding claim, in which the inner edge of the first blade is sharpened to a cutting edge.

## Description
Hairdressing Scissors This invention relates to scissors and is intended particularly for use in hairdressing. Previously, in order to achieve certain effects and styles in hairdressing, for example weave cutting , laborious and time consuming use of conventional scissors and comb was necessary. Thinning scissors are known in which one blade has a plain cutting edge and the other blade is provided with evenly spaced fine teeth. The purpose of such scissors is to reduce the bulk of an area of hair without reducing the overall length as seen by the observer. The effect to be achieved by thinning scissors is quite different to that addressed by the present invention. DE OS 2 721 672 shows a toothed scissor having a particular arrangement of overlying blades and grooves which are designed for the purpose of allowing underlying hair to be cut when applied to a strand held out from the head. An object of the present invention is to provide a series of scissors which enable weave cutting and other special effects to be achieved rapidly and by less skilled personnel. Accordingly, the present invention provides scissors comprising first and second blades, said first blade having a straight, even inner edge and said second blade having its inner edge divided along its length into a plurality of sections, alternate sections having first and second types of edge, said types of edge being so configured that, in the closed position of the scissors, at least one of said types 9f edge for at least part of the length of teach section leaves an open, non cutting area through the blades. Three main types of scissors are envisaged in the present invention i The second blade has cutting sections and sections which are completely non cutting ii The second blade has cutting sections and sections similar to thinning scissors iii The second blade has sections similar to thinning scissors and sections which are completely non cutting. Several embodiments of the invention will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a perspective view of a first embodiment of the invention Fig. 2 is a side elevation of the second blade of said first embodiment Fig. 2A is a view similar to Fig. 2 but showing a modification Fig. 3 is an enlarged side elevation of a portion of the second blade of a second embodiment Fig. 3A is a view similar to Fig. 3 but showing a modification Fig. 4 is an enlarged side elevation of a portion of the second blade of a third embodiment and Figs. 5A and 5B are cross sections through the blades illustrating alternative forms for the straight blade. Referring now to Figure 1, a pair of scissors comprises two blades, a first blade 1 having a straight, even, blunt edge 2 and a second blade 3. The edge of the second blade 3 is divided along its edge into a plurality of sections and alternate sections are shaped to provide first and second types of edge 4,5. In the embodiment of Fig. 1, the first type of edge 4 comprises a cutting edge which is shaped to form a shallow V. This V shape improves the cutting efficiency of the scissors. The second type of edge 5 comprises a straight, even, blunt edge which is recessed from the adjoining sections of the blade. Thus, when the scissor blades are brought together, the hair caught between the cutting sections 4 of the second blade 3 and the first blade 1 will be cut while the hair caught between the blunt, recessed sections 5 and the first blade 1 will be left uncut. This allows certain hair styles and effects to be achieved quickly and easily which would previously have required careful and time consuming use of conventional scissors and comb. Fig. 2A illustrates a modification of the foregoing, in which the cutting edge is in the form of a shallow curve 4A rather than a V. A straight cutting edge is also possible within the scope of the invention. The embodiment of Figure 3 uses the same first type of edge 4 as in Fig. 2, but in this case the Vshaped cutting edge is alternated with a straight, even cutting edge 6 which is divided along its length into narrow cutting sections 7 and non cutting recesses 8.Thus, in this case, the scissors selectively cut and thin the hair. Fig. 3A shows the embodiment of Fig. 3 modified in the same manner as the modification of Fig. 2A. The third embodiment of Fig. 4 alternates the blunt recessed sections 4 of the first embodiment with the thinning sections 6 of the second embodiment to achieve a third effect by selectively thinning the hair or leaving it uncut. Fig. 5A is a cross section showing the first blade 1 as described above, that is with its inner edge 2 blunt. Alternatively, as shown in Fig. 5B, the inner edge may also be sharpened to a cutting edge 2A. The size of the blade sections depends upon the style which it is desired to achieve, however if they are too large the effect will become too extreme and if they are too small it will not be noticeable.Section lengths in the range 2.5mm to lOmm are appropriate. A section length of approximately 5mm is particularly suitable for achieving pleasing results.
