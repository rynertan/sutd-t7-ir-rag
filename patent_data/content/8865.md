# FM CW radar.

## Abstract
In a frequency modulated carrier wave radar the detec tion of the beat frequency that represents range is inter rupted for short intervals that occur near maxima or minima of the modulating signal 3a that controls the frequency of the transmitted carrier wave. During these intervals of inter ruption the carrier wave is modulated in amplitude so that it can convey information B to the target that it illuminates. In a preferred embodiment, the amplitude modulation consists of a variable number of cycles of a voltage controlled oscil lator 7 of which the frequency is controlled by an integrated signal which represents the beat frequency. Timing for the short intervals of amplitude modulation and somewhat longer intervals that extend before and after each interval of amplitude modulation is derived from a square wave signal 3b that is produced by an oscillator that governs the fre quency of the carrier wave.
