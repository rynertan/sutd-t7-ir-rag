# Radiant energy focusing apparatus.

## Abstract
For concentrating radiant solar energy a reflecting sur face 6 that is orientable is provided, the reflector 6 directing the radiant energy to a collector 22 which has a fixed posi tion. The reflector 6 is fixed at one end 12 and moves about an arc at the other end 19 so that the mechanism is simple and can be inexpensively fabricated.
