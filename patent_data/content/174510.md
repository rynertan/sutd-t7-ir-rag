# Epoxy resin composition for encapsulation of semiconductor device.

## Abstract
There is disclosed an epoxy resin composition for encapsulation of semiconductor device, which comprises the components a , b , c and at least one of the components d and e as shown below a 100 parts by weight of an epoxy resin having at least 2 epoxy groups in one molecule b 8 to 65 parts by weight of a novolak type phenolic resin with an ortho ratio less than 50 c 1.2 to 40 parts by weight of a polyvinyl acetal compound d 0.8 to 30 parts by weight of a silicone oil and e 4 to 80 parts by weight of a rubber modified phenolic resin. The epoxy resin composition for encapsulation of semi conductor device of the present invention can retain its high glass transition temperature in the cured product thereof and also has low modulus of elasticity as well as excellent humidity resistance and thermal shock resistance.
