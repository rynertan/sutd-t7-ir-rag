# Tool compensation apparatus, and a method of correcting for tool wear.

## Abstract
In a numerical controlled machine tool a controlled object e.g. tool TL1 is positioned in dependence upon a command value as modified by a tool compensation value. A command value is held in a register CR and a com pensation value is held in a register CPR. The command and compensation values are algebraically added by an arithmetic circuit ART2 and the result is used to position the tool TL1. The number of times the tool is used is counted in a counter UT and when that number equals a preset count value n1 held in register CTR coincident unit CIN detects equality , a correction amount Î”T1 is added to the content of register CPR by arithmetic unit ART3, to provide a new compensation value in register CPR taking into account tool wear.

## Description
TOOL COMPENSATION APPARATUS AND A METHOD OF CORRECTING FOR TOOL WEAR. This invention relates to tool compensation apparatus and a method of correcting for tool wear. the correcyion of Previously, a tool compensation value, relating to a particular tool,Sor tool wear in a numerical control machine tool, has been determined by an operator measuring the size of an actually cut workpiece or by means of a measuring instrument mounted on the machine tool. Compensation data relating to such tool compensation values thus determined has been entered by an operator into a numerical controller of the machine tool, or such compensation data as obtained by the measuring instrument has been entered into the numerical controller via a special interface. Accordingly, the first method has required an operator to carry out an appropriate measurement at a proper time and hence has been troublesome, whereas the second method has involved the use of a measuring instrument and an interface, thereby increasing cost. Thus, these previous methods have suffered from disadvantages and there is today a demand for a means of providing automatic tool compensation without substantial cost increase. According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided tool wear compensation apparatus, having a command value register for storing a command value, and a compensation value register for storing a compensation value, adapted so that an object the position of which is controlled takes up a position corresponding to the command value as modified by the compensation value, characterised by means for maintaining a value indicative of the amount of use of a tool, and means for correcting the compensation value stored in the compensation value register by a preset amount when the value indicative of the amount of use of the tool reaches a predetermined limit, thereby to take into account wear of the tool. According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of compensating for tool wear, comprising storing a command value, and storing a compensation value, positioning an object the position of which is controlled in dependence upon the command value as modified by the compensation value, and characterised by w maintaining a value indicative of the amount of use of a tool, and correcting the compensation value by a preset amount when the value indicative of the amount of use of the tool reaches a predetermined limit, thereby to take into account wear of the tool. An embodiment of the present invention provides a tool compensation system which permits automatic correction of tool compensation data without the necessity of an automatic measuring instrument and an interface. Briefly stated, embodiments of this invention, provide that tool compensation data is automatically corrected by a preset value whenever the number of times a tool has been used, or alternatively whenever the duration of time for which a tool has been used, exceeds a predetermined value. Reference is made, by way of example, to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a schematic diagram for assistance in explanation of turning operations to which a workpiece is subjected and Figs. 2, 3 and 4 are respective block diagrams showing principal parts of respective apparatuses embodying the present invention. In ordinary working, several tools are employed in accordance with particular parts of a workpiece to be machined. For example, in the cutting of such a workpiece as is shown in Fig. 1, there are required, in addition to rough and finish machining tools, various tools for machining respective parts of the workpiece, such as a screw cutting tool for a part A, a cutting off tool for a part B, etc. The amounts of wear of the respective tools usually differ from one another. These amounts of wear can be discovered from the nature of the tools themselves and the quality of material of the workpiece.Accordingly, it is possible to preset data, for example, for increasing the amount of compensation effective for the tool used for machining the part A by tT1 after nl machining operations, for increasing the amount of tool compensation for the tool used for machining the part B by N T2 after n2 machining operations, etc. In the presentinvention, such data is prestored in a memory of numerical control equipment or entered as input instructions to automatically modify the compensation data in response to.the wear of each tool. Fig. 2 illustrates in a block form an example of apparatus, in a numerical controlled machine tool, embodying the present invention. In Fig. 2, PT is a command tape having recorded thereon data for determining the amounts of movement of tools, command data such as tool select instruction and so forth TR is a tape reader DEC is a decoder CR is a command value register KB is a keyboard CPR is a compensation value register ART1 to ART3 are arithmetic circuits APR is a current value register INT is an interpolator SA is a servo circuit SM is a servo motor PC is a pulse coder ACT is an actuator for use in tool changing TL1 and TL2 are tools W is a workpiece INR is a compensation data storing register UT is a counter for counting the frequency of use of a tool CTR is a register for setting the number of times of the use of a tool and CIN is a coincidence circuit. In Fig. 2, in response to a tool select command for example, T1 from the command tape PT the tool changing actuator ACT operates to select the tool TL1, and compensation data corresponding to the tool TL1 is preset in the register CPR from the keyboard RB. A movement command value from the command tape PT is set in the register CR via the tape reader TR and the decoderDEC and, for compensation, the compensation data is algebraically added by the arithmetic circuit ART1 to the command value. The resulting compensation command value is algebraically added by the arithmetic circuit ART2 to the content of the register APR, and the difference between the compensation command value and the content of APR is provided to the interpolator INT to effect positioning of the tool TL1.For repetitive working standardized previously, the wear tS T1 of the tool TL1 after use nl times is obtained in advance. These data values nl and T1 are entered from the keyboard KB and stored in the registers CTR and INR respectively. Upon each occurrence of a select command T1 for the tool TL1 from the command tape PT, the command is counted by the counter UT. Accordingly, when the tool TL1 has been selected and used nl times, this is detected by. the coincidence circuit CIN, and the content A T1 of the register INR. is added via the arithmetic circuit ART3 to the content of the register CPR, thereby correcting the compensating data The counter UT is reset by a coincidence signal and thereafter counts tool select commands again, whereby operation as described above is repeated and the compensation data is corrected by correction data ss T1 each time the tool TL1 has been used a further nl times.As the input to the counter UT, use can also be made of a signal available from a limit switch LS which is activated by the arrival of the movable machine part at a predetermined reference point for example, the point of termination of one machining operation . Fig. 3 is a block diagram showing another example of apparatus embodying the present invention. In Fig. 3,CPR1 to CPRN are compensation value registers INR1 to INRN are compensation data registers UT1 to UTN are counters for counting the frequency of use of respective tools CTR1 to CTRN are registers for setting the frequency of use of respective tools AN1 to ANN are AND circuits G1 to G3 are gates and ART4 and ARTS are arithmetic circuits. In Fig. 3, RST is an initial reset signal nl to nn are respective set values for the frequencies of use the number of times of use of respective tools C1 toCN are respective compensation values for the respective tools and Z2T1 to ATN denote respective correction values for the respective tools. Such data is entered in advance from the keyboard and set in registers corresponding to the respective tools. In Fig. 3, respective pluralities of registers and counters are provided for each respective one of a plurality of tools. As inputs to the counters UT1 toUTN, use is made of the respective logical products of respective tool select commands T1 to TN and an auxiliary code MOl similarly prerecorded on the command tape. The gate G1 reads out the contents of corresponding ones of the registers CTR1 to CTRN and the countersUT1 to UTN into the arithmetic circuit ART4 in a repeating cyclic order with a predetermined period. When coincidence of the contents is detected by the arithmetic circuit ART4, the corresponding one of the countersUT1 to UTN is reset and, at the same time, the content of that one of the registers INR1 corresponding to the tool in respect of which coincidence was detected by the arithmetic circuit ARTS, is added to the corresponding one of the registers CPR1 to CPRN. Fig. 4 shows in block form another example of the present invention, in which respective counters CNT1 to CNTN receive, as input signals, the logical products of respective tool select commands TI to TN, respective cutting commands CUTI to CUTN and a reference pulseCLK via AND circuits Al to AN. Accordingly, in the example of Fig. 4, the contents of the respective counters.CNT1 to CNTN represent the respective durations of use of the respective corresponding too and these counter contents and values preset in the registers TR1 to TRN are compared. Namely, th.e value set in the registers TR1 to TRN and the contents of the counters CNT1 to CNTN are compared by an arithmetic circuit ART6 via a gate G4.Upon detection of coincidence, a compensation value register content correction command COMS is obtained and the content of the corresponding counter is reset via a gate G5. The present invention can provide for inexpensive.tool compensation equipment which permits automatic correction of a tool compensation value without the necessity of a measuring instrument and a special interface circuit. In the machining of a workpiece by a numericalcontrolled machine tool, there are needed command values which determine the configuration of a finished product and compensation values which depend on the tool to be used. Tool compensation data values must be corrected in response to wear of the tool. In an embodiment of the present invention, taking notice of the fact that correction data corresponding to wear of the tool can be predetermined from the frequency number of times used or time duration of use of the tool and the amount of its wear which can be unequivocally determined by the quality of materials of the tool and of a workpiece, counter means are provided for counting the frequency or time of use of the tool and means is provided for correcting by a predetermined value the content of a compensation value register, holding tool compensation data, when the count content of the counter means has reached a predetermined value.
