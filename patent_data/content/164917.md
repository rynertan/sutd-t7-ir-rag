# Central tire inflation system.

## Abstract
A central tire inflation system 10 comprising a pressure relief valve 180 fluidly interposed control means 142, 156, 164, 154, 172 and a tire valve assembly 56, 58 is provided. The control valve assembly is effective to selectively pressu rize or exhaust a first conduit 170 connected to a first port 178 of the pressure relief valve, a second conduit 50, 52 extends from a third port 184 of the pressure relief valve to the tire valve assembly and a second port 182 is connected to atmosphere. The pressure relief valve is effective to establish fluid communication between said first and second ports thereof when the pressure in said first conduit exceeds the pressure in said second conduit and to establish fluid communication between the second conduit and the exhaust port 182 if the pressure in said second conduit exceeds the pressure in said first conduit. The tire valve assembly is fluidly connected to a third conduit 68 fluidly connected to the interior pressurized chamber 74 of an inflatable tire 12 . The tire valve assembly is effective in response to pressuriza tion of the second conduit above a first reference pressure and pressurization of said interior chamber above a mini mum tire pressure reference value to establish fluid flow between said second and third conduits.
