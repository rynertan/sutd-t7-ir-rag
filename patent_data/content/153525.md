## Abstract
A vacuum sysem trap characterised in that it comprises A cracking means and B cold walls adjacent thereto is disclosed. A process for the removal of deleterious gas es from a vacuum chamber or line characterised in that it comprises cracking the gas es to a form having a higher sticking coefficient and condensing such gas es on a cold surface using such a trap is also disclosed.
