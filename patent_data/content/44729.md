# Cobalt III complex containing image forming compositions.

## Abstract
A thermally activatable image forming composition contains a cobalt III complex having releasable ligands, an amplifier compound which reacts with cobalt II or released ligands to form an agent for the conversion of the complex to cobalt II and released ligands, a material which generates an image by dye formation or dye destruction in response to imagewise conversion of the complex, and a destabilizer which facilitates conversion of the complex, and hence the image forming reaction, by heating, is characterized by containing as the destabilizer two destabilizer compounds which are present at concentrations such that the tempera ture required for initiating the image forming reaction is lower than the initiation temperature obtainable using either destabilizer compound alone. Images can be produced in coatings of the composition by imagewise thermal exposure or by incorporating a photoinhibitor in the composition and exposing the coating imagewise prior to heating overall.
