## Description
Desc Clms Page number 1 POSTAGE METER APPARATUS HAVING MICROPROCESSOR CONTROLLED D. C. MOTOR AND PROCESS FOR USE THEREWITH The present invention is generally concerned with postage meters and mailing machines, and processes for operating such apparatus. In U. S. Patent No. 2,934,009 issued April 26,1960 to Bach, et al. and assigned to the assignee of the present invention there is described a postage meter which includes a drive mechanism connected by means of a drive train to a postage meter drum. The drive mechanism includes a single revolution clutch for rotating the drum from a home position and into engagement with a letter fed to the drum. The drum prints a postage value on the letter while feeding the same downstream beneath the drum as the drum returns to the home position. Each revolution of the single revolution clutch and thus the drum, is initiated by the letter engaging a trip lever to release the helical spring of the single revolution clutch. The velocity versus time profile of the peripherary of a drum driven by the clutch approximates a trapezoidal configuration, having acceleration, constant velocity and deceleration portions, fixed by the particular clutch and drive train used in the application. This being the case, the throughput rate of any mailing machine associated with the meter is dictated by the cycling speed of the postage meter rather than by the speed with which the individual mailpieces are fed to the postage meter. Further, although Desc Clms Page number 2 the single revolution clutch structure has served as the workhorse of the industry for many years it has long been recognized that it is a complex mechanism which is relatively expensive to construct and maintain, does not precisely follow the ideal trapezoidal velocity vs. time motion profile which is preferred for drum motion, tends to be unreliable in high volume applications, and is noisy and thus irritating to customers. Accordingly, an object of the invention is to replace the postage meter drum drive mechanism of the prior art with the combination of a D. C. motor and a computer, and program the computer for causing the D. C. motor to drive the drum in accordance with an ideal trapezoidal shaped velocity versus time profile which is a function of the input velocity of a mailpiece andAnother object is to replace the trip lever as the drive initiating device and utilize in its place a pair of spaced apart sensing devices in the path of travel of a mailpiece fed to the postage meter, and program the computer to calculate the input velocity of a mailpiece, based upon the time taken for the mailpiece to traverse the distance between the sensing devices, and adjust the time delay and acceleration of the drum before arrival of the mailpiece at a position at which drum rotation is commenced to cause the drum to timely engage the leading edge of the mailpiece. Desc Clms Page number 3 According to one aspect of the invention, in combination with a postage meter including a rotary drum having a periphery adapted for feeding a sheet in a path of travel, there is provided an improvement comprising first means for sensing a time interval during which a sheet is linearly displaced a predetermined distance in the path of travel a d. c. motor coupled to the drum for rotation thereof second means for sensing angular displacement of the drum and computer means coupled to the first and second sensing means and to the d. c. motor, the computer means comprising means responsive to the first sensing means for providing respective amounts representative of desired angular displacements of the drum during successive sampling time periods, means responsive to the second sensing means for providing respective amounts representative of actual angular displacements of the drum during successive sampling time periods, and means for compensating for the difference between desired and actual angular displacements and generating a d.c. motor control signal for controlling rotation of the motor to cause the linear displacement of the periphery of the drum to substantially match the linear displacement of the sheet during respective sampling time periods.

Motor Figure 21 including Figs. 21a, 21b and 21c shows the time intervals during which the motor control signal and its separable components are calculated to permit early application of the signal to the motor Figure 22 including Figs. 22a and 22b is a block diagram of the computer according to the invention andFigure 23 including Figs. 23a l, 23a 2,23b and..23c shows the flow charts portraying the processing steps of the computer. As shown in Fig. 1, the apparatus in which the invention may be incorporated generally includes an electronic postage meter 10 which is suitably removably mounted on a conventional mailing machine 12, so as to form therewith a slot 14 Fig. 2 through which sheets, including mailpieces 16, such as envelopes, cards or other sheet like materials, may be fed in a downstream path of travel 18. The postage meter 10 Fig. 1 includes a keyboard 30 and display 32. The keyboard 30 includes a plurality of numeric keys, labeled 0 9 inclusive, a clear key, labeled c and a decimal point key, labeled . , for selecting postage Desc Clms Page number 6 values to be entered a set postage key, labeled s , for entering selected postage values and an arithmetic function key, labeled , for adding subsequently selected charges such as special delivery costs to a previously selected postage value before entry of the total value. In addition, there is provided a plurality of display keys, designated 34, each of which are provided with labels well known in the art for identifying information stored in the meter 10, and shown .on the display 32 in response to depression of the particular key 34, such as the postage used , postage unused , control sum , piece count , batch value and batch count values. A more detailed description of the keys of the keyboard 30 and the display 32, and their respective functions may be found in U.S. Patent No. 4,283,721 issued August 11, 1981 to Eckert, et al. and assigned to the assignee of the present invention. In addition, the meter 10 Fig. 1 includes a casing 36, on which the keyboard 30 and display 32 are conventionally mounted, and which is adapted by well known means for carrying a cyclically operable, rotary, postage printing drum 38. The drum 38 Fig. 2 is conventionally constructed and arranged for feeding the respective mailpieces 16 in the path of travel 18, which extends beneath the drum 38, and for printing entered postage on the upwardly disposed surface of each mailpiece 16. For postage value selecting purposes, the meter 10 Fig. 1 also includes a conventional postage value selection mechanism 40, for example, of the type shown in U.S. Patent No. 4,287,825 Desc Clms Page number 7 issued September 8,1981 to Eckert, et al. and assigned to the assignee of the present invention. The mechanism 40 which is operably electrically coupled via the postage meter s computer 41 to the keyboard 30 and display 32, includes a first stepper motor 42 for selecting any one of a plurality of racks 43, associated on a one for one basis with each of the print wheels 44, and a second stepper motor 45 for actuating each selected rack 43 for positioning the appropriate printing element of the associated print wheel 44. The rack selection stepper motor 42, which is referred to by skilled artisans as a bank selector motor, is appropriately energized via power lines 46 from the computer 41 for selecting the appropriate rack and the rack actuating stepper motor 45, which is referred to by skilled artisans as a digit selector motor, is appropriately energized via power lines 47 from the computer 41 to move the selected rack for selecting the appropriate digit element of the associated print wheel 44. A more detailed description of the value selection mechanism 40 may be found in the aforesaid U.S. Patent No. 4,287,825. The computer 41 for the postage meter 10 generally comprises a conventional, microcomputer system having a plurality of microcomputer modules including a control or keyboard and display module, 41a, an accounting module 41b and a printing module 41c. The control module 41a is both operably electrically connected to the accounting module 41b and adapted to be operably electrically connected to an external device via respective two way serial communications Desc Clms Page number 8 channels, and the accounting module 41b is operably electrically connected to the printing module 41c via a corresponding two way serial communication channel. In general, each of the modules 41a, 41b and 41c includes a dedicated microprocessor 41d, 41e or 41f, respectively, having a separately controlled clock , and programs. And twoway communications are conducted via the respective serial communication channels utilizing the echoplex communication discipline, wherein communications are in the form of serially transmitted single byte header only messages, consisting of ten bits including a start bit followed by an 8 bit byte which is in turn followed by a stop bit, or in the form of a multi byte message consisting of a header and one or more additional bytes of information, Further, all transmitted messages are followed by a no error pulse if the message was received error free. In operation, each of the modules 41a, 41b and 41c is capable of processing data independently and asynchronously of the pther. In addition, to allow for compatibility between the postage meter 10 and any external apparatus, all operational data transmitted to, from and between each of the three modules 41a, 41b and 41c, and all stored operator information, is accessible to the external device via the two way communication channel, as a result of which the external apparatus if any may be adapted to have complete control of the postage meter 10 as well as access to all current operational information in the postage meter 10. In addition, the flow of messages to, from and between the three internal modules 41a, 41b and 41c is in Desc Clms Page number 9 a predetermined, hierarchical direction. For example, any command message from the control module 41a is communicated to the accounting module 41b, where it is processed either for local action in the accounting module 41b and or as a command message for the printing module 41c. On the other hand, any message from the printing .module 41c is communicated to the accounting module 41b where it is either used as internal information or merged with additional data and communicated to the control module 41c. And, any message from the accounting module 41b is initially directed to the printing module 41c or to the control module 41a. A more detailed description of the various prior art modules 41a, 41b and 41c, and various modifications thereof, may be found in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,280,180 4,280,179 4,283,721 and 4,301,507 each of which patents is assigned to the assignee of the present invention. The mailing machine 12 Fig. 2 , which has a casing 19, includes a A.C. power supply 20 which is adapted by means of a power line 22 to be connected to a local source of supply of A.C. power via a normally open main power switch 24 which may be closed by the operator. Upon such closure, the mailing machine s D. C. power supply 26 is energized via the power line 28. In addition, the mailing machine 12 includes a conventional belt type conveyor 49, driven by an A. C. motor 50, which is connected for energization from the A.C. power supply 20 via a conventional, normally open solid state, A.C. motor, relay 52, which is timely energized by a computer 500 for closing the relay 52. Upon such closure the A.C. Desc Clms Page number 10 motor 50 drives the conveyor 49 for feeding mailpieces 16 to the drum 38. To facilitate operator control of the switch 24, the mailing machine preferably includes a keyboard 53 having a start key 53a and a stop key 53b, which are conventionally coupled to the main power switch 24 to permit the operator to selectively close and open the switch 24. Assuming the computer 500 has timely energized the relay 52, the A.C. motor 50 is energized from the A.C. power supply 20. Whereupon the conveyor 49 transports the individual mailpieces 16 , at a velocity corresponding to the angular velocity of the motor 50, in the path of travel 18 to the postage printing platen 54. According to the invention, the machine 12 includes first and second sensing devices respectively designated 56 and 58, which are spaced apart from each other a predetermined distance dl, i. e., the distance between points A and B in the path of travel 18. Preferably, each of the sensing devices 56 and 58, is an electro optical device which is suitably electrically coupled to the computer 500 sensing device 56 being connected via communication line 60 and sensing device 58 being connected via communication line 62. The sensing devices 56,58 respectively respond to the arrival of a mailpiece 16 at points A and B by providing a signal to the computer 500 on communication line 60 from sensing device 56 and on communication line 62 from sensing device 58. Thus, the rate of movement or velocity V1 of any mailpiece 16 may be calculated by counting the elapsed time tv Fig. 3 between arrivals of the mailpiece 16 at points A Desc Clms Page number 11 and B, and dividing the distance dl, bythe elapsed time tv. To that end, the computer 500 is programmed for continuously polling the communications lines 60 and 62 each time instant Tn at the end of a predetermined sampling time period, T, preferably T l millisecond, and to commence counting the number of time instants Tn when the leading edge of a given mailpiece 16 is detected at point A, as evidenced by a transition signal on communication line 60, and to end counting the time instants Tn when the given mailpiece 16 is detected at point B, as evidenced by a transition signal on communication line 62. Since the distance dl, is a mechanical constant of the mailing machine 12, the velocity of the mailpiece may be expressed in terms of the total number Nt of time instants Tn which elapse as the given mailpiece traverses the distance dl. For example, assuming a maximum velocity of 61 inches per second, dl 2.75 inches and T l millisecond the total number Nt of elapsed time instants Tn may be found by dividing dl 2.75 inches by Vl 61 inches per second to obtain Nt 45, i. e., the total number of time instants Tn which elapse between arrivals of the mailpiece at points A and B. Thus, the number Nt 45 corresponds to and is representative of a mailpiece velocity of Vl 61 inches per second. Assuming normal operation of the transport system and calculation of the value of VI having been made, the time delay td Fig. 3 before arrival of the mailpiece 16 at point C may be calculated by dividing the distance d2 between points B and C by the mailpiece s velocity V1, provided the Desc Clms Page number 12 distance d2 is known. Since the integral of the initial, triangularly shaped, porti.on of the velocity versus time profile is equal to one half of the value of the product of Ta and V1, and is equal to the arc d3 described by point E on the drum 38, as the drum 38 is rotated counter clockwise to point D, the distance between points C and D is equal to twice the arcuate distance d3. Accordingly, d2 may be conventionally calculated, as may be the time delay td for the maximum throughput velocity. Assuming rotation of the drum 38 is commenced at the end of the time delay td and the drum 38 is linearly accelerated to the velocity V1 to match that of the mailpiece 16 in the time interval Ta during which point E on the drum 38 arcuately traverses the distance d3 to point D, Ta may be conventionally calculated. In addition, assuming commencement of rotation at the end of the time delay td and that the drum 38 is linearly accelerated to the velocity V1 during the time interval Ta, the mailpiece 16 will arrive at point D coincident with the rotation of point E of the outer periphery 73 the drum 38 to point D, with the result that the leading edge 73a of the drum s outer periphery 73, which edge 73a extends transverse to the path of travel 18 of the mailpiece 16, will engage substantially the leading edge of the mailpiece 16 for feeding purposes and the indicia printing portion 73b of the periphery 73 will be marginally spaced from the leading edge of the mailpiece 16 by a distance d4 which is equal to the circumferential distance between points E and F on the drum 38. Since the circumferential distance d5 on the drum 38 between points E and G is fixed, the time interval Tc during which the drum 38 is rotated at the constant velocity V1 may also be calculated. When point G on the drum 38 is rotated out of engagement with the mailpiece 16, the drum 38 commences deceleration and continues to decelerate to rest Desc Clms Page number 13 during the time interval Td. The distance d6 which is traversed by point G, as the drum 38 is rotated to return point E to its original position of being spaced a distance d3 from point D, is fixed, and, Td may be chosen to provide a suitable deceleration rate for the drum, preferably less than Ta. In addition, a reasonable settling time interval Ts is preferably added to obtain the overall cycling time TcT of , the drum 38 to allow for damping any overshoot of the drum 38 before commencing the next drum cycle. For a typical maximum drum cycle time period TcT of 234 milliseconds and a maximum mailpiece transport rate of 61 inches per second, typical values for the acceleration, constant velocity, deceleration and settling time intervals are Ta 37 milliseconds, Tc 124 milliseconds, Td 24 milliseconds and Ts 234 185 49 milliseconds. Utilizing these values, the required acceleration and decceleration values for the drum 38 during the time intervals Ta and Td may be conventionally calculated. In addition, since the integral of the velocity versus time profile is equal to the distance traversed by the circumference of the drum 38 during a single revolution of the drum 38, the desired position of the drum 38 at the end of any sampling time period of T l millisecond may be calculated. For target velocities VI which are less than the maximum throughput velocity, it is preferably assumed that integral of, and thus the area under, the.velocity versus time profile remains constant, and equal to the area thereof at the maximum throughput velocity, to facilitate conventional calculation of the values of the time delay td, Desc Clms Page number 14 the time intervals Ta, Tc and Td, and the acceleration and decceleration values for each of such lesser velocities VI. For computer implementation purposes, the computer 500 is programmed as hereinbefore discussed to continously poll the communication lines 60 and 62, from the sensing devices 56 and 58, respectively, each time interval Tn, and count the time intervals Tn between arrivals of the mailpiece 16 at points A and B as evidenced by a transition signals on lines 60 or 62. Further, the computer 500 is programmed to calculate the current velocity of the mailpiece 16 in terms of the total number Nt of the counted time intervals Tn, store the current velocity and, preferably, take an average of that velocity and at least the next previously calculated velocity if any to establish the target velocity VI. In addition, it is preferable that precalculated values for the time delay td, acceleration and decceleration corresponding to each of a plurality of target velocities be stored in the memory of the computer 500 for fetching as needed after calculation of the particular target velocity. In this connection it is noted that the velocity at any time t of the drum 38 may be expressed by adding to the original velocity Vo each successive increment of the product of the acceleration and time during each time period of T l millisecond, each successive increment of constant velocity and each successive increment of the product of the decceleration and time during each time period T. Preferably, the acceleration and decceleration values are each stored in the form of an amount corresponding to a Desc Clms Page number 15 predetermined number of counts per millisecond square which are a function of the actual acceleration or decceleration value, as the case may be, and of the scale factor hereinafter discussed in connection with measuring the actual angular displacement of the motor drive shaft 122 whereby the computer 500 may timely calculate the desired angular displacement of the motor drive shaft 122 during any sampling time interval T. In this connection it is noted that the summation of all such counts is representative of the desired linear displacement of the circumference of the drum 38, and thus of the desired velocity versus time profile of drum. rotation for timely accelerating the drum 38 to the target velocity VI, maintaining the drum velocity at Vl for feeding the particular mailpiece 16 and timely deccelerating the drum 38 to rest. The postage meter 10 Fig. 1 additionally includes a conventional, rotatably mounted, shaft 74 on which the drum 38 is fixedly mounted, and a conventional drive gear 76, which is fixedly attached to the shaft for rotation of the shaft 74. According to the invention, the mailing machine 12 Fig. 1 includes an idler shaft 80 which is conventionally journaled to the casing 19 for rotation, and, operably coupled to the shaft 80, a conventional home position encoder 82. The encoder 82 includes a conventional circularly shaped disc 84, which is fixedly attached to the shaft 80 for rotation therewith, and an optical sensing device 86, which is operably coupled to the disc 84 for detecting an opening Desc Clms Page number 16 88 formed therein and, upon such detection., signalling the computer 500. The machine 12, also includes an idler gear 90 which is fixedly attached to the shaft 80 for rotation therewith. Further, the machine 12 includes a D.C. motor 120, which is suitably attached to the casing 19 and has a drive shaft 122. The machine 12 also includes a pinion gear 124, which is fixedly attached to the drive shaft 122 for rotation by the shaft 122. The gear 124 is disposed in driving engagement with the idler gear 90. Accordingly, rotation of the motor drive shaft 122 in a given direction, results in the same direction of rotation of the drum drive shaft 76 and thus the drum 38. Preferably, the pinion gear 124 has one fifth the number of teeth as the drum drive gear 76, whereas the idler gear 90 and drum drive gear 76 each have the same number of teeth. With this arrangement, five complete revolutions of the motor drive shaft 122 effectuate one complete revolution of the drum 38, whereas each revolution of the gear 90 results in one revolution of the gear 76. Since there is a one to one relationship between revolutions, and thus incremental angular displacements, of the drum shaft 74 and idler shaft 90, the encoder disc 84 may be mounted on the idler shaft 90 such that the disc s opening 88 is aligned with the sensing device 86 when the drum 38 is disposed in its home position to provide for detection of the home position of the drum shaft 74, and thus a position of the drum shaft 74 from which incremental angular displacements may be counted. Desc Clms Page number 17 For sensing actual incremental angular displacements of the motor drive shaft 122 Fig. 1 from a home position, and thus incremental angular displacements of the drum 38 from its rest or home position as shown in Fig. 2, there is provided a quadrature encoder 126 Fig. 1 . The encoder 126 is preferably coupled to the motor drive shaft 122, rather than to the drum shaft 74, for providing higher mechanical stiffness between the armature of the d. c. motor 120 and the encoder 126 to avoid torsional resonance effects in the system. The encoder 126 includes a circularly shaped disc 128, which is fixedly attached to the motor drive shaft 122 for operably connecting the encoder 126 to the motor 120. The disc 128 Fig. 4 which is otherwise transparent to light, has a plurality of opague lines 130 which are formed on the disc 128 at predetermined, equidistantly angularlyspaced, intervals along at least one of the dics s opposed major surfaces. Preferably the disc 128 includes one hundred and ninety two lines 130 separated by a like number of transparent spaces 132. In addition, the encoder 126 includes an optical sensing device 134, which is conventionally attached to the casing 19 and disposed in operating relationship with respect to the disc 128, for serially detecting the presence of the respective opaque lines 130 as they successively pass two reference positions, for example, positions 136ra and 136rb, and for responding to such detection by providing two output signals, one on each of communications lines 136a and 136b, such as signal A Fig. 5 on line 136a and signal B on line 136b. Since the disc Desc Clms Page number 18 128 Fig. 4 includes 192 lines 130 and the gear ratio of the drum drive gear 76 Fig. 1 to the motor pinion gear 124 is five to one, nine hundred and sixty signals A and B Fig. 5 are provided on each of the communications lines 136a and 136b during five revolutions of the motor drive shaft 122, and thus, during each cycle of rotation of the drum 38. Since the angular distance between successive lines 130 Fig. 4 is a constant, the time interval between successive leading edges Fig. 5 of each signal A and B is inversely proportional to the actual velocity of rotation of the motor drive shaft Fig. 1 and thus of the drum 38. The encoder 126 is conventionally constructed and arranged such that the respective reference positions 136a and 136b Fig. 4 are located with respect to the spacing between line 130 to provide signals A and B Fig. 5 which are 90 electrical degrees out of phase. Accordingly, if signal A lags signal B by 90 Fig. 5 the D. C. motor shaft 122 Fig. 1 , and thus the drum 38, is rotating clockwise, whereas if signal A leads signal B by 90 Fig. 5 the shaft 122 and drum 38 are both rotating counter clockwise. Accordingly, the angular displacement in either direction of rotation of the drum 38 Fig. 1 from its home position may be incrementally counted by counting the number of pulses A or B, Fig. 5 as the case may be, and accounting for the lagging or leading relationship of pulse A Fig. 5 with respect to pulse B. The quadrature encoder communication lines, 136a and 136b Fig. 1 , may be connected either directly to the computer 500 for pulse counting thereby or to the computer Desc Clms Page number 19 500 via a conventional counting circuit 270 Fig. 6 , depending on whether or not the internal counting circuitry of the computer 500 is or is not available for such counting purposes in consideration of other design demands of the system in which the computer 500 is being used. Assuming connection to the computer 500 via a counting circuit 270, the aforesaid communications lines, 136a and 136b are preferably connected via terminals A and B, to the counting circuit 270. In general, the counting circuit 270 Fig. 6 utilizes the pulses A Fig. 5 to generate a clock signal and apply the same to a conventional binary counter 274 Fig. 6 , and to generate an up or down count depending on the lagging or leading relationship of pulse A Fig. 5 relative to pulse B and apply the up or down count to the binary counter 274 Fig. 6 for counting thereby. More particularly, the pulses A and B Fig. 5 which are applied to the counting circuit terminals A and B Fig. 6 are respectively fed to Schmidt trigger inverters 276A and 276B. The output from the inverter 276A is fed directly to one input of an XOR gate 278 and additionally via an R C delay circuit 280 and an inverter 282 to the other input of the XOR gate 278. The output pulses from the XOR gate 278, which acts as a pulse frequency doubler, is fed to a conventional one shot multivibrator 284 which detects the trailing edge of each pulse from the XOR gate 278 and outputs a clock pulse to the clock input CK of the binary counter 274 for each detected trailing edge. The output from the Schmidt trigger inverters 276A and 276B are Desc Clms Page number 20 respectively fed to a second XOR gate 286 which outputs a low logic level signal zero , or up count, to the up down pins U D of the binary counter 274 for each output pulse A Fig. 5 which lags an output pulses B by 90 electrical degrees. On the other hand the XOR gate 286 Fig. 6 outputs a high logic level one or down count, to the up down input pins of the binary counter 274 for each encoder output pulse A Fig. 5 which leads an output pulse B by 90 electrical degrees. Accordingly, the XOR gate 286 Fig. 6 provides an output signal for each increment of angular displacement of the encoded shaft 122 Fig.. 1 and identifies the direction, i. e., clockwise or counter clockwise, of rotation of the encoded shaft 122. The binary counter 274 Fig. 6 counts the up and down count signals from the XOR gate 286 whenever any clock signal is received from the multivibrator 284, and updates the binary output signal 272 to reflect the count. Accordingly, the counting circuit 270 converts the digital signals A and B, which are representative of incremental angular displacements of the drive shaft 122 in either direction of rotation thereof, to an eight bit wide digital logic output signal 272 which corresponds to a summation count at any given time, of such displacements,. multiplied by a factor of two, for use by the computer 500. Since the angular displacement of the shaft 122 from its home position is proportional to the angular displacement of the drum 38 from its home position, the output signal 272 is a count which is proportional to the actual linear displacement of the outermost periphery of the drum 38 at the end of a Desc Clms Page number 21 given time period of rotation of the drum 38 from its home position. For a typical postage meter drum 38, having a circumference, i. e., the arc described by the outermost periphery of the drum 38 in the course of revolution thereof, of 9.42 inches, which is connected to the motor drive shaft 122 via a mechanical transmission system having a 5 1 gear ratio between the motor 120 and drum 38, wherein the encoder disc 128 has 192 lines the counting circuit 270 will provide an output of 2 x 192 384 counts per revolution of the shaft 122, and 5 x 384 1920 counts per revolution of the drum 38 which corresponds to 203.82 counts per inch of linear displacement of the periphery of the drum. Accordingly, the maximum mailpiece transport velocity of Vl 61 10 3 inches per millisecond may be multiplied by a scale factor of 203.82 counts per inch to express the maximum transport velocity in terms of counts per millisecond, or, counts per sampling time period T where T l millisecond i.e., 61 10 3 inches per millisecond times 203.82 counts per inch 12.43 counts per sampling time period T. Similarly, any other target velocity Vl, or any acceleration or decceleration value, may be expressed in terms of counts per sampling time interval T, or counts per square millisecond, as the case may be, by utilization of the aforesaid scale factor. For energizing the D.C. motor 120 Fig. 1 there is provided a power amplifying circuit 300 The power amplifying circuit 300 Fig. 7 is conventionally operably connected to the motor terminals 302 and 304 via power lines 306 and 308 respectively. The power amplifying circuit 300 Desc Clms Page number 22 preferably comprises a conventional, H type, push pull, control signal amplifier 301 having input leads A, B, C and D, a plurality of optical electrical isolator circuits 303 which are connected on a one for one basis between the leads A D and four output terminals of the computer 500 for coupling the control signals from the computer 500 to the input leads A, B, C, and D of the amplifier 301, and a plurality of conventional pull up resistors 305 for coupling the respective leads A D to the 5 volt source. The amplifier 301 includes four conventional darlington type, pre amplifier drive circuits including NPN transistors Tl, T2, T3 and T4, and four, conventional, darlington type power amplifier circuits including PNP transistors Ql, Q2, Q3 and 04 which are respectively coupled on a one for one basis to the collectors of transistors Tl, T2, T3 and T4 for driving thereby. The optical electrical isolator circuits 303 each include a light emitting diode Dl and a photo responsive transistor T5. The cathodes of Dl are each connected to the 5 volt source, the emitters of T5 are each connected to ground and the collectors of T5 are each coupled, on a onefor one basis, to the base of one of the transistors Tl, T2, T3 and T4. With respect to each of the opto isolator circuits 303, when a low logic level signal is applied to the anode of Dl, Dl conducts and illuminates the base of T5 thereby driving T5 into its conductive state whereas when a high logic level signal is applied to the anode of Dl, Dl is non conductive, as a result of which T5 is in its nonconductive state. With respect to each of the combined Desc Clms Page number 23 amplifier circuits, Tl and Ql, T2 and Q2, T3 and Q3, and T4 and Q4, when the lead A, B, C or D, as the case may be, is not connected to ground via the collector emitter circuit of the associated opto isolator circuit s transistor T5, the base of Tl, T2, T3 or T4, as the case may be, draws current from the 5 volt source via the associated pull up resistor 305 to drive the transistor Tl, T2, T3 or T4, as the case may be, into its conductive state. As a result, the base of transistor Ql, Q2, Q3 or Q4, as the case may be, is clamped to ground via the emitter collector circuit of its associated driver transistor Tl, T2, T3 or T4, thereby driving the transistor Ql, Q2, Q3 or Q4, as the case may be, into its conductive state. Contrariwise, the transistor pairs Tl and Ql, T2 and Q2, T3 and Q3, and T4 and Q4 are respectively biased to cut off when lead A, B, C or D, as the case may be, is connected to ground via the collector emitter circuit of the associated opto isolator circuit s transistor T5. As shown in the truth table Fig. 8 for clockwise motor rotation, Ql and Q4 are turned on and Q2 and Q3 are turned off whereas for counter clockwise motor rotation, Q2 and Q3. are turned on and Ql and Q4 are turned off. Accordingly, for clockwise motor rotation terminal 302 Fig. 7 of the motor 120 is connected to the 30 volt source via the emittercollector circuit of Ql, which occurs when Q2 is turned off and the base of Ql is grounded through the emitter collector circuit of Tl due to the base of Tl drawing current from the 5 volt source in the presence of a high logic level control signal at input terminal A and terminal 304 of the motor 120 Desc Clms Page number 24 is connected to ground via the emitter collector circuit of Q4, which occurs when Q3 is turned off and the .base of Q4 is grounded through the emitter collector circuit of T4 due to the base of T4 drawing current from the 5 volt.source in the presence of a high logic level signal at the input terminal D. On the other hand, for counter clockwise rotation of the motor 120 terminal 302 of the motor 120 is connected to ground via the emitter collector circuit of Q2, which occurs when Ql is turned off and the base of Q2 is grounded through the emitter collector circuit of T2 due to the base of T2 drawing current from the 5 volt source in the presence of a high logic level control signal at the input terminal B and terminal 304 of the motor 120 is connected to the 30 volt source via the emitter collector circuit of Q3, which occurs when Q4 is turned off and the base of Q3 is grounded through the emitter collector of T3 due to the base of T3 drawing current from the 5 volt source in the presence of a high logic level control signal at the input terminal C. For turning off the respective powers transistors Q1 Q4, on a two at a time basis, low level control signals are applied on a . selective basis to the two terminals B and C, or A and D, as the case may be, to which high logic control level signals are not being applied which occurs when the opto isolator circuit s transistors T5 associated with the respective leads B and C or A and D are driven to their conductive states, When this occurs the bases of the transistors T2 and T3, or Tl and T4, as the case may be, are biased to open the emittercollectors circuits of the transistors T2 and T3, or Tl and Desc Clms Page number 25 T4, as the case may be, as a result of which the bases of the transistors Q2 and Q3, or Ql and Q4, as the case may be, are biased to open the emitter collector circuits of transistors Q2 and Q3, or Ql and Q4, as the case may be. The velocity of the motor 120 Fig. 7 is controlled by modulating the pulse width and thus the duty cycle of the high logic level, constant frequency, control signals, i.e., pulse width modulated PWM signals, which are timely applied on a selective basis to two of the leads A D, while applying the low level logic signals to those of leads A D which are not selected. For example, assuming PWM signals Fig. 9 having a 50 duty cycle are applied to leads A and D Fig. 7 , and low level logic signals are applied to leads B and C, for clockwise rotation of the motor 120, the velocity of the motor 120 will be greater than it would be if high logic level PWM signals Fig. 9 having a 25 duty cycle were similarly applied and will be less than it would be if high logic level PWM signals having a 75 duty cycle were similarly applied. Accordingly, assuming rotation of the motor 120 Fig. 7 is commenced by utilizing high logic level PWM signals having a given duty cycle percentage, the velocity of the motor 12 0 may be decreased or increased, as the case may be, by respectively decreasing or increasing the duty cycle percentage of the applied high logic level PWM signals. Further, assuming the motor 120 is rotating clockwise due to PWM signals having a selected positive average value being applied to leads A and D, in combination with low level logic signals being applied to leads B and C, Desc Clms Page number 26 the motor 120 may be dynamically braked by temporarily applying high level PWM signals having a selected duty cycle corresponding to a given positive average value to leads B and C, in combination with low logic signals being applied to leads A and D. To avoid damage to the power transistors Ql, Q2, Q3 and Q4 which might otherwise result, for example, due to current spikes accompanying back emf surges which occur in the course of switching the circuit 301 from one mode of operation to the other, the emitter collector circuits of the power transistors Ql, Q2, Q3 and Q4 are respectively shunted to the 30 volt source by appropriately poled diodes, Dl, D2, D3 and D4 connected across the emitter collector circuits of Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4. To control the motion of the drum 38 Fig. 1 during each cycle of drum rotation, the D. C. motor 120 and its shaft encoder 126 are respectively connected to the computer 500 via the power amplifier circuit 300 and the counting circuit 270. And the computer 500 is programmed to calculate the duration of and timely apply PWM control signals to the power amplifier circuit 300 after each sampling time instant Tn, utilizing an algorithm based upon a digital compensator D s derived from analysis of the motor 120, motor load 38, 74, 76, 90 and 124 amplifying circuit 300, encoder 126, counting circuit 270, and the digital compensator D s in the closedloop, sampled data, servo control system shown in Fig. 10. With reference to Fig. 10, in general, at the end of each predetermined sampling time period of T l millisecond, the eight bit wide count representing the angular Desc Clms Page number 27 displacement of the motor drive shaft 122 and thus the drum 38, from its home position is sampled by the computer 500 at the time instant Tn. Under the control of the program of the computer 500 Fig. 10 , a summation is taken of the aforesaid actual count and the previously calculated count representing the desired position of the motor drive shaft 122, and thus the drum 38, at the end of the time period T, and, under control of the computer program .implementation of the algorithm, a PWM control signal which is a function of the summation of the respective counts, or error, is applied to the power amplifier circuit 301 for rotating the motor drive shaft 122 such that the error tends to become zero at the end of the next sampling time period T. To derive the algorithm, the servo controlled system of Fig. 10 is preferably analyzed in consideration of its equivalent Laplace transformation equations shown in Fig. 11, which are expressed in terms of the following Table of Parameters and Table of Assumptions.

Due to a key factor .for providing acceptably fast motor response being the system s resonance between the motor and load, the derivation of the transfer function D S for stabilization of,.the system is preferably considered with a view to maximizing the range of frequencies within which the system will be responsive, i. e., maximizing the system s bandwidth, BW. For calculation purposes a sampling period of T l millisecond was chosen, due to having chosen a Model 8051 microprocessor, available from Intel Corporation, Palo Alto California, for control purposes, and inasmuch as the Model 8051 microprocessor equipt with a 12 MHz crystal for providing a clock rate of 12 MHz, is able to conveniently implement a 1 KHz sampling rate and also implement application software routines, after control algorithm interations, during the sampling period of T l millisecond. However, other sampling periods and other conventional microprocessors may be utilized without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. The open loop system gain H S without compensation, of the servo loop system of Fig. 10 is shown in Fig 12 a . To tolerate inaccuracies in the transmission system between the motor and drum load, such as backlash, it was considered acceptable to maintain a steady state count accuracy of plus or minus one count. To reflect this standard, the gain equation of Fig. 12 a was adjusted to provide a corrective torque Ct with a motor shaft movement, in radians per count, Desc Clms Page number 30 equivalent to the inverse expressed in radians per count, of the gain Kp of the encoder counting circuit transform. Since the corrective torque Ct is primarily the friction of the transmission system which has to be overcome by the motor at start up, the value of Ct may be assumed to be substantially equal to a maximum estimated numerical value based on actual measurements of the starting friction of the system, i. e., 35 ounce inches, as a result of which a numerical value of the starting voltage Vs may be calculated from the expression Vs Ct Ra Kt, i.e., Vs 6.5 volts, which, in turn, permits calculation of a numerical value for the minimum overall system gain Ko, at start up, from the equation Ko Vs Kp, i. e., Ko 397 volts per radian, or for simplication purposes, 400 volts radian. Accordingly, the open loop uncompensated gain H1 S may be rewritten as H2 S as shown in Fig. 12 b , in which a gain factor of Kc has been included, to account for the torque Ct and the value of Ko is substituted for the overall D. C. gain, i.e., Kv Km Kp Ka Kc Ko. Although the numerical value of Kc may also be calculated, it is premature to do so, since it has not as yet been established that Ko, which has been adjusted by the value of Kc to provide a minimum value of Ko, is acceptable for system stability and performance purposes. Otherwise stated, Ko may not be the overall system gain which is needed for system compensation for maximizing the system bandwidth BW, as a result of which it is premature to conclude that Kc will be equivalent to the D. C. gain of the system compensator D S . Desc Clms Page number 31 At this juncture, the bode diagram shown in Fig. 13, may be constructed due to having calculated a minimum value for Ko. As shown in Fig. 13, the absolute value of H2 S , in decibels, has been plotted against the frequency W in radians per second, based on the calculated minimum value of Ko, the selected value of T and calculated values of the poles f1 and f2. From the Bode diagram, a numerical value of the crossover frequency Wc1 of the Bode plot of H2 S may be determined, i.e., Wc1 was found to be substantially 135 radians per second. And, since the value of Wc1 is substantially equal to the bandwidth BWu of the uncompensated open loop system H2 S , a calculation may be made of the phase margin 8m of the uncompensated system from the expression m 180 H S at Wcl, or, otherwise stated m 180 tan 1 pie 2 tan 1 Wc1 f1 tan 1 Wc1 f2 tan 1 WclT 2 . From this calculation, there was obtained a phase margin value which was much, much, less i.e., 5 than 45 , which, for the purposes of the calculations was taken to be a minimum desirable value for the phase margin m in a positiontype servo.system. Accordingly, it was found that the uncompensated system H2 S was unstable if not compensated. Since an increase in phase lead results in an increase in bandwidth BW, and the design criteria calls for maximizing the bandwidth BW and increasing the phase margin to at least 45 phase lead compensation was utilized. By definition, a phase lead compensator D S the Laplace transform shown in Fig. 14, wherein Kc is the phase lead D. C. gain, and fz and fp are respectively a zero pole Desc Clms Page number 32 frequency and a phase lead pole frequency. Adding the transfer function of the phase lead compensator D S the Bode plot of the uncompensated system s transfer function H2 S , results in the Bode plot of the compensated system transfer function H3 S , if the zero pole fz of the phase lead compensator D S chosen to be equivalent to fl in order to cancel the lag due to the mechanical time constant of the uncompensated transfer function H2S. As shown in Fig. 13, the cross over frequency Wc2 for the compensated system H3 S may be read from the Bode diagram, i.e., Wc2 was found to be substantially equal to 400 radians per second. And, since by definition the pole frequency fp lies at the geometric means of fp and Wc2, the value of the fp may be established by doubling the linear distance between Wc2 and W O, as measured along the W axis, and reading the value , of fp from the Bode diagram, i. e., fp was found to be substantially equal to 3,400 radians per second, Since numerical values may thus be assigned to both Wc2 and fp from the Bode diagram, the compensated phase margin mc, i.e., the phase margin for the phase lead compensated system H3 S in which fz has been equated to f1, may be found from the expression mc 180 90 tan 1 Wc2 f2 tan 1 Wc2T 2 . Upon calculating the compensated phase margin mc it was found to be 50 and, therefore, greater than the minimum phase margin criteria of 45 . In addition, the value of Wc2 for the compensated system H3 S was found to be substantially three times that of the uncompensated system H2 S , as a result of Desc Clms Page number 33 which the bandwidth BW of the system HS was increased by a factor of substantially three to BWc. At this juncture, the compensated system H3 S is preferably analyzed with reference to the.system s overshoot Os and settling time ts based on a calculation of the system damping factor df and the assumption that the system will settle in five times constants, i.e., ts 5tx. The relevant values may be calculated or estimated, as the case may be, from the expressions, for df, os, tx and ts shown in Fig. 15. In connection with this analysis, reference is also made to the typical mailing machines hereinbefore described, wherein a maximum drum cycle time period Tct Fig. 3 of 234 milliseconds and a maximum mailpiece transport speed Fig. 2 of 61 inches per second are typical values. Assuming the velocity profile of Fig. 3, and, as previously discussed an acceleration time period of Ta 37 milliseconds, a constant velocity time period of Tc 124 milliseconds and decceleration time period of Td 24 milliseconds, the longest permissible settling time for the sys.tem was calculated, i.e., Tct Ta Tc Td 234 185 49 milliseconds. For analysis purposes a series of calculations of the aforesaid system characteristics and phas.e margin were performed, assuming incremental increases in the overall system gain Ko, while holding fz fl. The results of such calculations are shown in the following Table III.

Although this results in an increase in system overshoot Os accompanied by a negligible decrease in the settling time ts, the settling time ts is well within the maximum allowable settling time, Ts 49 milliseconds. On the other hand, if a bandwidth of.400 radians per second is acceptable, it is desirable to reduce th percentage of overshoot Os, and increase the phase margin to mc 50 to provide for greater system stability than would be available with a phase margin value i.e., 46 which is substantially equal to the design criteria minimum of 45 in which instance it is preferable to choose the bandwidth of BW 400 radians per second, overshoot of Os 28 and compensated phase margin of mc 50 . For the example given, a compensated Bandwidth of BWc 400 radians per second is acceptable inasmuch as worst case load conditions were assumed. In this connection it is noted tha.t the foregoing analysis is based on controlling a postage meter drum, which has a high moment of inertia, contributes high system friction, and Desc Clms Page number 35 calls for a cyclical start stop mode of operation during which the load follows a predetermined displacement versus time trajectory to accommodate the maximum mailpiece transport speed in a typical mailing machine. Accordingly, the compensated system bandwidth BWc 400 radians per second may be chosen, as a result of which the overall system gain Ko may be fixed at Ko 400, and the value of Kc may be calculated from the expression Kc Ko Kv Ka Kp . Since fz fl, and fl and fp are also known, the Bode plot of the compensator D S , Fig. 14, may be added to the Bode diagram Fig. 13 wherein the system compensator D S shown as a dashed line. Since the analog compensator D S was derived,in the frequency domain, D S was converted to its Z transform equivalent D Z in the sampled data domain for realization in the form of a numerical algorithm for implementation by a computer. Of the numerous well known techniques for transforming a function in the frequency domain to a function in the sampled data domain, the bi linear transformation may be chosen. For bi linear transformation purposes the Laplace operator S is defined by the expression shown in Fig. 16. Using the values Kc 13.64, fz fl 48, and fp 3,400 in the expression for D S in Fig. 14, and substituting the bi linear transformation expression for S shown in Fig. 16 and the sampling interval T l millisecond, in the expression shown in Fig. 14 results in the expression for D Z shown in Fig. 17. As shown in Fig. 11, D T output input g T e T , which, in the sampled data domain is expressed by the Desc Clms Page number 36 equation D Z G Z E Z . Accordingly, the expression for D Z shown in Fig. 17 may be rewritten as shown in Fig. 18a. Cross multiplying the equivalency of Fig. 18a results in the expression shown in Fig. 18b, which defines the output G Z in the sampled data domain of the system compensator D S . Taking the inverse Z transform of the. ,expression shown in Fig. 18b, results in the expression shown in Fig. 19 which defines the output G Tn in the time domain of the system compensator D S , and is a numerical expression of the algorithm to be implemented by the computer for system compensation purposes. As shown by the expression in Fig. 19 and in the following Table IV the output of the digital compensator for any current sampling instant Tn is a function of the position error at the then current sampling time instant Tn, is a function of the position error at the end of the next previous sampling time instant Tn 1 and is a function of the algorithm output at the end of the next previous sampling time instant Tn 1.

As shown in Fig. 20 the computer 500 preferably includes a conventional, inexpensively commercially available, high speed microprocessor 502, such as the Model 8051 single chip microprocessor commercially available from Intel Corporation, 3065 Bowers Avenue, Santa Clara, California 95051. The microprocessor 502, generally comprises a plurality of discrete circuits, including those of a control processor unit or CPU 504, an oscillator and clock 506, a program memory 508, a data memory 510, timer and event counters 512, programmable serial ports 514, programmable I O ports 516 and control circuits 518, which are respectively constructed and arranged by well known means for executing instructions from.the program memory 508 that pertain to internal data, data from the clock 506, data memory 510, timer and event counter 512, serial ports 514, I O ports 514 interrupts 520 and or bus 522 and providing appropriate outputs from the clock 506, serial ports 514, I O ports 516 and timer 512. A more detailed discussion of the internal structural and functional characteristics and Desc Clms Page number 38 features of the Model 8051 microprocessor, including optional methods of programming port 3 for use as a conventional bidirectional port, may be found in the Intel Corporation publication entitled MCS 51 Family of Single Chip Microcomputers Users Manual, dated January 1981. For implementing the sampling time period of T l millisecond, one of the microprocessor s timer and event counters 512 Fig. 20 is conventionally programmed as a sampling time period clock source. To that end, a timer 512 is programmed for providing an interrupt signal each 250 microseconds, and each successive fourth interrupt signal is utilized as a clock signal for timing the commencement of successive sampling time periods of T l millisecond. In general, as shown in Fig. 21, at the commencement of each sampling time period of T l millisecond, during the sampling instant Tn, a sample is taken of the count representative of the actual angular displacement of the motor drive shaft and, substantially immediately thereafter, the actual count is summed with the count representative of the desired angular displacement of the motor drive shaft which was calculated during the next preceeding time period T in order to obtain the then current error value E T for calculating the then current compensation algorithm output value G Tn . Due to the recursive mathematical expression for G Tn Fig. 19 being a function of the then current error value E Tn , the next previous error value E Tn 1 and the next previous compensation algorithm output value G Tn 1 , the expression for G Tn is preferably separated Desc Clms Page number 39 into two components for calculation purposes, i. e., G Tn g1 g2 wherein g1 Kl x E Tn , and wherein g2 K2 x E Tn 1 K3 x G Tn 1 , to permit calculation of the value of 92 in advance of the time period T when it is to be added to the value of g1 for calculating the value of G Tn , thereby reducing to a negligible value in view of the time period T the time delay Tdy before completion of sampling the actual displacement of the motor drive shaft at the instant Tn and applying the PWM motor control signal to the output ports of the microprocessor. For example, when calculating the value of G Tn based upon the first error value resulting from the summation of the counts representing the desired and actual angular displacements of the motor drive shaft, the value of g2 is by definition equal to,.zero since the error signal E Tn 1 is equal to zero, due to the. desired and actual angular displacement values during the next previous sampling time period T having been equal to each other. Accordingly, upon obtaining the value of the first error signal El Tn , the value of Gl Tn may.be calculated as being equivalent to g1, i.e., Gl Tn g1 K1 x E1 Tn . And, upon calculating Gl Tn the value of g2 for use in calculating the next successive compensation algorithm output value G Tn l may be calculated for subsequent use, since 92 Tn l K2 x El Tn K3 x G1 Tn , and K2, K3, E1 Tn and Gl Tn are all known values. In addition, during any given time period T, a calculation may be made of the desired angular displacement of the motor drive shaft for the next subsequent time period T. Preferably, the Desc Clms Page number 40 microprocessor is programmed for implementation of the aforesaid calculation process to facilitate early utilization of the compensation algorithm output value G Tn for driving the D. C. motor. Accordingly, the microprocessor is preferably programmed for during the first sampling time period T1, sampling the count representative of the actual angular displacement of the motor drive shaft at the time instant Tn, then taking the summation of that count and the previously calculated value of the desired angular displacement of the motor drive shaft to obtain the first error value El Tn , then calculating the first compensation algorithm output value Gl Tn K1 x El Tn g2, wherein 92 0, and generating a PWM motor control signal representative of Gl Tn , then calculating the value of g2 for the next sampling time period, i.e., g2 K2 x E1 Tn K3 x Gl Tn , and then calculating the count representing the desired angular displacement of the motor drive shaft for use during the next sampling time period T2 during the second sampling time period T2, sampling the count representative of the actual angular displacement of the motor drive shaft and taking the summation of that count and the previously calculated desired count to obtain the error value E2 Tn 1 , calculating the compensation algorithm output value G2 Tn l K1 x E2 Tn 1 g2 Kl x E2 Tn 1 K2 x El Tn K3 x G1 Tn , and generating a PWM motor control signal representative thereof, then calculating the value of g2 for the next sampling time period T3, i. e., g2 K2 x E2 Tn 1 K3 x G2 Tn l , and then calculating the count representative Desc Clms Page number 41 of the desired angular displacement of the motor drive shaft for use during the time period T3 and so on, during each successive sampling time period. Accordingly, as shown in Fig. 21, the microprocessor is programmed for immediately after calculating the then current compensation algorithm output value G Tn , and thus while the calculation of the value., of g2 for the next sampling time period is in progress, generating a motor control signal for energizing the power amplifier. For this purpose, the relative voltage levels of motor control signal are determined by the sign, i. e., plus or minus, of the compensation algorithm output value G Tn , and the duty cycle of the control signal is determined by the absolute value of the compensation algorithm output value G Tn . Preferably, for timing the duration of the motor control signal, the other timer and event counter 512, i. e., the timer 512 which was not used as a sampling time period clock source, is utilized for timing the duration of the duty cycle of the motor control signal. For example, by loading the absolute value of the G Tn into the other timer 512, commencing the count, and timely invoking an interrupt for terminating the duty cycle of the control signal. As shown in Fig. 21 c , the time delay Tdy from commencement of the time period T to updating the PWM motor control signal at the output ports of the microprocessor is substantially 55 microseconds, and the time interval allocated for calculating the value of g2 and the count representative of the desired angular displacement of the motor drive shaft for use during the next time period Desc Clms Page number 42 is substantially 352 microseconds. As a result, substantially 593 microseconds of microprocessor calculation time is available during any given sampling time period T l millisecond for implementing non motor control applications. As shown in Fig. 22 the computer 500 is preferably modularly constructed for segregating the components of the logic circuit 501a and analog circuit 501b of the computer 500 from each other. To that end, the respective circuits 501a and 501b may be mounted on separate printed circuit boards which are electrically isolated from each other and adapted.to be interconnected by means of connectors located along the respective dot dash lines 516,527 and 528. In any event, the components of the logic circuit 521a and analog circuit 521b are preferably electrically isolated from each other. To that end, the logic circuit 501a preferably includes 5V and ground leads from the mailing machine s power supply for providing the logic circuit 501a with a local 5 volt source 530 having 5V and GND leads shunted by filter capacitors Cl and C2. And the analog circuit 501b includes 30 volt and ground return leads from the mailing machine s power supply for providing the analog circuit 501b with a local 30 volt source 536 including 30V and GND leads shunted by filter capacitors C3 and C4. In addition, the analog circuit 501b includes a conventional 30 volt detection circuit 542 having its input conventionally connected to the analog circuit s 30 volt source 536, and its output coupled to a power up down lead from the analog circuit via a conventional optical electrical isolator circuit 544. Desc Clms Page number 43 Further, to provide the analog circuit 501b with a local 5 volt source 546, the analog circuit 501b is equipt with a conventional regulated power supply having its input appropriately connected to the analog circuit s 30 volt source 536 via a series connected resistor Rl and a 5 volt, voltage regulator 548. A zener diode Dl, having its cathode shunted to ground and having its anode connected to the input of the 5V regulator 548 and also connected via the resistor Rl to the 30 volt terminal line, is provided for maintaining the input to the 5V regulator 548 at substantially a 5 volt level. In addition, a pair of capacitors C5 and C6 are provided across the output of the regulator 548 for filtration purposes. To accommodate interfacing the postage meter s computer 41 Fig. 1 with the computer 500, any two available ports of the computer 41 may be programmed for two way serial communications purposes and coupled to the computer 500. For example, the postage meter s printing module 41a may be conventionally modified to include an additional two way serial communications channel for communication with the computer 500. Assuming the latter arrangement, serial input communications to the computer 500 Fig. 22 are received from the postage meter computer s printing module 41c via the serial input lead to the logic circuit 501a Fig. 22 , which is operably coupled to port P30 of the microprocessor 502 by means of a conventional inverting buffer circuit 550. Accordingly, port P30 is preferably programmed for serial Desc Clms Page number 44 input communications, and the input to the buffer circuit 550 is resistively coupled to the logic circuit s 5 volt source 530 via a conventional pull up resistor R2. Serial output communications from the microprocessor 502 are transmitted from port P31. Accordingly, port P31 is preferably programmed for serial output communications, and is operably coupled to the input of a conventional inverting buffer 552, the output of which is resistively coupled to the logic circuit s 5V source 530 via a suitable pull up resistor R2 and is additionally electrically connected to the serial output lead from the logic circuit 501a. Since it is preferable that the microprocessor 502 be reset in response to energization of the logic circuit 501a, the logic circuit s 5V source 530 is connected in series with an R C delay circuit and a conventional inverting buffer circuit 554 to the reset pin, RST, of the microprocessor 502. The R C circuit includes a suitable resistor R3 which is connected in series with the logic circuit s local 5V source 530 and a suitable capacitor C7 which has one end connected between the resistor R3 and the input to the buffer circuit 554, and the other end connected to the logic circuit s ground return. In addition to the VCC and VSS terminals of the microprocessor 502 being respectively conventionally connected to the logic circuit s 5 volt source and ground, since the microprocessor 502 does not utilize an external program memory, the EA terminal is connected to the logic circuit s 5V source. And, since no other external memory is Desc Clms Page number 45 position lead of the logic circuit, which, in turn, is connected to one input of a differential amplifier 562, the output of which is connected to the other input of the differential amplifier 562 via a feedback resistor R4. The aforesaid other input to the amplifier 562 is also resistively coupled, by means of a resistor R5, to the mid point of a voltage divider circuit including resistors R6 and R7. Resistors R6 and R7 are connected in series with each other and across the logic circuit s 5V source and ground return leads. The LED sensors 56 and 58, which are utilized for successively sensing the leading edges of each envelope being fed by the letter transport, are separately coupled to the computer 500 via the envelope sensor 1 and envelope sensor 2 input leads of the logic circuit 501a. In the logic circuit 501a, the envelope sensor 1 and sensor 2 leads are connected on a one for one basis to one of the inputs of a pair of conventional amplifiers 564, the other inputs of which are connected together and to the mid point of a voltage divider including resistors R8 and R9. Resistors R8 and R9 are connected in series with each other and across the logic circuit s 5V source and ground return leads. Further, the three output signals from the differential amplifier 562 and the two amplifiers 564 are connected on a one for one basis to the three input ports POO 2 of the microprocessor 502, each via a conventional tri state buffer circuit 566, one of which is shown. The input signals A and B from the D. C. motor shaft encoder 126 are coupled to the logic circuit 501a Desc Clms Page number 46 position lead of the logic circuit, which, in turn, is connected to one input of a differential amplifier 562, the output of which is connected to the other input of the differential amplifier 562 via a feedback resistor R4. The aforesaid other input to the amplifier 562 is also resistively coupled, by means of a resistor R5, to the midpoint of a voltage divider circuit including resistors R6 and R7. Resistors R6 and R7 are connected in series with each other and across the logic circuit s 5V source and ground return leads. The LED sensors 56 and 58, which are utilized for successively sensing the leading edges of each envelope being fed by the letter transport, are separately coupled to the computer 500 via the envelope sensor 1 and envelope sensor 2 input leads of the logic circuit 501a. In the logic circuit 501a, the envelope sensor 1 and sensor 2 leads are connected on a one for one basis to one of the inputs of a pair of conventional amplifiers 564, the other inputs of which are connected together and to he mid point of a voltage divider including resistors R8 and R9. Resistors R8 and R9 are connected in series with each other and across the logic circuit s 5V source and ground return leads. Further, the three output signals from the differential amplifier 562 and the two amplifiers 564 are connected on a one for one basis to the three input ports POO 2 of the microprocessor 502, each via a conventional tri state buffer circuit 566, one of which is shown. The input signals A and B from the D. C. motor shaft encoder 126 are coupled to the logic circuit 501a Desc Clms Page number 47 by means of leads A and B, which are conventially electrically connected to the counting circuit 270 to provide the microprocessor 502 the the count representative of the actual angular displacement of the motor shaft 122 from its home position. The counting circuit s leads QO Q7 are electrically connected on a one for one basis to Ports PO0PO7 of the microcomputer 502 via one of eight conventional tri state buffer circuits 568, one of which is shown, having their respective control input leads connected to each other and to the output of a conventional inverting buffer circuit 570, which has its input conventionally connected port P34 of the microprocessor 502. Thus, either the three input signals, i. e., from the drum home position and the two envelope position sensors are operably electrically coupled to Ports PO0 PO2 of the microprocessor 502, or the eight input signals QO Q7 from the counter circuit 270 are operably electrically coupled to ports PO0 PO7 of the microprocessor 502, for scanning purposes, in response to an appropriate control signal being applied to the respective buffer circuits 566 and 568 from port P34 of the microprocessor 502.... In operation, assuming a low logic level signal is required for activating either of the sets of buffers 566 or 568 when the microprocessor 502 applies such a signal to port P34, the buffer circuits 566 operate, whereas since the buffer circuit 570 inverts this signal to a high logic level signal before applying the same to the buffer circuit 568, the latter is inoperative. Conversely, a high logic level signal from port P34 will operate buffer circuits 568 and not operate the Desc Clms Page number 48 buffer circuits 566. Accordingly, depending upon the level, high or low, of the signal from port P34 of the microprocessor 502, the eight bit input to one or the other buffer circuits 566 or 568 will be made available to port PO for scanning purposes. Aside from the foregoing, to permit the microprocessor 502 to clear the counter 270 for any reason in the course of execution of the program, port P35 is connected to.the.,clear pin CLR of the counter 270 via a conventional inverting buffer 572, and the microprocessor 502 is programmed for timely applying the appropriate signal to port P35 which, when inverted, causes the counting circuit 270 to be cleared. ,In general, ports P10 P13 are utilized by the microprocessor 502 for providing pulse width modulated PWM motor control signals for controlling energization of the D. C. motor 120 and port Pl4 is utilized by the microprocessor 502 for controlling energization of the solid state, A. C. motor, relay 52 and thus operation of the mailpiece conveyor 49. To that end, ports Pl0 Pl4 of the microprocessor 502 are each conventionally electrically connected on a one for one basis to the input of a conventional inverting buffer circuit 580, one of which is shown. The outputs of each of the buffer circuits 580 are connected on a one for one basis, via a conventional resistor RIO, to output leads from the logic circuit 501b, one of which is designated solid state, A.C. motor, relay, and four of which are respectively designated Tl, T3, T2 and T4, since, as shown in Fig. 7, the four preamplifier stages of the power amplifier utilized for Desc Clms Page number 49 opto isolator s photo transistor when the light emitting diode Dl is lit in response to the D. C. supply voltage level matching the internal reference voltage level, e. g., 30 volts, of the 30 volt detection circuit. In the analog circuit 501b each of the outputs from the photo transistors of each of the opto isolators 303 are resistively coupled to the analog circuits 5V source by means of a conventional pull up resistor 305, and the emitters of the photo transistors T5 are connected to the analog circuit s ground system. In addition, the collectors of the photodiodes of the opto isolators 303, which are utilized for transmitting the motor control signals from ports Pl0 Pl3 of the microprocessor 502 are connected on a one for one basis to the appropriate input leads A, B, C and D of the power amplifiers shown in Fig. 7, the outputs of which are connected to,the D.C. motor 120. Further, the collector of the photodiode of the opto isolator 303 which is utilized for transmitting the A.C. relay control signals from port Pl4 of the microprocessor 502 is connected to the input lead of a conventional darlington type power amplifier 550, the output of which is conventionally connected to the mailing machine s 30 volt D. C. source via a solid state, A.C. motor, relay 52, which is turn conventionally connected for energizing the A.C. motor 50 from the local A. C. source. In general, the computer 500 includes three software programs, including a main line program Fig. 23, a transmit and receive program and a command execution program, respectively identified by the 600,700 and 800 series of Desc Clms Page number 50 opto isolator s photo transistor when the light emitting diode Dl is lit in response to the D. C. supply voltage level matching the internal reference voltage level, e. g., 30 volts, of the 30 volt detection circuit. In the analog circuit 501b each of the outputs from the photo transistors of each of the opto isolators 303 are resistively coupled to the analog circuits 5V source by means of a conventional pull up resistor 305, and the emitters of the photo transistors T5 are connected to the analog circuit s ground system. In addition, the collectors of the photodiodes of the opto isolators 303, which are utilized for transmitting the motor control signals from ports P10 P13 of the microprocessor 502 are connected on a one for one basis to the appropriate input leads A, B, C and D of the power amplifiers shown in Fig. 7, the outputs of which are connected to the D. C. motor 120. Further, the collector of the photodiode of the opto isolator 303 which is utilized for transmitting the A,C. relay control signals from port P14 of the microprocessor 502 is connected to the input lead of a conventional darlington type power amplifier 550, the output of which is conventionally connected to the mailing machine s 30 volt D. C. source via a solid state, A.C. motor, relay 52, which is turn conventionally connected for energizing the A.C. motor 50 from the local A.C. source. In general, the computer 500 includes three software programs, including a main line program Fig. 23, a transmit and receive program and a command execution program, respectively identified by the 600,700 and 800 series of Desc Clms Page number 51 numbers. When the mailing machine 10 is energized by actuation of the main power switch 24, the resulting low level logic signal from D. C. supply is applied to the reset terminal RST of the computer s microprocessor 502, thereby enabling the microprocessor 502. Whereupon, as shown in Fig. 23, the microprocessor 502 commences execution of the main line program 600. The main line program 600 Fig. 23 commences with the step of conventionally initializing the microprocessor 602, which generally includes establishing the initial voltage levels at the microprocessor s ports, and interrupts, and setting the timers and counters. Thereafter, the D.C. motor drive unit is initialized 604. Step 604 entails scanning the motor home position sensor input port PO0, to determine whether or not the D. C. motor 120 is located in its home position and, if it is not, driving the motor 120 to its home position. Assuming the D. C. motor 120 is in its home position, either before or after the initialization step 604, the program then enters an idle loop routine 606. In the idle loop routine 606,. a determination is .initially made as to whether or not the sampling time period of T l millisecond has elapsed, step 608, it being noted that each successive sample is, taken at the time instant Tn immediately after and in response to the fourth 250 millisecond interrupt generated by the timer utilized for implementing the sampling time period T. Assuming the time period T has not elapsed, the program loops to idle 606. On the other hand, assuming the time period T has elapsed, the Desc Clms Page number 52 microprocessor 502 updates the servo control system, step 610. For the purpose of explaining step 610 it will be assumed until otherwise stated that the desired location of the postage meter drum 38, and thus the motor drive shaft 122, is the home position. Step 610 includes the successive steps 610a and 610b, respectively, of sampling the count of the actual position Pa of the motor drive shaft 122 at the sampling time instant Tn, and fetching the previously cpmputed count representing the desired position Pd of the shaft 122 at the same sampling time instant Tn. If for any reason the motor drive shaft 122 is not located in its home position when the value of the desired position count Pd Tn is representative of the home position location, then the values of Pa Tn and Pd Tn will be different. On the other hand, if the motor drive shaft 122 is located in its home position when the desired position count Pd Tn is representative of the home position location, then the values of Pa Tn and Pd Tn will be the same. Accordingly, computation of the error count, 610c, may or may not result .in an error .count. value E Tn of zero. Further, independently of the computed value of E Tn , the computed value G Tn of the motor control signal, step 601d, may or may not result in a value of G Tn of zero it being noted that although step 610c results in a computed value of E Tn 0, the value of g2 may not be equal to zero due to the computed value of the error for the next previous sampling time instant E Tn 1 having resulted in a non zero value,step 610g. Assuming steps 610c and 610d both result in zero Desc Clms Page number 53 shaft 122 out of the home position, until a mailpiece 16 is fed to the drum 38. At this juncture it will be assumed that the enable flag is set, as a result of which the inquiry of step 612 is answered affirmatively, or, as above stated, a mailpiece 16 is being fed to the drum 38. Accordingly, the microprocessor 502 commences polling the ports connected to the envelope sensors 56 and 58, step 614. Since polling occurs at one millisecond time intervals, the polling sequence is continuous. As shown by the following step 616, between successive time instants Tn, the program continuously loops to idle 606 and through steps 608 616 inclusive until the envelope sensing sequence for a given envelope is complete. Whereupon the microprocessor commences executing step 618, which includes the steps of calculating the envelope s velocity, 618a then fetching from memory the corresponding acceleration, deceleration and constant velocity constants, 618b, for computation of the desired position counts Pd at each successive time instant Tn in advance of sampling the actual position counts Pa as hereinbefore discussed in connection with step 610 then fetching and implementing the time delay td for timely commencing acceleration of the drum 38 to the target velocity VI and then commencing drum rotation by generating the desired position Pd for the initial one millisecond sampling time instant of acceleration of the motor drive shaft 122 and storing the value for subsequent use in step 601b. Accordingly, the value of Pd Desc Clms Page number 54 shaft 122 out of the home position, until a mailpiece 16 is fed to the drum 38. At this juncture it will be assumed that the enable flag is set, as a result of which the inquiry of step 612 is answered affirmatively, or, as above stated, a mailpiece 16 is being fed to the drum 38. Accordingly, the microprocessor 502 commences polling the ports connected to the envelope sensors 56 and 58, step 614. Since polling occurs at one millisecond time intervals, the polling sequence is continuous. As shown by the following step 616, between successive time instants Tn, the program continuously loops to idle 606 and through steps 608 616 inclusive until the envelope sensing sequence for a given envelope is complete. Whereupon the microprocessor commences executing step 618, which includes the steps of calculating the envelope s velocity, 618a then fetching from memory the corresponding acceleration, deceleration and constant velocity constants, 618b, for computation of the desired position counts Pd at each successive time instant Tn in advance of sampling the actual position counts Pa as hereinbefore discussed in connection with step 610 then fetching and implementing the time delay td for timely commencing acceleration of the drum 38 to the target velocity V1 and then commencing drum rotation by generating the desired position Pd for the initial one millisecond sampling time instant of acceleration of the motor drive shaft 122 and storing the value for subsequent use in step 601b. Accordingly, the value of Pd Desc Clms Page number 55 will no longer be assumed to be the value representative of the home position. Thereafter, the inquiry is made as to whether or not the drum cycle is complete, step 620. Assuming as stated above that only the initial desired value of Pd has been computed and stored, the inquiry of step 620 will be answered in the negative. Whereupon the microprocessor 502 transmits a status message, step 622, to the postage meter s computer 41 and the program loops to idle 606. Thereafter the microprocessor 502 continuously executes steps 608 620 until the entire Pd count sequence 618d for the trapazoidal shaped velocity versus time profile for the target velocity VI has been exhausted. In this connection it is noted that the drum cycle Tct is not complete until the settling time interval Ts which is allowed for damping any overshoot of the motor drive shaft 122 is complete. During the settling time interval Ts the value of Pd is a constant and representative of the home position of the shaft 122 and thus the drum 38. Assuming that the drum cycle is complete, the inquiry of step 620 will be answered affirmatively. Whereupon the microprocessor..502 transmits a status message, step 624, to the postage meter s computer 41 and the program loops to idle 606. Thereafter, the foregoing steps 606 622 of the main line, servo control, idle loop are continuously executed by the microprocessor 502 in accordance with the above discussion until the main power switch 24 is opened by the operator. The serial communications program 700 includes the transmit status routine 704. The latter routine 704 includes Desc Clms Page number 56 the steps of receiving and decoding any message, step 706, and invoking the execute command routine, step 708, both of which steps are self explanatory. Assuming the execute command routine 800 has been invoked, step 708, the microprocessor 502 executes the routine 800 commencing with the step 802 of inquiring whether or not the decoded message is an enable command. Assuming the answer is yes, an enable status flag is set, step 804, to indicate that an envelope is to be fed to the drum 38. Whereupon the A. C. motor relay 52 is energized, step 806, for feeding the envelope to the drum 38, and the transmit status routine is invoked, step 808. On the other hand, assuming the decoded message is not an enable command, step 802, a enable status flag is cleared, step 810. Whereupon the A.C. relay is deenergized, step 812, and the status transmit routine is invoked 808. Assuming the status transmit routine 7Q2 has been invoked, step 806, the microprocessor 502 executes the routine 702 commencing with the step 710 of inquiring whether or not the drum cycle is complete. Assuming eompletion of the drum cycle, a drum cycle complete message, is transmitted to the postage meter s computer 41, step 712, On the other hand, assuming the drum cycle is not complete, an inquiry is made as to whether or not the A. C. relay is energized, step 716, and, if it is, an A.C. relay energized message is transmitted to the postage meter s computer 41, step 718. If however the drum cycle is not complete, step 710, apd the A. C. relay is not energized, step 716, then, an A.C. relay Desc Clms Page number 57 deenergized message is transmitted to the postage meter s computer 41, step 720. Upon transmitting any of the messages, drum cycle complete, step 710, A. C. relay energized, step 716,.or A. C. relay deenergized, step 720, the microprocessor 502 returns to the idle 606 of the main line program 600.
