# Semiconductor laser and method of making same.

## Abstract
A semiconductor laser having mirror faces 7, 8 serv ing as resonators, in which the active laser region 2 com prises end zones 11 adjoining the mirror faces 7, 8 and comprise implanted ions, preferably protons, with associ ated crystal damage. The end zones 11 have a length which is at least equal to the diffusion length of the recom bining charge carriers in the end zones. As a result of the high recombination rate in the end zones 11 substantially no non radiating recombination occurs at the mirror faces 7, 8 so that mirror erosion is avoided. The invention also relates to a method in which the end zones 11 are formed by an ion bombardment on the upper surface of the semiconductor wafer with a number of lasers, which wafer at the area of the mirror cleavage faces to be formed is provided with grooves 20 which do not extent up to the active layer 3 , in which grooves 20 the end zones 11 are provided via an ion bombardment through the active layer 3 .
