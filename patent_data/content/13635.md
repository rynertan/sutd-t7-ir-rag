# Method and apparatus for producing rubber melt.

## Abstract
When pieces of rubber are melted and decomposed in a screw extruder, a rubber melt can be produced without necessarily using a heavy oil and with minimized evolution of gas, this result being achieved by controlling the extruder cylinder temperature in a decomposition section of the screw within the range of 400 to 500 C and cooling the melt in the discharge section of the screw to a temperature of not more than 250 C. A screw extruder suited for practising this method comprises a screw 1 having a feed section A , a compres sion section B , a decomposition section C and a discharge section D which are arranged in that order from the inlet 9 , and a cylinder assembly 4 consisting of a heating cylinder 5 and a cooling cylinder 6 arranged in that order from the inlet 9 , the feed compression and decomposition section A,B and C of the screw 1 being located to correspond to said heating cylinder 5 , and the discharge section D of the screw 1 being located to correspond to said cooling cylinder 6 .
