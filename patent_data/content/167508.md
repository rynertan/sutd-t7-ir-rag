# Method and apparatus for fibrating molten mineral material.

## Abstract
A method and an apparatus in a plant for fibrating mineral molten material which in the form of a stream of molten material 4 is discharged to the peripheral surface of a primary spinner wheel 1 and which is formed to mineral fibres by being thrown out from the spinner wheel or from several cooperating spinner wheels. The distribution of the stream of molten material 4 over the width or length of the primary spinner wheel is improved in that the force is applied to the incoming stream of molten material 4 , especially from rear side thereof as seen in the rotation direction of the spinner wheel as seen in the rotation direction of the spinner wheel, which force is acting in a plane substantially perpendicular to a generatrics to the peripheral surface of the spinner wheel 1 and in a blunt angle to the stream of molten material 4 . The force acts on a stream of molten material a short distance in advance of the place where the material comes into contact with the spinner wheel 1 , and the force provides a widening of the stream of molten material without breaking same up into small fragments. The force may be provided by a gas now 5 or by different mechanical deflector means.
