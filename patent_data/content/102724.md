# PUMPING SYSTEM FOR PRODUCING A LIQUID JET

## Abstract
A piston pump 10 for delivering intermittent liquid jets through a nozzle pumps liquid from a reservoir through an inlet valve 24 , pump chamber 27 , outlet orifice 21 , fluid coupling 18 , and outlet conduit to the nozzle of a miniatu rised appliance having a reduced reservoir height and reduced piston stroke, relative to standard units, tending to jeopardise consistent priming of the pump under a pressure head provided by a reduced liquid column in the filled reservoir. The fluid coupling 18 has a first tubular member 46 extending from the outlet orifice 21 a second tubular member 47 extending around and being removable from the first tubular member and having the outlet conduit connected thereto, and consistent priming of the pump at the reduced reservoir height and reduced piston stroke is assured by an outlet check valve 48 located in the first tubular member and biased toward the outlet orifice.
