# Lamp post having a reinforcement of the aperture in the lower portion.

## Abstract
Lamp post or the like from tubular extruded aluminum or aluminum alloy, having at its lower portion 1 an aperture 2 adapted to be closed by a door. The aperture 2 is bridged by a reinforcement 3 arranged within the post. Similarly, an aperture 4 preferably slightly smaller is provided in the reinforcement 3. The reinforcement 3 extends by some distance above and beneath the aperture 2 in the wall 1 of the post and is connected to the inner side of the post. The reinforcement 3 is in shape of a rectangular shield 3 bent transversely in form of a portion of a cylinder. The outer diameter of said shield 3 is substantially equal to the inner diameter of the post 1. The shield 3 is connected to the internal side of the lamp post 1 only by glueing.

## Claims

## Description
Lamp post having a reinforcement of the aperture in the lower portion. The invention relates to a lamp post or the like from tubular extruded aluminum or aluminum alloy, in which at the lower portion, in the wall of the post an aperture is provided adapted to be closed by a door, said aperture is bridged by a reinforcement arranged within the post and in which similarly, is located an aperture preferably slightly smaller, said reinforcement extends by a certain distance above and beneath the aperture into the wall of the post and is connected to the inner side of the post. Such a lamp post is known from the Dutch Patent Application 71.14828. Therein, the reinforcement consists of a tube portion having a smaller diameter than the internal diameter of the.post at the aperture. After inserting the reinforcing tube, this is expanded permanently in radial direction against the inner side of the post.Eventually, an adhering layer may be provided yet between the reinforcing tube and the post. Such a reinforcement at the aperture within which the operation apparatus, such as fuses and choke is mounted, is necessary for preventing the post from rupture by wind load and or intentional destruction. Sometimes, vandales try to break a lamp post by longterm moving it reciprocally. Providing and expanding a reinforcing tube in the known lamp post is labour consuming and thus expensive.Moreover, the post is also reinforced at the side opposite the aperture and there a reinforcement is not necessary, by which so, unnecessary material is used. The invention has the object to provide a lamp post in which with less labour and less material a positively well reinforcement may be obtained. According to the invention this is achieved in that the reinforcement is in shape of a rectangular shield bent transversely in form of a portion of a cylinder the outer diameter of which is substantially equal to the inner diameter of the post, which shield is connected to the internal side of the lamp post only by glueing. Preferably the shield extends transversely upto nearly the central longitudinal surface of the post being parallel to the aperture. Further, preitiaby tae thickness of the shied is higher tban the thickness of the post wail at the aperture. In this way only a relatively small reinforcing means is necks sary, which may be cut from a piece of extruded tube of higher wall thickness than the lamp post or which may be bent from shield material. Providing and adhering the shield may be carried out in a simple way. The invention will be explained in details with reference to the drawing in which an embodiment is represented. Fig. 1 is a longitudinal section through the lower portion of the lamp post according to the invention and Fig. 2 is a cross section through the line II II of Fig. 1. The lower portion of the lamp post from extruded aluminum is indicated by 1. In this lower portion is provided in known way an aperture 2 for arranging operation apparatus, not shown, for the lamp post. Said aperture is defined at top and bottom by two halves of circles and at the sides by straight circumscribing lines. Such a shape of the aperture is generally known. See also the Dutch PatentApplication 74.16458. The shield 3 is in shape of half a cylinder. Similarly, it is provided with an aperture 4 of the same shape as the aperture 2 but preferably slightly smaller, by which an abutment edge is formed for the door, not shown, and which should be provided in the aperture 2. For bringing the shield 3 in its position in the post 1 the respective surfaces or at least one of the surfaces is provided with a layer of epoxy glue 5 or the like. The shield 3 extends by some distance beyond the aperture 3 at the upper and lower side for having a sufficient adhering surface with the inner side of the post 1. It will be clear that the outer diameter of the shield 3 should be equal to the inner diameter of the post 1. By using saZd gluc conn2ction, at the external side the fixing means for the shield are not visible. Further, the complicated and expensive extrusion is eliminated thereby. The glue connection is effective over the entire surface of the shield 3 ba ich a very weL1. reinlorcement is atained. Preferably the thickness of the shield 3 is higher than the wall thickness of the post 1.
