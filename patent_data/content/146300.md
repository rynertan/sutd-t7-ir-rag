# Improvements in radial piston engines.

## Abstract
An internal combustion engine combines the efficiency of a radial engine with the practicality of a piston and crankshaft arrangement. A stationary frame supports a stationary sun gear, and a rotor is pivoted about the axis of the sun gear. The rotor carries three crankshafts at 120 intervals, each having an eccentric portion. For each crankshaft there is a cylinder in the rotor, a piston mounted for reciprocation in each cylinder, and a connecting rod from the piston to the eccentric portion of the corresponding crankshaft. Each crankshaft is fixed to rotate with a respective planetary gear, and all the planetary gears mesh with the sun gear and have the same pitch diameter as the sun gear, so that any point on the pitch circle of a plan etary gear describes a cardioid as the planetary gear rotates around the sun gear once. The crankshaft eccentricity is sub stantially 1 3 times the pitch radius of a planetary gear. The ec centric portion of each crankshaft has roller means rotatable about the same axis as the connection between the connecting rod and the eccentric portion, and a ring member with an inter nal surface surrounds and contacts all of the roller means simul taneously, the ring member being free to rotate about its own axis. Fuel metering means provide a combustible mixture for the cylinders, and ignition means are provided to ignite the combustible mixture in each cylinder. Three valves admit the combustible mixture to each cylinder, each valve having a valve shaft and a valve head at one end of the shaft. The shaft reciprocates in a bore of the rotor, the bore being substantially radially arranged with respect to the rotor axis. The shaft has at its end remote from the valve head a roller adapted to contact the inernal surface of the ring member over a fraction of each rotor revolution, thereby to depress the valve for the admission of the combustible mixture. Porting means are provided for ex hausting products of combustion from each cylinder.
