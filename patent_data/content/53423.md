# Shape selective reactions utilizing group III A metal modified zeolite catalyst.

## Abstract
A process for the conversion of aromatic compounds to dialkylbenzene compounds rich in the 1,4 dialkylben zene isomer. The reaction is carried out in the presence of a particular type of zeolite catalyst having a silica to alumina mole ration of at least 12 and a constraint index of about 1 12, said catalyst having been modified by treatment with compounds of scandium, yttrium and or samarium, and optionaiiy phosphorus, to deposit a minor proportion of such elements on the zeolite.
