# Hydroxyalkyl etherified glycolipid esters and their preparation.

## Abstract
The invention relates to novel hydroxyalkyl etherified glycolipid esters having both wax like properties and surface activity characteristics. The novel esters have the formula The novel esters can be produced by catalytically reacting the corresponding glycolipid ester or glycolipid in which all the hydroxyl groups of the sugar residues are free with ethylene or propylene oxide. The novel compounds can be used in many fields including the treatment of leather, cosmetics, and softening fibres.
