## Description
ORGANO PHOSPHORIC ESTERS, THEIR PRODUCTION AND USE rl le present invention relates to a range of phosphoro thioate or dithioate compounds, to the production of such compounds and to insecticidal acaricidal and or nematocidal compositions containing them as active ingredients. Insecticides, acaricides and nematocides have made a great contribution to a remarkable increase in agricultural production by virtue of their ability to knock down or kill various harmful insects which damage agricultural crops. However, various problems such as tonicity to mammals and pollution of the natural environment have appeared and developed to such an extent that the use of these effective insecticides, acaricides and nematocides is feared by some. For these reasons, there is a strong demand for the development of insecticides, acaricides and nematocides which are low in toxicity, free from fear of environmental pollution and effective in knocking down or killing various harmful insects. As a result of an extensive study directed to developing excellent insecticides, acaricides and nematocides satisfyin the above requirements, we have found a range of compounds which have properties meeting the above require ments, and have the combined properties of insecticidal, acaricidal and nematocidal activities. Such a compound within this range is a phosphorothioate or dithioate of the formula I ,EMI2.1 wherein R is a C1 C3 alkyl group, R1 is a C1 C3 alkoxy, C1 C4 alkylamino or allylamino group, R2 is a halogen 5 atom, a C1 C4 alkoxy or C1 C3 alkyl group, R3 is a hydrogen or halogen atom or a C1 C3 alkyl group, R4 is a C1 C3 alkyl group, and X is an oxygen or sulfur atom. The compound can be prepared by condensing a pyrimidine of the formula II , EMI2.2 wherein Y is a halogen atom, and R2, R and R4 are as defined above, with a thio or dithio phosphate of the formula III ,EMI3.1 wherein M is an alkali metal atom e.g. sodium, potassium or an ammonium group, and R, R1 and X are as defined above.
