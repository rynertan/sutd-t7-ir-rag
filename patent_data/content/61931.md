# Method and apparatus for stretching thermoplastic polymer films.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for stretching a thermoplastic polymer film 32 in which the opposite selvages 32a, 32b of the film are gripped by gripping means 12, 13 22, 23 and are stretched transversely during heating by moving the selvages along two divergent arcuate paths lying in the same plane and extending over a predetermincd circumferential range from a quater to a half of the full circumference of the circle containing the arcuate paths. In order to avoid drawbacks in the existing equipment such as irregular molecular orientation in and rupture of the film, the longitu dinal travel of the film 32 while being stretched is controlled by controlling means 33 so that the central web portion is advanced by substantially the same distance as the gripped film selvages 32a, 32b , whereby the amount of longitudinal movement of the film 32 is held always constant through out the width of the film.
