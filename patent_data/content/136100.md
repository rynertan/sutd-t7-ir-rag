## Description
Sucralfate is a disaccharide polysulfate aluminum compound useful in the treatment of duodenal ulcers. This invention provides the use of sucralfate in the preparation of a pharmaceutical suspension for use in the treatment by oral administration of ulcerative conditions of the esophagus. Sucralfate is a disaccharide polysulfate aluminum compound which is described in US A 3,432,489. Sucralfate is believed to be 3,4,5,6 tetra polyhydroxyaluminum alpha D glycopyranosyl sulfate 2,3,4,5 tetra polyhydroxyaluminum beta D fructofuranoside sulfate. Sucralfate is useful in the treatment of ulcers in the duodenum. Sucralfate is available in tablets which disintegrate rapidly in the stomach releasing the sucralfate for reaction with ulcer tissues in the duodenum. To date, sucralfate has not been available in a form which would render it effective in treatment of ulcerative conditions of the esophagus. The difficulty in formulating a sucralfate composition for such treatment has characteristically been due to the inability to supply sucralfate in a form which would be available in the esophagus. Formulations, including liquid formulations, have been tried without success. It has now been discovered that sulcralfate can be made available for treatment of ulcer tissues in the esophagus when formulated as a suspension which forms a sticky gel like or tacky viscous mass which settles to the bottom of a reaction vessel when added to 0.2 to 1.0 N hydrochloric acid. According to the invention there is provided the use of a disaccharide polysulfate aluminum compound in the preparation of a pharmaceutical suspension for use in the treatment by oral administration of ulcerative conditions of the esophagus, the suspension comprising a pharmaceutically effective amount of a disaccharide polysulfate aluminum compound containing 7 13 sulfur and 11 24 aluminum per molecule and a pharmaceutically acceptable suspending agent in an aqueous suspension, said suspension being capable of forming a viscous mass when added to 0.2 to 1.0 N hydrochloric acid, particularly 0.5 N hydrochloric acid. The suspension may additionally contain bodying agents, preservatives, antifoam agents, flavors and coloring agents. The invention will be described with specific reference to sucralfate. However, it should be understood that suspensions of other ulcer treating agents disclosed in US A 3,432,489 can be used in accordance with the present invention. That is, the use of any disaccharide polysulfate aluminum compound containing 7 13 sulfur and 11 24 aluminum per molecule is within the scope of the present invention. Preferably the composition is a suspension of sucralfate. The suspension is in a form which ensures that sucralfate is available to react with ulcer tissues in the esophagus with which it comes in contact after oral administration, in contrast to prior art sucralfate formulations in which sucralfate is not released until it reaches the stomach and duodenum. The only limitations on the amounts and types of suspending agents useful in the practice of the invention are 1 that they be pharmaceutically acceptable and 2 that when used with sucralfate, the resulting suspension forms a tacky viscous mass, which settles at least partially to the bottom of the reaction vessel, upon addition to 0.2 to 1 N hydrochloric acid. If, upon addition to the hydrochloric acid the particles remain suspended or there is no reaction, the suspension is not acceptable for the purposes of the present invention. The significance of the formation of the sticky mass is not fully understood. However, formulations of sucralfate which have this characteristic provide sucralfate to any ulcer tissue with which the suspension comes in contact after administration that is the sucralfate is available for reaction with ulcer tissues as soon as it passes through the oral cavity. The sucralfate suspension can be formulated from a wide range of suspending agents, including but not limited to gums, celluloses, clays and silicas and certain polymers, particularly vinyl or acrylic polymers. The following are representative of pharmaceutically acceptable suspending agents which can be employed in this invention acacia, agar, alginic acid, carrageenan, guar, pectin, tragacanth, xanthan, carboxymethylcellulose sodium, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, methylcellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, aluminum magnesium silicate, bentonite, hectorite, kaolin, colloidal silicon dioxide, polyacrylic acid, polyvinyl alcohol, and polyvinylpyrrolidone polymers. The suspension may contain suspension adjuvants to improve patient acceptance and quality of the product. Ingredients such as but not limited to glycerin, sorbitol, glucose and sugar, can be added to increase the body of the suspension. Preservatives such as but not limited to benzalkonium chloride, benzyl alcohol, parahydroxybenzoic acid esters and sorbic acid and its salts can be added to suppress growth of microorganisms. Antifoam agents such as the silicones can be added to dissipate foam produced when the product is shaken prior to use. Finally, flavors and color may be added to improve palatability. In preferred practice, sucralfate is formulated with microcrystalline cellulose, colloidal silicon dioxide and or methyl cellulose as the suspending agent. The preferred formulation and variations thereof which are acceptable for purposes of the present invention i.e. bring about the appropriate acid reaction are as follows In the above formulations, the sorbitol and glycerin are bodying agents the methylparaben is a preservative and the simethicone operates as an antifoaming agent. The microcrystalline cellulose, silicon dioxide and methylcellulose are the suspending agents. The following Example is illustrative of the invention. Unless the context requires otherwise, all percentages in the Example and elsewhere in this specification are weight percentages volume. The following compositions, which form a tacky viscous mass when added to 0.5 N hydrochloric acid, are within the invention
