As used herein Ac means acyl Bn means benzyl Bz means benzoyl Ph means phenyl Ms means mesyl and Me means methyl. Chart II Step 1 When R4 is a sulfonamide, this N deblocking transformation is effected by Red Al sodium bis methoxyethoxy aluminum hydride in THF toluene or glyme E. H. Gold and E. Babad, J. Org. Chem., 37, 2208 2210 1972 . This is described in detail for R4 S02CH3 in the following experiment. When R4 S02CH2COC6H5, the N deblocking can be done by Zn HOAc trace HCl J. B. Hendrickson and R. Bergeron, Tet. Lett., 345 1970 .When R11 C02CH2CH2I the R4 group can be removed by Ze CH30H at reflux J. Grimshaw, J. Chem. Soc., 7136 1965 . Similarly, Zn aq. THF,pH 4.2, can cleave R4 CO2CH2CCl3 G. Just and K. Grozinger, Synthesis, 457 1976 . Base 1M NaOH oleave R4 CO2CH2CH2SO2R2 G. I. Tesser and I. C. Balvert Geers, Int. J. Pept. Protein Res., 7, 295 1975 and A. T. Kader and C. J. M. Stirling, J. Chem. Soc., 2158 1964 .The benzyl carbamate R4 C02CH2Ph can be cleaved by hydrogenolysis M. Bergmann and L. Zervas, Ber., 65, 1192 1932 or by one of many newer methods in the art such as TMS I in CH3CN r. S. Lott, V. S. Chauhan and C. H. Stammer, J. Chem. Soc, Chem., Commun., 495 1979 . The 9 fluorenylmethyl carbamate can be cleaved by ammonia or other simple amines M. Brodanszky, S. S. Deshame and J. Martinez, J. Org. Chem., 44, 1622 1979 . Step 2 The indoline 2 can react with active acyl or sulfonyl compounds such as the chlorides or anhydrides, under conditions standard in the art inert solvent such as ether or EtOAc HX scavenger such as triethylamine to effect the N amidation. It can also be condensed with carboxylic acids in the presence or dehydrating agents such as carbodilmide. A convenient method for this approach is reaction or 2 with 1 equivalent of the carboxylic acid and 1 equivalent of EDC ethyldimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide inDMF L. Grehn and U. Ragnarsson,J. Org. Chem., 46, 3492 3497 1981 3. Alternatively, the condensation may be carried out with the commonly used dicyclohexylcarbodiimide in THF or DMF.It is not necessary to protect the alcohol functionality during this transformation. Compounds 3 in which R5 I i vii see Chart II can be prepared from commercially available activated acyl compounds or carboxylic acids by procedures generally known in the art. For R5 viii. the acids with X5 H, OH and OMe are commercially available. The 5 N02 compound is prepared by Fischer cyclization of ethylpyruvate p nitrophenylhydrazone in polyphosphoric acid S. M. Parmerter, A. G. Cook andW. B. Dixon, J. Amer. Chem. Soc., 80, 4621 1958 . This can be converted, by procedures standard in the art, to the NH2 derivative H2 PtO2 Fe HOAc and thence to the NHAc Ac2o , NHBz PhCOOH, EDC, DMF , andNHCNH2 NaHCO derivatives. The ureido compound can be converted C to the cyanamide with MSCl in pyridine.Alkylation of the indole nitrogen can be erected by procedures in the art such as NaH CH3I or C2H51. For R5 ix, the acid is prepared by DCC or EDC condensation or the acyl protected amino indole rrom viii with one or the acids in that group, followed by acyl deprotection. For R5 I x, the acid compound wherein X6 H was rirst prepared by R. J. S. Beer, K. Clarke,H. F. Davenport and A Robertson J. Chem. Soc., 2029 1951 . By analogy with the acids for R5 viii, nitration will give the 5w02 derivative, which can be converted to the other nitrogen functional groups defined for X6 as described above. Wherein R5 xi represents the phosphodiesterase inhibitors,PDE I and PDE II, synthesized by N. Xomoto, Y. Enomoto, M. Hiyagaki, I. Tanaka, K. Nitanai and H. Umezawa Agric. Biol. Chem., 43, 555 557 and 550561 1979 . The remaining structures in this category are intermediates in an alternate synthesis of PDE I and II. The thiomethyl compound is prepared by the Gassman reaction P. G. Gassman,G. Gruetzmacher and T. J. Van Bergen, J. Amer. Chem. Soc., 96, 55125517 1974 between the ester or the anilinoindole 2 carboxylate described ror R5 x and the chlorosulfonium salt of a thiomethyl acetaldehyde as its acetal , with cyclization to the indole occurring after deacetalization.Raney nickel removes the thiomethyl group to yield the indole shown. Selective reduction by borane in acidic media B. E. Maryanoff and D. F. Mccomsey, J. Org. Chem., 43, 27332735 1978 provides an alternate route to PDE I and PDE II. For R5 xii, the process used for ix is repeated on the more highly oxygenated indole derivatives listed in x, i.e., condensation of the acyl protected aniline with another indole 2 carboxylic acid derivative. The N methyl compounds are made by reaction of the amides with CH3I and K2C03 in DMF. The phenolic groups are sterically hindered and not readily alkylated. The acid used to prepare R5 xiii has been synthesized by L. Grehn and U. Ragnarsson J. Org. Chem., 46, 31192 31197 1981 . For R5 xiv, the corresponding acids were prepared by T. T. Sakai, J. M. Rio, T. E. Booth and J. D. G ickson EJ. Med. Chem., 24, 279 285 1981 3.For R5 xv, an excess of the appropriate commercially available ethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, ethylene amine, or polyethylene amine is reacted with succinic anhydride or maleic anhydride to give the mono adduct carboxylic acids which can be used as the HCl or quaternary ammonium CH3I salt when X N. Dimers of 3 and ultimately of 6 can be formed where R5 I v, from commercially available dicarboxylic alkanes, or where R5 xvi, preparing the requisite acids by reaction of the appropriate ethylene glycol or amine, or di, tri, or tetramer thereof, with excess succinic or maleic anhydride to afford the bis adduct dicarboxylic acid. The acids used to prepare compounds where R5 is xvii are known in the art or are obtained from the esters which are known in the art or can be prepared by generally known procedures. For example, the following acids and esters are known 1H benzimidazole 2 carboxylic acid H. C. Ooi, H. Suschitzky, J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1, 2871 1982 2 benzoxazolecarboxylic acid H. Moeller, Justic LiebigsAnn. Chem., 7119, 1 1971 2 benzothiazolecarboxylic acid, ethyl ester A. McKillop et al., Tetrahedron Letters 23, 3357 1982 and free acid C. A. Reg.

For xviii the acid lH lndene 2 carboxyllc acid is known in the art J. Vebrel and R. Carrie, Bull. Soc. Chim. Fr. 116 1982 and corresponding substituted acids are obtained by procedures known in the art. When R5 is xix the compounds are prepared using acids which are commercially available, e.g., 2 pyridinecarboxylic acid and piperazinecarboxylic acid or are otherwise known, e.g., 5 hydroxy h pyridinecarboxylicacid C. A. Reg. No. 15069 92 8 , 5 amino 2 pyridine carboxylic acid C. A. Reg.No. 24242 20 4 and 5 mercapto 2 pyridinecarboxylic acid C. A. Reg. No. 24242 22 6 . For R5 xx, 2 naphthalene carboxyli c acid is commercially available, 6 hydroxy 2 naphthaleneoar boxylic acid C. A. Reg. No. 16712 64 4 and 6 amino 2 naphthalinecarboxylic acid, methyl ester C. A. Reg. No. 5159 59 1 are known in the art and other suitable acids are prepared by general procedures known in the art. For R5 xxi, quinaldic acid and 2 quinoxalinecarbonyl chloride are commercially available, 6 aminoquinaldic acid, methyl ester C. A. Reg. No. 16606 1G 104 is known in the art and other suitably substituted acids are prepared by procedures generally known in the art. For R5 xxii, the appropriate acids can be prepare as generally described by L. Grehn and U. Ragnarssson, J. Org.Chem. 46, 3492 3497 1981 .Step 3 The suifonylation chemistry described herein is the case ofX SO2CH3. The mesylate or,. for example, tosylate can be prepared under conditions known in the art employing pyridine with or uithout a catalyst such as dimethylaminopyridine , or other acid acceptors such as trialkylamines with solvent and the corresponding sulfonyl chloride. The halogen analogs of 4 could be prepared under standard procedures knoun in the art such as Ph3P CCl4, or CBr4 or Cii . Step 4 The O deprotection step is described in detail for R1 CH2Ph in the following experiment. When R5 I acyl, however, it is usually more convenient to employ benzyl deprotection with in situ generated trimethylsilyl iodide in refluxing acetonitrile G. A. Olah, S. C. Narang,B. G. B. Gupta and R. Malhotra, J. Org. Chem., 44, 12117 1979 than the conventional hydrogenation over palladium procedure known in the art. Analogs insoluble in acetonitrile may be reacted in mixed aceto nitrile benwnitrile at 600 800C. O Deprotection of other R1 groups can be done by a number or procedures described in the art involving methyl ether cleavage, only alkyl mercaptide in hexamethylphosphorictriamide HMPA under an inert atmosphere 95 110 C. have been found to be effective S. C. Welch and A. S. C. P. Rao, Tet. Letters, 505 1977 and T. R. Kelly. H. M. Dali and W G. Tsang, Tet. Letters, 3859 1977 , orMe2SBBr3indichloroethane p. G. Willard and C. B. Fryhle, Tet. Letters, 3731 1980 .Step 5 For R5 acyl this cyclization step is readily reversed during standard workup or chromatography on silica gel. Consequently the intermediate 5, when R5 acyl, are readily isolable under mildly acidic conditions. Isolation of the cyclopropa products 6 is done in the presence of excess anhydrous bases, such as triethylamine. In contrast, the R5 I sulfonyl analogs 6 are relatively more stable to acidic conditions.Step 6 Treatment of the cyclopropa product 6, when R5 acyl, with dilute aqueous base 0.1N NaOH or CH3NH2 readily saponifies the imide linkage to give the N deprotected vinylogous amide 7 within FormulaI as its conjugate anion. The novelty of this particular step is that the cyclopropyl ring or 7 is relatively stable under these conditions, unllke that or spiro 2,5 octa 1,4 diene 3 one H. Baird and S. Winstein,J. Amer. Chem. Soc., 85, 567 1963 . Step 7 see Chart III The alcohol runction or the starting material can be condensed, under conditions standard in the art, with the optically active, amino protected amino acid, N t butoxy carbonylL tryptophan commercially available , using a condensing agent such as ethyldimethylami nopropyl carbodiimi de or dicyclohexvl carbodiimide, with a catalytic amount of 4 dimethylaminopyridine in methylene chloride or other appropriate solvent. This affords a mixture of the shown ester diastereomers Chart III , from which one diastereomer can be crystallized and separated from the other diastereomer using common organic solvents such as tetrahydrofuran and hexane.Step 8 Hydrolysis of the purified separated diastereomer Of the tryptophane ester to the optically active alcohol 1 is achieved by conditions standard in the art aqueous sodium hydroxide, methanol and tetrahydrofuran, ambient temperature, one hour . The optically active alcohol 1 may then be carried through the above described steps 1 5 to afford optically active analogs in exactly the manner described above for the racemic compounds.

All the compounds of the subject invention have W absorption in the range or 250 nm to 380 nm.Thus, novel compounds or the subject invention are useful as W absorbents in technical and industrial areas, as follows a textile materials, for example, wool, silk, cotton, hemp, flax, linen and the like and b natural or synthetic resins. Depending on the nature of the material to be treated, the requirements with regard to the degree of activity and durability, and other factors, the proportion of the light screening agent to be incorporated into the material may vary within fairly wide limits, for example, from about O.Q1S to about 10 , and, advantageously, 0.1S tc 2S of the weight of the material which is to be directly protected against the action of UV rays. Further, compounds 5 U 66,665 and 6 U 66,694 have activity against the following microorganisms Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumonia, Sarcina lutea, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella schottmeulerri,Mycobacterium avium, Saccharcxnyces pastorianus, and Penicillium oxalicum.Compounds 5 are those obtained from Step 4 in Charts I and II, illustratively U 66,665. Canpounds 6 are those obtained from Step 5 inCharts I and II, illustratively U 66,694. Thus, these compounds are useful to control the proliferation of these microbes in various environments using standard microbiological techniques. Such environments include laboratory benches in a microbiological laboratory which can be cleansed with a formulation of the above compounds dental utensils conraminated with 8. aur and the like. In a manner analgous to that of Examples 2 13 the following carbonxylic acids may be coupled to the pyrroloindole product formed in Example 1.
