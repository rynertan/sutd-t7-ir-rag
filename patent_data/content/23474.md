## Description
Vehicle window raising and lowering mechanism The invention refers to devices for operating windows on motor vehicles and similar. At the present moment, devices are known in which, through the action of a crank which operates a system of gear wheels, a movement is transmitted to 8 drum connected to a hoist, which raises and lowers the hoist or winch according to the movement imparted to the main hoist. ouch an arrangement is perfectly described in the British patent no.733,941, in the name of WILMOT. Devices are also known in which the operation of the crank moves a drum on which a metal cable is wound.A branch of said cable , substantially corneaponding to the traveling run of the window,is suitably led along a path which in a certain way follows the path of the window. Precisely in this branch of the cable an element or support is fixed which displaces itself together with the said cable and to which, on the o ther hand, the window is connected. Among these devices operated by cables, some of them did guide the cable not only for the run or stroke of the window, but slso for the whole path of the same, which was arranged in sn open circuit or loop.A device of this type is manufactured under the trade name of GOLDS Other devices, operated by cable, were realized according to a closed circuit and were connected to different rolls which were arranged within the door of the vehicle. More recently , the German application G.72.41.280.7 in the name of KEESTER has been known, relating to another device this also is realized by means of a metal cable in a closed loop, wherein the cable ran within hoses or jackets connected to the operating system and to the guide of the window. Finally, another window operating system is known, similar in a certain way to the GOLDE system, in which, in the place Of a metal cable, a perforsted belt or band in open loop was utilized, which ran within a guide in one direction or in the opposite direction, according to the fact that the window was open or closed. The devices of the mentioned WILMOT type presented the drawbacks of arms having a remarkable weighs and being exceedingly long, besides other drawbacks which render them unpractical today , given the present trend to reduce the weight of the motor vehicles owing to the direct relation of the weight with gasoli ne consumption. The devices which utilized a metal cable present in general problems of excessive weight, of loosening of the metal cable periodically, and of being rather noisy, besides their uneasy assembling within the doors of the vehicles, in which they occupied too much a room. Among these, the devices of the GOIDE type, in which the cable in open loop was guided by s guide along its whole way, raised furthermore some dra wbscks deriving from the introduction of dirt into the guide within a certain time, so causing difficulties to the normal operation. On the other hand, the devices which employed a metal cable in the form of a closed ring or loop, by themselves, must be suitably passed along each roll which is arranged on the door of the vehicle. The devices of the type claimed by the German application G,72,41.280.7, in the name of KUESTER, although they solved in part some of the abovementioned problems, presented as well the disadvantage of the loosening of the metal cable and presupposed a consumption in the room to be occupied within the door of the vehicle, owing to the rigidity of the hoses within which the cable ran. squally, and precisely owing to the necessary rigidity of said hoses, adjusting problems presented themselves, it being necessary to provide specific devices for each type of door, with the drawbacks which consequently show in a series production. Besides all this, the noise level was unacceptable. Finally, the open loop devices, which utilized a perforated band, presented, as the GOLDE devices, problems of dirt accumulation in the guiding device of the bandland did not fulfil the requirements of 8 quick assembling, since they must be adapted and adjusted for each type of door, besides the fact of occupying a remarkable amount of room inside the door. The device which are the object of the invention improve remarkably all the characteristics of the previously mentioned systems, on the basis of the following general advantages, i.e they represent a device of the closed loop type they are completely noiseless they utilize 8 perforated band of the plastic type for the transmission, which doessnt requi re a previous tightening nor requires any tigh. ening during the operation they are perfectly opted for every type or sha pe of vehicle door they occupy 8 minimum of space inside the door their weight is very reduced it is possible to eliminate the guiding member which follows the run of the windows of the con ventional devices the operating capacity is very remarkable, sin ce,duriVg the tests which have been effected, a number of cycles exceeding 50,000 has been per formed without observing any anomaly machine shop rejection is considersbly reduced, so favouring the automstion of the manufactur ing process of the device the faultless adaptation and fitting of an el ectric motor for its operation is allowed, and this motor can be arranged at the desired loc ation in the door the accumulation spring, and more concretely its positioning, permit to achieve s more quick response of the same when raising the window, besides the fact that no space limitation exi sts and any desired external diameter can be ad opted, with the consequence that lesser turns are required an auxiliary ensemble is achieved for connect ing to the window raising device when the oper ation is by hand, with the aim to eliminate the subjection springs of the system, transferring the locking to the appropriate band in the case of operation through a geared motor, a safety system for the window raising mechanism is achieved, so that the device may be operated by hand. Basically, the device in object starts at the general driving system, beginning with a crank, which is hand operated or motor operated, said crank, through a center pinion gear mounted on its rotation axle, connecting with a planetary system , such as it is shown on the British patent no. 733, 941, the planetary gears in turn engaging within a drum. It is obvious that, as the crank is rotated, the pinion gear of the crank makes the planetary gears to turn, and these, in turn, impart a movement to the drum, whose outside surface, in our case, is furrowed by teeth. It is obvious that this known mechanism may be varied or substituted by any other mechanism , for instance the pinion of the crank directly above the inside of the drum... and so on, the single distinc tive feature, in our case, being that the outside surface of the drum is furrowed by a series of teeth, and that the planetary gears are, preferably made of a plastic material. The operating ensemble is mounted upon a connecting base at the door of the vehicle, and the whole is covered by a cap or cover in the way of a basin which presents side windows, one for each side, through which the ends of the perforated band reach outside, the band being mounted in the teeth of the drum. The terminal portions or ends of the perforated band the band having the suitable length, are related to each other in one of the faces of the supporting member, the o ther face of which is directly fixed to the window. To this end,this supporting member possesses projecting portions which are perpendicular to its surface, and from one of these projecting portions pins depart which sreparallel to said surface, in said pins being placed the ends of the band, the introduction of the pins within the perforations of said ends taking place once the ends have been superposed each other in the way of a collar. Successively, and above both terminal ends, a perforated piece or member is placed, which covers said ends and which receives also the end portions of the pins, effecting the locking. The surface of the piece rests upon the side of the window, is smooth and is provided with suitable voids or holes for its fixing to the vehicle window, in such a way that, once the window and the support have been fixed, the traction of the perforated band wIll cause the raising or the lowering of the window. We prove, therefore, that a driving or operating system is provided which produces the rotation of an externally toothed drum, which, being related with the perforated band and this with the support, will allow to vary the position of said support according to the direction of rotation which is imparted to the rum through the crank. To the end of achieving the guiding of the support and of the window backed by the support, two small guides are arranged upon which the perforated band will slide. These guides for the band or belt may be well positioned upon the same door of the vehicle directly, by which the band and the support will slide freely between said guides, or as well upon the ends of a guide of the support upon which said support slides, in which case it is the guide which is fixed to the inside of the vehicle door. Prefersbly, the perforated band presents a rectangular cross section and is furrowed by holes along its whole length, holes which will coincide, in their general shape, with the teeth of the drum of the driving set, it being precisely due to its main faces that the sliding of the same band takes place, upon the abovementioned guides. To this end, the guides will present a smooth surface having a height sufficient so that the whole height of the band may contact with it to the end of achieving the correct operation of the arrangement, and they are terminated by some projecting,upper and lower, portions which will prevent the fortuitous possibility of the exit of the band from said guides, when the device is being utilized. These, in their turn, present holes on their base, to the end of being either connected with the door of the vehicle through conventional screws or to the terminal ends of a central guide of the window support, when the device possesses said central guide. In this last case, the proper guide central guide will be arranged directly above the door. In the one case or the other, the perforated band is fixed,by its terminal ends,to the projecting portions of the supporting piece of the window. When the utilization of the central guide is not needed, the supporting piece is freely dragged by the toothed drum of the driving arrangement and will occupy the proximity of the one or the other of the side sliding guides, in the positions of open or locked window.The side sliding guides of the perforated band will arrange themselves in an aligned position in correspondence with the direction in which the window must be displaced, exactly at the point of the support which causes its displacement, so that the lower and upper guides will occupy points of the vehicle door which correspond to the end positions of the path of the mentioned supporting member. In the case that the window has not a flat shape but is curved as it is the case for a great number of modern vehicles, the support of the window when being dragged will execute perfectly a curved path, since said path will be guided by the proper guides of the door frame. In those cases in which the user of the window doesn t offer safety as to the correct guiding of said window, for not keeping the two guides in their path, one will provide to put into relation the small terminal guides for the sliding with a central guide, which will be straight or curved, according to the cases, by means of said central guide sliding the support on which the window rests, it being then reali zed the mounting of the guides sliding upon the terminal ends of the central guide, while the latter will be mounted upon the vehicle door. It is to be understood that in the one as the o ther case, two anchoring points of the device above the door are needed, apart, it is clear, from the set anchoring of the driving group, but with the particularity that, since the connection between all the points is achieved by the flexible member represented by the perforated band, any mounting tolerance can be sbsorbed, whichever its type may be. Furthermore, and owing to said flexibility and to the fact that the ends of the band may be arranged above the support very easily and may be extracted from the support equally easily, the possibility exists to adapt the device to any size of vehicle door, specially when the device doesn t comprises the guide of the window support. The mounting of the device is extremely quick and simple, since it will suffice to place the sliding guides of the band in the indicated places, to introduce the band with the window support already included on said sliding guides, enclosing the same, and to fix the driving unit without the need of effecting a stretching action,previously, upon the band, the band stretching it self in an automatic way during the operation, said stretching being independent from said operation, precisely owing to the sliding which the band undergoes upon the sliding guides. On the other hand, the auxiliary item stands out which refers to the windowsaising devices in which the operation is by hand, with the purpose of eliminating pieces of the operating system of the ensemble, while simultaneously transferring the braking of said operation to the window support, the mentioned braking being effected by the own weight of the window. According to another arrangement, the sliding guides of the perforated band are mounted with some spring backing upon the same, said springs imparting to said guides a trend to effect a pressing action upon the perforated band , while in the same time they serve as guides for the band, the whole with the purpose to absorb the possible band deformations in the sense of elongation, if any, due to temperature effects, and so on. In order to achieve the braking of the system when the same is operated by hand, one will proceed to connect the terminal ends of the perforated band with two different pieces, eliminating from the op erating system the check spring related to each posit ion of the window , transferring the proper braking or checking function to the two pieces which are connected to the terminal ends of the perforated band. To this end, one of these pieces supports the window and in its turn slides upon the sliding guide related to the path of said window, while the other piece travels inside said guide. The perforated band is connected to the support ting piece of the window, which presents a wedged in portion, ending at its larger region by two projecting portions, with a general T shape. This portion stands out of the surface of the supporting piece by the face which is opposite to the fixing fsce of the window, precisely on the guide side. On the other hand, the other piece related to the other terminal end of the perforated band, presents a general U shape, its central void portion being similar to that of the wedged in portion of the support of the other terminal end. Equally, it possesses some re entering portions or recesses within which the projecting portions of the other supporting piece will house. Both pieces present the means which are suitable for the fixing of the terminal ends to each of them, being the thicknesses of both pieces similar in order to facilitate their adjustment through the em brscing of one upon the other. When one of the termi nal ends of the band is drawn, the traction is produced upon the corresponding supporting piece, which in turn drags the other piece, owing to the interconnection of the two pieces.When the movement of the raising device of the windows stops, the support holding the window and which is the member presenting the wedged in portion, receives the weight of the window and penetrates into the central void of the other piece, opening it and effecting a pressure upon the guide, immobilizing the ensemble in an autom atic way, until one begins again to operate the driving device, in which moment the locking is abolished. The supporting piece holding the window presents itself some regions which arrange themselves on the external side of the guide, for its faultless guiding, this guide presenting an U shaped section with the ends of its wings doubled parallelly to the base.Upon the inside surfaces of said wings of the guide, pqrallelly and little spaced, run the side surfaces of the supporting piece connected to the other terminal end, so that when the projection wedged in of the other support will open its side portions, these will approach and will contact the mentioned surfaces of the guide, so effecting the braking action. This notwithstanding, when the perforated band is operated,through the mechanism, in the one or the other direction, the immediately produced anchoring is undone, since the wedged in regions, male and female, of each support lose their contact. According to another arrangement, the small sliding guides, hold each a spiral spring housed within the fitting axles of said elements to the central guide, the ends of said springs, duly connected, allowing to achieve a stretching action on said pieces sliding upon the perforated band, that is a continuous contact of the sliding guides against the band. When the window raising device is operated by an automatic motor unit, that is,is operated through the action of a geared motor which causes the rotation of the main ensemble, it happens that, when the electric geared motor breaks down, itis impossible to raise or lower the window due to the fact that the user of the vehicle is unable to unblock the mechanical block. This has the consequence that the window remains in the position that it occupied when the failure occurred, until 8 repair or an overhaul is effected , for instance at a specialized body shop. In this relation a mechanism is put into action which allows an easy intervention by the part of the vehicle user upon the device, and, consequently, the raising or the lowering of the window at will, not withstanding the blocking position. The schievement of this mechanism requires less effort towards a normal operation and, therefore, renders more smooth the reduction of the varioua components. The mechanism in object starts from a central pinion operated by the output axle of the geared motor set, upon the pinion some planetary gears being located, for instance three of them, upon these plan etary gears a fixed crown gear being situated, which is toothed externally and internally. When the center pinion rotates, the planetary gears revolve about themselves and sbout a circular path within the fixed external crown gear. At the theoretical position of the axles of the planetary gears, holes are arranged within which some projecting portions of a gear wheel will house, the latter wheel being placed in a plane which is parallel to the path of the planetary gears. In this way the gear wheel rotates, driven by said planetary ry gears, and it receives externally a perforated belt or band, which is charged with the task of effecting the movement of the window raising device, through the intervention of any other mechanism. All the abovementioned pieces are located inside a suitable casing, in which the corresponding openings are made for the output axle of the geared motor and for the inlet and the outlet of the perforated band. Under these conditions, when the geared motor is in operation, the center pinion of the ensemble will rotate, and, in its turn, causes the rotation of the idle planetary gears which occupy the circular space between said pinion and the fixed external crown wheel, which, ss it has been previously mentioned, is provided internally and externally with teeth.The internal toothing serves, obviously, to effect the circulation of the planetary gears, and the external toothing is that which is utilized in order to actuate the proper safety device. Such device is constituted by a small stem or axle which is parallel to the output axle of the gesred motor, and consequently to the center pinion, planetary gears, and so on this stem or axle combines together the following features Its most external portion keeps near to the internal body of the door, the access to this portion being gained through an orifice which has been made on said body this Dri fice is masked by a piece,having in plan a circular shape, which occupies said void and presents oonnec ting means with the same, this piece being easy to place or remove according to the need. The stem portion to which we have referred presents a characteristic shape, such that it may receive a key or similar arJwhich will allow its rotation. The terminal end which is opposite to that portion, keeps included within the internal part of the block which receives the rest of the elements and is embraced by 8 wheelwork which facilitates its rotation. In the proximity of this wheelwork, the stem possesses a projecting or raising portion which is circular and is provided with teeth which engage the fixed crown wheel which houses the planetary gears by its external portion. Under normal working conditions, the center pinion rotates and causes the rotation of the planetary gears between itself and the external crown,which is fixed. It logically promotes the rotation of the cro Will, connected, through the stems, to the planetary gears,. and the movement of the remaining part of the window raising device when the geared motor meets a failure, the center pinion keeps iramobilized ss a consequence of the general blocking action, and then the window will stay at an unchangesble position, since the crown wheel which embraces the planetary gears is fixed, too. uhis notwithstanding, if we cause the stem to revolve, its toothed portion will oblige the until now fixed crown to rotate, with which the planetary gears will turn and the external crown will cause the perforated band to move. For this, a key may be utilized, once the cover concealing the external access to this stem has been removed. As we have indicated, the regions of the stem which support the toothed and resting portions in a wheelwork are included within the external body or casing which collects all the remaining pieces. This casing includes a conventional pawl which is connected to the toothed portion, so that once the window has been raised, the position of the latter keeps fixed without any possibility that said window may revert to its initial position. All these details, and various further details, are perfectly described in the enclosed drawings and plsns in which the following is represented Figure 1 shows a plan view of the device Figure 2 shows the same device, with the center guide for the window Figure 3 is an enlarged plan view, in which botch possibilities are realized Figure 4 corresponds to a front view related to the previous representstion Figure 5 is front view of the main driving set or unit which includes the center pinion and the planetary gears Figure 6 corresponds to a plan view of the external drum, put into motion with the forward drive Figure 7 is a side view corresponding to Figure 6 representation Figure 8 corresponds to the center guide for the window Figure 9 refers to an upper view corresponding to Figure 8 representation Figure 10 shows the plan view of each of the side guiding members Figure 11 is a lower view corresponding to Figure 10 representation Figure 12 is a part view of the section AA which is indicated in Figure 10 Figure 13 shows the connecting cover of the ter minal ends of the band above the supporting piece of the window Figure 14 is a front view of said supporting piece Figure 15 is a plan view corresponding to Figure 14 representation Figure 16 shows the accumulating spring Figure 17 is a side view of the same spring Figure 18 is a possible variant or modification of the accumulating spring arrangement Figure 19 represents one of the supporting pieces, together with the window and the guide, in the case that the locking is effected at the guide Figure 20 shows a perspective view of the other supporting piece Figure 21 reflects in a schematic way the relation between the two beforementioned pieces Figure 22 is a transversal cross section of the ensemble of pieces which are mentioned in the three previous Figures Figure 23 corresponds to the arrangement of a spring within the sliding guides Figure 24 is a section front view of the ensemble of mechanisms, when they embody the manually op erased releasing i.e. un blocking system Figure 25 corresponds to a schematic side view of the ensemble of mechanisms represented in Figure 24 figure 26 is a plan view of the external crown wheel operating, in this case, the perforated band or belt Figure 27 is a front view of the abovementioned crown wheel. Jith reference , now, to these Figures, we will say that the driving or operating device comprises basically a motor unit, a perforated band or belt 4 , some small guides 9 and a support 13 to which the terminal ends of the band 14 are connected and the window. The motor set or unit 1 comprises an axle 16 which receives the movement from a crank or motor, not represented, said axle being in relation with the inside of a center pinion 18 which engages a system of planetary gears 19 , preferably three in number, which are of a plastic material or similar, these planetary gears being in turn housed inside the drum 20 . The drum 20 is internally furrowed by teeth 22 , and externally the projecting portions 21 raise which totally occupy its side surface, as it appears from Figures 5, 6 and 7.The ensemble is collected by the cover 1 , which is substantially located towards the inside of the vehicle door, and which presents sollle small side windows for the outlets of a perforated band 4 with voids 15 in which the teeth 21 of the drum introduce themselves. The free ends of the perforated band 4 , which has preferably a rectangular cross section , are rel eted to each other in the way of a collar, upon some projecti pins 31 of one of the faces of the supporting piece 13 , the locking of this collar being achieved, by means of the cover 27, Fig.13 which, provided with holes 28 , receives the most exter nql portions of the abovementioned pins 31 , effecting the interconnection pf the terminal ends of the band 4 upon the support 13 . This support 13 presents, in its turn, means 14 in order to achieve the fixing to the window of the vehicle. The device, therefore, comprises the motor set, the perforated band and the support for the window, with this support being into relation the terminal ends of said band. In order to effect the mounting of this ensemble of elements upon the vehicle door, one proceeds to plece the guides 9 Fig. 10 and 11 on whose side portions 96 said band slides. Each guide 9 presents 8 curved shape with two outlets 11 , one of which is on the side of the motor set, while the other 12 is on the aide of the supporting piece 13 , and sn upper projection 24 , as well as a lower rim 25 section AA , Fig. 10 , which permits an easy access of the band and which, this notwithstanding, prevents the possible exit of the the same band from its contact with the surface 26 during the operation. When the cornice of the window of the vehicle presents some guides which are suitable for the window, the guides 9 will be fixed to the door through the orifices 10 of the base of the same, this fixing being effected taking into account that both guides must be related to each other according to an alignment corresponding with that of the window, both if the window is straight or curved, under this condition the support running on the path, whichever it be, without any difficulty Fig. 1 . This notwithstanding, when the cornice of the door has a special configuration, which implies that continuous guides for the window don t present themselves, one proceeds to fix the guides 9 upon the terminal ends of a central guide Fig.2 , which will adspt It self to the straight or curved path of the window, in consequence of which said guide will take a straight or curved shape, obviously. In this case, the guide 5 will adopt an U shaped crosssection, preferably, on whose wings the base will slide of the supporting piece 13 , provided with projections 34 29 and 32 in which will be restrained the section of the guide 5 , which, on the other side will be fixed to the door structure by means of the plungers 17, Fig.4 . On the other hand, and owing to the arrangement of the accumulating spring which helps in the raising of the window when it is in the lowered position, an accumulating spring 37, Fig. 16 is placed which is compressed and receives 8 pressure when the window is raised, and is released and yields pressure when said window is raised, providing a force upwards which favours the raising.The sccumulBtion springs sre known for themselves in relation to this and to other applications, but the adventage stands out, due to its localization, of being able to introduce a spring s external diameter of any desired am ount, preferably a high diameter, by which not only the room for the spring is limited but also a more quick response of the spring itself and a lesser number of turns is required in order to achieve the desired potential pressure. In effects, and as it appears from the Fig. 17, the spring 37 is mounted upon a pin of an auxiliary piece 40 which is moved by some projections 41 of the planetary gear axles l9 . The projections 41 drag, for instance by a friction clutching action, the piece 40 and the latter is impartinga pressure to the spring 37 , one end of which is connected to the pin 42 of the piece 40 , while the other end of the spring is connected to a projection 38 existing inside the cover 1 .If one desires to increase the outside diameter of the spring 37 , one could proceed according to the description seen inFig. 18, in which the ends 41 act upon the inside of a piece 43 enclosed by a cover l having a larger diameter, which allows logically to increase at will the size of the spring without any limit. In order to effect the placement within the vehicle door, one proceeds previously to consider the proper guiding of the window in the cornice, with the purpose of knowing if this guiding arrangement will suffice to allow the sliding of the window itself, and proceeds to locate the driving unit motor at the exact place in which the door crank is to stsy which yellows to raise or lower the window. If the guides of the door cornice are sufficient, the guide des 9 are fixed at the alignment which corresponds and the end terminals of the band are connected in the supporting piece 13 , once said band has been introduced into the space between the projection 24 and the projection 25 of said guides.A very precise adjustment of the starting tension of the band in this operation is not needed but a manual ad justment will suffice, although the device doesn t require such tension for its normal operation. In effects, and making reference to Fig. 1, we must point out that, according to the direction of rotation of the motor unit, the ends A or B of the band 4 will undergo a self stretching action, although, among other causes, a sliding exists upon the guides 9 . The end which is opposed to the stretched end will run freely, with the single proviso which may observed in Fig. 12, of placing the lower projection 25 which will prevent any risk that the band may exit.This notwithstanding, this projection will not hinder in any way in relation to the previous manual introduction of the bandv en the guides of the window cornice don t offer a directional reliability for the window, the guides 9 will be mounted upon the terminal ends 23 of a central guide, straight or curved sccording to the window, on which the window support 13 will slide, through 34 29 and 32 .In its turn, this guide 5 is secured upon the door, through some catches 17 which are integrsl with the same, In both cases, the sbility of the ensemble to adjust to any tolerance is very wide since, being the band flexible, the anchoring points of the motor set and of the guides 9 or catches 17 , according to the cases, allow to alter their positions, thus absorbing any type of tolersnce of the dimensions of the door. This sbility or capacity is furthermore increased since, when the manual mounting is effected of the band on the guides 9 and the support 13 , its length can be varied in the desired amount, approaching the desired anchoring points.This has the consequence that when the operation is effected electrically, by 8 motor or similar, this may occupy in the door the desired place, independently from the features of the device in itself. Another advantageous festure of the device is the realization of the recesses 35 and 36 of the supporting piece 13 , which, as it can be seen from theFigure 3, receive the terminal ends 12 of the guides 9 , with the maximum utilization of the inter val or distance between the same, which redounds to the possibility of an easier access and into a smaller space, to the limit positions of opening and or closing of the window. It is pointed out again the adaptation ability of the device to every possible space available inside a door, with a total independence of the device itself, both owing to the true mobility conferred by the band and the possibility of shortening or clipping said band when this is desired. Besides this, the device doesn t require any precision in its manufacturing, it being possible to employ materials having lesser cost than the conventional ones furthermore, the device requires 8 band section which is smaller than that required by the conventional devices. On another subject, we want to point out, with reference to the Figures 24, 25, 26 and 27, that by 45 ,the supporting piece of the window 50 is indicated, which in its turn is provided with some wings 46 which embrsce the side portions of the guide 47 . In this piece 45 , from whose base the projection 48 comes out, sn end terminal of perforated band is embodied which is housed within the lon gitudinal central groove in 8 direction which is perpendicular to the surface 45 , through the co operation of a latch. In the projection 48 one can verify the existence of the side wedged in regions 49 , aS well as of the two projections 55 which end said regions 49 . The other piece 51 presents a central voidJcoin cident with the shape of 49 lond is placed upon the piece 45, Fig 21 . This piece 51 receives by it self the other terminal end of the perforated band 56 , which, equally as the piece 45 , keeps housed within the longitudinal central groove of the piece 45 ana in relation with the piece 51 through 8 catch which is pressurerhoused within 52 . The side surfaces 55 of 51 keep arranged st 8 small di stance lrom the internal walls 57 of the guides it can be seen from figure 22. When the terminal end of the band 56 which is connected to the piece 45 is drawn according to the M direction, the projectIons 55 of the portion 48 will contact at the upper walls of the voids of the piece 51 , effecting the dragging of the latter and of its band end. In this moment the window 5O , con nected with the piece 45 , is raised. If, on the contrary, we will act according to the P direction upon the terminal end of the piece which is connected with 51 , said piece 51 is drawn, and in identical conditions the projections , which 8 re housed within the recesses of the piece 5 will contact and drag the piece 455, with which operat ion the window is lowered. When there is no direct action upon the perforated band, in the one or the other direction, only the weight N of the proper window affirms it self, and the contact is removed between tho upper ends of the projections 55 and the upper surfaces of the recesses of 51 , then falling the piece 45 whose lower walla of 55 will not contact the lower surfaces of 51 , by which reason the wedged in surfaces 49 will cut into the corresponding surfaces of the piece 51 , opening this piece, so that its surfaces 53 keep pressed against the in ternal surfaces 57 of the guide 47 , so immobi lizing the ensemble and fixing the window at the de sired position. In order to remove this braking action, it will suffice to proceed to realize, i.e. effect, the dragging of 45 or 51 , according to the M or P dir ections, since,in the one or the other cesse, the cutting in action of the wedged in regions will be cleared, in the first case for the raising of the piece 45 , and in the second case for the low ering of the piece 51 Figure 21 . In any case, the response, in raising, lowering or braking, is automatic and is effected upon the proper guide 47 . From their part, the sliding pieces 58 for the band, are provided with a single fixing axle 59 upon the guide 47 or upon the vehicle door, in this axle being established the rotation center of a spring, whose one terminal end 60 connects to a fixed point 62 , while the other 61 connects to one end, at the exit of the band, of the piece 58 , by which the action of the spring according to R will act in any moment upon the band, imparting to it the needed tension. This continued action co operates in order toasse the maintoinment of said tension, and in any case would absorb any elongation, which the band would possibly undergo. The detail relsting to the safety operation is represented in the Figures 24, 25, 26 and. 27, in whichthe inside of the vehicle door 65 can be seen,. with an axle outlet 64 , outlet which obviously will not ex ist in the case in which the operation would take place automatically through a geared motor. In any case, the gxle in object, both in the cases of automatic and manual driving, empresses a rotation movement to the central pinion 67 which, in its turn, transmits the movement also to the planetary gears 68 , 69 and 70 , which ore engaged to the fixed crown 71 .This crown wheel, obviously, will be toothed exter nslly and internally, and, we repeat it, is fixed.The planetary gears 68 , 69 and 70 run idle, and their axles are holed in order to be able to receive the pins 78 of the external crown 76 , which is occupied externally by the teeth 77 which will drive a perforated belt or band, not represented. The axle stem 73 , parallel to the central axle of the abovementioned mechanism, presents a frontal portion 74 , which has a suitable shape in order to allow its driving through the action of a key, for instance, this frontal portion 74 being accessible from outside 65 through a hole which exists in the door of the vehicle. The opposed end of the stem 73 , is enclosed inside the same cas ing or body 66 which includes the rest of the var ious elements , and presents 8 wheelwork 79 faces litating its rotation, and a cylindrical crown gear 72 engaging with the exterior portion of the crown 71 .This portion 72 is actuated according to S by a single pawl which permits the rotation of the same in one direction, that is the direction of win dow raIsing, and prevents the rotation inthe opposite direction, that is in the window lowering direction. Under normal conditions, the rotation of the pinion 67 promotes that of the planetary gears 68 , 69 and 70 within the cornice of the crown wheel 71 . The pins 78 of the external crown 76 being housed within the planetary gears 68 , 69 and 70 , the crown 76 undergoes the suitable movement of rotation. When the geared motor meets a failure, and consequently the pinion 66 doesn t achieve the movement, the driving. of the window raising device becomes impossible, but it can be put into operation if, by me sns of the region 72 of the stem 73 ,the rotation is effected of the crown 67 which was previously fixed. By extracting the external stopper 75 , it is possible, by the sid of any tool, to gain the access to the portion 74 of the stem, effecting its rotation and gradually raising the window until it will be possible to repair the failure. Here,and with reference to the content of the Figures 24, 25, 26 and 27, the possibility is ascertai ned of achieving really 8 given mounting with an au tomatic as well as a manual driving system, without mdre than connecting a handle to the axle 73 in its position 74 , the handle having access to the outside of the door 65 . The only variation will consist in the substitution of the pawl S by a conventional spring, similar to the member 66 which willImmobilize the window, both in the window raising position and in the window lowering position, by which the mechanism would be prepared for its operation, ma nual or automatic, as desired.
