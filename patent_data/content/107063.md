## Description
STABILIZATION OF POLYMERS USING CITRATE SALTS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Most synthetic polymer materials undergo deterioration when exposed to light or elevated temperatures over a prolonged period of time.. Some polymers are so sensitive to heat that they will degrade objectionably even during the relatively short period of time they are exposed to elevated temperatures during many types of compounding and processing operations. The degradation effects of heat and light on polymers often can be at least temporarily retarded by mixing a heat and light stabilizer normally referred to as primary stabilizer with the polymer.The particular primary stabilizer chosen will depend upon the polymer to be used. Chlorine containing synthetic polymers whether the chlorine atom is introduced as a part of a monomer or is added by the post chlorination of a previously formed polymer are quite susceptible to heat degradation at most normal processing temperatures and, as a consequence, stabilization of the polymer is of significant importance.Typical primary stabilizers used commercially for stabilizing chlorine containing polymers include a wide variety of materials such as the barium, cadmium, zinc, tin and lead salts of monocarboxylic acids and the organotin and organoantimony stabilizers. Generally, from about 0.5 to 5.0 parts by weight of a primary stabilizer is used per 100 parts by weight of the polymer. However, even with the addition of a primary stabilizer, the polymer composition often is not sufficiently heat stabilized to permit the composition to be used in processing techniques that require the composition to be heated to moderately high temperatures for example, product forming by injection molding . Also, the cost of many of the preferred primary stabilizers is relatively high. Accordingly, stabilizer systems which provide better heat stabilization at a reduced cost are sought by the industry. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a stabilization system for vinyl chloride polymers that produces increased thermal stability and a significant cost savings over many of the stabilizer systems currently in use. In accordance with this invention, sodium citrate or potassium citrate is used in conjunction with an organotin or organoantimony primary stabilizer to produce a synergistic stabilization of the polymer composition. Although it has been proposed heretofore to stabilize post chlorinated vinyl chloride resin with alkali metal salts of citric acid, with or without the presence of primary stSSilizers, Japanese KokaiPatent No.Sho 49 1974 37943, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference , in order to obtain the desired synergistic effect it now has been found that the particle size of the sodium or potassium citrate should be below 30 micrometers cm . Although the sodium and potassium citrate salts produce the desired synergistic result, not all citrate salts do. For example, rubidium citrater calcium citrate and strontium citrate failed to produce the desired synergistic results. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides an improved stabilization system for vinyl chloride polymers. The term vinyl chloride polymer , as used herein, includes homopolymers of vinyl chloride polyvinyl chloride polymers , homopolymers of vinylidene chloride polyvinylidene chloride polymers , copolymers of vinyl chloride or vinylidene chloride with up to 30 percent by weight of at least one other copolymerizable monoolefinic or vinyl type comonomer such as vinylidene chloride, vinyl acetate, methyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate, styrene, acrylonitrile, ethylene, propylene, and the like , and post chlorinated homopolymers of vinyl chloride or vinylidene chloride post chlorinated polyvinyl chloride polymers and post chlorinated polyvinyl dene chloride polymers and post chlorinated copolymers of vinyl chloride or vinylidene chloride with up to 30 percent by weight of at least one other copolymerizable monoolefinic or vinyl type comonomer. Preferred vinyl chloride polymers for use in the present invention are post chlorinated vinyl chloride polymers having a density in the range of from about 1.46 to about 1.65 grams cc at 250C. and a chlorine content in the range of from about 60 to about 72 by weight. The stabilization system of the present invention comprises a combination of an organotin or organoantimony primary stabilizer and sodium citrate and or potassium citrate, with the citrate salt having a particle size below 30 urn, preferably a particle size below about 10 urn. Typical primary stabilizers useful in the present invention include the dialkyltin and alkylantimony carboxyl ates and mercaptides, for example, dibutyltin dilaurate, dibutyltin maleate, di n octyltin maleate, dibutyltin bis lauryl mercaptide , dibutyltin S,S bis isooctyl thioglycolate , dibutyltin S mercaptoproprionate, di n octyltin S,Sbis isooctyl thioglycolate, di n octyltin S mercaptoproprio nate, and antimony S,S,S tris isooctyl thioglycolate . The lead salt primary stabilizers and mixtures of barium salts and cadmium salts have not exhibited the desired synergistic stabilization when combined with sodium or potassium citrate salts. The primary stabilizer used in a particular polymer composition will need to be compatible with the other components of the composition, of course.The organotin stabilizers have been used extensively for stabilizing vinyl chloride polymers commercially even though they are considerably more expensive than many other primary stabilizer systems that are available. About 0.5 to 5.0 parts by weight of the primary stabilizer per 100 parts by weight of the vinyl chloride polymer can be used in the composition, although from 0.5 to 3.0 parts by weight of the primary stabilizer per 100 parts by weight of the vinyl chloride polymer is preferred. The citrate salt component of the stabilization system can be present in an amount from 0.01 to 5.0 parts by weight of the citrate salt per 100 parts by weight of the vinyl chloride polymer, preferably from 0.01 to 3.0 parts by weight of the citrate salt per 100 parts by weight of the vinyl chloride polymer. A preferred method of combining the citrate salt with the chlorine containing polymer is to dissolve the citrate salt in water or other volatile solvent for the citrate salt and mix the solution with the polymer.The resulting blend then is dried. Extremely fine particles, as small as 2pm, of the citrate salt are formed in the resulting dried blend. It has been found that very small amounts of the citrate salt for example, 0.01 to 0.05 parts by weight per 10Q parts by weight of the vinyl chloride polymer will produce significant improvement in postchlorinated polymers that contain small amounts of iron. It is believed that the citrate acts as an iron chelator and prevents the adverse effect of the iron contaminant. The composition stabilized in accordance with the present invention also can include compounding ingredients such as reinforcing agents, curatives, fillers, lubricants, etc. that normally are included in vinyl chloride polymer compositions. The following examples illustrate the present invention more fully. The heat stability of the compositions tested was determined by measuring the dynamic thermal stability DTS of the composition using a BrabenderPlastic Corder torque rheometer with a No 5 roller head Model PLV 300 . DTS is the time inteval, expressed in minutes, between the start of mixing and breakdown determined by a sudden increase in torque and change in melt temperature . A 3 minute warm up period of the sample in the Brabender bowl was allowed before testing of the sample.
