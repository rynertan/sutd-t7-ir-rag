# Method of separating molybdenum or tungsten from non volatile contaminants.

## Abstract
Method of separating molybdenum or tungsten from non volatile contaminants. The contaminated molybdenum or tungsten is heated to between 800 and 1100 C and reacted with oxygen to completely oxidize the molybdenum or tung sten. The MoO₃ or WO₂ is volatile having a vapor pressure of the order of one atmosphere at 1100 C while the contaminant metal oxides have a very low vapor pressure, allowing the molybdenum oxide or tungsten oxide gas to be separated from the non volatile contaminants, cooled and condensed.

## Description
METHOD OF SEPARATING MOLYBDENUM OR TUNGSTEN FROM NObJ VOLATILE CONTAMINANTS This method relates to a method of separating molybdenum or tungsten from non volatile contaminants. The basic component of the core of nuclear reactors, both pressurized water reactors and boiling water reactors, is the cylindrical fuel pellet. The pellet is composed of slightly enriched, approximately 2.5 to 4.0 wt. U235, uranium dioxide powder. Before the fabrication of the pellet itself, however, the uranium must be enriched from approximately 0.7 wt U235 to the 2.5 to 4.0 wt. U235. The enrichment process requires the use of uranium hexafluoride gas UF6 . The enriched uranium is received in the form of UF6 at the fuel fabrication facility. TheUF6 must then be converted into uranium dioxide, U02. This is accomplished by the ammonium diuranate ADU process. UF6 2H2 U02F2 NH4OH NH4 2 U207 2 U02 rhe product of this process is a fine oxide powder containing 88.15 wt. uranium. It has a theoretical density of 10.97 grams per cc. and a melting point over 28000C. The uranium is now in the isotopic and chemical state required for use as nuclear fuel in a core. To get the uranium dioxide powder shaped for fabrication into fuel assemblies, it is made into pellets by cold pressing and then sintered at high temperatures to attain the required density. The sintered uranium dioxide is chemically inert at reactor temperatures and pressures. The consequences of any accidental breach of the cladding are minimized by the ability of the uranium dioxide lattice to retain fission products and to resist corrosion caused by high temperature water. The sintering process is carried out by placing the pellets in carrier vessels called boats for transport of the pressed UO2 pellets through sintering furnaces.These boats are often fabricated from molybdenum which is inert to the hydrogen cover gas generally used in such furnaces. At the sintering temperatures used, UO2 is somewhat volatile and condenses on the boats which, after repeated use, acquire a significant surface layer of uranium dioxide contamination. These boats must ultimately be discarded, a loss not only of the valuable molybdenum, but disposal costs must also be paid for handling the contaminated scrap. It is desirable to decontaminate the molybdenum, a commodity of value, as part of the waste handling process. Other processes for removing surface contamination use some form of abrading or removal of the film coating by attempting to dissolve the coating without dissolving the underlying metal. These methods fall short of complete separation important in U02 decontamination and are accomplished by the generation of additional waste, contaminated abrasive particles or contaminated acid solution. According to the the present invention, a method of separating molybdenum or tungsten from non volatile contaminants is characterized by a method of separating molybdenum or tungsten from non volatile contaminants, characterized by heating the contaminated molybdenum or tungsten to a temperature sufficient to vaporize the associated high vapor pressure oxide, passing sufficient oxygen over the heated, contaminated molybdenum or tungsten to stoichiometrically react the latter with oxygen to form the high vapor pressure oxide thereof, passing the gaseous oxide of molybdenum or tungsten through a condenser, causing it to solidify, and recovering the separated oxide of molybdenum or tungsten.The condensed oxide is pure and commercially valuable, exceeding the costs of the process. In order that the invention can be more clearly understood, a preferred embodiment thereof will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawing, which is a schematic diagram of a process for separating molybdenum from non volatile contaminants, including non volatile oxides, While uranium dioxide, U02, normally oxidizes to a non volatile higher oxide, U30s, as do most heavy metal oxides such as Cr203, MnO2, Fe203, Fe304, or NiO, molybdenum oxidizes to the volatile oxide MoO3, which has a high vapor pressure approaching one atmosphere at 11000C. The oxidation of molybdenum proceeds in at least two steps Mo O2 , MoO MoO2 2 4 MoO3In these steps the 2 may be present as pure oxygen, as the oxygen component of air, or as a component of any oxidizing reagent. The higher oxide, MoO3 is quite volatile and sublimates at 7600C so although it melts at about 8000C it can be vaporized rapidly and under suitable conditions the amount of liquid phase can be minimized. Referring to Fig. 1, a mechanical mixture of U02 and Mo can be treated with oxygen gas in a retort furnace 12 at a suitable temperature in the range of 800 11000C.The volatile MoO3 leaves the furnace and is condensed by cooling it in a heat exchanger 14 the condensed solid is accumulated in a receiver 16 outside the furnace and recovered. The non volatile contaminant oxides remain behind and can be swept or vacuumed out of the furnace. In a practical application of the process, molybdenum boats that have been used in sintering U02 cold pressed pellets are separated from condensed vapor U02 on the molybdenum boats. The contaminated material to be processed is in the form of carrier boats having dimensions of about 7 inches by 7 inches by 3 inches with a i inch wall thickness and having a total weight of about 16 pounds, and scrap fragments of these boats. This material is charged into a retort furnace 12 with a capacity of several hundred kilograms. Heating a charge of the indicated size to about 11000C is well within the capabilities of the commonly available furnaces. A stream of oxygen is provided to the charge of contaminated Mo boats during the heat treating and distillation processes.For a charge of 225 kilograms 500 pounds approximately 78,000 liters of oxygen gas at standard temperature pressure STP of oxygen gas is required for stoichiometric transformation of the charge to MoO3, plus a small additional amount for oxidizing the U02 contaminant from U02 to U308. This amount of oxygen can be supplied by any of a number of installations commonly used for industrial applications. The generated MoO3 will move as a vapor into the lower pressure and cooled region of the heat exchanger 14 where it will condense and fall to the receiver 16 as a powder For each 225 kilogram charge 336 kilograms of MO03 will be formed as a loose powder at a packing fraction of 0.5 this constitutes 140 liters of solid. At the same time, assuming the original U02 contaminants are disposed in a uniform layer 0.25 millimeters thick over all the boat surfaces, a volume of nearly 4 liters of U308 would be left behind in the retort furnace 12. The recovered MoO3 has a value of approximately 4.00 per pound, resulting in a single furnace charge of 225 kilograms of scrap producing MoO3 worth about 3,000. Although recovered in much smaller quantities, the U308 containing uranium enriched in the range of 2.5 to 4 wt. U235, has a value of approximately 1,000 per kilogram of uranium. The above described embodiment oxidizes the Mo toMoO3 without forming significant amounts of MoO2 as an intermediate step. This is not the only possible process using this volatility principle. Any of the following may prove upon experimentation more practical or cost effective. Heating the molybdenum scrap in a static atmosphere of oxygen at a temperature that is low enough so that only the lower oxide, Mo02, is formed. The temperature is then increased to further oxidize the material to the higher oxide, MoO3, employing an oxygen stream to carry the volatile material into a condenser as described above. Another method is heating the molybdenum in a static atmosphere of oxygen at a temperature high enough to convert it completely to a liquid MoO3, which will be contained in a refractory ceramic vessel. When conversion is complete the liquid is evaporated in a stream of nitrogen or other inert gas condensing it as described above. A third method is heating the molybdenum in a static atmosphere of oxygen at a temperature that is low enough so only the lower oxide, MoO2, is formed. After the transformation is complete the lower oxide is heated to a higher temperature in a static oxygen environment until it is converted into MoO3. The MoO3 is then evaporated in flowing inert gas and condensed as described above. The above described processes make use of the formation of a volatile oxide formed by reacting the metal molybdenum with oxygen. This property of volatility of the oxide is rare among metals and of the common industrial metals is shared only by molybdenum and tungsten. The above process may therefore be used also in separating tungsten from other contaminant metals and metal oxides, all of which are non volatile. In the case of tungsten the high vapor pressure oxide is W02 which sublimates at 8000C.
