## Description
STABILISED POLYESTER COMPOSITIONS This invention relates to biologically produced poly ss hydroxybutyric acid compositions having improved thermal stability and to methods for the production thereof. Poly ss hydroxybutyric acid is a thermoplastic polyester consisting of repeat units of the formula CH CH3 .CH2.CO.O which is accumulated by many micro organisms, particularly bacteria, for example of the genera Alcaligenes,Athiorhodium, Azotobacter, Bacillus, Nocardia,Pseudomonas, Rhizobium, and Spirillium, as an energy reserve material. The polymer is conveniently prepared by cultivating the micro organism in an aqueous medium on a suitable substrate, such as a carbohydrate or methanol, as an energy and carbon source. The substrate must, of course, be one that is assimilable by the micro organism. In order to promote accumulation of the polymer, at least part of the cultivation is preferably conducted under conditions wherein there is a limitation of a nutrient that is essential for growth of the micro organism but which is not required for polymer accumulation. Examples of the suitable processes are described in European PatentSpecification 15669 and in European Patent Application 81303373. Polymers containing both 8 hydroxybutyric acid units and other hydroxycarboxylic acid units, such as ss hydroxyvaleric acid units, can also be produced microbiologically. Thus a microbiologically produced heteropolymer containing ss hydroxybutyric acid and 8 hydroxyvaleric acid residues is described byWallen et al in Environmental Science and Technology 8 1974 576 9. Also, as described in United Kingdom PatentApplication 8120991 various copolymers can be produced by cultivating the micro organism on certain substrates, such as propionic acid which gives rise to 8 hydroxyvaleric acid units in the copolymer. While cells containing the polymer can be used as such as a moulding material, for example as described inUSP 3 107 172, it is generally desirable to separate the polymer from the remainder of the cell material. Methods that have been proposed to effect this separation include breakage of the cells by methods such as treatment with acetone, followed by extraction of the polymer from the broken cells by treatment with a solvent in which the polymer is soluble. Examples of such processes are described in USP s 3 036 959 and 3 044 942 in which the solvents employed are pyridine or mixture of methylene chloride and ethanol. Other extraction solvents for the polymer in the form in which it is produced in the cells include cyclic carbonates such as 1,2 propylene carbonate see USP 4 101 533 chloroform see USP 3 275 610 , and 1,2 dichloroethane as disclosed inEuropean Patent Specification 15123 . USP 3 275 610 discloses other methods of cell breakage viz. ultrasonic vibration, grinding, French pressing, freezing thawing cycles and lysozyme treatment, while, as described in the aforementioned European PatentSpecification 15123, spray or flash drying of the suspension of cells as produced by culturing the microorganism can also cause sufficient cell breakage to enable the polymer to be extracted from the cells. The polymer extracted from the micro organism tends to exhibit discoloration or browning when subjected to shaping operations, particularly those involving heat.While this discoloration may be reduced by purification of the polymer, for example by removal of cell debris, e.g. by filtration of a solution of the polymer, and by removal of lipids, before or after separation of the polymer from the cells, e.g. by extraction with a solvent in which the lipids are soluble but in which the polymer is insoluble, the polymer tends to degrade on exposure to elevated temperatures, e.g. during melt shaping processes such as compression moulding, injection moulding, and extrusion. Copolymers can also be made containing units of other hydroxycarboxylic acids and or units derived from diols, e.g. ethylene glycol, and or dicarboxylic acids, e.g.isophthalic acid, by ester interchange occurring when the microbiolically produced polymer or copolymer is melted with such a hydroxycarboxylic acid, lactone thereof, e.g.pivalolactone, diol, dicarboxylic acid and or polyester produced therefrom. Such copolymers prepared by ester interchange are similarly liable to thermal degradation. We have now found that this thermal degradation of such S hydroxybutyric acid unit containing polymers, hereinafter referred to as HB polymers, can be substantially reduced. In the following description therefore by the term HB polymer we mean not only the homopolymer of 8 hydroxybutyric acid but also copolymers as described above containing at least 50 mole , and preferably at least 80 mole of 8 hydroxybutyric acid residues in the polymer chain. According to the invention there is provided an HB polymer composition characterised in that it contains anHB polymer and a sufficient quantity of a polyethylenically unsaturated compound containing at least two reactive groups of the formula CH CR1 in whichR1 is hydrogen, a lower alkyl or a phenyl radical and in which compound R1 may differ from one CH CR1 group to another with the proviso that where the compound contains only two groups of the formula CH CR1 , they are not both contained in EMI4.1 groups where R is hydrogen, a lower alkyl, or a phenyl radical to improve the melt stability of the HB polymer.By lower alkyl radical is meant radicals containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms. Surprisingly, polyethylenically unsaturated compounds containing reactive groups of the above formula are more effective stabilisers than1 for example, compounds containing two groups of the formula EMI4.2 for example two acrylate or methacrylate groups. Improved results are generally obtained when the composition also contains a free radical generating agent although the polyethylenically unsaturated compounds may be effectively activated by elevated temperatures or by shear such as experienced in melt mixing in an extruder. The composition may consist simply of a physical blend of the components of the composition so that any chemical interaction between the HB polymer and the polyethylenically unsaturated compounds only takes place when the composition is melted during or prior to fabrication. In such a case the polyethylenically unsaturated compound should have only limited volatility at the temperature of the melt so that it is not volatilised from the melt. Alternatively, the composition may already have been melt compounded so that the composition consists of an HB polymer which has been chemically modified by the polyethylenically unsaturated compound. In this case the polyethylenically unsaturated compound used may have greater volatility because the melt can be compounded in a closed system to give the chemically modified polymer.Whatever method is chosen it is desirable to achieve the maximum degree of dispersion of the additive in the polymer melt to ensure the most effective use of the additive. Accordingly there is also provided an RB polymer composition characterised in that it has been prepared by reacting an HB polymer with at least one polyethylenically unsaturated compound as hereinbefore defined, in a melt of the HB polymer optionally in the presence of a freeradical generating agent. The improvement in stability brought about by the addition of the specified additives may be measured by the effect the additives have on the melt viscosity of the HB polymer. This may conveniently be assessed by measuring the change in melt flow time through a capillary die. By a melt flow time is meant the time taken for a 1 gram sample of the RB polymer to flow through a die of length 8 mm and diameter 2.095 mm under a load of 2.16 kg at a temperature of 1900C 10C after a heating up period of 5 minutes. This method of assessment is substantially as described in British Standard 2782 7 720A 1979 . The melt flow time is a measure of the thermal stability of the RB polymer. Microbiologically produced HB polymers which have subsequently been purified by the known methods have a melt flow time of 4 to 6 minutes.The polymers resulting from reaction with the specified additives have melt flow times which are significantly above these values. Accordingly in a further embodiment of the invention there is provided a modified biologically produced HB polymer composition having a melt flow time which is at least double that of the RB polymer itself. Polyethylenically unsaturated compounds are known in the art and are widely used as cross linking agents in a variety of polymers. They are most usually used by incorporation during the process of polymerising the said polymers. However the RB polymer compositions of the present invention are produced by the addition of the polyethylenically unsaturated compounds to a preformed HB polymer. One class of polyethylenically unsaturated compounds which may be used have at least two addition polymerisable unsaturated groups of the formula EMI6.1 where R and R1 may be the same or different and are selected from hydrogen, lower alkyl or phenyl radicals andR2 may be a hydrogen or lower alkyl radical. It is preferred that at least three addition polymerisable unsaturated groups be present in the compound. These groups may be such that they have equal reactivity, that is, they will react at the same rate as each other in free radical reactions, or they may have substantially different reactivities. Typical materials of this type are compounds containing two or more allyl, methallyl and crotonyl radicals such as diallyl fumarate, triallyl phosphate, triallyl cyanurate and isocyanurate, tetra allylhydroxy ethane, diallyl succinate, diallyl terephthalate, diallyl carbonate, ethylene glycol bis allyl carbonate , di , tri and tetra ethylene glycol bis allyl carbonates , glyceryl trisallyl carbonate, ethylene glycol bis 2 chloroallyl carbonate and corresponding methallyl derivatives of these carbonates. Other suitable materials within the class of compounds containing at least two addition polymerisable unsaturated groups of the formula specified are compounds containing a single group of formula EMI7.1 where R and R1 may be the same or different and are selected from hydrogen, lower alkyl or phenyl radicals andR2 may be hydrogen or lower alkyl, together with at least one different ethyl en ically unsaturated group such as a group of formula EMI7.2 where R and R1 are as previously specified for example, allyl acrylate, allyl methacrylate, methallyl acrylate and methallyl methacrylate. Although compounds containing only two groups of formula CH CR1 , both of which are EMI7.3 groups are not included within the invention because they are not sufficiently effective in improving the melt stability of PHB, additives containing at least three groups of formula EMI7.4 are included within the invention. Specific compounds of this type which are suitable for use in the invention are pentaaerythrityl triacrylate, pentaaerythrityl monohydroxypentaacrylate, and glyceryl and trimethylolpropane triacrylates. The RB polymer composition should generally be processed at a temperature above the melting point of both the polyethylenically unsaturated compound and the RB polymer. By the melting point of the RB polymer we mean the temperature of the peak in the melting endotherm as determined by differential scanning calorimetry. Where the HB polymer exhibits two or more such peaks, as in the case of certain RB copolymers, the melting point is deemed to be the temperature of that peak occurring at the higher, or highest, temperature. Particularly useful are polyethylenically unsaturated compounds which have a melting point close to the processing temperature of the HB polymer. Thus compounds which have a melting point which is within the range from about 20 C below the melting point of the HB polymer, which is about 180 C for 8 hydroxybutyric acid homopolymer, to about 20 C above the melting point of the HB polymer are particularly suitable for use in the invention. Preferably the polyethylenically unsaturated compound should have a melting point within the range from about 0 100C below the melting point of the HB polymer. A material which meets these requirements is the allyl substituted diamide, diallyl tartardiamide. Other substituted amides of formula EMI8.1 where R, R1 and R2 are as specified previously and HN OC X CO JH is a residue of a diamide, may be used, particularly those having a melting point just below that of the HB polymer. Another class of polyethylenically unsaturated compounds containing at least two reactive groups of the formula CH CR1 which have been found to be effective are the maleimides, particularly the dimaleimides of formula EMI9.1 where Q is a divalent aliphatic, aromatic or cycloaliphatic radical. Typical examples of suitable maleimides are N,N ethylene dimaleimide, N,N p phenylene dimaleimide, N,N m phenylene dimaleimide and 4,4 bismaleimide diphenyl methane. The polyethylenically unsaturated compounds are preferably present in the composition of the invention at a concentration of 0.1 to 10 by weight and desirably within the range 0.5 to 5.08 by weight. These compounds have been found to be most effective when used in the presence of a free radical generating agent which will generate free radicals at temperatures at which the HB polymer melts. Suitable free radical generators will always have a half life of 0.01 hour at 1300C, but preferred materials have half lives at 1300C, of at least 1.0 hours. Suitable classes of initiator include a wide range of peroxides such as hydroperoxides, dialkyl peroxides, peresters, perketals, ketone peroxides, acyl peroxides, percarbonates and mixtures of these. As examples of hydroperoxides there may be mentioned tert butyl hydroperoxide tert amyl hydroperoxide 1,1,3,3 tetramethylbutyl hydroperoxide cumene hydroperoxide di isopropyl benzene hydroperoxide paramenthane hydroperoxide pinane hydroperoxide 2,5 dimethyl 2, 5 dihydroperoxy hexane and 2,5 dimethyl 2,5dihydroperoxy hex 3 yne. As examples of dialkyl peroxides there may be mentioned di tert butyl peroxide di tert amyl peroxide tert amyl tert butyl peroxide butyl 2 hydroxyethyl peroxide di tert butyl decamethylene bisperoxide tert butylcumyl peroxide dicumyl peroxide a,a bis tertbutylperoxy di isopropyl benzene 2,5 dimethyl 2,5 ditert butylperoxy hexane 2, 5 dimethyl 2, 5 di tert butylperoxy hex 3 ene and 2,5 dimethyl 2,5 di tertbutylperoxy hex 3 yne. As examples of peresters there may be mentioned tert butyl peroctoate tert butyl perpivalate tert butyl perisononanoate tert butyl perneodecanoate tertbutylperoxy crotonate di tert butyldiperoxy succinate 1,1,3, 3 tetramethylbutylperoxy 2 ethyl hexanoate tertbutyl perbenzoate tert butyl monoperphthalate di tertbutyldiperoxyphthalate phthalide peroxide 2,5 dimethyl hexane 2,5 diperbenzoate and 2,5 dimethyl hexane 2,5peroctanoate. As examples of perketals there may be mentioned 2,2bis tert butylperoxy butane 2,4 pentane dione peroxide l,l bis tert butylperoxy cyclohexane and 3,3,5 trimethyll,l bis tert butylperoxy cyclohexane. As examples of ketone peroxides there may be mentioned methyl ethyl ketone peroxide methyl isobutyl ketone peroxide methyl amyl ketone peroxide acetyl acetone peroxide and bis l hydrpxycyclohexyl peroxide. As examples of acyl peroxides there may be mentioned lauroyl peroxide benzoyl peroxide di 4 chlorobenzoyl peroxide and bis 2,4 dichlorobenzoyl peroxide. As an example of a percarbonate there may be mentioned tert butyl peroxyisopropyl carbonate. These may be present at lower concentrations than the polyfunctional additives, preferably from 0.01 to 2.08 by weight of the total composition. The performance of the free radical generators may be advantageously modified by the inclusion of free radical inhibitors such as para tert butyl catechol. The optimum amounts of ingredients are assessed by assessing the thermal stability of the composition as measured by the melt flow index of the composition relative to the unstabilised composition at a given temperature at which the RB polymer will be molten since the melt flow index of the composition can change within the time scale of the measurement, a convenient parameter for assessing stabilisers is the flow time of a standard weight sample. The quantities of stabilising ingredients present should be sufficient to increase the flow time compared to that of the unstabilised polymer by a factor of 2 or more and preferably by a factor of 4 or more when assessed according to the method hereinbefore defined. The invention is further illustrated by reference to the following examples. Throughout the examples the proportions of additives are expressed as by weight of the total composition. EXAMPLE 1 Samples containing 1 g of dry a powdered HB copolymer and the additives shown in Table 1 were blended in 2 ml of methylene chloride and dried in an oven at 60 C for 30 minutes. The blend was then rapidly charged into a standard melt flow grader made by Davenports, Welwyn Garden City,UK fitted with a standard die length 8 mm, diameter 2.095 mm and pre heated to 190 C 0.50C. After 5 minutes warming up time, the contents of the grader were extruded using a 2 kg weight on the piston weight 0.16 kg and the total flow time noted. A control sample of the NB polymer without additives was similarly treated and the increase in flow time for the blended samples was calculated with respect to the flow time of the control. The results are given in Table 1. The HB polymer was a S hydroxybutyric acid homopolymer produced by aerobic cultivation of Alcaligenes eutrophus mutant S301 C5 NCIB 11599 in an aqueous medium using glucose as a substrate. The polymer was isolated by extraction from the aqueous cell suspension with 1,2dichloroethane at room temperature followed by separation of the solvent layer, containing the dissolved polymer, from the aqueous layer by decanting. The solution was filtered and then the polymer was precipitated by adding the solution to a methanol water mixture. The precipitated polymer was separated by filtration and dried.

The extruded lace was crystallised in a water bath at 600C and pelletised using a standard lace cutter. The resulting granules were dried overnight in a vacuum oven at 600C and their melt stability evaluated using the standard melt flow test described in Example 1.
