## Abstract
A method of locating an object by wave energy reflec tion and an apparatus therefor in which receiving outer transducers 11R, 11L or 111R, 111L provide directional receptivities represented by polar lobes diverging on op posite sides of a reference axis 15 and an inner receiving transducer 13 or simulated from 111R, 111L provide a directional receptivity represented by a narrower polar lobe centered on the reference axis. The signals received from the outer transducers 11R, 11L or 111R, 111L are operat ed upon in channels II, III of the receiver to modulate them with a frequency swept local signal derived from the transmitted signal and develop indicator signals of difference frequency between the transmitted and received frequencies and which represent the range of the object. The outer signals are displayed binaurally, to enable the user to achieve firstly approximate directional sensing by binaural effect, and thereafter more accurate directional sensing by the use of signals developed in a central channel IV and derived from the inner transducer 13 or outer transducers 111R, 111L simulating an inner transducer. Gain in chan nels II and III fed from the outer transducers is preferably adjusted as an inverse function of signal strength in the channel IV . Higher frequency components are preferably accentuated in the inner channel to improve object character recognition.
