# Hydraulically operated four wheel sweeper.

## Abstract
A hydrostatically operated vehicle, such as a street sweeper, includes an engine driven reversible hydrostatic pump coupled to a single hydrostatic pump driving wheels of the vehicle. The pump is shiftable from neutral to reverse and forward, low and high speed positions, and the hydros tatic motor is controlled between low and high speed positions with a metering valve automatically adjusting the motor speed in response to variation in reaction torque between the drive wheels and the ground. The vehicle also includes a reversible hydrostatic component drive system for powering motors which drive an elevator, pick up broom and two gutter brooms in a forward working direction and which may be reversed for clearing debris jams by reversing the pump. The component drive system includes valve means for selectively driving the gutter brooms and for holding the gutter brooms inactive when the pump is driven in reverse.
