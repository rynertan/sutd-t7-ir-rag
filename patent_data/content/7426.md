# Catalytic cracking process.

## Abstract
Metals such as nickel, vanadium and iron contaminating a cracking catalyst are passivated by contacting tha contami nated catalyst with a passivating agent dissolved in a secon dary feedstock stream having a temperature sufficiently low to avoid or minimize decomposition of the passivating agent until the contacting of said cracking catalyst with said pas sivating agent.
