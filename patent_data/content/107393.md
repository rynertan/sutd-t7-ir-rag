# Method of manufacturing master slice integrated circuit device.

## Abstract
A method of manufacturing a master slice integrated circuit device, implemented based on a total circuit diagram, including one or more logic blocks, each comprising a plurality of basic blocks such as flip flops, NAND gates, and the like. The total circuit diagram is reformed by deleting unused basic logic blocks whose output terminals are not used among said basic logic blocks in each of said logic blocks, deleting unused wiring and other unused basic logic blocks whose output terminals are not connected to any basic logic blocks as a result of the deletion of said basic logic blocks, and sequentially deleting unused basic logic blocks and unused wiring in the same manner, such as to retain only those basic logic blocks actually used as effective basic logic blocks. The circuit patterns of said master slice integrated circuit device are produced from the total circuit diagram thus reformed.
