# COUPLING STRUCTURE FOR WATER CHANNELS.

## Abstract
A coupling structure for strengthening agricultural or in dustrial water channels is composed of a number of prefabri cated concrete products connected in series against any set tlement and upheaval. Connecting plates 1a, 1b are engaged with recesses 8,8 formed at adjacent concrete products 5, 5 , respectively, and a bolt 9 is screwed through tightening hole 2 into an insert 6 . After a bolt 10 is passed through a hole 13 of an eccentric seat plate 11 , the bolt is screwed through a tightening hole 3 into an insert 7 . When the seat plate 11 is rotated, the adjacent concrete products 5, 5 are urged towards each other. A stopper 4a is provided in addi tion to a stopper 4b . Even if compressive force occurs be tween the concrete products 5 and 5 due to the settlement or upheaval, it is partially born by the bolt 9 , the plates 1a, 1b , the seat plate 11 , and the bolt 10 .
