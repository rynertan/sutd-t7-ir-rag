# Progressive scan video processor.

## Abstract
A digital video signal processing circuit generates non interlaced lines of video information progressive scan from interlaced composite color video signal includ ing a luminance signal which contains vertical detail inform tion without peaking. There are two progressive scan speed up processors PSP1,PSP2 functioning in parallel and controlled to operate alternately, the one in a reading mode and the other in a writing mode, and vice versa. Each receives the interlaced luminance and chrominance signals. In each of the speed up processors, a line of chrominance signals I,Q is time compressed and repeated to generate two lines
