# Novel foam and process for producing same.

## Abstract
A novel foam composed of closed cells having an average cell diameter of 0.05 3 mm, said foam having a foam density of 0.007 0.10 g cm³, a variation in cell wall thickness of 30 or less and a variation factor of cell diameter of 70 or less can be produced by foaming a composition consisting essentially of 100 parts by weight of substantially non crosslinked ethylenic polymer having a density of 0.935 g cm³ or more and a melting point of 117 C or more and 0.05 10 parts by weight of a foam ing decelerant having an ability to prolong the foaming time by at least one second as compared with the case of absence of the foaming decelerant as measured by a glass tube blowing test method. Said foam is excellent in mechanical properties and heat resistance and has a good appearance.
