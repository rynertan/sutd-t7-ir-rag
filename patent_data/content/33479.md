# Arc extinguishing arrangement for electric current limiting circuit breakers.

## Abstract
Arc extinguishing arrangement in breaking devices, such as electric circuit breakers, comprising a deionizing assembly or arc chute and an arc motivating assembly flanking the contacts of the breaker. The deionizing assembly in its preferred form comprises a high number of deionizing arc plates made of a thin magne tic sheet bent in a U shaped configuration with the curved portion of the U facing the contacts and the arms of the U insulated from each other by means of a thin insulating layer. The function of the deionizing assembly is one of blowing, splitting up and cooling the arc to extinction. The arc motivating assembly in its preferred embodiment is formed by two columns of ferromagnetic material plates, wherein the magnetic circuit of said columns may be com pleted by a traverse yoke of a ferromagnetic material and wherein said columns and said yoke may be embedded in an insulating material forming a coating and filling the gaps between the ferromagnetic plates such as to form an arc confining chamber. The function of the arc motivating assembly is both that of pushing the arc toward the arc chute and of accelerating the opening of the breaker contacts.
