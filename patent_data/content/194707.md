## Description
The invention relates to a process for the hydrocarboxylation of an acetylenically unsaturated compound by reaction thereof with carbon monoxide and a carboxylic acid in the liquid phase. It is known that acetylenically unsaturated compounds can be hydrocarboxylated by reaction thereof with carbon monoxide and a carboxylic acid to yield carboxylic anhydrides. According to a process known from U.S. patent specification 3,641,137 a catalytic system is formed by combining a compound of divalent palladium and an organic phosphine in a quantity of organic phosphine generally in excess for example 10 300 of that stoichiometrically required to form a complex with the palladium metal. A ratio mol of organic phosphine to gramatom of divalent palladium of 4 was used in the two examples of this known process, the excess being 100 . This known process has a very low reaction rate, which renders it rather unattractive for use on a commercial scale. Applicant has increased the molar ratio of organic phosphine to gramatom of divalent palladium to a value in excess of 300 , but still found a low rate of reaction. It has now surprisingly been found that the reaction rate can be very much enhanced when exceptionally high values are used for said molar ratio. The invention, therefore, provides a process for the hydrocarboxylation of an acetylenically unsaturated compound by reaction thereof with carbon monoxide and a carboxylic acid in the liquid phase, which process is carried out in the presence of a catalytic system formed by combining a compound of divalent palladium and a tri organic phosphine in a ratio mol of tri organic phosphine to gramatom of divalent palladium of more than 15. The process according to the present invention, moreover, allows very high selectivities to carboxylic anhydrides. The selectivity to carboxylic anhydrides, expressed in a percentage, is defined as in which a is the amount of acetylenically unsaturated compound that has been converted into carboxylic anhydrides and b is the total amount of acetylenically unsaturated compound that has been converted. Preferably, a ratio mol of tri organo phosphine to gramatom of divalent palladium of not more than 500 is used, but higher ratios, for example up to 2000, are not excluded. The quantity of divalent palladium is not critical. Preference is given to the use of quantities in the range between 10 ⁵ and 10 ¹ gramatom palladium per mol of acetylenically unsaturated compound. According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention the tri organic phosphine has the general formula I in which R¹ represents an optionally substituted aryl group and R² and R³ each an optionally substituted alkyl, optionally substituted cycloalkyl or optionally substituted aryl group, or R² and R³ together represent an optionally substituted alkylene or optionally substituted phosphacyloalkylenegroup. However, the use of trialkylphosphines or tricycloalkylphosphines is not excluded. Preferably, in the general formula I any alkyl group has up to 20 carbon atoms and any cycloalkylgroup up to 7 carbon atoms and any aryl group up to 18 carbon atoms in the ring. Any aryl group may be an anthryl, naphthyl or, which is preferred, a phenyl group. Phosphines of the general formula I in which R¹ and R² each represent an optionally substituted phenyl group are a preferred group of phosphines within this group those phosphines in which R³ also represents an optionally substituted phenyl group are particularly preferred. Very good results have been obtained with triphenylphosphine. Other examples of suitable phosphines are phenyldiethylphosphine, ethyldiphenylphosphine, phenyldipropylphosphine and propyldiphenylphosphine. An optionally substituted alkylene group formed by R² and R³ suitably has in the range of from 4 to 9, for example from 6 to 8 carbon atoms, and such a group may form a monocyclic or a bicyclic ring containing the phosphorous atom. An example of such a compound is 7 n eicosylphosphabicyclo 2,2,1 heptane. Another preferred group of tri organic phosphines are those of the general formula I in which R³ represents a chain of carbon atoms ending with the group PR⁴R⁵, in which R⁴ represents an optionally substituted phenyl group and R⁵ an optionally substituted alkyl, optionally substituted cycloalkyl or optionally substituted phenyl group. Preferably, R⁴ and R⁵ are equal to R¹ and R², respectively. The chain of carbon atoms suitably comprises 2 to 6 carbon atoms. Examples of suitable phosphines are 1,2 di diphenylphosphino ethane, 1,2 di diphenylphosphino ethene, 1,2 di diphenylphosphino ethyne, 1,2 di ditrifluoromethylphosphino ethane, 1,2 di diphenylphosphino benzene, 1,2 di diphenylphosphino 3,3,4,4 tetrafluoro 1,2 cyclobutene, 1,2 di diphenylphosphino 3,3,4,4,5,5 hexafluoro 1,2 cyclopentene, 1,2 di diphenylphosphino 3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6 octafluoro 1,2 cyclohexene, bis o diphenylphosphinophenyl phenylphosphine and tris o diphenylphosphinophenyl phenylphosphine. Mixtures of two or more tri organic phosphines may be used. It has, moreover, been found that even more enhanced reaction rates with the same high selectivity to carboxylic anhydrides can be obtained when benzenephosphonic acid and or a 2 mono , 2,2 di and or 2,2,2 trihaloalkanoic acid is also incorporated in the catalytic system. This alkanoic acid is preferably acetic acid. Among the halo atoms chlorine and fluorine atoms are preferred. Very good results have been obtained with trifluoroacetic acid. Benzenephosphonic acid and the 2 mono , 2,2 di and 2,2,2 trihaloalkanoic acids are suitably used in combination with triarylphosphines in which the aryl group is unsubstituted or carries an electron donating substituent. Combination of orthophosphoric acid with triarylphosphines in which the aryl group is unsubstituted or carries an electron donating substituent does not enhance the reaction rate. Examples of electron donating substituents are p alkoxy groups para with respect to the C P bond , particularly those having not more than 5 carbon atoms in the alkoxy group, for example p methoxy and p ethoxy groups. An example of such a phosphine is tri p methoxyphenyl phosphine. Other examples of suitable electron donating groups are methyl, ethyl, n propyl, isopropyl, tert. butyl, dimethylamino and diethylaminogroups. If desired, a triarylphosphine in which each aryl group carries an electron withdrawing substituent may be used such phosphines are suitably used in combination with p toluenesulphonic acid, orthophosphoric acid and or a 2 mono , 2,2 di and or 2,2,2 trihaloalkanoic acid. Among the halo atoms chlorine and fluorine atoms are preferred. Very good results have been obtained with trifluoroacetic acid. Examples of electron withdrawing substituents are chlorine, bromine, monochloromethyl, trichloromethyl, trifluoromethyl, nitro and m methoxy meta with respect to the C P bond groups. Very good results have been obtained with chlorine atoms, particularly with tri m chlorophenyl phosphine. Both homogeneous and heterogeneous palladium catalysts may be used in the process according to the invention. Homogeneous catalysts are preferred. Suitable homogeneous catalysts are the salts of palladium with, for example, nitric acid, sulphuric acid or alkanoic acids having not more than 12 carbon atoms per molecule. Salts of hydrohalogenic acids may, in principle, be used, but they have the drawback that the halogen ion may have a corrosive effect. A compound used by preference is palladium acetate. Moreover, palladium complexes may be used, for instance palladium acetylacetonate, tetrakistriphenylphosphinepalladium, bis tri o tolylphosphinepalladium acetate or bistriphenylphosphinepalladium sulphate. Palladium bonded to an ion exchanger for instance an ion exchanger comprising sulphonic acid groups is an example of a suitable heterogenous catalyst. The number of equivalents of the tri organic phosphine which is used per equivalent of benzenephosphonic acid, 2 mono , 2,2 di or 2,2,2 trihaloalkanoic acid, p toluenesulphonic acid or orthophosphoric acid, if used at all, is not critical and may vary between wide limits. Suitably, in the range of from 0.5 to 50 equivalents of the tri organic phosphine are used per equivalent of such acid. A separate solvent is not essential in the process according to the invention, and often a large excess of one of the reactants, usually the carboxylic acid, may form a convenient liquid phase. However, it may in some cases be desirable to use a separate solvent, in which case any inert solvent may be used. A suitable solvent may, for example, be selected from sulphoxides and sulphones, for example dimethyl sulphoxide, diethyl sulphoxide, dimethyl sulphone, diethyl sulphone, methyl ethyl sulphone, diisopropyl sulphone, methyl butyl sulphone or tetrahydrothiophene 1,1 dioxide also referred to as sulfolane , 2 methylsulfolane, 3 methylsulfolane, 2 methyl 4 butylsulfolane, aromatic hydrocarbons, for example benzene, toluene or one or more of the xylenes, ketones, for example acetone or methyl isobutyl ketone, esters, for example methyl acetate and butyrolacetone, and N methylpyrrolidone, and ethers. Very good results have been obtained with ethers, in particular with anisole and diphenyl ether. Other examples of suitable ethers are 2,5,8 trioxanonane also referred to as diglyme , dimethyl ether, diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, methyl t butyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, 4 dioxane, 1,3 dioxane and the dioxolanes. The process according to the invention permits the use of very mild reaction conditions. Temperatures in the range of from 50 C to 200 C, especially 100 C to 150 C, are generally suitable. The pressure may vary over a wide range. Generally, a pressure in the range of from 1 to 100 bar is suitable, with pressures of from 5 to 50 bar being preferred. Pressures higher than 100 bar may be used, but are usually economically unattractive. The carboxylic acid which is to be reacted with the acetylenically unsaturated compound may be used in a molar ratio carboxylic acid to acetylenically unsaturated compound which is not critical, may vary between wide limits and is generally in the range of from 0.1 1 to 10 1. The process according to the invention may be carried out using a wide variety of acetylenically unsaturated compounds and it is not excluded that such compounds carry one or more substituents which are inert under the reaction conditions, such as halogen atoms and cyano, ester, alkoxy and aryl groups. In addition, the acetylenically unsaturated compound may contain one or more substituents which are not inert under the reaction conditions, for example hydroxy groups. The fate of such groups will depend on the precise reaction conditions. One or more acetylenically unsaturated bonds may be present in any position in the carbon chain. Very good results have been obtained with unsubstituted alkynes, particularly with those having up to 20 carbon atoms per molecule, more particularly with ethyne and propyne. Other examples of suitable alkynes are 1 butyne, 2 butyne, 1 pentyne, 1 hexyne, 1 heptyne, 1 octyne, 2 octyne, 4 octyne, 5 methyl 3 heptyne, 4 propyl 2 pentyne, 1 nonyne, benzylethyne and cyclohexylethyne. A wide range of carboxylic acids may be used as reactant in the process according to the invention. For example, the carboxylic acid may be aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or aromatic, and may carry one or more inert substituents, for example those described hereinbefore for the acetylenically unsaturated compound. The carboxylic acid suitably contains up to 20 carbon atoms. One or more carboxylic groups may be present, in which case different products can be obtained as desired depending upon the molar ratio of reactants used. The carboxylic acid may be, for example, an alkanoic acid or an alkenoic acid. Examples of suitable carboxylic acids are formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, n butyric acid, isobutyric acid, pivalic acid, n valeric acid, n caproic acid, caprylic acid, capric acid, decanoic acid, lauric acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, benzoic acid, o phthalic acid, m phthalic acid, terephthalic acid, benzoic acid and toluic acid. Examples of alkenoic acids are acrylic acid, propiolic acid, methacrylic acid, crotonic acid, isocrotonic acid, oleic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, citraconic acid and mesaconic acid. If an alkanoic acid having n 1 carbon atoms per molecule is reacted with an alkyne having n carbon atoms per molecule, a symmetrical anhydride is produced. Otherwise, a mixed anhydride is initially produced. If it is desired to prepare a particular acid by the process according to the invention, it may for example be convenient to react one mol of said acid with the corresponding alkyne having one less carbon atom to produce the symmetric anhydride, to hydrolyse this anhydride to produce two mol of acid and to recycle one mol of said acid back to the first stage of the process. Depending on the presence of further compounds, further reactions may take place. For example, if the process according to the invention is carried out in the presence of an amine, this amine may react with the carboxylic anhydride with formation of a carboxylic acid and an amine carboxylate. For example, reaction of propyne with carbon monoxide and methacrylic acid in the presence of piperidine yields 1 methacryloylpiperidine in high yield. The carbon monoxide required for the process may be supplied in substantially pure form, or diluted with any inert gas, for example nitrogen. The presence of more than minor amounts of hydrogen in the gas stream is undesirable since hydrogenation of the acetylenically unsaturated compound then takes place under the reaction conditions. Generally it is preferred that the amount of hydrogen in the gas stream should be less than 5 by volume. The Examples further illustrate the invention. A 250 ml magnetically stirred Hastelloy C autoclave Hastelloy is a trade mark was charged with a solvent 40 ml , a carboxylic acid 10 ml and a catalytic system formed by combining in the autoclave palladium acetate 0.2 mmol , a phosphine and, if any, a protonic acid. The Table hereinafter shows which solvent, carboxylic acid, phosphine and protonic acid if any were used and mentions the amounts of phosphine and protonic acid if any . The autoclave was flushed with carbon monoxide, filled with propyne at a partial pressure of 2 bar and with carbon monoxide at a partial pressure of 20 bar, sealed and heated to a temperature of 115 C for the reaction time mentioned in the Table. Then, the contents of the autoclave were analysed by means of gas liquid chromatography. The reaction rates and selectivities to anydrides are presented in the Table. Comparison of Example 1 with Comparative Experiment A shows that increasing the ratio mol of phosphine per gramatom of palladium from 15 to 50 increases the reaction rate with a factor of almost 6. Comparison of Examples 2 and 3 shows that the presence of benzenephosphonic acid has increased the reaction rate in diphenyl ether with a factor 4 with unchanged high selectivity to methacrylic anhydride. Comparison of Examples 4 and 5 shows that the presence of benzenephosphonic acid has increased the reaction rate in anisole with a factor 2.6 with unchanged high selectivity to methacrylic anhydride. Comparison of Examples 2 and 6 shows that the presence of trifluoroacetic acid has increased the reaction rate with a factor 1.6 with a slight increase of the selectivity to methacrylic anhydride. Comparison of Examples 2 and 7 shows that combination of orthophosphoric acid with triphenylphosphine does not enhance the reaction rate. Examples 8, 9 and 10 show that use of tri m chlorophenyl phosphine in combination with p toluenesulphonic acid, trifluoroacetic acid or orthophosphoric acid allows good reaction rates and high selectivities to anhydrides. Comparison of Example 2 with Comparative Experiment B shows that the presence of p toluenesulphonic acid with triphenylphosphine results in an almost complete absence of catalytic activity. Comparison of Example 2 with Comparative Experiment C shows that the presence of hydrogen chloride with triphenylphosphine results in a considerable reduction of catalytic activity. The experiment of Example 3 was repeated in the presence of piperidine 5 ml . The reaction rate was 500 mol of propyne per gramatom of palladium per hour with a total selectivity to methacrylic anhydride and 1 methacryloylpiperidine of 95 . The piperidine was quantitatively converted into 1 methacryloyl piperidine.
