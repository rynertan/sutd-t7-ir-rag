## Description
This invention relates to the field of molecular biology and in particular to plasmid vectors suitable for the expression, at various levels, of genetic material in yeasts. Recently plasmids have been developed that can be used as replication vectors in yeast Struhl Yeast replication vectors are capable of autonomous replication within a yeast host organism and are therefore suitable for introducing foreign DNA into yeasts. The vectors have also been used to isolate a portion of yeast DNA for further analysis. Whilst such known systems are capable of reliable replication within a yeast host organism they are not, to a significant extent, themselves capable of expression of inserted DNA. The production of useful and interesting polypeptides by the exploitation of recombinant DNA techniques has hitherto been centred around In some situations It is an object of this invention to provide a yeast vector system capable of expressing an inserted polypeptide coding sequence. According to the present invention we provide a yeast expression vector comprising a yeast selective marker, a yeast replication origin and a yeast promoter positioned relative to a unique restriction site in such a way that expression may be obtained of a polypeptide coding sequence inserted at the restriction site characterised in that the yeast promoter comprises at least a functionally active promoter portion of the 5 region of the yeast We have used two types of yeast replication origin and selective marker which are known to the art of yeast replication vector construction. The first is based on the replication region of the natural yeast plasmid 2µ 2 micron . This plasmid is cryptic, that is it confers no readily detectable phenotype and it is present in about 100 copies per cell. In a particular example a 3.25 kb fragment from a 2µ plasmid derivative pJDB219 Beggs 1978 Nature not to scale . The The second type of yeast replication origin and marker sequence depends upon autonomous replicating sequences The EcoRI fragment shown immediately above has been used in the expression vectors of the present invention as a selection replication module. Expression vectors of the present invention containing this fragment may be stably maintained in yeast with a copy number of about 1 plasmid per cell. They segregate in an ordered fashion at mitosis and meiosis. Yeast expression vectors which include at least a portion of the 5 region of a yeast glycolytic enzyme are susceptible to expression control by varying the level of a fermentable carbon source in the nutrient medium of a yeast transformed with such a vector. A preferred fermentable carbon source is glucose. The expression vectors of the present invention include a yeast replication origin and a yeast selective marker. In a preferred embodiment these may comprise a fragment containing at least a portion of the yeast plasmid 2µ replication origin and at least a portion of the A gene inserted into a yeast expression vector of the present invention may be expressed as a fusion protein in the correct reading frame depending upon the vector chosen. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention we provide a yeast expression vector containing at least a portion of a gene coding for a polypeptide, preferably human interferon α. According to another aspect of the present invention we provide a process for the production of a polypeptide comprising expressing the said polypeptide in a yeast host organism transformed by a yeast expression vector containing a gene coding for the said polypeptide. According to another aspect of the invention we provide a kit of yeast expression vectors. The kit may comprise four or more different yeast expression vectors. The object of providing such a kit is to facilitate the molecular biologist s routine expression work by affording him a variety of vectors having either high or low copy number per cell and either high or low levels of expression. The reading frame of inserted DNA may also be selectable by choice of an appropriate vector from the kit. In a preferred embodiment we provide a kit comprising four or more different yeast expression vectors wherein the four vectors comprise all four pairwise combinations of the The present invention is now described with reference to the following Examples and to the accompanying drawings in which In the drawings restriction endonuclease maps are not drawn to scale. The restriction sites are in some cases abbreviated as follows The yeast expression vectors to be described are based on the bacterial plasmid pBR322 and use one or other of the yeast replication origin selective marker modules described above. Both modules are We have constructed, using standard techniques, a vector designated pMA3 which is composed of the We have constructed, again using standard techniques, a second vector designated pMA91 which is composed of the The two vectors pMA3 and pMA91 are described by partial maps in Figure 1. They are not vectors failing within the ambit of the present invention but rather important precursors in the production of vectors of this invention. In each case in Figure 1 the thick line indicates the sequence derived from yeast DNA. pMA3 and pMA91 DNAs were prepared by standard procedures Chinault and Carbon 1979 Gene The 1.45 kb The second available yeast promoter sequence is that of the phosphoglycerate kinase In summary two plasmids, high and low copy number, and two promoter sequences, high and low expression, are available for use in a yeast expression system. it is one aim of the invention to provide a set of vectors suitable for the expression, at.various levels, of useful genes in yeast so that expression characteristics for a given heterologous protein can be determined quite simply by selecting the appropriate plasmid. This set comprises all four pairwise combinations of the two promoters, Table 1 lists the designations of the plasmids in the kit and lists their basic properties.

The molecules are of the pMA200f1, f2 and f3 type in Table 1. We have constructed a We have determined the nucleotide sequence of the 3 region of It can be seen that there is a considerable range of expression capabilities in the system depending on which expression vector is used. The highest levels are obtained with the fusion protein vector pMA230 and the transcription vectors pMA301 and pMA3013 in which as much as 2 of the total cell protein is present as Interferon protein Figure 18 .
