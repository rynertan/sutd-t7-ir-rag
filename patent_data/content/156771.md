## Description
CEPHALOSPORINS The invention concerns a novel process for the preparation of compounds of formulaEMI1.1 wherein R1 represents hydrogen or a hydroxy protecting group, R2 represents hydrogen, a cation, the pivaloyloxymethyl group or a carboxy protecting group and R3 represents hydrogen, the acetoxy group, the carbamoyloxy group, a group S Y whereby Y represents an unsubstituted or substi tuted heterocycle, or an optionally substituted pyridinium of formulaEMI1.2 whereby R4 and R5 are the same or different and each represent hydrogen, halogen, alkyl, hydroxy, carboxamido, alkoxycarbonyl amino, monoalkylamino or di alkylamino or together represent an optionally substituted 5 or 6 membered carbocyclic ring. The compounds of formula I represent a known class of cephalosporin antibiotics e.g. Cefamandole, Cefamandole nafat, Cefonicid which is to a large extent described in patents and publications as well as protected forms thereof. In these structures R3 may be hydrogen. It can also be carbamoyloxy.However it preferably represents acetoxy or S Y. Suitable heterocylces which Y may represent are known, for example, from numerous publications.Preferred heterocycles are for example thiadiazolyl, diazolyl, triazolyl, tetrazolyl, thiazolyl , thiatriazolyl, oxazolyl, oxadiazolyl, triazolylpyridyl, purinyl, pyridyl, pyrimidinyl, pyridazinyl, pyrazolyl and triazinyl. These heterocycles may be unsubstituted or for example up to tri substituted. Suitable substituents include C1 4 alkyl, C1 4 alkoxy, halogen, trihalo C14 alkyl, hydroxy, oxo, mercapto, amino, carboxyl, carbamoyl, di C14 alkylamino, carboxymethyl, carbamoylmethyl, sulfomethyl and methoxycarbonylamino.Heterocycles mentioned in the literature as particularly preferred include tetrazolyl, especially l methyl lH tetrazol 5 yl, and 7 sulpho m.ethyl lH tetrazol 5 yl. R3 is preferably acetoxy, l methyl lH tetrazol 5 yl or l sulphomethyl lH tetrazol 5 yl. As is known in the cephalosporin field the compounds can be in the form of the free acids or of salts, for example of alkali and alkaline earth metal salts especially alkali metal salts such as sodium salts. Furthermore the compounds can also be in the form of esters, for example in the form of the pivaloyloxymethyl ester R2 pivaloyloxymethyl . Other carboxy protecting groups which R2 may represent are generally known and include for example acetoxymethyl, l acetoxyethyl, l ethoxycarbonyloxyethyl, 5 indanoyl or preferably hexanoylmethyl, phthal i dyl, carbethoxymethoxymethyl, 3 carbethoy l acetonyl. or trialkylsilyl, particularly trimethylsilyl. Compounds of formula I possess in the acylamino side chain in position 7 ofthe cephem nucleus an asymmetric carbon atom and may therefore be present in D or L Form. It is an often observed fact in cephalosporin chemistry that only one of the two epimeric forms possesses the desired antibacterial activity In the case of the compounds herein it is the derivatives of D mandelic acid which are preferred. As mentioned, the compounds of formula I are generally known, and various methods for their preparation have already been proposed, one such method comprises acylation of the corresponding, optionally protected 7 aminocephalosporanic acid derivative of formula EMI3.1 wherein R2 and R3 have the above meaning, with an activated form of the corresponding D mandelic acid derivative. Such acylation methods are known and described e.g. in AT Patent Specification 330,347 andUS Patent Specification 3,641,021. Anhydro O carboxymandelic acid of the formulaEMI3.2 and o formylmandelic acid chloride are for example employed hereby as reactive derivatives of the mandelic acid. This form of activation has however the great disadvantage that when preparing the activated derivative with phosgen or oxalylchloride, hydrochloric acid is liberated.It is known that optically active carbonic acids tend to racematise in the presence of strong acids. This results in the activated form prepared starting from the corresponding D mandelic acid derivative also containing a share of the epimeric L derivative. The acylation of compounds of formula III with these activated forms of mandelic acid therefore produces compounds of formula I which contain a share of the undesired L derivative. This partial racematisation can be demonstrated for example by reconversion of the active derivative under mild conditions to the starting material e.g. by hydrolysis using NaHC03 with ice cooling. 20Such recovered mandelic acid possesses a rotation value of ta 2D0 c 150 C H20, c 2,5 whereas pure D mandelic acid measured under the same conditions has a rotation value of 1580. This corresponds to an amount of 2 of L mandelic acid in the regenerated product. The present invention provides a process whereby the desired compound of formula I can be obtained in high yield and purity. In particular the present invention concerns a process for the preparation of compounds of formula I and their salts characterised by reacting a compound of formula IVEMI4.1 wherein R1 represents a hydroxy protecting group andEMI4.2 represents a 5 or 6 membered hererocycle which may contain in addition to the nitrogen atom one or two further heteroatoms, for example O,N and S, and which may be substituted or anellated with an optionally substituted benzene ring with a compound of formula III and if desired deprotecting the obtained end product and optionally converting an obtained product into a salt or vice versa The optical activity is fully retained as the process may be run under extremely mild and practically neutral conditions. The process is suitably carried out in a solvent inert under the reaction conditions e.g. in a chlorinated hydrocarbon such as dichloromethane, or an ester such as ethylacetate or in mixtures of such solvents.The reaction temperature is suitably from 40 to 600C, especially 15 to 250C and preferably 0 to 200C and the reaction time can vary between 1 2 to 48 hours. The reactants of formulae III and IV can be used in stoichiometric amounts. On the other hand an excess of up to 25 of the compound of formula IV may be employed. When preparing compounds wherein R2 represents hydrogen as well as their salts it may be appropriate to protect the carboxyl group in the starting material. Suitable protecting groups are known and include not only the above mentioned possible meanings for R2 but also silylester protecting groups, especially the trimethyl silyl protecting groups which may be introduced e.g. by reaction of the free acid with N,O bistrimethylsilylacetamide. After reaction of the compounds of formulae III and IV any subsequent deprotection reactions can be carried out in known manner. One of the hydroxy protecting groups preferably used in the process is the formyl group. In order to remove this formyl group it is usual to saponify in aqueous, weakly alkaline solution e.g. as described in DEPatent Specification 2,018,600. This results in the partial formation of by products and usually leads to a dark colouration of the reaction solutions. Furthermore lengthy reaction times and temperatures above room temperature are usually required. Cephalosporin derivatives are known to be unstable in the alkaline range. Even in weakly alkaline media pH value 8 9 such as used inthesaponification of formyl protected compounds of formula I they are significantly less stable than in the weakly acidic range. The invention also provides a method of deprotecting such formyl derivatives involving a mild interchange of the ester radical in the formic acid ester with an aliphatic alcohol of formula V HO R6 V wherein A6 stands for a lower, straight chain or branched alkyl group. The process is suitably carried out in acid media under mild conditions as shown in the following reaction schemeEMI5.1 This deprotection according to the invention enables rapid, careful and practically quantative preparation of compounds of formula I, wherein R1 represents hydrogen from compounds of formula I wherein R1 stands for the formyl group.By virtue of the mild conditions in acid media almost neo y product or pigment formation occurs, representing a considerable advantage over the alkaline saponification as described inDE Patent Specification 2,018,600. This deprotection can for example be carried out by dissolving a formyl protected compound of formula Ia in a alcohol of formula V, treating with an acid and under these conditions preparing a compound of formula Ib. The reaction usually takes place in an excess of the alcohol of formula V used as reaction partner as solvent.Suitable alcohols of formula V are aliphatic alcohols with 1 to 4 carbon atoms whereby the aliphatic chain may be branched. Preferred alcohols are methanol, ethanol and isopropanol whereby methanol is preferably employed.Strong organic or mineral acids may be used as acids for the catalysis of the ester exchange. The preferred acid is concentrated hydrochloric acid. The reaction is preferably carried out using an acidic ion exchanger, for example DOWEX 50 WX 4 or 8. The temperature of the ester exchange is not critical and suitably lies between 10 and 500C, preferably room temperature.The compounds of formula IV are new. The nature of the ringEMI6.1 is not critical and is decided on the basis of factors such as ease of preparation and availability of starting materials. The ring preferably represents 2 p ridyl or in particular 2 benzthiazolyl. It can be also represent pyrimidinyl, triazolyl or thiazolyl. Alternative protecting groups R1 include trialkylsilyl, particularly trimethylsilyl protecting groups. The compounds of formula IV are prepared by reacting a compound of formulaEMI6.2 whereinEMI6.3 has the above meaning with a compound of formula VII EMI7.1 wherein R1 has the above meaning. The process is preferably carried out in the presence of a tri lower alkyl or tri aryl phosphine or phosphite and a tertiary organic amide such as triethylamine or N methyl morpholine whereby the latter can be employed in a equivalent quantity to the compound of formula VI to assure neutral reaction conditions. Inert solvents not containing hydroxy groups such as dichloromethane chloroform, acetonitrile or dimethylformamide are suitable. The preparation takes place at temperatures from 50 to 500C preferably 20 to 250C. It is often the case, particularly when employing protecting groups sensitive to hydrolysis e.g. the trialkylsilyl protecting group that isolation of the activated mandelic acid derivative of formula IV is unnecessary. These may preferably be reacted in situ with the corresponding 7 aminocephem of formula III. On completion of the acylation the desired products of formula I may be isolated in accordance with known methods. The compounds of formula I are, as already mentioned, generally known antibiotics or protected forms thereof. In particular these antibiotics are indicated for use as antibacterial agents as shown in investigations in vitro using the series dilution test at a concentration of e.g. from 0.01 to 50 ug ml and in vivo at a dose of 0.1 to 100 mg kg body weight in mice against a varienty of strains e.g.Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus faecalis,E. coli, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus morganii, Shigella dysenteria, Shigella sonnei, Shigella flexneri, Alcaligenes faecalis,Klebsiella aerogenes, Klebsiella pneunomiae, Serrata marcescens, SalmonellaHeidelberg, Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella enteritidis and Nesseria gonorrhoae. The antibiotics are therefore useful as anti bacterial agents. For this use the dose to be administered depends on the compound used and the mode of administration as well as th nature of the treatment. Satisfactory results are obtained by administra tion of a daily dosage of ca. 1 to 6 g conveniently administered in correspondingly divided doses of 0.25 to 3 g two to four times daily or i retard form.
