# Box beam for use as a load carrying member and structures incorporating such box beams.

## Abstract
This specification relates to a box beam 20 with upright sides 22 which are connected to upper and lower chord plates 24, 26 all of which are constructed of corrugated plate having corrugations 28 which run parallel to the length of the box beams and which have a large corrugation pitch and depth. The chord plates 24, 26 and sides 22 are bolted together at spaced apart intervals. Thin walled shear plates 30 are placed against the box beam sides 22 and bolted to the corrugation troughs 38 of the sides and they carry vertically acting shear loads while their connection to the box beams 20 prevents them from buckling. A longitudinal camber can be incorporated in the box beam. The box beam is specifically adapted for use in a structure such as a building or bridge and several embodiments of the latter are described utilising one or more beams arranged side by side. A load carrying deck 52 constructed of corrugated checkered metal plate is supported on the deck and a concrete layer 60 is poured on top of the bridge deck 52 so as to form a mechanical interlock between the concrete and the deck to thereby structurally integrate the concrete layer with the remainder of the bridge.
