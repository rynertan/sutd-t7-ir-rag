# Cured or curable polysulfide polymer compositions, article manufactured therefrom and processes for preparing the cured compositions and manufactured article.

## Abstract
Incorporation of levulinic acid into zinc oxide cure systems based on thioi terminated polysulfide polymers results in cured rubbers capable of extrusion under heat and pressure. The products are useful in sealants and in the fabrication of solvent resistant hoses and other ex truded articles.
