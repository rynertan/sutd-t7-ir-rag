# Two stage electric drive.

## Abstract
An electric motor drive system having a first direct current electric motor, 10 a first drive shaft 18 to which the first electric motor is coupled, a second direct current electric motor 20 having a higher power rating than the first, a second drive shaft 28 to which the second electric motor is coupled, the second drive shaft comprising a hollow sleeve with the first drive shaft extending therethrough, an epicyclic gear system 30 comprising a sun gear 32 to which the first drive shaft is coupled, a ring gear 34 to which the second drive shaft is coupled, and planetary gears 34 meshing with both the sun gear and the ring gear, an output drive 38 coupled to the planetary gears, and, a one way rotation restraining means 42 coupled to the ring gear to permit rotation of the ring gear in one direction and to prevent rotation of the ring gear in the other direction, and a method of operating such an electric motor drive system.
