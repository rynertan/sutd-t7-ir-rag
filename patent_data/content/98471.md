# Method of growing silicon crystals by the Czochralski method.

## Abstract
An improved method of growing silicon crystals by the Czochralski method to obtain a desired oxygen concentra tion level with both axial and radial uniformity. The crucible is located within the heater to achieve a given temperature profile which is related to the oxygen concentration, and then raised and rotated at an increasing speed together with a high crystal rotation rate to achieve the uniformity.
