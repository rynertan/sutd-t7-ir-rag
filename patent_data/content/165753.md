Other groups of compounds within the scope of Formula I are those disclosed in our U.S. Patent Applications Serial Nos. 619,277 686,834 724,835 638,964 and 724,451. Copies of these specifications are available for inspection on the file of the present Application. Synthesis The compounds of Formulae Ia Ic can be prepared by one or more of the methods described below in Equations 1 through 4. These procedures are equally applicable for making compounds of Formulae Id and le. Many of the compounds of Formula I can be prepared by reaction of a sulfonamide of Formula 2 with an appropriate methyl carbamate of Formula 3 in the presence of at least an equimolar amount of trimethylaluminum, according to Equation 1 Equation 1EMI22.1 These reactions are carried out at 25O to 400C under an inert atmosphere and in an inert. dipolar aprotic solvent such as methylene chloride for 10 to 96 hours. Details of this reaction as well as the preparation of the carbamates of Formula 3 can be found inEPO Publication No. 13,480. Many of the compounds of Formula I also can be prepared by reacting a sulfonylcarbamate of Formula 4 with an appropriate heterocyclic amine of Formula 5, according to Equation la. Equation laEMI22.2 EMI23.1 The reaction is carried out at 50 to lOOeC in a solvent such as 1,4 dioxane for 0.5 to 24 hours according to EPO Publication No. 44807. The required carbamates of Formula 4 are prepared by reacting the appropriate sulfonamide, 2, with diphenylcarbonate in the presence of equimolar quantities of a strong base, such as sodium or potassium hydride. Some of the compounds of Formula I also can be prepared as shown in Equation 2.Equation 2EMI23.2 wherein Y is CH3, C2H5 or CH2CF3. This reaction series is performed according to the procedures disclosed by EPO Publication No. 30,140 and the requisite heterocyclic isocyanates of Formula 6 can be prepared according to methods described inSwiss 579,062. U.S 3,919,228. U.S. 3,732.223 andU. von Gizycki. Anqew. Chem. Int. Ed. Enql. 1976, 10. 402 and 403. Compounds of Formula I also may be prepared by reaction of a thienylsulfonylisocyanate or thienyl sulfonylisothiocyanate of Formula 8 with the appropriate heterocyclic amine, as shown in Equation 3.Equation 3EMI24.1 The reaction of Equation 3 is most successful when performed in an inert dipolar aprotic solvent such as methylene chloride. tetrahydrofuran or acetonitrile at temperatures between 20 and 80 C. A catalytic amount of 1,4 diazabicyclo 2.2.2 octane Dabco may be used to accelerate the reaction. In cases where the products are insoluble in the reaction solvent. isolation may be performed by simple filtration when the products are soluble, isolation may be performed by evaporation of the solvent, trituration with a solvent such as l chlorobutane. diethyl ether or methanol and filtration. Thienylsulfonylisocyanates of Formula 8. can be prepared from sulfonamides of Formula 2 by methods described in U.S. 4.238.621, as indicated in Equation 3a. Alternatively. these sulfonylisocyanates can be synthesized via a two step procedure. consisting of 1 reacting sulfonamide 2 with n butylisocyanate in the presence of one molar equivalent of a base such as potassium carbonate in a solvent such as 2 butanone or acetonitrile. to form n butylsulfonylureas ofFormula 9 and 2 reaction of 9 with phosgene using Dabcoo as a catalyst in refluxing xylene as solvent.This method is similar to the preparation found in Newer Methods of Preparative Organic Chemistry. W. Forest. Ed.. Vol. VI, Academic Press, NY. 1967. pp.223 241. Equation 3b illustrates the procedure.Equation 3aEMI25.1 Equation 3bEMI25.2 wherein W is 0. Sulfonyl isothiocyanates of Formula 8. wherein W is S, can be prepared by treatment of sulfonamides ofFormula 2 with carbon disulfide and potassium hydroxide followed by reaction of the dipotassium salt with phosgene according to S. Hartke. Arch. Pharm., 299. 174. The compounds of Formula I also are available by the methodology described in South African Application No. 830441 and illustrated by Equation 4. Thienylsulfonamides of Formula 2 react with heterocyclic carbamates ofFormula 10 in 1.4 dioxane at 200 to 800C for periods of 1 to 24 hours when I equivalent of 1,8 diazabicyclo 5.4.0 undec 7 ene DBU is added to the reaction mixture, The resultant products are isolated by dilution of the reaction mixture with water, acidification and subsequent filtration.Heterocyclic carbamates of Formula 10 in turn are synthesized by reaction of heterocyclic amines of Formula 5 with diphenyl carbonate or phenyl chloroformate in pyridine at temperatures ranging from 20 to 80 C, as indicated in Equation 4a.Equation 4EMI26.1 10 20 to 800CEquation 4aEMI26.2 The synthesis of thienylsulfonylureas ofFormulae Ia Ic relies upon the requisite intermediate thiophenesulfonamides of Formula 2, whereas the synthesis of pyridine sulfonylureas of Formulae Id and le relies upon the intermediate pyridine sulfonamide of Formula 196 below.. Some of the intermediate sulfonamides of Formula 2 described above can be prepared from amines of Formula 11 by a two step procedure. as shown in Equation 5. This consists of 5a diazotizing 11 and coupling the diazonium salt with sulfur dioxide to form a sulfonyl chloride of Formula 12 and 5b aminating 12 with ammonium hydroxide or anhydrous ammonia to form 2. 26 Equation S EMI27.1 The reaction of Equation Sa is accomplished by treating a solution Of amine 11 in a mixture of concentrated hydrochloric acid and glacial acetic acid with a solution of sodium nitrite in water at 50 to 50C. After stirring for 10 30 minutes at about OOC to insure complete diazotization, the solution is added to a mixture of an excess of sulfur dioxide and a catalytic amount of copper I chloride or copper II chloride in glacial acetic acid at about 100C. The temperature is kept at about lO0C for 1 4 to 1 hour, then raised to 200 to 300C and held at that temperature for 2 to about 24 hours. This solution is then poured into a large excess of ice water.The sulfonyl chloride 12 can be isolated by filtration or by extraction into a solvent such as ethyl ether. methylene chloride or, preferably, l chlorobutane followed by evaporation of the solvent. The amination described in the reaction of Equation 5b above is carried out conveniently by treating a solution of the sulfonyl chloride 12 with at least two mole equivalents of anhydrous ammonia in a solvent such as ethyl ether or methylene chloride at 200 to 300 C. If the sulfonamide product 2 is insoluble, it may be isolated by filtration followed by washing out the salts with water If product 2 is soluble in the reaction solvent. it may be isolated by filtering off the precipitated ammonium chloride and evaporation of the solvent. Additionally, many sulfonamides 2 can be prepared by reaction of corresponding sulfonyl chlorides 12 with excess aqueous ammonium hydroxide in tetrahydrofuran at 0 to about 400C for 0.5 to 10 hours.The sulfonamide product 2 is isolated by evaporation of the tetrahydrofuran solvent, addition of water to the residue and filtration. Alternatively, the intermediate sulfonyl chloride 12 can be prepared as shown below in Equation 6.Equation 6EMI28.1 According to Equation 6. a lithium salt, prepared by reaction of 13 with n butyllithium in ether at about 70 C, is added to sulfuryl chloride in hexane at about 30 to 200C and stirred for 0.5 to 10 hours at 300 to 300C to yield sulfonyl chloride 12, according to teachings of S. N. Bhattacharya, C. Earborn and D. R. M. Walsh, J. Chem Soc. C 1968. 1265 and H. Quast and F. Kee, Synthesis l974. 489. Subsequent reaction of 12 with ammonia or ammonium hydroxide as described above provides the corresponding sulfonamide. Starting with an appropriate bromothiophene. and carrying out the procedures described in Equation 6, or simple modifications thereof, one skilled in th e art may prepare some of the other sulfonyl chlorides of Formula 12 described above. Of necessity, the reactions are limited to those cases in which the substituent CH2 nQ is inert to lithium reagents under the conditions of the reactions, which will be obvious to one skilled in the art. For a general review of metallation with lithium reagents, see H. W. Gschwend and H. R. Rodriguez, Orq. Reactions 1979, 26.1. Some sulfonamides 2 are best prepared by the procedure of Equation 7 below.Equation 7EMI29.1 The preparation of sulfinic acid salts 14 by the procedure of Equation 7 is well known in the art seeU.S. 4,127,405 and H. W. Gschwend et al., loc. cit.. Sulfonamides 2 are best prepared by treatment of sulfinic acid salts with chloramine. In this procedure an ethereal solution or suspension of the salt 14 is treated at low temperature 25 to 300C with a dry ethereal solution of chloramine. The reaction is stirred for a period of several minutes to several hours. After filtration. the reaction mixture is washed with aqueous bisulfite, dried and the solvent removed on a rotary evaporator. The crude product is further purified by usual methods such as crystallization or chromatography. in the reaction shown in Equation 8, a thienylcopper compound of Formula 15 is reacted with an iodoor bromoheterocycle X CH2 nQ where X is I or Br and n is 0. 1 or 2 in a solvent such as pyridine or guinoline. The copper compounds of Formula 15 are prepared by reacting the corresponding lithium compounds with cuprous iodide or cuprous bromide in a solvent such a diethyl ether. The detailed procedures for this type of reactions are described in the following references M. Nilsson and C. Ullenius, Acta Chem. Scand. 1970. 24. 2379 2388 C. Ullenius,Acta Chem. Scand. 1972, 26, 3383 3386.Equation 8EMI30.1 Treatment of the compounds of Formula 16 with an acid catalyst in an alcohol solvent or in trifluoroacetic acid removes the butyl group to yield compounds ofFormula 2 as shown in Equation 9.Equation 9EMI30.2 In the syntheses outlined above. the generalized designation of compounds of Formula I is meant to imply the CCH2 nQ substituents and the sulfonylurea functional group are bonded to the thiophene ring in adjacent positions corresponding to one of the three possible combinations designated as Formulae Ia. Ib. or Ic in the summary of the invention. It will be convenient for purposes of expediency and clarity of this teaching to use this generalized formula further in this disclosure. All values of Q, n, n . a, R1, R2, R3, R3 , R3 , R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, R9,R10, R11, n , W, W , W , A, X, Y, and Z are those described in the summary of the invention unless otherwise noted. The heterocyclic thiophenesulfonamides of Formula 2 are important starting materials for the preparation of compounds of Formula I of this invention and specific examples are prepared by the following methods. In the specific case where Q is Q 1 and n is 0, compound 17 can be prepared by the reaction sequence shown in Equation 10.Equation 10EMI31.1 In this synthetic sequence, a 1 phenylpropyne ofFormula li is metallàted with excess base. Addition of carbon disulfide leads to a phenyl substituted ketene dithiolate, which undergoes intramolecular cyclization to give 19 after proton quenching, The conditions necessary for this transformation are described by R. L. P. DeJong and L. Brandsma,J.Organometal. Chem. 1982, 238, C17. Mild oxidative chlorination of 19 leads to a sulfonyl chloride ofFormula 20, which is converted to the sulfonamide 17 by treatment with ammonia in THF solution at temperatures of 350 to 250C. Alternatively, 17 can be prepared by route ofEquation ii. 3 Phenylthiophene 21 reacts with n butyllithium in diethyl ether at 250C for 0.5 hour to form lithiated intermediates which may be quenched using sulfuryl chloride. The resultant sulfonyl chlorides 20 and 20a then are treated with ammonia inTHF solution as before to give 17 and isomeric 17a.The desired 17 can be isolated by chromatographic techniques known by one skilled in the art Metallation of 21 has been described by R. Teardini, G. Martelli, P. Spagnolo, and M. Tiecco J. Chem. Soc.,C. 1970, 1464. For further details. cf. Equation 13.Equation 11EMI32.1 EMI33.1 Other useful intermediates are known in the art. 2 Phenyl 3 bromothiophene Q 1, n is 0 may be prepared by the procedure of N. Gjoca and S. GronowitzActa Chem. Scand. 1972. 26. 1851 3 bromo 2.2 bithiophene Q 2. W is S. n is O and 3 bromo 2,3 bithiophene Q 3. W is S. n is O by the procedure of, for instance. S. Gronowitz, J. Skramstad andB. Eriksson, Ark. Kemi 1967. 28. 99. When n is 1 or 2. application of organocopper methodologies known to one in the art yield substituted thiophenes of Formula 21a, as shown inEquation lia. Thus, a dithienylcopperlithium ofFormula 21b can be reacted with alkylhalides ofFormula H to yield 21a conversion to sulfonamide 17b can be accomplished by means of Equation 11.Equation ila EMI33.2 For the isomeric compounds of Formula 17b with generic structures of Formulae 2b and 2c. similar chemistry as in Equation ila beginning with 2,3 dibromo or 3,4 dibromothiophene will provide the requisite intermediates. Equation 12 describes the synthesis of 3 2 furanyl and 3 2 thienyl thiophenes of structure 24 Q 2, n is 0 . Equation 12EMI34.1 According to the work described by H. Wynberg,A. Logothetis, and D. Verploeg J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1957, 79, 1972. 2 lithiofuran or 2 lithiothiophene is added to 3 ketotetrahydrothiophene in diethyl ether at a temperature of 0 C. The reaction is quenched with and distilled from sulfuric acid to afford 3 substituted dihydrothiophenes of Formula 22, which are dehydrogenated using 2.3 dichloro 5.6 dicyano 1.4 benzoquinone DDQ , giving thiophenes of Formula 23. These thiophenes can be metallated in the 2 position selectively and can be added to sulfuryl chloride in hexane solution. resulting in sulfonylchlorides ofFormula 24a which are converted into the desired sulfonamides 24 by treatment with ammonia in THF solution. For those cases in which n is 1 or 2. a procedure entirely analogous to that of Equation 12 may be used. beginning with Q 2 synthons of Formula 200 available commercially or obtained by methods obvious to one skilled in the art EMI35.1 compounds of Formula 24b ultimately will be producedEMI35.2 Starting with the appropriate 3 substituted thiophene and following the metallation procedure indicated in Equation 12 or simple modifications thereof. one skilled in the art may prepare many of the sulfonamides of Formula 2a. Only those 3 substituents which are inert to metallating reagents relative to the desired 2 metallation of the thiophene nucleus are compatible with this synthetic strategy such substituents will be obvious to one skilled in the art. In complement to the metallation sulfonation sequence illustrated by Equation 12. equivalent metallation sulfination may be performed to obtain the sulfonamides of Formula 2a. The latter sequence is described by Equation 13 and is entirely analogous to that of Equation 7.Equation 13EMI36.1 EMI36.2 EMI36.3 Once sulfinate salts of Formula 26 have been made, they may be transformed into sulfonamides 2a directly by reaction with chloramine as described byG. H. Coleman and C. R. Hauser J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1928, 50, all93. Sulfinate salts of Formula 26 also may be converted to 2a in a two step process chlorination to afford a sulfonyl chloride, as practiced by J. F.Sculley and E. V. Brown J. Org. Chem. 1954. 19. 894 W. E. Trull and E. Wellisch J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1952.74. 5177 and Y. K. Yuriev and N. K. Sadavaya J. Gen.Chem. USSR 1964. 34, 1814 and treatment of that sulfonyl chloride with ammonia in an ethereal solvent such as THF. Any of these procedures also are compatible with those sulfinate salts of Formula 14 generated via Equation 7. The use of the strategy of Equation 7 isVesyez O cially appealing in those cases where metallation of the 3 substituted thiophene of Formula 25 in the 2 position is not possible due to the reactivity of the CH2 nQ substituent under the conditions of metallation. Formation of the 2 brominated thiophene 27 allows for exceedingly facile, mild halogen metal exchange conditions to be used, as shown in Equation 14.Equation 14EMI37.1 Electrophilic aromatic bromination of 3 substituted thiophenes of Formula 25 leads to the 2 brominated compound of Formula 27 selectively, as shown in the teachings of S. Gronowitz. P. Moses and A. B.Hornfeldt Ark. Kern. 1962. 17, 165. Subsequent halogen metal exchange and sulfination with sulfur dioxide gives the sulfinate salt 26 or sulfonation with sulfuryl chloride leads to the sulfonyl chloride 28. In still other cases where CH2 nQ will suffer addition of most nucleophiles. CH2 nQ can be placed at the 3 position of the thiophene nucleus after the sulfonamide moiety or its synthetic equivalent has been incorporated at the 2 position.This strategy is shown in Equation 15. Equation 15EMI38.1 EMI38.2 EMI38.3 2,3 Dibromothiophene, 29 can be lithiated preferentially at the 2 position and treated with sulfuryl chloride to give the sulfonyl halide 30. Treatment with tert butylamine results in the tert butyl protected sulfonamide of Formula 31. A second lithiumhalogen exchange reaction allows for an addition of the substituent CH2 nQ, which may be added as an intact entity or as a synthetically equivalent substructure. Given the general techniques of Equations 12 through 15. sulfonamides of Formula 2a may be prepared by the methods described below. Compounds of Formula li can be prepared by use of the reaction sequence illustrated in Equation 16.Equation 16 EMI39.1 3 3 Furanyl and 3 3 thienyl 2 bromothiophenes of Formula 33 may be prepared from the methods ofY. Tamaru, Y. Yoshimi and Z. Ybshida. Tetrahedron 1979. 35. 329 or straightforward modifications thereof. By route of Equation 14 sulfonyl chlorides of Formula 34, and consequently sulfonamides 35, are obtained. Using the procedure of C. Ullenius. Acta. Chem.Scand. 1972. 26. 3383 and M. Nilsson and C. Ullenius,Acta. Chem. Scand. 1970. 24. 2379 compounds of Formula 36 Q 2, W 0, n 0 and 37 Q 3, W 0, n 0 can be prepared as shown in Equation 17. For those cases in which n is 1 or 2, straightforward modification ofEquation 17 using the appropriate furanylcopper species will result in the desired thienyibromide ofFormula 37a.

Many of these may be applied directly.Sprayable formulations can be extended in suitable media and used at spray volumes of from a few liters to several hundred liters per hectare. High strength compositions are primarily used as intermediates for further formulation. The formulations. broadly, contain about 0.1 to 99 by weight of active ingredient s and at least one of a about 0.1 to 20 surfactant s and b about 1 to 99.9 solid or liquid inert diluent s .More specifically, they will contain these ingredients in the following approximate proportions Table 18 Weight Percents Active Ingredient Diluent s Surfactant s Wettable Powders 20 90 0 74 1 10Oil Suspensions, 3 50 40 95 0 15Emulsions, Solutions, including EmulsifiableConcentrates Aqueous Suspension 10 50 40 84 1 20Dusts 1 25 70 99 0 5Granules and Pellets 0.1 95 5 99.9 0 15High Strength 90 99 0 10 0 2Compositions Active ingredient plus at least one of a Surfactant or a Diluent equals 100 weight percent. Lower or higher levels of active ingredient can.of course, be present depending on the intended use and the physical properties of the compound. Higher ratios of surfactant to active ingredient are sometimes desirable, and are achieved by incorporation into the formulation or by tank mixing. Typical solid diluents are described in Watkins, et al., Handbook of Insecticide Dust Diluents andCarriers , 2nd Ed., Dorland Books, Caldweil, NewJersey, but other solids, either mined or manufactured, may be used. The more absorptive diluents are preferred for wettable powders and the denser ones for dusts. Typical liquid diluents and solvents are described in Marsden, Solvents Guide, 2nd Ed., Interscience, New York, 1950. Solubility under 0.1t is preferred for suspension concentrates solution concentrates are preferably stable against phase separation at 000. 1Mcoutcheon s Detergents and EmulsifiersAnnual , MC Publishing Corp., Ridgewood, New Jersey, as well as Sisely and Wood, Encyclopedia of SurfaceActive Agents , Chemical Publishing Co., Inc..NewYork, 1964. list surfactants and recommended uses.All formulations can contain minor amounts of additives to reduce foaming, caking, corrosion, microbiological growth, etc, The methods of making such compositions are well known. Solutions are prepared by simply mixing the ingredients. Fine solid compositions are made by blending and, usually, grinding as in a hammer or fluid energy mill. Suspensions are prepared by wet milling see, for example. Littler, U.S. Patent 3,060,084 . Granules and pellets may be made by spraying the active material upon preformed granular carriers or by agglomeration techniques. See J. E.Browning, Agglomeration .

Utility, Utility Test results indicate that the compounds of the present invention are active herbicides. They have utility for broad spectum pre and or post emergence weed control in areas where complete control of all vegetation is desired, such as around fuel storage tanks, ammunition depots, industrial storage areas, parking lots, drive in theaters, atound billboards, highway and railroad structures. Alternatively, many of the subject compounds should be useful for the selective pre or post emergence weed control in crops, especially wheat, barley and soybeans. The rates of application for the compounds of the invention are determined by a number of factors, including their use as selective or general herbicides, the crop species involved, the types of weeds to be controlled, weather and climate, formulations selected, mode of application. amount of foliage present, etc. In general terms. the subject compounds should be applied at levels of around 0.01 to 5 kg ha, the lower rates being suggested for use on lighter soils and or those having a low organic matter content, for selective weed control or for situations where only short term persistence is required. The compounds of the invention may be used in combination with any other commercial herbicide, examples of which are those of the triazine, triazole, uracil, urea, amide, diphenylether, carbamate and bipyridylium types. The compounds may also be used in combination with mefluidide. The herbicidal properties of the subject compounds were discovered in a number of greenhouse tests. The test procedures and results follow.
