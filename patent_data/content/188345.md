# Dual frequency band antenna system.

## Abstract
A primary slotted array antenna 20 operates at 10 GHz. On the front of the primary antenna there is disposed a secondary antenna which operates at 1 GHz and is substan tially transparent at 10 GHz. The secondary antenna is formed by an array of patch radiators 13 5 and a transmis sion line feed network 23 . The radiators 13 and the feed network are all formed by a conductive grid 10 sandwiched between dielectric layers 11 and 12 and designed to achieve the transparency at 10 GHz. At 1 GHz the grid appears as a continuous conductor forming one conductor of a microstrip transmission line. 10 The other conductor ground plane is formed by the conductive front surface 22 of the primary antenna 20 . The grid dielectric sandwich 10, 11, 12 is suitably spaced from the ground plane by low dielectric pads 15 . Other embodiments use slotline or coplanar stripline techniques. The ground plane may be an integral part of 15 the secondary antenna, also constructed to be transparent at the primary frequency.
