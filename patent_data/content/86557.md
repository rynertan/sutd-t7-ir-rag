# Support for dynamoelectric machines.

## Abstract
A support system, for a dynamoelectric machine using an oil impregnated porous material. A porous bar has mechanical properties which behave in different conditions under sudden and or long duration loads. It with stands sudden forces with little deflection but deflects significantly in repose to slowly applied forces. These dual characteris tics avoid the harmful effects of additive stresses which could otherwise result from sudden loads caused by trans ient faults.
