# Photographic film pack.

## Abstract
A photographic film pack 11, which includes a stack of film units 13 received in a housing 15, has a slide 17 permanently coupled to the housing for reciprocal movement between an initial position forming part of the stack and a second position removed from the stack. Initially, the slide serves as a dark slide to shield the film units from fogging through an exposure aperture in the housing. When reciprocated, however, such as in a processing camera, the slide is guided to enter the stack to a third position behind the forwardmost film unit, and to remove that unit from the housing through an exit slot upon subsequent movement back to the second position. The slide can also support the forwardmost film unit in the exposure position, shield other than the forwardmost unit from exposure if the film units are transparent, and assist in controlling processing of the film units.
