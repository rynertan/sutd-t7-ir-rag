## Description
PROCESS FOR THE ANODIC OXIDATION OF METALS AS SHEETS, TAPES AND THE LIKE, PARTICULARLY SUITABLE FOR ALUMINIUM AND ITS ALLOYS, AND RELATED EQUIPMENT Background of the Invention 1. Field of the Invention The object of the present invention is a process for the continuous electrolytic oxidation of metals as plates, strips, and the like, particularly suitable to carry out the anodic oxidation of aluminium and its alloys. Also an equipment suitable to carry out said anodic oxidation process as a continuous process is within the scope of the invention. 2. Description of the Prior Art It is known that, due to the fact that the oxidation consists in general, as the end result, in a withdrawal of electrons from the substance to be oxidated, such an oxidation can be carried out by electrochemical way inside an electrolytic cell containing suitable solutions bath and to which electrical energy is supplied as direct current by means of electrodes the anode and the cathode , plunged inside the same bath inside these cells, the anodic area or chamber is oxidating, and the cathodic chamber is reducing. A particular and widely diffused type of electrolytic oxidation process, which takes place at the anode, is commonly denominated as anodic oxidation , or anodization process. This type of anodic oxydation is substantially an electrochemical process, which is carried out on a metal, or metal alloy surface, by causing it to operate as the anode in an electrochemical cell, in the presence of suitable acidic solutions, to the purpose of coating it with a compact oxide layer, which increases its corrosion strength to a considerable extent. The anodic oxidation is carried out on different metals, such as aluminium, zinc, titanium and still other metals, but its most diffused application is for the treatment of aluminium and its alloys. On these metals, a coating or thin layer is indeed formed of alumina Al2O3 , which coats in a continuous and uniform way all the surface of the article processed. This layer remains strongly adherent, and thanks to this tough adherence, it offers a high resistance to the corrosive action of atmosphere and of many other agents. Thus, the anodic oxidation is a protection conferring process very different from those of galvanic type galvanoplastics and electroplating in fact, the layer which is formed on aluminium and its alloys is not a deposit of substances present in the bath surrounding them, but is a transformation of electrochemical nature of the metal surface. The oxide layer which is obtained is practically inalterable up to high temperatures, it has a thickness variable as a function of the treatment, which can reach values of up to 0.1 0.15 mm, on the average of 0.05 mm with normal treatments, as well as high hardness, compactness and good clearness. Often, advantage is taken of the absorbing properties of the oxide layer, to impregnate it with dyeing materials dissolved in the bath in this case, feeding the cells with pulsating current, than with direct or rectified current, is preferable. Moreover, the growth of the oxide layer, or, better, the progress of the oxidation, is a function of the temperature created by the resistance of the bath and of the metal to the passage of current, and of the metal residence time the oxidation proceeds indeed by diffusion through the oxidated surface layer of metal ions, and of oxygen ions released by the bath. Presently, the anodizing of aluminium and of its alloys, and also of other metals, is carried out on plants, wherein large tanks made of chemically resistant materials, containing the desired bath, are provided, into which lengthes are dipped of aluminium plates, which are made act as the anode in the bath the electrodes are plunged, which are fed by direct current as cathodes, and are hanging over the tank, and can be adjusted in elevation as a function of the bath type, of the temperatures allowed, and of the plate residence times, to the purpose of achieving the desired oxide thickness on the plate. In practice, the anodizing plants of the tank type are characterized by very severe limitations from the viewpoint of the hourly production, and by considerable dead times, due to the need of removing the plates already processed, and of charging into the bath those to be processed, and of disconnecting the current supply at the end of each batch operation. By these plants of the tank type, the average production rate for plates having the usual dimensions is of about 3 metres per minute furthermore, the formation of the oxide layer occurs on both the faces of the plate, and should the oxidation on one face only be required, the other face had to be coated with proper layers of protecting, bath withstanding material, which normally should be removed before using the same plate. Summing up, the single tank type plants involve low productivity, high dead times and additional costs in case the oxidation of only one face of the plate is required. The Present Invention Purpose of the present invention is hence to provide a process for the anodic oxidation of metals, such as aluminium and its alloys, zinc, titanium and other metals, in the form of either continuous or discontinuous plates, of strips and the like, which allows the limitations and the drawbacks shown by the single bath processes of the prior art to be overcome, and above all such as to allow the anodic oxidation to be carried out on at least one face of the material to be processed, with processing continuity, whichever the lengthwise extension of the plate or strip to be processed may be. Another purpose of the invention is to provide a process of anodic oxidation able to allow, by means of sequential and partial electrolytic oxidation steps, carried out as continuous processes, high productivities, practically even ten times as higher than those made possible by the single tank process, to be achieved, always under high reliability conditions and, above all, practically without involving dead times and without requiring a large use of attending staff. A further purpose of the invention is to provide an equipment for the continuous anodic oxidation of plates, strips or the like of metal, and in particular of aluminium and its alloys, allowing said continuous anodic oxidation process to be carried out by sequential steps and with a particularly simple, reliable and easy to be used structure. These and still further purposes, which shall be evidenced more clearly by the following disclosure, are achievd by a process for the anodic oxidation of metals, such as aluminium and its alloys, zinc, titanium, and other metals, in the form of individual plates or of continuous strips, which process consists, according to the present invention, in making a plate or a sequence of plates or a strip of metal, preferably of aluminium or of alloys thereof, advance, by means of a belt conveyor or the like, through a plurality of electrolytic cells, each of said cells containing the same anodizing bath, and positioned closely approached to each other in a sequential arrangement in providing in each one of said cells an adjustable electrode, of alternatingly opposite polarity relatively to the polarity of the electrodes of the adjacent cells, so to create a sequence of oxidating anodic chambers alternated to reducing cathodic chambers, such as to create, with the metal plate being at the same time in contact with the bath of at least three of said adjacent cells, the formation of an oxide layer on the same plate, having increasingly higher thickness beginning from the first cell up to the last cell, and finally in extracting the oxidated plate from the opposite end of said set of electrolytic cells, ready to undergo the subsequent washing, drying and possible polishing treatments. More particularly, said process of anodic oxidation contemplates the use of plates of such length as to interest a number of adjacent cells having alternatingly opposite polarity not lower than three, so as to allow the creation of least a couple of oxidating and reducing chambers, forming a complete and normally energized electrolytic cell, as well as to have, after the formation of the layer in at least one of the oxidating anodic chambers, an outlet cell still operating under oxidating conditions. Such a structure provided with an end oxidating cell has resulted to be preferable in the practice, in order to prevent a trend of the oxide layer to be reduced, i.e., to decrease in thickness, as it normally occurs when the same layer passes through each cell operating under reducing conditions. Further more, theuse of a set of sequential cells, operating under anodic oxidating conditions alternated to cathodic reducing conditions, according to the present invention, allows in the practice the metal plate to be advanced at higher rates, and lower temperature increases to be obtained, both because at each passage under an anodic cell one portion only of the oxide layer is formed, and because the short residence time inside the zone operating under oxidating conditions causes lower in creases of the overall resistance offered by the bath and the plate to the current flow and hence a lower heating of the same bath. For the practical accomplishment of said process of anodic oxidation, preferably of aluminium or of its alloys, as well as of electrochemical coating of other metals, an equipment is used, equipped with a set of sequential oxidation steps, which is constituted, according to the present invention, by a support frame on which an endless belt conveyor is mounted, taut between end rollers, one of which is a drive roller, and mounted opposed to a sliding plane, on which conveyor belt a plurality of horizontal axis rollers is installed, positioned equally spaced from each other, and supported by the said support frame, at the opposite ends of said rollers stationary side walls being provided and placed in contact with the end faces of the same rollers,so as to form a staunch seal preventing the passage of liquids, each adjacent couple of said rollers constituting, together with its respective side walls, a compartment, or cell, able to receive, under sliding and staunch conditions, a metal plate or strip to be anodized, which is made advance by said conveyor belt under the same rollers at a pre established speed, furthermore in each cell defined by two adjacent rollers an electrode being associated, of polarity alternatingly opposite relatively to the polarity of the electrode of the adjacent cell, whilst to each of said cells an anodizing bath of preestablished composition is fed, said plurality of adjacent cells defining oxidating anodic chambers alternated to reducing cathodic chambers, able to cause a layer of oxide, having a thickness progressively increasing from the first cell to the last cell, to be formed on said plate, furthermore, means for the recovery of the solution leakages occurring betweer the rotary rollers and the plate, as well as means for the recycle, and the possible cooling, of the leaked solution to the individual cells defined by said roller couples, being provided. More particularly, to the purpose of allowing the plate to be anodized to easily run between the rollers and the conveyor belt under staunch conditions, the same rollers are coated with an elastically yielding material, such as rubber or the like, and are preferably mounted on supports adjustable in elevation, so to allow also the passage of plates of different thickness. The invention, as regards a preferred and not exclusive form of practical embodiment thereof, is described in the following in greater detail, with reference to the attached drawing table, given to purely indicative and not limitative purposes, wherein Fig. 1 shows a schematic view of a longitudinal median section of an equipment for anodic oxidation, having a structure according to the invention, and Fig.2 shows, it too in a schematic way, a perspective view of a portion of the equipment of Fig. 1. Referring to such figures, the equipment of the invention is constituted by an endless belt conveyor 1, of rubber, plastic or the like, taut between two end rollers 2 and 3, one of which is a drive roller, with the belt being advanced at a preselected speed by known means. Opposed to the conveyor belt 1, in the stretch between the two rollers 2 3, a sliding plane 4, of the roller type, or equipped with antifriction material, is installed, it being supported by a metal frame 5. Above the conveyor belt 1, rollers 6 6a 6b 6c and so on, of equal diamter for example, of O 150 mm are installed, positioned with their axis being horizontal, parallel to each other and a preestablished constant spacing, e.g., of 70 90 mm. The rollers are mounted with their lowermost generatrix being in low pressure contact with the belt 1, are are peripherally coated with an elastically yielding material,such as rubber, plastic, or the like. The same rollers are mounted on two opposite continuous side walls 7 8, which are placed in contact with the end faces of each roller, so to constitute a seal preventing liquid leakages. Both the side walls and the rollers are supported, by suitable end supports, by the stationary frame 5. Thus, the area defined between two adjacent rollers 6 6a 6a 6b etc., and the side walls at the end of the same rollers constitutes a chamber or cell 9 10 11 12, and so forth, the bottom of which is constituted, in the absence of the plate to be anodized, by the conveyor belt 1, as it is better explained in the following.To the set of so defined cells an oxidating bath is fed, of known type, and fit to the material to be anodized, for instance, constituted by solutions based on sulphuric, chromic, oxalic and sulphuric acids, or on dicarboxy acids of the aromatic and aliphatic series, normally suitable to be used for the anodic oxidation of aluminium and its alloys. Moreover, inside the solution contained in each cell, an electrode 13, 14, 15, 16, etc., of known type, adjustable in elevation, is provided to the electrodes a direct current is supplied, in such a way that each of them has a polarity of opposite sign, i.e., alternatingly opposite, relatively to that of the adjacent preceding cell and of the adjacent following cell, as it can be clearly observed in Fig. 1. By so doing, only anodic, i.e., oxidating cells are obtained namely, those indicated with 9 11 etc. alternated to cathodic cells namely, cells 10 12 etc.The closure of the electrical circuit between an anodic cell and a cathodic cell is made by the metal plate or strip 17, made continuously advance by the conveyor strip 1 under the set of rollers 6 6a 6b etc., so as to allow the same plate 17, which practically must have a length at least equal to the distance between three consecutive rollers, to remain in contact with the bath of a plurality of adjacent cells, thus allowing the anodic oxidation process to be carried out by sequential steps.In fact, the layer 17 slided under the rollers, i.e., between the conveyor belt 1 and the rollers 6 6a, closes the electrical circuit between the anodes and the cathodes, and because each cell, separated from the other cells, behaves, alternatingly, as oxidating anodic cell and as cathodic cell, the formation by electrochemical way of the oxide layer on the zone of the plate present inside the anodic cells occurs by sequential steps with an increase of oxide thickness each time the zone of the plate to be anodized passes through an oxidating chamber or cell. Of course, by varying the position of the electrodes, the intensity of current feed, the type of bath and the plate advancing speed, thicknesses of oxide of desired thickness and characteristics can be obtained, according to the uses the plates are intended for. It is also possible, according to the invention, to sequentially feed lengthes of metal plates also shorter than the distance between three consecutive rollers, kept under tight butt contact with each other, as to secure the continuity of the electrical energy feed to the cells, necessary to allow the process to be accomplished moreover, thanks to the elasticity of the peripheral coatings of the rollers, also feeding metal plates having variable, within certain limits, thickness is possible. For plates of definitely different thickness, the same rollers and the side walls can be mounted on supports adjustable in elevation, without altering the cells operating conditions. In the practical implementation, it has been observed that the thickness of oxide formed in each oxidating anodic cell, upon passing into the adjacent cathodic cell, undergoes a slight reduction or decrease in thickness, due to the reducing effect caused by the cathodic compartment, but such a reduction has no effect on the quality of the layer, because said layer shall immediately or nearly immediately undergo another oxidation step in the subsequent anodic cell. Better, it has been seen in practice that the passage from an anodic compartment to a cathodic compartment improves the quality of the oxide, because it favours the in situ cooling, the evolution of gas, etc. Furthermore, in order to avoid that at the outlet from the last cell the oxide layer may suffer an even slight decrease, it is preferable that the last cell be of the oxidating type, as it is shown in Fig. 1. In such a way, the reducing effect is avoided. In any case, even if the last cell results to be of the type operating under reducing conditions, the oxide layer is not appreciably influenced as for its hardness, compactness and clearness characteristics. The oxidation equipment hereinabove disclosed is then completed by a tank 18 for collecting Fig. 1 the leaked amounts and or losses of oxidating solution which unavoidingly occur between the rotary rollers and the sliding plate and between the roller ends and the related side walls. Moreover, the liquid collected in said tank 18 can be recycled to the individual cells by means of a proper pump 19, able to distribute the solution to the individual cells by means of ducts 20. Finally, the liquid drawn from the tank 18 can be properly cooled by means of a heat exchanger or the like 21, and or purified, and or filtered, before being fed back again to the cells. Of course, the continuous anodic oxidation process and the related equipment as disclosed hereinabove can be used also to the purpose of carrying out depositions of one metal on another metal, such as chromium plating, nickel plating and other processes, because also the process of electroplating to protective purposes, by only requiring the change of the bath, is always an electrochemical process which can be carried out by anodic cells alternating to cathodic cells, like the process hereinabove disclosed and being the object of the present invention. It is also obvious that, in the practical embodi ment, to the invention as hereinabove described to purely indicative, and not limitative purposes, structurally and functionally equivalent changes and modifications can be supplied, without going out of the protection scope of the same invention.
