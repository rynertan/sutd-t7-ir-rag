# RADIATION IMAGE DETECTOR AND METHOD FOR DETECTING RADIATION IMAGE USING SAID RADIATION IMAGE DETECTOR

## Abstract
A radiation image detector which comprises a photosen sitive member comprising numerous photosensitive elements in regular and two dimensional arrangement and a phosphor layer provided on said photosensitive member. A method for detecting radiation image using said detec tor which comprises steps of causing a radiation having passed through an object to impinge upon the phosphor layer of the radiation image detector and photoelectrically detect ing the light emitted from said phosphor layer upon exposure to a radiation with the photosensitive member thereof.
