# A tyre.

## Abstract
A tyre, which may be pneumatic or non pneumatic, having beads which are each provided with an elastic annular member 28, 48 or 58 axially and radially inwardly of the associated bead core 21, 41 or 51 . The carcass ply 25, 45 or 55 is wrapped axially outwards of the bead core 21, 41 or 51 and part of the annular member 28, 48 or 58 . The tyre bead seat has a taper angle which is greater than that of the rim bead seat such that on fitment of the tyre to the rim the annular member 28, 48 or 58 and the associated edge of the ply 25, 45 or 55 rotate around the bead core 21, 41 or 51 and cause the carcass ply to be placed in tension.
