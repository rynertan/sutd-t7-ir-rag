# CASING SIZING MEANS AND METHOD

## Abstract
A casing sizing means which comprises a plurality of petal like sizing members arranged about a central hub to form generally the shape of a truncated cone. The sizing members are normally biased towards an outward or expanded position against the inner surface of the casing. As casing moves over these members during stuffing, the contacting sizing members are pulled upright to a casing stretching position and against a stop which prevents the members from moving beyond a predetermined casing sizing position.
