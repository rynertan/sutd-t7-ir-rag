## Description
LIQUID DOSING APPARATUSTHIS invention relates to a dosing apparatus.There are many situations where it is necessary to dose a liquid flowing in a pipeline with a controlled concentration of dosing liquid.Conventionally, this is commonly achieved with the aid of pumps of positive displacement or peristaltic type which inject the dosing liquid into the flow of liquid, or by means of a venturi throat in the pipeline.Both systems have disadvantages. In the case of pumps, there is a roquiromont for in Independent powen supply and for constant maintonance, while in the case of a venturi throat, the rate of flow in the pipeline must be high in order to achieve the necessary yacuum to draw dosing liquid into the main flow.Other known dosing systems make use of a pressure d,fSerential to expel a dosant liquid from a flexible bladder into a pipeline conveying the liquid which is to be dosed. Examples of systems of this kind are to be found in the following patent speclfications French patent 1.399,749 US patent 3,72 ,230 US patent 3,166,096 Swiss patent 362857 German patent specification 1 542 294 French patent 1.251.892 US patent 2,932,3 7 and US patent 3t974,847 The various apparatuses disclosed in the above mentioned specifications do, however, exhibit a number of disadvantages, of which the following are important the pressure differential is created in the pipeline by means of a fixed orifice and the shapes of the bladders and containers. are not conducive to equal pressure distnibution en the bledder. The use of a fixed orifice means that the apparatus is limited to use in a single application only, not being capable of adjustment to suit desired dosing rates in different applications. The results of using the container and bladder shapes disclosed in the specifications lead to non uniform collapse of the bladder under the pressure diferential and accordinc .y to inaccurate dosing.The present invention seeks to alleviate the proplems referred to above.For dosing liquid flowing in a pipeline with a dosant liquid, the invention provides an apparatus comprising a rigid, hollow, spherical vessel, a collapsible bladder inside the vessel for containing the dosant liquic, the bladder being spherical when fult, means for location in the pipeline for creating an adjustable pressure differential across the means when liquid fowls in the pipe ine. the pressure upstream of the means being greater than the pressure downstream of te as, a first conduit for placing the interior of the vesse outside the bladder n communication wt the pioeline upstream of the means, and a second conduit for placing the interior of the bladder in communication with the pipeline downstream of the means so that the pressure differential acts on the bladder to collapse it and expel its contents through the second conduit into the pipeline at a rate dependent on a chosen pressure differential created by the means.It is preferred that the bladder is adapted to collapse. when subjected to the pressure d.fferential, at a uniform rate In one embociment, the bladder comprises a series of panels which are seated together and which are eacn defined between curvi .lnear edges.There may be a valve outlet from the vessel for the escape of liquid from the vessel, the outlet being situated at a level above that of the operatively lowest point of the vesse . there may also be an air release valve communicating the interior of the vessel outside the bladder with the ambient atmosphere at a level near to the operatively uppermost in of the vesselPreferably, the means for crating the pressure differential in the pipeline includes a squeeze valve. Most preferably the squeeze valve includes a circular cross section tube of retliant material for connection into the plellne, aud a squeezing device for varying the flow area through the tube while maintaining the circular cross section of the tube. The invention also provides swimming pool chlorination apparatus fcr use with a swimming pool reticulation system In which water is pupped along a pipeline through a filter, the chlorination apparatus including a rigid, hollow, spherical vessel, a collapsible bladder inside the vessel for containing a chlorinating dosant liquid, the bladder being sperical when full, a first conduit for placing the interior of the vessel outside the bladder in communication with the pipeline upstream of the filter, and a second conduit for placIng the interior of the bladder in communication with the pipeline downstream of the filter so that the pressure differential created in the pipeline by the filter acts on the bladder to expel its contents into the pipeline downstream of te filter.An embodiment of the present invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the acccmpanying drawings in which Figure 1 shows a perspective view of a dosing apparatus according to the invention Figure 2 shows a cross sectional view of the apparatus seen in Figure 1 ,with the bladcer full of dosant liquid Figure 3 showt a porspective view of the bladder when partially full Figure 4 shows a typical valve useo in an apparatus of the invention Figure 5 shows a detail of the squeezing device used in the valve of Figure 4 Figure 6 shows a schematic view of apparatms of the invention in use in continuous dosing operations Figure 7 shows a schematic view of an alternative contInuous dosing apparatus Figure 8 shows schematically a solenoid valve for use in the apparatus of Figure 9 Figure 9 shows a schematic view of an automatic dosing apparatus and Figure 10 shows a schematic view of a swimming poot chlorinating system.In the various Figures, like numerals are used to designate like components.Referring firstly to Figure 1, an apparatus of the invention Includes a vessel 10 which is formed of rigid plastics material sucn as polypropylene and which has a spherical shape Three legs 11 are fcrmed integrally with tne vessel 10 to supoort it on a level surface.Some distance above its lowest pcint, the vessel 10 has an internally threaded outlet 12 into which is screwed a conduit leadqnc to a manually operable al valve 14 naving an opeating handle .6. Near to its highest point, the vessel 1 has a conventional, manually operable air release valve 18 which communicates wth h the interior of the vessel. A nipple 29 is screwed through the wall of the vessel 10 Er to its highest point and is of e conventional type suitable for concection of a f lexible pressure line 21 leading from a process pipeline 52 seeFigures 6,7 and 9 . At its highest point, the vessel 10 has an integral, externally threaded neck 22 onto which is screwed a cap 24 having an intenal 0 rin seal and a nipple 26 of the same type as the nipple 20. In use, the nipple 26 has connected to it a flexible line 28 see firs 6,7 and 9J leading to the pipeline 52.Inside the vessel 10, there is a flexible bladder 30 formed of laminatedPVC polyvinyl chloride . As seen in Figure 3, the bladder is composed of a series of panels 32 which are heat seamed to one another. Each panel is defined by edges of curvilinear shape and the bladder has patches 34,35 heat seamed to the panels 32 at the points of convergence of the edges. When the bladder is full it has a perfectly spherical shape. A space 38 surrounds the bladder when It is full in the vessel 10.Communicating with the interior of the bladder through the upper patch 34 is a spigot 40 to which is fixed a hollow plug 42 having an annular recess accommodating an 0 ring seal 44. The upper end of the plug has a lip t6 which seats on the upper edge of the neck 22 with a chamfered surface 48 of the lip bearing against the 0 rina seal 26 Figure 6 shows one application of the apparatus where continuous dosing of a liquid conveyed In a pipeline 52 by means of a dosant is to be carried out. At the start of operations, the badger 30 is filled with the dosant and the lines 21 and 28 are connected to the pipeline at points 54 and 56 upstream and downstream respectively of a manually operable valve 58.The direction of liquid flow in the pipeline is indicated In Figure 5 by the arrow 60.If the valve 58 is partially closed, a pressure differential is created across the valve, with the upstream pressure being highe than the downstream pressure. Pressure liquid flows through the line 21 anc f.lXs the space 38, exerting pressure on the bladder which gradually collapses it and expels its contents through the line 28 into the pIpelir. 52 downstream of the valve 58. The rate of dosing Is proportional to the pressure diffeential, so by correctly settling the valve 58, the user is able to control the dosing rate accurately. The fnction of the air release valve 18 is to permit air to escape from the space 38 when liquid first flows into the space through the line 21. lt is important for the vessel 1C and for the bladder when full to have spherical shapes, since in th. r way an equal pressure distribution can be obtained over the whole bladder surface, leading to uniformity in the rosin rate. It has also been found that the particular panel configuration use for the bladder is important for achieving a uniform rate of collapse of the bladder.In sorne applications, a manually operable gate valve or other conventional valve can be used for the valve 56. Hcwever, it is preferred to use a squeeze valve such as that seen in Figure 4. Tis valve includes a tube 62 of flexible material, such as silicon rubber.Two raced, integral nipples 64,66 communicate with the tube 62. An annular squeezing device 68 Is fitted about the tube 62 between the nipples 64 and 66. This device is seen in Figure 5 to include a single band 70 of stainless steel which is arranged to form two loops 72 and 74.A screw 76 is tinreadec through a nut 78 fixed to the outer loop anc bears on a plate 80 fixed to the inner loop. In the result, as the screw is threaced further and further through the nut, the inner loop gets s naller and smaller, at all times remdining circular in shape. Thus, the tore of the tube 62 beneath tne device 68 remains circular at all times, but is variaole in diameter. Since the circular shape of the let 52 is maintained as the clameter is varied, smooth laminar flow is also maintained, and hence there is a uniform pressure drop.In use of the squeeze valve 58 seen In Figure 4, the tube 62 is connected into the pipeline, and the lines 2 . and 28 are connected up to the nipples 64 anc 661 respectively. By By varying the ciameter of the flow passage by appoprioate manipulation of the screw 76, close control can be maintained over te dosing rate.Figure 7 shows another application of the apparatus where continuous dosing takes place. A squeeze valve 58 of the Figure 4 type is again uses to create the desired pressure differential. but there Is also a conventional needle valve 82 associated with a rotameter 83 In the pressure line 21. By appropriate secting of the needle valve, the flow rate in the pressure line can be controlled, and the rotameter enables an operator to determine the flow rate with accuracy. In other respects, the apparatus of Figure 7 is identical to that of Figure 6.Note that the rotameter will also give an immediate inition If flow in the pipeline 52 should cease for ary reason,There are a great number of situations in which continuous dosing may find application. One such application is in tre dosing of water with iodine for the treatment of a cow s teats before or after milking.Another is in the dosing of water with plant nutrients or fertilizers in the agricultural. Industry. Yet another is in the dosing of swimming pool water with the necessary chemicals, such as iodine.in each such case, the appropriate setting of the valve 58 will be made to achieve the correct dosing rate. On the basis of the known dosing nate and known initial volume of the bladdwr 30, an operator will be able to determine how long the apparatus can remsin in operation before the contents of the bladder will have to be eplenished. In practice, once bladden has been in use for some time and it is known that the desant supply Is almost gone, via 88 the is the bladder will be refilled through the plug 42 once the outlet 12 has been opened to permit liquid to escape frcri the space 38.There are also applncations in which Intermjttent dosing is uesirBble. Figure 9 illustrates one apparatus suitable for intermittent dosing. In this case, a tank 86 holding a large volume of dosant liquid is connected to the nipple 23 via a line 8 contro ied by a solenoid valve 90 which receives control signals fro a microprocessor 92. The microprocessor 92 also sends control signals to solenoic valves 94, 95 located in the lines 21 and 28 and a solenoici valve 98 controlling the outlet 2 from Whe vessel 10. A manually operable valve 58 of Figure 4 type IS used to set the pressure reduction In the pipeline 52. In operation. burins dosing, the valves 90 and UP are closed. When a cosing cycle is completed. all valves are closed When the bladder in the vessel iO requires replenisment, the valves 90 and 98 are opened and the other valves are closed. Water in the vessel 10 surroundinc the bladder can run out of the vessel, and replenishment of the bladder takes place through the line 88. In each situation, the opening and closing of the various valves is controlled in accordance with a predetermined sequence, by the microprocessor 92. Figure 8 Illustrates one form of solenoid valve suitable for use in this type of application. The solenoid valve has an armature 100 surrounded by a coil 102 which is energised or de energised in accordance with signals from the microprocessor 92. When the coil is energised, the armature is drawn into the coil against the force of a comoression spring 104 and,when it is de energised, the sprIng urges the armature out of the so so that a plate 106 at its end squeezes a flexible tube 108 connected into the relevan line dgainst a finec plate 110. The tube 108 is formed of silicon rubber, and the spring force is chosen so that it will be overcome if line pressure should be excessive.Noto that the valve 58 in Figure 9 could also he 9 solenoid or other valve which is adapted to be controlled automatically in accordance with the predetermined cycle.Figure 10 illustrates schematically a chlorinatOn system for a swimming pool 120. As is conventional, tne pool 2 has an cverflow weir 122 froln which water is drawn by a pump 124 driven by a motor 12E. From. the pump, the water is passed to a filter 128 after whicn it is returned to the pool. According to the invention, a chlorine dosing acparatus 130 is incorporated into the norma swimming pool water recirculation systemA pressure line 21 is connected to the process line 52 between the pump 124 and the filter 128, and proceeds to the vessel 10 of a dosing apparatus of the type described previously.The bladder 30 is filled hit sodium hypochlorite solution at the correct concertration. The pressure drop across the filter causes the dosant liquid to be expelled into the line 52 downstrEam of the filter 128 at a rate denending on the pressure drop and on the setting of a solenoid vave 130 Ir the lne 28.The setting of the solenoid valve .30 Is controlled by the microprccessor 132.In a typical swimming pool, the pump 124 is operated intermittently in accordance with a predetermined timing cycle. When the pump first starts up at the commencement of a new pumping cycle eg early In the morningl, the pump casing and line 52 will be empty. as somp time for the pump to prime and pressurise the system. The microprecessor therefore includes a first timer unit 134 which receives a start up signal from the rotor 126 and which keeps the valve 130 closed until a precetermined tirre interval, sufficient to allow priming and pressurisation to take place, has passed. The valve is then opened for dosing to commence.he microprocessor 132 also Includes a second, manually adjustable timer unit 135 which takes over control of the solenid valve to control opening and closing thereof in accordance with a predeermined sequence.In winter, the chlorine ecuirements of a swimming pool will be less than in summer. Typically, the winter requirement wll be half of the summer requlrement. The mitroprocessor therefore includes a control unit 138 which can be actuated at the start of winter to fa.ve the cosage.Some algal strains are aole to develop a resistance to chlorine over a period of time, and It then becomes necessary to use a she dose. he microprocessor therefore includes a further control unit 40 which can be actuated to hold the solenoid valve 130 fully cpen for e precietermined ceried sufficient to snock dose the pool.In the chlarination application of Figure B. the pladder SO shoulc de of a material which is resistant to chemical attack py the cosant. PVC is a suitable material. Also, it should be poss .ble for a small amount of reverse osmosis to take place between the interior of the bladder anc t e space 38, toinhibit algoe growth in the space 36. An imoortant feature of the vessel 10 is the fact that the outlet i2 is positioned some distance above the lowest level of the vessel. it will,In fact, be above the level of the bottom end of the bladder 30 when the bladder is collapsed. With the outlet 12 so positIoned, the vessel 10 will not be emptied completely during refilling operations, and the volume of liquid nomaining in the vessel will provide some suppert to the bladder as it is refilled. If, for some reason, there should be a line blockage In the pipeline downstream of the apparatus, the pressure will be constant tnrcugnout, and the apparatus will therefore cease its dosing function.An advantage of the inventIon over other types of dosing apparatus using venturis is the fact that it will dose efficiently even where there are very low liquid flow rates in the system supply line.
