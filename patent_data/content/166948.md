## Description
The present invention relates to an electro optical display of the type including at least one picture element and pixel element, respectively, according to the first part of claim 1. Such electro optical display has been described in FR A 2 537 316. The term element d image is the same as the term pixel element . Each of the three pixel elements of this prior art display comprise a single electrode. The term electro optical material complies with the term light influencing material and means any material which emits light or can be used to selectively very the intensity, phase, or polarization of light either being reflected from or transmitted through the material. Liquid crystal material is only one such material having these characteristics. It is an object of the present invention to reduce the complexity of the substrate which is a problem in case of the need of a large number of pixels in the display in order to make a high resolution display with acceptable contrast and speed. The invention is claimed in claim 1 and preferred embodiments are claimed in subclaims and will be described in more detail in the following specification. The inventional structure includes the subdivision of one pixel electrode into at least two spaced apart ones side by side. The present invention provides a display of the type having a structure in which all of the electronic circuitry, including isolation devices where utilized, is located at one electrode side of each pixel electrode combination. The structure includes the subdivision of one pixel electrode into at least two spaced apart side by side electrode segments on one plane opposite one common electrode on a second plane for each pixel. Light influencing material is disposed between the electrode segments and the common electrode. The segmented electrode can increase the operational frequency while decreasing the electronic complexity of the display. The address lines can be coupled to each segmented electrode by one or more isolation devices to provide more complete pixel isolation and to increase the manufacturing yield of the displays. The present invention provides a display including at least one pixel element. The pixel element is formed with a segmented electrode including at least a pair of spaced apart electrode segments, a common electrode spaced from the segmented electrode in substantially parallel relation thereto, with light influencing material between the segmented electrode and the common electrode. At least one isolation device can be coupled to the electrode segments and a pair of isolation devices preferably can be coupled to the electrode segments. The isolation devices can be diodes which can be formed from a deposited semiconductor material. The deposited semiconductor material is preferably an amorphous semiconductor alloy including silicon. The diodes preferably include a first doped semiconductor region, a substantially intrinsic semiconductor region overlying the first doped region, and a second doped semiconductor region opposite in conductivity with respect to the first doped region overlying the intrinsic region. The present invention further provides a display subassembly, which display includes at least one pixel element. The subassembly includes a substrate, a segmented electrode including at least a pair of spaced apart electrode segments formed on the substrate and at least one address line coupled to each of the electrode segments. The subassembly can include isolation devices coupling one or both lines to the electrode segments and formed on the same plane or substrate. The display subassembly can then have light influencing display material applied between at least the segmented electrode and the common electrode to form a completed display. Referring now to Fig. 1, a schematic diagram of a prior art liquid crystal display 10 is best illustrated. The liquid crystal display 10 includes a pair of pixels 12 and 14. The liquid crystal display 10 can include a first common x addressing line 16 which is coupled through the pixels 12 and 14 to respective y addressing lines 18 and 20. The x addressing line 16 is generally formed on one plane or substrate not illustrated and is coupled to a first electrode 22 and 24 of the pixels 12 and 14. The y addressing lines 18 and 20 are generally formed on a second plane or substrate not illustrated and are coupled to a respective second electrode 26 and 28. A liquid crystal display material 30 is applied between the electrodes 22 and 26, 24 and 28, which effectively forms a capacitor with the electrodes. The pixels 12 and 14 can also include separate x addressing lines. Referring now to Fig. 2, a schematic diagram of an improved light influencing display pixel 32 is best illustrated. The pixel 32 is fully disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 573,004, entitled Liquid Crystal Displays Operated By Amorphous Silicon Alloy Diodes , filed in the names of Zvi Yaniv, Vincent D. Cannella, Gregory L. Hansell and Louis D. Schwartz, on January 23, 1984, which is incorporated herein by reference. The pixel 32 includes a first x addressing line 34 which is coupled through the pixel to a y addressing line 36. The addressing line 34 is generally formed on one plane or substrate not illustrated and is coupled to a first electrode 38. The y addressing line 36 is generally formed on a second plane or substrate not illustrated and is coupled to a second electrode 40. A light influencing material, such as liquid crystal display material 42 is applied between the electrodes 38 and 40, which again effectively forms a capacitor. Again, as above mentioned, by the term light influencing material is meant any material which emits light or can be used to selectively vary the intensity, phase, or polarization of light either being reflected from or transmitted through the material. Liquid crystal material being one such material having these characteristics. The y addressing line 36 typically includes at least one dual polarity isolation device, such as a transistor not illustrated or a pair of single polarity isolation devices 44 and 46. Each of the devices 44 and 46 has a respective address line 48 and 50, respectively. The devices 44 and 46 are illustrated as diodes for simplicity, but can be any type of single polarity isolation device. Again, as above mentioned, by the term isolation device is meant any device which enhances the ability for one pixel to be addressed switched without switching other pixels on a common address line. It is known that the useful life of a nematic liquid crystal display material can be extended if the polarity of the applied voltage potential is periodically reversed, such as during alternate display frames. This can be accomplished, for example, with the pixel 32 by applying a positive potential on line 48 and a negative potential on line 34 during one frame or time period to forward bias the diode 44 and effectively charge the capacitor in one polarity. The next time period or frame, a positive potential is applied to the line 34 and a negative potential is applied to the line 50 to forward bias the diode 46. Repeating this sequence causes the potential applied to the capacitor and hence the liquid crystal display material 42 to be reversed during alternate frames. The switching speed or frequency is limited by the time it takes to charge the capacitor. The pixels 12, 14 and 32 require that electronic circuitry be formed on both planes which requires connectors to both planes on opposite sides of the liquid crystal display material. The operating frequency is limited by the capacitor formed by the pixel electrodes and the liquid crystal display material. Full isolation for the pixels can only be accomplished by adding isolation devices to the x addressing line 16 or 34, further complicating the circuitry on the second plane. Also, no redundancy is provided for the isolation devices 44 and 46 and if one is defective the pixel 32, and hence the display, will be defective. Although just one pixel element is illustrated in the Figs., it can be appreciated that many such pixels can be formed in for example, a row and column arrangement to provide a complete liquid crystal display of any size. Fig. 3 illustrates a first pixel embodiment 52 of the invention. The pixel 52 includes a common electrode 54 having at least one electrode segment on one plane not illustrated separated from a second segmented electrode 56 on a second plane not illustrated by a light influencing material, such as liquid crystal display material 58. The segmented electrode 56 is subdivided into at least a pair of spaced apart electrode segments 60 and 62 coupled to separate respective x and y address lines 64 and 66. The electrode segments 60 and 62 provide the pixel 52 with a number of advantages over the pixels 12, 14 and 32. All the electronic circuitry can be formed on the same plane with the electrode segments 60 and 62. The common electrode 54 on the opposite plane can merely be a floating electrode with no pixel addressing circuitry connected to it. Further, the electrode segments 60 and 62, the liquid crystal display material 58 and the common electrode 54 result in a capacitor with one quarter of the capacitance of the above described capacitors. Assuming the liquid crystal display material is the same, and the electrode spacing is the same, then the result is two capacitors, each equivalent to one half the prior capacitors, in series. These two capacitors in series result in one quarter the capacitance which requires twice the voltage, but one half the charge to obtain the same field. Thus, utilizing the same current, the frequency is doubled. If the liquid crystal display material 58 is a nematic liquid crystal display material, the applied voltage potential should be reversed periodically, such as the beginning of each frame. This can be accomplished by applying a positive potential on line 64 and a negative potential on line 66 in the first time frame. In the next time frame, a positive potential is applied to the line 66 and a negative potential to the line 64 to reverse the applied voltage potential. This sequence is repeated to enhance the lifetime of the liquid crystal display material. Fig. 4 illustrates a second pixel embodiment 68 of the invention with elements corresponding to the elements in the pixel 52 having the same numerals. The pixel 68 includes a pair of dual polarity isolation devices 70 and 72 coupled to respective address lines 64 and 66 and to address lines 74 and 76. Although one isolation device is illustrated coupled to each of the electrode segments 60 and 62, since the devices are dual polarity only one of the electrode segments needs to be coupled to an isolation device. The second isolation device adds redundancy to the pixel 68, since the pixel 68 will operate with one of the isolation devices shorted. The applied voltage potential can be reversed as previously described, by alternating the polarity of the one or two isolation devices along with the applied potentials. Fig. 5 illustrates another pixel embodiment 78 of the invention, again utilizing numerals corresponding to the pixel 52 where applicable. The electrode segment 60 and the addressing line 64 are coupled through a pair of isolation devices 80 and 82 which are coupled to separate respective lines 84 and 86. To reverse the polarity on the pixel 78, in one time frame a positive potential is applied to the line 84 and a negative potential to the line 66 to forward bias the diode 80. In the next frame, a positive potential is applied to the line 66 and a negative potential to the line 86 to forward bias the diode 82. Generally, the same polarity potential will be applied to both of the lines 84 and 86 in each time frame to reverse bias the other diode. Another pixel embodiment 88 is illustrated in Fig. 6. The corresponding numerals are again utilized without further description. The pixel 88 includes a second pair of isolation devices 90 and 92 coupled to the address line 66 and to respective address lines 94 and 96. The second pair of devices 90 and 92 add more complete isolation to the pixel 88 and also provide redundancy to the pixel 88. The pixel 88 and hence the display will operate with any one of the isolation devices 80, 82, 90 and 92 shorted. As will be discussed hereinafter, the most likely defect in the preferred type of isolation device is an electrical short. To reverse the polarity on the pixel 88, in one time frame a positive potential is applied to the line 84 and a negative potential is applied to the line 96 to forward bias the isolation devices 80 and 92. In the next frame, a positive potential is applied to the line 94 and a negative potential to the line 86 to forward bias the isolation devices 82 and 90. Again, the second devices can be reverse biased in each time frame. Referring to Fig. 7, a partially diagrammatic and partially schematic diagram of one embodiment of the pixel 88 is illustrated. The common electrode 54 is not illustrated, but would substantially overlie the areas of the electrode segments 60 and 62. Separate y line connections 64 are shown as well as separate x line connections 66 to the pixel electrode segments 60 and 62. Electrically these are equivalent to the schematic diagram in Fig. 3. Each of the lines 84, 86, 94 and 96 is isolated from one another. The pixel 88 is illustrated in top plan view in Fig. 8 and a side sectional view in Fig. 9 The cross sectional view in Fig. 9 is taken along the line 9 9 , 9 9 and 9 9 in Fig. 8. The pixel 88 is formed on an insulative substrate 98, such as glass. The electrode segments 60 and 62 are formed on the substrate 98 and can be formed of a transparent conductive layer 100, such as deposited indium tin oxide ITO . The lines or leads 86 and 96 are also formed on the substrate 98. The lines 86 and 96 can be formed from the ITO layer 100 and a top metal layer 102, or they can be formed from just a conductive material such as metal, for example, aluminum, molybdenum, or a molybdenum tantalum alloy. Other suitable metals are chromium, tantalum tungsten, palladium and platinum. The lines 86 and 96 can be formed by, for example, magnetron sputtering the metal over the entire surface area of the glass substrate 98 and then removing selected portions of the deposited metal by utilizing a mask and photolithography techniques of the types well known in the art. The isolation devices 80, 82, 90 and 92 then are formed, preferably from a deposited semiconductor material. The devices are formed as diodes for illustration purposes, but can be any of the above enumerated isolation devices. The deposited semiconductor material is preferably an amorphous semiconductor alloy including silicon. The amorphous silicon alloy can also include hydrogen and or fluorine and can be deposited by plasma assisted chemical vapor deposition i.e. glow discharge as disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 4,226,898 which issued on October 7, 1980 in the names of Stanford R. Ovshinsky and Arun Madan for Amorphous Semiconductors Equivalent To Crystalline Semiconductors Produced By A Glow Discharge Process. The diodes preferably have a p i n configuration, best illustrated in Fig. 9, formed by a first doped region 80a and 92a, which can be n type, an intrinsic region 80b and 92b overlying the first doped regions 80a and 92a respectively, and a second doped region 80c and 92c, which can be p type, overlying the intrinsic regions 80b and 92b respectively. The diodes also preferably include a top conductive layer 80d and 92d. More specifically, the diodes can be formed by depositing the previously mentioned conductive layer 100, metal layer 102, amorphous silicon alloy regions and top conductive layer over the entire surface area of the substrate 98, and thereafter selectively etching portions of the top metal layer and amorphous silicon alloy regions by utilizing a suitable mask and conventional photolithography techniques. The mask utilized during the etching process preferably defines a diode configuration wherein each diode is about 20 to 50 microns on a side. Representative thicknesses for the amorphous silicon alloy regions can be, for example, 300 to 1,000 Angstroms and preferably 500 Angstroms for the p type regions, 1,000 to 10,000 Angstroms and preferably 3,000 Angstroms for the intrinsic regions, and 100 to 500 Angstroms and preferably 200 Angstroms for the n type regions. Once the diodes are formed on the metal layer 102, the diode patterned resist is removed and new resist layers are coated and patterned to form the electrode segments 60 and 62 without the metal layer 102 and the bottom lines 86 and 96 with the metal layer 102. Alternately, the bottom lines 86 and 96 can first be formed of metal and then the diodes formed thereon. Thus, the diode 80 is formed on the electrode segment 60, the diode 90 on the electrode segment 62, the diode 92 on the line 96 and the diode 82 on the line 86. A layer of insulating material 104 is next formed over the lines 86 and 96, the substrate 98, the electrode segments 60 and 62, and the diodes 80, 82, 90 and 92. The insulating material 104 can be formed from any deposited insulator such as silicon oxide Si The top lines 64, 66, 84 and 94 are then formed coupling the lines, diodes and electrode segments together. The top lines can be formed of a conductive material of the same type as described for the lines 86 and 96. The conductive material for the top lines is generally chosen to be different than that of the bottom lines to obtain a differential etch. A top passivation layer 114 is then formed over the exposed surfaces, which layer is patterned to expose the electrode segments 60 and 62. The top passivation layer 114 can be formed of the same materials and in the same manner as the layer 104. This forms a completed subassembly of the display and pixel 88. The subassembly is an intermediate product in the manufacturing of the display. The subassembly can be stocked for later use or sold for completion into a display by another party. Further, as more fully described in copending application, entitled High Yield Liquid Crystal Display And Method Of Making Same , filed concurrently herewith, the subassembly can be electronically tested prior to adding the light influencing material since the electronic circuitry is all on the one substrate 98. Fig. 10 illustrates a cross sectional side view of the pixel 88 along the line 9 9 of Fig. 8 with a top plane 116, the common electrode 54 and the pixel liquid crystal display material 58. The pixel 88 in Fig. 10 is a completed display pixel. It must be appreciated that the structure illustrated in Figs. 8 10 is not drawn to scale and that the common electrode 54 and the electrode segments 60 and 62 define the light influencing display area of the pixel 54. The electrodes are substantially coextensive and can be configured in a square configuration as illustrated in Fig. 8 and can be, for example, 300 to 2,000 microns on a side depending on the overall size of the finished display matrix and the desired aspect ratio. The light influencing material 58 can be of any conventional variety, as for example nematic liquid crystal display material. As can be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the present invention can be practiced otherwise than as specifically disclosed herein. For example, the diodes of the displays can be formed from deposited semiconductor materials other than amorphous semiconductor alloys which need not be deposited materials. For example, the diodes can be formed from polycrystalline semiconductor alloys. Furthermore the amorphous semiconductor alloy material diodes can be formed from other material configurations than the p i n configuration described herein. For example, configurations such as p π n, p ν n, p n, Schottky, etc are possible where π and ν refer to lightly doped p and n type semiconductor material respectively. Also, if a high voltage threshold is desired for the pixels, the diodes can be formed in a stacked or tandem configuration. Further, as above mentioned, the isolation devices can be other than diodes, such as transistors or other dual polarity devices. If a further reduction in pixel capacitance is desired, the electrodes could be further subdivided. For example, the pixel common electrode could be divided into two electrode segments and the segmented electrode could be divided into three spaced apart electrode segments with the address lines coupled only to the two outer segmented electrode segments.
