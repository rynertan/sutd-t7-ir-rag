# Apparatus for reproducing a multichannel video signal incorporating differential gain and differential phase compensating circuits.

## Abstract
A method for recording a video signal having luminance and chrominance signals by using a plurality of rotary transducing heads on a recording tape moved longitudinally by a drive mechanism, in which the time axis of the video signal is extended as long as N times, the time axis expanded video signal is divided to N channels, and first and second pilot signals have a predetermined frequency are alternately inserted into a predetermined position of a horizontal blanking period of the devided video signal. In this case, the DC voltage level of the first and second pilot signals are selected near the white peak level and near the black level respectively. An apparatus for recording a video signal having luminance and chrominance signals on a recording tape is also disclosed which includes a circuit for expanding the time axis of the video signal, a divider for dividing the expanded video signal into a plurality of channel video signals, a circuit for producing first and second pilot signals having a predetermined frequency and DC voltage level, the DC voltage level of the first and second pilot signals being different each other and an adding circuit for adding said first and second pilot signals alternately in the horizontal blank ing period of the plurality of channel video signals respec tively.
