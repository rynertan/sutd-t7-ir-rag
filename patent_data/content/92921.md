# Amusement game.

## Abstract
An electromechanical amusement game apparatus in cluding a frame 12 , a playing surface 14 supported by the frame, at least one player element 46 movable by a manually operated mechanism 50 along an elongated track 44 in the playing surface, and a player piece 60 movable along and over the playing surface 14 in response to being engaged and propelled by the player element. A pair of the player elements 46 are in opposed relation in a single track 44 for movement therealong toward, in contact with, and away from each other in response to manipulation of the manually operated mechanism 50 . As a result, a person playing the game can manually force his player element 46 into contact with the player element 46 of another person playing the game in a manner physically interfering with each other similar to checking in hockey and contact in other sports. The game playing surface 14 is enclosed in a transparent hollow cover 34 which supports a scoreboard and clock simulating structure 40 in suspended relation over the playing surface 14 . The game includes timing and scorekeeping functions similar to those of an actual game being simulated, There are two scoring areas 62, 64 at opposite ends of the playing surface 14 for receiving the player piece 60 in a manner causing a score, score sensors 340, 341 in the areas for signalling a score and additional sensors 400, 402 adjacent each area for signaling a near miss. A sound generator 522 carried by the frame and operatively connected to all of the sensors provides sound of a first type in response to a score and sound of a second type in response to a near miss.
