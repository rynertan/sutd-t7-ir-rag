# Magnetic bubble memory component.

## Abstract
A magnetic bubble memory component in the form of a module 1 incorporating a magnetic bubble memory device 10 and analog peripheral circuits therefor 3, 4, 5, 6 mounted on substrate 2 which also carries lead terminals 7 . The module 1 can be mounted on a conventional printed circuit board in the manner of other electronic components such as IC s. Further, the module 1 enables a designer with no knowledge of analog circuitry to design memory apparatus utlising the module. Lead terminals 12 of the device 10 are protected by protection means 8 , of insulator such as plastics materials, so that charged bodies e.g. a human finger cannot contact those terminals 12 . Thereby the possibility of electrostatic charge damage to the device 10 is avoided, affording high reliability and high production yield for memory apparatus using the module 1 .
