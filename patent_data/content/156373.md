## Description
This invention is in the field of biochemical engineering. More particularly, the invention concerns a biochemical separation or recovery process in which interleukin 2 IL 2 is separated or recovered from microorganisms that have been transformed to produce IL 2. Native human IL 2 is an antigen nonspecific, genetically unrestricted soluble factor produced by erythrocyte rosette positive T cells stimulated with antigens, mitogens and alloantigens. It is a protein with a reported molecular weight in the approximate range of 13,000 to 17,000 daltons S. Gillis and J. Watson, IL 2 and IL 2 muteins in which the cysteine residue at amino acid 125 has been replaced with serine and or the initial alanine has been eliminated have been produced microbially through genetic engineering techniques. Microbially produced IL 2 is not glycosylated and is produced in a reduced state by the microorganisms. When purified and oxidized, these microbially produced IL 2s exhibit activity comparable to native human IL 2. Procedures for purifying native IL 2 from T cells are described by Watson, J., et al, U.S. Patent No. 4,450,103 issued May 22, 1984 and Derynck, R., et al, The present invention relates to a process for recovering IL 2 from a transformed microorganism containing the IL 2 comprising In preferred embodiments of this process the chaotropic agent is urea at a concentration of about 3.5 M to about 4.5 M in the extraction mixture, the solubilizing agent is sodium dodecyl sulfate SDS or sodium lauryl sarcosine sarcosyl , the solubilized IL 2 is further extracted with 2 butanol or 2 methyl 2 butanol and the final separation is carried out by gel filtration, the resulting sized product is oxidized and the oxidized product is purified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography RP HPLC . Figure 1 shows a flow diagram of two alternative embodiments of the invention process in which gel filtration chromatography is used as a final purification step. The embodiment designated Method 1A uses SDS as a solubilizing agent the embodiment designated Method 1B uses sarcosyl as a solubilizing agent. The figure includes densitometer scans of SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis SDS PAGE analyses of the product at various steps in the process. Figure 2 is an HPLC chromatogram and SDS PAGE analysis of the product of Example 3. Figure 3 is an HPLC chromatogram of the product of Example 9. Figure 4 is a flow diagram of a preferred procedure for processing microbially produced IL 2. As used herein the term IL 2 denotes an unglycosylated protein that is a produced by a microorganism that has been transformed with a human interleukln 2 gene or a modification of the human interleukin 2 gene that encodes a protein having a an amino acid sequence that is at least substantially identical to the amino acid sequence of native human interleukin 2 and b has biological activity that is common to native human interleukin 2. Substantial identity of amino acid sequences means the sequences are identical or differ by one or more amino acid alterations deletions, additions, substitutions that do not cause an adverse functional dissimilarity between the synthetic protein and native human interleukin 2. Examples of such proteins are the IL 2s described in European patent application 83101035.0 filed February 3, 1983 published October 19, 1983 under publication no. 91539 and European patent application 82307036.2 filed December 22, 1982 published September 14, 1983 under no. 88195 , the IL 2s described in European patent application 83306221.9 filed October 13, 1983 published May 30, 1984 under no. 109748 , and the IL 2s described in the examples of this application. As used herein the term transformed microorganism denotes a microorganism that has been genetically engineered to produce a protein that possesses native human interleukin 2 activity. Examples of transformed microorganisms are described in said European patent publications 88195, 91539, and 109748 and the examples of this application. Bacteria are preferred microorganisms for producing IL 2. Synthetic IL 2 may also be made by suitably transformed yeast and mammalian cells. The transformed microorganisms are grown in a suitable growth medium, typically to an optical density OD of at least about 30 at 680 nm, and preferably between about 20 and 40 at 680 nm. The composition of the growth medium will depend upon the particular microorganism involved. The medium is an aqueous medium containing compounds that fulfill the nutritional requirements of the microorganism. Growth media will typically contain assimilable sources of carbon and nitrogen, energy sources, magnesium, potassium and sodium ions, and optionally amino acids and purine and pyrimidine bases. See After the cells are harvested from the culture, they may be concentrated, if necessary, to about 20 to 150 mg ml, preferably 80 to 100 mg ml OD 40 to 300, preferably 160 to 200 at 680 nm by filtration, centrifugation, or other conventional methods. Following concentration the cell membranes of the microorganisms are disrupted. The main purpose of disruption is to facilitate the following extraction and solubilization steps. Conventional cell disruption techniques such as homogenization, sonication, or pressure cycling may be used in this step of the process. Preferred methods are sonication or homogenization with a Manton Gaulin homogenizer. The end point of the disruption step may be monitored by optical density, with the optical density of the suspension typically decreasing about 65 to 85 . In any event, the disruption should break substantially all of the cells so that substantially no intact cells are carried through to the solubilization step. Before the disruption, the pH of the liquid phase of the concentrate is adjusted, if necessary, to a level that facilitates removal of The steps in the recovery process subsequent to the disruption step are primarily designed to separate the IL 2 from After the cells have been disrupted the particulate matter may be separated from the liquid phase of the disruptate and resuspended in an aqueous medium buffered to the optimal pH for the extraction. The particulate matter may optionally be washed with buffer at this stage to remove any water soluble The extraction of Following the extraction, the mixture is separated into solid and liquid phases. The IL 2 in the solid phase is then selectively solubilized by contacting the solid phase with a neutral, aqueous buffer containing a reducing agent and a solubilizing agent. Surface active agents detergents that have a suitable hydrophobic hydrophilic balance to solubilize the hydrophobic IL 2 may be used. Alkali metal sulfates containing 10 to 14 carbon atoms and alkali metal alkyl sarcosinates are preferred solubilizing agents, with SDS and sarcosyl being particularly preferred. The amount of solubilizing agent used in the solubilization will depend upon the particular agent. When SDS or sarcosyl are used, the preferred ratio w w of SDS sarcosyl to solid phase protein is about 0.5 1 to 1.4 1. The solubilizing medium also contains a sufficient amount of reducing agent to prevent the solubilized IL 2 from undergoing oxidation to any significant degree. Protein reducing agents such as dithiothreitol DTT and 2 mercaptoethanol may be used. The concentration of reducing agent such as DTT in the medium will usually range between about 5 to 20 mM. The solubilization will typically be carried out at temperatures in the range of 20 C to 25 C with mixing to facilitate contact between the solid phase and the solubilizing medium. Higher temperatures may solubilize unwanted After the IL 2 is solubilized the IL 2 may optionally be extracted from the aqueous solution under reducing conditions with 2 butanol or 2 methyl 2 butanol to remove additional The next step in the process is to separate the IL 2 and any RP HPLC is an alternative to gel filtration. Also, RP HPLC is capable of removing molecules from the solution that have molecular weights close to IL 2 and cannot, therefore, be removed completely by gel filtration. In addition, contaminants such as bacterial endotoxin are also removed effectively by RP HPLC. Therefore, RP HPLC may also be used as a final purification step after gel filtration. Supports stationary phases that provide good resolution of proteins may be used in the RP HPLC. C 4, C 8, or C 18 on 300 angstrom pore size supports are examples of preferred supports. The separation is carried out at an acidic pH of less than about 2.3, usually 2.1 to 2.3, in order to keep the IL 2 in solution. In this regard, the pH of the solution from the solubilization gel filtration will preferably be adjusted to this range. The solution is loaded into the RP HPLC column and is adsorbed onto the stationary phase. A gradient solvent system comprising an organic acid such as acetic acid or trifluoroacetic acid and organic solvent such as propanol or acetonitrile is used to elute the IL 2 from the column. Acetic acid propanol, trifluoroacetic acid propanol, and trifluoroacetic acid acetonitrile are preferred solvent systems. IL 2 elutes in the acetic acid propanol system at about 40 propanol, in the trifluoroacetic acid propanol system at about 50 propanol, and in the trifluoroacetic acid acetonitrile system at about 62 acetonitrile. For convenience, the organic solvent content of the elutant will usually be increased rapidly to a level somewhat below the solvent concentration at which the IL 2 elutes followed by a slow gradient change in the range of about 0.1 to 1.0 min. As soon as the IL 2 is recovered from the chromatography step, it is lyophilized and resuspended in a neutral aqueous buffer containing the reducing agent to keep the IL 2 in a reduced state and the solubilizing agent to keep it in solution . The IL 2 is stable in this form and may be stored for further treatment and formulation before being used. An alternative and preferred procedure is to oxidize the IL 2 after it has been separated by gel filtration and purify the oxidized product by RP HPLC or gel filtration followed by RP HPLC. This results in efficient removal of contaminants surviving the gel filtration as well as unwanted oxidation products. A preferred oxidation procedure is to oxidize a fully reduced microbially produced synthetic protein having an amino acid sequence substantially identical to a useful protein which sequence includes cysteines which in the useful protein are linked intramolecularly to form a cystine in a controlled manner so that the cysteines are oxidized selectively to form the cystine. In this process the fully reduced microbially produced synthetic protein is reacted with o iodosobenzoate, which oxidizes cysteines selectively in an aqueous medium, at a pH at least about one half pH unit below the pK The purity of the IL 2 after the chromatography step s is at least about 95 and usually at least about 98 . This highly pure material contains less than about 5 ng endotoxin, usually less than about 0.01 ng endotoxin per 100,000 Units Il 2 activity. The invention process is further described by the following examples. These examples are not intended to limit the invention in any manner. IL 2 was recovered from The Dow Corning Antifoam B, 20 solution, glucose, 50 solution, and KOH, 5N, were added on demand. The pH of the fermenter was maintained at 6.8 with 5 N KOH. Residual glucose was maintained between 5 10 g l, dissolved oxygen at 40 , and temperature at 37 1 C. The casamino acids 20 stock solution were added when the OD₆₈₀ was about 10. Harvest was made three hours after the OD₆₈₀ reached about 20. The harvested material was concentrated by hollow fiber filtration and or centrifugation. Twenty to forty g wet weight of the concentrate were resuspended in 200 ml of 50 mM Tris, 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid EDTA pH 8.1 8.5 Tris EDTA buffer . The suspension was centrifuged at 3,000 4,000 x g for 10 minutes, the supernatant was removed, and the solids were resuspended in 200 ml Tris EDTA buffer at 4 C. The suspension was loaded into a sonicator Heat Systems, Model W 375 and sonicated at 4 C for 45 minutes end point OD₆₈₀ reduction of about 85 using large probe, pulsing with 50 duty on power setting 9 . An alternative disruption technique is to pass the suspension three times through a Manton Gaulin homogenizer on M 1 setting. Cellular debris was separated from the disruptate by centrifuging at 4,500 x g for 10 minutes. The cellular debris was resuspended in 60 ml Tris EDTA buffer at room temperature and an equal volume of 8 M urea Schwarz Mann ultrapure in Tris EDTA buffer was added to the suspension over five mintues with rapid stirring final urea concentration, 4 M . After continued slow stirring for 15 30 minutes, the suspension was centrifuged at 12,000 x g for 15 minutes to recover extracted cellular debris. If a solid phase does not form, the supernatant is withdrawn, an equal volume of Tris EDTA buffer is added and the mixture is recentrifuged. IL 2 was separated from the solution by gel filtration chromatography as follows. The solution was loaded onto a 2.6 cm x 100 cm S 200 column run in 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 6.8 , 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 1 SDS. The column effluent was collected in 4 ml fractions with samples of the fractions analyzed in 15 SDS PAGE minigels stained with Coomassie blue. The fractions containing the fewest contaminants minimizing contaminants at about 35K daltons, 16 18K daltons, and 12K daltons were pooled and concentrated to 5 10 ml by ultrafiltration Amicon YM5 ultrafilter . The concentrate was loaded onto a 2.6 cm x 100 cm G 100 column, run as above except that the SDS concentration was 0.1 rather than 1 . Fractions were analyzed by SDS PAGE and the purest fractions were pooled. The drawing shows a densitometer scan of the chromatographed product. Analysis indicated the product was 98 pure and contained 0.5 ng endotoxin 100,000 units of IL 2 activity as measured by the limulus amebocyte lysate assay Associates of Cape Cod, Inc., Woods Hole, MA . The N terminal amino acid sequence of this IL 2 is the same as the native human molecule except that the initial N terminal alanine is missing. The procedure of Example 1 was repeated using 2 sarcosyl instead of 2 SDS as a solubilizing agent and using sarcosyl in place of SDS in the chromatography columns. Figure 1 shows the densitometer scan for this crude extract using sarcosyl as a solubilizing agent crude extract of Method 1B . As indicated, the use of sarcosyl in place of SDS gave improved purity 58 vs 37 at similar IL 2 yield 50 vs 60 . The procedure of Example 1 was repeated through the steps preceding urea extraction and was then solubilized and clarified as described. The IL 2 was separated from the solution by RP HPLC as follows. The solution was diluted 10 fold in 0.1 trifluoroacetic acid TFA and was applied to a 4.6 mm I.D. x 5 cm L. Brownlee Aquaport RP 300 column equilibrated in 0.1 TFA. The IL 2 was eluted with a gradient of 30 60 acetonitrile containing 0.1 TFA over 45 minutes. The yield of IL 2 activity following HPLC was 80 100 . Figure 2 shows a silver stained SDS PAGE analysis of this product. The procedure of Example 1 was repeated through the steps preceding gel filtration chromatography. The soluble, clarified, reduced material was subjected to G 100 chromatography in 0.1 SDS as described in Example 1. The pooled peak fractions of IL 2 were further purified by RP HPLC as described in Example 3. The resulting purified, reduced IL 2 was oxidized and subjected to RP HPLC as described in Example 3. The procedure of Example 1 was repeated through the steps preceding the G 100 column. The procedure for Example 3 was repeated using a solvent system of propanol in 1 M acetic acid. The IL 2 was eluted with a gradient of 35 60 propanol over 200 minutes. Column dimensions were either 10 mm ID x 30 cm L or 48 mm ID x 50 cm L, and the column was packed with a bonded phase wide pore silica gel. The bonded phase wide pore silica used was Vydac TP214. The purity and yield of product was comparable to that of Example 3. The procedure of Example 3 was repeated using a solvent system of propanol in 0.1 TFA. The IL 2 was eluted with a gradient of 35 60 propanol over 120 minutes. The column and support materials were the same as in Example 5. The purity and yield of product were comparable to that of Example 3. The procedure of Example 1 was repeated except that the The procedure of Example 1 was repeated except that the IL 2 was recovered from Des Ala Ser₁₂₅ IL 2 producing The 5 SDS solution was diluted to 2 SDS with 0.1 M Na₂PO₄, pH 8.0. The protein concentration was determined, the pH was adjusted to 8.5, and DTT to 50 mM and EDTA to 2 mM were added. The mixture was heated to 40 C under N₂ to reduce the IL 2. The mixture was then cooled and the pH was adjusted to 5.0. The solution was then extracted at a 1 1 ratio v v with 2 butanol containing 1 mM DTT at room temperature. Residence time was 2 2.5 minutes. The extraction was carried out in a liquid liquid phase separator using a flow rate of 200 ml min. The organic extract was separated and its pH was adjusted to 8.0 with NaOH. The extract was then added slowly to 0.1 SDS in 10 mM Na₂PO₄, 2 mM DTT, pH 6 and stirred for 15 20 minutes. The resulting precipitate was separated and the resulting paste was resuspended in 5 SDS in PBS. The solution was clarified by centrifugation and reduced as above. Following reduction the solution was adjusted to pH 5.5 with acetic acid. The solution was purified by gel filtration using S 200 and G 25 columns. The resulting purified, reduced IL 2 was oxidized, and the oxidized product was purified by G 25 chromatography followed by RP HPLC as in Example 3. The resulting purified recombinant IL 2 product has an IL 2 content greater than about 95 as determined by reducing SDS PAGE analysis, an endotoxin content of less than about 0.1 nanograms mg of IL 2, and it is substantially free of pyrogens as determined by the U.S. P. rabbit pyrogen test at a dosage of 3.3 x 10⁵ U kg. As previously indicated, the endotoxin content is less than about 5 nanograms, and preferably less than 0.01 nanograms endotoxin per 100,000 units IL 2 activity. Typically, the purified recombinant IL 2 products purified by the process of the invention have an IL 2 content greater than 98 as determined by reducing SDS PAGE or RP HPLC, as shown in Figure 3 in addition to being substantially free of endotoxins and pyrogens as indicated above. A variation of the process described in Example 9, such as might be used to produce IL 2 on a larger scale, is shown in Figure 4. The process shown in Figure 4 differs from that described in Example 9 as regards 1 minor changes in the buffers, 2 use of an acetic acid propanol Example 5 solvent system in the RP HPLC, and 3 the inclusion of post oxidation dilution diafiltration S 200 gel filtration, and ultrafiltration steps. The process as shown in Figure 4 may be modified with various refinements, for example, following the second S 200 column pass, in 1 SDS, the IL 2 solution is diluted 1 10 to give a 0.1 SDS concentration and then diafiltered against 10 mM phosphate buffer at a pH of 7.5 and 5 ppm SDS. The solution is then concentrated as required for appropriate use dosage.
