# A digital burst signal transmission system.

## Abstract
The digital burst signal transmission system pro vides for a low code error rate and high transmission efficiency. It is particularly suited for MD TDM and for TDMA communication systems. The transmission system comprises a first means 62 for generating a first burst control signal 83 , e.g. synchronized with an input digital signal, and a second burst control signal 84 , for example having a pulse width larger than that of said first burst control signal. A second means 54 gates the input digital signal 70 in response to said first burst control signal 83 to provide a step wise digital burst signal 73 , frequency limited by a third means 55 . A fourth means 59 gates the frequency limited digital burst signal 74 in response to said second burst control signal 84 , thereby providing the desired digital burst signal 77 .
