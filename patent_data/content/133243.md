# LAMINATED ARTICLE AND PRODUCTION THEREOF

## Abstract
Disclosed is an adhesive for bonding an ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer and polystyrene, which comprises a modified ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer obtained by graft copolymerizing a styrenic vinyl monomer and an α,β unsaturated carboxylic acid to an ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer. A laminated article having the said adhesive as an interlayer and production thereof are also disclosed. The laminated article shows strong resistance to delamination and excels in processability. Therefore, the laminate is valuable as a deep draw forming material with enhanced gas barrier properties for a preservation rigid container for foods.
