# Friction engaging drives with ceramic materials.

## Abstract
A friction energizing drive such as a clutch disc in a friction clutch for automotive clutches, starting clutches for continuously variable transmissions and heavy duty clutches for heavy equip ment or off the road vehicles, wherein a ceramic material in the form of discs or buttons 24 comprise the friction material. To smooth the generally abrupt torque curve and reduce the harsh feel of a ceramic material clutch, the ceramic material in the form of circular members, alone or secured to disc backings, are rotatably mounted on rivets 23 fixed on an annular clutch disc or plate 13 located between a flywheel and pressure plate in a clutch assembly.
