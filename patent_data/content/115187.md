## Description
The present invention relates to a semiconductor memory device, more particularly to a semiconductor memory device of reduced power consumption. As is well known, a semiconductor memory device includes a plurality of memory cells arranged in a matrix form, a decoder circuit, a multiplexer circuit, a group of word lines connected to the decoder circuit to activate one of the rows of the matrix, and a group of bit lines connected to the multiplexer circuit to activate one of the columns of the matrix. When a memory system requires a memory capacity over that of a single memory device, two or more memory devices are provided in parallel. The conventional technique for reducing power consumption of a memory system is to provide a switching circuit outside each memory device. The switching circuit is connected to the power supply terminal of the memory device. Using the switching circuit, it is possible to supply power only to the memory device which is to be accessed, i.e., power is not supplied to other memory devices. This method, however, is disadvantageous in that the switching time for the switching circuit outside of the memory device increases the memory access time. Also, this method is rapidly losing its effectiveness in the face of the recent increases in memory capacities of individual memory devices, now 64K bits or 128K bits, and the resultant increases in the size of the memory devices. It is no longer sufficient to reduce the power consumption by switching off power to non accessed memory circuits.

By applying to the second gate circuit or multi emitter transistor the part of the address signal which is fed to the corresponding first stage decoding element a significant increase in the speed of operation of the device is achieved. The device also has a reduced power consumption over conventional devices. Some examples of semiconductor memory devices in accordance with the present invention will now be described and contrasted with a prior art device with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Before describing a preferred embodiment of the present invention, an explanation will be given of the prior art for reference. Figure 1 shows a prior art circuit of a memory system including two integrated semiconductor circuit IC memory devices provided in parallel. In Figure 1, the IC memory devices la,lb have, for example, 32K bits capacities and are arranged in parallel through the line 4. This memory system therefore has a 64K bit capacity. When the input terminals at the IC memory devices la and or lb receive an external address signal SAe, consisting of A In order to reduce the power consumption, the memory devices la and lb are externally provided with power switching circuits 5a and 5b. A switching signal SW Resistors Rla and Rlb are bias resistors. Figure 2 shows the connection of the power switching circuits 5a and 5b and decoder circuits lla and llb, represented as logic gates. The IC memory devices la and lb include memory cells and control circuits. However, only address converter circuits CNV Generally, the power consumption of the decoder circuit of a memory is approximately one third to one half of the total power consumption of the memory device. In the prior art memory system comprising two stage decoder circuits, i.e., a first stage consisting of the power switching circuits 5a and 5b externally installed to the memory devices la and lb and a second stage consisting of the decoder circuits lla and llb in the memory devices la and lb, only one of the decoder circuits lla and llb operates at one time. This means the power consumption caused by the decoder circuits lla and llb is reduced by half. As mentioned earlier, however, there are disadvantages in that the power consumption cannot be reduced if the two memory devices are accessed at the same time that the access time increases due to the operation time of the power switching transistors 8a and 8b and the requisite decoder circuit stabilizing time and that the arrangement of the switching circuit externally to the memory device does not give sufficient power reduction for recent large memory devices. Figure 3 is a block diagram of a memory device, for example, an IC memory device which shows the general arrangement of devices in accordance with the present invention and the prior art. In Fig. 3, the memory device includes a decoder circuit 9 consisting of a first stage decoder 9l and a second stage decoder 92, a plurality of semiconductor memory cells MCa storing information, a group of word lines connected to the second stage decoder 92, and a group of bit lines connected to a multiplexer not shown . The first stage decoder 9l consists of a plurality of AND gates G Each set of a first stage decoder gate and a corresponding group of second stage decoder gates, for example, the gate G In the decoder circuit 9 shown in Fig. 3, the gate G Figure 4 shows a circuit for converting from the external address signal SAe to the internal address signal SAi connected to the first and second stage decoder gates. In this example, the external address signal SAe consists of three binary bits, i.e., X0 representing 2⁰, Xl representing 2 In order to convert the external address signal SAe to the internal address signal SAi, two series inverters I0l and I02 are provided on the X0 bit line, Ill and Il2 on the Xl bit line, and I2l and I22 on the X2 bit line. Thus, inverted signals In this example, the first stage decoder 9l has two m 2 gates, and the second stage decoder 92 has eight n 4 x 2 gates. Therefore, the internal address signal SAi, which can be generated by the combination of any inverted and reinverted signals, is connected to gates G As can be understood from the above in general, the higher bits SA In the embodiment shown in Figs. 3 and 4, only one set of a first stage decoder gate and corresponding second stage decoder gates, for example, the set of gate G Figure 5 shows the relationship between the number of gates in the first stage decoder 9l horizontal axis and the power consumption of decoder circuit 9 vertical axis . The curve shows the minimum power consumption is achieved with l0 gates. This will be explained later in detail. Figure 6 is detailed circuit diagram of an example of the first stage decoder gate G In this embodiment, the gate Gl The word line activation signal SWL is output at the terminal l6 connected to the collector of the transistor l4. In this embodiment, the higher bits SA Comparing the gate G The above mentioned merits also apply to the npn type transistors l2 to l4 in the gate Gl The operation of the circuit shown in Fig. 6 will be described below. When all of the higher bits SA When the transistor 8 is kept in the on state, however, one of the lower bits SA When the transistor 8 in the gate G As can be understood from the above explanation, when the gate of the first stage decoder is not in operation, the power consumption of the set of the first stage decoder gate and the corresponding second stage decoder gates is almost zero. Only one set of a first stage decoder gate and corresponding second stage decoder gates in the memory device is powered upon an access command. In addition, when one set is activated, only the first stage decoder gate and one of the second stage decoder gates are powered. The other second stage decoder gates are not powered. This means a considerable reduction in the power consumption of the decoder circuit. In the circuit in Fig. 6, use of Schottky barrier diodes for the diodes 7 The above AND circuits consisting of the diodes 7 Now, in the circuit in Fig. 6, the higher bits of the internal address signal applied to the diodes 7 Figure 7 shows a first embodiment of the present invention in which this situation is improved. The circuit shown in Fig. 7 has an additional AND portion l In accordance with the circuit shown in Fig. 7, the charge stored in the stray capacitance C Figure 8 shows another embodiment of the decoder circuit. In this circuit, the operation time of the decoder circuit is improved by using the transistor transistor logic TTL technology. The first stage decoder gate G The basic principle of operation of this circuit is similar to that of the circuit shown in Fig. 7. Accordingly, the explanation of this circuit operation is omitted. Determination of the number of gates of the first stage and second stage decoders for the minimum power consumption of the decoder circuit will be explained below with reference to the circuit shown in Fig. 3. First, the number m of gates of the first stage decoder 9l for minimizing the current of the second stage decoder gates GX The overall decoder driver circuit current IDD is defined as follows where, The currents I Rewriting the notations 2 Rewriting the above equation, one obtains The currents I Differentiating equation 2 by M, one obtains Further differentiating equation 3 by M, one obtains As I From equations 3 and 5 , the following equation is derived Rewriting this to the original form, one obtains The optimum number m of gates of the first stage decoder can be obtained from equation 6 . As the number m must be an integer, the optimum number of gates of the first stage decoder is determined as the integer nearest to the value given by equation 6 . The current consumption of the decoder circuit under the optimum number m can be obtained by equation l . The actual current of the circuit shown in Fig. 9, which is similar to that of Fig. 7, is calculated as an example. In Fig. 9, reference numerals 20 and 2l represent address inverter transistors for pulling the address signal of the first stage and second stage decoders into the ground. Reference numerals 22 and 23 are diodes connected between the resistors R₃ and R₅ and the power line Vcc. In this example, the currents IR The possible combinations of selection of the gates of the first stage and second stage decoders are shown in Table 2. In case l of Table 2, the transistor 8 in Fig. 9 is turned on, whereby the current I Next, in case 2 of Table 2, the transistor 8 shown in Fig. 9 is turned on, the transistor 2l is turned off, and the transistor 20 is turned on. Accordingly, almost all of the current I Finally, in case 3 of Table 2, the transistors 8, l2, and l4 are turned off, however, the transistor 20 and 2l are tuned on. Accordingly, the current I In order to obtain the opitimum number m of gates of the first stage decoder for the number n of gates of the second stage decoder, the currents I In order to obtain the minimum current consumption IDD of the decoder circuit, the optimum number m given by the above process is substituted into equation l . Table 6 represents the current consumption IDD of the decoder circuit in accordance with the above condition. By way of reference in evaluating the present invention, the current consumption of a prior art decoder circuit is shown in Table 7. The current consumption of the prior art decoder circuit is calculated using a circuit similar to that shown in Fig. 9. The circuit is constructed as a single chip. Figure l0 shows current consumption IDD curves depending on the number m of gates of the first stage decoder and the number n of gates of the second stage decoder under a power Vcc of 5.0V. From the curves shown in Fig. l0, the optimum combination of m and n can be obtained. As can be clearly understood from Tables 6 and 7, a decoder circuit of a two stage construction as in the present invention can significantly reduce the power consumption of the decoder circuit compared with the prior art decoder circuit. For example, when the decoder circuit in accordance with the present invention is used in a one chip programmable read only memory device of 64K bits and there are three gates of the first stage decoder and eight gates of the second stage decoder, the current consumption is l5 mA. On the other hand, the prior art decoder circuit consumes 68 mA under the same conditions. While the above embodiments were described with reference to the memory system shown in Figs. l and 2, the essence of the present invention is to form a two stage decoder circuit. The external switching circuits shown in Figures 1 and 2 can also be applied to a memory system including a plurality of memory devices in accordance with the present invention. In addition, a decoder circuit in accordance with the present invention may be constructed with three or more stages in consideration of the power consumption and the complexity of the circuit. Thus the present invention provides a semiconductor memory device of considerably reduced power consumption and improved operation time. In addition, the manufacturing process of the semiconductor memory device including npn transistors becomes simple.
