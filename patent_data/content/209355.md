# High level microbial production of bovine growth hormone.

## Abstract
A high density fermentation process for high yield produc tion of a protein having bovine growth hormone activity by transformant E. coli strains is described. The process employs transformant strains of E. coli containing a gene coding for a protein having bovine growth hormone activity under the con trol of a bacteriophage lambda promoter operator and a gene coding for the λcl857 temperature sensitive repressor protein. In the initial growth period, the level of dissolved oxygen in the fermentation medium is maintained at about 20 to 60 saturation and the temperature of the medium is maitained at a temperature at which the λcl857 repressor protein is active. Production of the desired protein is then induced by raising the temperature of the medium to at least about 42 C. The temperature is then reduced to about 38 C to 41 C to op timize cell growth for the remainder of the induction period, during which the level of dissolved oxygen in the medium is maintained at about 10 to 40 saturation, and the protein having bovine growth hormone activity thus produced is recovered from the transformant cells.
