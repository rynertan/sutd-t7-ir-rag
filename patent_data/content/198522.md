## Description
HETEROCYCLIC HERBICIDES This invention relates to certain imidazolinyl benzoic acids, the preparation of such compounds, herbicidal ccoositions containing then, and to their use in controlling undesired plant growth. UK Patent Application No. 2004537 and European Patent Application 41623 describes imidazolinyl benzoic and nicotinic acids, and their use as herbicides. It has now been found that useful herbicidal activity is present in certain methylenedioxy derivatives of such comounds. Accordingly, the present invention provides methylenedioxy imidazolinyl acids of the general formula I EMI1.1 wherein W represents CH or N n represents zero or 1 when W is N, and represents zero when W is CH one of X and Y represents a carbonyl group and the other represents the alkylidene group CR4R5 RI and R2, which may be the same or different, each independently represents a hydrogen atan, or an optionally substituted alkyl or cycloalkyl group R3 represents a hydrogen atan or a salt forming cation, or an optically halogenated alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, alkoxyalkyl, cycloalkyl, phenyl, furyl, or benzyl group R4 represents an alkyl or cycloalkyl group R5 represents an optically substituted alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl, phenyl, halophenyl or benzyl group or R4, R5 and the interjacent carbon atom, together represent a cycloalkyl group and Q represents a hydrogen atan or an acyl group. The term acyl is used to denote the radical derived fran an organic acid by the removal of a hydroxyl group the organic acid may be a carboxylic acid including carbamic acid derivatives or a sulphonic acid, exales of suitable acyl group being groups of the formula COR6 or SOR6 wherein R6 represents a hydrogen atan or an alkyl, haloalkyl, cycioaIkyl, alkoxyalkyl, alkoxy, alkylthio, alkylamino, or phenylamino group, or a phenyl or furyl group optionally substituted by a halogen atan or an alkyl, haloalkyl or nitro group. When any of the above substituents contains an alkyl, allanyl or alkynyl substituent group, this may be linear or branched and may contain up to 10, preferably up to 6, carbon arans, suitable examples being methyl, ethyl and propyl, and in the case of an alkyl group may also be substituted by a halogen, especially chlorine, atan or an alkoxy group such as a methoxy groups When they contain a cycloalkyl stbstituent group this may contain fran 3 to 10, preferably 3 to 8, carbon atans, and is suitably cyclopropyl.When any of the foregoing substituents are designated as being optionally substituted, the substituent groups which are optionally present may be any of those customarily employed in the development of pesticidal compounds, and or the modification of such copponds to influence their structure activity, persistence, penetration or other property.Specific examples of such substituents include halogen, especially fluorine, chlorine or bromine, atoms, and nitro, cyano, hydroxyl, alkyl, haloalkyl, and alkoxy groups in the case of halogen substituted alkyl groups, a particular preferred example is trifluoromethyl. When R3 represents a salt forming cation, this may be derived from any suitable base convenient cation species including alkali metal atans and ammonium or alkylamonium. Preferred compounds are those wherein R1 and R2 each represents a hydrogen atom n represents 1 when W is N X represents the alkylidene group CR4Rs in which R4 and R5 each independently represents an alkyl group of 1 6 carbon atans, in particular in which R4 is methyl and R5 is isopropyl Y represents a CO group Q represents a hydrogen atan or an acyl group of formula COR6 in which R6 represents an alkyl group of 1 6 carbon atans, especially a methyl group and R3 represents a hydrogen atari, an alkyl group of 1 6 carbon atans, especially methyl, an alkali metal cation such as sodium, or an alkylammonium cation in which the alkyl group or groups contain s 1 6 carbon atoms. The invention also provides processes for the preparation of methylenedioxy imidazolinyl acids as defined above the precise sequence of process steps depends upon whether W is N or CH.For those compounds wherein W is CH, the process comprises reacting a phthalic anhydride derivative of formula IIEMI3.1 with a 2 amino arnide of formula IIIEMI3.2 wherein the substituents are as defined for formula I above, and cyclising the intermediate product by treatment with a base.This reaction is conveniently carried out in organic solvent, preferably polar, such as acetonitrile, and the subsequent cyclisation to the desired imidazole is suitably effected with an alkali metal, preferably sodium, hydroxide. For those compounds wherein W is N, the process comprises reacting a benzoxazole of formula IVEMI4.1 with a maleimide of formula V EMI4.2 followed by hydrolysis in the presence of a strong acid and cyclo dehydration. The hydrolysis is conveniently effected by a strong mineral acid, such as concentrated sulphuric acid, and the cyclo dehydration is suitably effected by contact with a hydride, such as an alkali metal hydride, in an organic solvent, such as xylene. Those compounds of formula I wherein Q represents a hydrogen atoms can, of course, exist in tautoceric forms, with correspond to the alternatives given for X and Y, and as is clear from the definitions of X and Y, both tantomers fall with the scope of this invention. When Q is an acyl group, the alternative configurations represented by the alternatives forX and Y represent different isomers, which again fall within the scope of this invention. Further, when the moieties R4 andR5 differ from each other the compounds of formula I could be resolved into district enantiomers Which also fall within the scope of the invention. As is well known, it is frequently the case that one such isomer will have greater biological activity than the other isomer or isomers. The compoumd of general formula I have been found to show interesting activity as herbicides. Accordingly, the invention further provides a herbicidal composition comprising a compound of formula I as defined above in association with at least one carrier, and a method of making such a composition which comprises bringing a compound of formula I into association with at least one carrier. The invention also provides the use of such a compound or composition according to the invention as a herbicide. Further, in accordance with the invention there is provided a method of combating undesired plant growth at a locus by treating the locus with a compound or composition according to the invention.Application to the locus may be pre erergence or post emergence. The dosage of active ingredient used may, for example, be from 0.05 to 4kg ha. A carrier in a oomposition according to the invention is any material with which the active ingredient is formulated to facilitate application to the locus to be treated, which may for example be a plant, seed or soil, or to facilitate storage, transport or handling. A carrier may be a solid or a liquid, including a material which is normally gaseous but which has been compressed to form a liquid, and any of the carriers normally used in fornilating herbicidal compositions may be used. Preferably compositions according to the invention contain 0.5 to 95 by weight of active ingredient. Suitable solid carriers include natural and synthetic clays and silicates, for example natural silicas such as diatornaceous earths magnesium silicates, for example talcs magnesium aluminium silicates, for example attapulgites and vermiculites aluminium silicates, for example kaolinites, montomorillonites and micas calcium carbonate calcium sulphate ammonium sulphate synthetic hydrated silicon oxides and synthetic calcium or aluminium silicates elements, for example carbon and sulphur natural and synthetic resins, for example ccumarone resins, polyvinyl chloride, and styrene polymers and copolymers solid polychlorophenols bitumen waxes and solid fertilisers, for example superphosphates. Suitable liquid carriers include water alcohols, for example isopropanol and glycols ketones, for example acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone and cyclohexanone ethers aromatic or araliphatic hydrocarbons, for example benzene, toluene and xylene petroleum fractions, for example kerosine and light mineral oils chlorinated hydrocarbons, for example carbon tetrachloride, perchlorcethylene and trichloroethane. Mixtures of different liquids are often suitable. Agricultural compositions are often forlllated and tranorted in a concentrated form which is subsequently diluted by the user before application. The presence of small amounts of a carrier which is a surface active agent facilitates this process of dilution. Thus preferably at least one carrier in a composition according to the invention is a surface active agent. For example the composition may contain at least two carriers, at least one of which is a surface active agent. A surface active agent may be an emulsifying agent, a dispersing agent or a wetting agent it may be nonionic or ionic. Examples of suitable surface active agents include the sodium or calcium salts of polyacrylic acids and lignin sulphonic acids the condensation of fatty acids or aliphatic amines or amides containing at least 12 carbon atans in the molecule with ethylene oxide and or propylene oxide fatty acid esters of glycerol, sorbitan, sucrose or pentaerythritol condensates of these with ethylene oxide andlor propylene oxide condensation products of fatty alcohol or alkyl phenols, far example p octylphenol or p octylcresol, with ethylene oxide and or propylene oxide sulphates or sulphinates of these condensation products alkali or alkaline earth metal salts, preferably sodium salts, of sulphuric or sulphonic acid esters containing at least 10 carbon atoms in the molecule, for example sodium lauryl sulphate, sodium secondary alkyl sulphates, sodium salts of suiphonated castor oil, and sodium alkylaryl sulphonates such as dodecylbenzene, sulphonate and polymers of ethylene oxide and copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide. The compositions of the invention may for example be formulated as wettable powders, dusts, granules, solutions, enulsifiable concentrates, emulsions, suspension concentrates and aerosols. Nettable powders usually contain 25, 50 or 75 w of active ingredient and usually contain in addition to solid inert carrier, 3 10 w of a dispersing agent and, where necessary, 0 10 w of stabiliser s and or other additives such as penetrants or stickers. Dusts are usually formulated as a dust concentrate having a similar composition to that of a wettable powder but without a dispersant, and are diluted in the field with further solid carrier to give a composition usually containing 10 w of active ingredient.Granules are usually prepared to have a size been 10 and 100 BS mesh 1.676 0.152 mm , and may be manufactured by agglomeration or impregnaticn techniques. Generally, granules will contain 75 w active ingredient and 0 10 w of additives such as stabilisers, surfactants, slow release modifiers and binding agents. The socalled dry flawable powders consist of relatively small granules having a relatively high concentration of active ingredient.Emulsifiable con concentrates usually contain, in addition to a solvent and, when necessary, co solvent, 10 50 w v active ingredient, 2 20 w v emulsifiers and 0 20 w v of other additives such as stabilisers, penetrants and corrosion inhibitors. Suspension conentrates are usually compounded so as to obtain a stable, non sedimenting flowable product and usually contain 10 75 w active ingredient, 0.5 15 w of dispersing agents, 0.1 10 w of suspending agents such as protective colloids and thhhotropic agents, 0 10 w of other additives such as defoamers, corrosion inhibitors, stabilisers, penetrants and stickers, and water or an organic liquid in which the active ingredient is substantially insoluble certain organic solids or inorganic salts may be present dissolved in the formulation to assist in preventing sedimentation or as anti freeze agents for water. Aqueous dispersions and emulsions, for example compositions obtained by diluting a wettable powder or a concentrate according to the invention with water, also lie within the scope of the invention. The said emulsions may be of the water in oil or of the oil in water type, and rray have a thick mayonnaise like consistency. The composition of the invention may also contain other ingredients, for example other compounds possessing herbicidal, insecticidal or fungicidal properties. me invention is illustrated in the following Examples.

The tests fall into two categories, pre emergence and post ernecence. The pre emergence tests involved spraying a liquid fonnulation of the compound onto the soil in which the seeds of the plant species mentioned above had recently been sow. The post eeergence tests involved two types of test, viz., soil drench and foliar spray tests. In the soil drench tests the soil in which the seedling plants of the above species were growling was drenched with a liquid formulation containing a compound of the invention, and in the foliar spray tests the seedling plants were sprayed with such a formulation. The soil used in the tests was a prepared horticultural loam. The formulations used in the tests were prepared from solutions of the test compounds in acetone containing 0.4 by weight of an alkylphenol ethylene oxide condensate available under the trade mark TRITON X 155. These acetone solutions were diluted with water and the resulting formulations applied at dosage levels corresponding to 5 kg or 1 kg of active material per hectare in a volume equivalent to 600 litres per hectare in the soil spray and foliar spray test, and at a dosage of level equivalent to 10 kilograms of active material per hectare in a volute equivalent to approximately 3,000 litres per hectare in the soil drench tests. In the energence tests untreated soon soil and in the post emergence tests untreated soil bearing seedling plants were used as controls. The herbicidal effects of the test compounds were assessed visually twelve days after spraying the foliage and the soil, and thirteen days after drenching the soil and were recorded on a 0 9 scale. A rating 0 indicates growth as untreated control, a rating 9 indicates death. An increase of 1 unit on the linear scale approximates to a 10 increase in the level of effect.
