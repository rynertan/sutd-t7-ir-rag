# Low fuel consumption tire with all weather performances.

## Abstract
Disclosed herein is a low fuel consumption pneumatic tire with all weather running performances, which tire uses as a tread a vulcanizable rubber composition obtained by adding 30 80 by weight of carbon black having an iodine adsorption value of not less than 70 mg g and a dibutylphthalate DBP ab sorption of not less than 90 ml 100 g, and a low temperature plasticizing ester and or naphthenic or paraffinic softener in an amount 2 to 50 by weight relative to said carbon black into 100 parts by weight of a rubber component composed of 100 to 25 parts by weight of at least one kind of a first diene rubber containing 0 to 30 of styrene and 25 to 95 of vinyl bonds in the butadiene unit and 0 to 75 parts by weight of at least one kind of a second diene rubber which is different in kind from the above first diene rubber.
