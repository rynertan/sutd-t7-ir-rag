## Description
TITLE ONE PIECE PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARD CONNECTOR SHELLBackaround of the Invention This invention relates to electrical connectors for printed circuit boards PC8s , and more particularly to metal shells for PCB connectors. PCB connectors. such as the well known D typeN connector, typically include an array of metal terminals in a thermoplastic housing. The nose of the housing is typically provided with an outer metal shell structure which serves a variety of functions. The shell structure protects and reinforces the connector housing where the mating cable terminating connector is attached. The shell tends to reduce electromagnetic emission from the connector during operation. The shell may also provide a ground connection for the shield of the cable connected to the connector. And the shell may provide attachment sites or structures for mechanically securing the connector to the PCB and or for securing the mating cable terminating connector to the PCB connector. The known shell structures are made up of several pieces riveted or bolted together. These structures have a number of disadvantages. They are relatively costly. in part because of the need to assemble them from many separate parts. They may leak electromagnetic radiation between constituent parts. And they do not always lend themselves to robotic PCB assembly. It is therefore an object of this invention to improve and simplify PCB connector shell structures. Summarv of the Invention This and other objects of the invention are accomplished in accordance with the principles of the invention by providing a one piece PCB connector shell structure. The shell structure includes a hollow annular nose portion, a planar flange portion projecting radially outward from one open end of the nose portion, and a pair of laterally spaced PCB mounting tabs extending from the edge of the flange in the opposite direction from the nose portion, the mounting tabs being co planar and substantially perpendicular to the plane of the flange. The shell is preferably made of or converted to spring steel, and particularly preferred embodiments include integral spring fingers for engaging the associated connector housing and thereby securing the shell to the housing.Preferred embodiments may also include integral PCB retaining latches extending down from the PCB mounting tabs through apertures in the PCB for engaging the underside of the PCB and thereby helping to hold the connector on the PCB. If desired, these latches may be soldered to the PCB ground circuit. Non latching grounding tabs may be substituted for these latches. Integral stabilizers may extend beyond the PCB latches or grounding tabs.Apertures may be provided in the mounting tabs for additional means e.g., bolts or rivets for holding the connector to the PCB. Other apertures may be provided in the flange for jack screws or bolts for securing a cable terminating connector to the PCB connector. Because the shell is preferably hardened spring steel, these jack screw apertures may be threaded and no additional reinforcement, such as a nut, is required to retain a jack screw in each aperture. Further features of the invention, its nature and various advantages will be more apparent from the accompanying drawings and the following detailed description of the invention.Brief Descrintion of the Drawings Figure 1 is an exploded perspective view of a female PCB connector including the shell of this invention.

Figure 8 is a front elevational view of an alternative embodiment of the PCB connector shell of this invention. Figure 9 is a side elevational view of the connector of Figure 8. Figure 10 is a top plan view of the connector of Figure 8. Figures 11 14 are partial perspective views of other alternative embodiments of the PCB connector shell of this invention.Detailed Description of the Invention As shown in Figure 1 a typical female ZD typeH PCB connector 10 includes thermoplastic contact housing 12 having a D shaped nose portion 14 projecting outwardly from a somewhat larger main body portion 16. Housing 12 contains a plurality of metal terminals 40, each of which includes 1 a female contact area 42 located just inside an associated one of housing apertures 18 and 2 a solder tail 44 extending downwardly from the rear of the housing.In the particular embodiment shown in Figures 1 6, solder tails 44 are adapted to extend downwardly through apertures in PCB 20 so that they can be soldered to printed circuitry on the lower surface of the PCB. Alternatively, solder tails 44 can be configured as shown in Figure 7 for soldering to printed circuitry on the upper surface of PCB 20. Reference number 50 denotes the one piecePCB connector shell of this invention. Connector shell 50 includes annular nose portion 52 which fits around housing nose portion 14. A planar flange 54 extends. radially outward from one open end of nose portion 52 in all directions. Flange 54 fits up against radially outwardly extending shoulder 22 at the base of housing nose portion 14. Adjacent each end of the edge of flange 54 is a rearwardly extending PCB mounting tab 56. Mounting tabs 56 are substantially co planar and perpendicular to the plane of flange 54. As is best seen in Figures 4 and 5, the plane of tabs 56 is preferably below housing 12. Tabs 56 bear on the upper surface of PCB 20 and align connector 10 with the plane of the PCB.Apertures 58 may be provided in tabs 56 to facilitate securing connector 10 to PCB 20 by means of bolts, rivets, or the like. The end of each mounting tab 56 remote from flange 54 is bent downwardly and forked to provide two parallel, laterally spaced tines 62a and 62b.Tines 62 terminate in synclinal ramp surfaces 64a and 64b, respectively. Behind ramp surfaces 64 are outwardly projecting shoulders 66a apd 66b, respectively. Elements 62, 64, and 66 constitute latches 60 for latching connector 10 to PCB 20. As shown in Figures 5 and 6, each pair of tines 62 extends down through a hole in PCB 20 so that shoulders 66 can engage the underside of the PCB.Synclinal ramp surfaces 64 facilitate insertion of tines 62 through the PCB hole. Tines 62 are typically deflected toward one another while ramp surfaces 64 are in contact with the side of the hole, and then tines 62 spring back to their initial spacing to force shoulders 66 outwardly under the lower surface of the PCB. If desired, tines 62 can be soldered to the ground circuit of PCB 20. For example, if there is a ground circuit on the lower surface of PCB 20, the lower ends of tines 62 can be soldered to that ground circuit. Each side of nose portion 52 includes an inwardly projecting spring finger 70 for allowing housing nose portion 14 to be pushed into nose portion 52 from behind flange 54, and for thereafter engaging the sides of housing nose portion 14 to prevent separation of housing 12 and shell 50. Each spring finger 70 is integral with nose portion 52 along the end of the spring finger that is adjacent flange 54. The remainder of each spring finger is inclined inwardly of nose portion 52 in the direction away from flange 54. Accordingly, as housing nose portion 14 is pushed into nose portion 52, spring fingers 70 contact the sides of the housing nose portion but deflect away from one another to admit the housing nose portion into nose portion 52. Once housing nose portion 14 is in nose portion 52, however, the free ends of spring fingers 70 i.e., the ends remote from flange 54 , tend to dig into the sides of housing nose portion 14 to é prevent separation of housing 12 and shell 50. Thus spring fingers 70 constitute highly effective means for securing shell 50 to housing 12. Adjacent each end of flange 54 an aperture 80 may be provided for insertion of jack screws or bolts not shown for the purpose of securing to connector 10 a male cable terminating connector also not shown that is plugged into female PCB connector 10. If desired, apertures 80 may be internally threaded so that the jack screws can be threaded directly into apertures 80 with no need for a nut behind flange 54. Shell 50 is preferably made of metal such as conventional 1035 cold rolled steel. Shell 50 is fully formed and then preferably heat treated e.g., to Rockwell C35 hardness to harden the steel and give it spring steel properties. This heat treating strengthens the resilience of tines 62 and spring fingers 70. It also hardens the threads provided in apertures 80 as described above. Shell 50 may be conventionally plated e.g., with 93 tin, 7z lead to make it solderable and better able to resist rust and or corrosion, Figures 8 10 show a shell 150 for use on a male ZD type PCB connector. The thermoplastic housing not shown of the male connector does not have a nose portion like nose portion 14 in the female connector.Instead, it has an array of laterally spaced male contact pins that project into the area bounded by the nose portion 152 of shell 150. Because the male connector housing does not have a nose, shell nose 152 also does not include spring fingers like spring fingers 70 in the female connector shell. Instead, shell 150 has four latch fingers 170 extending rearwardly from the periphery of flange 154 for engaging rearwardly facing shoulders on the main body portion of the male contact housing. Like spring fingers 70 in the female connector, latch fingers 170 allow the male connector housing to be pushed into shell 150 from behind flange 154 and thereafter prevent the shell and housing from separating. Except for the differences mentioned above, male connector shell 150 may be substantially similar to female connector shell 50. Accordingly, the same reference numbers are used throughout Figures 1 10 for features which are substantially identical throughout those Figures. Figures 11 14 show several alternative shapes for PCB mounting tabs 56. In Figure 11, latches 60 are omitted from the mounting tabs. InFigure 12, latches 60 are again omitted, but mounting tabs 56 are extended to accommodate two holes 58a and 58b for use in securing the connector to the PCB. InFigure 13, latches 60 are replaced by solid grounding tabs 160 which project downwardly through the PCB for soldering to a ground circuit on the lower surface of the PCB. In Figure 14, in addition to latches 60, each mounting tab has a U shaped stabilizer 68 which extends beyond the latch in the direction away from the shell flange. Stabilizers 68 increase the area of contact between the shell and the upper surface of the PCB and thereby increase the stability of the connector on the PCB. This may be beneficial in robotic assembly of PCBs. Stabilizers 68 can also be used with non latching grounding tabs of the type shown in Figure 13.
