# Drawing apparatus for textile fibre webs.

## Abstract
The drawing apparatus for textile fibre webs comprises a series of pairs of rolls 3, 4 5, 6 8, 9 the peripheral velocity of the rolls of each pair being greater than the peripheral velocity of the preceding pair in the direction of advance of the web M . Each roll has a resilient covering constituted by highly flexible steel wires that extend substantially radially. A smaller diameter smooth roller 7, 10 is interposed between each pair of covered rolls and the following pair, the smaller diameter roller having a peripheral velocity equal to that of the following pair. The disposition of the smooth rollers is such as to impart a sinuous course to the web and keep the web in engagement with the metal wires of the covered rolls over substantial arcs. The drawing apparatus achieves higher drawing ratios with a good quality of the drawn web using a smaller number of pairs of rolls.
