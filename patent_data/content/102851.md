# A closure for a container.

## Abstract
There is disclosed a closure, more particularly but not exclusively for blood sampling tubes comprising a core section of elastomeric material constructed and arranged to be received at least partially within the container, and an annular outer section of substantially non elastomeric mate rial disposed radially of the core section, the annular section being spaced from the core section over a part of its length to provide an annular recess for receipt of the container neck.
