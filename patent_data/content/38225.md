# ELECTRIC TYPEWRITER

## Abstract
The typewriter comprises a carriage 82, a mechanical keyboard and type character support hammers. The ham mers are connected to levers 62 which can be selected by the keyboard keys and engaged via intermediate levers by a drive frame 73 for the striking of the selected hammer. The drive frame is actuated by a solenoid electromagnet 92 which is connected to mains voltage and is controlled by a microprocessor by way of a triac and rectifier. Carriage advancement takes place on each energisation of the elec tromagnet unless specifically deactivated, and carriage return takes place by means of a spring which is loaded during advancement. The carriage return 169 and back space 144 keys are connected to the electromagnet and microprocessor. In addition, the carriage return key acti vates a sequence of commands executed under the control of a mechanical member 176, 177. The microprocessor controls the positioning of the carriage by means of a carriage spacing sensor, and then activates the execution of the functions chosen on the keyboard if in agreement with the margins of the line of type. The machine is also provided with a contact type keyboard and a selector by means of with four different margin and tabulation stop programmes can be memorised in a non volatile memory The carriage tabulations are initiated by the contact keyboard keys, which also comprises a set of decimal tabulators.
