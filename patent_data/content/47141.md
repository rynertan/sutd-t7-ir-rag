# Testing equipment for electric components.

## Abstract
A testing equipment for electric components comprises a high temperature section including a homoiothermic chamber in which a plurality of components to be tested are heated, and a first printed board on which the components to be tested are mounted a low temperature section including a driving circuit for the components to be tested, a second printed board on which the driving circuit is mounted, and electric power sources and a connecting unit for electrical connection between the high temperature and low temperature sections. The connecting unit comprises a third printed board disposed outside the homoiothermic chamber, one surface of the third printed board facing the wall of the homoiothermic chamber with a space therebetween a first connector jack mounted on the one surface of the third printed board through electrical conductor pins and a second connector jack mounted on the other surface of the third printed board. The first and second printed boards are connected to the first and second connector jacks, respec tively, and the electric power sources are connected to the third printed board.
