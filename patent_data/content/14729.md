# A digital eddy current apparatus for identifying specimens of electrically conductive material of unknown composition.

## Abstract
A apparatus comprising a parallel coil 15 and a capaci tance C2 , the coil 15 having an air gap in which an unknown specimen is inserted, a source of alternating voltage applied to the coil capacitance combination 15, D2 , scanning means e.g. 20 for automatically varying the value of the capacitance in steps, thus varying the phase of the voltage across the coil 15 , means 22 for digitizing the phase of the voltage corres ponding to each capacitance value, a memory 31 in which those digitized phase values are stored, a reference memory 29 or 30 containing digitized phase values for known speci mens, and means 26 for comparing the digitized phase val ues of the unknown specimen with those of known speci mens. A digital tolerance control circuit 14 is also provided which accomodates deviations between the reference and the known phase values, up to predetermined amounts, and means 33 are provided for displaying the generic name or grade of the stored phase values which match the phase values of the unknown specimen.
