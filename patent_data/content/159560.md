# PSK demodulator having an AFC circuit.

## Abstract
The PSK demodulator comprises voltage controlled os cillator means 8 responsive to a control signal frequency converter means 9 for frequency converting an input PSK signal with the output of the voltage controlled, oscillator means carrier recovery circuit means 2 for recovering a car rier wave from the output of the frequency converter means band pass filter means 4 receiving the carrier wave phase detector means 1 for phase detecting the output of the fre quency converter means with the output of said band pass fil ter means and providing a demodulated signal phase compa rator means 6 for detecting the phase difference between the input and output signals of the band pass filter means and low pass filter means 7 responsive to the output of the phase comparator means for providing the control signal. This PSK demodulator is essentially unaffected by frequency fluctua tions of the input modulated waves.
