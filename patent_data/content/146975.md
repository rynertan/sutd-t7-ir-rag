# SHORT DETECTOR FOR PROMS

## Abstract
Test circuitry is included in a PROM memory for detecting shorts between bit lines and word lines and shorts or leaks in a memory cell. The circuitry enables a selected positive voltage to be applied across all memory cells in the memory so that the existence of leaky memory cells or shorts in the memory can be detected during testing. The test circuitry has no appreciahle effect on the memory during normal operation of the memory.
