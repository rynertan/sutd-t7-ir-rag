# Child resistant closures.

## Abstract
A child resistant threaded closure 10 for containers includes a lower ring like portion 12 which is attached to the closure sidewall by two diametrically opposite retract able and extendible links 13 and has a matching thread segment. With the closure screwed in place on a container, the ring 12 is pushed downwardly by means of diametri cally opposite tabs 17 to a position below the last thread on the container with the links extended. In this position, when an attempt is made to unscrew the closure, the thread seg ment of the ring 12 interfers with the last thread of the container and prevents its removal. For the closure to be removed, the ring 12 must be lifted up by the tabs 17 until the links are fully retracted and the thread segment matches up with the thread in the closure sidewall, whereupon the closure can be unscrewed.
