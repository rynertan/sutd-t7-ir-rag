## Description
This invention relates to a novel stereoselective process for preparing a 4 O tetrahydropyranyl derivative of an anthracycline compound having a daunosamine residue. The anthracycline compounds of the formula IEMI1.1 so far used widely in clinical practice as chemotherapeutic agents are daunomycin of said formula in which R represents a hydrogen atom, and adriamycin of said formula in which P. represents a hydroxyl group. Although daunomycin and adriamycin show considerably potent anticancer activity, they are not entirely satisfactory. In an attempt to discover com pounds having more potent anticancer activity, various analogues have been provided by various methods, such as fermentation, semi synthesis, total synthesis and microbiological transformation. The present inventors have also provided useful derivatives of daunomycin and adriamycin which are compounds having a tetrahydropyranyl group at the 4position of the daunosamine residue, i.e.EMI1.2 These 4 0 tetrahydropyranyl compounds are, for example, described in JP A2 56 494 82 Jap. Examined Patent Publica tion and JP A1 156 300 81 Jap. Laid Open Unexamined PatentPublication Such tetrahydropyranyl compounds include two isomers which are ascribed to the configuration on the C 2 position of the tetrahydropyran 2 yl group, as stated previously. One of the isomers shows a higher Rf value on silica gel thin layer chromatography using chloroform methanol 9 1 as a developer hereinafter referred to as Compounds b , and the other shows a lower Rf value on the same chromatography thereinafter referred to as Compounds a .Compound b , in particular, has been found to have much more potent anticancer activity against tumors in experimental animals than daunomycin and adriamycin have. Its development as a drug for clinical practice has therefore been desired strongly.According to the aforementioned known manufacturing methods, Il O tetrahydropyranyl derivatives of anthracycline compounds have been formed as Compound a and Compound bj each in an approximately equal amount. There has been a demand, therefore, for a process by which Compound b showing very potent anticancer activity can be selectively obtained at a high yield among these isomers. It has now been found that tetrahydropyranyl derivatives can be obtained with increased content of Compound b without accompanying any decrease in their total yields by using a metal containing Lewis acid as a catalyst in place of an organic sulfonic acid.This invention relates, therefore, to a process for preparing, at a higher content, a stereoisomer showing a higherRf value on silica gel thin layer chromatography using chloroform methanol 9 1 as a developer, among stereoiso mers ascribed to the configuration on the C 2 position of the tetrahydropyran 2 yl group of a 4 0 tetrahydropyranyl derivative of an anthracycline compound expressed by the formula II EMI3.1 wherein R represents a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom or a protected hydroxyl group, which comprises reacting an anthracycline compound of the formula I EMI3.2 wherein R is as defined above, or an acid addition salt thereof, with 3,4 dihydro 2H pyran in an inert solvent in the presence of a metal containingLewis acid. The process of the invention is applicable to anthracycline compounds having a daunosamine residue, such as daunomycins, adriamycins, carminomycins and feudomycins, and derivatives arising from their aglycones see, for example,The Journal of Antibiotics, Vol. 14, 1596 1607, 1981 . Compounds preferred because of their anticancer activity as compounds of the formula I derived from daunomycin and adriamycin are, for example, those in which R represents a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom or a protected hydroxyl group. Specifically, there are cited compounds in which said halogen atom is a bromine atom see, for instance, JapaneseLaid Open Unexamined Patent Publication No. 165300 81 quoted previously , and compounds in which said protected hydroxyl group is a group easily convertible into a hydroxyl group by mild hydrolysis, such as a lower alkanoyl group, an aralkylcarbonyl group, or an aromatic carbonyl group see, for example, United States Patent No. 3, 803, 124 .The latter compounds with the protected hydroxyl group as R should be those which can be converted into tetrahydropyranyl derivatives according to the process of this invention and then subjected to hydrolysis, hydrogenolysis or the like to convert the R into a hydroxy group. Examples of the metal containing Lewis acids for use in the process of this invention are those halides of typical metals and transition metals excluding alkali metals and alkaline earth metals which can be used as Lewis acids.Their typical examples are AlCi3, AlBr3, A1I3, TiCl4, FeC13, SnCl4, ZnCl2, etc. Organometallic compounds which act as Lewis acids, such as C2H5 2AlCl and CH3A1C12, can also be used as the Lewis acids of this invention. Of these compounds, the use of AlC13, TiC14 and AlBr3 are preferred to form Compound b with increased selectivity according to the present invention. The inert solvents for use in the process of this invenntion may be any organic solvents which does not substan tially affect the reaction for forming the tetrahydropyranyl derivative and which can prepare a uniform reaction mixture. Its preferred examples are aprotic polar solvents, such as N,N dimethylformamide hereinafter referred to asDMF , dimethyl sulfoxide, tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile, and nitromethane. Suitable solvents can be selected by considering whether they can form a uniform reaction solvent system, the properties of the starting compound of the formula I and the characters of Lewis acid used. The reaction between the compound of formula I and 3,4 dihydro 2H pyran of the formulaEMI5.1 in the presence of the Lewis acid is performed in the above mentioned solvent advantageously under mild temperature at which no substantial decomposition of the starting compounds takes place, preferably, at room temperature or below, concretely, a temperature ranging from about 30 to about 300C. Under such conditions, the reaction completes normally in a period of from 2 to 48 hours. The amount of the metal containing Lewis acid used in converting the compound of the formula I into its tetrahydropyranyl derivative can be varied widely depending on the type of the Lewis acid, the reaction conditions, etc. However, it is used in 2 to 10 molar equivalents in general, preferably 4 to 6 molar equivalents, per mol of the compound of the formula I . The amount of 3,Il dihydro 2H pyran for use in the formation of the tetrahydropyranyl derivative is not less than 10 molar equivalents, preferably 100 to 1000 molar equivalents, per mol of the compound of the formula I . After the reaction is completed, the compound of the formula II , the tetrahydropyranyl derivative, can be subjected to isolation and purification steps including dissolution of isomers, i.e., Compound a and Compound b by various methods that are known per se. For this purpose, methods that are frequently used in the isolation and purification of anthracycline antibiotics may be employed to isolate the intended compound from the reaction mixture.If the resulting compound has a halogen atom or a protected hydroxyl group as R, it may be hydrolyzed, if desired, without being isolated or purified, whereby a tetrahydropyranyl derivative of adriamycin can be obtained. For details, see the aforecited patents. Example 1 Preparation of 4 O tetrahydropyran 2 yl 14 bromo daunomycin 25 mg of 14 bromodaunomycin hydrobromide was dissolved in 2.5 ml of anhydrous DMF, and 25 mg of anhydrous aluminum chloride was added, followed by stirring the mixture for 1 hour at room temperature. During this period, the reaction mixture changed from red into purple. Then, 1 ml of 3,4 dihydro 2H pyran was added, and the resulting mixture was reacted for 18 hours with stirring at room temperature. Upon completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture was poured into 0.1M sodium bicarbonate containing disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate EDTA 2Na .After the mixture was stirred for several hours, it was extracted with ethyl acetate.
