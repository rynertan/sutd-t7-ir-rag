A process for the production of pyroglutamyltryptophan monohydrate comprising A reacting tryptophan etyl ester hydrochloride and pyro glutamic acid in the presence of triethylamine and dicyclo hexyl carbodiimide in a dimethylformamide solution removing the solvent and recovering pyroglutamyl tryptophan ethyl ester as a reaction product andB reacting pyroglutamyl tryptophan ethylester with an aqueous solution of NaOH 2.5 N filtering, extracting the filtrate with ethyl acetate and adding HC1 to pH 1.5 cooling to form a precipitate recovering said precipitate and recrystallizing from water. 2. A process for the production of pyroglutamyl tryptophan monohydrate, comprising A reacting N carbobenzoxy pyroglutamic acid and tryptophan ethyl ester hydrochloride in a solution of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran, in the presence of triethylamine and ethylchloroformate at a room temperature removing the solvent and stirring the reaction product in a water chloroform mixture recovering the organic phase so formed, drying Qfii crystallizing N carbobenzoxy pyroglutamyl tryptophan ethyl ester from petroleum ether reacting said compound in a methanol solution with a hydrogen stream in the presence of a palladium catalyst to form a precipitate recovering said precipitate and crystallizing pyroglutamyl tryptophan ethyl ester from ethylacetate andB reacting pyroglutamyl tryptophan ethyl ester with an aqueous solution of NaOH 2.5 N filtering, extracting the filtrate with ethyl acetate and adding HCl to pH 1.5 cooling to form a precipitate recovering said precipitate and recrystallizing from water. 3. Pyroglutamyl tryptophan monohydrate having the following characteristic bands at I.R. spectrum 1 3600 cm crystallisation H20 l 3400 cm indole N H 1 3240 3310 cm lactame and amide N H 1730 cm free carboxy group l 1630 1660 cm carbonylamide and lactame group and showing the following characteristic bands at RMN 13 spectrum C things, there is a significant correlation between decreased serotonin levels and insomnia. c A role for serotonin has recently been proposed in the pain function, especially with regard to headaches central in origin. Since the presence of 5 hydroxytryptophan in the encephalon is due entirely to on site synthesis because 5hydroxytryptophan does not pass the hematoencephalic barrier, the importance of its precursor becomes apparent, that is tryptophan, for which there is an active transport mechanism at the cerebral level. Therefore, the use of tryptophan was previously attempted in pathological conditions involving serotonin, such as those indicated above. However, for example, the treatment of depressed patients with tryptophan led to contradictory results, in that the increase in plasmatic tryptophan seemed not to induce a proportional increase in the concentration of cerebral tryptophan. It was suggested that this occurred because the tryptophan transport mechanism in the encephalon is affected by the levels of the other amino acids, which can compete with the vehicle or carrier see A. Carlsson In psycopharmacology, a generation of progress Ed. M.A. Lipton, A. Di Mascio, K.F. Killam Raven Press, NewYork, pages 1057 1070, 1978 . Moreover, it has been shown that increased tryptophan concentrations lead to an activation of tryptophan pyrrolase, the first enzyme of the metabolic pathway leading to nicotinic acid, with conseauent lower availability of cerebral tryptophan for serotonin synthesis see S. Garattin, L. Valselli, Serotonin Elsevier,Amsterdam, 1965 . It should also be noted that kynurenine intermediate in the process from tryptophan to nicotinic acid interfers with tryptophan transport in the encephalon seeT.M. Speight, G.S. Avery Drugs ,3,159 1972 and 0. Sjaastad Acta Neurol. Scand. ,51,200 1975 . Thus increased plasma concentration of kynurenine has the effect of further lowering the level of cerebral tryptophan. It should be kept in mind that tryptophan exerts an ef fect not only at the cerebral level, but also in other tissues this can lead to an increase in the level of nicotinic acid which, as already mentioned, forms part of the pyridinic coenzymes which catalyze oxidation reduction reactions, essential for tissue respiration.

Pharmaceutical composition containing a pharmaceutically effective amount of pyroglutamyl tryptophan ethyl ester, and pharmaceutically compatible excipients. Nicotinic acid deficiency gives rise to a known symptomatology which in addition to dermatitis and disturbances of the gastrointestinal system, is characterized by signs of cerebral compromise, such as irritability, insomnia, depression, poor memory, headaches.Pyroglutamic acid is also a natural amino acid, with the following interesting properties. 1 It is found as the N terminal residue at the beginning of the chain of various neuro hormones like TRH and LS RH .Its presence may be interpreted both as a defense against hexopeptidase attack and as a means to facilitate passage through the membrane, since it is more lipophilic than other chemically related amino acids like glutamic acid. 2 It is involved in the d glutamylic cycle, proposed amont other things as the general mecahnism for amino acid transport in the cells. This cycle includes the synthesis and breakdown of glutathione, and the enzymes involved in it are present in various tissues in the mammary gland, encephalon and skin.An active intermediate in the cycle, pyroglutamate also enhances the rate of glutathione synthesis and turnover. Consistent with these observations, it has been shown that in the presence of pyroglutamate, amino acid absorption by the cells is increased. In addition to being implicated in the mechanism of amino acid transport, glutathione has an important role in the protection of the cellular membranes and proteins, maintaining the sulfidrylic groups and interacting with hydrogen peroxides and free radicals.It has also been observed that glutathione can give rise to a small accumulation of triglycerides in hipatic steatosis.Thus, as an active intermediate in the cycle involving the synthesis and breakdown of glutathione, pryoglutamate plays a role as detoxifier and liver protector.It has recently been reported that chronic treatment with ethanol leads to inhibition of tryptophan pyrrolase limiting enzyme in the process leading to formation of nicotinic acid and that this inhibition is reversed by pyroglutamic acid. This suggests its eventual application in conditions of alcohol intoxication. 3 It has been known for some time that glutamic acid can be formed in the encephalon starting from proline, in a process with pyroglutamic acid 5 oxo proline as an intermediate. On the other hand, it is known that one of the roles of glutamic acid in the central nerv ous system in addition to being a GABA precursor and a regulator of ammonia levels is that of neurotransmitter exciter it could therefore possibly be used in cases of cerebral depression. However, glutamic acid passes the hematoencephalic barrier only with great difficulty, while pyroglutamic acid, given its cyclization, is more lipophilic and so passes the membrane more easily, to the point of being used as carrier or vehicle for some hormones.Thus administration of pyroglutamic acid may lead to increased encephalic levels of glutamic acid this may be an important mecahnism by which pyroglutamate exerts its trophic action in the central nervous system. Therefore, administration of pyroglutamic acid brings it to increased levels, and this increase may be helpful in cases of psychic fatigue, dementia and intellectual deficit.The quite surprising discovery has now been made that the bond between pyroglutamic acid and tryptophan facilitates tryptophan passage through the hematoencephalic barrier and so access to nervous system cells. It has been shown that pyaroglutamyltryptophan easily reaches the brain cells in concentrations sufficient to re establish the compromised physiological eauilibrium, giving a charge of the two amino acids greater than does administration of the individual components. This leads to increased 5 hydroxytryptophan levels due to the charge of tryptophan in cases where this increase is considered useful, for example depressive conditions, sleep disturbances, hemicrania and central nervous system origin headaches.The dipeptide molecule pyroglutamyl tryptophan would at other levels be useful in cases of hepatic pathologies, alcoholism, hyperamnoiemia. PreparationIt has been found that by condensing pyroglutamic acid I as such or as its N carbobenzoxy derivative with tryptophan II EMI8.1 in the presence of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, a dipeptide molecule is obtained corresponding to the followin pyroglutamyltryptophan III EMI9.1 As a variant, the same molecule may be obtained with the mixed anhydride method, as shown by the example in the present invention.During the synthesis procedure, the ethyl ester of pyroglutamyltryptophan is also obtained, corresponding to formula IV EMI9.2 This ester is also active in the pharmacological reactions mentioned above with reference to the monohydrate acid molecule.Thus the following form the object of the present invention pyroglutamyltryptophan, molecular formula C16H17N304 H20, molecular weight 333g mol pyroglutamyl tryptophan ethyl ester, C18H21N304, molecular weight 343g mol, based on the structures reported above.For the sake of brevity in the following description the new compounds defined above will be indicated with the generic names pGlu Trp and pGlu Trp ethyl ester .The chemical structure of the molecules which form the object of the present invention may be determined on the basis of the following considerations, taking into account the fact that they are purely indicative and non limiting to the present invention, since obviously another crystalline form than the monohydrate of pGluTrp and a different alkyl substitution than ethyl for the ester derivative, would lead to compounds with the same activity characteristics as those claimed in the present invention and should not be considered new with respect to it.The pGlu Trp monohydrate according to the present invention is a white oderless crystalline powder, air stable and readily oxidized by water, with a 130 1320C Kofler melting point.The structure was determined by means of elementary analysis C H,N , IR and NMR 13c spectra.

The internal standard for the frequency of the field was provided by using deuterated solvents.The sample was dissolved in 2.5ml of DMSO d6 in a 10mmNMR tube and inserted in a co probe with a 10mm insert at 250C. All 13C chemical shifts are reported with respect to the C resonance frequency of TMS, used as internal standard. Signal assignment for the various carbon atoms in the molecule is in perfect agreement with the shift interval reported in the correlation tables for 13C NMR signals on the other hand, a study of compounds representing the various fragments of the molecule reveals a striking agreement between the chemical shift 13 of the C NMR signals of the reference structures and those of the test sample.

Tests on pharmacological effects of DL pyroqlutam tryptophan and ethyles ter thereof.Behavioral effects of DL pyroglutamyl tryptophan pGlu Trp have been studied in male rats of Wistar strain purchased from Morini, Italy , weighing 130 10 g at the onset of experiments. Animals were kept under lightdark cycle lights on between 8.00 and 20.00 with standard food and water available ad lib. Animals were injected intraperitoneally ip with 10 or 100 mg kg of pGluTrp dissolved in a solution of NaHCO3 1 N and adjusted at pH 7.4 with HCl 0.1 N. Control animals received injection of the vehicle alone. Injections were performed 1 h prior to the behavioral testing. The animals were used only once for the behavioral experiments.Acquisition of active avoidance behavior was studied in a single session test. The rats were trained to avoid the unconditioned stimulus US of a scrambled electrical footshock 0.20 mA delivered through the grid floor. The conditioned stimulus CS was a buzzer presented for 5 sec prior to the US. If no escape occurred within 20 sec of CS US presentation, the shock was terminated. A maximum of 30 conditioning trials were given with a variable intertrial interval averaging 60 sec. The learning criterion was 5 consecutive conditioned avoidance responses CARs . For those animals that reached this criterion in less than 30 trials, the remaining trials up to a total of 30 were considered as lARs. Indexes of avoidance behavior were the total number of CARs and the number of learners. Open field behavior was studied in a circular open field arena. Ambulation number of floor units entered , rearing, grooming and defecation scores were recorded during a 5 min observation session.Hot plate test for analgesia was studied with a circular hot plate 520 C where the animals were placed singularly.The latency in sec to the first behavioral reaction to hot pain licking of paw was recorded.Acquisition of shuttle box active avoidance behavior appeared to be slightly decreased in rats injected ip with 10 mg kg of pGlu Trp as compared to controls 12.7 1.99 vs. 14.8 1.50, difference not significant .However, when pGlu Trp was injected at the dose of 100 mg kg, it significantly increased the number ofCARs and the percentage of learners as compared to those of control rats 19.0 1.21 vs 14.2 1.47, p O.02 90.9 vs 66.6 .Ambulation of rats injected2 ip with 10 mg kg of pGluTrp appeared to be decreased as compared to that of controls 78.5 4.4 vs. 94.5 4.7 . No difference was found in rearing and grooming of treated and control rats. Furthermore, defecation boli were decreased after ip injection of pGlu Trp lO mg kg . Injection of pGlu Trp 100 mg kg caused a change in open field behavior similar to that observed after the administration of the smaller dose. No analgesic effect was found in rats injected ip with 10 mg kg of pGlu Trp and tested in hot plate test for analgesia. Similar tests were carried out by administering analogous doses of pGlu Trp ethyl ester, said tests showing similar results.In conclusion it appears that an administration of pGlu Trp or ethyl ester derivative thereof results in central effects.The behavioral action leads to an improving in learning capacity a reduction in locomotor activity a reduction in defecation.Possible clinical implications would be nootropic effect improvement of learning capacity sedative effect anti anxiety effect. Pharmacological action pGlu Trp and pGlu Trp ethyl ester have been shown to have a pronounced neurotropic and antipsychotic effect due to the fact that the capacity of pyroglutamic acid to facilitate cross membrane absorption of amino acids and its function as a carrier lead to higher levels of the two amino acids at the target tissues involved.In fact, it has been shown that the peptide reaches the target with no structural changes, after which the two amino acids follow their own specific pathways and participate in the biochemical cycles involved.This new molecule thus is of evident utility when applied in human therapy as shown clearly in the above discussion.Therapeutic indicationsIn consideration of the pharmacological results, pGluTrp and pGlu Trp ethyl ester may be found useful in human therapy, for the treatment in general of diseases of the central nervous system and in particular of depressive conditions in general, hemicrania and vasomotor headaches, pain syndromes central in origin, sleep disturbances, dementia, psychic fatigue, nocturnal enuresis, intellectual deficit, acute and chronic hepato pathy, chronic alcoholism, hyperammoniemia, conditions of sensory obnubilation. Various pharmaceutical forms may be selected for these indications, containing from 500 to 1000mg of active principle, including the following preferred but in no sense limiting examples a oral capsules, tablets, pills, drinkable ampuls and effervescent packets b parenteral sterile intramuscular and intravenous injectable ampuls.Of course the pharmaceutical formulations may include in addition to the active principle, the usual pharmaceutically compatible vehicles and adjuvants, according to pharmaceutical techniques. Moreover, it is clear that the administration forms and the relative dosage schemes may be varies as required by the clinical application and by the judgment of the attending physicians.
