# Siloxane photoinitiators with aryoyl formate groups.

## Abstract
Polyorganosiloxane photoinitiators containing aryoyl for mate photomoietios bonded to silicon atoms via non hydro lyzable Si C bonds. They may be prepared from alkenyl or alkynyl aryoyl formates and polyorganosiloxanes containing silicon hydride groups via hydrosilation. They are effective photoinitiators for photocurable silicone resins and for ethylenically unsaturated monomers, producing cured films with good weatherability and low temperature flexibility.
