European Patent Publication Number 0015690 Al discloses inter alia penicillin derivatives having a sulphonic acid or sulphonyl ester grouping in the side chain. One process disclosed for the preparation of the penicillin derivatives comprises reacting an ester of 6,ss amino 6,a methoxy penicillanic acid with an activated derivative of an acid of formula A EMI1.1 wherein R is C16 alkyl an optionally substituted 5membered heterocyclic ring containing one or two heteroatoms selected from oxygen, sulphur and nitrogen phenyl mono substituted phenyl where the substituent is halogen, hydroxy, C16 alkoxy, nitro, amino, C1 6 alkyl, C1,6 haloalkyl, C1 6 alkylcarbonyloxy, or C16 alkyl sulphonylamino for example NHSO2CH3 or di substituted phenyl where the substituents are selected from hydroxy, halogen, methoxy, acetoxy and amino and X is hydrogen or C16 alkyl. The present invention provides a process for the preparation of a compound of formula I or a salt thereof EMI2.1 wherein RÚ is an optionally substituted aryl group and R is hydrogen, a salting ion or a sulphonyl ester forming group characterised in that a mono deprotonated methylene compound of the formula II EMI2.2 1 2 wherein R and R are as defined with respect to formula I and wherein any reactive groups may be protected, is reacted with carbon dioxide and thereafter optionally carrying out one or more of the following steps a converting a salt to the corresponding free acid or to a different salt 1 2 and b removing any protecting groups on R and R . Suitable aryl groups RÚ include an optionally substituted heteroaromatic ring containing one or two atoms selected from oxygen, sulphur and nitrogen, or an optionally substituted phenyl group. Suitable substituents for the heteroaromatic and the phenyl group include C16 alkyl, phenyl, halogen, C16 alkoxy, amino, nitro, hydroxy, C16 alkylamido, C1,6 alkylcarbonyloxy, carboxy, C16 alkoxycarbonyl, aralkyloxycarbonyl, halo C1 6 alkyl, C1 6 alkylcarbonyl, aryloxy, arylcarbonyl, C1,6 alkylsulphonyl C1,6 alkylamino, di Cl 6 alkylamino, cyano or thio. The amino, hydroxy, carboxy, C1 6 alkylamino, and thio groups are examples of substituents, for the heteroaromatic and the phenyl group which are normally protected prior to the process of the present invention. Suitable heteroaromatic ring systems include pyridyl, thienyl, furanyl and thiazole. Preferably the group R is phenyl, p hydroxyphenyl, p aminophenyl, 2 thienyl or 3 thienyl. Suitable sulphonyl ester forming groups R include those which may be converted to the free sulphonic acid subsequent to coupling the carboxylic acid I to a penicillin or cephalosporin nucleus. Aptly R2 is hydrogen or a C16 alkyl group such as, for example, methyl, ethyl, n or iso propyl, and n , sec , tert or iso butyl. R2 Preferably R2 is an ethyl or iso butyl group. The generation of the mono deprotonated methylene compound II and the subsequent reaction with carbon dioxide are conveniently carried out without intermediate isolation of the compound II . Suitable precursors for the mono deprotonated methylene compound II include a compound of formula III R1 CH2 SO3R2 III 1 2 wherein I and R are as defined hereinbefore with respect to formula I and wherein any reactive groups may be protected. The mono deprotonated methylene compound II may be generated from the compound III by reaction with strong base. Suitable bases for deprotonating compound III include alkyl Grignard reagents such as, for example, isopropylmagnesium bromide organolithium reagents such as methyl lithium, butyl lithium,phenyl lithium, and lithium naphthalene organosodium reagents such as sodium naphthalene and sodium phenanthrene and saline hydrides such as sodium hydride. The preferred base for deprotonating compound III is butyl lithium. Suitable solvents in which the deprotonation reaction and subsequent reaction with carbon dioxide may be performed will be aprotic such as, for example, diethylether, tetrahydrofuran, dimethylformamide, hexamethylphosphoramide and quinoline. The reactions are generally carried out at moderate to low temperatures ie in the range 100 C to 30 C. The course of the reaction may be followed by conventional methods such as thin layer chromatography and terminated when an optimum quantity of product is present in the reaction mixture. The mono deprotonated methylene compound II and the strong base base used in its generation are reactive materials and to ensure reasonable yields all reagents, solvents, apparatus and the carbon dioxide should be dried accordingly and the reactions are preferably performed in vacuo or under an inert atmosphere. Suitable apparatus and methods for performing the reactions are disclosed in D.F. Schriver, The Manipulation of AirSensitive Materials McGraw Hill Book Company, New York 1969. The starting material of formula III may be prepared by known literature methods, when R is phenyl.For example, compound III may be prepared by a process such as that disclosed in DE OS 2502912. A particularly useful method for preparing the starting material III wherein R1 is thienyl comprises the reaction of a thienylmethylhalide with a sulphite salt. Suitable thienylmethylhalides include 3 thienylmethylbromide and 2 thienylmethylchloride. A suitable sulphite salt for use in the above process is sodium sulphite. The thienylmethyl sulphonic acid salt obtained in the above process may be used directly in the process of the present invention, or may be esterified or converted to the free acid before use. A particularly suitable method for synthesising 3 thienylmethylsulphonic esters comprises reaction of the sodium salt of 3 thienylmethylsulphonic acid with an organic halide in the presence of silver tetrafluoroborate this method is particularly suitable for producing the C16 alkyl esters such as, for example the iso butyl ester.

A particularly suitable method for synthesising 2 thienylmethylsalphonic C1 6 alkyl esters comprises reaction of a tetraalkylammonium salt of 2 thienylmethyl sulphonic acid with a trialkyloxonium salt this method is particularily suitable for the thyl ester of 2 thienyl methyl sulphonic acid. The compounds of formula III wherein R1 is thienyl are novel intermediates and as such constitute a further aspect of this invention. The compounds of formula I produced by the process of the present invention have utility as intermediates in the preparation of penicillins and penicillin derivatives such as, for example, those described in British Patents Numbers 1530861 and 1277578, and European Patent Application Number 0015690 Al.The compounds of formula I produced by the process of the present invention are particularly useful as intermediates in the synthesis of a compound of formula IV or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or in vivo hydrolysable ester thereof EMI7.1 wherein R3is an optionally substituted 5 membered heterocyclic aromatic ring containing one or two heteroatoms selected from oxygen, sulphur andnnitrogen phenyl mono substituted phenyl where the substituent is halogen, hydroxy, C16 alkoxy, nitro, amino, C16 alkyl, C16 haloalkyl, C1 6 alkylcarbonyloxy, or C1 6 alkyl sulphonylamino for example NHS02CH3 or di substituted phenyl where the substituents are selected from hydroxy, halogen, methoxy, acetoxy and amino and R4is hydrogen or C16 alkyl.
