# EJECTOR UNIT FOR MACHINES FOR HANDLING SIGNATURES AND SIMILAR ARTICLES, PARTICULARLY FOR SIGNATURE STACKING MACHINES

## Abstract
An ejector unit for machines for handling signatures and similar flat articles S comprises a first rotary body 1 defining the output end of a conveyor 9 on which a substantially continuous flow of articles S to be handled is fed, a stop member 10 selectively orientable between a rest position E and operating position E in which the member stops the flow of articles S adjacent the output end of the conveyor, and two second rotary bodies 2a, 2b which can be rotated by the first rotary body 1 to carry out a shaping ribbing action on the articles handled 5 . At least one third rotary body 3 is interposed between the first rotary body 1 and one of the second rotary bodies 2a and is movable between a first operating position A in which the third rotary body 3 transmits rotary motion from the first rotary body 1 to the respective second rotary body 2a and a second operating position A in which the transmission of rotary movement between the first rotary body 1 and the second rotary body 2a is prevented. Actuator means 6 to 9, 12 to 15 are interposed between the stop member 10 and the third rotary body 3 and can cause the movement of the third rotary body 3 to the second operating position A when the stop member is oriented in its operating position E .
