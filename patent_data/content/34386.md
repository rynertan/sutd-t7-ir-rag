# Apparatus for carrying a person in sitting condition.

## Abstract
Apparatus for carrying a person in sitting condition, for use on the familiar patient lift Steel Nurse , known from the Dutch patent 110,348 as well as from the U.S.patent 3.694.829. This patient lift carries lamed or sick people by means of two supporting straps nrs. 18 and 24 of figure 2 moved upwardly by means of the hydraulic piston cylinder device nr.5 of figure 1 . The lower one of said straps nr.24 of figure 1 to be guided directly behind the knee hollows below the upper legs of the person to be carried, the upper strap nr. 18 of figure 2 to be guided behind the back of the person, under his arms. A disadvantage of this system, which has been encoun tered in practice, is that lamed patients tend to slide out of the upper strap. The invention aims at meeting this disadvantage. To achieve this, the said upper strap nr. 18 of figure 2 is hooked no longer on the free ends of a fixed horisontal cross bar, but on the free ends of the two revolving rods nrs. 12a and 12b of figure 1 . Said rods, revolving in an inclined plane, in the unloaded condition take a mutually spreaded position by means of a spring but in the carrying position of the apparatus, under influence of the forces then imparted thereto by the connected strap and patient, are moved towards each other, as figure 2 shows. In this way the strap is tensioned more strongly round the upper body of the patient, whereby the danger of sliding downwardly is opposed. Since said supporting rods nrs. 12a and 12b of figure 1 yield prog ressively under the weight of the patient, they tighten said strap in an improved manner around the upper body, as the weight of the carried person is larger. Preferably, the said revolving rods are coupled by gear sectors provided on their pivot axes. In this manner there is achieved that the said rods always carry out the same angle rotation, in spite of possible differences in the values of the forces imparted thereto by the body of the patient, so that any tendencies to a slanted sus pended position of the body are opposed. Figure 3 shows a blocking means for special cases in which it may be a disadvantage that the upper strap is ten sioned around the body of the patient, for instance when a special painfulness of the breast of the patient makes it impossible to bear the pressure.
