# Apparatus for treating molten metal and method for refining steel melts.

## Abstract
An apparatus for treating molten metal comprises a ladle and a hood 4 with a heat shield 6 which essentially covers the ladle completely, where a gap 9 is left between the heat shield and the upper edge 8 of the ladle. A screen 10 extends over and underneath the said gap so that a circumferential opening 16 is formed between the screen and the ladle underneath the gap, said circumferential opening defining an inlet opening for ambient air to a chamber 17 under said screen. At least one lance is provided for introducing at least gas into the melt in the ladle and or to the ladle chamber above the molten metal, and at least one exhaust pipe 18 communicates with the chamber 17 under the said screen for sucking out exhaust gases which pass from the ladle chamber 26 out into the said space 17 through the said gap 9 , and also air which is sucked from the ambient atmosphere into the said space 17 mainly through the circumferential opening 16 between the screen and the outside of the ladle. At least one aperture 19 22 is provided in the hood for at least one lance 23, 25 which can be lowered into the ladle chamber underneath the heat shield and or into the melt in the ladle. The apparatus makes it possible to refine steel melts for production of steel with extremely low oxygen content according to a method adapted to the apparatus.
