# Lubricant film coated magnetic disks.

## Abstract
Use of lubricant coated magnetic disks in a magnetic disk storage can alleviate the problems of head crashes and flying head slider wear. By arranging a lubricant evaporation source 10 ,20, 30 in an air tight enclosure 13 of the storage to fill the enclosure with lubricant vapour, evaporation and consumption of coated lubricant layers on the disks 1 is suppressed, to main tain the layers stable over long operating times. An evaporation surface of the lubricant evaporation source 10, 20, 30 can be arranged on an inside wall 7a of the enclosure, on a dummy disk surface 31 , or in a place exposed to circulating hot air flow 12 inside the enclosure 13 . A porous structure or rough surface structure for the source 10, 20, 30 is effective to accelerate evaporation of lubricant from the source and to provide strong adhesion of the lubricant material.
