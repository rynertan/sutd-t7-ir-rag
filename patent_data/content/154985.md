# ORGANOSILICON OXIRANE ADDITIVES FOR FILLED CONDENSATION POLYMER COMPOSITES

## Abstract
Combinations of oxirane compounds and acylamino or cyano silanes which are stable at room temperature when incorporated, either by integrally blending or pre treatment onto fillers, into filled condensation polymer systems pro duce superior composites exhibiting hydrolytic stability. These combinations make excellent one component ad ditives for inorganic fillers employed in filled condensation polymer systems.
