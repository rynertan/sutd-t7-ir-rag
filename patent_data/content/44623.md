## Description
SOLAR HEATING SYSTEMTECHNICAL FIELD This invention relates to a solar heating system and more particularly to such a system for incorporation in a building having a roof void, said building including a hot water system supplied with water from a cold water supply tank. BACKGROUND ART It is now well established practice to attempt to make use of the energy available from the sun to effect space and water heating particularly in domestic residences. For such purposes, translucent heat exchange panels are commonly incorporated in extents of the roofs of buildings on which solar radiation is incident, a heat exchange liquid, typically water or oil, being forced through tubes within said panels to be heated by the solar energy, said heated liquid then being used to effect or contribute towards the desired heating within the building. However, the panels, as well as the substantial auxiliary equipment normally associated therewith, such as liquid supply tanks, expansion tanks, flow control valves, temperature sensors and the like, are relatively complex and therefore expensive items, while the installation of such panes, particularly into preerected buildings, is a complicated and expensive procedure such as often to make the use of such panels uneconomical. Additionally, effective operation of the panels requires the forcing through the panels of a heat exchange liquid, with the attendant problems associated with extensive lengths of liquid carrying tubes in roof voids.DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION According to the present invention there is provided, for installation in a building having a roof void, said building including a hot water system fed from a cold water supply tank, a solar heating system comprising one or more translucent panels for incorporation in, to form at least part of the surface of, the roof of the building, heat exchange means for location in the cold water surly tank, said heat exchange means including a passageway therethrough, and means for forcing air from the upper regions of the roof void through the passageway in the heat exchange means and thence to the lower regions of the roof void, the arrangement being such that solar radiation transmitted through the or each translucent panel heats the air within the roof void, the heated air from the upper regions of the roof void forced through the heat exchange means serving to heat the water in the supply tank, said air then being returned to the lower regions of the roof void. In a preferred system, the or each translucent panel has associated therewith a further panel for location within the roof void to extend substantially parallel with the translucent panel whereby solar radiation transmitted through the translucent panel is incident on a surface of said further panel, said surface being matt black. Such a system maximises utilisation of the available solar radiation in that said radiation is absorbed by the matt black further panels to heat said panels and is therefore available in relatively concentrated areas to heat air in the roof void. When installed in a tiled roof, the translucent panels may be of size and shape conforming with that of the roof tiles. Alternatively, a single translucent panel may extend over an area equivalent to that of a plurality of said roof tiles. Conveniently the heat exchange means comprises an inlet chamber and an outlet chamber interconnected by a plurality of preferably parallel tubes whereby air forced into the inlet chamber flows to the outlet chamber along said tubes. The system preferably includes a first length of tubing for interconnecting the upper regions of the roof void with an inlet to the heat exchange means and a further length of tubing for extending from an outlet from the heat exchange means to the lower regions of the roof void. The means for forcing air through the heat exchange means conveniently comprises an electric fan which may be located to the outlet side of the heat exchange means or, alternatively, said fan may be located to the inlet side of the heat exchange means to blow air through said heat exchange means. A preferred system incorporates a pair of temperature sensors, one for monitoring the temperature in the upper regions of the roof void and the other for monitoring the temperature of the water in the supply tank, said sensors being interconnected with the fan in such a manner that said fan is actuated only when the temperature at the one sensor is greater than the temperature at the other sensor by at least a predetermined minimum amount. The system may include a vent for location in the roof of the building and arranged to open, thereby to vent the roof void to the outside, when the temperature in the roof void reaches a predetermined maximum value as may occur, for example, on failure of the fan or in extremely hot weather conditions. Conveniently such a vent is hydraulically operated, relying on expansion of the hydraulic fluid to effect operation of the vent at the desired temperature.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Fig. 1 shows schematically a solar heating system according to the invention in a roof void, and Fig. 2is a plan view of the heat exchange means of the system of Fig. 1.BEST MODE OF CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION Referring to the drawings, there is shown part of a building, typically a domestic residence, having a roof 2 defining therein a roof void 4. Housed within the roof void 4 is a cold water supply tank 6 supplying water to the hot water storage tank of a conventional domestic hot water system. A translucent panel 8, which may be of, for example, clear fibreglass or wire reinforced glass, is located in, to form part of, an extent of the roof 2 on which solar radiation is incident, whereby said solar radiation incident on the panel 8 is transmitted through said panel into the roof void 4. The panel 8 may consist of a number of smaller, interconnected translucent members and, in the case of a tiled roof, said smaller members may each be the same size and shape as the roof tiles whereby they can be installed in the roof in the conventional manner of said roof tiles. If the conventional tiles are supported on a weatherproof lining sheet, this sheet, at least in the region of the translucent tiles, will itself be of a translucent material. Located within the roof void 4 to extend substantially parallel with the panel 8 at a small distance therefrom typically 25cms is a flat panel 10, at least the surface of said panel 10 facing outwardly of the void 4 being matt black. The material of said panel must be capable of withstanding high temperatures typically of the order of 1000C and may be, for example, fibreglass cloth or a suitable plastics material. It will be appreciated that solar radiation transmitted through the panel 8 is absorbed by the matt black panel 10 whereby said panel 10 is heated, said heat then being radiated from the panel 10 to increase the temperature of the air within the roof void 4. Further, the volume between the panels 8 and 10 is heated to substantial temperatures by virtue of reflection and re radiation of part of the incident energy, in accordance with the green house effect. In order to make as full use as possible of the radiation transmitted into the void through the panel 8, the roof timbers and other constructional components within the void 4 are also painted matt black. A heat exchanger indicated generally at 12 is positioned in the lower regions of the cold water supply tank 6, said exchanger comprising an inlet chamber 14 and an outlet chamber 16 interconnected by a plurality of parallel tubes 18 each communicating into both the chambers 14,16. The material of the heat exchanger is conveniently copper. A first length of flexible reinforced plastic hose 20 extends from the upper regions of the roof void 4 to an inlet to the chamber 14, while a further length of such hose 22 extends from an outlet from the chamber 16 to the lower regions of the void 4.An electric fan 24, preferably a centrifugal blower fan, is positioned in the hose 22 outside the tank 6 as seen in Fig. 1. On actuation of the fan 24 to draw air through the heat exchanger 12, heated air from the upper regions of the void 4 is drawn through the hose 20, through the heat exchanger 12 to be vented back into the lower regions of the roof void from the hose 220 As the heated air travels from the inlet chamber 14 to the outlet chamber 16 of the heat exchanger 12 along the parallel tubes 18, heat from the air is conducted through the walls of said tubes to heat the water in the tank 6, which tank should be well insulated, the cooled air then being drawn through the hose 22 and returned to the roof void 4. Thus it will be appreciated that, on demand from the hot water storage tank, pre heated water is supplied thereto from the tank 6. The specific heat of air is so much lower than that of liquids, such as water, that air has not normally been considered an economical heat transferring medium. However, the substantial volume of air within a typical, well insulated roof void, once heated in the manner detailed above, has a very high calorific value. The fan 24 can be arranged to pump air through the illustrated system incorporating hose of typically 8cms diameter at a typical rate of between 150 and 300 metres per minute, this high rate of flow being accommodated in the heat exchanger 12 by virtue of the many tubes 18 interconnecting the inlet and outlet chambers 14,16, which tubes are typically between 3cms and 5cms in diameter. Temperatures in the roof void in excess of 600 C can readily be achieved even in the North of England in May, and up to 10 kilowatts of energy per day supplied to the water in the tank 6, which water can be heated to a temperature of the order of 400C. Thus it will be appreciated that large volumes of warm water can be provided by means of the system of the invention conveniently the tanks 6 are of the order of 300 to 450 litres in capacity. If preferred, two or more smaller tanks 6 may be used, each typically of 225 litre capacity, there being one or more fans 24 associated with each tank 6. As mentioned above, the tank s 6 should be well insulated so that the heated water therein can retain its heat content overnight. In a preferred system, a pair of temperature sensors 26,28 are provided, one in the upper regions of the roof void 4 and one in the supply tank 6, said sensors being linked to the fan 24 in such a manner that said fan is actuated only when the temperature at the sensor 26 is greater than the temperature at the sensor 28 by at least a predetermined minimum amount, typically at least 300 to 40C. Should the fan 24 fail or should the external weather conditions be extreme, the temperature in the roof void may rise to unacceptable levels. A vent 30 may therefore be provided in the roof, said vent being arranged to open when the temperature in the roof void reaches a predetermined maximum allowable value. Conveniently the vent is hydraulically operated, relying on expansion of the hydraulic fluid of the actuating mechanism to operate the vent at the desired temperature. Although the fan 24 is shown to the outlet side of the heat exchanger 12 and therefore draws cooled air therethrough, which air serves to cool the fan 24, said fan may be located in the hose 20 to the inlet side of the exchanger 12 to force, rather than draw, air through said exchanger. Clearly the system of the invention has application in industrial as well as domestic situations, while the rates of air flow and associated specifications can be chosen to suit particular requirements.However, in all systems, it will be appreciated that a substantial amount of heat energy is available at very little cost, while the relative simplicity of the system enables it to be readily incorporated in existing or in new buildings without the necessity for much structural alteration to the basic building.
