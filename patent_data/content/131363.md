# Polypeptide and protein products, and processes for their production and use.

## Abstract
A process for the production of a fusion protein compris ing an active portion of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase CAT protein and apolypeptide. The fusion protein may be purified using CAT substrate affinity chromatography. The eucaryotic polypeptide may be calcitonin or a derivative thereof such as calcitonin glycine. Other polypeptides described include enzymes such as chymosin, prochymosin and preprochymosin, hormones such as ACTH, insulins, and growth hormones and antigenic polypeptides such as foot and mouth disease virus antigenic polypeptide. The fusion protein may be cleaved at a site susceptible to selective enzymic or chemical cleavage to produce free polypeptide. The fusion protein may be used as an immunogen.
