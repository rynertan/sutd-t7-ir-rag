# A NOVEL LIPASE

## Abstract
The lipase is a novel microbiological enzymatic product produced by Ps. fragi 22.39B and has relatively high activity in an alkaline condition with an optimum pH of 9.0 and an optimum temperature of 65 to 70 C. The lipase is active for the decomposition of not only fatty acid triglycerides, oils and fats, but also low molecular monoesters such as methyl oleate and butyl oleate as well as water soluble esters such as polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters.
