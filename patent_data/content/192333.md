# Induction heating vessels.

## Abstract
An induction heating vessel such as a cooking utensil for use with an induction cooker has a wall formed by a first layer including a magnetic metal 20 which is capable of being inductively heated, and a second layer which includes a ply of aluminum 31, 32 and or a ply of copper 30 , this second layer being in intimate thermally conducting contact with the first layer and being located interiorly of the utensil with respect of the first layer. The first layer may comprise a ply 20 of carbon sheet located between two plies 22 of stainless steel. To deter corrosion of the carbon steel 20 at the edge of the vessel, the circumferential edge of the utensil can be covered by a stainless steel ring 54 which encloses a metal 31 which, in the galvanic series, is sacrificial with respect to the carbon steel 20 .
