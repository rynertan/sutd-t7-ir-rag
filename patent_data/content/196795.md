# Apparatus for fusion joining of thermoplastic pipes.

## Abstract
The apparatus increases the hydraulic pressure in rams 16 until one pipe moves towards a heater plate 14. The movement is detected by a limit switch 26 and a micro processor based control system 28 adds a pre programmed value of pressure to that pressure which caused the move ment drag pressure . The total pressure is applied to force the pipe ends against a heater plate 14 to form end beads bead up . After heating for a pre programmed period the control system automatically initiates plate retraction and forces the pipe ends together fusion for another program med period. The applied pressure is the sum of the recorded drag pressure and a pre programmed added pressure. Operator judgement of bead size, pressures and time periods is eliminated. Pressurised fluid is supplied to the rams 16 from a pump and accumulator combination. The sense of ram motion is determined by changeover valves controlled by the control system 28.
