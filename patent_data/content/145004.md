# Bipolar Transistor Field Effect Transistor Composite Circuit.

## Abstract
A bipolar transistor complementary field effect transis tor composite circuit for performing the same logic function as that of a complementary field effect transistor logic circuit, comprises a first bipolar transistor 11 having a collector C of one conductivity type connected to a first potential V The composite circuit has a fourth field effect transistor circuit 51 of the one conductivity type connected between the base B of the second bipolar transistor 12 and the second potential GND to respond to an output of the complementary field effect transistor circuit constructed by the first field effect transistor circuit 21 and the second field effect transistor circuit 41 . The same input V
