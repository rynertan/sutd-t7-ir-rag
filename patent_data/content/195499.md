# Making of a steel component by nitriding.

## Abstract
A component formed of interstitial free steel is heated in a gaseous atmosphere containing 15 by volume of a nitrogen doner, e.g. ammonia, at about 500 C to about 740 C for about 30 minutes to about 4 hours to form an epsilon iron nitride surface layer, and a layer of nitrides of trace alloying elements below the surface layer.
