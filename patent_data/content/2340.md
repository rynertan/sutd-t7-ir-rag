# Glass concentrate capsules for reinforcement of thermoplastics and their preparation.

## Abstract
Disclosed herein are glass concentrate capsules useful in forming reinforced thermoplastic resin composites, said capsules comprising 50 to 90 by weight of glass strands having a length of from about 0.80 to about 20 mm which strands are arranged in a substantially collimated array within a low molecular weight crystalline organic material, wherein the individual strands in the collimated array and the collimated array of glass strands are encapsulated in the low molecular weight crystalline organic material.
