# Adhesive compositions.

## Abstract
Adhesive compositions, which comprise A a polyester polyol, polyester polyurethene polyol or their mixture, B a silane coupling agent, C a vinyl chloride copolymerization resin, D a diene synthetic rubber and E an organic polyisocyanate. The adhesive compositions can be used as adhesives for plastic films, such as nylon, tetron and polyolefins, alumi num foil, etc., and offers particularly excellent adhesion toward metaliized films, whereby the resultant bonded films, even when boiled in an alkali or acid atmosphere, remain free from discoloration or disappearance in the metallized layers.
