# Improved conductive resinous composites.

## Abstract
Resinous compositions are generally metal filled and also contain hard filler materials. This combination produces unexpectedly better electrical conductivity than metal filled material without the hard filler materials. Meanwhile there can be retained the resinous composition s ability to be quickly fabricated by simple molding technique into structu rally sound rigid articles which are electrically conductive.
