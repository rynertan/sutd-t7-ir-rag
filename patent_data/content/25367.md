# Filter connector.

## Abstract
Filter connector having a compound filter with two filter elements 20,22 connected in cascade in the cooperating filter contact, separate ground plates being provided for the respective filter elements 20, 22 , and each filter element 20 22 such as a pi section filter, being provided with an electrode arrangement which facilitates connection of the filter elements 20,22 in cascade and minimizes susceptibility to flash over between electrodes. In fact, each filter element 20 22 comprises a center conductor 74 with a dielectric sleeve 100 100 coaxially thereof a ground electrode 80 80 disposed on the external surface of the sleeve 100 100 a first active electrode 78 78 extending from the internal surface to the external surface of the sleeve 100 100 over one end surface thereof and a second active electrode 82 82 extending from the internal surface to the external surface of the sleeve 100 100 over the other end surface thereof, the marginal space between the first active electrode 78 78 and the ground electrode 80 80 on the external surface of the sleeve 100 100 being coated with a dielectric material 108 108 and, similarly, the marginal space between the second active electrode 82 82 and the ground electrode 80 80 being coated with a dielectric material 116 116 .
