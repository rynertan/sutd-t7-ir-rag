## Description
METHOD OF CONTROLLING TOOL POSITIONS IN A CORRUGATED BOARD CONTAINER MAKING PLANT This invention relates to a method of controlling tool positions in a corrugated board container making plant in which delicate adjustments are required for various tools depending on the various conditions such as type and thickness of corrugated boards and type and size of containers to be made from sheet material of such corrugated boards. In the processing of sheet material of corrugated board, several steps or tools are required to make a final container.These tools may be feeders, printers, slitter scorers, slotters, folder gluers, and so on. In this specification, however, the term tool is used to describe any kind of mechanical control element as well as the noted tools.Each of the tools is threadedly carried on a shaft which in turn is connected to an electrical actuator so that the tool on the shaft can be adjustably positioned for its individual operation. In a typical plant, containers of various shape are made to order, and this factor considerably adds to the adjustment positions in the respective tools as well as the parameters which must be inputted to position the respective tools in conformity with a selected size of container. In a slotter for example, grooving knives have to be positioned to an order specification. Additionally, there are other factors to be considered. In a printer for example, the printing condition varies substantially with the thickness of the printing plate and or the difference in thickness due to possible wear of the printing plate and hence, printing gaps between pressure rollers must be varied. Further, corrugated boards are classified by the type of flutes forming such boards which may be either A flute, B flute or AB flute according to the Japanese Industrial Standards. In a folder gluer, the position and or the lateral gaps of folding bars have to be strictly adjusted due to possible variations in thickness of the respective type of flutes. Failure to effect the adjustment will result in differences in dimensions when corrugated board sheets are folded. For these reasons, therefore, with only a uniform calculation formula based on the size of containers, accurate command values for positioning the respective tools were not be obtained. Practically, the operator had to position the tools by calculating positioning data and by manually setting the control on the basis of the specification described in the order slip, along with his experience and sense. It is, therefore, the primary object of the invention to provide an improved method of controlling tool positions in a corrugated board container making plant by which tool positions may be readily adjusted to the specification of containers to be made. It is another object of the present invention to provide such method in which tool positioning data corresponding to the specifications of various containers is stored in a computer provided in a suitable environment isolated from the plant and connected on line with a control in the plant. In accordance with the present invention there is provided, as schematically shown in Figure 1, a method of controlling tool positions in a plant 1 for making corrugated board containers, of the type wherein tool positions 2 are adjusted by a plurality of electric actuators 3 in conformance with specifications of a corrugated board container to be made, the electric actuators being controlled by an electric control 4 located in the plant. The inventive method comprises the steps of providing a computer 6 in a suitable environment isolated from the plant, the computer being electrically connected to the elctric control 4 in the plant through a communication line 5 storing in the computer tool positioning data corresponding to the specifications of a corrugated board container te be made in making the container, reading out from the computer the tool positioning data corresponding to the specifications of the container and adjusting the respective tool positions 2 automatically through the control 4 on the basis of the data transferred from the computer 6.In accordance with a more limited aspect of the invention, the method further comprises, during operation after the adjusting step, effecting minute correction of the adjusted tool positions, and rewritingxthe data stored in the computer on the basis of the corrected tool positioning data. The invention will now be described by way of example and with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a symbolic diagram showing the general arrangement of the invention Figure 2 is a schematic diagram showing a preferred embodiment of the invention and Figure 3 is a flow chart of the invention. Referring to Figure 2, there is shown in schematic form several components used in conjunction with the present invention. A corrugated board container making plant 7 is shown as comprising a plurality of electric acturators or pulse motors 8 which are controlled by a plurality of tool position control units PCU1 PCUn. Each of the pulse motors 8 is connected to a threaded shaft 9 on which is threadedly carried a toal block 10. Thus, the block 10 is reciprocated through the pulse motor 8 so as to shift its position relative to a scale 11. Reference numeral 12 designates a position sensor or pulse generator which is adapted to sense tool positions. Also, reference numeral 13 designates a proximity switch which is adapted to sense the block 10 being returned to its original position. Thus, all of these components, the tool position control units PCU1 PCUn, pulse motors 8, pulse generators 12 and proximity switches 13, are interrelated to form automatic positioning means 14 for the blocks 10 to which the respective tools are operatively mounted. The tool position control units PCU1 PCUn are connected to a central control 15 with a CRT and a keyboard for transferring tool positioning data in a serial parallel conversion mode. The control 15 is connected on line with a large computer 18 installed in an optimal environment or office 17 through modems 16 and a communication line. The following opetations are performed in the system thus arranged. As shown in Figure 3, to deal with an order of which the tool positioning data have been stored in the computer 18 of the office 17, the communication line is activated from the control 15 side so as to designate the corresponding order number. Then, a corresponding command for adjusting tool positions is transmitted from the computer 17 to the central control 15. After receiving the command, the lines are activated between the control 15 and the tool position control units PCU1 PCUn to transmit the data from the computer 18, so that the tool position control unitsPCU1 PCUn are operated to adjust the respective tool positions in accordance with the command. Upon completion of this positioning operation, fine manual adjustments are conducted for the respective tool positions while making a few containers on trial.Thereafter, the lines between the tool position control units PCU1 PCUn and the control 15 is activated to transmit to the control 15 corrected tool positioning data representative of the fine adjustments. Then, the communication line is activated between the control 15 and the computer 18 so as to rewrite the data in the computer 18 on the basis of the corrected tool positioning data. Thus, in the event that the same order number is used to deal with subsequent orders, only the order number is designated to the computer 18 through the control 15, then, the corrected data previously recorded will be given from the computer 18 as a command. At this time, fine adjustments are not necessary after automatic tool positioning, thereby extremely facilitating tool positioning operation i the shop. It is to be noted that a large capacity external memory 19 may be connected to the control 15 and thus, without providing the computer 18, substantially equal effect may be obtained. Further, additional data such as order quantity, production time, and downtime of the machine may be transmitted, at the same time when corrected data is fed back to the computer 18 from the control 15, so that the whole plant may be automated with the optimum efficiency in operation.
