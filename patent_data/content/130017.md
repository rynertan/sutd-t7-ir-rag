# Electrical connector for trilead cable and method of assembly thereof.

## Abstract
A dielectric housing 20 has signal and ground terminals 22, 24 secured with contact sections aligned with openings 48, 54 at a front end into which a pin 14 and a ground rail 18 of a panelboard 16 extend. Termination sections for the signal and ground conductors 34, 32, 38 of the signal and ground terminal members 22, 24 are rearward of the contact sections. A cable securing section 114 is part of either the signal or ground terminal member 22, 24 for cable strain relief. Cover members 26, 28 are latchably secured to member 20 over the termination sections and serve as added cable strain relief. Alternatively, dielectric cover material 320 may be moulded around the terminals 222, 224 leaving exposed intermediate and contact sections of the terminals 222, 224 , and the assembly inserted into a housing member 220 . Openings are provided for an electrical probe 152 .
