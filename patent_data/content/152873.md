# Paper feed control in a printer.

## Abstract
A paper feed Control system in a printer allows two types of manual paper feed operation. In a first type of ma nual paper feed operation, a course manual paper feed is conducted while an electrical detent operation is conducted by a paper feed drive pulse motor 1 . In a second type of manual paper feed operation, a fine adjustment of the paper position is carried out while the electrical detent operation is precluded. A counter system 12 is associated with the rotation of the paper feed drive pulse motor 1 so as to pro vide the electrical detent operation at preselected positions. When the second type of manual paper feed operation is completed, the counter system 12 is reset so that the sub sequent electrical detent operation is carried out with refer ence to the finely adjusted paper position.
