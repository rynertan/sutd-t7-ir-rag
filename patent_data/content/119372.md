## Description
Convs4in device using a number of rollers TCHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a conveying device and particularly to such a conveying device which uses a number of rollers which are intended to facilitate the conveyance of a rigid material An initial number of rollers intended for conveyance of the material is orientated for interaction with one edge portion of the material whilst a second number of rollers intended for conveyance of the material is orientated for interaction with the other, opposite edge portion of the material.The rigidity of the material is preferably so selected that the material can be conveyed with support, in the form of point support from the rollers, only at the edge portions.BACKGROUND Conveying devices of the type described above are previously known in a variety of embodiments and a conveying device appertains to the state of the art where a plurality of rollers are arranged on one and the same axis and where the peripheral surface of the rollers functions as a support for the material. The axes of rotation of the rollers are here orientated in parallel with a plane assigned to the material and the. direction of conveyance of the material. Conveying devices are also already knowu where the rollers are integrated into a roll stand and where the end portions of the respective roll are given an outwardly expanded conical shape so that b7 this means the material can be centred to the centre portions of the rolls. DISRUPTION OF nHS TION Tr CHNICAL PR03LES Conveying devices of the type described above have given rise to problems during their operation. Thus it has proved difRicz t to convey raterial at high speeds, because at these high speeds the material exhibits an excessively strong tendency to oscillate between the end portions of the rolls. It is t difficult technical problem to create a conveying device using a number of rollers which are so designed that they permit high conveying speeds for the material intended for conveyance. It is a difficult technical problem to create a conveying device using a number of rollers which are so designed that the minimum possible portion of the material comes into contact with the conveying device, and particularly in the case when the material intended for conveyance has been snrface treated prior to reaching the conveying device it is a prerequisite that in order not to destroy the surface treatment of the material it should make the most limited contact possible with the actual conveying device. It has furthermore proved to be a difficult technical problem to create a conveying device which is so designed that firstly different drive speeds can be assigned to it, but which above all can impart rapid acceleration and or rapid retardation of speed to the material. It is obvious that the acceleration and or retardation problem becomes particularly difficult if the requirement is to be complied with that the conveying device should interact with the material to the least possible extent. It has proved to be a difficult technical problem to create a roller which can be employed in a conveying device of the type descrited above, and which is so designed that on the one hand it can function as a guide for material, and secondly exhibit the advantage that, viewed practically, it needs to interact with the material only at one point. Furthermore it has proved to be a difficult technical problem to drive the rollers with the aid of a drive belt and where pouer transmission between the drive belt and the roller takes place in a simple manner and where tensioning rollers can be provided for guiding the drive belt so that it interacts with all rollers, and where the tensioning rollers in addition ensure, by virtue of their location, that each roller exhibits a small contact angle in relation to the drive belt. Fhrthermore it is a difficult technical problem to create conditions such that some rollers are driven by solely an initial drive motor and that some rollers are driven by solely a second drive motor, etc., so that by this means the drive motors can be driven mutually at different speeds. THE SOLUTION The present invention now proposes a conveying device using a nunber of rollers where these rollers are intended to be able to convey rigid material and where an initial number of rollers designed to convey the material are orientated for interaction with one edge portion of the material whilst a second number of rollers designed to convey the material are orientated for interact on with the other, opposite edge portion, of the material. The rigidity of the material should be so selected that the material can be conveyed with support solely at the edge portions. Nevertheless it is obvious that if the material rigidity isnot sufficient to permit such conveyance, supporting rollers can be provided underneath the material, With a view to solving the problems outlined above, the present invention proposes that the respective rollers be arranged in such a way that their axis of rotation forms a right angle or essentially a right angle in respect of a plane assigned to the material and that the respective roller should exhibit an oblique surface which functions as supporting surface for an edge which forms part of one and or other edge portion of the material. The invention proposes that the respective roller should have an upper cylindrical surface and a lower surface designed as a truncated cone and that the angle between the conical surface and the axis of rotation should be selected to be around 300. The invention proposes that all rollers should be driven by one and the same drive source by means of a single drive belt and that a number of tensioning rollers are provided to guide the drive belt for interaction with all rollers. By virtue of their location the tensioning rollers ensure that each roller exhibits a contact angle in relation to the drive belt. This contact angle can be narrow, but should preferably be selected so as to exceed 5 . Furthermore it is proposed that some rollers should be driven by only an initial drive motor and other rollers should be driven by only a second drive motor, etc., by means of which different speeds can be assigned to the drive motors mutually, thus ensuring the possibility of obtaining rapid acceleration and or retardation of the speed of the material With the intention of being able to convey material above certain rollers it is proposed that these be capable of being louered underneath the material and furthermore that the axis of rotation for such lowering be orientated through the drive belt so as to ensure that the lowering or twisting downwards do not cause any change in the length of the drive belt. BDVBNTAGZS The advantages which can be regarded as being linked with a conveying device using a number of rollers in accordance with the present invention are firstly that a high acceleration and or retardation can be imparted to the material, whilst at the same time facilities are provided te convey material without large surface portions of the conveying device interacting with the material, in that here interaction takes place between drive rollers and the material only at points and particularly at an edge which forms part of one and or other edge portion of the material. The particular characteristic features of a conveying device in accordance with the present invention are outlined in the characteristic portion of patent claim 1 which follows. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS A proposed embodiment of a conveying device using a number of rollers in accordance with the present invention will be described in greater detail by reference to the appended drawings where Fig. 1 shows a horizontal vieu of the conveying device with a material intended for conveyance, Fig. 2 . shows on a somewhat enlarged scale a portion of the conveying device and Fig. 3 shows a section 111 111 in Fig. 1. DESCRIPTION OF PROPOSED EMBODIMENTS Thus Fig. 1 gives a horizontal view of a conveying device 1 in accordance with the present invention where the conveying device uses a number of drive rollers designed to convey a rigid material 2, indicated by dashed lines in Fig. 1. An initial number of rollers designed to convey the material, designated 3a 3e, is orientated for interaction with one edge portion 2a of the material whilst a second number of rollers designed for conveying the material 2, designated 4a 4e, is orientated for interaction with the other, opposite edge portion 2b of the material. The rigidity of the material 2 is preferably so selected that the material 2 can be conveyed with support solely at the edge portions 2a and 2b. If however the material rigidity should be reduced, then naturally it should be possible to provide supporting rollers. The respective rollers 3a 3e and 4a........4e are arranged so that their axis of rotation forms a right angle or essentially a right angle in respect of a plane assigned to the material and the respective rollers exhibit an oblique surface which functions as supporting surface for an edge which forms part of one and or other edge portion of the material. The embodiment in accordance with Fig. 1 shows that a drive belt 5 is driven by a motor 6 in a rotational direction and at a speed designated R1n and by this means the belt 5 assigns such a rotational direction and speed to all the rollers that the material 2 can be conveyed in the direction T . As a result all rollers are driven by one and the same drivesource 6 and by means of a single drive belt 5. A number of tensicning rollers 7a, 7b, 7c and 7d are provided to guide the drive belt 5 so that this interacts with all rollers. By virtue of their location the tensioning rollers 7a 7d ensure that each drive roller exhibits a contact angle in respect of the drive belt.This contact angle has been designated b in Fig. 2 and it is known that a functional conveying device is obtained even if the contact angle is small. For practical reasons however it is proposed that the contact angle be selected to exceed Fig. 1 indicates however that some rollers 3a.......3e and 4a.......4e are driven by solely an initial drive motor 6 and that some rollers 8a Sg and 9a 9g qa.......9g are driven solely by a second drive motor 10, the latter having a rotational direction and speed indicated by the notation uR2u. The drive motors 6 and 10 can with advantage be mutually driven at different speeds.Drive motor 10 drives a drive belt 11 which in a manner similar to drive belt 5 interacts with a numbed of tensioning rollers, designated as 12a, 12b, 12c, 12d and 12e. By selecting the drive motors 6 and 10 so that they have mutually differing speeds, it has proved to be possible to impart rapid acceleration and or retardation to the material 2 and even so retain the orientation of the material 2 in relation to the conveying device for example, high speed for motor 6 and low speed for motor 10 during rstardtion . Certain rollers, i.e. 8f, 8g and 9f, 9g together with the tensioning roller 12e can be inade capable of being lowered or twisted dowaaards underneath the conveyance path for the material 2 so as not to interfere with conveyance of materia across these rollers. In such cases it is proposed that the axis of rotation 13 be orientated through the drive belt 11 so that by this meas the lowering does not cause any change in the length of the drove belt 11. Fig. 2 shows on a some . iat enlarged scale a portion of the conveying device illustrated in Fig. t. Fig. 2 is intended to illustrate that the edge portion 2a of the material rests only at certain points against the rollers 3a, 3b and 3c, the points being designated as 14, 15 and 16. With reference to Fig. 3, one of the rollers is illustrated used in a conveying device in accordance with Fig. 1, i.e. the roller 3d. lii rollers are identical and by this means the respective roller is so arranged that its axis of rotation 3d forms a right angle or essentially a right angle in respect of plane 2c assigned to the material 2. Furthermore the respective roller 3d has an oblique surface 17 which functions as supporting surface for an edge 2a forming part of one 2a and or other edge portion of the material 2. Each roller has an upper cylindrical surface 18 and underlying surface 17 formed as a truncated cone, together with a groove underneath this 19 which is intended to interact with the drive belt 5. Concerning the angle nan between the conical surface 17 and the axis of rotation 3d it can be mentioned, particularly with reference to the diagram of forces shown in conjunction with Fig. 3, that an angle a somewhat less than 900 will give a small normal force N and anall force component F2 . It is likely that an angle a Just below 900 will not be capable of stabilising the material to the centre region between roller 3d and 4d. If on the other hand the angle wan is made snall, this certainly signifies that the normal force 5N will be large, but also that the force component WF2 will be large. The force component F2 tends to make the material bend, which is undesirable.A high normal force is as such desirable, since this gives a greater frictional force. During the practical application of the present invention it is hence important that the angle a be selected to take into account the choice of material and other circumstances. Practical tests heve indicated that the angle between the conical surface and the axis of rotation should be around 300 200 450 . The distance between roller 3d and roller 4d should be such that when the edge surface 2a of the material rests against the cylindrical surface 18, the edge surface 2b will continue to make contact with the surface 77 of roller 4d. The advantage of orientating the axis of rotation 3d in the manner proposed in the present invention is that the force which is transmitted from the drive rollers to the material 2 is directed solely in the direction of conveyance T and not at right angles thereto, so that centring of the material 2 between the surfaces 18 and 18 can occur even at high speeds. The present description indicates that if prior to reaching the conveying device 1 the material 2 has been subjected to surface treatment, on one or both sides, the material can be conveyed by the conveying device without the treated surfaces being contacted. The conveying device has proved to be particularly advantageous for the conveyance of cards having printed circuits. Obviously the invention is not restricted to the embodiment described above by way of example but can be subjected to modifications within the franiework of the following patent claims.
