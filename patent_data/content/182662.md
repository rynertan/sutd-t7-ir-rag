# SPACE DIVIDER SYSTEM

## Abstract
A space divider system utilizes horizontally extending beams mounted on height adjustable legs. The system in cludes main beams 10 on which are two enclosed wire raceways 17, 18 at substantially work surface height. Also included are stabilizer beams 20, 21, 22 which may be attached to their inner ends to any point along the main beam between the legs. The outer ends of the stabilizer beams are connected to a relatively short transverse beam 24 which includes height adjustable posts or legs 25, 26 at each end. The outer end of the stabilizer beam may optionally be con nected to the center of the transverse beam or to either leg or to a leg alone to form a T, I or L shape configuration. The stabilizer beam and transverse beam have the same con figuration and may support work surfaces or other com ponents. Work surfaces such as table tops may also be sup ported from the legs at the ends of the transverse beams. The stabilizer beam is at a lower elevation than the main beam and when cantilever tops are employed the space between the tops above the beam may be provided with wire manage ment trays. Also, posts may project upwardly from the sta bilizer beam in turn supporting rails so that sound and visual pads may extend upwardly, and that upper components may also be supported.
