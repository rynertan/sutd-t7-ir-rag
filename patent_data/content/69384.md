# Image scanning device.

## Abstract
In an image scanning system the main scanning is carried out by deflecting a scanning light beam across a recording sheet material 1 and the sub scanning is carried out by moving the recording sheet material in the direction perpendicular to the main scanning direction. The system includes a sub scanning drum 11 adapted to be continuous ly rotated to feed the recording sheet material 1 in the sub scanning direction which is perpendicular to the rota tional axis of the drum, a main scanning system for scanning a light beam across the recording sheet material 1 in the direction of the rotational axis of the sub scanning drum, a pair of nip rolls 12, 13 movable between a first position in which they are pressed against the drum 11 and a second position in which they are removed therefrom, a stopper 16 which is disposed downstream the drum 11 and the nip rolls 12, 13 with respect to the feeding path of the sheet material and is movable into and away from the feeding path, and a sheet discharging means 21 . The recording sheet material is fed toward the stopper 16 which is in the feeding path and is supported thereon in the unstrained state. Then the nip rolls 12, 13 are pressed against the rotating drum 11 sandwiching the recording sheet material therebetween and at the same time the stopper 16 is retracted away from the sheet, whereby the sheet is moved in the sub scanning direction. The sheet discharging means 21 is arranged not to act on the sheet while the scanning is effected.
