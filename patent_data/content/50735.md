# Zinc oxide varistor and method for providing such varistor.

## Abstract
A high voltage varistor for DC operation is manufactured by applying a glass collar to the perimeter of a sintered zinc oxide disc and heat treated between about 750 C and 400 C for several cycles in air. After heat treating, an organic resin or ceramic coating is applied to the glass collar to further insulate the varistor for high voltage application.
