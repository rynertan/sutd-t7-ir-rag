# A method for recovering precious metals.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method for pyrometallurgical ly recovering the precious metal content, such as gold, silver and platinum metals, of halogen bearing materials rich in silver. The material is caused to rapidly disperse in or be finely distributed throughout an at least partially molten charge containing a non oxidic metal containing phase having the ability to dissolve precious metals and to substantially lower their chemical activity. The halogen content of the material herewith reacts with any fluxes or metals of high chemical activity present in the furnace charge, while forming metal halogenides. The halogenides formed are separated by slagging and or volatilization, and the precious metals are recovered from the molten charge, depleted of halogens, in a conventional manner and with regard to the charge phases.
