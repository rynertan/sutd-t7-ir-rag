# Process for recovery of an aliphatic diol oligomerization solvent.

## Abstract
Recovery of aliphatic diol solvent in a process wherein ethylene is oligomerized by contact with a solution of a nickel complex catalyst in the solvent to afford a reaction product made up of a a liquid solvent phase containing dissolved catalyst, b a liquid hydrocarbon phase comprising ethylene oligomers containing dissolved ethylene, catalyst and solvent and c gaseous ethylene, the reaction product is separated into gaseous ethylene and diol solvent containing dissolved catalyst, a substantial portion of the separated solvent is recy cled to the oligomerization zone and a minor portion of the separated solvent is fractionated to remove light ends and spent catalyst prior to reuse in the process, the formation of diol solvent degradation products in the diol solvent fractio nation step being avoided by adding a minor amount of an alkali metal hydroxide to the fractionation zone.
