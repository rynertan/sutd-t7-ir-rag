# Method and unit for mounting an array of mirrors of the SSM Second surface mirror type on a panel of a spacecraft.

## Abstract
An array of mirrors of the SSM Second Surface Mir ror type is fixed to the outer surface of a panel 6 of a spacecraft, for example an artificial satellite, for the purpose of heat control. The fixing of the mirrors to the panel is achieved by gluing in a series of operations which ensure the correct positioning of the mirrors, the effectiveness of the adhesion, and electrical conductivity through the array of mirrors. In the application of the mirrors, use is made of a fixed structure 1 for supporting the panel 6 , a transferring tool on which the mirrors are temporarily retained in contact with separate support areas by a vacuum, and a loading tool 22 arranged to receive the mirrors from the transferring tool and apply them to the panel 6 .
