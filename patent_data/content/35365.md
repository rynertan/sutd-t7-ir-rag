# Method and apparatus for fault detection.

## Abstract
This invention relates to methods and apparatus for de tecting the occurrence of a fault on a conductor or trans mission line and for protecting the conductor or line in accord ance with the determination of fault. The instantaneous value of the voltage V and current i , or the modal components of that voltage and current in the case of a polyphase line, are formed into two functions S
