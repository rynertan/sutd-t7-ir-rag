# PROCESS FOR BORONATING DISPERSANTS, BORONATED DISPERSANTS AND FLUID COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING THE SAME

## Abstract
Boronation of hydrocarbyl substituted succinimide disper sants e.g. for lubricating oils may be conducted by adding a lower alcohol solution of a boronating agent to the dispersant and distilling out the alcohol. The product is substantially haze free and is compatible with fluoroelastomers such as are often used in heavy duty clutch plate facings.
