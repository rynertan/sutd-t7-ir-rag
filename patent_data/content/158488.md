# Vinylidene fluoride resin film, process for production thereof and metallized film thereof.

## Abstract
A vinylidene fluoride resin film having 1 a crystal melting point of 182 C or higher as measured by differential scanning calorimeter in nitrogen atmosphere at a tempera ture elevation speed of 10 C min 2 a diffraction point corresponding to 1 1 ζ of the α phase crystal in the wide angle X ray diffraction photograph and 3 an orientation degree of the crystal of 0.85 or more when measured under irradiation of X ray incident vertically on a major surface of the film. The vinylidene fluoride resin film is obtained by inflation accompanying melt necking stretching. The film has improved mechanical properties and heat stability and is also adapted for use as a base film of a metallized film.
