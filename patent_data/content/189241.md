## Description
A MOTOR VEHICLE CHASSIS This invention relates generally to automotive chassis having independent suspension systems for both front and rear wheels and more particularly to independent suspension systems using longitudinally extending control arms pivotally attached to a central passenger compartment. The automotive chassis of the present invention includes longitudinally extending control arms which are hinged about transverse axes to a central passenger compartment. U.S. Patent 2,554,261 to Hunger discloses a vehicle having a skeletonized frame in which front and rear control arms are attached to transverse axes. U.S.Patent 2,001,846 to Ledwinka discloses another arrangement in which leading and trailing longitudinally extending arms are attached to the side rails of a perimeter frame. U.S. Patent 2,888,271 to Butterfield discloses yet another arrangement for leading and trailing suspension arms attached to the side rails of the vehicle frame. According to the invention there is provided claim a motor vehicle chassis comprising, a central structural section comprising a passenger compartment terminating at its leading and trailing ends in panels, and a suspension system comprising longitudinally extending control arms pivotally attached to at least said leading or trailing ends of said central structural section. The present invention offers the advantage of compactness and weight reduction over the designs utilzied by others. The chassis and suspension arrangement of the present invention needs no structure to support the suspension lying outboard of the central structural section with the exception of a cowl extension which connects the front spring and front shock absorbers with the remainder of the dash panel and brackets serving a similar purpose with respect to the rear spring. The central structural section terminates at its leading end in a dash panel and at its trailing end in a kickup panel. The central structural section may be of unitized construction or may have a separate frame and body panels. In either case, the front of the structural section ends with a dash panel running substantially vertically upward from the bottom of the structural section and a rear kickup panel running substantially vertically upward from the back of the structural section. Left and right front control arms are pivoted to the dash panel about substantially transverse axes and extend longitudinally forward from the dash panel.Left and right rear control arms are pivoted to the kickup panel about substantially transverse axes and extend longitudinally rearward from the kickup panel.Left and right front wheel carriers are attached to the left and right front control arms and left and right rear wheel carriers are attached to the left and right rear control arms. Front and rear transverse leaf springs are attached respectively to a cowl extension of the dash panel and to the kickup panel. The outboard ends of the front leaf spring are attached to the wheel carriers and theioutboard ends of the rear leaf spring are attached to the rear control arms. At least one telescoping shock absorber is provided between each control arm and the dash panel in the front and between each control arm and the kickup panel in the rear of the chassis. A steering gear is operably attached to the left and right front wheel carriers and affixed to the dash panel. The invention will now be described further by way of example, with reference to the accomanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a perspective view of the central structural section of the chassis of the present invention, Figure 2 is a perspective view of the front suspension and front portion of the central structural section of the chassis of the present invention, Figure 3 is a cross sectional view of the bushing mounts for the transverse leaf springs included in the chassis of the present invnetion, and Figure 4 is a perspective view of the rear suspension and kickup panel of the chassis of the present invention. As shown in Figure 1, central structural section 2 includes a space for passengers and baggage as well as front dash panel 4 and rear kickup panel 8 to which the front and rear suspension respectively, are attached. Cowl extension 6 provides means for attaching front transverse spring 17 shown in Figure 2 and left and right front shock absorbers 34 and 36 to dash panel 4.Structural section 2 may be constructed as a perimeter frame on which discrete body panels are applied or as a unitized construction in which body panels and structural members are combined. Those skilled in the art of designing automobile structures will appreciate several other methods for constructing structural section 2. The front suspension and front structure of the present invention are detailed in Figure 2. Left front control arm 10 and right front control arm 12 run longitudinally forward from dash panel 4. Front control arm 10 is pivotally attached to dash panel 4 by pivot 18 containing a pivot axis which is substantially transverse to the vehicle center line. Right control arn 12 is attached in an identical manner by a pivot which is not shown. The pivot desirably includes one or more bushing assemblies of the type described in U.S. Patent 3.111.307. Left front wheel carrier 14 and right front wheel carrier 16 are attached to the leading ends of front control arms by pivotal joints 20 and 22 respectively. Front transverse leaf spring 17 is pivotally attached to the wheel carrier at its outboard ends 24 and 26.Spring 17 is attached to cowl extension 6 by clamp assemblies 19 and 21. Clamp assemblies 19 and 21, as shown in Figure 3. comprise an inner elastoneric bushing through which the leaf spring passes and an outer housing which holds the bushing in compression.Elastomeric bushing 56 is cylindrical in shape and has a slot 58 through which the spring passes. Bushing 56 is clamped to the spring by mounting 60 which is comprised of halves 60a and 60b. The assembly shown in Figure 3 may be used for mounting both the front and rear transverse leaf springs. Other means for clamping the springs will be apparent to those skilled in the art. As shown in Figure 2, telescoping shock absorbers 34 and 36 are pivotally attached to the front control arms at their lower end. and pivotally attached to cowl extension 6 at their upper ends. Steering gear 28 is rigidly attached to dash panel 4 by brackets not shown and pivotally attached at its outboard ends 30 and 32 to wheel carriers 14 and 16. Figure 4 shows details of the rear suspension and chassis of the present invention. Only the right rear side is shown, the left rear being identical. Right rear control arm 38 is pivotally attached to kickup panel 8 by pivot OZ which has an axis generally transverse to the center line of the vehicle. Right rear wheel carrier 40 is attached to control arm 38 and provides a mounting for right rear road wheel and tire assembly not shown .Shock absorber 48 is attached at its upper end by means of pivot assembly 50 to kickup panel 8 and at its lower end by means of pivot assembly 52 to right rear control arm. Transverse leaf spring 44 is attached to control arm 38 by means of pivot assembly 54. 8peeing 4 is attached to the kickup panel by moans of clamp assembly 46 which is attached to the kickup panel. The arrangements presented herein for mounting of the control arms to the dash panel and kickup panel are advantageous because no frame rails are needed extending forwardly or rearwardly of the central structural section. As a result, space and weight savings are possible over coavntional chassis and suspension designs. It will be appreciated that the mounting of the front and rear control arms at the fold lines1 joining the vertical dash and kickup panels with the horizontal panels forming the passenger compartment s floor provides additional stability to the suspension inasmuch as the fold line areas are characterized by high structural strength. The tern chassis when used in the specification and claims. will be understood to refer to either a conventional vehicle chassis or a conventional unitary chassis and body construction, and is intended to include vehicle structure and components connected to or supported upon the chassis structure.
