# MATERIAL APPLICATOR

## Abstract
The invention concerns an applicator for pasty, liquid or semi liquid cosmetics materials such as mascara. Known ap plicators, in which an elongate applicator member formed integrally with a closure for a contained of the material, may comprise a twisted wire brush carried at the end of a support shaft, have the disadvantage that the geometry of the brush is fixed. Thus a brush ideal for one type of application will be generally unsuitable for another. Other known applicators having fine end bristles suffer the problem that the bristles become damaged upon insertion through a narrow wiper opening of the material container. The arrangement of the invention avoids these problems by providing a cover 4 for the material retaining part 3 of the elongate member, rel ative movement between this cover and elongate member being permitted to provide selective and or adjustable cov ering of the material retaining part. Thus the amount of this part 3 which is exposed for use can be varied. The config uration of the exposed part may also change.
