# INTERPENETRATING POLYMER NETWORK COMPOSITIONS EMPLOYING RUBBER MODIFIED POLYMERS

## Abstract
This invention provides hardenable compositions useful as construction media for a wide range of applications. Par ticular utility is found in the dental and medical arts where such compositions are highly suitable for the formation and construction of denture base, denture baseplates, denture liners, denture repair, custom trays, veneering for crowns and bridgework, artificial teeth, veneers and repair for natural teeth, and tooth restorative fillings. Such materials having improved impact strengths and elastic moduli when har dened are disclosed which include rubber modified polymer.
