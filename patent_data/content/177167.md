## Description
POROUS TUBES This invention relates to porous tubes and to methoas and apparatus for making them. Porous tubes according to the invention may be suitable for lining with a semi permeable membrane to act as a support for the same in apparatus for filtering by reverse osmosis. Typically, such tubes have an internal diameter ot 1.5 cm or so ana lengths up to about 4 metres.Conventionally, they are made by wrapping a tape of suitable thermoplastic material helically on to a mandrel and forming welded seams between adjacent turns of the helix. Such seams become non porous and reduce the effective surface area of the support. Porous tubes can also be made by a needling process. However, such tubes, especially when they have relatively thin walls, tend to be too flexible for some applications. The present invention provides an alternative porous tube ana a methoa ana apparatus for making the same which have advantages over previous techniques. The invention comprises a porous tube comprising a wall material of thermally bonded nonwoven. The tube may be seamless, and is suitable for lining with a semi permeable membrane. The invention also comprises a method of making a porous tube comprising forming a tubular fibre mass, incluaing a melt component ana a structure component, around a mandrel, and compacting the fibre mass and heating ana cooling it to cause said melt component to melt and reset to form bonds between structure component fibres, ana removing the resultant thermobonded tube from the mandrel. The web or fleece may be wrapped, at approximately final tube length, several times about the mandrel, to form a single length of tube which will be seamless. The web or fleece may be wrapped with a small helix angle to form a tube with tapered ends. The manarel itself may be slightly tapered to facilitate removal of the finished tube therefrom. The wrappea web or fleece may be compacted by an arrangeflent of rotary rollers extending the length of the mandrel. The roller arrangement may be located in an oven to effect the melting of the melt component. The tube may be formed continously by wrapping a fibre web or fleece continuously on one end of a mandrel and moving the wrapped web or fleece along the mandrel whilst compacting it. This mandrel may be tapered, the tube being continuously moved towards the narrow end of the mandrel. The tubular fibre mass may be needle punched while on the mandrel. The mandrel may have holes in it into which needles can pass from a guide member adjacent the mandrel with alignea apertures, needle oscillating means ariving the neeoles through the fibre mass between the guide member and the mandrel. The guide means may be cylindrically disposed about the mandrel, the needles oscillating radially. The web or fleece may be supplied from a carding process. A card web may be folded, as by a cross folaer, to increase its thickness. The web or fleece may have portions of aifferent materials whereby different parts of the tube will be of such different materials. A first wrappea part of the web may be of a first material and a second wrapped part of a second material whereby the inside of the tube is of the first material and the outsiae of the tube of the second material. The invention also comprises apparatus for making a porous tube comprising a manarel on which a web or fleece of fibre can be wrapped to form a tubular fibre mass, compacting means for compacting said mass while on said manorel, ana heating means for thermobonaing said mass. Said compacting means may comprise an arrangement of rollers parallel to and surrounding said manarel in which the mandrel with its wrapped fibre mass can be rolled. The invention will be further apparent from the following description, with reference to the figures of the accompanying drawing, which illustrate, by way of example only, certain features of one method emboaying the invention. Of the drawings Figure 1 shows one embodiment of apparatus for the formation of a tube from a tibrous mass Figure 2 shows apparatus for subjecting the tube to mechanical ana thermal treatment. Figure 3 is a diagrammatic illustration of a continuous operating arrangement, and Figure 4 is a cross section through a needling arrangement. Referring first to Figure 1, it will be seen that a fibrous web W is delivered to a platform 10 from a carding engine 11 which may have an associated cross foloer. The web includes thermoplastic material the melt component having a lower melting point than the remainaer of the material therein the structure component , and may conveniently be produced from a bi component fibre, though blends of different fibre types are also possible. A mandrel 12 having a length corresponding to the length of tube T to be produced extends alongside one eage of the platform 10. When the web W has been delivered sufficiently to extena over the length of the platform 10, the manarel 12 is laia onto the web W at the position inaicatea by the chain dotted line and the eage of the web L is folaea by bar member 13 over the mandrel 12. The manarel 12 is then rolled across the platform 10 in the direction of the arrow X to cause the web to be wrapped around the mandrel 12 to form a tube T. A valuable feature is the ability to supply fibres to the carding engine 11 such that one half of the web is of aifferent type from the other enabling the insiae of the tube T to be of different material, such as preaominantly polypropylene which readily accepts polysulphone to form a semi permeable membrane lining , from the outsioe which may be preaominantly of polyester which gives dimensional stability . The mandrel 12, which has a slight taper to facilitate tube removal, is then transferred to an oven 20 shown diagrammatically in Figure 2. Rollers 21 are closed to grip the tube T against the mandrel 12 ana rotatea to effect mechanical compaction of the fibrous mass as it is heated to soften the thermoplastic component. The mandrel 12 is then transferred to a cooling zone 22 where further rollers 23 are closea to grip the tube T and rotated to continue compaction as the tube I cools to complete the thermobonuing of the fibrous structure. The mandrel 12 is then removea from the zone 22 and the completed tube T slid therefrom. If, in rolling the mandrel 12 across the platform 10 the airection is alterea slightly to introauce a small degree of helical wrapping of the webE, the tube will have tapered ends. Figure 3 shows a continuously operating arrangement in which a carding machine 31 delivers a web 32 to a cross foluer 33 which in turn delivers a multi ply fleece 34 to a continuously rotating mandrel 35 which is cantileverea from a bearing 36 and driving arrangement 37. Roller means 38 engage the fleece 34 to compact it on and move it along the mandrel 35 away from the bearing 36. Still on the mandrel 35 the wrapped and compacted fleece 34 is heated in an oven 39, which may comprise radiant heaters, and then moves off the end of the mandrel 35. Figure 4 shows in cross section a needling arrangement which can be used with the apparatus ofFigure 1 or Figure 3 comprising guide means 41 arranged cylindrically around the rotating mandrel 42 which has holes 43 into which neeoles 44 can pass. The needles 44 are reciprocatea through the fibre mass 45 between.the guide means 41 ana the mandrel 42 by driven needle bars 46. The intensity of the needling can be very much less than that required for a purely needlea tube, which means that the density of the tube wall can be very much less for a given strength. The rigiaity of the tube can also be controlled by the amount of needling effected ana or by the amount ana nature of thermobonding effected. Porous tubes made as described can be used, as already remarked, in reverse osmosis filtration apparatus. Polyester tubes can be manufactured also for medical and hygiene purposes, for example for prosthetic arteries, tampon sleeves and so on.
