# Process for producing substantially linear carbonate polymer.

## Abstract
A process for producing substantially linear carbonate polymer comprising a. introducing carbonic dihalide to a substantially anhy drous solution comprising inert organic solvent, at least one substituted or unsubstituted 1,3 propanediol and a catalytic amount of nitrogen containing, hydrohalide salt forming, ther mally regenerable organic catalyst, while the temperature of the solution is in the range of from about 70 C to about 225 C and b. removing hydrogen halide from the vicinity of the solu tion.
