# ELECTRO PNEUMATIC CONTROL SYSTEM FOR VALVE BAG FILLING APPARATUS

## Abstract
A control system for use in a valve bag filling apparatus eliminates sifting of product during the filling process. A filling nozzle 10 is inserted into the valve of a bag to be filled. A flow of particulate material is provided through the filling nozzle 10 and into the bag. When the bag is full, the flow of particulate material is terminated. A blast of high pressure air 46 is then introduced into the nozzle 10 in order to clear the nozzle of any residual particulate material therein. A low pressure blast of air 23 is introduced between the nozzle and the filling valve to suspend any particles present in the filling valve after the nozzle has been cleared by the high pressure blast 46 . A vacuum is introduced into the nozzle to suck any suspended particles out of the filling valve after the low pressure blast has been introduced. An inflatable boot 14 can be provided on the nozzle 10 to seal the nozzle within the valve of the bag during filling. Control of the system is effected by electro pneumatic components.
