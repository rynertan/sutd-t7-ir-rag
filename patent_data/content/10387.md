# Improvements in and relating to spring suspensions for vehicle seats.

## Abstract
A vehicle seat suspension, of the type comprising a seat frame 12 supported on a base frame 11 by two spaced pairs of scissor action linkage arms 13,14 , has the ends of the linkage arms connected to one of the frames wholly by pivotal connections e.g., 15,18 having freedom for displacement longitudinally of the suspension and a resilient coupling 46 connecting the one frame to one of the linkage arms to damp the transmission of vibrations between the frames in the longitudinal direction.
