# AUTOMATIC WAVELENGTH CALIBRATION CORRECTION SYSTEM

## Abstract
A system for maintaining the wavelength scale calibra tion of diffraction grating based spectrometers and monochromators is disclosed. The system utilizes the ap proximately fixed angular relationship between diffracted and undiffracted light emanating from the diffraction grating to maintain the calibration of an instrument. One or more photodetectors are used to measure shifts in an undiffracted image due to mechanical misalignments that cause errors in the instrument s wavelength scale. Once direction and degree of shift known, the instrument is recalibrated either by adjusting various mechanical and or optical structures within the instrument to shift the undiffracted images by an amount equal to, but in a direction opposite the measured shift so that the diffracted light is likeweise shifted, or by relabeling the wavelength scale outputs by an amount de rived from the measured shift.
