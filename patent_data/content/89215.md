# Hazard warning device.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a hazard warning device, in particular to a device for displaying a visible warning of icy conditions. The device of the invention comprises a display panel 11 having a warning legend defined by transparent 13, 14, 15 and opaque areas 12 of the panel 11 . Disposed behind the display panel 11 there is at least one layer 16 having a light reflective property which changes with temperature, the layer 16 comprising thermochromic liquid crystal material. The display panel legend and reflective layer 16 or layers are arranged such that the device when disposed as a warning sign alongside a surface subject to icy conditions, e.g. a road surface, and by virtue of the colour changes with temperature exhibited by the liquid crystal material in the or each layer 16 , displays on the display panel 11 a coloured warning legend against a contrasting background when such conditions are imminent or present. Otherwise the display panel 11 appears to be substantially of a uniform colour when viewed by reflected light.
