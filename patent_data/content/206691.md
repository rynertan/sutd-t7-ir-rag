## Description
PRODUCTION OF DEUTERIUM CONTAINING CHEMICAL SUBSTANCES The present invention relates to production of deuterium containing i.e. deuterated chemical substances.More particularly, it relates to deuterium containing media for plant cell culture, plant cell cultivation with said media, plant cell culture products from culture mixtures after said cultivation, recovery of deuterium containing chemical substances from said culture products and deuterium containing chemical substances thus recovered. Deuterium is used widely as a stable nuclear species in production of labeled compounds, and there are known a number of deuterated organic and inorganic substances. These deuterated chemical substances are usually produced by chemical syntheses, and production of deuterated chemical substacnes by chemical syntheses becomes difficult with enhancement of complexity of their molecular structures and increase of the deuterium contents therein. On the other hand, the demands to chemical substances having high deuterium contents as reagents or tracers for research on the biotic metabolism and the biological activity are increased in recent years. Aiming at efficient production of chemical substances having high deuterium contents, an extensive study has been made, and in the course of such study, attempt has been made to attain said aim by utilization of plant cells having a capability of producing chemical substances. Since plant cells are considered to have no capability of differentiating usual hydrogen atoms from heavy hydrogen atoms i.e. deuterium , it may be necessary to keep high concentrations of deuterium in media wherein plant cells are cultivated for production of chemical substances having high deuterium contents. Hitherto, cultivation of some kinds of microorganisms including bacteria and fungi in deuterium containing media was made, and growth of those microrganisms was recognized to be successful in some cases and not successful in some other cases. But, there is no report on cultivation of plant cells other than microorganisms in deuteriumcontaining media. Therefore, it was not predictable whether plant cells can grow in media having high deuterium concentrations. It was also not predictable whether higher plant cells can well grow in media having high deuterium concentrations to an extent sufficient to recover the produced deuterium containing chemical substances from said media. It has now been found that plant cells, particularly higher plant cells, can in general well grow in deuterium containing media, although suppression on the growth may be somewhat observed. Particularly when cultivation is effected with gradual increase of the deuterium concentration in the media, the plant cells are provided with adaptability, and their growth proceeds smoothly.Chemical substances having higher deuterium contents can be produced with the progress of the growth. This invention is based on the above findings According to the present invention, there is provided a process for cultivation of plant cells to produce chemical substances having high deuterium contents, characterized in that the cultivation is effected in a nutrient medium wherein not less than 85 of the total hydrogen atoms are deuterium. This invention will be hereinafter explained more in detail taking production of deuterated tocopherol by cultivation of Chlorella ellipsoidea as a typical example.Needless to say, this invention should not be understood to be limited to this typical example only. In other words, this invention may be likewise applied to cultivation of various plant cells other than chlorella cells for production of various chemical substances. Particulrly when it is applied to cultivation of plant cells which can grow in a photoautotrophic system, chemical substances wherein all the hydrogen atoms are deuterium are obtainable. In this case, the characteristic effect of the invention can be the most well recognized. For production of chemical substances having high deuterium contents according to the process of the invention, a plant cell having a capability of a desired chemical substance is added to a nutrient medium containing deuterium under sterilized conditions. The nutrient medium may be anyone appropriately chosen from conventional liquid and solid media depending upon the purpose, insofar as deuterium is contained and not less than 85 of the total hydrogen atoms are deuterium. Namely, the basic composition of the nutrient medium may comprise water, inorganic salts e.g. sodium salts, potassium salts, calcium salts, magnesium salts, ammonium salts, phosphates, sulfates, nitrates , carbon sources e.g. sucrose, glucose, fructose, maltose, raffinose, starch, dextrin , growth regulators e.g. auxin, cytokinin, kinetin, benzyladenine , organic trace substances e.g. thiamine, nicotinic acid, pyridoxin, p aminobenzoic acid, folic acid, choline, myoinositol, glycine , natural extracts e.g. casein hydrolyzate, yeast extract, malt extract, coconut milk , agar, etc. In order to have deuterium included, heavy water i.e. deuterated water is usually employed instead of normal water. Other deuterated substances utilizable in the metabolism of the plant cell as used may be also employed. In case of chlorella, for instance, there may be employed Kanazawa medium as conventionally used for the cultivation of chlorella, in which, however, water is substituted with heavy water having a deuterium content of not less than 85 . Preferably, all the hydrogen atoms in all the components in the nutrient medium may be replaced by deuterium, whereby chemical substances in which all the hydrogen atoms are deuterium are obtainable. In case of algal cells other than chlorella, there may be used Borbox medium, Bristol medium, Ditmer medium, etc., in which water is replaced by heavy water. In case of higher plant cells, there may be used White medium, Linsmaier Skoog medium, etc.in which water is substituted with heavy water. Prior to addition of the plant cell, the nutrient medium is usually subjected to treatment for elimination of contaminating microorganisms therefrom. For this purpose, there may be adopted autoclave method, steam sterilization method, etc. When, however, the deuterium content in the nutrient medium is high, the elimination is preferably attained by filtration or irradiation with gamma rays. The nutrient medium to which the plant cell was added is then cultivated at an appropriate temperature over a certain period of time while maintaining a suitable pH depending upon the kind and property of the plant cell. In case of chlorella, for instance, the cultivation is usually carried out at a temperature around 250C for about 2 weeks.The cultivation may be effected by any per se conventional procedure such as shaking culture, agitation culture, stationary culture, etc., and an appropriate one may be chosen therefrom taking the kind and property of the plant cell into consideration. The cultivation period may be also appropriately decided depending on the kind of the plant cell and the production efficiency of the objective chemical substance. When the plant cell is photoautotrophic like chlorella, light irradiation is needed for growth, and usually a light intensity of not less than 1,000 lux, particularly of not less than 5,000 lux, is desirable. When desired, air or oxygen may be introduced into the nutrient medium. In case of using a photoautotrophic one, aeration enriched with carbon dioxide is particularly preferred for promotion of the growth. From the thus obtained culture mixture which comprises the grown plant cells and the nutrient medium, the deuterium containing chemical substances are recovered.Separation of the plant cells from the culture mixture may be effected by a per se conventional separation procedure such as filtration, centrifugation and or extraction. The separated plant cells or nutrient medium may be obtained in a dry state by lyophilization and or drying with hot air.Separation of the deuterium containing substances from the wet or dried product of the plant cells or nutrient medium may be attained by the separation procedure applicable to the non deuterium containing substances corresponding to the deuterium containing substances. For instance, non polar and oil soluble substances such as sterols and fatty acids can be effectively recovered by extraction with organic solvents e.g. methanol, acetone, ether, benzene, ethyl acetate is effective. Further, for instance, water soluble substances such as glycosides and polysaccharides can be effectively recovered by extraction with aqueous solvents such as hot water and aqueous alcohols.When chlorella cells are cultivated for production of deuterated tocopherols, the culture mixture is filtered to separate into the nutrient medium as a liquid and the chlorella cells as a solid, and the chlorella cells are centrifuged, washed with water and dried to obtain a dried chlorella cell product.This dried product is extracted with an organic solvent such as acetone or methanol, and the resulting extract is distilled to remove the organic solvent. The residue is subjected to column chromatography to obtain deuterated tocopherol. Confirmation of the production of deuterated substances is usually made by mass spetrometry. When, for instance, the deuterated substance is tocopherol, the parent peak of deuterated tocopherol may be distributed over the range from the one due to non deuterated tocopherol C29H5002 having a molecular weight of 430 to the one due to perfectly deuterated tocophenol C29D5002 having a molecular weight of 480 unless the deuterium content of the nutrient medium is 100 . Since non deuterated tocopherol produces peaks of p l and p 2 respectively at m z 431 and at m z 432, observation of peaks having higher intensities at m z 431 and 432 or of any peak at m z 433 or more means the presence of deuterated substances. When any peak is not observed between m z 430 and 479 and only the peaks at m z 480, 481 and 482 are observed, the product may be confirmed to be perfectly deutrated. Confirmation of deuterated substances in the extract or the plant cell dried product without their isolation may be effected by isolating any typical component from said extract or said plant cell dried product and examining whether the typical component is deuterated or not. Practical and presently preferred embodiments of the invention are illustratively shown in the followingExamples.
