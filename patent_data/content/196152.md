# TESTING DIGITAL INTEGRATED CIRCUITS

## Abstract
A digital integrated circuit includes a register 10 having a normal mode of operation in which it acts as a parallel input output register. The register also has a second mode of opera tion in which it acts as a pseudo random number generator, and a third mode in which it is connected as a circular shift register. This allows the register to be used for producing a vari ety of different test sequences for testing other parts of the cir cuits e.g. for testing a programmable logic array included in the circuit.
