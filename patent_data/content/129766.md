# A method of, and apparatus for, measuring electro kinetic properties of charged particles dispersed in a liquid medium.

## Abstract
A method of measuring electro chemical properties of a liquid medium comprises the steps of positioning two elec trodes to contact the liquid medium, energising the electrodes with an alternating electrical potential to cause a charge sep aration in the liquid medium and thereby to generate an acoustic signal, spacing an acoustic transducer from the elec trodes for detecting the acoustic signal, and measuring the amplitude of the detected signal, the amplitude being a func tion of the electrokinetic properties of particles, emulsion droplets or the like, present in the liquid medium and the number of these particles or droplets per unit volume. An apparatus for performing this method is also dis closed.
