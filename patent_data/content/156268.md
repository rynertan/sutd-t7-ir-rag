# Process for producing polyaminopolyamides containing halohydrin functionality.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a novel process for producing water soluble, cationic resins containing halohydrin functionality from basic polyaminopolyamides containing secondary amine function ality without the use of epihalohydrin. The process of this invention comprises reacting the basic polyaminopolyamide in aqueous medium with an allyl halide to form allyl sub stituents on tertiary nitrogen atoms, converting the allyl sub stituents to halohydrin moieties by reaction with hypohalous acid and then maintaining the resulting solution at a pH of at least 7.0 until the Gardner Holdt viscosity of the solution at 24 solids and 25 C. reaches at least B.
