# Line pipe forming apparatus.

## Abstract
A machine for forming line pipe is disclosed wherein small diameter roll elements 11,12,13 not exceeding five times the thickness of the blank form a tube. The roll ele ments 11 13 positioned in a pyramid roll assembly are dynamically adjustable toward and away from each other to provide different size line pipe, or similar tubular articles. The segments of the roll elements 12 are mounted on cantilever arms 45 , the leading edge of blank being deflected against the upper curved surface of the arms 45 during the final stages of forming. The deflection is maintained within the elastic recovery limit of the metal. A rigid frame mounts the cantilever arm 45 and other components. The frame includes a plurality of vertical bed plates 20 and corres ponding upper frame plates 30 and cross tie members 31 . A pusher mechanism pushes the sheet blank through the pyramid roll assembly. A multiwalled tube may be formed by providing the required additional length to the blank and continuation of the forming beyond 360 . The blank is con fined between idler rollers 47a 47e on the frame structures during forming. Special roller handling assemblies are pro vided for loading the blank and for unloading the finished tube from the machine.
