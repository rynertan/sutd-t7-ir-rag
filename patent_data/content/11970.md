# Connecting assembly and its application to a thermometer.

## Abstract
A rigid stem dial gauge, such as a thermometer has an assembly which connects the stem to the head and permits the two parts to be disposed at a range of angles to each other. The assembly comprises a pair of cylindrical housings, one mounted coaxially and rotatably within the other, the inner housing 12 being connected to the system shaft 16 of the gauge and the outer housing being connected to the pointer shaft 17 of the head. The two shafts are inter connected by a flexible drive 19 accommodated within the housings.
