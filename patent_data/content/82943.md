# ROTATIONAL MAGNETIC TRANSDUCER AND TRANSDUCER MOTOR ASSEMBLY USING THE SAME

## Abstract
A magnetic transducer 10 is provided having a plurality of magnetic poles 23 arranged annularly about an axis to form a stator coacting with a rotor 28 which rotates about the same axis to induce changes in the magnetic forces between the poles. Each of the poles in the stator has a sense coil 24 thereon for generating an electric output signal in response to the induced changes in flux. At least one pair of these magnetic poles have the same polarity and are positioned substantially 180 apart. The sense coils on each of the poles in this pair are connected in series so that the resulting output electrical signal from these coils would be cumulative.
