## Description
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention This invention relates to ethylene polymer plastic compositions useful for producing extruded or molded polyethylene products having improved transparency. Description of the Prior Art Polyolefin resins such as polyethylene have been used for a number of years for the preparation of products such as packaging materials and containers in the form of films, sheets or molded articles. Unlike high pressure low density polyethylene, where the optical properties are governed primarily by rheological factors, the optical properties of narrow molecular weight distribution ethylene polymers are controlled primarily by crystallization effects, i.e., spherulite size. Heterogenous nucleating additives can improve ethylene polymers opticals by increasing the nucleation rate and hence the overall rate of crystallization, thereby generating smaller spherulites. Heretofore extremely pure dibenzylidene sorbitol DBS commercially known as EC 1 and available from EC 1 Chemicals Industries, Osaka,Japan or from Milliken Chemical Co., USA, has been used as a nucleating agent to improve the optical properties of polyethylene products. Thus, according to U. S. Patent 4,016,118, issued to Kenzo Hamada et al on April 5, 1977, there is provided a polyolefin plastic composition having improved transparency and reduced molding shrinkage, which consists essentially of at least one polymer or copolymer of an aliphatic monoolefin and dibenzlyidene sorbitol, the proportion of the dibenzylidene sorbitol being 0.1 to 0.7 by weight based on the total weight of the composition. However, under some fabrication operations and conditions, even high levels of DBS may not improve the transparency reduced haze of Ziegler type catalyzed linear low density polyethylene UDPE since a critical concentration is required. Moreover, even in the case where DBS is effective, high concentrations are required. SinceDBS is an expensive material, reduction of the concentrations needed to produce desired results is of commercial significance. Moreover, the use of DBS to enhance the optical properties of LLDPE is not entirely satisfactory from a practical commercial standpoint since the effectiveness of DBS as a nucleating agent can be seriously impaired in the presence of the catalyst residues and or by products generated during the LLDPE resin forming process or during the fabrication of the desired product. Optical properties of extruded films produced from Ziegler Natta catalyzed resins containing antioxidants can be improved with the addition of an acid acceptor to prevent surface distortions known as pin striping and gel streaking. The surface distortions are produced as a result of adverse interactions between catalyst residues and or by products, antioxidants and the resin. Thus according to U.S. Patent ApplicationSerial No. 21516 filed in the name of Michael A.Cowan and George N. Foster and assigned to a common assignee, the optical properties described above are improved by extruding a resin film forming composition which contains an antioxidant in the presence of an acid acceptor which reacts with the catalyst residue, the latter being suspected of cuasing optical degradation via the pin striping mechanism. Other treatments disclosed in the prior art involve the addition of compounds to the polymer prior to fabrication in order to complex with the harmful components in the catalyst residue and deactivate them. Illustrative of these prior art treatments are those disclosed in Canadian Patent 961,998, U.S. Patent 4,013,622 and in U.S. Patent 3,773,743. For example, U.S. Patent 3,773,732 discloses a method for improving the stability and color of olefin polymers by deactivating theirZiegler Natta catalyst residues. This method involves high temperature 1900C 2500C processing with hydroxyl compounds H2O and primary alcohols and with an organic base such as an alkyl amine aryl amine Li, Ca and Zn salts of carboxylic acids trialkyl phosphites and metal alkoxides.The concentration disclosed for the hydroxy source is in the range of 0.5 to 1.5 weight percent and a concentration of 50 to 2500 parts per million ppm is disclosed for the organic base. At the processing temperatures disclosed, some of the organic bases and the hydroxy sources would be volatile and cause foaming of the product if the processing were not done in a way to remove volatiles. However, as mentioned previously, in processing UDPE resins, clarity in the final product is determined by crystallization factors of the composition and hence control of the formation of pinstripes and or other surface defects gel streaking by the above prior art methods is independent and fundamentally different from the techniques described herein.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 1. Objects of the Invention An object of the present invention is to provide an ethylene polymer composition comprising aZiegler type catalyzed ethylene polymer, and extruded films and molded articles fabricated from such compositions which have excellent transparency with reduced haze. Another object of the present invention is to provide a stearate compound selected from the group consisting of zinc stearate, magnesium stearate and calcium stearate for a Ziegler type catalyzed ethylene polymer composition containingDBS wherein said stearate compound maintains the effectiveness of the DBS in improving the clarity of the film and or molded product produced from the composition. Another object of the present invention is to generate improvement of opticala ç.g.. lower haze, at lower concentrations of D3S than those normally required for ethylene polymer paste forming compositions. A A still further object of the present invention is an ethylene polymer plastic composition comprising LLDPS, DBS and a stearate compound selected from the group consisting of zinc stearate, magnesium stearate and calcium stearate, which composition is eminently suitable for forming films or molded articles having a high degree of clarity. 2. Brief Summary of the Invention This invention is based on the discovery that the beneficial effects of DBS in improving the optical properties of ethylene polymer compositions can be maintained during processing through the addition of relatively small amounts of a stearate compound selected from the group consisting of zinc stearate, magnesium stearate and calcium stearate, preferably zinc stearate to the ethylene polymer DBS composition prior to forming the finished article. As a result of the invention, the finished products, produced from said compositions whether they be in the form, of film or molded articles, have a relatively high degree of clarity. In addition it has been discovered that the utilization of a stearate compound selected from the group consisting of zinc stearate, magnesium stearate and calcium stearate, in relatively small amounts reduces the critical level of DBS normally required in ethylene polymer compositions to improve the clarity of the finished products produced from said compositions. 3. Description of the Preferred Embodiments In one aspect, the present invention relates to an ethylene polymer plastic composition which, when molded or extruded, forms a film or article having good clarity the composition comprising an ethylene polymer resin, DBS and a stearate compound selected from the group consisting of zinc stearate, magnesium stearate and calcium stearate. The ethylene polymer resin contains residues from a Ziegler type catalyst used in its preparation. In still another aspect the present invention, relates to a method of maintaining and enhancing the effectiveness of DBS when said DBS is utilized to enhance the optical properties of ethylene polymer forming compositions which method comprises adding zinc stearate or magnesium stearate or calcium stearate to said composition in an amount sufficient to maintain and enhance the optical properties of films or articles formed from said composition. The DBS can be added to the ethylene polymer and mixed by any suitable mixing means. The stearate compound can be uniformly dispersed in the ethylene based extrusion composition. The dispersion can be effected by various dispersion techniques commonly employed by those skilled in the art of preparing extrudable compositions. The stearate compound can be introduced into the ethylene polymer containing DBS or along with DBS either by directly dry blending with ethylene polymer via a V type blender or by mixing via a Henschel type intensive mixer. The stearate compound and DBS can also be hot compounded directly into the ethylene polymer or into a base polymer to make a masterbatch for the final letdown using conventional hot processing equipment such as a Banbury mixer, a Werner Pfleider twin screw mixing extruder or a single screw mixer extruder that has pelletization equipment on the head of the extruder. The dibenzylidene sorbitol DBS is a white powder having a melting point of 2100 to 2120C.which is obtained by reacting 1 mole of d sorbitol and 2 moles of benzaldehyde in the presence of an acid catalyst at an elevated temperature. It includes an isomer of the formulaEMI7.1 and is typically expressed by the following structural formulaEMI7.2 The dibenzylidene sorbitol obtained by the above method contains about 2 of by product monobenzylidene sorbitol and tribenzylidene sorbitol. Although it is not always necessary to remove these impurities, the product is preferably purified so that the purity of the dibenzylidene sorbitol becomes 99.0 to 99.5 or more. The purification can be performed by recrystallization from dimethyl formamide. The dibenzylidene sorbitol is also as indicated previously commercially available fromEC 1 Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan or fromMilliken Chemical Co., U.S.A. The proportion of the dibenzylidene sorbitol required in the composition of this invention is variable and depends upon such factors as intrinsic resin properties, temperatures experienced during processing, fabrication conditions and the amount of stearate compound used in the composition. In general, the proportion of the dibenzylidene sorbitol in the composition of this invention is about 0.09 to 0.35 by weight, preferably about 0.12t to 0.258 by weight, based on the total weight of the composition. Amounts of dibenzylidene sorbitol in excess of about 0.35 by weight may be used, however, since the compound is expensive, the increased costs far outweigh any advantages. The stearate compounds of the present invention are commercially available compounds which are readily obtainable from a wide variety of sources. The preferred stearate compound is zinc stearate. In general, the proportion of stearate compound in the composition of this invention is about 0.04 to 0.35 by weight preferably 0.06 to 0.25 of weight based on the total weight of the composition.Ethylene Polymers The copolymers which may be prepared in the process of the present invention are hydrocarbon copolymers of a major mol percent 85 of ethylene, and a minor mol percent 15 of one or more C3 to C8alpha olefine. The C3 toC8alpha olefines should not contain any branching on any of their carbon atoms which is closer than the fourth carbon atom. The preferred C3 toC8alpha olefins are propylene, butene l, pentene l and hexene l and octene l. The ethylene polymers have a melt flow ration of 22 to 4 40 and preferably of 25 to C 33. The melt flow ratio value is another means of indicating the molecular weight distribution of a polymer. The melt flow ratio MFR range of 25 to a 33 thus corresponds to a Mw Mn value range of about 2.7 to 4.1. The polymers herein include aMw Mn value of the range of about 2.2 to 4.5. The melt index ranges from 0.1 to 100 gm 10min. The homopolymers have a density of about 0.960 to 0.972 and preferably of about 0.961 to 0.968. The copolymers have a density of about .910 to o.a60 and preferably 0.917 to 0.955, and most preferably, of about 0.917 to f 0.945. The density of the copolymer, at a given melt index level for the copolymer, is primarily regulated by the amount of the C3 to C8 comonomer which is copolymerized with the ethylene. In the absence of the comonomer, the ethylene would homopolymerize with a catalyst to provide homopolymers having a density of about 2 0.96. Thus, the addition of progressively larger amounts of the comonomers to the copolymers results in a progressive lowering of the density of the copolymer.The amount of each of the various C3 to Cs comonomers needed to achieve the same result will vary from monomer to monomer, under the same reaction conditions. The ethylene polymers of the present invention have an unsaturated group content of 1, and usually 0.1 to i 0.35, C C 1000 carbon atoms. The ethylene polymers of the present invention are useful for making films and molded articles. Also included in the term polymer are blends of one polymer with one or more other polymers. Illustrative of such blends are ethylene olefinic polymers with one or more of the following polypropylene, high pressure low density polyethy lene, high density polyethylene, polybutene l, and molar monomer containing olefin copolymers such as ethylene acrylic acid copolymers, etylene methyl acrylate copolymer, ethylene ethylacrylate copolymer, ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer, ethylene acrylic acid ethyl acrylate terpolymer, ethylene acrylic acid vinyl acetate terpolymer, and the like. Preferred low pressure, low density ethylene copolymers for use in the present invention include those which may be produced in accordance with the procedures set forth in U.S. PatentApplication Serial No. 892,325, filed March 3, 1978, and refiled as Serial No. 014,414 on February 27, 1979, in the names of F.J.

Goeke et al.and entitled Impregnated Polymerization Catalyst,Process for Preparing, and Use for Ethylene Copolymerizationw as well as procedures which will produce ethylene hydrocarbon copolymers with properties as heretofore described. U.S.Application Serial No. 014,414 corresponds toEuropean Patent Application No. 79100953.3 which was opened to the public on October 17, i979 asPublication No. 4646 and U.S. Application Serial No.012, 720 corresponds to European Patent ApplicationNo. 79100958.2 which was opened to the public onOctober 27, 1979 as Publication No. 4647. The disclosures of Publications Nos. 4646 and 4647 are incorporated herein by reference. Other low pressure, low density ethylene polymers preferred for use in the present invention are those which may be prepared as described in U.S.Patent 4,011,382, entitled Preparation of Low and Medium Density Ethylene Polymer in Fluid BedReactor by I.J. Levine et al., the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. The ethylene polymers may be used in the form of powders, pellets, granules, or any other form that can be fed to an extruder.Extrudable Compositions The extrudable compositions of the invention may be used in any of the forms of such compositions which are commonly employed in the extruded film arts, such as compounds modified with various slip and anti block additives for specific end use applications. These extrudable compositions are thermoplastic in nature. In addition to the ethylene polymer, DBS and stearate compound, the compositions of the present invention may contain other adjuvant materials which are commonly employed in ethylene polymer based extrudable compositions.Such other adjuvants would include plasticizers, fillers, pigments, lubricants, slip agents, antioxidents, stabilizers, modifiers and similar materials. The fillers which may be used in the ethylene polymer based extrudable compositions of the present invention are the fillers which are commonly used with such polymers. The fillers are used in amounts which corresponds to about .1 to 20 percent by weight, based on the weight of the olfein polymer. Such fillers would include materials such as clays, diatomaceous earth, calcium silicates and others known in the art. The plasticizers which may be employed in the ethylene polymer based extrudable compositions ofthe present invention are the plasticizers which are commonly used with such polymers. The plasticizers are used in amounts which would correspond to about 1 to 25 percent weight based on the weight of ethylene polymer. Such plasticizers would include material such as phtalates, phosphates, adipates, azelates, amine based polyols, and a number of other similar products. The lubricants which are commonly employed in the ethylene polymer based extrudable compositions are the lubricants which are commonly used with such polymers. The lubricants are used in amounts which correspond to about 0.01 to 0.2 percent by weight of lubricant agent based on the weight of the ethylene polymer. Examples of such lubricants are fatty acid amides such as stearamide, oleamide, behenamide and erucamide.Extruding Conditions Film The films produced by the compositions of the present invention may be extruded by tubular blown film extrusion such as disclosed in U.S.Patent 4,243,619 issued January 6, 1981. In the patent process a molten, narrow molecular weight distribution ethylene hydrocarbon copolymer is extruded through an annular die having a die gap of greater than about 50 mils to less than about 120 mils, preferably greater than about 50 mils to less than about 100 mils. The copolymer is extruded at a temperature of about 3250C to about 500OF , and is extruded in an upward vertical direction in the form of a tube although it can be extruded downward or even sideways. After extrusion of the molten polymer through the annular die, the tubular film is expanded to the desired extent, cooled, or allowed to cool and flattened. The tubular film is flattened by passing the film through a collapsing frame and a set of nip rolls.These nip rolls are driven, thereby providing means for withdrawing the tubular film away from the annular die. A positive pressure of gas, for example, air or nitrogen, is maintained inside the tubular bubble. As is known in the operation of conventional film processes, the pressure of the gas is controlled to give the desired degree of expansion of the tubular film. The degree of expansion, as measured by the ratio of the fully expanded tube circumference to the circumference of the die annulus, is in the range 1 1 to 6 1 and preferably, 1 1 to 4 1. As the ethylene hydrocarbon copolymer exits the annular die, the extrudate cools and its temperature falls below its melting point and it solidifies. The optical properties of the extrudate change as crystallization occurs and a frost line is formed. The position of this frost line above the annular die is a measure of the cooling rate of the copolymer film. This cooling rate has a very marked effect on the optical properties of the ethylene hydrocarbon copolymer film produced herein. Crystallization effects, as discussed previously, dominate the optical properties of the ethylene polymer films described herein. Blown film process parameters have a very pronounced effect on the. optical properties of these films. The films produced by the composition of the present invention are usually prepared in tubing or sheeting which are about 0.1 to 10 mils thick.MOLDED ARTICLES The articles produced from the composition of the present invention are prepared by methods well known in the art, such as by injection molding, rotomolding and blow molding. Articles such as lids, closures, food or garbage containers, dishpans and toys are produced by ram or screw injection molding processes well known in the art. For example, Renfrew Morgan, Polyetylene, second edition, IntersciencePublisher, 1960 pages 549 570 describes injection molding of polyethylene. The articles of the present invention are molded in a standard injection molding machine where the ethylene polymer is heated at a temperature of from about 1800 to 2700C in the machine until plasticized and is then injected at a gauge pressure of from about 500 to about 2000 psi into a mold cavity of desired configuration. The ethylene polymer is cooled in the mold cavity at temperatures of from about 150 to about 600C until it conforms to the shape of the mold cavity. The molded article is then removed from the mold. Articles such as bottles and containers are molded by injection or extrusion blow molding processes which are well known in the prior art.For example, Rent row Morgan, supra, pages 571 to 579, described blow molding of polyethylene. In blow molding, the ethylene polymer is heated as previously described in the machine and the resin is then injected into a mold cavity kept a temperature near the melting point of the resin preferably from about 800 to about 1300C, and formed into a tubular shape called a parison which is then transferred to another cooler mold of desired shape and forced under air pressure against the walls of the mold cavity and cooled. The article is then removed from the mold. Extrusion blow molding consists of, for example, extruding a length of tube of the ethylene polymer into a split mold which is then closed to seal the tube at either top or bottom. The tube is then inflated to the internal contour of the mold, for example, by air pressure introduced into the extrudate. The.molding is then cooled, the mold opened and the component ejected. Articles such as large toys and industrial size food and garbage containers are principally made by rotomolding instead of injection molding, because of the intricate shapes involved and the superior economics the process offers for low volume production. The process of rotomolding is well known in the art and is described in Encyclopedia of PolymerScience and Technology, Volume 9, IntersciencePublisher, 1968, pages 118 137. In this process either powdered resin or fine resin particles are placed into the metal mold cavity which is then rotated in a hot oven 500 to 6000F until the resin melts and coats the inside of the mold cavity. The metal mold containing the molten resin is then transferred to a cooling means wherein it is cooled until the molten resin has solidified and conformed to the shape of the mold cavity. Before processing according to the methods heretofore described, the ethylene polymer can be mixed or blended with various additives and then added to the molding machine or the ethylene polymer can be added directly to the molding machine together with any additives. The shape of molded articles from ethylene polymer include lids, closures, food and garbage containers, dishpans, bottles, toys, hinges, etc.Properties of Ethylene Polymers, Films and Articles The properties of the ethylene polymers, film and articles produced therefrom, were determined by the following methods Density ASTM D 1505 Plaque is conditioned for one hour at 1000C to approach equilibrium crystallinity reported as gms cm3Melt Index ASTM D 1238 Condition E MI measured at 1900C reported as grams per 10 minutes.Flow Index ASTff D 1238 Condition F ELM measured at 10 times the weight used in the melt index test above reported as grams per 10 minutes.Melt Flow Flow Index Melt Index.Ratio MFR Molecular Gel Permeation ChromatographyWeight styragel column packaging, poreDistribution size packing sequence is 10 , Mw Mn 105, 104, 103, 60An solvent Perchlorethylene at 1170C.

The following examples are illustrative of the present invention and are not included as a limitation of the scope thereof. Example 1Preparation of Polymer Resins A. Three low pressure, low density ethylene butene l copolymer resins were prepared according to the procedure disclosed in SouthAfrican Patent Publication No. 79 0136S, publishedSeptember 22, 1980, entitled Process for MakingFilm From Low Density Ethylene HydrocarbonCopolymer by W.A. Fraser et al. The properties of the ethylene butene l copolymer resins were determined by methods disclosed previously.

The second ethylene butene l copolymer resin, designated 2 , had the following properties a melt index of 2.0 a MFR of 28 a density of 0.918 gm cm3 and a catalyst residue in ppm of Ti 3,A1 80, Si 97 and Cl 16. The third ethylene butene l copolymer resin 3 had the following properties a melt index of 50 a MFR of 26 a density of 0.926 gm cm3 and a catalyst residue in PPM of Ti 3, A1 89, Si 56 and C1 13. B. A low pressure high density ethylene homopolymer resin designated as 4 was prepared according to the procedure disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,303,771 issued on December 1, 1981. The properties of the homopolymers were determined by the methods described previously. The homopolymer resin had the following properties a melt index of 7 a MFR of 26 a density of 0.967 gm cm3 and a catalyst residue in ppm of Ti 4, Al 60, Si 100, and C1 45. Resin A or resin B was used in the resin compositions of all the subsequent examples herein.Examples 2 19 An ethylene butene l, 2MI, density .918 gm cm3 copolymer prepared as in Example 1, and designated 2 was compounded using a smallBrabender mixer with dibenzylidene sorbitol DBS and co ingredients under a five minute mixing cycle at 1500 and 2100C. All ingredients were simultaneously added and compounded in the 40 gram Brabender. The compounded products were subsequently compression molded into plaques 4 x4 , 20 mils at 170, 190 and 2200C, respectively.

Both masterbatches were produced using a 6.0 lb. Banbury with 2.0 MI 0.918 density ethylene butene l copolymer as the base masterbatch resin. The first masterbatch contained 4.08 DBS, while the second masterbatch contained 4.0 wt. DDS and 2.8 wt. zinc stearate. Dryblends of the base resin and granulated masterbatches were produced at 3.5 and 5.0 letdown, respectively.The dryblends were subsequently fabricated into tubular films using a 24 1 L D, 1 1 2 inch Sterling extruder fitted with a standard 24 1 L D PE mixing screw. The die was a 3 inch Sano spiral pin configuration with an enlarged 60 mil die gap. Films were produced at an 8 9 inch frostline height at 50 RPM 25 lbs hr at 1.5 mil gauge, 3 1 BUR from the standard ethylene butene l copolymer control and blends with 3.5 and 5.0 wt of the DBS and DBS plus zinc stearate masterbatches.

Both masterbatches were produced using a 6.0 lb. Banbury with a 2,0 MI, 0.918 density ethylene butene l copolymer as the base masterbatch resin.The first masterbatch contained 4.0 DBS, while the second masterbatch contained 4.0 wt. DBS and 2.8 wt. zinc stearate. Dryblends of the base resin and granulated masterbathes were produced at .3.5 and 5.0 letdown, respectively. The dryblends were subsequently fabricated into tubular films using a 24 1 L D, 1 1 2 inch terling extruder fitted with a standard 24 1 L D polyethylene mixing screw. The die was a 3 inch ano spiral pin configuration with an enlarged 60 mil die gap. Films were produced at an 8 9 inch frostline height at 50 RPM 25 lbs hr at 1.5 mil gauge, 3 1 BUR from the standard ethylene butene l copolymer control and blends with 3.5 and S.0 wt of the DBS and DBS plus zinc stearate masterbatches.

All ingredients were then simultaneously compounded. The compounded products were subsequently compression molded into plaques 4x4 inch, 20 mils at 1500 and 2200C., respectively. The following formulations were investigated ethylene butene l copolymer with 30 ppm DBS, and ethylene butene l copolymer with 30 ppmDBS and 1400 ppm zinc stearate. The appearance and haze of the plaques were recorded. The data are summarized in Table IV and indicate that 1400 ppm of zinc stearate alone does not reduce the haze of compression molded low density plaques vis a vis a control Examples 30, 31 vs. 32, 33 .

All ingredients were simultaneously added and coçxunded in the 40 gram capacity Brabender.The compounded products were subsequently compression molded into plaques 4 x 4 in. x 20 mil at 170 , 190 and 2200C, respectively. The following formulations were investigated high density narrow molecular weight distribution ethylene homopolymer containing 2200 ppm DBS and a high density narrow molecular weight distribution ethylene homopolymer containing 2200 ppm DBS and 1200 ppm zinc stearate.The appearance and the haze of the plaques were recorded. The data is summarized in Table VI. As demonstrated in Table VI, 2200 ppm alone of DBS can under certain mixing and molding conditions generate clearer high density plaques see Example 38, 43 compared to a control withoutDBS. However, the incorporation of 1200 ppm zinc stearate with the 2200 ppm DBS generated clearer plaques under a greater set of mixing and molding conditions. see Examples 47, 48, 49, 5Q, and 52 T A B L E VI EMI33.1 plaque SEP plaque tb Example SEP No. SEP Composition SEP Tmix C SEP Tmold C SEP Appearance SEP Haze C tb 37 SEP high SEP density SEP polyethylene SEP 170 SEP 170 SEP almost SEP clear SEP 64.4 tb tb 38 SEP 2200 SEP ppm SEP DBS SEP SEP 190 SEP clear SEP 60.6 tb 39 SEP SEP 220 SEP almost SEP clear SEP 64.1 tb 40 SEP 190 SEP 170 SEP amlmost SEP clear SEP 63.6 tb 41 SEP SEP 190 SEP hazy SEP 64.3 tb 42 SEP SEP SEP 220 SEP hazy SEP 65.6 tb 43 SEP 220 SEP 170 SEP clear SEP 59.7 tb 44 SEP SEP 190 SEP hazy SEP 67.7 tb 45 SEP SEP 220 SEP hazy SEP 71.6 tb 46 SEP high SEP density SEP polyethylene SEP SEP 170 SEP 170 SEP almost SEP clear SEP 62.6 tb 47 SEP 2200 SEP ppm SEP DBS SEP SEP SEP 190 SEP clear SEP 57.6 tb 48 SEP 1200 SEP ppm SEP zinc SEP stearate SEP SEP 220 SEP clear SEP 57.8 tb 49 SEP 190 SEP 170 SEP almost SEP clear SEP 63.3 tb 50 SEP SEP 190 SEP clear SEP 57.4 tb 51 SEP SEP 220 SEP clear SEP 60.0 tb 52 SEP SEP 220 SEP 170 SEP clear SEP 61.8 tb 53 SEP SEP 190 SEP hazy SEP 68.2 tb 54 SEP SEP 220 SEP hazy SEP 69.5 tb Example 55, 56 A Differential Scanning Calorimetry DSC crystallization time measurement was used to determine the magnitude of the reduction in the concentration of DBS required to produce improved clarity with the addition of zinc stearate to said ethylene polymer. The technique measures the time taken for a resin melt to reach maximum crystallization rate under a given degree of supercooling.Increasing the degree of supercooling decreases the crystallization time. If one tries to crystallize a polymer near its melting point small degree of supercooling , the crystallization time becomes exceedingly long. Using the DSC, a small specimen is heated at 100 minute up to 1500C, held at that temperature maximum DSC temperature to ensure complete relaxation of any stress and then cooled at 1600C min to the desired crystallization temperature. Since the DSC is a very sensitive calorimeter, it can precisely monitor the energy liberated during the crystallization process. The time taken to reach the maximum crystallization rate is designated the crystallization time Time0 . Various concentration of DBS ranging from 30 ppm to 2000 ppm were compounded with an ethylene butene l copolymer, 2 MI .918 density designated as 2 using a small Brabender at 1500C and analyzed via the DSC crystallization time technique. In addition, various concentrations of DBS ranging from 30 ppm to 2000 ppm with 1400 ppm zinc stearate in the 2 MI .918 density ethylene butene l copolymer were also studied. The maximum DSC temperature were set at 1500C and 2200C respectively ta simulate the effect of higher temperatures on the crystallization time. We have found that when the crystallization time is below 125 seconds at 1160C crystallization temperature, clear compression molded plaque will be produced if the compression molding temperature equals the maximum DSC temperature. As indicated in Table VII temperature has a dramatic effect on the effectiveness of DBS. At higher temperatures, higher concentrations of DBS are required. However, with the addition of zinc stearate lower levels of DBS can be used to generate improved clarity.

All ingredients were simultaneously added and compounded in the 40 gramBrabender. The compounded products were subsequently compression molded into plaques 4 x4 , 20 mils at 170, 190 and 2200C, respectively.The following formulations were investigated ethylene butene l copolymer plus 1400 ppm dibenzylidene sorbitol ethylene butene l copolymer plus 1400 ppm dibenzylidene sorbitol plus 1400 ppm magnesium stearate ethylene butene l copolymer plus 1400 ppm dibenzylidene sorbitol plus 1400 ppm calcium stearate ethylene butene l copolymer plus 1400 ppm DBS plus 1400 ppm aluminum stearate. The appearance and the haze of the plaques were recorded. The data is summarized in Table VI II. As indicated in Table VIII, Examples 57 62 1400 ppm DBS and Examples 75 80 1400 ppm DBS and 1400 ppm aluminum stearate did not improve the haze of compression molded plaques under any mixing and molding conditions. The introduction of 1400 ppm magnesium stearate Examples 63 68 or 1400 ppm calcium stearate Examples 69 74 generated an improvement in haze. However, at equal ppm concentration, zinc stearate Table Z is more effective in improving the optical properties of said ethylene butene l copolymer containing 1400 ppmDBS than either magnesium stearate, calcium stearate, or aluminum stearate.
