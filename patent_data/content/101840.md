# Cigarette holder with tar collecting means.

## Abstract
A cigarette holder substantially made of a integrally formed body member which includes an outer hollow cylindrical portion 2 with both of its ends open, the inner space within which is divided into a radially larger bore 3b and a radially smaller bore 3a by a transverse dividing wall portion 4 , from which an inner cylindrical portion 6 extends coaxially for a certain distance into the radially smaller bore 3a so as to define a narrow annular space 5 therebetween. An outer peripheral portion of the dividing wall portion is pierced with a groove 13 which extends axially from the radially larger bore side of the dividing wall portion toward the radially smaller bore beyond the thick ness of the dividing wall portion, the groove 13 having a radial depth larger than a half of the difference of the diameters of the radially larger and smaller bores, thereby defining a restriction passage 9 which generates a high speed flow of smoke towards the outer peripheral surface 6a of the inner cylindrical member 6 . The radially larger bore 3b is adapted to receive a cigarette.
