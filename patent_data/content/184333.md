## Abstract
Sound waves received by microphones 12 and 14, and optionally 16 and 18 are transformed into electrical output signals which are applied by way of cable 28 to finger stimulators 20 to 26. Each of the finger stimulators is designed to receive the tip of one finger to which mechanical vibrations are transmitted by means of a coil 106 interacting with a magnetic core 112 and to which electrical impulses are applied by electrodes 116 and 118 to facilitate discrimination of stimuli at high and low frequencies. In an alternative system an implant in the wrist receives signals from an external transmitter and applies electrical stimuli to tactile sensory nerves.
