# POSTING APPARATUS

## Abstract
The difficulty of withdrawing an inner container, from inside an outer container 49 engaged with a port 20 in the wall 11 of a radioactive cell 12 , into the cell, and the disadvantages of carrying a port door 25 on a swinging hinge arrangement inside the cell, are overcome by provid ing the inner container as a drawer 58 which slides on the outer container 49 to a cantilevered transfer disposition in which it protrudes into the cell. In its transfer disposition the cantilevered end of the drawer carries an end closure 54 of the container and the port door 25 . A purging gas flow G can be used to keep clean the sealing surfaces 27,53 of the port and the container.
