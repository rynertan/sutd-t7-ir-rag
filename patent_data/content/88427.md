# Apparatus and method for controlling an alkylation reactor.

## Abstract
An acid alkylation process is controlled so as to maintain a desired ratio of isobutane to olefins in a fluid stream flowing to the alkylation reactor and to maintain a desired acid to hy drocarbon ratio in the alkylation reactor. Also, if parallel alkyla ton reactors are utilized, the flow rate of the olefin stream to one of the alkylation reactors is manipulated so as to maintain a balanced loading on the parallel alkylation reactors. Such control results in improved quality of the alkylate produced and also improves the amount of alkylate produced from a particu lar amount of fluid to the alkylation reactor.
