# AZODYESTUFFS DERIVED FROM 5 MEMBERED HETEROCYCLIC AMINES AND AROMATIC COUPLERS CONTAINING SULPHO GROUPS, OR SALTS THEREOF AND THEIR USE IN DYEING POLYAMIDE FIBRES

## Abstract
Mono azo dyes are derived from certain diazotized 5 membered heterocyclic amines and certain aniline, 1,2,3,4 tetrahydroquinoline and benzomorpholine couplers containing sulphoalkyl groups. The amine and coupler nuclei may be substituted. These dyes impart fast violet to blue shades to polyamide fibres.
