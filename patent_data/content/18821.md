## Description
Temperature Control for Liquid in a Container The prevent invention relates to a temperature control system for liquid in a container such as in a washing machine and more particularly, to a temperature control system which alternately provides for the flow of hot water and cold water to the washing machine to maintain the temperature of water in the machine at a predetermined temperature which may be infinitely varied. Temperature control systems for washing machines are known in the art. One example of a known temperature controller is disclosed in the U.S. Patent 3,772,900 which discloses a temperature controller which energizes one of the hot or cold water valves to direct water to the washing machine until a sensor indicates that the water in the machine is at the desired temperature. Other examples of temperature controls for washing machines are disclosed in the U.S.Patent 3,707,856, U.S. Patent, 3,349,579 and U.S. Patent 3,521,470. In the known prior art washing machines, the water temperature is not infinitely variable. Generally, washing machines have three temperature settings which are hot, cold and warm. When the temperature is set at hot only water from the hot water line is added to the machine and when the temperature is set at cold only water from the cold water line will be added to the machine. When the temperature is set at warm a predetermined mixture of cold and hot water will be blended. It should be appreciated that the temperature of water in the hot and cold water lines varies and that the temperature of water in the machine will also vary due to the fact that the water is blended by volume irrespective of the temperature of water in the hot and cold water lines.It has been found that 90 of the energy required to wash a load of clothes is utilized heating the water. Thus, if the water temperature can be accurately controlled the energy requirements of the machine can be reduced. The present invention provides a new and improved control for liquid in a container such as a washing macnine for controlling the temperature of water in the container by alternately providing for the flow of hot water to the chamber through a first passageway and cold water to the chamber through a second passageway.The control includes first and second valves for controlling the flow of hot and cold water, respectively, to the container, a reference signal generator for establishing a reference signal indicative of the desired temperature of water in the container, and a temperature sensor for sensing the actual temperature of the water in the container and establishing a feedback signal indicative thereof. A first comparator is provided responsive to the reference signal and the feedback signal for establishing an error signal indicative of the difference between the actual temperature and the desired temperature of water in the chamber. A periodic signal generator establishes a periodic input signal.A second comparator is responsive to the error signal and the periodic input signal and establishes a periodic output signal having a portion representative of on time and a portion representative of off time during each cycle. The periodic output signal has a frequency dependent upon the frequency of the periodic input signal and a duty cycle dependent upon the error signal. Means is provided responsive to the periodic output signal for energizing the first valve to effect the flow of hot water to the container during the on time and for energizing the second valve to effect the flow of cold water to the container during the off time of each cycle of the periodic output signal. The present invention provides for accurate inifinite control of the water temperature irrespective of the temperature of the water in the hot and cold water lines. Also, since the hot and cold water valves are either in their open or closed status, there is no need for proportional controls to open one of the water valves to less than its fully open state. Thus, a low cost system can be provided with reduced energy requirements relative to the known prior art systems. One way of carrying out the invention is described below with reference to the drawings, which illustrate only one specific embodiment, in which FIGURE 1 is a schematic illustration of the control system of the present invention, and FIGURE 2 is a timing diagram more fully illustrating the periodic wae form established by the ramp generator and the periodic gate signals directed to the gates of the triacs for energizing the hot and cold water valves. Referring to the figures, and more particularly Figure 1, a washing machine 10 is schematically illustrated. The washing machine 10 includes a chamber or container 12 therein which is adapted to be filled with water of a predetermined temperature. A first fluid passageway 14 is provided for delivering hot water to the chamber 12 and a second fluid passageway 16 is provided for directing flow of cold water to the chamber 12. A valve 18 is disposed in the hot water line 14 for controlling the flow of water therethrough. The hot water valve 18 includes a coil, schematically illustrated at 20, to effect opening of the valve upon energization thereof in a well known manner. A cold water valve 22 is disposed in the cold water input line 16 to control the flow of cold water therethrough into the chamber 12.A coil, schematically illustrated at 24, is associated with the cold water valve 22 and effects opening thereof to allow the flow of cold water through the line 16 upon energization of the coil 24. The hot water valve 18 and cold water valve 22 are alternately opened and closed preferably at a fixed frequency for varying periods of time to vary the temperature of the water in the chamber 12. Assuming normal water temperatures in the hot and cold water lines, if it is desired to raise the temperature of the water in the chamber 12, the hot water valve 18 and cold water valve 22 will be alternately opened and closed with the hot water valve being held open for a longer period of time than the cold water valve 22. If it is desired to lower the temperature of the water in the chamber 12, then the hot and cold water valves 18 and 22 will be alternately opened and closed with the cold water valve being held open for a longer period of time than the hot water valve.If it is desired to maintain the temperature in the chamber 12 at a constant temperature, halfway between the temperature of the water in the cold water line and the temperature of the water in the hot water line, then the hot water valve 18 and cold watc. valve 22 will be alternately turned on and off with the period for conduction of the hot water valve 18 equalling the period of conduction for the cold water valve 22. The relative periods of conduction of the hot and cold water valves will vary dependent upon the actual temperatures of water in the hot and cold water lines and the desired temperature of the water in the chamber 12. The control for controlling the energization of the valves 18, 22 includes a reference signal generator 26 which establishes a reference signal on line 28 having a magnitude indicative of the desired temperature of the water in the chamber 12. The reference signal generator 26 can be manually varied by the washing machine operator to vary the magnitude of the signal on line 8 to thereby vary the desired set point temperature for the water in the chamber 12. A sensor 30 is suitably located in the washing machine 10 to sense the temperature of the water in the chamber 12. The sensor 30 establishes a signal on line 32 indicative of the actual water temperatures sensed by the sensor 30. The sensor may be of any convenient type, for example, a thermocouple, thermistor, or semiconductor device as will be known to those having skill in the art.Additionally, while the sensor is disclosed located in the chamber 12, it is also contemplated that the sensor 30 could be located at other locations for sensing the temperature of water in the machine. For example, the sensor could be located in a valve body of a valve for mixing the hot and cold water or it could be located at the outlet to the mixing valve. Thus, when the sensor is referred herein to being located in the chamber 12 other convenient locations are also contemplated. A comparator 34 is operable to compare the signal on line 28 indicative of the desired temperature of the water with the signal on line 32 indicative of the actual sensed temperature of the water in the chamber 12. The comparator 34 establishes an error signal on line 36 which has a magnitude which is indicative of the difference between the desired temperature of the water and the actual sensed temperature of the water. A ramp generator 40 is provided for establishing a periodic wave form on the output line 42 thereof. The ramp generator 40 establishes a ramp wave form 44, schematically illustrated in Figure 2, which has a constant frequency and constant magnitude. The frequency of the wave ramp wave form 44 will control the frequency at which the hot water valve 18 and cold water valve 22 are cycled. Typically, the frequency of cycling of the hot and cold water valves will be between 1 and 6 cycles per minute. It has been found that more frequent cycling of the valves 18,22 is not required to maintain a desired water temperature in the chamber 12. Additionally, more frequent cycling of the valves 18, 22 causes undesirable wear of the valves. The ramp wave form on line 42 and the error signal on line 36 are directed to inputs of a comparator 46. The output of the comparator 46 on line 48 will be a square wave as is schematically illustrated at 50 having a frequency dependent upon the frequency of the wave form 44 established by the ramp generator 40 and a duty cycle dependent on the magnitude of the error signal on line 36. Each cycle of the square wave will have a portion 52 during which the square wave is high and which is representative of on time and a portion 54 during which the square wave is low and which is representative of eoff time . The on portion 52 and the off portion 54, when added together, form one cycle with the cycle having a frequency equal to the frequency of the ramp wave form 44.The duty cycle of the periodic wave form 50 is equal to the on time or portion 52 of the wave form 50 as compared to time it takes to complete one cycle of the wave form 50. Wave form 50, as is schematically illustrated in Figure 1, has a duty cycle of approximately 50 , meaning that it is high 50 of the time and low 50 of the time. The periodic output from comparator 46 is utilized to alternately effect energization of the coil 20 associated with the hot water valve 18 during the on time of each cycle of the wave form 50 and energization of the coil 24 associated with the cold water valve 22 during the off time of each cycle of the periodic wave form 50. If DC power is utilized for energizing the coils 20,24 of the valves 18,22, then the wave form 50 can be applied to suitable switching means to effect energization thereof. In the preferred embodiment, it is desirable to use anAC power source 56 to effect energization of the coils 20,24 of the valves 18,22. A triac 58 is series connected in a line 60 with the coil 20 for the hot water valve 18 and a triac 62 is series connected in a line 64 with the coil 24 for the cold water valve 22. An output line 66 from the AC power source 56 connects the lines 60 and 64 to the AC power source 66. When triac 58 conducts, AC power will be applied through lines 66 and 60 through the triac 58 to effect energization of the coil 20 for the hot water valve 18 to thereby provide for the flow of hot water through the passageway 14 and valve 18 to the chamber 12. When triac 62 conducts, AC power will be applied through the lines 66 and 64 through the triac 62 to the coil 24 to open the cold water valve 22 and provide for the flow of cold water through the passageway 16 to the chamber 12. Triac 62 is provided with a gate 68 which is connected via line 70 to line 60 above triac 58. When triac 58 is conducting, no signal will be applied along line 70 to the gate 68 of triac 62 and triac 62 will not conduct. When triac 58 is not conducting, a periodic AC wave form from the AC power source 56 will be applied from line 60 along line 70 to the gate 68 of triac 62. The AC wave form will apply periodic signals to the gate 68 of triac 62 to effect continuous conduction of triac 62 as long as gate signals are applied to gate 68. Subsequent conduction of triac 58 will remove the gate signals from line 70 to the gate 68 of triac 62 to thereby cause triac 62 to cease conduction when the potential of the AC wave form on line 64 goes to zero. A zero crossing detector 72 is provided to ensure continuous conduction of triac 58 during the on time of the periodic wave form 50. The triac 58 will have a tendency to turn off when the AC wave form applied thereto zones through zero unless periodic signals are applied to the gate 78 of the triac 58 to keep it from extinguishing every time the AC wave form applied thereto goes to zero. The zero crossing detector 72 includes an input line 74 from the AC power source 56 having a signal thereon which is indicative of the frequency of the AC power source 56. The periodic output signal 50 indicative of the error between the actual sensed water temperature and the desired water temperature is applied on line 48 to an input of the zero crossing detector 72. The zero crossing detector operates to generate a series of periodic pulses which are applied along line 76 to the gate 78 of triac 58. The periodic pulses generated by the zero crossing detector occur every time the AC wave form from the AC power source 56 goes through zero and the periodic wave form 50 on line 48 is high. The periodic pulses on line 76 are schematically illustrated at 80. When the periodic wave form 50 is low the zero crossing detector will not establish the periodic pulses 80 on line 76 and triac 58 will not conduct. This is exemplified by the low portion 82 of the wave form 80.When the wave form 80 is low, as at 82, the triac 58 will not conduct and the triac 62 will conduct. Figure 2 more fully illustrates the proportional control technique utilized for alternately opening the hot water valve 18 and cold water valve 22 during each cycle of the wave form 0. In Figure 2, the ramp wave form 44 is illustrated to indicate the time period employed for one cycle. Each toothed segment of the wave form 44 is indicative of the time period required for one cycle of the square wave 50. During each cycle, for a portion of the cycle, the hot water valve 18 will be opened and the cold valve 22 will be closed and for the remainder of the cycle, the hot water valve 18 will be closed and the cold valve 22 will be opened. In the first cycle illustrated in Figure 2 by the ramp wave form 44 , the sensor 30 senses the temperature of the water in the chamber 12 to be below the set point set by the reference signal generator 26. In this particular instance, the magnitude of the error signal between the desired temperature and the actual sensed temperature is such as to provide a duty cycle of 75 for wave form 50. In this case, it is desired to have the hot water valve opened and the cold water valve 22 closed during 75 of each cycle and the cold water valve 22 opened and the hot water valve 18 closed during the remaining 25 of the time period. Thus, the gate signals to triac 58 occur during 75 of the time period for one cycle as is illustrated and the gate signals to triac 62 occur during the remaining 25 of the time period. The second cycle, illustrated in Figure 2, occurs during the ramp wave form 44 . In this case the sensor 30 senses the temperature of the water in chamber 12 to be equal to the set point established by the reference signal generator 26. In this instance, it is desired to have the hot water valve 18 opened and the cold water valve 22 closed during 50 of the cycle and the cold water valve 22 opened and the hot water valve 18 closed during the remaining 50 of the cycle. In this case, it can be seen that the gate signals to triac 58 occur during 50 of the cycle and the gate signals for triac 62 occur during the other 50 of the cycle. The last example shown in Figure 2, during the cycle indicated by the ramp wave form 44 , discloses the case where the sensor 30 senses the temperature of the water in chamber 12 to be above the set point as established by the reference signal generator 26. In this case, the error signal on line 36 effects opening of the hot water valve 18 and closing of cold water valve 22 during 25of the cycle and the opening of cold water valve 22 and closing of hot water valve 18 during the remaining 75 of the cycle. As can be seen fromFigure 2, the gate signals to triac 58 occur during 255 of the cycle and the gate signals to triac 62 occur during the remaining 75 of the cycle. It should be appreciated that the present control provides a closed loop feedback control in which the water temperature in the washing machine is sensed, compared with a reference and the percent of on time of the hot and cold fill valves varied in proportion to the error to produce the desired water temperature in the washing machine. The control will operate to continuously cycle the hot and cold water valve once during each cycle of the periodic waveform 50 which, in the preferred embodiment, occurs between one and six times per minute. Thus, the hot and cold water valves will be each cycled between one and six times per minute. The present control allows the temperature of water in the machine to be infinitely varied between the temperature of water in the hot water line and the temperature of the water in the cold water line by modulating the flow of hot and cold water to the chamber 12. This provides a great advantage and energy savings over conventional machines which merely blend hot and cold water irrespective of their temperatures.Additionally, the present control provides for the proportional control of the water flow into the chamber 12 by blending the hot and cold water during periodic increments thereby providing an accurate control with an extremely quick response time. While the control has been described as modulating both the hot and cold water flow it should be appreciated that if only warm water was required the cold water flow could be continuous and the hot water flow could be modulated. If basically hot water was required the hot water flow could be constant and the cold water flow could be modulated. If, for example, only warm water was required the sdme basic structures could be utilized, except that the coil 24 for the cold water valve would be removed from the series circuit with triac 62 and would be continuously energized anytime that it was desired to add water to the machine.The hot water valve 18 would then be periodicallu cycled once during each period of square wave 50 and would be energized for a period during each cycle which was dependent upon the error signal on line 36 indicative of the difference between the sensed temperature and the desired temperature of the water in chamber 12. While the control has been shown as utilized with a washing machine, it should be appreciated that it could be applied to other systems in which it is desired to infinitely control the temperature of a liquid in a container by adding liquids of at least two different temperatures together and varying the proportions of the different temperature liquids to control the temperature of the liquid in the container. From the foregoing, it should be apparent that a new and improved control for a washing machine for controlling the temperature of water in the machine by alternately providing for the flow of hot water and cold water to the machine has been provided. The control includes a first valve for controlling the flow of hot water to the machine and a second valve for controlling the flow of cold water to the machine.A reference signal generator establishes a reference signal indictive of the desired temperature of the water and a temperature sensor is provided for sensing the actual temperature of the water and establishing a feedback signal indicative thereof. A first comparator is provided responsive to the reference signal and the feedback signal for establishing an error signal indicative of the difference between the desired temperature and the actual temperature of the water in the machine. A periodic signal generator establishes a periodic input signal and a second comparator is responsive to the periodic input signal and the error signal for establishing a periodic output signal having a portion representative of one time and a portion representative of off time during each cycle. The periodic output signal has a frequency which is dependent upon the frequency of the periodic input signal and a duty cycle dependent upon the error signal. A means is provided responsive to the periodic output signal for energizing the first valve to effect the flow of hot water to the machine during the on time of the periodic output signal and for energizing the second valve to effect the flow of cold water to the machine during the off time of the periodic output signal.
