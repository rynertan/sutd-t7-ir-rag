# MODIFIED UNSATURATED POLYESTER RESINS

## Abstract
This invention relates to a composition containing an unsaturated polyester prepolymer, a copolymerisable vinyl monomer and an unsaturated monocarboxylic acid. The addition of an unsaturated monocarboxylic acid to the composition improves its adhesive properties, especially in metal to metal adhesion, significantly.
