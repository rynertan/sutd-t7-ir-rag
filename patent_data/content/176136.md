# Apparatus for treating a patient with ultrasound waves and treatment head for such apparatus.

## Abstract
An apparatus for treating a patient with ultrasound waves comprises a treatment head and an amplifier 7 receiving an input signal depending on the desired intensity of the ultrasound waves and providing an electrical output signal on its output. The treatment head can be connected to the output of the amplifier 7 and contains a converter element 2 for converting the electrical signals into ultra sound waves. An adjustable element 6 is provided in the treatment head, the adjustment of which indicates the efficiency and the impedance of the converter element 2 , a controlling circuit being provided for influencing the electric al output signal in dependence on the adjustment of the adjustable element in such a manner that the treatment head delivers ultrasound waves with the desired intensity.
