# Radiation image recording and read out apparatus with object data output capability.

## Abstract
A radiation image and read out apparatus comprises a conveying means for circulating stimulable phosphor sheets 30 along a predetermined circulation path, an im age recording section 40 for recording radiation images of objects 43 on the sheets, an image read out section 50 for reading out the radiation images from the sheets, an erasing section 70 for releasing radiation energy remain ing on the sheets, a sheet position detection means 86 for outputting sheet position data, an object data input section 82 for receiving data related to the objects, and a signal output control circuit for receiving the object data and the sheet position data, storing the object data in association with the sheet positioned at the image recording section at the time the object data is received, reading out the object data stored in the memory means in association with the sheets at the time the radiation images are read out in the image read out section, and outputting data signals corre sponding to the object data for the respective sheets togeth er with signals corresponding the radiation images record ed thereon.
