## Description
This invention relates to an imaging system as defined in the precharacterizing part of claim 1. An imaging system of this type is known from US A 4,379,232. The subject matter of the invention disclosed herein is related to the subject matters of US A 4,667,239 and US A 4,622,587. In the past, imager systems have included a lens system, a detector matrix, drive and read out electronics, a video processor, a timing and control means and a display means. The detector matrix has been an array of ferroelectric elements of photoconductive elements arranged in rows and columns. With the elements in rows and columns, the detector array is X Y addressable through X Y address circuits. The detector matrix is coupled to drive and read out electronics. For an array of optoelectronic semiconductor elements, as each element is shielded by the chopper, each element is X and Y addressed by the drive electronics and charged to a reference voltage. As each successive elements is charged the preceding charged elements are receiving photons to vary the charges thereon. Then the drive circuit X Y addresses each element and the image voltages multiplexed to the video processor for processing and display. The disadvantages of the prior art imaging systems are the video signals include reset noise, and the image resolution needs improvement. Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to provide an improved imaging system whose video output signals are substantially free of reset noise. Another object of the invention is to provide an improved imaging system having substantially improved image resolution. Yet another object of the invention is to provide an imaging system substantially free of dc buildup and high speed timing complexity. A further object of the invention is to provide an imaging system having substantially improved signal to fixed pattern noise ratio. These objects are achieved by an imaging system having the features of the characterizing part of claim 1. The novel features believed to be characteristic of this invention are set forth in the appended claims. The invention itself, however, as well as other objects and advantages thereof may best be understood by reference to the following detailed description of illustrative embodiments when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which Referring now to Fig. 1 in which is shown for description purposes only and not by way of limitation an ac type infrared detector system 10. The infrared system 10 comprises an optical system 12, chopper 14, detector 16, video processor 18, display 26, and timing and control mechanism 28. The video processor 18 includes first and second monolithic difference delta frames 20 and 22 and in a second embodiment, a transversal filter 24. The optical system 12 is a combination of lenses for focusing electromagnetic wave energy emanating from a scene. The chopper 14 is a mechanical chopper for interrupting the focused energy to provide intermittent signals for an ac imager system. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that various types of lens systems and choppers exist capable of performing the desired optical functions. Referring now to Fig. 2, the detector 16 is, for example, a parallel amplifier array of 10⁴ elements 30 arranged in rows and columns of 100 elements each. Each element includes a solid state switch 32, and a capacitor 34. Switches 32 may be, for example, field effect transistors FET formed by diffusing for each switch two N type regions called the drain 36 and the source 38, side by side into the surface of a P type silicon slice. A layer of silicon oxide is grown over the surface of the silicon slice and metal strips are formed on the oxides to form the gates 40. The capacitors 34 are formed, for example, of a wafer of ferroelectric material having longitudinal lead patterns 42 and pads 44 formed on opposing major surfaces by evaporation etching techniques. The pads and the crossover portions of the lead patterns form the plates of the capacitors 34 with the ferroelectric material forming the dielectric. The gates 40 of the switches 32 of each row are connected by leads 46 to a Y addressing circuit 47 and the sources and drains are connected by leads 48 and 50, respectively, to the first plates 44 of capacitors 34 which have their second plates connected by leads 52 to V bias, and by leads 50 to the reset line 54. Sense lines 54 have opposing ends connected, respectively, to reset switches 56 and to the junction of capacitors 57 and amplifier chain circuits 58. The capacitors 57 are used to represent the inherent capacitance of the sense lines 54. The reset switches 56 are, for example, FET switches having their gates 60 connected by lead 62 to a reset voltage source not shown . The reset circuit is to charge the capacitors 34 to a reference voltage when shielded from light photons by the chopper. The amplifier chain circuits 58, described in detail hereinafter, are connected to the drains of FET switches 65. Switches 65 have their gates 63 connected to an X addressing circuit 64 and their sources connected to output lead 66. Those persons skilled in the art desiring more information concerning the details of the detector structure are referred to United States Patent US A 4,379,232 issued April 5, 1983 to George S. Hopper, assignor to Texas Instruments Incorporated. Referring now to Figs. 2 and 3a, each of the amplifier chain circuits 58 Fig. 2 includes a common source metal oxide semiconductor MOS amplifier low noise front stages 68 Fig. 3a connected to a sense lead 54 Fig. 2 . A double correlation sample filter DCS 70 is connected to the output of the low noise front stages 68. The DCS filter 70 includes a resistor 72 connected to the junction of capacitors 74 and 76. Capacitor 74 is grounded and capacitor 76 is connected to the junction of a DCS clamp 78 and amplifier 80. Clamp 78 is a FET switch which is turned on to store preamplifier noise on capacitor 74 and off to discharge the capacitor 74 into the load. Amplifier 80 is to restore the filtered signal. Amplifier 80 has its output connected to the junction of positive and negative sample and hold S H circuits 82 and 84. The positive S H circuit 82 includes a FET switch 86 connected to the junction of a capacitor 88 and amplifier 90. The capacitor 88 is grounded and the amplifier 90 has its output connected to capacitor 92. The negative S H circuit 84 includes a FET switch 94 having its source connected to the junction of capacitor 96 and inverter amplifier 98. Inverter amplifier 98 has a gain of C The total subtraction amplifier chain is to substantially cancel reset noise that exists in the detector array. Reset noise in a detector array exists owing to the uncertainty in voltage appearing across a capacitor as that capacitor is being charged by a resistive source. The root mean square RMS voltage uncertainties due to reset action on detector and sense node capacitances in a detector are given by KT C The value of these noise events are anticipated for each frame by measuring the values of the KT C Referring now to Fig. 3b, for a description of the detector matrix timing and resulting reset noise for a parallel amplifier circuit. The detector capacitance is completely reset in two parts. In the first 1 part, the reset switch 56 Fig. 2 resets C The resulting reset noises are set forth in Table 1. For a given detector element 34, reset switch 56 and address switch 32 are both on high, in waveform 62 and 46 of Figure 3b . At event 1, reset switch 32 turns off goes low, see waveform 62 of Figure 3b . Sense line noise S₁ is sampled on Sample and Hold S H circuit 82. Address or detector switch 32 turns off goes from high to low, see event 2 of waveform 46 . Sense line noise S₂ is sampled by S H circuit 84. S H circuit 84 has a gain of Cs Cd Cs times that of S H circuit 82. S H circuits 82 and 84 are summed together on the input to amplifier 104 and produce a first sum signal equal to Address or detector switch 32 is turned on at event 4 goes high, waveform 46, Figure 3b . The sense line signal plus noise S₄ is sampled by S H circuit 84. The outputs of S H circuits 82 and 84 are summed together on the input of amplifier 104 to produce a second sum signal It is necessary that a whole frame time 1 2 chopper cycle time in which all detectors must be sampled and reset exist between events 2 and 3 during which signal is accumulate on Cd. Also the C After each switching transition the voltage existing on the sense node is sampled such that sample The monolithic delta frames 20 and 22 Fig.1 are identical in construction, thus only one need be described. The monolithic delta frame Fig. 4 includes a high speed line address circuit 110. A demultiplexer 112 is connected to the high speed address circuit and to the video output of amplifier 104 Fig. 3a . A line shift means 114 Fig.4 is connected to the demultiplexer 112. A plurality 100 of buffer amplifiers 116 are connected to the line shift register 114. A buffer amplifier 116 is connected to each row of elements 118. Each element 118 includes a capacitor 120 and a switch 122. The buffer amplifier 116 is connected to one plate of the capacitor 120 and a FET switch 122 has its drain connected to a second plate of the capacitor, its gate connected by lead 124 to a slow speed column Y address register 126 and its source connected by lead 128 to a reset circuit element 130. Again there is one element 130 for each row 100 rows . Each line reset element includes a FET switch 132 having its gate connected to line reset lead 134, its source connected to the junction of lead 128 and amplifier 136 and S H circuits 138. S H circuits 138 are connected to a multiplexer 139. A high speed line address register 140 is connected to the multiplexer 139 for controlling its video output signals through video out terminal 142. Monolithic delta frame 22 has its video in terminal connected to the video out terminal 142 of monolithic delta frame 20. The monolithic delta frame 20 performs the noise storage and substraction functions while, monolithic delta frame 22 accomplishes the offset suppression and 2x 1x conversion. In monolithic delta frame 20, the use of the high impedance buffer 136 on each line 128 lowers the line parasitics and the additional capacitance created by the line buffers is substantially reduced by the source follower input stage. Becausae of this parasitic reduction, the required capacitance of the storage capacitors 120 is low so that they may be built into the metal oxide semiconductor MOS IC using standard processing hence, the name Monolithic or Integrated Delta Frame. High speed timing requirements are made worse, however, by the addition of the buffers therefore, the single line video input is demultiplexed line by line by demultiplexer 112 and then shifted by line shift means 114 into the parallel input delta frame matrix. The circuit element 130 is a high gain inverting output amplifier chain with dc feedback to suppress amplifier fixed pattern noise offsets in a dc coupled multiplexer 138. It will be appreciated by those persons skilled in the art that the 2x to 1x speed conversion rate can be made at either monolithic delta frame 20 or 22 by including S H circuits 138 having common gate connections. Referring now to Fig.s 5a 5c the detector 16 output is clocked into and out of the monolithic delta frame 20 and into the monolithic delta frame 22 at a 2X rate Fig. 5b . The output of monolithic delta frame 22 Fig.5c is clocked out at a 1X rate to the display 26. As used in Fig.s 5a and 5c the term column shift referrs to the shift command given to the low speed column address shift register 126 Fig. 4 . The arguments X and Y Fig.s 5b 5c refer to the frame and column numbers, respectively and the S to the signal. It should be noted also that because of the line shift feature of the monolithic delta frames there is a 2X line delay through each of the frames, i.e. The effect of a signal line input is not present at the outputs until one 2X line time later. As the storage action of the monolithic delta frame takes place when the line reset command is given, the timing diagram for monolithic delta frame 20 Fig. 5b indicates that the storage command for monolithic delta frame 20 takes place only after a noise line has been shifted into the matrix by the line shift pulse. Thus fullfilling the noise storage requirement when a S N line is shifted into the capacitor matrix thereof. As the noise line data from the previous frame is still present in the form of voltage on storage capacitors, only the S portion of the S N voltage data feeds through the capacitors into the sense lines. The amplifiers on each sense line passes its signal voltage on to be read out by the output multiplexer. After the noise subtraction operaton, there is no longer an S N and N line for each column of detectors, but only a signal line. Nevertheless, this signal line is still clockilng at the 2x pixel rate. To minimize display blank time the line data rate is converted to a 1x rate by the second monolithic delta frame which also subtracts fixed pattern noise. Thus this monolithic frame detector is an improvement over the Delta Frame Circuit of U.S. Patent US A 4,178,612, issued Dec. 11, 1979. The Transversal filter 24 Fig. 6 of the second embodiment is connected to the second monolithic delta frame circuit 22 Fig. 1 for peak signal detection to improve display resolution. It includes, for example, a 6 stage, 1 bit free running digital shift register 150 Fig. 6 connected to a corresponding number of sets 6 of sample and hold S H circuits 152. The sets of S H circuits are connected to the output of the second monolithic delta frame 22 Fig. 1 for receiving the video inputs and to acorresponding number of sets of line driver amplifiers 154 Fig. 6 to a corresponding number of sets of output switches 156. Each set of S H circuits 152 contains five S H circuits connected to five consecutive bits of the shift register150. Each set of line drivers 154 includes five amplifiers connected to the five S H circuits of each corresponding set thereof. Whilst, each set of output switches 156 has five transistor switches connected to the five amplifiers of each corresponding set thereof. The sixth bit of the shift register 150 is selectively connected to each set of output switches 156 for sequentially operating each set of output switches. Five voltage weighting circuits 158 are connected to the five output switches of each set of output switches, and the outputs of the weighting circuits are connected to a summer 160. The output of the summer 160 is connected to the display 26 Fig. 1 . The transversal filter 24 has its sample and hold circuits corrected to the single line video output of monolithic delta frame 22 and performs a peaking function thereon. The six stage, 1 bit shift register 150 addresses sequentially the six sets of sample and hold circuits 152 to store each pixel of information in five places simultaneously See Table 2 . The sixth bit is used to read out a set of sample and hold circuits when the correct sequence of pixels is stored in that set. The five pixels of the set read out are voltage weighted by the weighting circuits 158 and applied to the summer 160. Pixel tracing is shown in Table 3. In operation of the transversal filter Fig. 6 Table 3 , pixel 1 is stored simultaneously in S H circuits 152, stages 1,3,4,5 and 6 at pin locations 1,5,4,3, and 2, respectively the switch out bit is connected to stage 2, pin 6. The remaining pixels 2 5 for one frame together with the switch out bit are sequentially stored at succeeding pin locations of the stages for the first cycle. The number of stages determines the length of the filter. With the sixth bit of shift register, switch out of stage 1 occurs, pixels 1 5 are weighted in weighting circuits 158 and summed by summer 160 for providing peak voltage for pixel 1, while, pixel 6 is stored in positions of 5 1 of stages 2 6,respectively. Next, with each new bit, stages 2 6 are read out for weighting pixels 2 6 to complete the cycle. Next, the cycle is repeated to input pixels 7 12 and to determine their peak value and thereafter the cycle repeated until completion. Assuming Beta 0 1.63 Beta 1 0.25 and Beta 2 0.0625 and further assuming zero values for pixels 1 5, a one for pixels 6 8 and a zero for pixels 9 13 the outputs of summer 160 are 0,0, 0.25, 1.6, 0.25, 0, 0.19,0,0, .25, 1.4, and 1.4. Without the filter the corresponding values are zeros for pixels 1 5, ones for pixels 6 8 and zeros for pixels 9 12. Thus a comparison of the peak values with the digital values readily shows the improvement in resolution for the image displayed.
