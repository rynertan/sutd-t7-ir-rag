# Method of assembly for electric motor stators.

## Abstract
A stator assembly in which a stack 52, 54 of stator laminations form a stator core. The laminations are shaped to form a plurality of poles 14 projecting radially inwardly with arcuate undercut slots 18 between the poles 14 . The laminations are held together by a plurality of molded tubular insulator members 26, 28 , each comprising male 26 and female 28 sections inserted from opposite direc tions into the slots 18 and joining together telescopically within the slots 18 . Each end of the tubular member sec tions 26, 28 have integral flanges 42 which engage the ends of the poles 14 between the slots 18 . The tubular members are split lengthwise and compressed to insert them in the slots 18 . Once inserted, the tubular members expand within the slots 18 to grip the edges of the lamina tions and hold the stack 52, 54 together and in alignment. The stator coils extend through the tubular members 26, 28 within the slots 18 , the member 26, 28 providing insulation between the coils and the core.
