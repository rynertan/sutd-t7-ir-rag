## Description
HYDRATED Cacti REVERSIBLE PHASE CHANGE COMPOSITIONS XITH NUCLEATING ADDITIVES The invention relates to reversible liquid ss solid phase change compositions. More particularly, the invention relates to hydrated calcium chloride phase change compositions containing additives to modify the supercooling properties of the Caul2 liquid phase. Calcium chloride hexahydrate is in many respects suited for use as a latent heat storage mediumThe material in substantially pure form undergoes a liquid solid phase transition at about 270C 300C about 810F 860F releasing or alternately absorbing about 46 calories of heat per gram the latent heat of fusion .The material has particularly been considered for use as an encapsulated heat storage medium for use in solar energy space heating applications. Specific embodiments of such applications, for example, are taught in ReportNos. NSF RANN SE C906 FR 76 1 NSF RANN SE C906 TR 75 1 and ORO 5217 8, all of which are available from theNational Technical Information Service, Springfield,Virginia. In order to improve the material for such applications, however, additives or a series of additives have been proposed which are effective to modify the supercooling properties of hydrated calcium chloride compositions, and which are effective in small amounts such as not to alter the aavantageous heat storage properties of the material.Representative of such additives can be found in USSR Patent No. 568,669 Japanese Published Application Nos. 53 19183 51 76183 51 70193 53 070,989 and 78 009,596 and German Published application 25 50 106. Hydrated calcium chloride means reversible liquid solid phase change compositions containing from between about 40 to 54 weight percent calcium chloride on an anhydrous basis , and which apart from the additives hereof, are susceptible to supercooling. Supercooling refers to an inherent discrepancy between the temperature at which freezing initiates and the thawing temperature of a given hydrated calcium chloride composition, when cooled and heated under quiet conditions. Additive s includes, in addition to the nucleating additives specified herein, precursors of such additives nondetrimental to the purposes of the invention. The invention is the discovery of a new class of highly active nucleating additives for hydrated calcium chloride compositions. The invention particularly is a reversible liquid solid phase change composition comprising calcium chloride with water in a ratio to prepare a hydrated calcium chloride phase change composition, and which includes as an additive to such composition, one or more of the group of Bawl2, BaSO4, BaCO3, and BaO added in an amount effective to suppress the supercooling properties of the calcium chloride liquid phase. Sufficient of the additive s is present in the preferred practice to suppress supercooling to no greater than about 20C taken on an averaging basis over repeated cycles. Isomorphous nucleators act to reduce supercooling by providing crystallization nuclei of the same crystal habit and approximately the same lattice spacing as the compound being nucleated. Calcium chloride hexahydrate crystals normally have a hexagonal structure, with an I a axis of 7.9 angstrom units and a c axis of 3.9 angstroms.Although nucleation can be obtained with SrCl2 6H20 and SrB .6112O, which crystallize in the hexagonal system, it has surprisingly been discovered that Bal2, which in aqueous media normally exists as the hexahydrate which has the hexagonal crystal structure , is also a good nucleator for CaCl2 6H2O. From Table I, it will be noted that the effectiveness of nucleator cannot be determined from the crystal habit of the compounds. TABLE ICompound Crystal System a axis, c axis, c a 1. CaCl2.6H2O Hexagonal 7.9 3.9 0.49 2. SrCL2.6H2O 7.9 4.1 0.52 3. SrBr2.6H2O 8.2 4.2 0.51 4.BaI2.6H2O 8.9 4.6 0.52 To compare the effectiveness of these isomorphous nucleators, 0.5 by weight of each of the three additives was added to CaC12 6H2O, and the mixture subjected to repetitive freeze thaw cycles. The sample containing SrBr2 showed no supercooling for five cycles, but for the next five cycles the nucleator lost effectiveness and supercooling persisted. When the amount of SrBr26H20 was doubled 1.0 the additive was effective, and twelve cycles without supercooling were obtained at which point the experiment was terminated . SrCl2 seemed somewhat more effective, in that ten cycles were observed without supercooling, before the additive lost effectiveness and five cycles with supercooling occurred. Doubling the level to 1.0 again proved effective 12 cycles with no supercooling .Barium iodide proved to be most effective in these tests, however, in that 20 cycles were obtained with no supercooling at which point the experiment was terminated , and it was not necessary to double the nucleator level to achieve effectiveness. Bal2 was found to be the most effective of the isomorphous nucleators tested. Epitaxial nucleators are often also effective in reducing supercling during crystallization. The exact manner of nucleation, however, is in each case unknown or the subject of speculation. In the present invention, nucleators of this category, several of which are aqueous bases, and a few of which are approximately neutral in hydrous solution, were found to be effective. Among the neutral salts, Bay12 is known to be effective. However, BaCl2 is quite toxic to humans upon ingestion. In case of leakage, this could represent a hazard to occupants of a home heated from a CaCl2 6H20 containing heat storage device. It has now been found that BaSO4 is an excellent nucleation additive and that BaSO4 is not toxic. In fact, it is routinely administered orally as an X ray opacifier. BaSO4 is preferred to the other neutral salt epitaxial nucleators. The effective amount of the additive is determined by testing a given composition over repetitive phase change cycles. Generally, 4 beneficial effect can be shown with as little as 0.005 weight percent of an additive in the composition, d there is generally no further benefit achieved after about 2.0 weight percent of additive is incorporated into the composition. The compositions hereof are ideally packaged in individual encapsulating means for use in conjunction with solar heating systems. Exemplary of suitable and known encapsulating means for the heat storage compositions hereof are water impervious foils of plasticXmetal laminates. Also, closed cell plastic foams have been suggested in which the heat storage composStion may be encapsulated within the cells of the foam structure, as illustrated, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 4,0031426. Yet other useful encapsulating means are metal or plastic cans, such as inexpensive aerosol cans and metal or plastic pipe, such as extruded polyethylepe pipe. Further details respecting such encapsulating means are given in the Report Nos. ORO 5217 8 and NSF RANN SE C90 FR 76 1. Example The data of the table below are generated by preparing hydrated calcium chloride samples of analytical grade components, according to the ratios indicated, and wherein the mixed samples of each specified ratio are placed into a two ounce glass vial, which is then heated to 500 under agitation to achieve a uniform dispersion or admixture. A glass encased thermocouple is inserted through the cap of each vial to measure temperature changes at the center of each sample prior to, during and after freezing.The cooling temperature is controlled and maintained within the range of about 10 C 15 C. Sample No. 1, is a control sample of analytical grade CaCl2, and since supercooling tendencies prevented the control sample from freezing within the indicated cooling tempera ture range, further tests at OOC are given in the table with respect to this material.

In a third test, also at the lower temperature of OOC, complete freezing is accomplished, but only with excessive supercooling of the control composition. In contrast, the small amount of the additives of the invention, where present, change the character of the control such that supercooling is essentially close to elimination or is eliminated entirely.
