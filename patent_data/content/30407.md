# Electrical test probe for use in testing circuits on printed circuit boards and the like.

## Abstract
An electrical contact assembly 10 for electrically coupling a first contact location on a first side of a planar test fixture 12 to a second contact location on the oppos ing side of the test fixture 12 . A first tubular barrel 14 is provided for fixably mounting through a test fixture 12 . A second tubular barrel 16 is mounted within said first barrel 14 with one end 28 disposed to extend toward said first contact location. The second tubular barrel 16 is reciprocally movable within the first barrel 14 . The second barrel 16 is biased toward said first position. A plunger 18 is mounted within said second tubular barrel 16 with one end 32 disposed to extend toward said second contact location. The plunger 18 is reciprocally movable within said second barrel 16 . Bias is preferably provided by a compression spring 20 mounted between stops 24, 26 of the first 14 and second barrel 16 and a compression spring 22 mounted between stops 30 of the second barrel 16 and the plunger 18 . An electrical path is established between the end 32 of the plunger 18 and the end 28 of the second barrel 16 .
