## Description
1 BUTE.NE POLYMER AND ITS USE This invention relates to a l butene polymer which has high rigidity, excellent creep resistance, excellent impact strength and a high crystal transition speed and exhibits its excellent improved properties as a shaped article, particularly a shaped article in the form of a pipe structure, and to its use. More specifically, this invention relates to a l butene polymer containing 0 to l mole of an olefin with 2 to 20 carbon atoms other than l butene and having 1 an intrinsic viscosity Eri of from 1.5 to 4.0 dl g as measured in decalin at 1350C, 2 a molecular weight distribution, expres sed by the ratio of its weight average molecular weight mew to its number average molecular weight my , of not more than 6, and 3 an isotacticity value of at least 95 . Metallic pipes such as Zinc plated steel pipes, copper pipes or lead pipes have been used as water supplying pipes. These metallic pipes, however, have some defects, and new piping materials free from these defects have been desired. So far, plastic pipes such as pipes of polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene and poly 1 butene free from pinhole formation owing to rust or electrolytic corrosion have gained some acceptance. Because of its excellent pressure resisting strength, creep resistance to internal pressures at high temperatures, abrasion resistances, and excellent flexibility, a 1 butene polymer is among those preferred synthetic resins for use as a material for water supplying pipes. Shaped articles, particularly in the form of a pipe structure, of the l butene polymer are required to be further improved in mechanical strength such as rigidity, creep characteristics and impact strength. It is known that when solidified from its molten state, the 1 butene polymer initially assumes a pseudostable II type tetragonal system modification , and then slowly passes into a stable I type hexagonal system modification over several days.In the state of the II type, a shaped article of the 1butene polymer is soft. If, therefore, the shaped article undergoes deformation by transportation or otherwise while it is of the II type and is transformed in this state to the I type, the deformation remains in the article to make it valueless as a commercial product. Accordingly, the handling of the shaped article before complete transition to the I type is troublesome, and much expertise and labor are spent in trying to prevent the remaining of such undesirable deformation. Attempts have been made to increase the crystal transition speed of the l butene polymer. For example, it was proposed to shorten the time required for crystal transition by modifying the molding method see, for example, Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication No. 42 92 1972 , or to achieve it by using additives see, for example, Japanese Laid Open PatentPublications Nos. 36140 1982 and 92038 1982 . None have yet been able to achieve an industrially satisfactory improvement. The present inventors, from a different standpointfrom the prior attempts to use an additional means or additives, have made investigations to provide a new l butene polymer itself which has high rigidity, excellent creep resistance characteristics, and excellent impact strength and a higher crystal transition speed. These investigations have led to the discovery that there can be provided a l butene polymer characterized by having 1 an intrinsic viscosity ET of from 1.5 to 4.0 dl g, 2 a molecular weight distribution, expressed by the ratio of its weight average molecular weight mew to its number average molecular weight Mn , of not more than 6, and 3 an isotacticity value of at least 95 , and that the 1butene polymer having the characteristics 1 to 3 above overcomes the aforesaid technical problem, exhibits high rigidity, excellent creep resistance characteristics, excellent impact strength and an increased crystal transition speed and gives a shaped article, particulary in the form of a pipe structure, having excellent improved properties. It is an object of this invention to provide a l butene polymer having the aforesaid excellent improved properties and its use, particularly as a shaped article in the form of a pipe structure. The above and other objects and advantages of this invention will become more apparent from the following description. According to this invention, there is provided a l butene polymer containing 0 to 1 mole of an olefin with 2 to 20 carbon atoms other than l butene and having 1 an intrinsic viscosity of from 1.5 to 4.0 dl g as measured in decalin at 1350C, 2 a molecular weight distribution, expres sed by the ratio of its weight average molecular weight Rw to its number average molecular weight Mn , of not more than 6, and 3 an isotacticity value of at least 95. The l butene polymer is especially useful as a shaped article in the form of a pipe structure. The l butene polymer in accordance with this invention may contain up to 1 mole of an olefin having 2 to 20 carbon atoms other than l butene. Examples of such an olefin are ethylene, propylene, l pentene, l octene, l decene, l dodecene, l octadecene and 4methylpentene. The l butene polymer of the invention has an intrinsic viscosity n as measured in decalin at 135 0C of from 1.5 to 4.0 dl g, preferably from 2 to 3.5 dl g, characteristic 1 .If the intrinsic viscosity is too low beyond the specified range, the creep resistance characteristics and impact strength of the polymer are deteriorated.If it is too high beyond the specified range, the polymer has inferior moldability. Moreover, the crystal transition speed of the polymer becomes unsatisfactorily low. Hence, the intrinsic viscosity of the polymer should be within the specified range. The l butene polymer of this invention has a molecular weight distribution, expressed by the ratio of its weight average molecular weight mew to its number average molecular weight n , i.e. Mw Mn, of not more than 6, preferably from 2 to 6, more preferably from 3.3 to 5.5, characteristic 2 . If its molecular weight distribution exceeds the upper limit specified, the polymer has inferior impact strength. Hence, the molecular weight distribution should be not more than 6. Furthermore, the l butene polymer of this invention has an isotacticity value of at least 95 , preferably at least 95.5 , more preferably 95.5 to 99 , characteristic 3 . If the isotacticity value of the polymer is less than 95 , the polymer has inferior rigidity and an unsatisfactorily low crystal transition speed. Hence, the polymer should meet the above isotacticity value condition. The Rw gn is determined in the following manner. 1 Using standard polystyrene of a known molecular weight mono dispersed polystyrene, a product of Toyo Soda Mfg. Co., Ltd., Japan , the molecular weight M of the polystyrene sample and its GPC gel permeation chromatography count are measured. A calibration curve for the molecular weight M and the EV elution volume is drawn. 2 A gel permeation chromatogram of the sample is taken by the GPC measuring method, and the MiNi number average molecular weight Mn Ni and the weight average molecular weight Mw are MiNi calculated for polymer by 1 above, and the Mw Mn is determined. The sample is prepared under the following conditions, and the conditions for GPC are as shown below.Preparation of the sample a The polymer is taken into an Erlenmeyer flask together with o dichlorobenzene so as to provide 15 mg polymer 20 ml solvent solution. b Into the Erlenmeyer flask containing the sample is added 0.1 by weight, based on the polymer solution, of 2,6 di tert. butyl p cresol as an anti oxidant. c The erlenmeyer is maintained at 140 C for one hour and then the contents are stirred for about one hour to dissolve the polymer and the antioxidant. d Then, at 135 to 140 C, the solution is filtered by a Millipore filter of 0.5 u in an opening size. e The filtrate is subjected to gel permeation chromatography.Conditions for gel permeation chromatography a Device Model 150 C, made by Waters Company b Column TSK GMH 6 6mm x 600 mm made by Toyo Soda Mfg. Co., Ltd. c Amount of the sample 400 pQ d Temperature 13500 e Flow rate 1 ml min. The isotacticity value is triadtacticity determined from 13C NMR 500 MHz using the signal of carbon of the methine group of 1 butene. In the case of a copolymer of l butene with another olefin, the methine group of the l butene adjacent to the other olefin is excluded in determining its triadtacticity. The specific procedure of measuring the isotacticity value is as follows Preparation of a sample a The polymer is taken into an NMR measuring sample tube having a diameter of 10 mm together with hexachlorobutadiene as a solvent so as to provide a 200 mg polymer 1.5 ml solvent solution. b The sample tube is left to stand at 120 C for 12 hours, and then further maintained at about 2500C for 2 to 3 minutes to dissolve the polymer completely and uniformly. c The solution was further left to stand at 120 C for 1 to 2 hours. The measurement was made on the sample so prepared. Conditions for measurement a Device 500 MHZ FT NMR made by Nippon Denshi K.K. b Measuring temperature 1200C. The 1 butene polymer of the invention meets the combination of parameters 1 to 3 . To the best of the knowledges of the present inventors, no l butene polymer has been known which meets these parameters in combination. The 1 butene polymers previously used for providing shaped articles, particlulary pipe structures, have an intrinsic viscosity T of about 2.5 to about 4.8 dl g and a Rw ldn ratio of about 6 to about 12 and an isotacticity value of not more than 94. The l butene polymer of the invention can be shaped into pipe structures of the desired shape and size by utilizing melt shaping methods known per se.For example, the l butene polymer of the invention can be shaped, with or without additives of the types and amounts which do not substantially affect the excellent properties of the polymer, into pipe structures of the desired shape and size by a known melt shaping method, for example melt extrusion, and cooling the shaped article. Any suitable method can be selected for the above shaping and cooling. For example, a pipe structure may be produced by melting the polymer in an extruder, shaping it into a pipe by means of a straight head die, a crosshead die, an offset die, or the like, and cooling the pipe with cooling air, cooling water, etc. while restricting its outside diameter by a sizing plate method, an outside mandrel method, a sizing box method, a inside mandrel method, etc. The melt shaping conditions and cooling conditions can be suitably selected. For example, the metl shaping is carried out at a temperature of about 180 to 250 C under an extruding pressure of about 2 70 to about 130 kg cmÃª, and the cooling may be carried aout at a temperature of 0 to about 30 C. The additives which may be incorporated in the molding 1 butene polymers as required may be those additives which are normally used for polyolefins.They include, for example, weatherability stabilizers, heat stabilizers, lubricant and slip agents, antiblocking agents, nucleating agents, pigments and dyes, antihaze agents, HC1 absorbers and inorganic and organic fillers.

The amounts of these additives may be properly chosen so long as they do not substantially affect the excellent properties of the 1 butene polymer. For examples, the amounts may be about 0.05 to about 0.5 by weight for the weatherability stabilizers, to about 0.05 to about 0.5 by weight for the heat stabilizers, about 0.05 to about 2 by weight for the slip agents or lubricants, about 0.05 to about 1 by weight for the nucleaing agents, about 0.1 to about 2 by weight for the coloring agents, about 0.01 to about 0.5 by weight for the antiblocking agents, about 0.1 to about 2 by weight for the antihaze agents, about 0.1 to about 2 by weight for the antistatic agents, and about 0.1 to about 2 by weight for the fillers, all based on the weight of the 1 butene polymer. The 1 butene polymer of this invention suitable for production of shaped articles, particularly pipe structures can be produced by using a selected catalyst. For example, it can be prepared by polymerizing l butene or copolymerizing l butene with up to 1 mole of an olefin with 2 to 12 carbon atoms other than 1 butene in the presence of a catalyst composed of A a solid highly active titanium catalyst component, B a trialkyl aluminum compound and C at least one organosilicon compound selected from the group consisting of triethylmethoxysilane, triethylethoxysilane, tripropylmethoxysilane, methyltriethoxysilane, ethyltriethoxysilane, vinyltriethoxysilane, n propyltriethoxysilane, phenyltriethoxysilane and tetraethoxysilane. The solid highly active titanium catalyst component A that can be used in this invention contains magnesium, titanium, halogen and a diester of a dicarboxylic acid as essential components. The titanium catalyst component A desirably has a magnesium titanium atomic ratio of from about 2 to about 100, preferably from about 4 to about 70, a halogen titanium atomic ratio of from about 4 to about 100, preferably from about 6 to about 40, and a diester titanium mole ratio of from about 0.2 to about 10, preferably from about 0.4 to about 6. The specific surface area of the titanium catalyst component A is preferably at least about 3 m2 g, more preferably at least about 40 m2 g, especially preferably about lOO m2 g to about 800 m2 g. Usually, the titanium catalyst component A does not substantially liberate a titanium compound when treated by a simple means such as washing with hexane at room temperature. The X ray spectrum of the titanium catalyst component A shows that irrespective of the starting magnesium compound used for its preparation, it shows an amorphous nature with regard to the magnesium compound or it is much more amorphous than a usual commercially available magnesium dihalide. In addition to the aforesaid essential components, the titanium catalyst component A may further include other elements, metals, functional groups, electron donors, etc. to an extent that they do not adversly affect the performance of the catalyt.Or the component A may be diluted with an organic or inorganic diluent. The titanium catalyst component A may be prepared by contacting a magnesium compound or metallic magnesium , a titanium compound and a diester or a compound capable of forming a diester with one another with or without using another reagent in accordance with the same method of preparing known highly active titanium catalyst components, which are disclosed, for example, in British Patent Specifications Nos. 1492618, 1554340 and 1554248 and U. S. Patent Nos. 4157435, 4076924, 4085276, 4250285, 4232139, 4143223, 4315874, 4330649, 4401589 and 4335015 and European PatentSpecification No. 22675. Some examples of the procedure of producing the titanium catalyst component A are sumarized below. 1 A magnesium compound or a complex of a magnesium compound and an electron donor is pretreated or not pretreated with an electron donor and or a reaction aid such as an organoaluminum compound or a halogen containing silicon compound in the presence or absence of an electron donor or a pulverization aid with or without pulverization. The resulting solid is reacted with a titanium compound which is in the liquid state under the reaction conditions.In the above procedure, a diester of a dicarboxylic acid or a compound capable of forming the diester is used at least once as the electron donor. 2 A magnesium compound in the liquid state having no reducing ability is reacted with a titanium compound in the liquid state in the presence of a diester of a dicarboxylic acid or a compound capable of forming the diester to precipitate a solid titanium complex. 3 The product obtained in 2 above is further reacted with a titanium compound. 4 The product obtained in 1 or 2 is further reacted with a titanium compound and as an electron donor, a diester of a dicarboxylic acid or a compound capable of forming the ester. 5 A magnesium compound or a complex of a magnesium compound and an electron donor is pulverized in the presence of a titanium compound and in the presence or absence of an electron donor and a pulverization aid, and with or without pre treatment with an electron donor and or a reaction aid such as an organoaluminum compound or a halogen containing silicon compound, treated with a halogen, a halogen compound or an aromatic hydrocarbon. In the above procedure, a diester of a dicarboxylic acid or a compound capable of forming the diester is used at least once as the electron donor. Preferred among these methods are those in which a liquid titanium halide is used, or a halogenated hydrocarbon is used after or during the use of the titanium compound. The electron donor used in the above methods of preparation is not necessarily limited to the diester or diester forming compound. There may be used other electron donors such as alcohols, phenols, aldehydes, ketones, ethers, carboxylic acids, carboxylic acid anhydrides, carboxylic acid esters, monoesters and amines. It is essential however that the diester of a dicarboxylic acid or the diesterforming compound be used at least once. Preferred examples of the diester as an essential component of the solid highly active titanium catalyst component A used in this invention include diesters of dicarboxylic acids in which two carboxyl groups are attached to one carbon atom of the hydrocarbon moiety or dicarboxylic acids in which one carboxyl group is attached to each of the two adjoining carbon atoms of the hydrocarbon moiety, and diesters of dicarboxylic acids in which one carboxyl group is attached to each of the two adjoining carbon atoms of the heterocyclic compound moiety containing at least two carbon atoms. More specific examples of the preferred diesters are diesters, preferably di C1 C20 alkyl esters in which the two alkyl gorups may be identical or different, of dicarboxylic acids in which two carboxyl groups are attached to one carbon atom of an aliphatic hydrocarbon moiety having 1 to 20 carbon atoms or dicarboxylic acids in which one carboxyl group is attached to each of the two adjoining carbon atoms of an aliphatic hydrocarbon moiety having 2 to 20 carbon atoms diesters, preferably di C1 C20 alkyl esters in which the two alkyl esters may be identical or different, of dicarboxylic acids in which two carboxyl groups are attached to one carbon atom of an alicyclic hydrocarbon moiety having 3 to 20 carbon atoms or dicarboxylic acids in which one carboxyl group is attached to each of the two adjoining carbon atoms of the aforesaid alicyclic hydrocarbon moiety diesters, preferably di C1 C20 alkyl esters in which the two alkyl groups may be identical or different, of dicarboxylic acids in which one carboxyl group is attached to each of the adjoining carbon atoms at the ortho position of an aromatic hydrocarbon moiety having 6 to 20 carbon atoms and diesters, preferably di C1 C20 alkyl esters, of dicarboxylic acids in which one carboxyl group is attached to each of the two adjoining carbon atoms of a heterocyclic compound moiety containing at least two carbon atoms and 1 to 10 hetero atoms selected from the group consisting of 0,N and S atoms. Specific examples of the dicarboxylic acids exemplified above include malonic acid substituted malonic acids such as methylmalonic acid, ethylmalonic acid, isopropylmalonic acid, allylmalonic acid, and phenylmalonic acid succinic acid substituted succinic acids such as methylsuccinic acid, dimethylsuccinic acid, ethylsuccinic acid, methylethylsuccinic acid and itaconic acid maleic acid substituted maleic acids such as citraconic acid and dimethylmaleic acid fumaric acid substituted fumaric acid such as methylfumaric acid and ethylfumaric acid alicyclic dicarboxylic acids such as cyclopentane l,l dicarboxylic acid, cyclopentane 1,2 dicarboxylic acid, cyclohexane 1,2 dicarboxylic acid, cyclohexene 1,2 dicarboxylic acid, cyclohexene 2,3 dicarboxylic acid, cyclohexene 3,4dicarboxylic acid, cyclohexene 4,5 dicarboxylic acid, asdic Acid, Methylnadic Acid, and l allylcyclohexane3,4 dicarboxylic acid aromatic dicarboxylic acids such as phthalic acid, naphthalene 1,2 dicarboxylic acid and naphthalene 2,3 dicarboxylic acid and heterocyclic dicarboxylic acids such as furane 3,4dicarboxylic acid, 4,5 dihydrofurane 2,3, dicarboxylic acid, benzopyran 3,4 dicarboxylic acid, pyrrole 2,3dicarboxylic acid, pyridine 2,3 dicarboxylic acid, thiophene 3,4 dicarboxylic acid, and indole 2,3dicarboxylic acid. Preferably, at least one of the alcohol components of the dicarboxylic acid diesters exemplified above has at least 2 carbon atoms, for example 2 to 20 carbon atoms, especially at least 3 carbon atoms. It is above all preferred that both of the alcohol components have at least 2 carbon atoms, especially at least 3 carbon atoms.

In the preparation of the titanium catalyt component A , the amounts of the titanium compound, the magnesium compound the electron donor to be supported, and the other electron donors such as alcohols, p enols, onocarboxylic acid esters, the silicon com zoun arid the aluminum compound which may used as required differ depending upon the method of preparation and cannot be defined in a general manner.For example, about 0.1 to aobut 10 moles of the electron donor to be supported and about 0.05 mole to about 1000 moles of the titanium compound may be used per mole of the magnesium compound. The catalyst composed of A the titanium catalyst component that can be obtained as above, B a trialkyl aluminurn compound and C an organosilicon compound selected from the group stated hereinabove can be utilized in producing the l butene polymer in accordance with this invention. Examples of preferred trialkyl aluminum compounds B are triethyl aluminum and triisobutyl aluminum. The polymerization or copolymerization of 1butene can be carried out in the liquid phase. An inert solvent such as hexane, heptane and kerosene may be used as a reaction medium, but l butene itself may be used as a reaction solvent. The amount of the catalyst used is preferably such that per liter of the volume of the reaction zone, the compound A is used in an amount of about 0.0001 to about 1.0 millimole calculated as titanium atom the component B is used in such an amount that the proportion of the metal atom in component B is about 1 to about 2000 moles, preferably about 5 to about 500 moles, per mole of the titanium atom in the component A and the component C is used in such an amount that the proportion of the Si atom in component C is about 0.001 to about 10 moles, preferably about 0.01 to about 2 moles, especially preferably about 0.05 to about 1 mole, per mole of the metal atom in component B . The catlayst components A , B and C may be contacted during or before the polymerization. In contacting them before the polymerization, only two of them selected may be contacted, or portions of two or three of them may be contacted. The contacting of the components before the polymerization may be carried out in an inert gaseous atmosphere, or in an atmosphere of l butene. the polymeriazation temperature is preferably about 20 to about 200 C, more preferably about 50 to bout 180 C, and polymerization pressure is from atmospheric pressure to about 100 kg cmÃª, preferably about 2 to about 50 kg cmÃª. The intrinsic viscosity of the polymer can be controlled to some extent by changing the polymerization conditions such as the polymerization temperature and the proportions of the catalyst components. Most effectively, this can be achieved by adding hydrogen to the polymerization system. Pipes produced from the l butene polymer of this invention have improved rigidity, creep resistance characteristics and impact strength than conventional pipes of l butene resins. Furthermore, since the crystal transition speed of the l butene polymer of this invention is increased, shaped products immediately after shaping can be advantageously handled. The following examples illustrate the present invention more specifically.Example 1 Preparation of a titanium catalyst component A Anhydrous magnesium chloride 4.76 g 50 mmoles , 25 ml of decane and 23.4 ml 150 mmoles of 2 ehtylhexyl alcohol were heated at 130 C for 2 hours to form a uniform solution. To the solution was added 1.11 g 7.5 mmoles of phthalic anhydride, and the mixture was stirred at 1300C for 1 hour to dissolve phthalic anhydride in the uniform solution. The resulting uniform solution was cooled to room temperature, and added dropwise over the course of 1 hour to 200 ml 1.8 moles of titanium tetrachloride kept at 200C. After the addition, the temperature of the mixture was raised to 110 C over the course of 4 hours. When its temperature reached 1100C, 2.68 ml 12.5 mmoles of diisobutyl phthalate was added, and the mixture was maintained at this temperature for 2 hours with stirring.After the 2 hour reaction, the solid portion was collected by hot filtration. The solid poriton was again suspended in 200 ml of titanium tetrachloride, and again reacted at 110 0C for 2 hours. After the reaction, the solid portion was collected again by hot filtration, and washed with decane and hexane at 110 C until no free titanium compound was detected from the washings. The titanium catalyst component A prepared by the foregoing procedure was stored as a hexane slurry. A part of it, however, was dried for determining its composition. It was found that the titanium catalyst component A formed contained 3.1 by weight of titanium, 56.0 by weight of chlorine, 17.0 by weight of magnesium and 20.9 by weight of diisobutyl phthalate. Polymerization A 2 liter autoclave was cooled to below 500C, and 1 liter of liquid l butene, 1 mmole of triethyl alurninum, 0.05 mmole of vinyltriethoxysilane and 2 liters of hydrogen were introduced into the autoclave.The mixture was heated to 600C, and then 0.01 mmole, calculated as titanium atom, of the titanium catalyst component A was added. The l butene was polymerized at 600C for 1 hour. Then, methanol was added to step the polymerization, and the unreacted l butene was rernoved. The results of the polymerization are summarized in Table 1. An antioxidant was added to the resulting polymer, and the mixture was kneaded and granulated by a single screw extruder with a screw diameter of 30 mm at a resin temperature of 2300C, and press formed at 200C into a sheet having a thickness of 1 morn. The sheet was tested for the following properties. Tensile strss at yield point kg cmÃª Measured in accordance with ASTM D 638 using an ASTM No. 4 dumbbell specimen. Izod impact strength kg cm cm A notch was provided in the sample, and its impact strength was measured in accordance with ASTMD 256. Creep resistance hours Tensile creep was evaluated in accordance with ASTM D 2990. The sample was an ASTM No. 4 dumbbel specimen. The testing temperature was 100 C, and the load was 20 kg. The time which elapsed until the specimen was broken, or stretched 25 was measured. 50 Transition time hours By X ray diffraction, the ratio of the 110 plane reflection peak intensity of the I type crystals to the 200 plane reflection peak intensity of theII type crystals was measured. The time required until the intensity ratio reached one half of the saturated value of the intensity ratio with the lapse of time was measured.Example 2 Example 1 was repeated except that the amount of hydrogen used in the polymerization was changed to 1 liter.
