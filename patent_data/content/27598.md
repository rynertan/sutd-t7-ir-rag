# Power transmission and energy absorbing systems, and method of manufacture.

## Abstract
A power transmission energy absorption device and car bon composite friction facing material 14 for use therein having superior friction characteristics. Through appropriate selection of the starting carbon substrate material and through precise control over the amount and character of pyrolytic carbon, or graphite deposited interstitially of the substrate, the friction facing material can be optimized for a wide variety of applications. The material is particularly suited for use with cooling mediums, such as oil, and performs in an outstanding manner in heavy load, high temperature, hostile environments.
