# Method of assembling an electric motor.

## Abstract
A laminated core of a stator of a universal motor consists of two core parts 1, 2 , each of which bounds a part of a central opening 19 of the stator. The stator has at least one field winding 16,18 , and at least one longitudinal part of the field winding 16, 18 , running in the direction of the longitudinal axis 19 of the stator, is located in the region of the central opening 19 . The core parts 1, 2 are separated from one another at junction planes 9, 10 which run substantially parallel to the plane in which the two longitu dinal parts of the field winding 16, 18 are located. The two core parts 1, 2 of the stator, the field winding or windings 16, 18 , and the armature 19 are all assembled by relative movement along a single direction, thus facilitating automa tion of this assembly.
