# A motor pump unit for a high pressure cleaning unit.

## Abstract
A motor pump unit for a high pressure cleaning unit with the motor 2 and the pump 3 placed in line with one another inside a common housing 1 . The housing 1 is designed with a double wall 10, 11 extending, at least, along the longitudinal section of the housing in which the pump 2 and the motor 3 are placed. The hollow space 12 in the double wall 10, 11 delimits a flow channel for the relatively cold pressure liquid supplied from the pump. In the hollow space in the double wall there is moreover placed a helical coil 15 . By means of the double wall, effi cient cooling of the motor pump unit is obtained without the use of flow channels incorporated in cast motor housings.

## Description
The invention relates to a motor pump unit for a high pressure cleaning unit, in which the motor and pump are placed in line with one another inside a common housing.It has long been known to provide the necessary cooling of the motor and pump by incorporating flow channels for the relatively cold cleaning liquid in the motor housing. However, it has turned out that the cleaning liquid which is later ejected through a spray gun often contains aggressive components resulting in corrosion of the channels in the motor housing, which channels, for reasons of casting technique, are made from metals or alloys with a relatively low resistance to said aggressive media. Furthermore, a complex production technique is required for providing flow channels inside the motor housing.It has been endeavoured to eliminate the disadvantages as regards the corrosion arising from the aggressive components of the cleaning liquid, by lining the channels in the motor housing with stainless steel or another resistant maternal.Naturally, this has made production even more complex and thus uneconomic.In Danish patent application No. 1705 82 a motor pump unit is disclosed in which the conventional jacket cooling is combined with air cooling provided by means of an impeller placed at the end of the motor, which impeller is driven together with the motor. The impeller is dimensioned in such a way that in the periods when the pump ejects liquid through the spray gun, it will contribute considerably to the cooling of both motor and pump, and in the periods when the pump does not eject liquid, or when there are defects in the liquid circulation, it will develop a cooling effect which is sufficient for keeping motor and pump below critical temperatures, as these units do not emit so much heat when the ejection of the cleaning liquid has stopped. However, the motor pump unit disclosed in Danish patent application No. 1705 82 is also fairly complex because of the flow channels incorporated in the motor housing, which is lined with a material resistant to one of the above mentioned aggressive components in the cleaning liquid, and the provision of an impeller at the end of the pump increases the length of the motor pump unit and thus increases the cost additionally.The object of the invention is to improve the known jacket cooling so that the jacket cooling alone will provide reliable and sufficient cooling of the heat emitting components placed inside the housing, such as pump and motor.According to the invention, this object is attained by the motor pump unit of the type mentioned in the opening paragraph and characterized in that the housing is designed with a double wall extending, at least, along the longitudinal section of the housing where the pump and motor are placed, and that the hollow space in the double wall delimits a flow channel for the relatively cold pressure liquid supplied from the pump.By designing the wall of the housing as a double wall there is, for one thing, a possibility of a very simple production process, as the housing e.g. may be shaped by placing substantially circular cylindrical sheet metal shells at a distance from one another, and thus there is no need to incorporate channels in a motor housing. By extending the double wall along the pump and motor at least, cooling of all heat emitting units is provided at the same time.In a possible embodiment of a motor pump unit according to the invention, a helical coil dividing the hollow space into a thread extending in the longitudinal direction of the housing is placed between the outer and inner wall.For one thing, this makes it possible to use very thin sheets, as the helical coil inside the hollow space will provide the required mechanical strength in combination with the two sheets, and it is ensured that the heat emitting area is swept by the pressure liquid conveyed through the hollow space by the pump, so that the efficiency of the cooling is enhanced.In an embodiment preferred in practice, the walls will be made of stainless steel plates.By this means, high resistance to aggressive media is obtained without complicating the production process for the housing.The invention will be described in more detail below, with reference to the drawing, which consists of one figure showing a schematic longitudinal sectional view of a motor pump unit designed in accordance with the invention. Cn the drawing, the motor pump unit as a whole is designated by the reference number 1. The unit consists of a motor unit 2 known p e r s e and a pump unit 3, which is a conventional axial piston pump in the embodiment shown. The motor 2 and the pump 3 are separated by a dividing plate 4, which is also designed to carry the bearings 5 of the axial pump and the bearings 6 of the motor. The motor 2 and the axial pump 3 are built together, in a known manner, by means of the shaft end protruding from the motor 7. In the embodiment shown on the drawing, the motor 2 and the pump 3 are incorporated in a substantially circular cylindrical housing 8 and shut off, in a known manner, a main chamber 9 around the pistons of the axial pump. The wall of the housing 8 is designed as a double wall, where the inner and outer wall are designated 11 and 10, respectively. Between the two walls there is an annular hollow space 12, through which the pressure liquid supplied by the pump can be caused to flow, as two apertures are provided at the ends of the annular hollow space 12 in the longitudinal direction of the housing viz. one admission aperture 13 and one discharge aperture 14In the embodiment shown in the drawing there is a helical thread in the hollow space 12, as a substantially vertical parting face 15, extending along a helical line, is placed between the two walls 10 and 11.
