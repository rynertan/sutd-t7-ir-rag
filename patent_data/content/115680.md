# Improvements in catalyst production.

## Abstract
Catalysts of the ZSM 5 synthetic zeolite type can be prepared by heating a mixture of a precursor for an alumina hydrate, a precursor for silica hydrogel, an alkali metal hydroxide and water together with an organic templating agent selected from the group of carboxymethylcellulose, the condensation product of an alkanolamine and a fatty acid and cellulose hydroxyethyl ether and thereafter heat ing the reaction product under autogenous conditions. Un like prior proposals ZSM 5 which is uncontaminated by other zeolites, is prepared in high yield.
