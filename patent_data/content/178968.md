## Description
The present invention is directed to bipolar transistor logic gates, having both multiple inputs and multiple outputs and more particularly to gates of this type that combine high speed operation with high packing density. Logic gates that are constructed utilizing Schottky transistor logic STL are noted for their high switching speeds, and find utility in a number of applications because of this characteristic. Basically, an STL gate comprises a Schottky transistor, i.e., a bipolar transistor with a Schottky diode clamp between its base and collector. The cathodes of a plurality of Schottky diodes are each connected to the collector of the Schottky transistor, and their anodes comprise the output terminals for the gate. In operation, the clamp between the base and collector of the Schottky transistor prevents this transistor from going into saturation. Consequently, the transistor is quick to respond to changes in the voltage levels at its base. Further information regarding the features and operating characteristics of an STL gate can be found in the article STL Technology by Ben J. Sloan, While STL gates are desirable from the standpoint of their high switching speed, one drawback that has heretofore been associated with them is the comparatively large area that is required for each gate, resulting in a low packing density on a chip. More particularly, in a conventional STL gate, each of the output Schottky diodes is formed on a separate island on the chip, which increases the area of the buried layer for the chip and adds to the isolation area on the chip. The higher the fan out for each gate, the greater the number of islands that must be provided per gate. For example, a conventional STL gate having a fan out of of four requires five islands, one for each of the four Schottky diodes and one for the transistor collector. The need to provide each of these separate areas on the chip limits the packing density that can be obtained. Documents DE A 2 624 339, US A 4 214 315, and GB A 2 056 767 each disclose a monolithic transistor logic circuit in which an emitter and a base region are formed on a substrate and a plurality of Schottky diodes are formed on the base layer to provide plural input terminals for the logic circuit. Document EP A 0 048 849 discloses Schottky diodes comprising a rare earth metal silicide deposited on a p type base layer, such diodes being suited to be used in STL logic gates. It is the object of the present invention to provide a monolithic transistor logic circuit which permits an improved packing density, i.e. in which the available surface is more economically used, without interfering with the requirement of high switching capability. This problem is solved, according to the present invention, by the features set forth in independent claim 1 the dependent claims relate to preferred embodiments of the claim 1 concept. Hereinafter, the invention will be described in more detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. Figure 1 is a schematic circuit diagram of a base coupled transistor logic gate embodying the present invention Figure 2 is a schematic circuit diagram of an alternate embodiment of a logic gate that employs the principles of the present invention Figures 3a 3d are cross sectional views of a monolithic circuit during various steps in the fabrication of a logic gate. Figure 4 is a schematic circuit diagram of an integrated injection logic I²L gate which employs the present invention and Figure 5 is a cross sectional view of a monolithic I²L gate constructed in accordance with the present invention. Referring to Figure 1, a base coupled logic gate comprises a bipolar transistor 10 whose collector forms the output terminal of the gate and whose emitter is grounded. A current source V The gate represented in Figure 1 is a wired NAND gate. In operation, when the input signal at each of the four input terminals is at a high voltage level, the Schottky diodes 16 are reverse biased and the current from the source V When the signal at any one or more of the input Schottky diodes goes low, a current sink is formed and the current from the source V A variation of this logic gate is illustrated in Figure 2. In this embodiment, there is no Schottky diode 14 that forms a clamp between the base and collector of the transistor. Rather, the transistor is provided with a second emitter 18, which is tied back to the base of the transistor. This emitter feedback operates in a fashion analogous to the clamp, to limit the base voltage of the transistor and thereby prevent it from going into deep saturation. In accordance with the present invention, considerable savings in the required area for each gate is achieved by forming the input Schottky diodes directly on the base region for the switching transistor 10 of the gate. More particularly, using presently available technology, the Schottky diodes 16 are formed by depositing a Schottky type metal, or more preferably a rare earth silicide, directly onto the p type material that comprises the base of the transistor, to form the Schottky barrier. The majority carries in a diode of this type comprise the holes which are emitted by the p type base material and move to the metal or silicide coating when the base material is more positively biased than the coating. Various steps in the fabrication of a logic gate are depicted in the cross sectional illustrations of Figures 3a 3c. Using known techniques, a semiconductor wafer is processed in a conventional manner to produce the structure illustrated in Figure 3a. This structure comprises a p type substrate 20 having an n type epitaxial layer 22 grown thereon. An n Referring to Figure 3b, the epitaxial layer is lightly doped with boron, or a similar such dopant having p type conductivity, to form the intrinsic base region 30 of the transistor. By lightly doped is meant that the concentration of acceptor atoms in the base region is in the order of magnitude of 10¹⁵ 10¹⁷ atoms cm opposed to the usual concentration of 10¹⁹ 10²⁰ atoms cm Referring now to Figure 3c, boron is optionally implanted through the oxide while the active device regions are covered to reduce the series resistance of the p type base region. Of course, the resistance can be reduced through other techniques, e.g., appropriate circuit design, to forego with the need for the second implantation of the acceptor material. If this implantation is carried out, it is preferably done using a critical mask, i.e., one having an alignment tolerance of about 0.5 . Following this implantation, one of the nitride sections is removed, for example by etching, and arsenic, or other suitable n type dopant, is implanted in this area to form the emitter region 34. The emitter implant is annealed and the remaining nitride on the wafer is removed. A silicide is deposited in those areas from which the nitride has been removed, to form the Schottky barriers for the input diodes 16. Preferably, a rare earth silicide is used to form the Schottky barrier on the p type material, as disclosed in the article The Schottky Barrier Height of the Contacts Between Some Rare Earth Metals and Silicides and p type Silicon by H. Norde et al, Appl. Phys. Lett. 38 11 , 1 June 1981, pp. 865 867. A hole is made in the oxide layer 32 and a base contact is deposited thereon, to enable the current source V As an alternative to the implantation of arsenic, the emitter of the bipolar transistor can be formed by diffusing arsenic or any other n type dopant from a layer of polysilicon which has previously been doped with the dopant. After the growth of oxide in regions isolated by the layer of nitride on the epitaxial layer, as shown in Fig. 3b, and removal of the nitride layer from above the emitter, a layer 36 of polysilicon, around .2 to .5 microns thick, is deposited over the whole wafer. Next, it is implanted with arsenic or any other n type dopant to a dose of approximately 1 x 10¹⁵ to 1 x 10¹⁶ atoms cm ². The polysilicon is etched, using photoresist as a mask, from all the areas except above the emitter. A thin oxide is grown on the polysilicon emitter next, and the emitter is formed by diffusion of the n type impurity from the polysilicon bar. The resulting structure is shown in Fig. 3d. The remaining process steps follow the description stated previously with respect to Figure 3c. From the foregoing, it can be seen that all of the Schottky diodes are formed on the base island for the transistor, which provides a tremendous savings in area over prior techniques and thus leads to higher packing densities. It is estimated that packing density can be increased by up to 100 with this technique. Furthermore, this logic reduces the buried layer capacitance of the gate, thus contributing to its high speed operation. This technique is not limited to gates which employ Schottky transistors. More particularly, in accordance with the invention it is applicable to transistors that act in an upward mode, such as an I²L transistor. The schematic circuit diagram for such a gate is illustrated in Figure 4. Like the STL gate, the I²L gate includes a switching transistor 40 whose emitter is grounded and whose collector forms the output terminal of the gate. In this case, however, the translator has multiple collectors, each of which comprises an output terminal. The input signals to the gate are fed to the transistor through Schottky diodes 42. The current for driving the switching transistor 40 is supplied to the base of the transistor through an injection transistor 44. Whereas the switching transistor 40 is an NPN type transistor, the injection transistor 44 is of a complementary type, i.e., PNP. Its collector is connected to the base of the switching transistor 40 and its base is tied to the emitter of the switching transistor 40, i.e., it is grounded. The emitter of the injection transistor 44 is connected to the current source V An implementation of the principles of the present Invention in an I²L gate is illustrated in a cross sectional form in Figure 5. As is conventional, the emitter of the switching transistor 40 and the base of the injection transistor 44 are embodied in an n As in the previously described embodiment, the input terminals for the gate are comprised of Schottky diodes that are formed directly on the base region, rather than being isolated therefrom on separate islands. This formation of the input terminals on the p type base region allows them to be isolated and results in a true multiple input multiple output gate. Basically, this gate can be fabricating using conventional I³L isolated integrated injection logic processes. However, in accordance with the present invention, the surface dopant concentration in the base region is lower than is conventional, so that the Schottky diodes can be reliably formed therein. From the foregoing, it will be appreciated that the present invention provides an integrated logic gate configuration that does not require a compromise between the highly desirable objectives of high switching speed and high packing density. Rather, it enables both to be achieved in a single gate. Furthermore, with respect to integrated injection logic, it provides a more versatile gate having both multiple inputs and multiple outputs.
