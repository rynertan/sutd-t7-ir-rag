## Description
Optically active a azido p hydroxyphenylacetic acid and its salts, and the preparation thereof This invention relates to optically active a azido p hydroxyphenyl acetic acid and salts thereof, and more particularly D a azido phydroxyphenylacetic acid and salts thereof. The invention also relates to a process for the preparation of these compounds. The said compounds are novel and are particularly suitable as starting product for the preparation of a amino p hydroxybenzyl penicillins and cephalosporins, more particularly for the preparation of 6 a amino p hydroxybenzyl amino 6 methoxy penicillins. These products were hitherto produced by means of D a amino p hydroxyphenylacetic acid.The use of this known starting product, however, has the disadvantage that the amino group, before the formation of the 6 methoxy penicillin, must be protected very carefully and under critical conditions by means of a group which after the penicillin preparation has to be removed under equally dificult and very critical conditions. By products may be formed particularly during the removal of the protective group, so that the yield of the known preparation process is unattractively low.Direct coupling with the 6 methcxy penicillin fraction is possible when using optically active a azido p hydroxyphenylacetic acid, and after this it is only necessary to convert thea azido group into the required amino function. This conversion can easily be carried out by means of a catalytic reduction with hydrogen. Critical conditions, the use of protective groups and by product formation do not occur, so that high yields are obtained. a Azido p hydroxyphenylacetic acid can also be used in the preparation of the more conventional a amino p hydroxybenzyl penicillins and cephalosporins. This process is of comparable value to the syntheses hitherto used. However producti on via a azido p hydroxyphenylacetic acid is more attractive from the aspect of waste production. The protective groups used in the known syntheses are ultimately liberated as waste products. The route via a azido p hydroxyphenylacetic acid results only in nitrogen as a waste product in the conversion to the corresponding amino compounds. The novel optically active a azido p hydroxyphenylacetic acids can be prepared from the acetic form or directly from the raw materials of the racemic form. If is started from the racemic form, this can be done by dissolving DL a azido p hydroxyphenylacetic acid in a suitable solvent, such as an alcohol, ketone or ester whether or not mixed with water. One of the optical isomers can be crystallized out as a salt with the amine by the addition of an optically active organic base such as cinchonidine, ephedrine, cinchonine, brucine or morphine. The diastereomeric salt of D a azido p hydroxyphenylacetic acid and cinchonidine or ephedrine can be crystallized out of a solution of the racemate with a surprisingly favourable yield. The corresponding salt of L a azido p hydroxyphenylacetic acid can be crystallized out with a very favourable yield by means of brucine. The optically active acids can be obtained in a conventional manner from the diastereomeric salts formed by conversion with a strong acid or a strong base which if required can be used in the form of an ion exchanger. The DL azido p hydroxyphenylacetic acid used for the preparation of the novel optically active compounds can be obtained in a manner known per se for the preparation of azides by replacing the halogen atom in a corresponding halogen compound by an azido group.This reaction, however, has an unattractively low yield if used for the preparation of DL a azido p hydroxyphenylacetic acid. This azido compound can be obtained with a high yield by the reaction of a hydroxy p hydroxyphenylacetic acid with an azide, such as sodium azide, in an acid medium, e.g.aqueous sulphuric acid, hydrochloric acid or hydrobromic acid. It is notpossible to obtain a azido p hydroxyphenylacetic acid in an alkalin medium,while the yield is low in a neutral medium. The best result is obtained in the presence of hydrochloric acid or hydrobromic acid. This process is additionally attractive because the starting material, which is also known as p hydroxymandelic acid, is available on the market at a cheap price in large quantities or, if required, can easily be produced by condensation of phenol and glyoxylic acid.In the latter case it is also possible to dispense with the winning of p hydroxymandeli acid. After the condensation of phenol with glyoxylic acid in an aqueous alkaline medium acidification can be carried out to the required degree of acidity and the reaction with sodium azide can be carried out. An attractive process for the preparation of an optically active form of a azido p hydroxyphenylacetic acid also comprises dispensing wit winning the racemic form. To this end, after the reaction of phydroxymandelic acid with sodium azide, the reaction mixture is extracted with a water immiscible solvent, such as an ester, and one of the above mentioned optically active amines is added to the extract. After crystallization, the optically active form of a azido p hydroxyphenylacetic acid is obtained as a salt with the amine and is then processed in known manner.Example 1 Preparation of DL a azido p hydroxyphenylacetic acid with three different methods a A mixture of 93 g 0.5 mol of monohydrate of p hydroxymandelic acid and 39 g 0.6 mol of sodium azide were stirred in 700 ml of water at a temperature of 800C for 3 hours.
