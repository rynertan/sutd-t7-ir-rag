# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR IMPROVED INSPECTION OF CONTINUOUS WEBS

## Abstract
An improved method and apparatus is disclosed for the inspection of continuous running webs such as those used in the printing trade. A rotating drum of mirrors, having a polygonal cross section, allows inspection of a repeating image on the web, such that the repeating image on the moving web appears stationary to the viewer. The target portion of the web is oriented with respect to the rotating drum so that a straight line bisecting the target portion of the web passes through a locus of points having as its center the point halfway between the center of the drum and the viewing point on the drum. The sweeping scanning angle continually maintains correspondence to one repeat length of the web.
