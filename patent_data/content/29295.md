## Description
METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR WRAPPING CIGARS Disclosure The present invention relates to the art of making cigars and more particularly to a method and apparatus for wrapping cigars. The invention is particularly applicable to wrapping simultaneously two cigars with natural tobacco leaf wrappers and it will be described with particular reference thereto however, it is appreciated that the invention has broader applications and may be used in wrapping a single wrapper around a cigar. Also, synthetic wrappers can be used with the present invention. Two wrappers may be integrally formed however, this does not depart from the intended definition of a wrapper which is the outer covering for a single cigar. In some instances two wrappers are used simultaneously. They may be formed integrally or they may be separate and held in a given mutual relationship.The term sheet when used to define the wrappers relates to their geometry and applies equally to natural and synthetic wrappers. Background of Invention In making cigars, a generally cylindrical body, known as a bunch1 is spirally wrapped with a wrapper which has the appearance of a natural tobacco leaf. This wrapper can be formed from a natural tobacco leaf or from synthetic material having a similar appearance. These wrappers generally include a first end, known as the tuck or tuck end, that is adjacent the fire end of a completed cigar and a second end, known as a flag or flag end, which is ultimately wrapped at the mouth end of a completed cigar. In some instances, the bunch has an outer covering which supports the inner filler forming the insides of the cigar. The wrapper is a decorative cover element which is placed around the bunch in a spiral fashion to present the cigar appearance identified by consumers.In recent years, a substantial amount of effort and money have been devoted to automating the production of cigars. To this end, machines are now being developed which will automatically wrap a cigar wrapper around a cigar body, or bunch, without manual intervention, except for loading the bunches and cigar wrappers onto the machine. The cigar wrappers are often carried in a bobbin of web material formed from a porous fabric like sheet material. Storage of wrappers in the convolutions of a bobbin maintains the moisture of the cigar wrapper, especially when formed from natural tobacco leaves. These bobbins allow automatic feeding of wrappers to a machine for wrapping the wrappers around the cigar bunches.When storing cigar wrappers1 especially of the natural tobacco leaf variety, in bobbins, they have a relatively close spacing with respect to each other so that a substantial number of wrappers can be carried conveniently in a bobbin of manageable size. An objective of designing and manufacturing an automatic machine for wrapping cigars is to provide an arrangement for removing wrappers from the standard wrapper storage bobbins and for moving the wrappers to a position where they engage a cigar bunch and are wrapped around the bunch mechanically. One machine for accomplishing this operation is illustrated in UnitedStates Letters Patent 4,103,692. This prior patent is incorporated by reference herein for background information to show details of an automatic cigar wrapping machine of the general type employed in the preferred embodiment of the present invention. This prior patent illustrates an arrangement for automatically wrapping cigar wrappers from a supply bobbin onto cigar bunches. In this patent, the tuck end is secured to one end of the cigar and the cigar is rotated as it translates.The flag end of the wrapper trails the tuck end and is ultimately pulled around the mouth end of the cigar bunch where it is formed and knurled to produce the mouth end of a cigar. Another arrange ment for wrapping cigars is shown in Belgium Patent 872,750 issued June 14, 1979, wherein cigar bunches are moved by a conveyor in a straight line direction as a wrapper which has been picked from the bobbin and brought to a moving bunch. The wrapper is secured to one end of the bunch and as the rotating bunch moves in a straight line, the wrapper carrier moves over the bunch to deposit the wrapper onto the bunch. Again, this patent illustrates the concept of picking or removing a wrapper from a supply bobbin and winding it around a cigar bunch. In each of the two previous instances, the bunch is rotated as it is translated.In a like manner, the support structure for the wrapper is moved in the same direction as the support structure for the bunch during the wrapping operation so that the wrapper can be held by vacuum in a preselected position until it is pulled from the vacuum support element onto the rotating bunch to produce a desired wrapping operation. These two machines for automatically wrapping a cigar wrapper from a bobbin onto a moving, rotating cigar bunch forms the basic background of the present invention although the Belgium patent is not prior art.They both have one distinct disadvantage. When providing cigar wrappers on a bobbin of the type generally used for natural tobacco leaf wrappers1 the wrappers are positioned in parallel at generally the wrapping angle and have a spacing therebetween which is relatively small. Indeed, the tuck end of one wrapper overlaps, in a longitudinal direction, the flag end of another wrapper. The spacing has not been heretofore conducive to an automatic wrapping operation therefore, as shown in the Belgium patent, it has been necessary to provide an arrangement for spacing the wrappers a distance greater than the spacing on the bobbin before they are brought into contact with the rotating bunches. In the Belgium patent, a conveyor picks up a wrapper and then conveys it at the desired spacing to the winding area of the machine.In the prior United States patent 4,103,692, a desired spacing is accomplished by removing alternate wrappers at spaced wrapping stations. Both of these arrangements for respacing the wrappers are complicated and not desirable for economic automatic wrapping machines. To avoid the use of two or more separate wrapping stations, as shown in the prior United States patent, a respacing mechanism is illustrated in pending United States patent applicationSerial No. 973,037 filed December 26, 1978. In this prior application, the cigar wrappers on the bobbin are removed by vacuum elements which are close together when removing the wrapper from the web forming the bobbin and are spaced apart in the area in which wrapping actually occurs. This respacing which changes the spacing of the cigar wrappers from the spacing on the storage bobbin to the spacing necessary for wrapping has been an expensive and difficult task in automating cigar wrapping machines. United States Letters Patent 3,794,048 illustrates a wrapping operation wherein synthetic wrapper leaves are used. In this instance, it is also necessary to provide an appropriate spacing between adjacent wrappers which are directed toward the cigar body to be wrapped. Consequently, even when the wrappers are not provided from previously prepared wrapper storage bobbins, adjacent wrappers have been spaced from each other so that they do not overlap in the direction of movement toward the wrapping operation.This requires a rapidly moving conveyor for the wrappers during wrapping. A non automatic cigar wrapping device is shown in United States Letters Patent No. 3,111,950 wherein a rotating bunch moves over a wrapper that is wrapped in two directions on a single bunch. The Invention The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for wrapping cigar wrappers onto cigar bunches, which method and apparatus does not require respacing when the wrappers are supplied by standard wrapper bobbins, such as used in storing wrappers formed from natural tobacco leaves, or an arrangement for spacing adjacent wrappers when synthetic wrapper leaves are provided from a spool of synthetic material cut into wrappers prior to being directed to a wrapping mechanism.Consequently, although the invention is particularly adapted for use with the closely spaced cigar wrappers on a storage bobbin, it is also advantageous for use with equipment using wrappers cut from synthetic material. In both of these instances, prior wrapping apparatus have required sufficient spacing between the adjacent or successive wrappers as they are directed to the wrapping position of an automatic cigar wrapping machine. This is required because of the necessary spacing between bunches when they are individually rotated. In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a method of wrapping an elongated, flat sheet cigar wrapper having a first end, a second end, and an elongated axis extending between the ends around a generally cylindrical cigar body having a central axis and first and second axially spaced portions between which the wrapper is spirally wound at a selected wrapping angle as the cigar body moves along a wrapping path or working path generally perpendicular to the axis of the cigar body or bunch. In accordance with this method, the second end of the wrapper is secured to the first portion of the body at a first wrapping position where the wrapper and bunch are brought together.The first end of the wrapper extends toward the wrapping direction and the wrapper axis is generally at the wrapping angle. As the body is moved in the wrapping direction it is rotated about its axis with respect to the wrapper which has been secured onto the body. In this manner, the rotating bunch rolls over the wrapper in the wrapping direction to spirally wind the wrapper around the body until it is completely wrapped in place.This wrapping action is the reverse of prior wrapping actions in that the wrapper traveling along the wrapping path moves at a translation speed less than the translation speed of the rotating cigar body. This wrapping concept moves the cigar body away from the succeeding wrapper so that there is no interference with the succeeding wrapper, even though the two wrappers are spaced from each other a relatively short distance.Preferably this short distance is the spacing normally found when natural tobacco leaf wrappers are stored on the web of a wrapper bobbin. Thus, the spacing between adjacent wrappers can be relatively small whereas in the past, the spacing of adjacent wrappers had to be sufficiently large so that the total wrapping action could take place without the cigar body engaging the tuck area of the succeeding wrapper, which area includes a spot of glue for initiating the wrapping operation.The necessary spacing of bunch nests also requires substantial wrapper spacing. In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, there is provided an improved apparatus for wrapping a cigar wrapper, of the type defined above, around a cigar body. The improvement is provision of means for securing the trailing end of the wrapper to the cigar body at the initial wrapping station or position in the wrapping path and means for rotating the body about its axis with respect to the wrapper as the body is moving along the wrapping path so that the rotating body pulls the wrapper into a spiral pattern around the body. In this manner, the cigar body or bunch moves away from the next succeeding wrapper so that there is no interference with the glued tuck portion of the next wrapper which moves with the wrapper being wrapped. In accordance with still a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of conveying cigar wrappers of a given length to the wrapping position of an automatic machine for wrapping the wrappers in spiral patterns and at given angles about cigar bunches. The wrappers are conveyed from a storage bobbin formed from a porous web wherein successive wrappers are in parallel and are spaced in the longitudinal direction of the web a distance which is substantially less than the product of the sine of the given angle and the given length of the wrappers. This method comprises the steps of transferring the wrappers in succession from the bobbin web onto a wrapper conveyor while maintaining the spacing distance and then conveying the wrappers tQ the trapping position of the automatic wrapping maine while maintaining this same spacing distance between wrap so By using this method, the cigar wrapper are not reapaced from the time they leave the bobbin to tte time. they meet a generally cylindrical cigar bunch at the wrapping position preparatory to wrapping around a bunch. The primary object to the present invention is the provision of a method and apparatus for automatically wrapping cigar wrappers spirally around cigar bunches, which method and apparatus translate the bunches faster than the wrapped and result in reduced complexity and cost of the equipment. Still a further object of the present invention is the provision of a method and apparatus, as defined above, which method and apparatus incorporate a new wrapping concept for automatic wrapping machines wherein cigar bunches are wrapped toward the elongated wrappers to prevent interference between successive bunches and or wrappers. Still a further object of the present invention is the provision of a method and apparatus, as defined above, which method and apparatus can accept wrappers which are in a parallel pattern and closely spaced, even when the parallel pattern is angular and when adjacent wrappers are coextensive in a longitudinal direction and closely spaced. Still a further object of the present invention is the provision of a method and apparatus, as defined above, which method and apparatus can accommodate closely spaced wrappers of the type provided on storage bobbins formed from convolutions of porous fibrous web material without respacing the wrappers between movement of the wrappers from the bobbins to the wrapping position. These and other objects and advantages will become apparent from the following description taken together with the accompanying drawings.

Description of Prior Wrapping Concept Referring now to FIGURES 1, 1A and 1B, a prior concept for wrapping cigar wrappers about a cigar bunch, or body, is schematically illustrated in connection with a machine of the general type utilized in the preferred embodiment of the present invention. Two cigar wrappers W1, W2 are formed into a chevron shaped. compound wrapperW. Of course, the two individual wrappers Wi, W2 could be integrally formed into the chevron shaped wrapper W. In the illustrated embodiment, natural tobacco leaves are used to form the two wrappers Wi, W2.Each wrapper has a first end 10, a second end 12 and a longitudinal axis extending between the ends and generally parallel to edge 14 of the individual wrappers.In accordance with standard practice, end 10 is a flag or flag end, which is used to form the mouth end of a cigar. End 12 is a tuck or tuck end appearing at the fire end of a completed cigar. Tuck ends 12 are abutting to form cbevron wrapper W, which presents wrappers Wi, W2 at an angle determined generally by the angle of the abutting tuck ends. This angle is the wrapping angle for the cigar as the compound wrapper W is spirally wound around a cigar body or bunch B. As is well known, these bunches are formed in various machines and they generally include tobacco filler held together by an outer sealing sheet.Bunches B are generally cylindrical and include contoured ends 20, 22 having a central portion 24 adapted to be contacted by tuck ends 12 of wrappers WI1 2. A central axis x extends between ends 20, 22. In the illustrated embodiment, individual wrappers W1, W2 are wrapped from central portion 24 toward outer ends 20, 22 to form a dual cigar C, which is subsequently slit at center portion 24 to form two cigars C1, C2, as shown in FIGURE 6, each of which has a fire end and a mouth end. In accordance with the illustration in FIGURE 1, there is provided means for moving bunches B in a path, illustrated as circular path m, which path extends in a direction transverse to axes x of the respective bunches B.Path m, in the illustrated embodiment, is concentric with axis y so that compound wrappers W are wrapped around bunches B to form the dual cigars C having spaced mouth ends 30, 32. These mouth ends are covered with the flag ends of the wrappers during the wrapping operation in accordance with standard practice as described in prior UnitedStates Letters Patent 4,103,692. Wrappers W are carried to the wrapping position of path m by a continuously moving conveyor belt 40 entrained around spaced rollers 42, 44, which rollers have rotational axes generally parallel to axis y. Belt 40 includes a catenary portion 46, which is formed by maintaining a fixed length of the belt between rollers 42, 44.Catenary portion 46 defines an arc having a center generally concentric with axis y and defining a generally uniformly spaced wrapping gap G through which bunches B move in the path m between an initial wrapper contact position and a position where the wrapping process has been ccrmpleted. This can occur at various positions in gap G according to the length of the cigar being wrapped and the wrapping angle of the individual wrappers Wi, W2 with respect to bunches B and the longitudinal axis of belt 40. In accordance with the prior art wrapping concept, an adhesive is generally applied adjacent a portion of tuck end 12 facing away from belt 40. Bunches B are moved along path m at a velocity Vi and wrappersW are moved by belt 40 at a velocity V2. The relative movement between the bunches and wrappers is such that at the end of gap G adjacent roller 42, the entrant end of the gap, bunch B coincides with.tuck ends 12 of a wrapper W. In the preferred embodiment an appropriate arrangement is provided in roller 42 for pushing or lifting tuck ends 12 of wrappers W, W2 upwardly into tight adhesive relationship with central portion 24 of bunch B at the entrant end of gap G.Thereafter, as the bunch and secured wrapper W move through gap G, a drive means independently rotates the bunch and secured wrapper in the direction of the arrow surrounding the bunches in gap G. In this manner, wrappers WI, W2 are spirally wound about the bunch to which they are secured by the adhesive applied to tuck ends 12. Wrapping continues until flag ends 10 are adjacent to the ends 20, 22 of bunches B. At this time, the flags are wrapped into a final configuration at mouth ends 30, 32, as schematically illustrated in FIGURE 1. As can be seen, during the wrapping operation the wrappers are held fixedly onto belt 40 by vacuum until they are progressively peeled from the belt by the wrapping action of a rotating bunch. The bunch translates at a velocity V1 which is less than the translation velocity V2 of the wrappers.This allows the wrapper being peeled from belt 40 to catch up with bunches B when flag end 10 of each of the wrappers is pulled from its vacuum secured position on belt 40. At that time, flag 10 is wrapped around mouth ends 30, 32 to form the dual cigar C which is cut in the middle to produce two cigars C1, C2 having fire ends defined by the central portion 24 of bunch B and mouth ends 30, 32. Since wrappers W are held fixedly onto belt 40, the independently rotated bunchesB can rotate at a slightly higher surface or wrapping speed than necessary for wrapping so that a tension is applied to wrapper W as it is pulled from the belt during movement of the belt through gap G. This causes slight stretching of the wrapper to produce a tight wrap. As so far described, the wrapping concept is geometrically similar to the arrangement shown in priorUnited States Letters Patent 4,103,692. Of course, the use of the catenary belt coacting with independently driven bunches moving in a circular path is not taught by this prior United States patent. When natural tobacco leaves are used to produce wrappers W1, W2, the wrappers must be individually cut and subsequently placed into the chevron shape W, shown in FIGURE 1. Of course, if synthetic tobacco material were used for the wrappers, a compound wrapper could be cut to have this chevron shape. For that reason, whether or not the compound wrappers are integrally formed or individually formed is immaterial to the general operation of the wrapping concept. In addition, it is possible to use only a single wrapper W1 or W2 during the wrapping operation. In this instance, bunch B forms a single cigar and does not form a dual cigar C as illustrated inFIGURE 1. When natural tobacco leaves are used to form wrappers W1, W2, they are generally provided to the wrapping machine on separate bobbins, each of which includes a number of parallel arranged wrappers captured between the convolutions of a porous web material forming the bobbin. In using this type of bobbin, the wrappers are at an angle generally corresponding to the wrapping angle r of the individual wranpers as they approach a bunch B for the wrapping operation in gap G.FIGURE 1A illustrates an arrangement for producing the chevron shaped wrapper W used in the wrapping operation shown in FIGURE 1. In this illustrated arrangement, wrappers WI illustrated as single lines in FIGURE 1A are arranged in a parallel path with a wrapping angle r defining the angle of wrappers Wi with respect to the transverse direction of the web material 50 unwound from a storage bobbin A. In a like manner, wrappersW2 are provided on web material 52 from a second bobbinD. The length of the respective wrappers Wi, W2 is 1.The spacing in a longitudinal direction between adjacent wrappers on bobbins A, D is the dimension a, which in practice is approximately 2.25 inches. As can be seen in FIGURE 1A, the spacing dimension or distance a is substantially less than the product of the length of the wrappers 1 and the sine of angle r. Thus, looking from the side, the respective tuck ends and flag ends overlap each other. This close spacing is required for economic storage of the wrappers on the bobbin however, the spacing distance a is not sufficient for use in the wrapping operation as illustrated in FIGURE 1.Thus, as taught by prior United States patent application Serial No. 973,037 the longitudinal spacing between individual compound wrappers W, as they are introduced to the wrapping operation at gap G, have a longitudinal spacing b which is substantially greater than a and near the product of the length of the wrapper, i.e. 1 , and the sine of wrapping angle r. Spacing b is greater than the spacing between adjacent bunches, which in practice is about 5.0 inches. Wrappers WI, W2 are transferred onto a belt 40 in the chevron configuration shown in FIGURE 1A to resnace the wrappers WI, ç2. The tuck ends and the flag ends of the adjacent wrappers do not overlap by a substantial amount in a transverse direction with respect to belt 40.After the wrappers W1, W2 are appropriately positioned on belt 40 at the respaced distance b, the wrapping operation shown in FIGURE 1 can take place. This operation is performed, as schematically shown in FIGURE 1B, by attaching a bunch B to a wrapper W at the tuck ends 12 of wrappers 5 W2 and then wrapping the bunch in gap G. In the wranping gap G hunches B are equally spaced. wrappers move at a faster velocity than the bunches to catch up with the bunches onto which the wranpers are being wrapped.To prevent the faster moving wrappers from reaching a bunch before a preceding bunch is completed, there is provided a spacing between two wrappers which is represented as dimension b in FIGURE 1A and dimension c d in FIGURE IB. Spacing d is between the flag end of one wrapper and the tuck end of the next adjacent wrapper. This may be varied to assure that the glued tuck ends do not engage two bunches being wrapped.Since the wrappers, in practice, are lifted to the bunches distance d can be and is negative even though shown as positive in FIGURE IB. After one bunch is glued and started in the wrapping operation, another bunch coacts with the next adjacent wrapper W and starts its wrapping operation.By providing the snacing b, the advancing wrapper could be secured to a bunch B without interference with a forward wrapper even though the wrappers carried on belt 40 are moving at a greater translation velocity.As can be seen, prior wrapping concepts required respacing of the individual natural wrappers before they were placed onto a wrapper conveyor such as belt 40 so that the tucks reach a bunch B at a given position in gap G. This respacing is to at least the spacing of the bunches, which is anproximately 5.0 inches. The wrappers were traveling at a higher velocity in the wrapping gap G than the independently rotated, independently driven bunches B so the spacing b must be governed by the relative motion during winding. Inventive Wrapping Concepts Referring now to FIGURES 2 and 2A, a new wrapping concept in accordance with the present invention is illustrated wherein the various elements of FIGURE 1 are essentially the same. The bunches still have a given necessary spacing. In accordance with the new wrapping concept, wrappers W are provided on belt 40 with the flag ends 10 forward. Of course, if a single wrapper was being used, the single flag end of that wrapper would be forward of the trailing tuck end 12.Thus, when tuck ends 12 are lifted and glued to the central portion of independently rotatable bunches B, the wrappers extend forward at wrapping angle r with respect to the individual bunch. After the wrapper has been secured to a bunch B at tuck ends 12 for the individual wrappers Wi, W2, the bunch is rotated in the direction of the arrow to overrun and catch up with flag ends 10. Thus, the equally spaced bunches B traveling along path m are provided with a secured wrapper and then are rotated with respect to the wrapper to cause the wrapping operation. Since the wrappers extend forward in gap G, the velocity V1 of the equally spaced bunches B is greater than velocity V2 of the wrappers secured onto the upper surface of belt 40.In this manner, the wrapping operation starts at the entrant end of gap G and the bunches move away from the incoming supply of wrappers. Thus there can be no interference between one bunch and the next adjacent wrapper having a glued upper tuck portion, even though the spacing between adjacent wrappers is the same as the spacing on storage bobbins A, D. This concept is illustrated in FIGURE 2A, wherein the spacing b is the same as spacing distance a illustrated in FIGURE IA. Thus, in accordance with the present invention1 there is no need for respacing of the individual cigar wrappers W1, W2. These wrappers are secured onto the rotating bunches and are peeled from belt 40 as the bunches move away from the incoming wrappers at a velocity greater than the speed of the incoming wrappers.The rotating bunch and wrapper form dual cigar C, as shown in FIGURE 2, which dual cigar is subsequently severed to produce two cigars Cl, C2, each of which has a mouth end 30 or 32. As in the prior wrapping concept, the surface speed or velocity VR of rotating bunches B is slightly greater than the surface speed necessary to wrap the wrappers around the bunches. Thus, a slight amount of tension is created to stretch the wrappers Wi, W2 during the wranping operation which peels the wrappers from their fixed position on belt 40 as the belt passes through gap G. Consequently, the same end product is obtained when using the new wrapping concept shown inFIGURE 2 without requiring respacing of the individual wrappers before the wrapping operation. A fewer number of bunch nests are necessary to obtain the same production rate as the prior wrapping concept shown inFIGURE 1, with the same bunch or nest spacing. This reduces the number of nests necessary for supporting bunches B as they are translated along path m and are rotated independently of the structure supporting the nests. Independent rotation indicates that the individual bunches B are driven and are not rotated by frictionally engaging an element extending in the arcuate path defined by belt 40 carrying wrappers W.Of course, all of the bunches could be rotated in unison by a common rotating mechanism, which mechanism does not form a part of the present invention. The relative velocities V1, V2 and the rotational velocity of bunches B can be adjusted to obtain the desired rolling operation. The wrappers are completely wrapped around the bunches B at a position in gap G determined by the length of the wrappers and velocity VR. By rotating bunches B at a velocity greater than the actual wrapping velocity, not only is tension provided to stretch the wrappers to facilitate better wrapping, but also, it is assured that bunchesB will not advance over the wrappers W at a translation velocity Vi which is greater than that necessary for the actual wrapping process. This therefore provides a certain amount of tolerance in the relative relationship between velocity V1, V2. Referring now to FIGURES 3 and 4, theseFigures illustrate the relationship of the various velocities in the prior art wrapping concept illustrated in FIGURE 3 and the new wrapping concept illustrated inFIGURE 4. As can be seen, surface velocity or wrapping velocity VR for pulling wrappers onto bunches B is controlled by the relationship between velocities Vi,V2. This velocity VR thus can be used to determine the rotational velocity of the various bunches B in each of the wrapping operations. In the inventive concept of the present invention, the wrapping velocity VR is the velocity of bunches B minus the velocity V2 of the forwardly extending wrappers W.If the wrappers were held stationary, V2 would be zero therefore, the wrapping velocity would equal the translation velocity V1 of bunches B as they move along path m, which in the illustrated embodiments of FIGURES 1 and 2 is circular. Preferred Embodiment of the Present Invention Referring now to FIGURES 5 and 6, a machine for practicing the wrapping operation schematically illustrated in FIGURE 2, is depicted. As has been previously explained, this same machine could be used for the wrapping operation illustrated in FIGURE 1 however, that is not the preferred use of the illustrated machine. In accordance with this illustrated machine, continuous flexible elongated conveyor belt 40 has an upper surface 40a with vacuum directing apertures formed into wrapper matching areas 60 having essentially the pattern of wrappers W as discussed in connection withFIGURE 2. These areas defined by vacuum apertures are arranged in a parallel pattern so that the wrappers can be captured onto surface 40a in the manner shown inFIGURES 2, 2A and 5.Catenary portion 46 of belt 40 has a preselected length which remains fixed to provide a vacuum carrying surface for wrappers W which is generally concentric to axis y of path m traveled by rotating bunches B, shown best in FIGURES 2 and 6. To maintain this fixed curvature there are provided spaced openings 62 along each edge 64, 66 of belt 40. These openings engage pegs 70 on roller 44 and pegs 72 on roller 42 in a manner similar to a motion picture film strip. Rollers 42, 44 are driven in unison by a driven sprocket 80 rotatably mounted on frame F and driven by an appropriate motor, not shown. An idler sprocket 82 combines with a sprocket 90 on roller 42 and a sprocket 92 on roller 44 to carry a chain 84 which is driven by sprocket 80. Although not shown, an idler sprocket similar to sprocket 82 is provided on the opposite side of sprocket 80.By positively driving rollers 42, 44 at the same speed and engaging belt 40 with pegs 70, 72, the length of belt 40 between the rollers is constant and defines a constant catenary portion 46 which has been previously described for moving wrappers W through the wrapping gap G. A lower fixed idler roller 100 is employed to form belt 40 with generally flat straight runs 40b, 40c, which runs are used to transfer wrappers W1, W2 from the webs 50, 52 of bobbins A, D onto the wrapper matching areas 60 of belt 40. The wrappers lie in the chevron shape of the pattern defined by areas 60 spaced uniformly along belt 40. In the illustrated embodiment, a tension adjusting roller 102 is rotatably supported on shaft 104 by a lever 106 on frame F. An adjusting bracket 108 adjusts the tension in belt 40.To maintain wrappers W onto the outwardly facing surface 40a of belt 40, vacuum must be directed to the apertures of areas 60 from the time the wrappersW1, W2 are transferred to the belt to the time the wrappers are pulled from the belt during the wrapping operation. To accomplish this, various vacuum systems could be provided. In accordance with the illustrated embodiment, roller 42 is of the type with an outer perforated surface allowing vacuum to be directed through the perforations to the outer surface. This outer surface engages belt 40 at the inner surface of the belt to draw a vacuum through the surface of roller 42 and through the openings or apertures defining the various wrapper receiving areas 60. In a like manner, a vacuum chamber or box 109 is formed by a plurality of plates two of which are illustrated as plates 110, 112.Box 109 is connected to a vacuum source so that vacuum from the box is applied to the under surface of belt 40 in the area between rollers 130, 44, as illustrated inFIGURES 5 and 6. The use of vacuum boxes and other vacuum systems is well known in the cigar making art and various arrangements could be used for maintaining a vacuum onto the under surface of belt 40 in the areas necessary to capture and hold the wrappers W into the pattern shown in FIGURES 2 and 5 preparatory to and during wrapping. Bobbin A having captured wrappers thereon is used to direct wrappers W1 onto the outer portion of the spaced areas 60. In a like manner, bobbin D is used to direct wrappers W2 on the opposite side of the spaced areas 60 as belt 40 is moved along the path of belt 40 between rollers 130, 44. Referring now to bobbin A, a peeling vacuum surface roll 120 peels the web forming bobbin A from the bobbin. This roller has an outer vacuum surface so that wrappers WI are held onto the web 50 being pulled from bobbin A. A vacuum transfer table 122 at run 40b has an upwardly facing generally flat vacuum surface over which web 50 carrying wrappersW1 is pulled. The speed of web 50 is controlled so that it corresponds with the speed of belt 40.Thus, at the end of table 122 there is a decrease in vacuum or a vented portion common in vacuum transfer tables so that as web 50 passes from table 122 the vacuum in the box 109 holds wrappers W1 onto a portion of areas 60 provided at the outer edge of belt 40. After passing from the vacuum table, web 50 no longer carries a wrapper and it passes to a drive web take up spool 124.As shown in FIGURE 6 in the preferred embodiment guide rolls 125, 126, and 128 are used to direct empty web 50 to the take up spool. Thus, by driving web 50 at the steed of belt 40 as it passes over table 122, wrappers from bobbin A are transferred to one portion of the areas 60 on surface 40a of belt 40. Bobbin A moves toward roller 120 as it decreases in size to maintain a direct transfer relationship. The same basic operation is used to transfer wrappers W2 to the opposite side of areas 60 on surface 40a. To accomplish this, there is provided a peeling roll 130 having an outer vacuum surface as previously explained with respect to roll 120. A vacuum transfer table 132 holds web 52 against surface 40a and moves in unison with the surface as belt 40 moves from roller 102 toward roller 100 in the straight run 40c. A driven take up spool 134 is used to pull web 52 and store the web after wrappers ssT2 have been removed therefrom. Thus, one wrapper is deposited onto belt 40 at run 40b and another wrapper is deposited on the belt in run 40c.This forms the two wrappers into the chevron wrapper W as previously described. As can be seen, there is no respacing of the wrappers on bobbins A, D and the spacing of the wrappers on surface 40a of conveyor belt 40 is the same as the snacing of wrappers W1 2 on bobbins A, D. In practice, the spacing of the wrappers on the bobbins may be slightly different from the spacing provided on belt 40. This can vary from bobbin to bobbin or in a bobbin. Thus, provisions are made to drive webs 50, 52 at slightly varying speeds which do not affect transfer to belt 40. Consequently1 the spacing on belt 40 and on the bobbins is substantially the same, lfith this qualification. Referring now more particularly to FIGURE 6, there is illustrated an arrangement for applying glue to the tuck ends 12 of wrappers Wi, W2. Any appropriate arrangement could be used however, in the illustrated embodiment a glue supply 150 is transferred through a transfer roll 152 to an application roll 154. This roll applies the desired glue pattern onto the tuck ends of wrappers W1 W2 as they pass over roll 42.Also, a belt cleaning device 160 can be provided between rollers 44 and 102. This is illustrated as a jet cleaning device wherein air jets are used to direct air through belt 40 to clean the apertures forming wrapper receiving areas 60. Other arrangements could be used for cleaning the belt if necessary. To supply the bunches B to wrapping gap G, there is provided a drum 200 rotated at a constant speed by a shaft 201. This drum includes nests 202 each of which includes two generally fixed, parallel longitudinally serrated driven rods 210, 212 and two bunch capturing rods 214, 216 which are open to receive or release bunches from the nests and are closed to capture bunches thereon. At least rolls 210, 212 are driven to rotate bunches B about their longitudinal axes x and at a wranping surface velocity VR as described. Thus, rotatable rods 214, 216 are opened to open the nests 202. A bunch B is then placed into the nest and rods 214, 216 are closed. This is generally by a camming action. The rods are rotated to rotate bunches as previously described.In practice the arcuate spacing between nests 202 is approximately five inches and the spacing between adjacent wrappersW is approximately 2.25 inches. Bunches B are rotated at least in gap G and this rotation performs the wranping function described in connection with FIGURE 2. Various arrangements could be used for directing bunches B to the nests 202. In the illustrated embodiment, a plurality of axially oriented, parallel bunches B are provided in hopper 220 having an outlet feed magazine 222 which directs the bunches individually in parallel relationship to a transfer spider wheel 224 which is somewhat standard in cigar making machinery.Rotation of the spider wheel directs bunches B to the nests 202 where rods 214, 216 are cammed inwardly to capture the bunch at the intersection between drum 200 and wheel 224. Thereafter, drum 200 carries the nests 202 through the wrapping operation as described above.This forms a dual or double cigar C when two wrappers are used as illustrated in the preferred embodiment.Of course a single cigar could be produced. To remove the dual cigar C from drum 200 there is provided a second transfer spider wheel 230 having knotches that engage a cigar C on drum 200. At this time, rods 214, 216 are opened and an appropriate arrangement is used to capture cigars C on transfer wheel 230. In the preferred embodiment, flag ends 10 of wrappers W1, i2 have been roughly formed into the mouth portions 30, 32 in accordance with standard wrapping practice. To finalize the formation of the mouth portions 30, 32 transfer wheel 230 moves the dual cigars onto a final knurling wheel 240 from which the finished knurled dual cigars C are transferred by a spider wheel 250 to the final outlet of the machine illustrated in FIGURES 5 and 6.A pair of spaced rotating slicing cutters or blades 260, 262 cut the dual cigar C into to sectionsCi, C2 to form two cigars each of which has a mouth end 30 or 32 and a fire end 24a or 24b. These finished cigars are directed from wheel 250 through a chute 270 for subsequent packaging and distribution. The operation of the apparatus as shown inFIGURES 5 and 6 performs the winding concept illustrated in FIGURES 2 and 2A however, other machines could be used for performing this same function. As can be seen, the bunches B are independently driven in the winding operation. The driving speeds can be slightly greater than the speed necessary for wrapping so that a slight amount of tension can be used when pulling the wrappersW from belt 40. Also, the machine does not require frictional engagement of bunches B with a surface for causing rotation of the bunches during the wrapping operation. Such an arrangement dictates the rotational velocity and the velocity is dependent upon a friction action which is not utilized in the machine illustrated in FIGURES 5 and 6. Referring now to FIGURES 7 and 7A, a tuck lifter 280 is shown for lifting tuck ends 12 of wrapperW into engagement with bunch B at the start of the wrapping operation. The lifter is pivoted on trunnion 282 secured to the inner portion of roller 42 which has vacuum holes 42a and has a lower cam follower plate 284 and an upstanding finger or fingers 285. A fixed cam inside of roller 42 engages plate 284 forcing fingers 285 through opening 42b in roller 42 and openings 40f in belt 40. The area 60 is formed from apertures 40e as shown in FIGURE 7. In this manner, tuck ends of wranpers W1, W2 are secured to a bunch B by previously applied glue 290 for subsequent wrapping.
