# Composite pallet for a reactive ion etching system.

## Abstract
A composite pallet 25 for a reactive ion etching system consisting of an upper surface 27 made of an insulative material, such as, silicon having therein a plurality of recessed pockets 29 for holding the wafers to be etched and a bottom surface 28 made of conductive material, such as, aluminum for electrically and thermally communicating the wafers with the cathode 15 . The pallet diameter is larger than that of the cathode, but due to the conductive bottom surface the cathode is effectively extended over the entire pallet diameter. Such an arrangement provides excellent etch uniformity over all portions of the pallet.
