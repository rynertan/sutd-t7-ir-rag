## Description
DESCRIPTION 3 CHLOROBENZYL 3, 6 DICHLORO 2 METHOXYBENZOATE. The present invention relates to the new compound, 3 chlorobenzyl 3,6 dichloro 2 methoxybenzoate. It also relates to the use of this new compound to increase the recoverable sugar in sugarcane, citrus and grapes. In the use of the compound of the present invention to increase the recoverable sugar in sugarcane, sugarcane is normally treated at a late stage of development of the sugarcane wherein most of the sugar formation takes place. Thus, under normal growing conditions and common cultivation practices the active compound of the present invention can be applied to the sugarcane during the period of from about 2 to about 10 weeks before harvesting. The amount of active compound of the present invention required to effectively increase the recoverable sugar from sugarcane can vary somewhat depending on such factors as the time of application, the weather, crop density, method of application and the like. Generally, an amount of at least 0.56 grams per acre at least 0.05 pounds per acre and preferably an amount of from about 0.56 grams per acre to about 56 grams per acre from about 0.05 pounds per acre to about 5 pounds per acre can be used. While an amount greater than those mentioned can be used, they will not result in an advantage that would warrant their expense and are, therefore, not practical. For practical use in treating sugarcane, the active compound of this invention is generally incorporated into compositions or formulations which comprise an inert carrier and an effective amount of the compound. The compositions enable the active compound to be conveniently applied to the sugarcane at the desired rate. The formulations can be liquid formulations such as emulsifiable concentrates or solutions or solid formulations such as dusts, granules or wettable powders. The preferred compositions are liquid formulations, particularly solutions or emulsifiable concentrates. Emulsifiable concentrates comprise the active compound of the present invention, and as the inert carrier, a solvent and an emulsifier. Such emulsifiable concentrates can be extended with water and or oil to any desired concentration of active compound for application as sprays to the sugarcane.The emulsifier most commonly used in these concentrates are nonionic or mixtures of nonionic with anionic surface active agents. With the use of some emulsifier systems an inverted emulsion water in oil can be prepared. In addition it has been found that the recoverable sugar content of citrus can be increased by applying to the citrus an effective amount of the compound 3 chlorobenzyl 3 , 6 dichloro 2 methoxybenzoate. The term citrus includes, but is not limited to, tangerines, oranges, limes, lemons, grapefruit and related plants. In practising the present invention it is important to realize that the sugar content tends to fluctuate from citrus plant to citrus plant.Therefore, application of the compound will not result the same increase in sugar level in the same amount of time. Generally, the compounds should be applied at from about 4 to about 40 days prior to the intended harvest time. In some plants it may be possible to increase the sugar level by application as little as 4 days prior to harvest, whereas in the majority of cases, application at from about 7 to about 28 days prior to harvest is preferable. The compounds are applied at a rate of from about 0.7 to about 35 grams per acre from about 1 to about 50 ounces per acre about 1.4 to about 3.5 grams per acre about 2 to about 5 ounces per acre are optimal. Above 3.5 grams per acre 5 ounces per acre the increase in effect is nominal, especially in view of the increased cost of the compound applied. Also it has been found that the recoverable sugar content of grapes can be increased by applying to the grapes or the vines on which they are growing an effective amount of the compound 3 chlorobenzyl 3,6 dichloro 2 methoxybenzoate. The term grape as used herein means the European species Vitis vinifera and selected North American species as well as their hybrids and cultivated varieties and includes, for example, ThompsonSeedless, Perlette, Rebeir, Seedless Tokay,Interlocken, Delaware, Tokay, Emperor, Black Corinth,Concord, Himrod, Niagara, Aurore, De Chunac,Chancellor, Delight, Zinfandel, Carignane, Palomino,Petite Sirah, Kyoho, Yaghooti, Chenin Blanc, CabernetSauvignon and Sauvignon Blanc. In practising the present invention it is important to realize that the sugar content tends to fluctuate from season to season and from.vine to vine. Therefore, application of the compound will not result the same increase in sugar level in the same amount of time. Generally, the compounds should be applied at from about 4 to about 40 days prior to the intended harvest time. In some vines it may be possible to increase the sugar level by application as little as 4 days prior to harvest, whereas in the majority of cases, application from about 7 to about 28 days prior to harvest is preferable. The compounds are applied at a rate of from about 0.7 to about 35 grams per acre from 1 to 50 ounces per acre and about 1.4 to about 3.5 grams per acre about 2 to about 5 ounces per acre are optimal.Above 3.5 grams per acre 5 ounches per acre the increase in effect is nominal, especially in view of the increased cost of the compound applied. The compounds are employed in the form of aqueous solutions of dispersions. Generally, where the application device is a spray gun, boom or other device where the solution is expressed through a narrow orifice by pressure, the application rate is 50 to 200 gallons of solution per acre. Where the application is by means of an air sprayer e.g. a speed sprayer , i.e the solution is entrained in a fast moving air stream, more concentrated solutions are employed and about 5 to 50 gallons per acre can be used. Regardless of the amount of solution employed, the pounds of active ingredients per acre should be within the ranges described above. The compounds are employed in the form of aqueous solutions or dispersions. Generally, where the application device is a spray gun, boom or other device where the solution is expressed through a narrow orifice by pressure, the application rate is 4.47 to 18.71 litres of solution per acre 50 to 200 gallons of solution per acre . Where the application is by means of an air sprayer e.g. a speed sprayer , i.e. the solution is entrained in a fast moving air stream, more concentrated solutions are employed and about 1.87 to 18.71 litres per acre about 5 to 50 gallons per acre can be used.Regardless of the amount of solution employed, the amount of active ingredients in grams per acre ounces or pounds per acre should be within the ranges described above. In the aqueous solutions employed for any of sugar cane, citrous and grapes, it is preferred to use a surfactant to prevent the solution from forming globules and rolling off upon contact with the leaves of the plant. The surfactant level is generally from 0.1 to 1 1 25 preferred. Suitable surfactants which can be employed include sorbitan monolaurate sorbitan monopalmitate sorbitan monostearate sorbitan mono oleate sorbitan trioleate polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate polyoxyethylene sorbitan monopalmitate polyoxyethylene sorbitan monostearate polyoxyethylene sorbitan tristearate polyoxyethylene sorbitan mono oleate polyoxyethylene sorbitan trioleate polyoxyethylene cetyl ether polyoxyethylene stearyl ether and polyoxyethylene oleyl ether. The above materials are commonly available under trade names such as Tween , Span , Brij and Carbowax . Other surfactants which reduce surface tension can also be employed. The present invention will now be further described with reference to, but is in no manner limited to, the following Examples, wherein all parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise specified.
