# Seal and microwave appliance incorporating it.

## Abstract
To effect an efficient seal between two relatively movable members of a microwave appliance e.g. the door and door frame of a microwave oven, a sealing strip 20 is made in a finely tapering shape and from an electrically conductive elas tomeric material such as a highly loaded silicone based rub ber. The taper is to point towards the interior of the appliance being sealed so as to present a surface 38 at a low, angle of incidence to radiation 50 , while the whole of the surface 34 of the sealing strip which is at a low taper angle to the surface 38 is in thermal contact with the device e.g. the door frame 32 . The angle between the surfaces 34 and 38 is of the order of 8 1 2 . To allow effective sealing of and thermal contact with the other movable part e.g. the door 30 , the thicker end of the strip should be compressed by approximately 1 3 of its relaxed thickness and for this purpose it may be made of greater compliance than the remainder of the strip by the presence of a hole 28 .

## Description
This invention relates to an elongate sealing strip which is for use in sealing two members which move relatively. The members may open and close being e.g. a door and its frame, or may slide or rotate relative to each other. Particular examples are a door seal for a space exposed to microwave radiation, e.g. microwave ovens, or a gas seal between relatively rotatable chambers containing pressurised gases in microwave radar installations.The invention further relates to appliances having such a seal. Microwaves are considered to be a serious health hazard so that it is necessary to achieve a highly efficient seal between the members. Such sealing must be effective in two respects it must ensure that there are no gaps left between members through which radiation might escape unchallenged, and it must also be capable of absorbing and dissipating the radiation incident on it so as to remain effective throughout use. For a microwave oven, ordinary door seals, such as are used for refrigerator doors, cannot be used since absorption of the microwave radiation results in excessively high temperatures being generated in the seal, resulting in failure of the seal. Similarly special seals are required where microwave radiations are to be contained in radar installations. The problem therefore is to design a seal in which the desired sealing function is combined with shape adapted to dissipate heat generated by microwaves. The problem of sealing such appliances has been realised as long as the appliances have existed.The use of electrically conductive resinous material in microwave oven seals has been seen for example in GBPS 1010922 where a channel in a door frame is filled with a rigid resin loaded with graphite as conductive absorbent and an electrically conductive elastomeric gasket with an enlarged bead within the microwave enclosure is seen in GBPS1114938. It has also been proposed, in GBPS 1351457 and 1424888 to use sealing gaskets of an electrically conductive elastomeric material, but in both cases they are secondary radiation absorbers, being placed beyond a choke as a primary absorber. It can be seen therefore that the problem of heat dissipation to prevent breakdown of a sealing stop capable of use as a sole or primary seal, simply has not been appreciated or else has been avoided, in the stated prior art. The present invention faces this problem by providing a sealing strip which is elastomeric and therefore can be compressed between members to be sealed for efficient contact with them, and yet is of a conformation allowing efficient absorption of microwaves and efficient dispersion of the heat arising as a result of that absorption. This problem is solved in that the strip of conductive elastomeric material is given a finely tapering section. A first of the major surfaces of the section will be maintained irl overall contact with one of the members to be sealed while the second of the major surfaces is in partial contact with the other member, the thicker end portion of the strip being compressed preferably by about 1 3 of its relaxed thickness between those members. To allow compression of the thicker Dortion it is preferably made more compliant than the remainder, most sllitably by a hole or holes being formed within that portion. This contorn tion ana mode of use gives highly efficient radiation absorption and highly efficient heat dispersion to the members being sealed. In use, such a seal is fixed preferably adhesively to a surface of one member e.g. the door or door frame, with the narrow end located interiorly of the wider portion. The thicker portion provides the sealing function, the hole or holes givin it the desired compliant characteristics for this purpose. Cf7e second major surface acts to absorb incident microwave radiation but the strip being thin in section and therefore offering a high surface area transverse to the direction of impingement of microwave, it is readily able to transfer the heat generated to the members which it contacts, especially to that to which it is secured over all the first major surfaces. referbly the strip has a triangular cross soctio. The angle between the two tapering sides will be les than 300, srefcrably 7 to 12 , most preferably 8 . A finely tapering triangular section for an element in a microwave installation has been proposed before. This was for the load which terminates the path of microwave radiation. An example is seen inGBPS 1105088 where, however, the wedge shape had probably been adopted to avoid back reflections which would damage the generator, that appliance being designed to operate in a travelling wave mode. The material of the element is not elastomeric it is not a seal and heat dissipation is by means of internal watercooling. The present seal is effective as such because there is progressive attenuation of the incident microwave energy as it is transmitted through and absorbed by the strip, so that tulle proportion of incident energy reaching the surface of the strip outside the appliance is very small, whilst at the same time, because there is a very large area of contact between the elastomer and at least one of the members, and because the radiation absorbing volume of elastomer is very thin in section so that the target for radiation is thin and no part of the elastomer is remote from the surface of the member to which it is fixed, the heat resulting from absorption of microwave radiation is efficiently dissipated into the surface to which the strip is fixed, thus keeping the material of the strip at an acceptably low temperature. An embodiment of the invention, illustrating its application to a microwave oven, will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawing wherein Fig.l shows a transverse cross section of an elongate seal according to the present invention, and Fig.2 shows in cross section the seal of Fig.1 in use in a microwave oven. As is een in Fig.1 the sealing strip 20 is formed 5 extrusion to have a uniform triangular cross section. the sides of the triangle offered by major surfaces 22 and 24 of the strio being sub stantially longer in proportion to the third side,26.The triangle is right angled, the angle 27 at the small apex being 8 . A hole 28 extends longitudinally continuously through the strip, parallel with and adjacent to the surface of the strip which corresponds with the side 26 in cross section, and to produce more compliance. The strip 20 is of highly electrically conducting silicone rubber e.g. a silicone based rubber highly loaded it high structure carbon black, and the lrjnqths of the cross sectiol sides 2C and 24 are in this embodiment 3mm and 2Omm respectively. Fig.2 the eal in operation between a mic owave oven door 30 and the oven door frame 32 The surface 24 of the strip is adhesively fixed to the surface 34 of the door franc. The oven door 30 is closed and held by some fasteninn means so that the aa . 36 between ove l door and rrounds is approximat ely 2 . This can be achieved because the preset of the hole 28 adds compliance to the thicker end of the strip, so that there is substantial contact between the strip 20 and the oven door 30 in the region 40. Klen the microwave oven is in use, radiation travelling generally in the direction shown by the arrow 50 will be incident at a low angle of incidence on the whole area of the surface 22 of the strip.This radiation is absorbed by the rubber and the heat resulting is dissipated through the rubber into the door frame, 32. Since there is substantial thermal contact with the oven door frame 32 at the surface 34, and since at any point on the surface 22 the distance to the surface 34 is small, the energy is largely dissipated in a very thin section of rubber so that the temperature increase is minimised. It is estimated that radiation leakage will be within acceptable limits if the seal attenuates the energy to one twentieth of that incident on the strip. On passing the radiation through a strip of the highly conducting silicone rubber lmm thick the microwave energy can be reduced by a factor of 10,000. Thus the seal according to the invention produces highly effective protection against the escape of microwaves while avoiding the generation of high temperatures even in a period of extended use. The material of the seal may be any elastomeric material having suitable conductvity and resilience properties, for example, highly conducting silicone rubber, or, if the operatinq temperatures can be kept below approximato 130 C, ordinary carbon based rubbers. The cross section of the strip need not necessarily be triangular, or, if it is triangular, need not include a right angle. Both acute and obtuse angled triangles can be used, but it is preferred that the angle between the two working surfaces i.e. that on which radiation is incident and that fixed to the surround is less than 300, preferably between 70 and o 12 . Non triangular tapering shapes such as a trapezium are also included in the scope of the invention. The hole or holes extending through the seal serves to allow further compliance and as such need not necessarily be round in cross section. The hole should be positioned within the wider portion of the seal, in the case of a right angled triangle, within a distance from the shorter side comparable with the length of that shorter side, in the present embodiment about 3mm. The present strip had a maximum thickness of 3 mm in its relaxed state. The strip embodying the invention should be as thin as possible bearing in mind the need for a balance between the conflicting requirements of maximum thinness to aid heat dispersion and a thickness sufficient to give a good seal between the members, especially in view of manufacturing tolerances in them.
