## Description
DESCRIPTION ALCOHOL CARBONYLATION CATALYSTS The present invention relates to alcohol carbonylation catalysts. More particularly, the present invention relates to highly valuable solid catalysts used for the production of monocarboxylic acids or their esters by reacting an alcohol with carbon monoxide. For the production of a monocarboxylic acid or its ester by the carbonylation reaction of an alcohol with carbon monoxide, there has been employed broadly and practically a process wherein the reaction is carried out in the liquid phase in the presence of a cobalt compound such as cobalt acetate as a catalyst and an iodine compound such as potassium iodide or methyl iodide as a co catalyst. However, this process must be carried out under severe reaction conditions comprising a temperature of 210 to 2500C and a pressure of 490 to 700 atm in order to maintain a stable, sufficient catalytic activity, since it is considered that the catalyst must be present in the form of a metal carbonyl under the reaction conditions. Further, according to this process, the reaction selectivity is low and, therefore, an aldehyde, carbon dioxide and hydrogen are by produced and the ultimate yield of acetic acid in a commercial plant is as low as about 59 based on carbon monoxide or about 87 based on methanol.Anothesr disadvantage of this process is that a reaction vessel made of an expensive anti corrosive material must be used, since the liquid reaction system contains corrosive compounds such as acetic acid and iodides. Recently, there has been developed a process for the carbonylation of methanol wherein a rhodium complex is used as a catalyst and methyl iodide or hydrogen iodide is used as a co catalyst see the specification of Japanese Patent Publication No. 334 1972 . According to this process, the reaction proceeds under mild conditions comprising a temperature of 175 to 2450C and a pressure of 10 to 30 atm and yield of acetic acid is as high as 90 based on carbon monoxide or 99 based on methanol. However, this process has a serious problem that remarkably expensive rhodium, of which availability on the market is limited because of its poor natural resources, must be used as the catalyst. In addition, a problem of the corrosion of the apparatus is unavoidable, since an iodide is used in liquid phase. There have been proposed processes for the carbonylation of methanol using a nickel catalyst in liquid phase. For example, there have been proposed processes wherein the carbonylation reaction of methanol is carried out in the presence of an organotin compound Japanese Patent Laid Open No. 59615 1978 , an organic nitrogen compound Japanese Patent Laid Open No. 59211 1979 or an organophosphorus III compound JapanesePatent Laid Open No. 66614 1979 in addition to a nickel catalyst under a carbon monoxide pressure of up to 50 atm. However, the above mentioned processes wherein the nickel catalyst is used in the liquid phase is economically disadvantageous, since an expensive iodine compound used as a co catalyst is required in a large amount more than 20 molar based on methanol .Further, in these processes, the reactor is corroded and volatile, virulently poisonous nickel carbonyl is formed to pose a problem of operation safety. The inventors made intensive investigations for the purposes of overcoming the defects of the abovementioned, conventional techniques and developing an effective catalyst which is free from the problems of corrosion of the reaction apparatus and operation safety and which facilitates the operation. As a result, the inventors have found that a catalyst comprising an active ingredient such as nickel supported on a carbonaceous carrier such as activated carbon or carbon black meets the purposes and that if such a catalyst is used, the carbonylation of an alcohol proceeds efficiently in the gas phase and the above mentioned problems of corrosion of the reaction apparatus and operation safety can be solved. The present invention has been completed on the basis of these findings.The present invention provides an alcohol carbonylation catalyst which comprises nickel, cobalt or a compound thereof supported on a carbonaceous carrier. The carrier of the catalyst of the present invention must be carbonaceous. Particular examples of the carrier are activated carbon, carbon black and coke. In addition, inorganic carriers such as silica, alumina, silica alumina or zeolite on which carbon has been deposited or on which an active ingredient has been carried and then carbon has been deposited may also be used. If a substance other than the carbonaceous substance is used as the catalyst carrier, the ultimate yield of acetic acid is so small that the object of the present invention cannot be attained. As the active ingredient to be carried by the above mentioned catalyst carrier, there may be used nickel, cobalt or a compound thereof. Among them, nickel is particularly preferred. It is supposed that this active ingredient is converted into a partially carbonylated metal compound in the reaction and, therefore, the starting material may be a metal or metal compound. The active ingredient carrying rate of the catalyst is not particularly limited and it may be determined properly. Generally, the carrying rate is in the range of 0.1 to 50 wt. , preferably 0.5 to 20 wt. . The carbonylation of an alcohol in the presence of the catalyst of the present invention comprising the above mentioned carrier and active ingredient is carried out generally under the following conditions said catalyst and a volatile halogen compound such as an iodine compound or bromine compound as a cocatalyst are added to the reaction system. The cocatalyst is preferably an alkyl iodide such as methyl iodide or an alkyl bromide such as methyl bromide.The amount of the co catalyst is not particularly limite and is generally in the range of O.i to 50 mol, preferably 1 to 20 mol, per 100 mol of the alcohol.Further, a promotor may be added to the reaction system to enhance the reaction velocity. As preferred promotors, there may be mentioned metals such as alkali metals, iron, copper, silver, molybdenum, chromium, tungsten, tin and manganese as well as their compounds. The ratio of the alcohol to carbon monoxide in the feed to the reactor can be stoichiometric. However, the ratio is not always limited to the stochiometric ratio but either of them may be used in excess. Generally, the molar ratio of the alcohol to carbon monoxide is in the range of 100 1 to 1 100, preferably 10 1 to 1 10. It is unnecessary to use pure carbon monoxide. Carbon monoxide having some impurities may also be used. Water as an impurity in carbon monoxide causes no problem in the reaction.Further, the catalytic activity is not affected by small a mount of hydrogen. However, the presence of a large amount of hydrogen is undesirable, since the amount of methane by produced is increased. The alcohols used as the starting material include, for example, methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol or benzyl alcohol. Among them, methanol or benzyl alcohol is particularly preferred. A reason therefor is that if methanol or benzyl alcohol is used, the dehydration reaction does not occur in the course of the carbonylation reaction and, therefore, the intended monocarboxylic acid or its ester is obtained in a quite high yield. It is desirable that the reaction effected in the presence of the catalyst of the present invention is carried out under such conditions that both starting materials and product are in the gaseous state.However, the reaction proceeds without any trouble even if a high boiling material such as an alcohol or monocarboxylic acid is present in liquid form. The reaction temperature should be 100 to4000C, preferably 150 to 3500C. The reaction pressure should be 0.1 to 300 atm, preferably 1 to 100 atm. The catalyst of the present invention has the following merits 1 it is a solid catalyst which is advantageous from the viewpoint of the mechanism and which can be handled easily because of its physical and chemical properties, 2 the active ingredient is not an expensive noble metal such as rhodium but is an inexpensive base metal, and 3 the catalyst is usable also in a fluidized bed typereactor in which the temperature control and heat removal are easy.Further, if the carbonylation reaction is carried out in the presence of this catalyst, an excellent productSvity can be obtained at a relatively low temperature under a low pressure and an intended monocarboxylic acid or its ester which per se is useful and is easily convertible into the monocarboxylic acid and alcohol can be obtained with a high selectivity.In addition, since the reaction carried out in the presence of the catalyst of the present invention proceeds in the gas phase, the reaction apparatus is virtually not corroded and even if by products are formed, they can be separated out of the intended product and easily disposed of. As described above in detail, the catalyst of the present invention can be used broadly in the chemical field as an extremely effective catalyst for the production of a monocarboxylic acid from an alcohol. The following examples will further illustrate the present invention.Example 1 A commercially available activated carbon Shirasagi C product of Takeda Yakuhin Kogyo Co.,Ltd. was pulverized and 20 to 40 mesh fraction was collected. 100 g of the fraction was added to an aqueous nickel nitrate solution containing 2.5 g of metallic nickel.
