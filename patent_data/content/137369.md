# Method for electrolytic treatment.

## Abstract
A method for continuously electrolytically processing a metal web in which the consumption rate of graphite electrodes is remarkably reduced. Auxiliary anodes made of a nonreactive material are provided separately from the graphite electrodes. One half of a symmetrical waveform is applied directly between the graphite electrodes, while for the other half of the waveform, a portion of the current is distributed through the auxiliary anodes. In this manner, the magnitude of the current contributing to a cathode reaction on the surfaces of the graphite electrodes is made larger than the magnitude of the current contributing to an anode reaction on the surfaces of the graphite electrodes, thereby reducing the consumption rate of the graphite electrodes.
