# High density fluid for use in wells.

## Abstract
An environmentally compatible high density drilling or blow out control fluid is provided wherein densities between 2.88 and 4.80 g cmÂ³ can be achieved. The fluid is aqueous based, uses a non toxic gelling agent such as fine iron oxide powder, a coarser first weighting material such as fine iron powder, and optionally a second still coarser weighting material such as iron shot, steel shot or mixtures thereof.
