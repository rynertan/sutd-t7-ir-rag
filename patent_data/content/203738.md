## Description
Description Curable Organopolysiloxane CompositionField of the Invention This invention relates to novel polysiloxane compositions and their preparation. More particularly the invention relates to novel compositions of general purpose organopolysiloxanes and a polysiloxane crosslink additive having at least three vinyl groups.Background of the Invention Cured silicone products having a wide range of properties useful in a wide range of applications are well known, as is the formation of those products by curing organopolysi loxanes by crosslinking individual organopolysiloxanes or mixtures of various organopolysiloxanes. One particular family of organopolysiloxanes which are useful in forming adhesives and other materials are those diorganopolysiloxanes which are terminated at either or both ends of the chain with vinyl groups. Examples of such vinyl terminated polysiloxanes appear in U.S. patent 4,196,273 to Imai et al.Vinyl terminated polysiloxanes may be crosslinked with themselves or with other polysiloxanes containing various functional groups which are aryl, aliphatic saturated or unsaturated , fluoroaliphatic such as CF3CH2CH2 or containing other groups such as nitrogen groups, sulpher groups and the like.Examples of such organopolysiloxanes are shown in U.S.patents 3,624,022 to Ross, 4,064,027 to Gant, and 4,163,081 to Schulz. Diorganopolysiloxanes terminated at the chain ends with two or three vinyl groups have been crosslinked to provide elastomeric or rubber type products, as shown in U.S. patent 4,364,809 to Sato et al. The disclosures of the above patents are incorporated herein by reference with respect to the conventional and general background relative to the types of organopolysi loxane materials which may be crosslinked, the methods of crosslinking polysiloxanes, the initiators used to initiate the crosslinking and other conventional aspects of the organopolysiloxane art. In many end use applications it is desirable to use organopolysiloxane materials as sealants and as such the materials should preferably have a cone penetration of about 100 to about 350 10 1mum ASTM No. D217 68 and an ultimate elongation of at least about 100 ASTM No. D638 80 . In many uses it is desirable to have elongation values as high as 800 or greater because of the extreme deformation the material must be capable of accommodating in order to effec tively seal some substrates. it is also desirable to make such sealing materials from the most widely available and consequently lowest cost polysiloxanes, such as polydimethylsiloxanes, trimethylsiloxy terminated.Brief Description of the Drawings Figure 1 shows the cone penetration versus radiation dose for the organopolysiloxane of Example 1.

Description of the Invention It has been found that mixtures of organopolysiloxanes having no vinyl unsaturation or at most two vinyl groups and a polysiloxane crosslink additive having at least three vinyl groups can be crosslinked in certain proportions to provide materials of unique properties. In addition, the use of polysiloxane crosslink additive according to this invention provides certain advantages in manufacturing and processing efficiencies. In one aspect this invention provides a curable composition comprising at least about 50 by weight of an organopolysiloxane having the general formulaEMI3.1 wherein each R is H or a substituted or unsubstituted monovalent hydrocarbon group free of aliphatic unsatura tion, except that no more than two of the R groups may be CH CH2 and n is a positive integer and from about 0.5 to about 50 by weight of a polysiloxane crosslink additive having the general formulaEMI3.2 wherein each R1, R 1, R2, R 2, R3 and R 3 is H, CH CH2 or a substituted or unsubstituted hydrocarbon group, at least three of which are CH CH2, and n is a positive integer. This invention provides a method of forming crosslinked polysiloxane materials ranging from soft elastomeric properties to rubber like, high hardness properties. For some applications it is preferred that the material have a cone penetration of about 100 to about 300 mm 1 and an ultimate elongation of at least 100 . In another aspect this invention provides a method comprising forming a mixture comprising at least about 50 by weight of an organopolysiloxane having the general for mula I above, from about 0.5 to about 50 by weight of a divinyldimethyl organopolysiloxane having the general formula II above and curing said mixture to the desired degree of crosslinking. In another aspect, this invention provides a polysiloxane composition comprising an organopolysiloxane having the general formula I above, and from about 0.5 to about 50 by weight of a polysiloxane crosslink additive having the general for mula II above, wherein the degree of crosslinking thereof is sufficient to provide a material having a cone penetration of about 100 to 350 mm 1 and an ultimate elongation of at least 100X. The organopolysiloxane of general formula I useful in this invention, comprises any general purpose polysiloxane fluid conventionally available in the art having the appropriate substituents depending on the end use and properties generally desired in the crosslinked product. The organopolysiloxane should be a liquid at processing temperatures and should be compatible with the polysiloxane crosslink additive of general formula II above. A preferred organopolysiloxane is where all R groups are methyl. Another preferred organopolysiloxane is where at most two R groups are vinyl provided both are not on the same siloxane group , most preferrably one each on two separate backbone siloxane groups, and where some of the R groups on backbone siloxanes can be H. Another organopolysiloxane useful in this invention is where an R on an end group is methyl.The range of n can be from 1 to 10,000 or higher. In general n will be in the range of 1 to 5,000 and usually less than 1,000. The polysiloxane crosslink additive general formula II above, provides the composition of this invention with unique properties when mixed with an organopolysiloxane of general formula I and the mixture cured to the desired level of crosslinking. In order to obtain a three dimensional structure providing the unique properties of elongation, hardness and tensile strength, at least three of the R and or R groups on general formula II must be vinyl. These compounds are generically referred to herein as polysiloxane crosslink additives because having at least three vinyl groups. These polysiloxanes provide superior three dimensional crosslinking in the overall structure of the cured product. In general, any polysiloxane crosslink additive of general formula II may be used in this invention provided it is compatible with the organopolysiloxane of general formula I at processing temperatures and conditions used to produce the desired mixture, crosslinking and resultant composition according to this invention. A preferred polysiloxane crosslink additive for use in this invention is where at least one end group is a divinylmethyl end group. At least one divinyl group may also be in the backbone of the polysiloxane. In either case, at least one other vinyl group must be present on the opposite end group or along the backbone of the polysiloxane in order to provide the three dimensional type structures desired in this invention and to give the crosslinked materials the desired properties.When there are only three vinyl groups present, the third vinyl group in the polysiloxane crosslink additive may be on a silicone group adjacent to the divinyl group, but it is preferred that the third vinyl group be separated from the divinyl group by at least one siloxane group in order to provide better threedimensional crosslinking of the materials according to this invention. Preferred polysiloxane crosslink additives include polydimethylsiloxane methylvinyl siloxane copolymer, vinyldimethyl or trimethyl terminated having the general formulaEMI6.1 where R is H, CH3, CH CH2 or other substituted or unsubstituted monovalent hydrocarbon group, m and n are positive integers and having a molecular weight up to about 250,000. Other preferred crosslink additives include polydimethylsiloxane, divinylmethyl terminated having the formula EMI7.1 where n is a positive integer and having a molecular weight up to about 250,000. The proportion of the organopolysiloxane materials and the polysiloxane crosslink additive may vary from about 0.5 to about 50 by weight of the polysiloxane crosslink additive based on the combined weight of the two components. It is preferred to use between about 1 to about 15 by weight polysiloxane crosslink additive. The curable compositions of this invention may be cured by conventional methods of curing polysiloxanes containing vinyl unsaturation. Conventional curing and crosslinking methods include heat, chemical, ultraviolet light, and high energy radiation curing. Various catalysts and initiators are useful in accelerating the crosslinking. Heat curing can generally be done at temperatures of 500C to 2500C and is generally aided by the inclusion of a curing cataylst such as a peroxide, such as benzoylperoxide. The curable compositions of this invention may also be cured by UV light in the presence of photoinitiators such as benzophenone. Curing with high energy radiation, such as electron beam radiation or cobalt 60, is generally the preferred method for curing the compositions of this invention and can generally be accomplished in the range of 2 to 20 megarads.Such radiation curing may be done without initiators but accelerators, such as triallylcyanurate, isocyanurate may be added. The compositions of this invention may also be chemically cured by incorporating in the mixture certain compounds such as peroxides. It may also be desirable in some circumstances to combine two or more of these curing mechanisms to accomplish the desired curing in the desired time to achieve specific properties of the cured product. The curable compositions of this invention and the cured compositions made according to this invention may contain various additional ingredients such as flame retardants, corrosion inhibitors, antioxidants, UV light stablizers, fungicides and other biocides, pigments, fillers to enhance or decrease thermal or electrical conductivity and fillers to adjust density or other physical properties. Such additives or fillers also may be used to regulate or affect the rate or extent of cure and crosslinking and affect the overall cost of the final composition. The cured compositions of this invention have a wide variety of uses such as sealants, dielectrics, protective tapes and coatings. These materials can be combined with or cured on various substrates or in various devices to provide sealing, insulation or protective functions. These compositions are useful in such end uses as exemplified by copending European application publication number 0108518,European application number 86300045, and in various uses exemplified by European patent applications filed contemporaneously with the present application and in respect of which US Patent Applications nos 730692, 730404, 730405, 730691, 730699 and 730694 served to establish priority dates.In many of these uses, the cured or crosslinked composition of this invention will have a cone penetration according toASTM No. D217 68 of about 100 to about 350 mm 1 and an ultimate elongation in accordance with ASTM No. D638 80 of greater than about 200 . The present invention can be illustrated by the following examples EXAMPLE 1 In this example, a polydimethylsiloxane, trimethyl terminated, commercially available as Dow 200 from Dow Corning, having a molecular weight 62,700 and a room temperature viscosity of about 10,000 centistokes was mixed separately with each of the following compounds Molecular Viscosity No. Name Weight centistokes 1 polydimethylsiloxane 28,000 1,000 vinyldimethyl terminated available from Petrarch Systems, silicone fluid No. PS443 2 polydimethylsiloxane 28,000 1,000 methylvinylsiloxane copolymer, trimethyl terminated Formula III above Petrarch silicone fluid No. PS426 3 polydimethylsiloxane 28,000 1,000 divinylmethyl terminated Formula IV above Petrarch silicone fluid No.PS483 4 polydimethylsiloxane 28,000 1,000 methylvinylsiloxane copolymer, vinyl dimethyl terminated Formula III above Petrarch silicone fluid No. PS493 Each of the mixtures contained 5 by weight of the above compound based on the combined weight of the two components.Each of the mixtures and a sample of the polydimethylsiloxane per se were cured by electron beam radiation using a 3.5 mev electron beam. Each of the samples was placed in a 10 ml beaker having diameter of 2.22 cm 0.875 in. and subjected to the radiation doses shown in Figure 1. The cone penetration of the crosslinked material was measured according toASTM Standard No. D1403 69 and was recorded for the various radiation doses. The cone penetration versus the radiation dose for each of the five samples is shown in Figure 1. This example shows that the polysiloxane crosslink additives of this invention Nos. 2, 3 and 4 above increase the cure rate of the organopolysiloxane more than a divinyl compound No. 1 above . EXAMPLE 2 The same mixtures from Example 1 were prepared having diffent concentrations of compounds Nos. 1 4 varying up to 12 . Samples of each of the four mixtures and various concentrations were subjected to electron beam radiation dose of 8 megarads. The cone penetration of the resulting crosslinked composition was measured and recorded for each of the mixtures versus the proportion of each compound. The correlation of cone penetration with concentration is depicted in Figure 2. EXAMPLE 3 In this example, three polydimethylsiloxane materials commercially available as Dow 200 from Dow Corning having a room temperature viscosities of 1,000, 10,000, and 30,000 centistokes, respectively, were mixed with 5 by weight of polydimethylsiloxane divinylmethyl terminated crosslink additive, No. 3 in Example 1. Each of these mixtures and corresponding samples of the polydimethylsiloxane without the additive were subjected to electron beam radiation dose of 15 megarads. The cone penetration of the resulting crosslinked composition was measured according to ASTM No. D1403 69.The relative cone penetration versus the beginning viscosity of the polydimethylsiloxane fluid with and without the crosslink additive is shown in Figure 3. EXAMPLE 4 In this example, the polydimethylsiloxane from Example 1 and mixtures thereof with 4 by weight polydimethylsiloxane divinylmethyl terminated, No. 3 in Example 1, were subjected to various electron beam radiation doses then the per cent soluable material versus the per cent gelled or crosslinked material was measured for each sample. The results are set forth below in Table 1.

Exactly 10 grams of liquid of each sample was placed in a standard 20 ml glass scintillation vial then cured. A 0.25 m ball probe was used to measure hardness and adhesion at a probe speed of 2.0 mm sec. from a 4.0 mm penetraton depth.The Dow 200 Polysiloxane Fluid fromExample 1 with all methyl substitution has a room temperature viscosity of about 10,000. The samples of these polydimethylsiloxanes with the amount of the crosslink additives from Example 4 indicated in the following table were cured using 1.5 benzoylperoxide at tempuerature of 1500C under nitrogen for 1 hour. The resulting hardness and adhesion of the crosslinked material were measured in form on theVoland Stevens Anaylzer as specified above and the results are shown in the following table.

The resultant elongation versus cone penetration curves are shown in Figure 4. In the second comparative sample 5 parts of a polydimethyl 1 covinylmethylsiloxane, trimethyl terminated crosslink additive, compound PS426 from Petrarch Systems, having a viscosity of 1,000 centistokes, was used. The resultant elongation versus cone penetration curves are shown in Figure 5. In the third comparative sample 5 parts of a polydimethyl 1 covinylmethyl siloxane, dimethylvinyl terminated crosslink additive, compound PS493 from PetrarchSystems, having a viscosity of 1,000 centistokes was used.The resultant elongation versus cone penetration curves are shown in Figure 6. All samples were cured using varying amounts of benzoyl peroxide, from 0.5 to 2.0f, to vary the cone penetration of the resulting material. Curing was at 150 C under nitrogen for t hour. Cone penetration is measured according to ASTMNo. D1403 69 and elongation measured according to ASTM No.412. This example shows that this invention provides superior elongation properties for given hardness properties. EXAMPLE 7 In this example the mixture containing the crosslink additive from the first comparative sample of Example 6 was radiation cured under a 3.5 Mev electron beam at radiation doses from 5 to 11 megarads to vary the cone penetration. The elongation versus cone penetration for this mixture measured as in Example 6 is shown in Figure 7 as the curve w Additive. Next a two part organopolysiloxane system of polyvinyl methylsiloxane and polymethyl hydridesiloxane containing a platinum catalyst, KE104 Gel from Shin Etsu, was cured at t5Q C in air for varying periods of time to vary the cone penetration. The elongation versus cone penetraton for this material measured as in Example 6 is shown in Figure 7 as the w o Additive curve. This example illustrates that the crosslink additives of this invention produce materials having superior elongation properties using standard polysiloxane fluids like Dow 200, compared to more expensive systems which have very good elongation characteristics.
