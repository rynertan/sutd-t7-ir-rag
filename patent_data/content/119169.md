# Electromechanical and pneumatical device, to determine the carburettor throttle position according to engine speed during accelerator release.

## Abstract
A device of the tvpe mentioned in the above title, comprising a pneumatical capsule, that acts on the control lever of the throttle and is in communication with the engine s suction manifold and with the atmosphere. An electromagnet is governed by a control unit, which is fed with signals issued by appropriate sensors. The movable keeper of the electromagnet consists of a bushing sliding between two abutments under the effect of the magnetic field and of a spring the said bushing contains a valvular member suited to control a pipe, that puts the capsule in communication with the atmosphere.
