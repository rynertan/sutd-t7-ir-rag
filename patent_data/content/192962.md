# Idling return device for internal combustion engines.

## Abstract
An idling return mechanism 16A 16B 16C is provided with a throttle body 1 in addition to a return spring 30 and closes a throttle valve 4 to the idling degree of opening. The idling return mechanism 16A comprises a toggle joint of a diaphragm utilizing a suction vacuum of an engine such as mainly a case 18 , an operating member 13 and a lever 5 . The case 18 is separated into a vacuum chamber 9 and an atmospheric chamber 20 by a diaphragm 11 . The operat ing member 13 fixed to the diaphragm 11 . The operating member 13 fixed to the diaphragm 11 comprises an operating rod 14 and an operating spring 15 . The lever 5 fixed to the operating rod 14 is mounted on a throttle valve shaft 3 . The idling return mechanism 16B 16C comprises an electromagnetic force member such as mainly an electro magnet means 23 or a solenoid valve 25 . The idling return mechanism 16A 16B 16C is capable of reliably closing the throttle valve 4 to the idling degree of opening even when the return spring 30 is broken or damaged and is adapted to be operated only when the engine is decelerated.
