# RF tuning device comprising a switching mixer stage and a tuning oscillator.

## Abstract
RF tuning device comprising a switching mixer stage M and a tuning oscillator O coupled thereto. According to the invention, so as to reduce the noise contribution of the mixer stage M without increasing the oscillator radiation, the slew rate of the oscillator switching signal applied to the mixer stage M is increased.
