# Improvements in or relating to the production of lines of separation in a sheet or other member.

## Abstract
At least one line of separation is formed in a sheet or other member 44 by moving a heated point 4a of a tool 1a in contact with the surface of the member 44 . The tool 1a may be mounted in a mounting arrangement 40 for use in supporting the tool 1a on a head 41 of an apparatus for moving the tool. By means of the heated point, smooth clean lines of separation can be formed in the sheet or other member, in particular in the photographically opaque layer of a bilaminated plastics sheet for enabling part of the opaque layer to be removed to produce a mask for selective exposure, for example in the making of a printing plate and for contacting film.
