# Magnetic disc recording and reproducing apparatus.

## Abstract
A magnetic disc recording and reproducing apparatus for recording signals on a rotatable magnetic disc 1 comprises a recording reproducing head 5 movable in a radial direction relative to the disc 1 and an erasing head or heads 6,7 integrally mounted together with the recording reproducing head 5 for immediately erasing both edges of the recorded pattern formed by the recording reproducing head 5 on the disc 1 , the recording reproducing head 5 and the erasing head or heads 6, 7 being positioned so that a diametrical line A A passing through the centre 11 of the disc 1 lies between a gap 8 of the recording reproducing head 5 and the gap 9, 10 of the erasing head or heads 6, 7 .
