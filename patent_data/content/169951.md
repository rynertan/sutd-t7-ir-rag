# System and apparatus for multi dimensional real time chromatography.

## Abstract
A column and detector are disclosed for two dimensional column chromatography of a sample, in which the sample is injected close to a corner of a thin parallele pipedal column through which percolates a first solvent pumped at a controlled velocity. After a convenient time this flow is stopped and a stream of a second solvent is pumped at a controlled velocity in the perpendicular direction. Elution of the separated components is performed, the stream exiting from the column flows over a detector which monitors its composition at a large number of points, along the exit edge allowing the derivation of a two dimensional chromatogram. The chromatographic bed can be hon ogeneous or made of a first portion including a first composition suitable to perform column chromatography in the first direction of the column and a second portion including a second composition suitable to perform column chromatography in a second direction of the column, wherein both compositions are selected from compositions available for column chromatography. A method for making a column and detector for three dimensional chromatogra phy is also disclosed. Methods for using such columns and detectors, over pressure development of conventionally read two dimensional thin column chromatograms, use of the thin layer column as a multicolumn chromatograph, injection of unknowns into the flowing solvent, optimum flow rates, and a special cuvette plate and associated apparatus for performing the methods are also disclosed.

## Description
TECHNICAL FIELD This application relates to multi dimensional multiphase chromatography employing real time detection. More particularly it relates to such chromatography employing fluid separation of an unknown s constituents, particularly thin layer chromatography, with at least the second dimensional, second phase, separation performed by continuous overpressured thin layer chromatography with novel real time multiple linear array detection means. The unknown is injected into the flowing stream. A three dimensional scheme according to the invention is also disclosed. Use of the two dimensional system employing real time quasi real time detection permits separation of as many as five hundred to one thousand components of an unknown depending on the size of the chromatographic plate and the use of data processing means to process the data and present it in convenient form. BACKGROUND ART The separation of complex mixtures is a task of major importance for the analyst and there are several fields now where considerable effort is made solving that kind of problems, in biochemical, clinical, environmental, food and petroleum chemistry especially Chromatography is by nature the most efficient separation method the analyst can use and is the backbone of all separation schemes devised. The supremacy of chromatography is a consequence of its important separation power and of the wide range of retention mechanisms which are available, most of them offering tunable selectivity by adjusting the composition of the mobile phase. It is rare, however, that the separation of a complex mixtures can be solved using one chromatographic column, either in isochratic or gradient conditions. The separation power of a chromatographic column is best expressed by its peak capacity, the number of peaks with resolution unity which are eluted between k 0 and a final value, usually 6.4 but rarely exceeding 10. The peak capacity of a conventional packed LC column can hardly exceed a few hundreds a hundred thousand plate column which is already a rarity, has a peak capacity between 160 k 6.4 and 240 k 20 . It has been shown that assuming aPoisson distribution of the kl of the compounds of the analyzed mixture in the range of k recorded, it cannot be used to separate much more than about 150 peaks and even for less complex mixtures a number of peaks will be multiplets, i.e. the corresponding compounds will interfere.Previous work has shown that there is little hope to increase much the peak capacity available beyond several hundreds, even by accepting very long analysis times and resorting to capillary columns of very small diameter less than 5 micrometers and meeting the exacting specifications their successful use demands. Accordingly, the analysis of complex mixtures is usually attempted by combinations of selective extractions and chromatographic separations. This is time consuming, tedious, and costly because of all the additional efforts to avoid the sources of errors due to contamination and losses.So called multi dimensional chromatography separates on a second column on fraction purified on a first column, but cannot be applied to the entire sample. An analytical scheme using several retention mechanisms integrated into a continuous series of operations applied to a sample in one single equipment would solve all these problems and simplify considerably the data handling, since all quantitative results would apply to the same sample. Two dimension thin layer chromatography TLC 2 operates on such a principle. In this method a plate is covered with silica gel. In single phase chromatography, an unknown is placed on the plate and the plate is placed in a beaker containing enough solvent to wet the lower edge of the plate. As the solvent climbs up the silica gel layer on the plate by capillary attraction, it moves the sample along with it. However, the different constituents of the sample having different affinities for the silica gel, are separated. The development is stopped when the first constituent reaches the top of the plate. The plate is dried. The constituents can be detected as spots at different positions on the silica gel.The silica gel may also be treated in various ways e.g., so that it is polar, in which case non polar solvents may be utilized or vice versa or it may be coated with certain molecules having specific affinities for the suspected unknowns. Thus the unknowns may be separated by their polar properties, by their molecular weights or by certain chemical affinities. The first separation using TLC was published 40 years ago by Consden, Gordon and Martin. They used a 55 x 45cm sheet of Whatman paper to separate alpha amino acids.The first development was made with a mixture of collidine and water. It lasted 72 hours. After drying, a second development using phenol water in an atmosphere containing coal gas and ammonia was carried out for another 48 hours.Detection was based on the ninhydrine reaction. At least 15 of the 22 proteinic amino acids were separated. Sample size was 200 micrograms of protein hydrolyzate and sensitivity 1 microgram. The spot capacity of the paper sheet can be estimated at slightly over 100. In two dimensional thin layer chromatography TLC 2 the chromatographic plate is coated in a strip along one edge with one form of treated or untreated silica gel and along the rest of the plate with a different form of treated or untreated silica gel. The plate is first developed along the strip by placing an edge perpendicular thereto into a beaker of appropriate solvent to separate the unknown into a linear array of constituents. After drying the plate is placed into another beaker of another solvent along the edge parallel to the linear array of constituents and they are developed up the plate to form a planar array of subconstituents. After drying, in order to analyze the plate, these sub constituents must be detected and their position on the plate, and density, measured either by eye or by automatic means. Such means are expensive, and due to the spread out nature of the spots of the sub constituents on the plate are not very accurate. Since there is no control of the speed of the solvent moving up the plate, reproduceability is not good. This greatly limits the efficacy of this system of analysis. In terms of quantitative analysis derived from density measurements results better than 10 to 20 accuracy are very difficult to obtain. Furthermore, the development of such thin layer chromatographic plates is time consuming, taking up to several hours in each direction. Recently however pressurized thin layer chromatography has come into use to try to avoid this time difficulty. In this system the solvent is forced through the thin layer of a retention medium by placing a cover plate over the thin layer of retention medium. This system has increased the speed of development. TLC 2 has developed slowly over the years. The number of publications where this technique is described or used exceeds 200, which is neither negligible nor very important.The major technological advances since the original paper have stemmed out from the progress in thin layer chromatography TLC technology. The major drawbacks of the technique are 1 the difficulties in making plates with a lateral strip of a stationary phase different from the one used for the main part of the plate which makes difficult the use of retention mechanisms based on different stationary phases 2 the cross contamination between the two developments, i.e. the retention pattern obtained during the second development is influenced by evaporation residuals of the first solvent and is different from the retention pattern obtained directly with the second solvent on the same stationary phase 3 the quadratic law of solvent front migration and the unfavorable relationship between the particle size and the kinetic coefficient of the plate, which prevents from using fine particles with moderately large plates and achieving large bed efficiency 4 the sample solution is applied on the dry bed and the solvent dried out this promotes strong selective or irreversible adsorption, clogs adsorbent particles with viscous or solid material slow to dissolve in the mobile phase, resulting in strong tailing 5 the near impossibility to achieve directly quantitative analysis. This last drawback is probably the most basic and the most serious. It is already difficult to scan a conventional TLC plate. The signal does not follow the Behr law but the more complex Kubelka Munk function. Sensitivity is moderate and the size of the scanner light beam is as large or larger than one spot standard deviation when it should be 5 times smaller. It cannot be reduced in size, however, because the noise due to the granular appearance of the surface would become too large. The compromise between sensitivity and contribution to band broadening cannot be made satisfactory.For this reason high resolution scanners such as those used for two dimensional gel electrophoresis with a spatial resolution of 0.lmm cannot be used with success in TLC 2 and a Vidicon Camera needs extensive digital filtering of the data, with all the difficulties associated with it. To solve most of these problems we combine TLC 2 with over pressured development. Over pressure development was suggested by Tyihak et al for conventional thin layer chromatography TLC . A plastic membrane is applied under pressure against the surface of the TLC plate, effectively sealing chromatographic bed between it and the plate support. The solvent can be pumped through the bed at the required velocity as long as the corresponding inlet pressure is smaller than the pressure applying the membrane.Originally invented for centrifugal TLC this technique has been extended to conventional linear TLC through the use of a distributor. This permits solving the third of the five problems discussed above. More recently a system quite similar to those previously mentioned has been designed with the aim of achieving conditions analogous to those prevailing in high pressure liquid chromatography HPLC so that retention data measured by TLC can be used without correction in column chromatography. A TLC plate is protected by a shield which does not touch it the end of the TIC plate protrudes out of this enclosure and is swept by a warm gas stream which vaporizes the solvent when it exits from under the shield.The plate is horizontal and the solvent phase is fed to it through a capillary siphon and a distributor. The relative positions of the plate, the tip of the siphon and the solvent tank prevents flooding the plate while supplying a sufficient amount of solvent to keep it normally wet. In these conditions a steady state is achieved and constant speed of the mobile phase is obtained. It is not possible to adjust it, however. The speed is approximately equal to what would be derived from the quadratic law, using for plate length the distance between the distributor and the front of mobile phase resulting from its vaporization. The sample is injected with a syringe, downstream of the distributor, after the steady flow of solvent is achieved.This eliminates the difficulties associated with demixing of solvent mixtures in conventional TLC. Excellent analytical results have been obtained with this system. Retention data compares very closely to those measured in column chromatography. Spot shape is considerably improved with drastic reduction of the tailing due to irreversible sorption by the dry adsorbent or slow dissolution of concentrated samples. A slightly modified version of this instrument has also been used to provide an elegant pilot technique for the optimization of preparative column chromatography. The method is very simple, provides reliable results, permits considerable solvent savings and is certainly a major advance in the art of TIC, but unfortunately it has not yet received the audience it deserves. Its drawbacks are the impossibility of adjusting the solvent velocity except by changing particule size or development length, i.e. separation power, and the lack of on line detection. Another system is identical to the above one as far as the chromatographic part is concerned, except for the use of a wick instead of a siphon to feed the plate with the solvent. There is a signficant addition to the earlier devices, however, in the use of a W photometer to detect the spots before they reach the exit wick. Thus a chromatogram is obtained similar to those given by an HPLC equipment, with little advantage beyond simplicity but the marked drawbacks of a flow velocity which cannot be adjusted, of a very short optical path length and a spot detection based on W absorption carried out on a porous diffusive medium. For these reasons we do not believe that this principle is more expedient than HPLC for routine analysis. The data published show that the resolution obtained with the new system is comparable to that achieved using the same TLC plate in a conventional manner On the other hand the reproducibility of retention times is markedly improved, as could reasonably be expected when a method using a steady state stream, like TCC, is compared to a method using a transient state stream like TIC, because of the complexities of the phenomena involved in TLC flow. A more sophisticated chromatographic system has been described by Tyihak and his associates. The basic principle is to cover the sorbent layer of a TLC system by a plastic membrane applied under an external pressure. The membrane fills the irregularities of the smooth layer surface and together with the layer support makes a porous sandwich analogous to a column through which solvent can be forced under pressure. With this technique called over pressureTLC which is indeed an actual kind of column chromatography using a column of non conventional cross section, the velocity of the mobile phase can be adjusted at will, by setting the solvent inlet pressure at the required value, as long as it is smaller than the external pressure applying the membrane on the sorbent layer.Originally the method was limited to circular, centrifugal development for obvious reasons of simplicity in the design, using a circular chamber with a solvent inlet at the center, but in a more advanced system the use of a distributor permits parallel development of a number of samples as in conventional TLC. Experimental data demonstrate that the distance travelled by the solvent is proportional to time and not given by the quadratic law anymore, that the flow velocity of the solvent can be adjusted independently of development distance and particule size, that the retention is highly reproducible and not significantly changed by the development distance, which is not true in conventional TIC, and that the plate height does not depend anymore on the migration distance since the solvent velocity is kept constant. We note in passing that the plate height achieved, which may not be the minimum, is approximately 15 micrometers with HPTLC particules and 33 micrometers with TLC particules leading to a value of the reduced plate height of about 2 2.5, in agreement with our independent estimates of the plate performances.The solvent velocity is 0.25 mm second in both cases, corresponding to a reduced velocity of about 1.8 in the first case and 3.5 in the second. These results are quite similar to those obtained in column chromatography. As a consequence the separation number obtained increases monotonically with solvent migration distance instead of going through a maximum smaller than 20 as it does in TIC. Needless to say, excellent analytical results are obtained. This excellent chromatographic bed design is very close to a column with a thin rectangular profile. Its major drawback is that it is operated by starting with a dry layer, placing the samples as inconventional TLC and after pressurizing the membrane, flowing the solvent stream into the dry layer. There is no need of operating this way, although it saves solvent. Better results, especially for weakly retained compounds may be obtained using on line injection after a steady solvent stream is established.Furthermore, this system suffers from a lack of on line detection. Finally, several groups have developed during these last few years a scheme to separate over a thousand different proteins and analyze them quantitatively using bi dimensional electuophoress, Although the separation mechanism is different from chromatography and the technological problems involved are not related, there is obviously a close relationship between the principles of the two techniques, TCC 2 and electrophoresis 2. Indeed, electrophoresis can be used for each separation mechanisms but the last in CC 2, CC or TCC 2 The software used for data acquisition and handling is also quite similar. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION In our invention a column which, for sake of convenience will be assumed to be square but does not need to be, is packed either entirely or almost completely with a stationary phase of conventional retention media used in high performance liquid chromatography HptC . This may be, for example, plain silica, reversed phase material, size exclusion material, ion exchange resin, etc. In some cases a narrow strip along one side of the column is packed with a different material of identical size. A first solvent is pumped in the direction parallel to that strip after a steady stream is achieved the sample is injected near the far corner of the column and one column volume is pumped or more if the first compounds of interest are retained on this first chromatographic separation.After the flow of this first solvent is stopped, a second solvent is pumped in the perpendicular direction and the sample components are eluted out of the column and carried through a detector unit which is the equivalent of a large array of conventional HPLC detectors parallel to the exit edge of the plate. The separated peaks can be reconstructed from the detector signals as a three dimensional plot of concentration versus time and abscissa along the exit edge. The two chromatographic systems must fulfill two conditions I they must give retention patterns widely different for the components of the analyzed mixture, e.g.one separates by molecular size, the other by polarity and or polarizability 2 they must be compatible in the sense that the first solvent should not destroy the second adsorbent and should be either miscible with the second solvent or easy to get rid of. This can be achieved by pumping an inert gas in the second direction or a third solvent, miscible to both the first and second and of small elution strength in the second direction. This method which we call two dimensional column chromatography CC is a method which combines the advantages of column chromatography constant, adjustable flow velocity, excellent efficiency, on line detection on solution and two dimensional thin layer chromatography successive developments in two perpendicular directions, using two different retention mechanisms . By merely keeping constant the solvent flow velocity during the development of a TLC plate, a considerable increase in the spot capacity can be achieved, since plate length and particule size can be selected now without any prejudicial influence on the solvent velocity which can be kept constant at the value considered as optimum by the analyst. Calculations show that CC 2 can generate peak capacities well in excess of 500, up to several thousands, and that the specifications for the equipment are not drastic.A 10 x 10cm column would be lmm thick, be well packed with 10 micrometer particles and be operated at a reduced velocity of 10. Such a packing could be expected to be very homogeneous A 0.7 and the reduced plate height would be 1.95. The expected spot capacity is 900, while the pressure drop for a compound with D 5 x 10 6 cm2 s u 0.05 cm s and a solvent with viscosity 1 cP is only 5 atm flow rate 3 3 cm min . The sample spot should be about lmin diameter or less. In the system and apparatus described, an unknown mixture is placed at one end of a strip of material utilizing a first retention mechanism and an appropriate solvent is forced through the strip which is placed under a cover plate so that the solvent is eluted out the other end of the strip until a first constituent reaches the end of the strip at which time the elution is stopped. Adjacent to the first strip is a two dimensional thin layer of material having a second retention mechanism. The layer and strip which may be on a single plate are then placed under a cover plate and the appropriate solvent for the second retention mechanism is forced across the strip orthogonal to the array of constituents and eluted out the other side of the plate opposite the strip. A vacuum device may be attached to the eluting edge to aid in this process.The plate is either supplied with a transparent slit at the edge of the plate or a transparent slit is provided adjacent the edge through which the solvent elutes in a laminar fashion. In one embodiment of the invention the slit is illuminated with ultraviolet light and a multi photo diode linear array on the other side of the slit detects the ultraviolet light.When a sub constituent passes through the slit, it is detected by the diode array. The time and position of the detection is an indication of the nature of the subconstituent and the amount of absorption is an indication of the quantity of the sub constituent. The output from the diode array may be recorded on magnetic tape and processed by a computer in order to provide a pseudo three dimensional plot or cathode ray display in the form of mountain peaks of the sub constituents arrayed on a two dimensional flat plate. The position of the peaks indicates the nature of the constituent, and the volume of the mountain the quantity of the constituent. Alternatively, the computer may be programmed to provide a list of the components and their quantities. Alternatively, a fast computer with a large memory can be used to process the output of the detector in real time. Thus, we use a two dimensional column, eluted successively along the two perpendicular directions. The column is identical to the thin, two dimensional layer used in two dimensional TLC TLC ê but is used differently. The sample is introduced in a corner of the plate as in TLCê but instead of relaying on capillarity and surface tension of solvents to develop the chromatogram, the layer is pressurized and a conventional HPLC pump is used to force a stream of solvent across the column, parallel to one of its dimensions first, until the less retained compounds of interest migrate close to the plate edge opposite to the sample introduction see FIGURE 1 . This first, forced development achieved, a second solvent stream is pumped in the perpendicular direction.It is possible to stop this second development when the fastest compounds of interest reach the opposite edge. The two dimensional chromatogram is then read conventionally. Then the only advantage over TLC 2 is that the flow velocity of both solvents is controlled during the entire process, permitting the choice of an optimum velocity, irrespective of the particule size of the stationary phase and of the viscosity, surface tension or contact angle of the mobile phase. This velocity can be maintained constant whatever the column length and the sample can be applied after an equilibrium is reached between the first solvent and the adsorbent, thus offering more reproducible retention data. We call this procedure two dimensional thin column chromatography or TCC 2 to distinguish it from TLC . Another, more powerful, aspect of our invention is to elute the compounds out of the bed of stationary phase and detect them on line, as in EPLC. The cross section of the fluid at the column outlet is a thin, long rectangle. This stream flows over a diode array aligned along the column exit slit and is irradiated by an appropriate W light beam,Alternatively a flying spot or a Vidicon can be used. Thus the local changes of absorption of the mobile phase when spots are eluted can be monitored and recorded using the signals collected from the hundreds of pixels of the diode array. An x, t, c two dimension chromatogram can thus be obtained. It takes more time to record it than to develop a TCC 2 chromatogram but quantitative data are available right away, whereas the TCC 2 chromatogram remains to be scanned.We call this procedure two dimensional column chromatography or CC 2. Obviously the same principles can be used to carry out three dimensional separations using CC 3. Although this separation scheme is new, the idea to control and adjust the flow velocity in TLC is not and definitive progress along this line have been made recently.Brenner and Niederwieser were probably the first to suggest the use of a simple device that forces solvent to run over, thus providing a steady mobile phase velocity for the development of a thin layer plate. They were interested merely in overdevelopment, however, as were Hara and Mibe and many others like Snyder. The advantages of having a steady stream of solvent flowing along the thin layer bed are essentially the measurement of more reproducible retention data, of retention data which match closely those obtained in column chromatography, the use of a constant velocity and constant plate height for a given compound during the development, possibility to optimize analysis time and separation by adjusting separately the development length and the particule size, the possibility to detect spots during their migration by light absorption or reflexion.If in addition the thin layer bed is enclosed and the solvent can be forced through it, two additional advantages are the possibility to adjust the flow velocity to an optimum value independently of the development length and particule size and on line detection on the bulk solvent down stream the column exit, without interference from the diffusive stationary phase medium. In a three dimensional form of the apparatus, the second dimensional development is ceased when the first subconstituent reaches the edge of the plate. The plate is permeable and when dried, is placed against a cube of a material having a third retention mechanism and a third solvent is forced through the plate and through the cube. A vacuum device at the opposite side of the cube aids in the elution. Detection is effective through a transparent place in the cube by tomagraphic means or a multiple array planar detector. As discussed in the introduction the resolution power of a chromatographic technique is better defined by the number of components which can be resolved from its neighbors with a resolution unity and the time requested.Conventional column chromatography has a peak capacity which in current practice cannot exceed 150 200 and in exceptional cases 500. This last performance would require the equivalent of a million theoretical plates, well beyond reach even using the best capillary columns we may dream of. The spot capacity of TLC is in practice limited to about 30. To achieve better capacity would require the use of very long plates with prohibitively long development times and large tanks.In over pressure TLC the spot capacity becomes comparable to that achieved in column chromatography CC only the available pressure drop limited by the maximum allowable over pressure and the length are really limiting the capacity, much as in CC, With the 30cm long plates used by Tyihak et al a spot capacity of about 80 is a practical maximum particule size 5 micrometers, h 2 pressure 36 atm . On the other hand TLC 2 offers a spot capacity of about 300 without any major difficulty a 10 x 10cm plate made with 15 micrometer particles will do and the total development time is around 30 min. with most solvent combinations. It becomes extremely difficult to reach a capacity of 500, however, again because of the problems associated with the quadratic law of solvent front migration. One should force the solvent through the chromatographic bed and not trust capillary forces to do it. When the two dimension chromatographic bed is operated according to our invention, the peak capacity is again markedly increased. Scanning a range of k extending from 0 to 10, one can, in principle, achieve a peak capacity of 750 with a 10 x 10cm column packed with 10 micrometer particles, with a packing quality comparable to that of good CC columns. As it is easier to pack a homogeneous thin layer than a homogeneous cylinder a better peak capacity, up to about 900 could be achieved. This column has to be operated at a relatively large reduced velocity 9 about 10 so the lateral spreading of the spots is reduced markedly in a trading with increased axial broadening.With a typical compound with a diffusion coefficient of 5 x 10 6 cm2 s and a solvent of viscosity lcP, the actual solvent velocity is 0.05 cm s, the inlet pressure 5 atm and the breakthrough time 200 s. Total analysis time to in the first direction and 11 to in the second one to scan k from 0 to 10 is 40 min. The bursting force on the column wall is 500 kg. Much better performances can be achieved using a very well packed A 0.70 column, 15 x 15cm made with 3 micrometer particles. This provides a capacity of 4600 peaks, with a total analysis time of 18 min. with an inlet pressure of 280 atm, so the over pressure bursting force in the equipment is at least 63 tons. Accordingly the practical limit in peak capacity of CC 2 is a few thousands, about 10 times larger than eitherCC or TLC 2. Those skilled in the art will understand that many different retention mechanisms may be utilized, chosen for their respective appropriateness to the unknown being analyzed. Furthermore, many different detectors may be employed, such optical detectors for detecting changes in the index of refraction, polarization rotation and the like. If the materials being analyzed are radioactive or are made radioactive, radiation detectors may be employed. Fluorescence detectors and detectors of any appropriate physical phenomena, such as hot wire or flame detectors, may be utilized. The invention also contemplates that one or more of the separation steps may be carried out with a gas rather than a liquid. Thus the first step could be carried out by gas chromatography until the first constituent reached the edge of the packed linear column and the second orthogonal step carried out by eluting a gas through the two dimensional plate like column. Liquid and gas chromatography could be used alternatively, either one first.Fluid is used herein to mean liquid or gas Each dimensional separation except the last can be carried out using conventional thin layer chromatography without over pressure the last dimensional separation utilizing over pressured fluid gas or liquid chromatography with a real time multiple linear array detector in the case of two dimensional chromatography or a real time multiple planar array or tomagraphic detector in the case of three dimensional chromatography . Similarly, each dimensional separation except the last can be carried out using electrophoresis or any other chromatographic separation process.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS For a fuller understanding of the nature and objects of the invention reference should be had to the following detailed description taken in connection with the accompanying drawing in which FIGURE 1 is a top plan view of a two dimensional thin layer chromatographic plate utilized in the invention FIGURE 2 is a diagrammatic view of over pressured elution apparatus and real time detection means utilized in the system and apparatus of the invention FIGURE 3 is a diagrammatic view of a system and apparatus for automatic three dimensional chromatography according to the invention FIGURE 4 is a plan view of apparatus for performing two dimensional column chromatography, two dimensional thin column chromatography and multi sample thin column chromatography according to the invention FIGURE 5 is a bottom view of a portion of the apparatus of FIGURE 4 FIGURE 6 is a cross sectional diagrammatic view taken along the line 6 6 of FIGURE 4 FIGURE 7 is a cross sectional view taken along the line 6 6 of FIGURE 4 FIGURE 8 is a cross sectional view taken along the line 8 8 of FIGURE 4 FIGURES 9 through 14 are planar diagrammatic views of a two dimensional chromatographic plate illustrating spot migration and growth FIGURE 15 is a plot of variation of the spot capacity in two dimensional thin column chromatography against the standard deviation of the sample spot FIGURE 16 is a plot of the peak capacity in two dimensional column chromatography versus the value of k at which the analysis is stopped FIGURE 17 is a plot of the peak capacity in two dimensional column chromatography against the reduced velocity FIGURE 18 is a plot of the peak capacity in two dimensional column chromatography versus the value of the constants A and C FIGURE 19 is a plot of the peak capacity in three dimensional column chromatography versus the reduced velocity FIGURE 20 is a plot of the peak capacity in three dimensional column chromatography versis the value of k at which the analysis is stopped and FIGURE 21 is a schematic block diagram of a data acquisition and processing system according to our invention. The same reference characters refer to the same elements throughout the several views of the drawing. BEST MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION Now referring to FIGURE 1, a conventional twodimensional bi phase chromatographic plate 20 used in the invention may comprise a glass plate of which a first band or strip 22 of plain silica gel is affixed, the remaining portion of the plate 24 is also covered with silica gel however, this has been treated to react to the OH groups bonded to the silica with octadecyl C18 alkyl groups.Thus, the strip 22 has a normal silica surface which is highly polar, and it interacts with components of the unknown by means of their polar groups. The surface 24 is alkyl bonded silica which is poorly wetted by water, nonpolar, and interacts essentially with the alkyl or carbon skeleton of the molecule. The unknown 26 is placed at one end of the strip 22 and the edge 28 may be wetted by an appropriate non polar or moderately polar solvent, like heptane or chloroform. The constituents of the unknown 26 will thus differentially move along the strip 22 and be separated into the constituents indicated by the dotted spots 30. When a dotted spot has reached edge 32 of plate 20 the development is stopped and the plate dried. Now referring to FIGURE 2, the plate 20 is then inserted into apparatus for over pressured development. A cover plate 34 is provided in contact with the silica gel 24 and 22. An appropriate solvent 36 for the retention mechanism of the alkyl bonded silica gel 24, such as water, methanol, acetonitrile, or mixtures thereof, is supplied from reservoir 38 to a pump 40 and from the pump 40 to a plenum chamber 42 which forces the solvent 36 through the strip 22 and the thin plate like column of silica gel 24. The pressure in the plenum may be several up to at least 15 atmospheres. A second plenum 44 at the edge 46 of plate 20 may be connected to a vacuum pump 48 to aid in the elution of the solvent 36 through the planar column of FIGURE 2.The solvents mentioned will move at an average rate of about one millimeter per second under these conditions. Now referring to FIGURE 1, a strip 50 at edge 46 of plate 20 is preferably not covered with silica gel 24 and the plate is preferably of glass or quartz. This allows detection of the eluting components in FIGURE 2 by passing light through the glass or quartz cover plate 34 and through the transparent strip 50 of plate 20. Light source 52 illuminates the eluting solvent 36 and components of the unknown and this is detected by detector 54 which may be a linear multi photo diode array. Since these arrays come in lengths of about 2 1 2 centimeters, and the conventional plates 20 are approximately 10 centimeters on an edge, an optical system not shown may be utilized to focus the image of the strip 50 onto the detector 54. The detector, which may have several thousand diodes, is connected to an analog to digital converter and commutator 58 which converts the outputs of each of the diodes to digital form and supplies them at frequent intervals, for example, ten times per second, to a multi channel tape recorder 60. The rate at which the output of the diode array 54 is recorded by the tape recorder 60 depends of course upon the speed of elution of the solvent 36 and the components of the unknown. Under the conditions stated above each constituent peak is a spot 0.5 to 3 millimeters in diameter.It is preferred that this be fast enough so that a large enough number of readings of the rise and fall of the peak of each component being eluted is recorded so that an integration may be performed of the total size of the peak, thus giving an accurate indication of the quantity of the component. The literally millions of individual measurements recorded on the magnetic tape 60 are then supplied to a large digital computer 62 which converts data either to a pseudo three dimensional plot which simulates the components as mountain peaks on a two dimensional plate, or a listing of components derived from previous test measurements with the quantity of each found, or to a two dimensional chromatogram similar to a developed bi phase plate. Each side of the plate 20 of FIGURE 1 may be 5 to 20 centimeters long and the silica gel, layers 22 and 24 thereon, may be l lOth to one millimeter thick. The plate 20 is thus conventional except for the transparent strip 50 along the top edge 46 thereof. When no such strip is provided the apparatus of FIGURE 2 may be provided with its own window as indicated at the dotted line 64. The first development of the components 30 along the strip 22 may be performed as described by conventional thin layer chromatography, or the apparatus illustrated inFIGURE 2 may be used, in which case an appropriate solvent 36 is forced into the edge 28 perpendicular to the strip 22 and the development continues until the first component is detected by the detector 54. The development is then stopped. The plate dried. Then the plate is again placed into the apparatus of FIGURE 2 with the lower edge 66 in the plenum 22. It will be understood that the edges of the plate 20 and the cover plate 34, not within the plenum 42 or plenum 44, are sealed to prevent leaks. The apparatus of FIGURE 2 may be thought of as many intercommunicating parallel chromatographic columns and in fact, the solvent 36 need not be a liquid, but could be a gas and the apparatus of FIGURE 2 could operate by gas chromatography. The light source 52 may be ultraviolet at 254 nanometers, in which case plate 34 and window 50 are quartz.Alternatively, there may be a plurality of light sources which are successively illuminated, such as 254, 280 and 350 nanometers, these wave lengths being chosen to be specifically absorbed by the unknown constituents being sought. The measurements at the three different wave lengths can then be utilized to make three superimposed plots on a TV screen1 each in a different primary color. In this way constituents of an unknown mixture may be recognized by their colors in the three color presentation of the chromatogram. Those skilled in the art will understand that the retention media 22 and 24 need not be conventional thinlayer chromatographic retention media in the apparatus ofFIGURE 2, but may be any kind of stationary phase used in liquid chromatography, as for example gels used for gel or size exclusion chromatography. Also, other means such as the application of electrical fields as used in electrophoresis, to induce separation of components of a mixture, may also be employed. Furthermore, if gas chromatography is utilized, any of the well known packing materials utilized in packed gas chromatographic columns may be employed. Many different forms of detection may be utilized in the apparatus of FIGURE 2 other than the straight densometry mentioned above. Conventional means may be employed for detecting the index of refraction of the eluting mixture.If the components fluoresce, fluorescence detection may be employed. The components may be radioactive or may be tagged with radioactive molecules, such as in various radioassay techniques, and the detector 54 may be a radioactivity detector. The components may be ions and the detector 54 may be an electro chemical detector. If the moving phase medium 36 is a gas, various detectors used in gas chromatography may be used, such as flame detectors or hot wire detectors. Those skilled in the art will see that we have provided a method of greatly increasing the number of constituents which may be separated from an unknown mixture in less time and with a real time output capable of being analyzed by data processing techniques. Depending on the size of plate and size of particles used to pack the column as well as packing qualities, the number of components that may be separated from a mixture according to the apparatus of FIGURE 2 may be as high as five hundred to more than one thousand in a single two phased chromatographic analysis. The system and apparatus of our invention may be generalized to three dimensions as illustrated in FIGURE 3.There the chromatographic plate 20 is not made of glass but of a completely porous substance. After being developed in the second dimension that orthogonal to the strip 22 until the first component reaches the detector 54 development is stopped and the plate 20 is dried. It is then placed against a cube 66 of a stationary phase of a third retention mechanism and then appropriate moving phase 68 for that retention mechanism is pumped from reservoir 69 by pump 70 through plenum chamber 72 into one face of the cube 66 and thence through the cube 66 in the direction of the arrow to the opposite face of the cube 66 and into an evacuation plenum 74 and vacuum pump 76. Of course the other faces of the cube are sealed by means not shown. Detection of the exiting components in a plane perpendicular to the arrow may be accomplished by a tomagraphic detector comprising a light source 78 rotating in the plane with detector 80. Information is fed to an analog to digital converter commutator 82 and then to magnetic tape recorder 84 and thence may be analyzed by a digital computer 86 in the same manner utilizing the same tomagraphic equations presently used in medical tomagraphy.Alternatively, a planar array detector may be incorporated into the plenum 74. Utilizing the apparatus illustrated in FIGURE 3, as many as ten thousand components may be separated from a single unknown by a single three dimensional chromatographic analysis. More particularly and referring to FIGURES 4, 5, and 6, preferred apparatus for over pressure two dimensional thin column chromatography TCC 2 two dimensional over pressure 2 continuous column chromatography CC and over pressure multi sample thin column chromatography MTCC comprises a steel cuvette 102. This may be 15cm square and 5cm thick.A 10cm square, lmm deep, cavity 100 is machined in the block 102. It is filled with a slurry of the particles chosen for the chromatographic bed, suspended in an appropriate solvent. A slight excess of the slurry is used and when it is settled sufficiently, but before the solvent has evaporated, the excess is scraped off by passing a microtome blade over the block 102. The bed is dried in an oven and placed in a hood. The block 102 also has machined in it four lmm wide, lmm deep, 10cm long, grooves 104, 106, 108, and 110, each located 3mm from and parallel to one of the edges of the cavity 100. Groove 104 is connected to a solvent supply comprising a reservoir 111, pump 112, and valve 113. Groove 110 is connected to a solvent supply comprising pump 114, valve 115, and solvent reservoir 117. Groove 104 is connected at its opposite ends through valve 105 to a collection reservoir 107. Thus groove 104 may be purged by opening valves 105 and 113 and turning on pump 112. Groove 110 may be similarly purged by using valve 119 and collection reservoir 121. Thus grooves 104 and 110 are the supply grooves for the apparatus. Grooves 106 and 108 are the collection grooves. Groove 106 is connected through valve 121 to collection reservoir 123 and through valve 125 through suction pump 127 to collection reservoir 129. Similarly collection groove 108 is connected through valve 131 to collection reservoir 133 and through valve 135 via suction pump 137 to collection reservoir 139. Thus collection grooves 106 and 108 may be drained, subject only to the pressure of the eluting fluid through valves 121 and 131 respectively, or negative pressure may be applied to grooves 106 and 108 by means of the suction pumps 127 and 137 respectively. Pumps 112 and 114 are conventional Waters 6000A HPDC pumps, manufactured by Waters Associates, Milford,Massachusetts. Referring now to FIGURE 6, a thin sheet 116 of mylar or other flexible material resistant to the solvent used, is placed over the steel block 102 and a 15 x 15 x 5cm block 118 of plexiglass is tightly pressed against block 102 using seven bolts not shown . Referring to FIGURE 5, the face of the plexiglass block 118 pressed against the mylar sheet 116 is machined.Central cavity 120 is 9.8 x 9.8cm. Grooves 122, 124, 126, and 128 are 5mm wide, each parallel to a side of the central cavity 120 and spaced about lmm from it. Cavity 120 and grooves 122, 124, 126, and 128 are about 2mm deep and are connected via channels 134, 136, 138, 140, and 142 to a source of water under pressure 130 FIGURE 6 fed by water pump 132. The water under pressure is fed via five valves, only three, 144, 146, and 148 are shown to the five cavities in the plexiglass block 118. The five cavities are also connected to vacuum line 150 via five valves, only three valves 152, 154, and 156 are shown . Referring particularly to FIGURE 6, in performing the first separation, valve 144 would be open to supply water under pressure to cavity 120, firmly pressing the mylar sheet against the separation medium 158. Valve 154 would be closed. Valves 146 and 148 would be closed, and valves 152 and 156 opened, applying vacuum to grooves 124 and 128. Now referring to FIGURE 7, this causes the mylar above grooves 110 and 106 to lift up, providing a connecting path between the grooves 110 and 106, and the medium 158. The corresponding valves to grooves 104 and 108 would be in their opposite state such that water under pressure would be applied to those grooves closing off any path between the medium 158 and those grooves. Now referring to FIGURE 8, a sampling port 162 is provided in the plexiglass block 118. It is terminated with a septum 164 such that a hypodermic needle 166 may be inserted therethrough to inject a sample into the medium 158 after the solvent is flowing through it. The solvent flow is continued until the first constituent of interest reaches the opposite edge of cavity 120. The solvent flow is then terminated. For the second separation, water is applied under pressure to grooves 124 and 128 and vacuum is applied to grooves 122 and 126. Solvent is then pumped through the medium 158 from groove 104 to groove 108. As shown in FIGURE 8, groove 108 is provided with a tortuous sheet like exit path generally indicated at 164 such that the solvent continues to flow in a laminar fashion and in a downward path at 166. Quartz windows 168 and 170 are provided at the opposite ends of path 166. Similarly a slot 1i2 is provided above quartz window 168 so that light may pass through slot 172, quartz windows 168 and 170, and flow path 166 for detection of the eluting constituents. This system is very simple, leak proof up to 8 to 10 atmospheres, reliable and provides excellent results. The bed efficiency is excellent, with reduced efficiency as low as 2. Even with a columm thickness of lmm there appears to be no significant radial gradient of flow velocity except at pressures very close to the over pressure provided by the water. The flow profile is nearly constant across the column except within a few millimeters from the edges. We prefer to locate the port 166 about lem from the edges of cavity 120 to avoid perturbations in the flow velocity along the column edge. Once injected the sample spot should have a diameter smaller than 1.2mm to minimize its contribution to the final spot size. An ultraviolet monochromatic light beam at 254 nanometers is provided by a powerful mercury lamp, a large parabolic mirror and a 9cm x 0.5mm slit not shown . This parallel beam is focused through slot 172, quartz windows 168 and 170, the flowing stream 166, onto a 1 inch long 1024Pixel array detector not shown supplied by Redicon ofSunnyvale, California. This is the equivalent of 1024 conventional ultraviolet detectors used in chromatography with a lmm optical path length. The lens has a 1 meter focal length and the system provides a definition of 1 pixel over most of the slit, 2 pixels at the very edge that is, 0.09 and 0.17mm respectively. At the beginning of elution, the standard deviation of the spots at the column exit is usually around 1.5mm. Thus, 10 data points are provided per each standard deviation at the beginning of elution.As the elution progresses, the spots get wider and the density of data points increases. The diode array is scanned 10 times per second at a flow velocity of 0.05cm per second, this provides 30 data points per standard deviation at k 0 and many more at k 10. The measurements can be added in groups of three at first and then more to improve the signal to noise ratio. AHewlett Packard model 21MX supplied by Hewlett Packard, PaloAlto, California, corrects the signals of each individual pixel for base current response. The data may then be recorded on magnetic tape or immediately processed by computer to provide a real time visual display. Alternatively, the eluting output of the second development can be scanned through slot 172 FIGURE 8 by means of a scanning ultraviolet beam and a single detector or a scanning Vidicon may be used in place of the diode array. The processing of the output of the diode array, the flying spot scanner or the Vidicon is done in the same way that electrophoretic chromatograms are scanned in the prior art to provide enhanced visual displays. The apparatus illustrated in FIGURES 4 8 may also be used as a multi column chromatograph for many samples.Referring to FIGURE 4, in this case solvent flow is provided from groove 104 to groove 108 and many individual samples are injected through many sampling ports similar to sampling port 162, arrayed in a line parallel to groove 104 and spaced about lcm from the edge of cavity 120 adjacent to groove 104. The apparatus may also be used to over pressure develop two dimensional chromatograms which are read in a conventional fashion by stopping the second development when the first spot of interest reaches the edge of cavity 100 adjacent output groove 108. The advantages over the prior art are achieved by injecting the unknown after solvent flow is established in the first development and by over pressure development in both directions.Signal Acquisition and Processing After elution through the column, the liquid phase passes through slit 166 FIGURE 8 which may be l lOth mm thick, 10cm long and 5mm deep. This is the detector cell in which the effluent flows steadily. The dimensions of the slit and the geometry of the exit line are designed to minimize turbulence in the liquid so as to obtain a curtain flow such that the spot broadening by remixing of the liquid is negligible. A monochromatic ultraviolet light source at, for example, 254 nanometers illuminates the cell 166 and the transmitted light falls on a monolithic self scanning charge coupled device photo diode array. This off the shelf item consists of a row of silicon photo diode each with an associated storage capacitor on which to integrate photo current and a multiplex switch for periodic readout by an integrated shift register scanning circuit. The array we use available from Reticon of Sunnyvale,California has 1,024 elements pixels , each cell consists of a photo diode and a dummy diode, both with an associated storage capacitor. These diodes are connected through multiplex switches to video and dummy recharge lines common to all cells. The scanning circuit is driven by a single phase clock with a start pulse to initiate the scan. The clock frequency defines the cell to cell rate. The time interval between two scans is defined by the time elapsed between two start pulses. The charges stored on each photo diode is gradually removed by photo current during the line time.The photo current is the product of the line sensitivity and the irradiance. The total charge removed from each cell is the product of the photo current and the line time. This charge is sent through the video line when the diode is sampled and reset once each scan. Now referring to FIGURE 21, the charge couple diode array is shown at 180 the clock lines at 182 and the video signal line at 184. They are connected to a computer processing unit generally indicated at 186. A video console generally indicated at 188 is connected to the processor 186 via an IEEE488 line 190. Mass storage devices such as a cassette recorder 192 or a diskette unit 194 may be connected to the video terminal 188. As the liquid flows through the slit, its local composition in the detector cell 166 FIGURE 8 varies as time elapses. It is necessary to correctly represent the elution of the spots to get the same temporal resolution as they pass by as spatial resolution if the elution were stopped and they were read conventionally. The 1024 pixels are arranged in the optical system such that they look at 50 micrometers along the length of the cell 166 which provides 20 sampling data points per millimeter. When the flow of the liquid through the slit is optimized to provide maximum separation of the different constituents as discussed below in the section THEORY, it is necessary to perform one scan every l lOth of a second. A complete separation can take about 15 minutes, approximately 1,000 seconds. This will thus require about 1,000 scans at 10 Hertz. The quantity of data to be stored is thus about 10 million values. Because of the above constraints, the interfacing and data acquisition system must be very fast as it must convert and read one scan and then process and store or visualize it in less than 100 milliseconds. The system discussed below is able to meet these requirements and even would provide for faster data acquisition, for background correction, diode callibration, signal filtering, and all functions commonly used in any data acquisition unit. The video signal has to be amplified, filtered and processed and the information must be stored. Again referring to FIGURE 21, the system we provide has a microprocessor 196 which manages all of the functions required for a given application. The microprocessor 196 can be activated by the terminal 188 via the IEEE488 bus 190. The terminal 188 performs the function of cross assembling the microprocessor programs, loading the programs into the system microprocessor 196 for a given sequence and entering data for the program to be run, e.g.start, sampling rate, sensitivity, gain, etc. . Such a system exists in the prior art using a CBM3032 or aTektronics 404A or a Hewlett Packard 21MX computer. The signal from the diode array 180 travels through the video line 184, interface and A to D conversion unit 198, differentially amplifies the video pulses to a usable voltage level. After the multiplex switch in the CCD180 is closed to sample the next diode, the voltage change on the video line 184 is sensed through a buffer amplifier in the interface and A to D conversion unit 198, sampled and held.The result is a boxcar shaped video signal which presents a differential current amplified signal which has the advantage of being an integrated signal and thus more easy to read and less noise sensitive. The signal is then digitized through an analog to digital converter, for example, a TRW PDC 1007J. The conversion time of this unit for one word is 200 nanoseconds. The total photo diode array signal or spectrum is thus converted on about 200 microseconds.Thus nearly all of the 100 milliseconds between two scans is available for real time processing or data transfer of each spectrum. All of the above is carried out in the interface and A to D conversion unit 198 through which signals from the microprocessor 196 and the diode array 180 are transmitted, synchronized, made compatible and transferred. The signal is then supplied to a stand alone CAMAC acquisition and data processing unit LeCroy ResearchSystems, Spring Valley, New York which can be operated as an intelligent sub system of a main data acquisition system performing monitoring, callibration, diagnostic, data sampling and display functions independent of the main system. The CAMAC samples the input signal every 50 nanoseconds, digitalizing and storing up to 1,024 successive samples which a resolution of 8 bits. The CAMAC may be operated from an external or internal clock. 4K words of instruction memory together with 4K words of data memory are available to the microprocessor. The CAMAC is generally indicated at 202, its power supply at 200. The CAMAC 202 comprises an interface for a color terminal with a 512 x 512 screen resolution. The data display 204 connected to the interface via cable 206 is preferably a CDCT 3151 BARCO monitor. The interface was developed in France D.E.I.N. CEN. SACLAY . It includes a dynamic memory of 250K words of 4 bits in which the image to be visualized is constituted point by point. The contents of the memory is continuously read and transferred via video line 206 to the color monitor 204 together with the image and line synchronization signals. By means of this system there can be displayed up to 50.5 images per second in the interlaced mode which thus displays the whole screen in about 12 seconds. The interface is totally programmable from the microprocessor of the CAMAC 202. The dimensions of the screen may be either 37 x 37cm or 51 x 51cm. The system also has the ability to provide hard copy. 16K of auxiliary memory 208 may also be utilized by the CAMAC 202. After the signal has been processed several functions are available. The CAB CAMAC module can perform background subtraction, peak recognition, data compresison and the like. The data can then be stored either on magnetic tapes or discs depending on the terminal 188 used to activate the system and also the quantity of information to be stored. This system has the advantages of speed of acquisition, capability of data processing, flexibility and ease of programming.

We shall calculate the spot or peak capacity in two 2 cases, in TCC 2 where development is stopped after one column volume has been pumped through the system successively in both directions and in CC 2 when one column volume is pumped through the system in the first direction and then elution is carried out in the second direction as in classical column chromatography. Calculations will also be made in the case of TCC 3 and CC 3. Let O1 I and L2 be the two dimensions of the column used, which does not need to be square, H1 and H2 the plate heights in the two directions, a. the standard deviation of the sample spot 2,3 , n1 and n2 the spot or peak capacities in the two directions, 2n and 3n the spot capacities we are looking for in two and three dimension analysis respectively H1 and H2 will be very close to each other as the same particle must be used to make the entire column, otherwise a systematic transcolumn variation of the flow velocity occurs, twists the spot trajectories and leads to poor results.The reduced plate heights h1 and h2 could be expected to be similar since in both directions we have assumed them to be constant, i.e. we have assumed that molecular diffusion and packing heterogeneity controls the plate height as in HPLC. As we work at optimum velocity, h for two very similar packings will be very close. We shall use the law of variance addition to calculate the spot size after its migrations see Figs. 9 14 . After the first development is over, a spot which has migrated a distance z becomes ovoid. Its variance in the axial direction is 1ê,a iê Z H1 1 while in the radial direction, i.e. in the second direction it is 2 2 2 l,r a. 2 y Dltl where t, is the development time in the first direction. In equation 2 we neglect the contribution to lateral dispersion due to anastomosis or stream splitting, which is approximated by 0.15 dpz. This contribution is small compared to the other two in the RHS of equation 2 at the flow velocities of interest in the present study. During the second development or the elution along the second direction, the spot variance in the axial direction is 2ê,a iê 2 D1t1 yH2 3 Since the initial variance of the spot, before migration in the second direction begins, is given by equation 2. This neglects the narrowing effect on a zone which enters a chromatographic bed in which it is retained, whose length is reduced in proportion to Rf Thus the spot capacity in TCC 2 will be somewhat underestimated, but not the peak capacity of CC 2 as the bands which leave the column are expanded at elution in the same ratio.Similarly the spot variance in the radial direction, i.e. the direction 1, becomes after the second elution a2 a z H1 2 y Dzt2 4 a, bi Since their variance at the beginning of their migration along the second direction was given by equation 1 and they expand radially by diffusion.

Combination of equation 3, 4 and 8 gives EMI42.3 Since ul, u2, H1, H2 are constants, integration of equation 9 is easy. The integration limits are 0 and L1 for z, O and L2 for Y We obtain EMI42.4 In the particular case where a. is negligible and the plate characteristics in both directions H,D,L,u can be considered as equal, equation 10 simplifies to EMI42.5 underestimated, but not the peak capacity of CC 2 as the bands which leave the column are expanded at elution in the same ratio.

But since N decreases with increasing solvent velocity there is clearly an optimum. It is obtained by eliminating N from equation 13 and searching the value of which makes equal to 0 the derivative of n by respect to9 EMI44.3 with EMI44.4 The solution is obtained by a numerical procedure. In many cases a square plate will be used, with very similar properties in both directions, but the sample spot, will not have a negligibly small dimension. Then equation 10 simplifies to EMI44.5 Equation 16 shows that the sample spot will not contribute markedly to a decrease of the plate performance as long as axis small compared to Ld 20 Spot capacity in TLC It is very easy to generalize equations 9 11 to the case of a three dimentional chromatographic medium.In the simple case when the characteristics of the three chromatographic systems used are the same and the sample spot is negligibly small we have the simplified equation EMI45.1 hence EMI45.2 The term 4r Q instead of 2 Y originates from the fact that now there are three successive developments and the spots enlarge by molecular diffusion in the two directions perpendicular to the direction of their migration. Numerical calculations have to be made in order to determine the optimum velocity of the solvent.30 Peak capacity in CC 2 In this case the compounds are eluted out of the column by the second solvent, to be detected on line, after a first separation has been made along the first dimension of the plate, as a development. At instant t there is a number EMI46.1 of spots aligned along the exit edge of the plate. The time, t, during which they have undergone diffusion in the radial direction, i.e. the direction perpendicular to the elution see Figs. 9 14 increases during elution, hence their number decreases. During a time dt, the number,of spots eluted is given by an equation similar to equation 6, the time and length standard deviation being related by ae ot L 20 t where ge is the length standard deviation of the spot at column exit and is given by equation 3 with y L2. Accordingly EMI46.2 In equation 21, tl is the time of the first development, L1 U1 so if we assume that D1 is approximately the same for all compounds, we can define for the elution step a plate number EMI46.3 similar to the column plate number but smaller because of the finite size of the spots at the end of the first development when elution is started. Integration of equation 22 can be carried out using the relationship EMI47.1 The integration limits are tRt the retention time at which the analysis is considered as finished, and to, the breakthrough time. They are related by the classical equation tR lik t 24 Hence integration of equation 21 gives EMI47.2 Again if we can neglect ait and consider that the plate characteristics are equal in the two directions, the equation 25 simplifies considerably, into EMI48.1 Even in this case the derivation of the optimum velocity is not straight forward and is best carried out by numerical calculations.40 Peak capacity in CC The sample is placed at the corner of a face of a cube 2 and the separation is first carried out as for TCC 2 by using two successive developments, parallel to the two edges of the cube elution is then achieved along the third dimension. The number of spots spread over the exit face at time t is given by EMI48.2 an equation similar to equation 9, where an additional term has been added to the lateral variances of the zone in the two directions perpendicular to the direction of elution, to account for radial diffusion during elution.Equation 27 is integrated in the same way than equation 9 EMI49.1 The number of spots eluted out of the column during time dt is calculated by using an equation similar to equation 6 cf egs. 19 21 EMI49.2 where 2n is given by equation 28 and is a function of time, while ce is the standard deviation of the zones in the X axis third direction and is obtained by the law of variance addition EMI49.3 If we assume that D1 and D2 are approximately equal for all compounds, we can define a plate number for the elution step, N3, defined exactly as N2 eq. 22 except that we use now equation 30 for a1 . Then EMI50.1 Development of the integrand function gives four expressions similar to EMI50.2 whose integral is 32 EMI50.3 for a positive.Identification with the corresponding terms of equation 31 permits its easy but tedious integration.There are four functions similar to Y in the integration of equation 31, the coefficients a, b, c being complex expressions of the parameters for exampleEMI50.4 EMI50.5 and so on . Since the technique of CC 3 is not very well understood yet and still far from the experimental stage it has not been found useful to print the complete equation at that stage. Calculations have been completed only in the simple case when o, is negligible, the column is a cube and its properties identical in the three directions. The equation 33 simplifies to EMI51.1 In the development of the integrand function, only one expression such as equations 32 33 is found, with simple coefficients. Integration gives EMI51.2 with a 2 35a h a is always smaller than 1 cf Equation 15 it is around 0.25 at optimum flow velocity and tends toward 0 when the velocity becomes very large. For further calculations it is often useful to break H into hdp, as h is also a function of the velocity, while the 3 spot capacity is proportional to LiSp 2 With such a complex expression there is no reason that the maximum spot capacity be obtained at the same velocity for different values of k . DISCUSSION The simplified equations for spot or peak capacity of the various modes of chromatography discussed here are collected in Table I for easy further reference. T A B L E I Simplified equations for column performance.EMI53.1 a 2 h f is given by the plate height equation. h i 0. Column characteristics L, D, u, h identical in all directions. Numerical calculations have been carried out in different cases, to investigate the effect of the various parameters of the four different experiments described above, determine the range of performances which can be expected and find out reasonable values of the parameters permitting the achievement of high resolution separations while using a simple equipment with easy to meet specifications.10 Spot capacity in TCC 2 The spot capacity is given by either the general equation 10 or the simplified equation 14. It is easier to investigate first the simple case of a good square plate, developed at the same speed in the two directions, using retention mechanisms such that the diffusion coefficients in the two solvents are similar. The effect of deviations from this ideal case can be investigated. For example with the typical values r 0 7 A 1 C 0.03, a numerical calculation shows that the maximum spot number Equation 14 is achieved for v 8.9, corresponding to h 2.50. For a 10 x 10cm column packed with d 5ym p particules the maximum spot capacity is 1218, instead of 930 at the optimum flow velocity of 2.6 corresponding to the minimum plate height 1 99 . The gain of 30 results from a trade off between an increase in the axial variance and a marked decrease in the effect of lateral diffusion due to faster analysis. For a typical value of the diffusion coefficient of 5xlO 6 cm2 Is the actual velocity corresponding to v 8.9 is 0.089 cm s 15pm particules . The development time if 112 seconds in both directions, i.e. less than 4 minutes total, which is a drastic reduction compared to typical analysis times in TLC or even column chromatography the chromatograph should be fully automatized to ensure reproducible results.The corresponding pressure for a solvent whose viscosity is 0.01 Poise would be EMI55.1 Because of leak problems, especially on the side of the column, and the kind of safety problems which originate in an equipment designed as the one of Tyihak where the membrane would have to be applied on the lOxlOcmê column with a pressure exceeding 40atm, generating a bursting force of more than 4 tons, first experiments will be made using coarser particles, lower velocities and less viscous solvents. Equation 14 shows that with 10pm particules and a reduced velocity 2.6, still a spot capacity exceeding 450 can be generated with a total analysis time of 26 minutes and a pressure of 2.6atm. This would be very easy to achieve. Performances corresponding to other combinations of parameters are given in Table II where it is seen that extremely large spot capacities can be produced in reasonable times and that the most critical problem is the design of the mechanical enclosure to contain the pressure. A spot capacity of 1,000 could be approached with a pressure drop of 10 atm.

Figure 15 shows the variation of 2n with increasing sample standard deviation as predicted by equation 16. t. rather small sample spot is an important requirement. The specifications are more drastic than in conventional TLC since the performances are better, i.e. the final spots are smaller. These specifications are comparable to those encountered in column chromatography. As as first approximation we can require. a2 o.i L dp 37 which leads to reasonable results figure 15 . The reduction in spot capacity is then 10 15 . When a21 becomes p large, the spot capacity is markedly reduced and eventually tends towards zero. A limited development of the RHS of equation 16 for small values of Ld shows that 2n becomes equivalent to L2 l6. This upper limit of spot capacity is shown on figure 15. As it has been shown that it is quite possible to applyTLC samples with standard deviation around O.lam and to inject samples in CC which are small enough not to contribute significantly to band broadening, there should not be major unexpected difficulties in meeting those specifications and achieving large spot capacities. Equations 14 and 16 show that the spot capacity depends essentially on the column dimension L , the particule size dp and the reduced plate performances htv , exactly the characteristics which determine the peak capacity of a conventional column. From previous discussions on optimization of column performances we know what to do to increase the spot capacity in TCC 2 the packing homogeneity will be critical. For example with h 4 at a reduced velocity of 8 the spot capacity of a lOxlOcm plate made with 5 pm particules is only 825 instead of 1218 of h 2.50. The diffusion coefficient has no effect on the spot capacity, only on the analysis time and pressure. 3 20 Spot capacity in TCC Some numerical calculations have been made with the same conditions as above. The optimum velocity is still larger than in TCC 2 since it is useful to decrease the time during which the spots broaden through lateral diffusion. In the case selected A 1 C 0.03 the optimum velocity is now 12.6 cf Table II . The spot capacity becomes extremely large with values 4 exceeding markedly lox104 within easy reach, while 100,000 does not seem impossible to reach anymore. The critical problems in this case are first column packing, as we can foresee the packing problems associated with the manufacturing of a 10x10x10 cm or larger cube, and then to find out a suitable detector it does not appear practical to slice the cube in O.lmm thick cuts and scan one by one the 1,000 slices with a photodensitometer. The potential reward appears worth of serious research investment in this area, however.30 Peak capacity in CC 2 At a later stage it will probably be necessary to investigate rectangular plates, especially when the two retention mechanisms used will have markedly different selectivity for the components of a complex mixture and optimization will be complex as the two dimensions of the plate and the order in which the two separation mechanisms will be applied may have significant effect on the overall performance. At that stage it is sufficient, however, to consider square columns and assume that their performances are the same in both directions. In fact what is n t most probably the largest difference in properties in the two dimensions is the diffusion coefficient of the solutes in the mobile phase and its viscosity.These parameters determine the analysis time and the pressure drop but have little influence on the spot capacity provided the same reduced velocity is chosen. The effect of the size of the original sample spot have not been taken into account in this study either the specifications will be similar in TCC 2 and CC 2 and we have already calculated them and seen that they can be satisfied with a careful instrument design keeping iê Ldp smaller than 0.1 will result in a loss in peak capacity not exceeding about 108. It is seen in equation 26 that the peak capacity depends separately on the ratio of column length to particule size, on the range of k scanned elution and on the column bed performance, i.e. the reduced plate height at the value of reduced velocity at which the column is operated.The influence of these three factors can be studied separately. The peak capacity increases steadily with increasing range of k fig. 16 . We know that in CC the time optimum range is 0 6.4 the largest peak capacity in a given time, tAt , is obtained by adjusting column length and solvent strength so that the compound with k 6.4 is eluted at time tA l . This is because the peak capacity in CC is given by EMI61.1 and that selecting k 6.4 Ln l k 2 achieves the best compromise between the effect on analysis time of an increase in column length and k range scanned. Equation 26 is much more complicated than equation 38 and it is not possible to obtain a general result in CC ê. Nevertheless we have chose the value k 7 as the end of the analysis when such a choice is necessary, in the following discussion. The dotted line on figure 4 shows the variation of the peak capacity of a column Equation 38 having 4 million theoretical plates, for sake of comparison. 2The curve appears steeper than those corresponding to CC which saturate faster. Consequently is would probably not be worth while to continue development after k 5 or so in CC 2, if we could optimize the plate dimensions and solvent compositions. On the other hand if 1200 spots are eluted out of the column A l between k 0 and k 5, still 300 are eluted between k 5 and k 10 and that capacity could appear useful when it is difficult to increase the size of CC 2 the CC 2 equipment. This explains why the value k 7 is assumed to be a good comparison.Furthermore if we compare equations 14 and 26 Table II we see that the value of k at which the spot capacity of TCC ê is equal to the peak capacity of CC ê depend only on a, and thus on the plate height coefficients. With the numerical values selected here 1A 1.0 C 0.03 , we obtain the same resolution power for k 6.5, a value very close that for which peak capacity of a conventional column is equal to the spot capacity of an overpressured TLC plate k 6.4 . The peak capacity is a function of the plate characteristics which determine both a 2y hv and h. There is of course no reason that the maximum peak capacity be achieved for the velocity which gives the minimum plate height a faster velocity results in a larger variance contribution in the direction of the solvent migration but, because residence time is smaller, in a smaller variance contribution in the perpendicular direction. Figure 17 shows that there is an optimum velocity markedly larger than the one corresponding to the minimum 2 plate height, as in TCC , as discussed in Table II. This optimum velocity increases slightly with the range of k scanned during the analysis and in the conditions of the figure is around v 6.5. The peak capacity is almost 208 larger than at vO 2.6. We note in passing that these results are independent of the plate size and particule diameter. The peak capacity is merely proportional to the length of the column side and inversely proportional toOn the other hand the results shown on figure 17 depend on the values of rut A and C in equation 15.There is little we can do about y 28,29 . A depends on the homogeneity of the bed packing and for a thin layer bed it should not be too difficult to obtain values of A smaller than 1. C describes the mass transfer in the particule and is certainly a function of k but as a first approximation can be assumed to be constant. Figure 18 shows the variation of the peak capacity with the constants A and C, for a 10x10 cm column packed with 5 Sm particules, values well in excess of 1500 can be expected at k 7. The reduced velocity is 7, corresponding to the maximum peak capacity for A 1, C 0.03, but certainly not for the other values of these parameters. It can be expected to increase slowly with decreasing values of A and C. Accordingly we can expect to be able to generate a peak capacity close to 1000 by using a 10x10 cm column, packed carefully A 0.7 with 10 sm particules as typically used inCC, with a reduced velocity close to 7, a pressure drop around 5 atm Table II and recording the chromatograph for values of k up to ca 10.40 Peak capacity in CC 3 In view of the difficulties encountered in the design 2 and construction of a CC chromatograph it seems too early to discuss in details the potential performances of a CC 3 chromatograph. Furthermore equation 35 is similar to equation 26, the parameters L and d are separated from the p column characteristics and the consequences will be similar 2 to those encountered in CC . The numbers, however, are now gigantic. The peak capacity is maximum for a relatively large value of the reduced velocity, which would be quite convenient for the analysis of heavy molecular weight compounds such as biopolimers. The optimum reduced velocity is around 14, but would be markedly smaller should the performance of the three dimensional packed bed be less satisfactory than assumed in the calculations figure 19 . The peak capacity increases very rapidly with increasing k at the beginning, but levels off at values above 10. It is clear from equation 35 that there is a limit at large k . A peak capacity equal to the spot capacity of the same column used in TCC 3 is achieved for k 6.8 with the numerical values chosen here A 1.0 C 0.03 . The limit at very large k is about 50 larger so in practice it is not easy to have better separation efficiency in CC 3 than 3 in TCC The peak capacity increases very rapidly with increasing ratio of column length to particle size cf figure 8 . As in TCC 3, peak capacities of several ten thousands would be easy to reach while a capacity of 100,000 is a theoretical possibility, for example with a 12xl2xl2cm cube well packed with 3 ym particles. The potential performances of mono , bi , and tridimensional column chromatography are compared in Table III. It must be understood that the peak capacities are not obtained at the same reduced velocity so the ratio 2n n and 3n 2n have been calculated just to show that the peak capacity increases more slowly than with the power of the space dimension used.

Thus we have provided a multi column real time chromatograph in which a plurality of samples may be injected into a flowing sheet of fluid to be eluted out across a linear detector MTCC . We have provided a two dimensional liquid chromatograph in which over pressure development is proved in both directions. If development in the second direction is stopped before elution of the desired components, the chromatogram may be read in a conventional manner TCC 2. If elution is continued the components are detected as they pass by a linear array detector CC 2. We have provided three dimensional column chromatography CC 3.We have provided novel apparatus for performing the above, including a steel cuvette for performing MTCC , TCC and CC a block separation medium and tomagraphic detector for providing a third separation after CC 2 and have derived criteria for selecting optimum flow rates during separation. It will thus be seen that the objects set forth above, among those made apparent from the preceding description, are efficiently attained and, since certain changes may be made in carrying out the above methods and systems and in the constructions set forth without departing from the scope of the invention, it is intended that all matter contained in the above description or shown in the accompanying drawing shall be interpreted as illustrative and not in a limiting sense. Particularly, although we have discussed the first chromatographic development as producing a linear array of sub components and the second dimensional chromatographic development as producing a planar array of sub subcomponents, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the first development is uni dimensional and may be along a curve as well as a straight line, and the second development is two dimensional and may be on a curved surface as well as a flat surface. Where we have described the use of multiple photo diode detectors, scanning detectors using flying spots, or cathode ray devices may also be employed. In fact any form of detector suitable to measure the quality of an unknown component being sought may be employed, such as electro chemical detectors. Where we have mentioned two or three retention media, it will be understood that the stationary phase may be the same in successive dimensional developments and the fluid phase changed, or vice versa, or the fluid and stationary phases may be different in each separate development. Other separation mechanisms known in the art may be employed such as absorption chromatography in normal or reverse phase or electrophoresis. It is also to be understood that the following claims are intended to cover all of the generic and specific features of the invention herein described and all statements of the scope of the invention which, as a matter of language, might be said to fall therebetween.
