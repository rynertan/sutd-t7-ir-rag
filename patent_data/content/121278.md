# Attenuator circuit.

## Abstract
A frequency to phase converter comprises an attenuator circuit 1 , a delay circuit 2 and a comparator 3 . The attenuator circuit 1 is provided with two transistors T₁, T₂ , which are arranged as a differential pair and whose collectors 9, 10 are coupled to the positive supply voltage terminal 5 . A voltage divider R
