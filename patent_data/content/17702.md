# Rotary to linear motion conversion device and typewriter character selection mechanism including the same.

## Abstract
A rotary to linear motion conversion device comprises a rotatable shaft 32 and an annular cam surface member 36 encircling the shaft 32 and pivotally mounted on a bracket 44 secured to the shaft 32 . The member 36 is engaged by an arm 27 of a pivoted cam follower 26 biased towards the member 36 . The portion of the mem ber 36 diametrally opposite the pivot 40 engages a slider 48 rotatable with the shaft 32 . The slider 48 engages a flange 56 and a collar 60 . Between the collar 60 and a fixed stop 64 are four selectively with drawable interposers 70, 72, 74 and 76 of increasing in cremental widths. Two such devices are included in a typewriter character selection system to control tilt and rotation of a typehead. The tilt and rotate cam members are mounted so that they pivot to vary the cam rise. The rise of the cam is controlled by the interposers under the influence of the keyboard.
