# Multi function rotary dial system including timer setting feature.

## Abstract
In a multi function video tape recorder system, a manu ally operable rotary dial 200 is used in place of a large number of dedicated manual switches, to make selections from multiple choice lists and to assign numerical values for timing, etc. The rotary dial 200 is journalled on a fold down section 120 of the video tape recorder s front console 110 and its manually actuated rotation is monitored by optical sensors. A microprocessor receives the output of the sensors and so can derive the angular position and speed and direction of rotation of the rotary dial 200 , which may all serve as input parameters. In addition, a ring may be included in the rotary dial assembly, the ring being pivotable slightly relative to the rotary dial itself to provide an additional information input. The rotary dial can be used to input date and time information for both clock setting and timer setting operations, to select a television channel for recording or direct reception, to select the speed and mode of video playback and or to control the rate and direction of frame advance.
