# TOOL FOR SPIRAL MACHINING

## Abstract
The tool 10 includes a base 9,9a for carrying a hollow stationary tube 7 on which is rotatably mounted a circular platform 31 . A clamp 12 can securely clamp tool 10 to a work member 25 requiring a machining operation. A socket 49 is movably mounted on a cutter box 40 , which is coupled to the face 33 of the platform, for linear radial movement in a direction relative to the center of the platform. The radial movement is achieved by planetary action which is controlled by a clutch mechanism 76 mounted on tube 7. Thus, the linear movement of the socket is derived from the rotary motion of the platform. In a preferred embodiment, the cutter box can pivot about the axis of a drive shaft 41 which is rotatably coupled to a planetary shaft 71. The rotation of the drive shaft is selectively translated by a clutch 53 and a transmission 45 into the radial movement of the socket, which is adapted to accept relatively inexpensive, conven tional cutters 50 that can cut across the face 26 of the work member a continuous, spiral pattern.
