# Control device for a continuous rolling machine.

## Abstract
A control device for a continuous rolling machine includes a forecaster for predicting a change in the lateral dimension of a rolled material at the exit of a downstream mill stand based on dimensional variations, and a mechan ism by which the tension on the material between two mill stands is altered in accordance with the forecast value, to control the lateral dimension of rolled material exiting the last of a series of mill stands.
