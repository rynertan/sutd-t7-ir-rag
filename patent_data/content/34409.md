# Liquid crystal display systems using fiber optic faceplates.

## Abstract
In a liquid crystal image display system, a fiber optic faceplate 24 which transmits light only through a well defined acceptance cone 2Ï‘ MAX is optically coupled to the liquid crystal display surface of a reflective dynamic scattering mode liquid crystal display device 10 . In an image projector embodiment, light from an external light source 26 is directed through the faceplate 24 onto the liquid crystal display surface. Light scattered by activated on state regions of the liquid crystal is substantially absorbed by the faceplate while light reflected from the non activated off state regions of the display surface is transmit ted back through the faceplate to a projection lens 35 which forms an image on a viewing screen 36 . In a second embodiment of the invention a viewer directly observes the liquid crystal display surface under ambient light from either natural or artificial light sources. By absorbing light from unwanted sources outside its transmission accep tance cone, the faceplate prevents loss of image contrast while transmitting light from sources within its acceptance cone needed to illuminate the display.
