# Combinatorial weighing apparatus.

## Abstract
A combinatorial weighing apparatus has a plurality of weighing hoppers 2d for receiving batches of articles to be weighed, weight sensors 3 for weighing the batches of articles in the weighing hoppers, storage hoppers 7 dis posed beneath auxiliary hopper gates 2e of the weighing hoppers and adapted to receive the batches of articles discharged from the weighing hoppers, and a combination control unit adapted to select a best combination of hoppers which provides a total weight equal to or most closely approximating the target value, on the basis of the weight values of batches of articles in the storage hoppers and the weighing hoppers. This can reduce the number of weighing hoppers required to give a desired weighing accuracy.
