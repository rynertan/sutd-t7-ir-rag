# Disc drive for flexible discs with different track widths.

## Abstract
A flexible disc device includes a magnetic head for reading data written on a flexible disc medium or writing data to the medium. The head selects its effective track width as defined by the core width of the read write head gap 22 and the erase head gaps 24a, 24b to correspond with the record density of the disc. Thus flexible disc media with different track densities are made compatible.
