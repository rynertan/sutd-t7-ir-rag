# Switch operating mechanism.

## Abstract
A switch operating mechanism for use in a telephone instrument for example, for operating a hook switch has two arms 4 and 5 for projection from and independent displacement with respect to an outer surface of the instrument body 1 . The arms 4 and 5 are arranged to co operate with a switch actuating member 13 such that this member adopts a first position when both arms 4 and 5 are retracted with respect to the body 1 , and a second position when one or both of the arms 4 and 5 is or are extended from the body 1 . This mechanism is particularly advantageous for operating the hook switch in a one piece telephone instrument because inadvertant depression of one of the arms 4 or 5 does not cause actuation of the hook switch.
