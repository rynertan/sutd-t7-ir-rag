# A process for producing a thermoplastic resin and a resin composition containing the same.

## Abstract
A thermoplastic resin having excellent thermal stability and a high heat resistance is prepared by initiating polymer ization of from 65 to 85 parts by weight of a monomer mixture A consisting of from 50 to 85 by weight of α methylstyrene, from 3 to 20 by weight of methyl methacrylate, from 2 to 20 by weight of acrylonitrile and from 0 to 25 by weight of an aromatic alkenyl compound other than α methylstyrene, continuously or intermittently adding, in the course of the polymerization, from 2 to 15 parts by weight of a monomer B consisting of acrylonitrile or a mixture thereof with an aromatic alkenyl compound other than α methylstyrene to the polymerization system while continuing the polymerization, further adding to the polymerizatton system from 5 to 25 parts by weight of a monomer C consisting of an aromatic alkenyl compound other than α methylstyrene, or a mixture thereof with acrylonitrile, and completing the polymerization, the total amount of monomers A , B and C being 100 parts by weight. Further, a thermoplastic resin composition having excellent thermal stability, a high heat resistance and a high impact strength is prepared by mixing this thermoplastic resin with a graft copolymer obtained by grafting from 60 to 30 parts by weight of a monomer mixture comprising from 65 to 80 by weight of an aromatic alkenyl compound and from 35 to 20 by weight of acrylonitrile on from 40 to 70 parts by weight of a diene rubbery polymer in such a proportion that the composition contains from 10 to 30 by weight of the rubbery polymer.
