# Optical recording medium.

## Abstract
Disclosed is an optical recording medium. This optical recording medium has a substrate 10 made of a transparent material such as an acrylic resin and a recording layer 12 for receiving an energy beam such as a laser beam whose intensity is changed in response to quantized information and for recording desired information by melt deforming in response to the intensity of the energy beam. The recording layer 12 contains tellurium as a base material and carbon at a predetermined content of 40 atomic percent.
