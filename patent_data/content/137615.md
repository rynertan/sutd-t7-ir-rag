## Description
FABRIC CLEANING COMPOSITIONS FOR CLAY BASED STAINS Technical Field The present invention relates to compositions and processes for removing clay based soils and stains from fabrics. The compositions are particularly adapted for removing cosmetic stains, which comprise a mixture of claybased material and an oily or greasy binder material. Compositions which comprise a solvent ingredient to disperse the binder and a polyamine material to disperse the clay are provided. These compositions can be used in the form of a simple fabric pre spotter, or in fully formulated laundry detergents comprising a mixture of various ingredients designed to remove a broad spectrum of stains and soils from fabrics, with particularly noteworthy benefits on stains caused by cosmetics. Background Detergent formulators are faced with the task of devising products to removea broad spectrum of soils and stains from fabrics. Chemically and physico chemically, the varieties of soils and stains range the spectrum from primarily oily, through proteinaceous and carbohydrate, to inorganic,. and detergent compositions have become more complex as formulators attempt to provide products which handle all types, concurrently. For example, protease enzymes are commonly used in detergents for blood and gravy stains amylase enzymes are used for carbohydrate stains nonionic surfactants are used for hydrocarbon oils and anio flic surfactants and builders are used for particulate soil.Bleach is used to chemically degrade stains that are not amenable to removal by less rigorous treatment. One of the most difficult stains to remove from fabrics is the cosmetic stain, and from time immemorial the persistent, telltale smudge of lipstick on a shirtcollar or handkerchief has been the downfall of many a miscreant. Moreover, the remarkable ability of the modern cosmetic industry to provide products which are more and more long lasting on the user s skin necessarily means that today s cosmetics are increasingly persistent on fabrics to which they are unintentionally applied. Chemically, many cosmetics comprise a clay base which serves in part as a filler, thickened, carrier for color bodies, and the like, blended with an oily material which serves partially as a binder, gloss agent and emollient.Cosmetics are typically manufactured with great care, such that the clay and color bodies are in the form of very fine particles, and are very thoroughly and completely mixed with, and coated by, the oily material, which may be a hydrocarbon oil, silicone, lipid, or complex mixtures thereof.While optimal from the standpoint of the cosmetic formulator, the modern cosmetic product causes major problems for the detergent formulator, since cosmetics constitute a mix of widely divergent soil types oily, particulate, clay all in intimate admixture and often brightly colored. No single detergent ingredient can reasonably be expected to handle such a complex milieu. The present invention employs oil removal solvents and clay removal polyamines. The solvents dissolve the oil base of the cosmetics, thereby exposing their clay component to the polyamine materials which disperse and remove it from fabrics. The use of solvents of the type employed in this invention as grease and oil removal ingredients in cleaners of various types i well known commercially and from the patent l i .erature . See, ror example, U.S. Patent 2.073.464 EPO hs z2 ions 0 072 488 anc 81200540.3 British Patent .603.047. However, te use of such solvents in combination with polyamine materials in the manner disclosed herein is not believed to have been contemplated, heretofore. Summary of the Invention The present invention relates to compositions and processes for removing cosmetic stains1 and the like, from fabrics, by means of a solvent especially solvents such as isoparaffinic hydrocarbons, kerosene, petroleum fractions, d limonene or mixed terpenes, fatty alcohols, benzyl alcohol and mixtures thereof and an alkoxylated polyamine as described more fully hereinafter at a weight ratio of solvent polyamine of 100 1 to 1 20, preferably at least 2 1.The invention also encompasses fully formulated detergent compositions which comprise conventional detergency ingredients such as detergency builders, enzymes, detersive surfactants, and the like, characterized in that such compositions contain at least about 5 by weight of the aforesaid mixture of solvent and polyamine. Preferably, such fully formulated detergent compositions contain at least 5 of the solvent and at least 0.2 of the polyamine. Detailed Description of the Invention The essential solvent and polyamine components, as well as the preferred surfactant components and other optional ingredients used in the practice of the present invention are described in more detail, hereinafter. All percentages and ratios mentioned in this specification are by weight, unless otherwise stated. Solvent The solvents employed herein can be any of the well known degreasing solvents commonly known for use in, for example, the commercial laundry and drycleaning industry, in the hard surface cleaner industry and the metalworking industry. Typically, such solvents comprise hydrocarbon or halogenated hydrocarbon moieties of the alkyl or cycloalkyl type, and have a boiling point well above room temperature. The formulator of compositions of the present type will be guided in the selection of solvent partly by the need to provide good grease cutting properties, and partly by aesthetic considerations. For example, kerosene hydrocarbons function quite well in the present compositions, but can be malodorous. Kerosene can be used in commercial laundries.For home use, where malodors would not be tolerated, the formulator would be more likely to select solvents which have a relatively pleasant odor, or odors which can be reasonably modified by perfuming. Such solvents include, for example, the terpenes and terpenoid solvents obtainable from citrus fruits, especially orange terpenes and d limonene. Benzyl alcohol is another relatively pleasant smelling solvent for use herein. Excellent solvents for use herein are paraffins and the mono and bicyclic mono terpenes, i.e., those of the hydrocarbon class, which include, for example, the terpinenes, limonenes and pinenes, and mixtures thereof. Highly preferred materials of this type are d limonene and the mixture of terpene hydrocarbons obtained from the essence of oranges e.g.cold pressed orange terpenes and orange terpene oil phase ex fruit juice . Also useful are, for example, terpenes such as dipentene, alpha pinene, beta pinene and the mixture of terpene hydrocarbons expressed from lemons and grapefruit. The examples disclosed hereinafter describe various other solvents which can be used herein. Polyamines It is to be understood that the term polyamines as used herein represents generically the alkoxylated polyamines, both in their amine form and in their quaternarized form.Such materials can conveniently be represented as molecules of the empirical structures with repeating units EMI5.1 tb SEP SEP R SEP tb SEP x tb SEP alkoxy tb Amine form andEMI5.2 tb SEP R tb SEP R SEP SEP tb SEP x tb SEP alkoxy tb Quaternarized form wherein R is a hydrocarbyl group, usually of 2 6 carbon atoms R may be a C1 C20 hydrocarbon the alkoxy groups are polyethoxy, polypropoxy, and the like, with polyethoxy having a degree of polymerization of 2 30, most preferably, 10 to 20 x is an integer of at least 2, preferably from 2 20, most preferably 3 5 and This is an anion such as halide or methylsulfate, resulting from the quaternization reaction. The most highly preferred polyamines for use herein are the so called ethoxylated polyethylene imines, i.e., the polymerized reaction product of ethylene oxide with ethyleneimine, having the general formula EMI5.3 wherein x is an integer of 3 to 5 and y is an integer of 10 to 20.Surfactants In addition to the solvent and polyamine, it is optional, but highly preferred, that the compositions herein contain organic surface active agents 0 surfactants to provide the usual cleaning benefits associated with the use of such materials. Water soluble detersive surfactants useful herein include well known synthetic anionic, nonionic, amphoteric and zwitterionic surfactants. Typical of these are the alkyl benzene sulfonates, alkyl and alkylether sulfates, paraffin sulfonates, olefin sulfonates, alkoxylated especially ethoxylated alcohols and alkyl phenols, amine oxides,ot sulfonates of fatty acids and of fatty acid esters, and the like, which are well known from the detergency art. In general, such detersive surfactants contain an alkyl group in the Cg Clss range the anionic detersive surfactants are most commonly used in the form of their sodium, potassium or triethanolammonium salts the nonionics generally contain from about 5 to about 17 ethylene oxide groups. U.S.Patents 4.111.855 and 3.995.669 contain detailed listings of such typical detersive surfactants. C11 C16 alkyl benzene sulfonates, C12 C18 paraffin sulfonates and alkyl sulfates, and the ethoxylated alcohols and alkyl phenols are especially preferred in the compositions of the present type. The surfactant component can comprise as little as 1 of the compositions herein, but preferably the compositions will contain 1 to 40 , preferably 5 to30 , of surfactant. Mixtures of the ethoxylated nonionics with anionics such as the alkyl benzene sulfonates, alkyl sulfates and paraffin sulfonates are preferred for through the wash cleansing of a broad spectrum of soils and stains from fabrics.Fatty Acid Soap Ingredient Fatty acids generally C10 C18 chain length and their water soluble salts i.e., common soaps , especially alkali metal soaps can be used in the present compositions not only for their detersivesurfactant properties, but also to provide an additional detergent builder function by virtue of their ability to interact with water hardness cations. As will be described more full. hereinafter, fatty acids and soaps are particularly useful when preparing fully formulated, homogeneous oil in water liquid detergents comprising the solvent and polyamine in an aqueous carrier. Usage levels of 0.5 50 are typical.Other Optional Ingredients The compositions herein can contain other ingredients which aid in their cleaning performance. For example, it is highly preferred that throughthe wash detergent compositions contain a detergent builder and or metal ion sequestrant. Compounds classifiable and well known in the art as detergent builders include the nitrilotriacetates, polycarboxylates, citrates, watersoluble phosphates such as tri polyphosphate and sodium ortho and pyro phosphates, silicates, and mixtures thereof.Metal ion sequestrants include all of the above, plus materials like ethylenediaminetetraacetate, the amino polyphosphonates and phosphates DEQUEST and a wide variety of other poly functional organic acids and salts too numerous to mention in detail here. See U.S. Patent 3.579.454 for typical examples of the use of such materials in various cleaning compositions. In general, the builder seguestrant will comprise about 0.5 to 15 of the composition. Citrate is one of the most preferred builders since it is readily soluble in the aqueous phase of heavy duty liquid detergent compositions. The compositions herein also preferably contain enzymes to enhance their through the wash cleaning performance on a variety of soils and stains. Amylase and protease enzymes suitable for use in detergents are well known in the art and in commercially available liquid and granular detergents.Commercial detersive enzymes preferably a mixture of amylase and protease are typically used at levels of 0.001 to 2 , and higher, in the present compositions.Ingredients such as propane diol and or formate and calcium. ca be added to help stabilize the enzymes in well known fashion, according to the desires of the formu iator. Moreover, the compositions herein can contain, in addition to ingredients already mentioned, various other optional ingredients typically used in commercial products to provide aesthetic or additional product performance benefits.Typical ingredients include pH regulants, perfumes, dyes, optical brighteners, soil suspending agents, hydrotropes and gel control agents, freeze thaw stabilizers, bactericides, preservatives, suds control agents and the like. Water alcohol e.g., ethanol, isopropanol, etc. mixtures can be used as the carrier vehicle in liquid compositions, and alkylated polysaccharides can be used to increase the the stability and performance characteristics of the compositions. The compositions herein are preferably formulated in the neutral to alkaline pH range, generally in the range of pH 6.5 9.0, preferably about 6,s 7.5. Materials such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hwhxide, the alkanol amines such as trie thanol amines, or maanesiun hvda ddE, can be used to adjust the nH, as desired. Preferred pH adjusting agents are described hereinafter. The preferred compositions herein are in liquid form, which can be prepared by simply blending the essential and optional ingredients in a fluid preferably aqueous carrier.As mentioned hereinabove, fatty acid or soap can be used in such liquid compositions to provide clear, homogeneous microemulsions of the solvent in an aqueous carrier. Solid or granular compositions can be prepared by adsorbing the solvent and polyamine in a suitable granular carrier, for example, in a sodium sulfate, sodium perborate bleach or spray dried detergent granule carrier. In one process aspect, the compositions herein in the form of liquids or pastes can be used to pre treat soiled fabrics by rubbing a few milliliters of the composition directly onto and into the soiled area, followed by laundering, in standard fashion. In a through the wash mode, the compo sitions are typically used at a concentration of at least 50 pprr., preferably 0.1 to 1.5E in an aqueous laundry bath at pH 6.5 10 to launder fabrics. The laundering can be carried out over the range from 50C to the boil, with excellent results. Industrial Application The following examples describe a variety of formulations which can be prepared in the manner of the present invention using the mixed solvent polyamine ingredients.The examples are given by way of illustration and are not intended to be limiting of the scope of the invention. In the formulations listed, the terms x and y are stated in parentheses to aesignate the aegree of polymerization and degree of alkoxylation of the polyamine. For some polyami nes , the designation R is also included, thereby denoting a quaternarized polyamine. For such quaternarized materials, the resulting anion p is of no consequence to cleaning performance, and is not designated. In all examples, R is CH2 CH2 and alkoxyl is ethoxyl, unless otherwise specified. Example I Following the teachings of U.S. Patent 3,664,962, a spot remover in stick form is prepared by blending the following ingredients, extruding the resulting mass through a 1.25 cm die, and packaging the resulting stick in an aluminum foil wrapper.

The garment is thereafter brushed, or optionally laundered, to remove the stain, together with residues from the stick. Example 11 A liquid fabric pre treatment and through the wash detergency booster is prepared by blending the following ingredients. Ingredient Parts by WeightParaffin oil deodorized 20 wolyasineAs 3, y l5 evg. 7Water 50 Ethoxylated sorbitan oleate 3 In a preferred method of use, a few 1 10 milliliters of the composition of Example II are applied directly to an area of fabric stained with clay grease soil and rubbed briskly into the stained area. The fabric is thereafter laundered with a commercial laundry detergent e.g.,VIZIR according to label instructions. In an alternate mode, the composition of Example II is added directly to an aqueous laundry bath, generally at a level of 500 5000 ppm, depending on the desires of the user and the soil load, together with a commercial laundry detergent, to enhance cleaning performance. The composition of Example II can be diluted 1 1 with water or water ethanol and packaged in an aerosol or manual pump dispenser for use as a spot remover. Example III A granular detergent composition comprising the solvent polyamine compositions of the present invention can be prepared by blending the solventXpolyamine with a spray dried commercwa iauncr detergent. However, in a preferred mode, the solvertXpolyamine is admixed with non neutralized anionic surfactant, which is then admixed with alkaline detergency builder and other optional detergency ingredients, whereby the surfactant is neutralized in situ in the product. This method of formulation solvent containing granular detergents is described by A.Davidsohn in the report of the original lectures, 3rdInternational Congress of Surface Activity Cologne, pages 165 to 172 at 171 1960 .

Examples IV IX The following examples relate to compositions within the scope of this invention with solvents which are particularly suitable in industrial, heavy duty laundry and cleaning plants, and the like. It will be appreciated by the formulator that some of the solvents employed in such compositions may be unsuitable for general home use, due to malodors, potential for skin irritation, low flash points, and the like.However, suc compositions are entireiy suitable for use under properly controlled conditions by professional operators who take such matters into consideration. In Examples IV IX, all ingredients are listed as parts by weight.

The heavy duty liquid detergents disclosed hereinafter are formulated with a variety of detersive ingredients to provide excellent cleaning of a wide variety soils and stains, and wherein the solvent polyamine contributes significantly to the removal of clay grease and dirty motor oil stains from fabrics. It is to be understood that, while such formulations can be prepared as water in oil emulsions, they are preferably prepared in the form of oil in water emulsions wherein the solvent is considered the oil phase and are most preferably in the form of substantially clear, homogeneous oil in water microemulsions. The formulator of heavy duty liquid detergents will appreciate that using water as the carrier phase in such compositions is a significant cost saving, and will further appreciate that an aqueous carrier phase contributes importantly to ease of formulation, since water soluble detersive ingredients can be more readily incorporated into oil in water emulsions than in water in oil emulsions.Surprisingly, when used in a pre treatment mode, the oil in water emulsions herein are comparable in grease cuttinc performance to water in oil emulsions, which have much higher concentrations of solvent.The compositions herein with high concentrations of surfactant and fatty acid soap may be packaged in high density polyethylene bottles without solvent loss. Example X A heavy duty liquid detergent in the form of a clear, homogeneous oil in water emulsion which shows excellent performance with a wide variety of clay soil types of stain is prepared as follows INGREDIENT PARTS BY WEIGHTPolyamine x 5i yzli 1.5Ethanol 3.0Potassium hydroxide 50 in water 8.0Alkyl C11.8 benzene sulphonic acid 11.0Alkyl C14,15 ethoxylate E07 15.0Potassium citrate monhydrate 63,54 in water 2.4 Dequest 2060 S TM 1.2Sodium formate 40 in water 2.5Ca as CaC12 6H20 60 ppmOrange Terpenes 10.0Lauric myristic acid 60 40 12.5Oleic acid 2.5 Maxatase TM enzyme 0.71 Termamyl TM enzyme 0.10Optical brightener anionic 0.23Perfume 0.5Dye 20 ppmWater to 100Product pH 7.3 Diethylene triamine pentamethylene phosphonic acid Monsanto KINGS, supplier NOVO, supplierThe above composition is prepared by blending the indicated ingredients to provide a clear, stable microemulsion. in laundry tests, particularly with a pre treatment step, the composition gives excellent performance on a wide variety of stains, including cosmetics and dirty motor oil.Preferred compositions of the foregoing microemulsion type will generally contain 10 20 of the fatty acid mix and be formulated at pH 6.6 7.3. EXAMPLE SI T e composition of Exarpie N is modified slightly by using C.t parts by weight of magnesium hydroxide in place of 1.2 parts of potassium hydroxide 50 ì te adjust pH to 7.0. The resulting product is a homogeneous microemulsion. EXAMPLE XIIThe composition of Examples X and XI are modified by replacing the orange terpene by a mixture of deodorized paraffin oil iso C10 Cl2 7.5 of the total ccposition and orange terpenes 2.5E of the total composition . This change in the solvent component in no way detracts from the performance attributes of the compositions, but allows the perfumer more latitude for introducing non citrus perfume notes. Anionic optical brightener 0.01 0.5 may be added, as desired.SOLVENT SELECTION As disclosed hereinabove, final selection of the solvent system for use in the present compositions will be dependant upon soil type and load, aesthetics odour etc. However, a number of criteria can be used to guide this selection.For example, the solvent should be substantially water immiscible and, it should of course be capable of solubilizing a broad range of problem greasy soils. In this latter respect thermodynamic solubility parameters Hansen Parameters are useful in making the solvent selection. Any solvent can be described by the Hansen Parameters zdS , h 6d being the dispersion component dp the polarity component and h the hydrogen bonding component.Likerwise, key greasy problem soils can be described by pseudo Hansen Parameters. In order to do this the solubility of each greasy stain in a broad range of solvents of differentHansen Parameters is first assessed. This can be done by immersing the greasy stain on a range of different fabric types cotton, polyester cotton, acrylic in each solvent in tur for a fixed time say, 5 minutes under fixed agitation. On removal, excess solvent is drained off and the stained fabric is washed for 5 minutes in cool water containing 1 concentration of a typical liquid laundry detergent. Following final rinsing in cold water and drying, the stain removal can be assessed visuall or by any other suitable technique.By proceeding in this way, those solvents giving best removal of each problem greasy stain can be identified, and thereby the range of each Hansen Parameter required for optimum removal of that particular stain can be assessed. Thus, for each stain a map of Hansen Parameters can be developed, and solvent solvent combinations can be selected on this basis to give the target performance profile. Although not intended to be limiting of the present invention, the above technique indicates that mixed solvent solvent compositions with Hansen Parameters in the range Sd 7 to 9 , 5 O to 4 , dh O to 7 allow the p formulation of microemulsions with superior greasy stain removal performance. The solvent combination can be targeted against particular greasy stains, such as motor oil, where the optimum Hansen Parameter range is dd 7 to 9 ,doh O to 4 dp O to 3 or marker ink, where the optimum range is bd 769 , 5h 2 to 11 , p 2 to 7 , or targeted more broadly against mixed stains by selecting an intermediate point in the range of Hansen Parameters. Some preferred solvents and solvent mixtures herein, especially orange terpenes d limonene , paraffins especially iso c1O Cl2 cyclohexanei kerosene orange terpene benzyl alcohol 60 40 , n paraffins C12 15 hexanol 50 50 , fall within the Hansen Parameters, as stated. These solvents and solvent mixtures are typically used at concentrations of 5 20 , preferably 5 10 , in the present compositions. Slightly polar solvents such as benzyl alcohol or n hexanol can be used with water immiscible solvents such as terpenes and paraffin oil at levels of O 10 . Various other solvent mixtures are disclosed in Example XIX, hereinafter. As can be seen from the foregoing, the present invention encompasses a variety of formulations in the form of stable, solvent containing emulsions. A superior heavy duty liquid detergent composition can also be prepared using a solvent system comprising diethyl phthalate preferred or dibutyl phthalate in combination with the terpenes preferably, orange terpene or dipentene, or paraffin oils, or most preferably mixtures thereof. The following is a representative example of such a composition. EXAMPLE XIII Ingredient Parts by weightPolyamine x 5 y 15 1.5Potassium Hydroxide 50 Aq. 8.0Ethanol 3.0 C118 Alkyl Benzene Sulphonic Acid 11.0 cl4 l5 Alkyl Ethoxylate EO 7 15.0Potassium Citrate 63.5 Ag. 2.4Deodorized Paraffin Oil 7.5Orange Terpene 2.5Dibutyl phthalate 3.0Lauric Myristic Acids 60 40 12.5Enzymes per Ex.

It will be appreciated that many of the foregoing compositions comprising the terpene hydrocarbons will necessarily have a rather strong citrus odor that mqy not be entirely acceptable to all formulators of such compositfons. It has now been discovered that the C 6 .C9 alkyl aromatic solvents, especially the CJCa alkyl benzenes, preferably octyl benzene, exhibit excellent grease removal properties and have a low, pleasant odor. Likewise, the olefin solvents having a boiling point of at least about 100 CC, espe cially alpha oleftns, preferably l decene cr 1 dodecene, are excellent grease removal solvents. The combination of the aforesaid alkyl aromatic or olefin solvents wIth polar liquids such as benzyl alcohol, n hexanol, Butyl Carbitol Trade Mark 2 2 butoxyethoxy ethanol or the phthalic acrid esters constitute additional examples of preferred non polar polar solvents that are preferred for use in the practice of this invention. The following additional examples further illustrate oil in water microemulsions. In Example XVII, the use of the quaternary ammonium compound to adjust the pH of the formulation to a pH just barely below neutrality contributes importantly to product performance while maintaining longterm microemulsion stability.

Another preferred olefin solvent herein by virtue of its relatively low odor is the so called P 4 polymer, available from a number of petrochemical suppliers to the detergent industry as a raw material for branched alkyl benzene. P 4 is an isomer mix of the condensation product of 4 moles of propylene, i.e., C12 branched olefines. P 4 is nonpolar, and is preferably used in combination with a polar solvent such as benzyl alcohol,diethylphthate, Butyl Carbitol, or the like Other useful polar solvents herein include the cellosolves e.g. alkoxyl alkanols such as 2 butoxyethanol C6 C12 alkanols including.benzyl alcohol such as dodecanol, phenethyl alcohol, diglycolether acetates,hexyl cellosolve and hexyl carbitol, and the like.

Nitrogen functional Stabilizers oH Regulants As disclosed in Examples XIII and XVII. above, various alkyl and cyclo alkyl amines. quaternary ammonium compounds. as well as amine oxides, constitute a highly preferred class of pH regulants and stabilizers in the oil in water microemulsion detergent compositions of the present type.Apparently. such materials may somehow associate with the fatty acid or anionic surfactants to form a complex which stabilizes the microemulsified oil solvent . While the nitrogen functional compounds do not boost the pH very much towards the alkaline range only several tenths of a pH unit, measured on the product formulated as is the resulting boost in detergency performance, especially enzymatic cleaning performance, is substantial. Parenthetically, it is to be understood that with regard to pH adjustments in the compositions up to about pH 6.5 6.6, any of the well known base materials can be used. for example, triethanolamine. alkali metal hydroxide and the like. Potassium hydroxide is preferred over sodium hydroxide, inasmuch as the ease of formulation of stable systems is increased substantially by the potassium cation. Dioctyl dimethyl ammonium chloride is a highly preferred quaternary used herein as a pH regulant, but there can also be mentioned the following quaternaries in increasing order of preference of use coconut trimethyl ammonium chloride 6.66 di coconut dimethyl ammonium chloride 6.84 coconut benzyl dimethyl ammonium chloride 6.84 and dihexyl dimethyl ammonium chloride 6.89 .The numbers in parentheses denote the pH achievable by adding the respective quaternaries to a liquid oil in water microemulsion containing fatty acid and formulated at an as is pH of 6.5. For the preferred dioctyl dimethyl ammonium chloride, the pH figure is 6.94. Suitable alkyl and cyclo alkyl amines useful herein with attendant pHs include coconutalkyl diethanol amine 6.65 coconutalkyl dimethyl amine 6.75 trioctyl amine 7.0 and cyclohexyl amine 7.5 . Suitable amine oxides herein include coconutalkyl dimethylamine oxide 6.7 and dioctyl methylamine oxide est. 7 . It is to be understood that the foregoing nitrogen compounds can be added to the compositions until the desired pH is obtained. To achieve the pH listed, from 0.5 to 5 of the compounds are typically used in the compositions. Cyclohexyl amine 1 5 is most preferred for use herein. In general terms, the most highly preferred oil in water microemulsion form of the compositions herein comprise a 10 to 70 water carrier b 5 to 20 grease removal solvent or solvent mixture c 5 to 35 fatty acid or fatty acid soap mixture do 1 to 40 detersive surfactant e 0.001 to 2 detersive enzyme f at least 0.2 alkoxylated polyamine and g said composition being adjusted to a pH undiluted of 6.6 7 .5 using a nitrogenous material as described especially cyclohexylamine. Microemulsion stability of such composition can be estimated visually by watching for phase separation. or can be monitored quantitatively by standard turbidometric techniques. Product as is pH is measured at ambient 230C temperature using a commercial pH meter. The electrode is immersed in the product and the meter is allowed to stabilize before reading.
