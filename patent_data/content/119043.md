The lid is fastened in its closed position by fastening devices 20 disposed on the rims 12,16 opposite the hinge. The lid 2 comprises a generally flat top 13 and flat peripheral walls 14,15 and is supported and reinforced by a cardboard insert 25 having a top and depending flaps 27,28 juxtaposed the lid top and walls 13,14,15 . The bottom edge of the rear insert flap 27 rests on the rim 12 of the base part and the bottom edge 32 of the front flap 27 rests on tabs 33 moulded in the front wall 14 of the lid in order to provide the support for the lid and hold the insert in position. The insert 25 may be printed with advertising matter or other information which can be viewed through the transparent lid 2 .
