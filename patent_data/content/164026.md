## Description
CHEMICAL PROCESSThis invention relates to a chemical process and in particular to a process for the resolution of dihydroxyphenyl glycines in order to isolate an optically active dihydroxyphenylglycine. The invention also relates to certain novel intermediates employed in the process.Dihydroxyphenylglycines are a amino acids which are useful as precursors for the synthesis of antibacterially active penicillin and cephalosporin derivatives. As such, the compounds are usually required in a single optically active form, particularly the D form, whereas most synthetic methods for the production of dihydroxyphenylglycines result in the racemic, or DL, form.It has now been found that DL dihydroxyphenylglycines may be separated into their optically active enantiomers by use of the diastereoisomeric salts with 3 bromocamphor 9 sulphonic acid.Accordingly the present invention provides a diastereoisomeric 3 bromocamphor 9 sulphonate salt of a dihydroxyphenylglycine.The compound 3 bromocamphor 9 sulphonic acid is also known as a bromocamphor sulphonic acid, which has on occasions been incorrectly designated as the 8 sulphonic acid. The camphor sulphonate salts of this invention include those having the formula I EMI2.1 The camphorsulphonate salt of formula I may be prepared by treating a racemic dihydroxyphenylglycine of formula 11 EMI2.2 with optically active 3 bromocamphor 9 sulphonic acid of formula III EMI3.1 Suitable solvents for this reaction include polar solvents, such as water, C16 alkanoic acids, such as acetic acid, or dilute mineral acids, such as dilute sulphuric acid.It is preferred to employ the camphorsulphonic acid of formula III in the form of a salt thereof, such as the sodium or potassium salt, and liberate the acid by carrying out the reaction in the presence of a strong mineral acid.The dihydroxy phenylglycines of formula II are known compounds and may be prepared by conventional methods such as reaction of a dihydroxybenzaldehyde with ammonia and hydrogen cyanide followed by hydrolysis or by the process as described in British Patent No.1,371,896.Suitable dihydroxyphenylglycines of formula II include a amino 2,4 dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, a amino 2,5 dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, and a amino 3, 4 dihydroxyphenylacetic acid.When the racemic dihydroxyphenylglycine of formula II is treated with the optically active camphorsulphonic acid, a mixture of two diastereoisomeric camphorsulphonate salts are produced, which have different solubilities. One of these salts is then isolated by preferential crystallisation. It is preferred to carry out the crystallisation in the same solvent as the camphorsulphonate salt is prepared. The isolated salt is then cleaved with a strong acid or base to produce the optically active dihydroxyphenylglycine.Accordingly in a further aspect, this invention provides a process for the preparation of an optically active dihydroxyphenylglycine, which process comprises treating a diastereomeric 3 bromocamphor 9 sulphonate salt of a dihydroxyphenylglycine with a base.Furthermore, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of an optically active dihydroxyphenylglycine which process comprises reacting a racemic dibydroxyphenylglycine with an optically active 3 bromocamphor 9 sulphonic acid to yield two diastereoisomeric salts, isolating one salt by preferential crystallisation, and liberating the optically active dihydroxyphenylglycine therefrom.The diastereoisomeric bromocamphorsulphonate salts are separated by preferential crystallisation. This may be induced by concentration of the solution, by adding a further solvent in which one diastereoisomer is less soluble, such as water or by a seed crystal of the desired diastereoisomer.After separation of the formed crystals the mother liquor can be treated to recover the other diastereoisomeric salt by further recrystallisation, preferebly after addition of a seed crystal of the diastereoisomeric salt remaining in solution in excess. The mother liquor may be conveniently treated with a further quantity of 3 bromocamphor 9 sulphonic acid, whereupon the solution will contain an excess of the diasteroisomeric salt which did not first crystallise, and this salt will now crystallise out on evaporation, though preferably a seed crystal of such salt is added to induce crystallisation.After isolation, the desired diastereoisomeric camphorsulphonate salt is treated with a strong base. Suitable bases are those which are capable of hydrolysing the dihydroxyphenylglycine salt to the dihydroxyphenylglycine, for example bases which are stronger than the dihydroxyphenylglycine, such as ammonia, sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide.The liberated camphorsulphonic acid can be recovered and re used.In the process of this invention, it is preferred to employ the L 3 bromocamphor 9 sulphonic acid, which causes preferential crystallisation of a salt with theD enantiomer of the dihydroxyphenylglycine, the latter being the preferred enantiomer for use in the synthesis of penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics.Since it is the D form of the dihydroxy phenylglycine which finds most use, particularly in the production of useful penicillins and cephalosporins, the L form is not particularly desired. After separation this may be racemised to reform the DL form, for example by treating the compound with hydrochloric acid at high temperature, for example 1300 1400C, whereafter the process of the invention can be repeated to produce quantities of the desired D isomer. The following Examples illustrate this invention.Example 1Precipitation of D 3,4 dihydroxyphenylglycine salt with 3 brooocaipbor 9 sulphonic acid.5g 0.0273 mole of DL 3,4 dihydroxyphenylglycine was slurried in 200 ml of glacial acetic acid at 400C, and 6.80g 0.0219 mole of L 3 bromocamphor 9 sulphonic acid was added. seed crystals of the salt of D 3,4 dihydroxyphenylglycine with L 3 bromo 9 sulphonic acid were added.
