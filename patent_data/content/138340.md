# Testing pellet cladding interaction.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for testing characteristics of in teraction of nuclear fuel pellets 12 with nuclear reactor fuel rod cladding 10 establishes a temperature profile within a nuclear fuel rod which is closely modelled on that found during operation in a nuclear reactor. To this end, high frequency microwave radiation from sources 24, 26 is used to heat the fuel pellets 12 within the cladding 10 , using the cladding itself as a waveguide. Sensors 40, 42 monitor various operating parameters and a water jacket 16 cools the test cladding 10 .
