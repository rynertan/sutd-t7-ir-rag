## Description
REAGENT FOR STREPTOCOCCAL ANTI ESTERASE ASSAY The present invention relates to a reagent for streptococcal anti esterase assay. More particularly, it relates to a novel reagent useful for the determination of an anti esterase antibody, i.e. an antibody against an esterase from pathogenic streptococci. In serodiagnosis of diseases caused by pathogenic streptococcal infections such as rheumatic fever, acute glomerulonephritis and scarlet fever, particulatly in case of the diseases caused by infections of Lancefield s hemolytic group A streptococci, it has, hitherto, been done by determining the titer of an antibody against extracellar components. There have usually been determined the antibody against Streptolysin O ASO and the antibody against deoxyribonuclease B. Antibody against hyaluronidase, streptokinase or NAD nucleosidase is occasionally determined. It has been also reported by Hayano to determine an anti esterase antibody lcf. Seiki Hayano, Infection and Immunity 15 1 , 295 299 1977 . According to this method, the anti esterase antibody and the esterase antigen are spotted on an agar gel plate and subjected to a repetitive counter electrophoresis and then the esterase bound to the anti esterase antibody on the agar gel plate is colored by spraying chromogenic substrate reagent, and the resulting appeared moved spot is measured. The value of anti esterase antibody is determined based on the size of the colored spot. This method is advantageous in that it can be done even in a small amount of test materials and that the gel plate with colored spots can be kept for a long period of time.However, it has such disadvantages as complicated procedures and time consuming about 48 hours , and further, the obtained data are not quantitative rather qualitative because they are determined from the size of spot. The present inventors have intensively studied improvement of the determination of an antibody against an esterase from pathogenic streptococci in human blood serum. As a result, it has been found that the antiesterase antibody can quantitatively be determined within a very short period of time such as about one to two hours with a small amount of a test material by the method comprising adding an esterase obtained from a culture broth of a pathogenic streptococcus and a human blood serum into a test tube, adding thereto an insoluble protein being capable of binding to human immunoglobulin, incubating the mixture, separating the resulting an esterase anti esterase antibody insoluble protein complex, and then determining the esterase activity thereof with a conventional reagent for determining esterase activity, wherein the esterase activity is in a quantitative relation with the amount of the anti esterase antibody in the human blood serum. An object of the present invention is to provide a reagent useful for the improved method for the determination of an antibody against an esterase from pathogenic streptococci, i.e. for streptococcal anti esterase assay. Another object of the invention is to provide an improved method for the determination of the antiesterase antibody which is useful for serodiagnosis of diseases caused by pathogenic streptococcal infections.These and other objects and advantages of the invention will be apparent to persons skilled in the art from the following description. The reagent for streptococcal anti esterase assay of the present invention comprises a kit of the following reagents reagent 1 an esterase a from pathogenic streptococci, reagent 2 a protein b which is capable of binding to an antibody d against the esterase a from pathogenic streptococci and is bound to an insoluble carrier, and reagent 3 a reagent c for measuring an activity of the esterase a . The esterase a reagent 1, which may occasionally be referred to as antigen can be obtained by cultivating a pathogenic streptococcus, fractionating the resulting culture broth containing esterase with ammonium sulfate, subjecting the resulting fraction to dialysis and then to lyophilization. cf.Japanese Patent Laid Open Application No. 132,288 1974 published on December 18, 1974 . The pathogenic streptococci include hemolyticGroup A streptococci e.g. Streptococcus pyogenes 69882, type A 49 and Streptococcus pyogenes T4, type 4 , hemolytic Group B streptococci e.g. Streptococcus sp.H36B, type B I b and Streptococcus pyogenes B III D 136C, type III , or the like. Any other streptococci which are available from various institutes of microorganisms depositories in the world can be used if they have an esterase producing capacity without regard to having hemolytic properties or not. The esterases a are classified into various serological types such as typeA I, type A II, type B, type C, etc. in accordance with the kinds of pathogenic streptococci, and.these various types of esterase can be all used in the present invention.According to the reagent of the present invention, each anti esterase antibody d corresponding to each type of esterase can separately be determined. For example, when the type A I esterase a is used, the anti typeA I esterase antibody d can be determined, but other anti esterase antibodies such as anti type A Il esterase antibody and anti type B esterase antibody can not be determined. In order to determine the anti type A II esterase antibody or anti type B esterase antibody, type A II esterase or type B esterase should be used, respectively. This differential determination of each anti esterase antibody is one of the characteristics of the present invention. It is also possible to determine total value of two or more kinds of anti esterase antibodies by using a mixture of two or more types of esterase as the reagent 1. The protein b which is capable of binding to an anti esterase antibody d and is bound to an insoluble carrier, reagent 2, which may occasionally be referred to as immuno absorbent includes, for example, an antibody against an anti esterase antibody d which is bound to a conventional. insoluble carrier such as bacterial cell walls, glass beads or Saphadexes. The antibody against an anti esterase antibody d may be obtained by administering parenterally the anti esterase antibody d to an animal different from the animal which produced the antibody d , but preferably be obtained by administering parenterally an immunoglobulin of an animal which produced the antibody d to another animal and separating the produced antibody. The antibody against anti esterase antibody d thus obtained is bound to a conventional insoluble carrier e.g. bacterial cell walls with a divalent binding agent e.g. glutaraldehyde . cf. Japanese Patent Laid Open Application No. 117,419 1977, published on October 1, 1977 . As the reagent 2, there can be used cell walls of bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus which contain protein A . The protein A is a protein which can non specifically bind to immunoglobulin cf. ArneForsgren et al, The Journal of Immunology 97, 822 827 1966 . In the bacterial cell walls containing protein A , the moiety of protein A corresponds to the protein being capable of binding to the anti esterase antibody d and the remaining moiety corresponds to the insoluble carrier. The bacterial cell walls containing protein A can be used as they stand, but alternatively, the protein A is isolated and purified and then is bound to an insoluble carrier such as glass beads or Sephadexes.A protein A bound to a Sephadex is commercially available in the name of Protein A Sepharose CL 4B manufactured and sold by Pharmacia, Sweden . The reagent c for determining an activity of the esterase reagent 3 includes all conventional reagents which comprises a substrate for the esterase a and a coloring agent which can react with hydrolyzed products of the substrate to give a color, for example a combination of S acetylthiophenol and 5,5 dithio bis 2 nitrobenzoic acid hereinafter, referrred to as DTNB , a combination of naphthyl acetate and a diazo compound e.g. naphthylamine diazonium chloride , nitrophenyl acetate this compound functions both as a substrate and as a coloring agent , or the like. The reagent 3 may additionally contain other agents such as an enzymatic stopping reagent e.g. acetone or acidic Tris malate buffer pH 5 6 1, a buffering agent e.g. Tris HCl buffer or phosphate buffer , or the like. These reagents 1, 2 and 3 are usually in the form of a kit in the liquid or powder state in accordance with the properties of the reagents. The determination of an anti esterase antibody d in test material by using the reagent of the present invention can be carried out in the following steps. First step antigen antibody reaction The reagent 1, i.e. an esterase a antigen , is added to the test material antibody and is subjected to an antigen antibody reaction to give an antigenantibody complex e . Second step Collection of the antigen antibody complex The antigen antibody complex e is reacted with the reagent 2 immuno absorbent . and the resulting precipitate of the complex e is collected. Third step Measurement of esterase activity The activity of esterase contained in the precipitate obtained in the second step is measured by using the reagent 3. The first step can usually be carried out by mixing the test material with the esterase a preferably in an excess amount in a buffer solution pS 6 8 such as phosphate buffer and incubating the mixture at a temperature of from 20 to 400C, preferably about 370C, for 5 to 40 minutes. The resulting mixture containing an antigen antibody complex e is used in the second step. The second step can usually be carried out by reacting the mixture containing an antigen antibody complex e obtained in the first step with the reagent 2 immuno absorbent in a buffer solution pH 6 8 and incubating the mixture at a temperature of from 20 to 40 C, preferably about 370C, for 5 to 40 minutes, followed by collecting the resulting precipitate by centrifugation or any other conventional separation means. The third step can usually be carried out by reacting the precipitate obtained in the second step with a substrate for the esterase a and then reacting the resultant with a coloring agent, followed by measuring the resulting colored solution in a conventional manner. For example, the precipitate is reacted withS acetylthiophenol substrate and the resulting thiophenol is reacted with DTNB which is a thiol group coloring agent , and the resulting yellow color intensity is measured with a colorimeter. Alternatively, the determination of the antiesterase antibody d can be carried out by exchanging the first step and the second step. That is, the reagent 2 immuno absorbent is firstly added to the test material in a buffer solution pH 6 8 and the mixture is reacted likewise, the resulting precipitate collected by a centirifuge is subjected to the antigenantibody reaction with the reagent 1 and washed by a centrifuge, followed by the measurement of the activity of esterase the third step . Further alternatively, the first and second steps can be done simultaneously. That is, the reagent 1 and the reagent 2 are simultaneously added to the test material in a buffer solution pH 6 8 and the mixture is subjected to the reaction likewise, and the resulting precipitate of antigen antibody complex is collected and subjected to the measurement of the activity of esterase the third step . This alternative method is the most convenient because of the simplest procedure. The results of these three methods are well correlated. The reagent of the present invention is useful for diagnosis of diseases caused by various pathogenic streptococcal infections, particularly hemolytic streptococcal infections. The present invention is illustrated by the following Examples but is not limited thereto. In theExamples, 8 is by weight, unless specified otherwise.

The dialysis was repeated twice. The dialyzed inner solution was adjusted with the same buffer solution to give a protein concentration of 1 g 50 ml. The resulting mixture was mixed with an aqueous suspension 20 ml containing cell walls ofLactobacillus plantarum ATCC 8014 1 g, an insoluble carrier and 1M sodium acetate buffer pH 5.0, 10 ml .To the mixture was gradually added with stirring 0.8 aqueous glutaraldehyde solution 120 ml and the mixture was stirred for additional 2 hours.

The procedure was repeated twice, and the resulting precipitate was collected and added to the same BSA NaCl potassium phosphate buffer as above 100 ml , and the mixture was sonicated again to give a suspension containing bacterial cell wall bound immunoglobulin rabbit antibody an insoluble antibody . The suspension of an insoluble antibody thus obtained was used for the determination of anti esterase antibody in the following Examples.
