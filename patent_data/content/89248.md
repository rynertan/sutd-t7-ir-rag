# Dense mounting of semiconductor chip packages.

## Abstract
A semiconductor device comprises a plurality of leadless packages 6 and a base plate 5 for mounting the leadless packages. Each leadless package comprises a semiconductor chip housed therein and a plurality of electrodes 6a formed on the surface thereof. The base plate comprises conductor patterns formed on both of two main surfaces thereof, and the electrodes of each leadless package are soldered to the conductor patterns. The base plate also comprises a plurality of lead pins 8 which project from one edge thereof in parallel with the main surface. By mounting packages on both sides of the base plate, a high mounting density can be achieved.
