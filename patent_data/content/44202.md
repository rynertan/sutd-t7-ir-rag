# Transmission system.

## Abstract
Transmission system comprising an engine 10 which drives a propeller shaft 14 through continuously variable gearing CVG 11 , split path gearing 12 , and a disconnec tor device 13 . In neutral N or park P operation, the disconnector device 13 receives the drive from the propeller shaft 14 . The speed N₀ of the propeller shaft 14 corresponding to the prevailing setting of the CVG 14 is calculated by circuitry 30 to 34 responsive to speed transducers 25, 26 . The calculated speed N₀ is compared with the actual propeller shaft speed N₀ in a summing circuit 35 , and the output of this circuit provides a control signal via a frequency compensation circuit 36 and an amplifier 49 to an actuator 24 so as to vary the ratio of the CVG 24 to equalise the calculated speed N₀ with the actual speed N₀ .
