# Method for producing amorphous alloy shaped articles.

## Abstract
Amorphous alloy shaped articles having excellent magnetic properties, high hardness and strength, or high corrosion resistance can be obtained by a method, wherein amorphous alloy or atomized alloy raw material powder layer is laminately arranged adjacently to a metal powder layer having a shock impedance a little different from that of the raw material powder layer, and a shock pressure is applied to the raw material powder layer.
