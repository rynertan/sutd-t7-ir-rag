## Description
This invention relates to substituted benzamide derivatives useful as to processes of combating fungal infestations and to fungicidal compositions. Substituted benzamide derivatives have previously been proposed for use as herbicides and fungicides, and for example, the compounds disclosed in European patent applications, publication numbers 59536, 61836 and 76030, may be mentioned as well as UK Patent Publication No. 2152927. We have now found that a certain, related, class of compounds possess appreciably lower phytotoxicity towards plants while maintaining high levels of fungicidal activity. According to the present invention therefore there are provided amide derivatives of the general formula I and tautomeric forms thereof wherein R is a phenyl group substituted in the 4 position by a group R¹XCH₂ , where R¹ is C₁ C₄ alkyl, C₃ C₄ alkenyl, C₃ C₄ alkynyl, C₁ C₄ alkyl carbonyl, or H, and X is oxygen or sulphur E is CN, CSNH₂ or CONH₂ and Y is C₁ C₄ alkoxy, C₃ C₄ alkenyloxy, C₃ C₄ alkynyloxy OR 1 PYRAZOLYL. The structural formula I given above is believed to be the one which best represents the structure of the compounds. For some compounds within the scope of the formula I it may be possible in principle for tautomeric forms of the compound to exist, in which a hydrogen atom is transposed to another part of the molecule and the chemical bonds between the atoms of the molecule are consequently rearranged thus, it is possible in principle for the molecule to exist in the alternative form II The structural formula I is intended to represent and include such tautomeric forms, insofar as they may exist. The structural formula I is also intended to include any physically distinguishable modifications of the compounds which may arise, for example, from different ways in which the molecules are arranged in a crystal lattice, or from the inability of parts of the molecules to rotate freely in relation to other parts, or from geometrical and or optical isomerism, or from intramolecular or intermolecular bonding, or otherwise. In a further, preferred, aspect the invention provides an amide derivative as defined on page 1 wherein, in Formula I, R¹XCH₂ is a C₁ ₄ alkoxymethyl group E is CN or CSNH₂ and Y is 1 pyrazolyl or C₁ ₄ alkoxy. A particularly preferred amide has the formula The invention further provides processes for preparing compounds of formula I above. Thus the compounds may be prepared, for example, by the process of Scheme A below The process outlined schematically in Scheme A above begins with step a , in which an acid chloride RCOCl is reacted with amino acetonitrile by a conventional procedure to obtain the acylaminoacetonitrile derivative III . This is then reacted in step b with a brominating agent for example bromine in glacial acetic acid to give the brominated derivative IV . This bromination procedure also simultaneously hydrates the cyano group to a carbamoyl group CONH₂, and necessitates treatment with a dehydrating agent at a later stage to convert the carbamoyl group back into a cyano group. It may be possible to avoid the undesired conversion of the cyano group to carbamoyl by use of a different solvent or brominating agent and thereby shorten the process by making step d unnecessary. In step c , the bromo compound IV is reacted with an appropriate nucleophile of formula YH to obtain the carbamoyl compound V . Preferably the reaction is carried out in a solvent the solvent should be an aprotic solvent to avoid reaction of the solvent with the bromo compound IV . Preferably an acid acceptor is present in at least a stoichiometric proportion. Examples of acid acceptors include tertiary amines, for example triethylamine and pyridine. The reaction takes place readily even at ambient temperatures but may be accelerated if desired by heating for example to 100 C or above. The intermediate compounds of formula IV and V are novel and constitute a further aspect of the present invention. The final step d of Scheme A is the treatment of the carbamoyl compound V with a dehydrating agent to convert it to the corresponding cyano compound. The dehydrating agent may be, for example, a bi molar amount of A further process for making compounds of the invention is outlined in Scheme B, wherein R² is C₁ C₆ alkyl In step a of Scheme B, an amide RCONH₂ is condensed with a glyoxylic ester HCO COOR² to give the hydroxy intermediate VII . The group R² is an ester radical, for example an alkyl group of 1 to 4 carbon atoms eg. a methyl group . In step b , the hydroxy intermediate VII is treated with a chlorinating agent eg. thionyl chloride to convert it to the chloro derivative VIII . This is in turn reacted in step c with the appropriate nucleophile, YH, to give the ester IX . Treatment of this with ammonia in step d gives the carbamoyl derivative V which may then be converted to the cyano compound of the invention by the method of step d of Scheme A. A further process for making the compounds of the invention is outlined in Scheme C below. According to Scheme C, an amide RCONH₂ is first treated with sodium hydride and the anion so generated is then reacted with an alpha bromo ester Y CH Br COOR² to give the ester X . This is then reacted with ammonia to give the amide V , and finally V is treated with a dehydrating agent to give the nitrile VI . A further method for preparing compounds of the invention is outlined in Scheme D. According to Scheme D III is chlorinated eg. with SO₂Cl₂ or brominated eg. with Br₂ in an aprotic solvent to give the highly reactive bromo or chloro derivative XI . This is treated with the appropriate nucleophile YH in the presence of base to give the required nitrile VI . The chloro or bromo nitriles XI are too unstable to be isolated and characterised, and are used within a short time after they are prepared. The final stage b of the scheme may conveniently be carried out by using an excess of the nucleophile YH, and anhydrous potassium carbonate as the base. Triethylamine or other tertiary amines may also be used as the base. Compounds of the invention in which the group E is a thiocarbamoyl radical may be prepared according to Scheme E below The reaction is conveniently carried out by passing gaseous H₂S through a solution of the nitrile VI in a suitable solvent such as toluene or pyridine containing a little triethylamine as catalyst. Usually the solution is externally cooled to 0 10 . If the product XII does not separate from the solution, it may be isolated by removal of the solvent. The amide derivatives of formula I, and compositions containing them, are variously active against a wide range of fungal diseases, particularly, for example, against A particularly valuable feature of the activity of the amide derivatives is their systemic effect, ie. their ability to move in a plant to combat an infection or infestation remote from the site of initial application. Thus a derivative, or a composition containing it, may be applied to the soil surrounding the roots of a plant or to the seed or to other plant areas, eg. leaves, and be taken up by the plant through its roots, or other areas, to combat fungi locally or elsewhere on the plants. In another aspect, therefore, the invention provides a process for combatting fungi, especially of inhibiting the growth of fungi on plants, which comprises applying to the plants, or the locus thereof, a fungicidally effective amount of a compound of the formula I as hereinbefore defined. The amount of the compound may vary, depending upon the identity of the particular compound chosen, the fungal species whose growth is to be inhibited, and the plant or locus involved. The skilled worker in the fungicide art will readily be able to establish appropriate application rates by standard procedures without undue experimentation. Preferred compounds for use in the fungicidal compositions of the invention and the process for combatting fungi are those defined in detail above with reference to formula I wherein R is optionally substituted phenyl, especially 4 methoxymethylphenyl, Y is pyrazolyl and E is CN or CSNH₂. The compounds used in the process and compositions of the invention are preferably applied in the form of a composition, in which the active ingredient is mixed with a carrier comprising a solid or liquid diluent. In another aspect, therefore, the invention provides a fungicidal composition, comprising as an active ingredient a compound of the formula I as hereinbefore defined, in admixture with a solid or liquid diluent. Preferably the composition also comprises a surface active agent. The amide derivatives may be used as such for anti fungal purposes but are more conveniently formulated into compositions for such usage. The invention also provides fungicidal compositions comprising as active ingredient an amide derivative as defined in any of the paragraphs above. The amide derivatives and compositions containing them can be used to combat plant fungi and treat plants or seeds in a number of ways, for example they can be applied, formulated or unformulated, directly to the foliage of a plant which is infected or likely to become infected, or they can be applied also to bushes and trees, to soil or to other medium in which plants, bushes or trees are growing or to be planted, or they can be sprayed on, dusted on or applied as a cream or paste formulation. Application can be to any part of the plant, bush or tree, for example to the foliage, stems, branches, seeds or roots, or to the soil surrounding the roots. The terms combatting and treatment as used herein embrace all the foregoing modes of application and the term plant includes seedlings, bushes and trees. Furthermore, the method of the invention includes protectant, prophylactic and eradicant treatment. The derivatives are preferably used for agricultural and horticultural purposes in the form of compositions. The type of composition used in any instance will depend upon the particular purpose envisaged. The compositions may be in the form of dusting powders or granules, for example ordinary grains or slow release granules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with a solid diluent or carrier, for example, kaolin, bentonite, kieselguhr, dolomite, calcium carbonate, talc, powdered magnesia, Fuller s earth, gypsum, Hewitt s earth, diatomaceous earth and China clay. Compositions for dressing seed may, for example, comprise an agent for example a mineral oil for assisting the adhesion of the composition to the seed. The compositions may also be in the form of dispersible powders or grains comprising a wetting agent to facilitate the dispersion in liquids of the powder or grains which may contain also fillers and suspending agents. The aqueous dispersion of emulsions may be prepared by dissolving the active ingredient s in an organic solvent which may contain wetting, dispersing or emulsifying agent s and then adding the mixture so obtained to water which may also contain wetting, dispersing or emulsifying agent s . Suitable organic solvents are ethylene dichloride, isopropyl alcohol, propylene glycol, diacetone alcohol, toluene, kerosene, methylnaphthalene, xylenes and trichloroethylene. The compositions for spraying may also be in the form of aerosols wherein the formulation is held in a propellant, eg. fluorotrichloromethane or dichlorodifluoromethane. By including suitable additives, for example additives for improving the distribution, adhesive power and resistance to rain on treated surfaces, the different compositions can be better adapted for various utilities. The derivatives can be used in smoke generators and also as mixtures with fertilisers eg. nitrogen or phosphorus containing fertilisers . Compositions comprising only granules of fertiliser incorporating, for example coated with, the derivative, are preferred. The invention therefore also provides a fertiliser composition comprising the derivative and a fertiliser. The compositions may also be in the form of liquid preparations for use as dips or sprays which are generally aqueous dispersions or emulsions containing the active ingredient in the presence of one or more surface active agent s , dispersing agent s , emulsifying agent s or anionic or non ionic agents. Suitable cationic agents are quaternary ammonium compounds for example, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide. Suitable anionic agents are soaps, salts of aliphatic monoesters of sulphuric acid for example sodium lauryl sulphate , and salts of sulphonated aromatic compounds for example sodium dodecylbenzene sulphonate, sodium, calcium or ammonium lignosulphonate, butylnaphthalene sulphonate, and a mixture of sodium di isopropyl and triisopropylnaphthalene sulphonates . Suitable non ionic agents are the condensation products of ethylene oxide with fatty alcohols such as oleyl alcohol or cetyl alcohol, or with alkyl phenols such as octylphenol, nonylphenol and octylcresol. Other non ionic agents are the partial esters derived from long chain fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, the condensation products of the said partial esters with ethylene ocide, and the lecithins. Suitable suspending agents are hydrophilic colloids for example polyvinylpyrrolidone and sodium carboxymethylcellulose , and the vegetable gums for example gum acacia and gum tragacanth . The compositions for use as aqueous dispersions or emulsions are generally supplied in the form of a concentrate containing a high proportion of the active ingredient s , the concentrate to be diluted with water before use. These concentrates often should be able to withstand storage for prolonged periods and after such form aqueous preparations which remain homogenous for a sufficient time to enable them to be applied by conventional spray equipment. The concentrates may conveniently contain 10 85 , generally 25 60 , by weight of the active ingredient s . When diluted to form aqueous preparations, such preparations may contain varying amounts of the active ingredient s depending upon the intended purpose, but an aqueous preparation containing 0.0005 or 0.01 to 10 by weight of active ingredient s may be used. The compositions of this invention can comprise also other compound s having biological activity, eg. compounds having similar or complementary fungicidal or plant growth regulating activity or compounds having herbicidal or insecticidal activity. The other fungicidal compound can be for example one which is capable of combating ear diseases of cereals eg. wheat such as Suitable insecticides are pirimor, croneton, dimethoate, metasystox, formothion, and pyrethroid compounds. The other plant growth regulating compound can be one which controls weeds or seedhead formation, improves the level or longevity of the plant growth regulating activity of the compounds of general formula I , selectively controls the growth of the less desirable plants eg. grasses or causes the compound of general formula I to act faster or slower as a plant growth regulating agent. Some of these other agents will be herbicides. Examples of suitable agents are the gibberellins eg. GA₃, GA₄ or GA₇ , the auxins eg. indoleacetic acid, indolebutyric acid, naphthoxyacetic acid or naphthylacetic acid , the cytokinins eg. kinetin, diphenylurea, benzimidazole, benzyladenine or BAP , phenoxyacetic acids eg. 2,4 D or MCPA , substituted benzoic acids eg.

This Example illustrates a composition according to the invention which comprises an emulsifiable concentrate. The following ingredients were thoroughly mixed to give a solution. A composition in the form of grains readily dispersible in a liquid, eg. water, was prepared by grinding together the first three ingredients in the presence of added water and then mixing in the sodium acetate. The resultant mixture was dried and passed through a British Standard mesh sieve, size 44 100, to obtain the desired size of grains. The following ingredients were ground together to produce a powder formulation readily dispersible in liquids. The active ingredient was dissolved in acetone and the resultant liquid was sprayed on to the granules of china clay. The solvent was then allowed to evaporate to produce a granular composition. A composition suitable for use as a seed dressing was prepared by mixing the following three ingredients. A dusting powder was prepared by mixing the active ingredient with talc. A Col formulation was prepared by ball milling the constituents set out below and then forming an aqueous suspension of the ground mixture with water. A dispersible powder formulation was made by mixing together the ingredients set out below and then grinding the mixture until all were thoroughly mixed. This Example illustrates the preparation of a dispersible powder formulation. The ingredients were mixed and the mixture then ground in a comminution mill. The ingredients set out below were formulated into a dispersible powder by mixing then grinding the ingredients. In Examples 5 to 14 the proportions of the ingredients given are by weight and the Examples were all repeated using, as active ingredient, the other compounds of Table I. There now follows an explanation of the compositions or substances represented by the various Trade Marks and Trade Names mentioned above. The compounds were tested against a variety of mainly foliar fungal diseases of plants. The techniques were as follows For all tests, plants were grown in John Innes Potting Compost No 1 or 2 in 4cm diameter minipots. The test compounds were formulated either by bead milling with aqueous Dispersol T or as a solution in acetone or acetone ethanol which was diluted to the required concentration immediately before use. For the foliar diseases, solutions and suspensions 100ppm ai were sprayed on the foliage and applied to the roots of the plant via the soil. The sprays were applied to maximum retention and the root drenches to a final concentration equivalent to approximately 40ppm ai dry soil. Tween 20, to give a final concentration of 0.05 , was added when the sprays were applied to cereals ai means active ingredient . Most were protectant tests where the compound was applied to the soil and roots and to the foliage one or two days before the plant was inoculated with the pathogen. However, in the case of the test against The foliar pathogens were applied by spraying spore suspensions onto the leaves of the test plants. After inoculation, the plants were placed in an appropriate environment to allow infection to proceed and then incubated until the disease was ready for assessment. The period between inoculation and assessment varied from four to fourteen days according to the disease and the environment. Disease control was recorded using the following grading system The results are shown in Table II below. The key to the disease headings in Table II is as follows Vine seedlings growing in 7cm pots were sprayed to run off with the test chemicals. After 9 days the plants received a second spray with the test chemicals. After treatment the plants were kept in a growth room 21 C day 18 C night 60 RH day 95 RH night 16 hour day length. Eleven days after the second spray growth and phytotoxicity was assessed using arbitrary grades 0 5, where 0 no damage and 5 plant dead. The results are shown in the Table below. The test was assessed 11 days after the second spray and there was a 9 days interval between sprays. It can be concluded from this test that compound No 2 of Table I is appreciably less phytotoxic than prior art compounds A or B, particularly at the critical concentration of around 50ppm. The structures of prior art compounds A and B are shown below The above two compounds are disclosed in EP Patent Publication No 76030.
