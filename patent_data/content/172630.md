# Sewing machine attachment.

## Abstract
The sewing machine attachments of this invention include an arm 56 that is pivotally mounted and controlled by a pneumatic motor 58 whereby the arm 56 can be pivotally moved relative to the sewing machine. In one embodiment, the outer end of the arm is provided with gripping apparatus 38 , 40 arranged to receive and hold an overlay 36 . Upon pivotal movement of the arm 56 , the overlay 36 is placed in position on the workpiece and held there by the presser foot 30 of the sewing machine so that the overlay 36 can be sewed to the workpiece. In another embodiment, the outer end of the arm is provided with gripping apparatus and with folding blades so that an overlay placed therein can have edges thereof folded and gripped by the gripping apparatus. Upon pivotal movement of the arm, the folded overlay is deposited adjacent to the workpiece and held there by the presser foot while the overlay is sewed on the workpiece.
