# Fluid flowmeter and method of measuring flow rate.

## Abstract
A flowmeter which is connectable in series with a fluid supply line and which functions to meter the rate of fluid flow through the supply line. The flowmeter incorporates a chamber 19 into a through which fluid is passed, and an acousto electrical transducer 24 is located within the cham ber for exposure to acoustical energy which is emitted by fluid passing through the chamber 19 . The transducer 24 is connected in circuit with a detector 32 which is arranged to provide an output which follows the peak voltage of an amplified output signal generated by the transducer 24 as a consequence of the transducer 24 being exposed to acoustical energy of the fluid. A display device 34 is incorporated in the flowmeter for providing a measure of the detector output, and hence of the amplitude of the transduc er output, in terms of fluid flow rate.
