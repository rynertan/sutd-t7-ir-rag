# Oxime derivatives and processes of forming polymeric oximes.

## Abstract
Polymeric oxime and derivatives thereof are made by poly merizing a hydrogen blocked oxime derivative having the for mula CH₂ L N O Z wherein R is hydrogen, lower alkyl, aryl, aralkyl or alkaryl, R¹ is hydrogen or lower alkyl, L is a divalent organic linking group and Z is a hydrogen blocking group capable of being replaced by a hydrogen atom. The monomer and the polymer are new materials. Gen erally the hydrogen blocking groups Z are replaced with hydro gen atoms as a subsequent step in the process.
