# Purification of cyanuric acid.

## Abstract
Cyanuric acid is mechanically separated such as by filtration, centrifugation, or centrifugal filtration from a slurry of cyanuric acid, urea, biuret, and an inert solvent in which the urea is soluble at temperatures above about 170 C to reduce the urea content of the recovered solid cyanuric acid. The biuret and solvent content of the solid cyanuric acid is also reduced.
