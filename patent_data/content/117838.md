## Description
The present invention relates to an improvement in an injection molding method. Heretofore, coating the surfaces of synthetic resins with inorganic materials such as metals has widely been carried out with the aims of giving a metallic appearance and conductivity to them and increasing their mechanical properties wear resistance, hardness, bending strength, impact strength, etc., thermal resistance, weathering resistance, water absorption properties and hygroscopicity, corrosion resistance and the like. However, coating methods which have conventionally been utilized for injection molded articles of the synthetic resins are based on applying, to the surfaces of the injection molded resins, depositions in a broad sense dipping process, metal spraying, spattering, vacuum deposition, chemical plating, electric plating, etc. In these methods above, however, it has been necessary to etch the plastic surfaces with the intention of providing metallic coatings with an anchor effect, as shown inFigure 1 attached here, alternatively other treatments have been required, for the purpose of preventing a peeling phenomenon which will occur due to a shearing force between a deposited metallic layer and a plastic matrix on the basis of a temperature change, which shearing force will result from a difference of a thermal expansion coefficient between the metallic layer and the plastic matrix. When it is contemplated to plate the plastics which are non conductive, combination methods of a chemical plating and an electroplating have prevalently been utilized. One example of these methods is set forth in Table 1 below.

For this reason, the development of simple methods has been desired by which an inorganic material coating such as a metal is deposited on the surface of the synthetic resin, and such a desire has been particularly strong for articles which can be mass produced. The present invention which is here suggested can eliminate drawbacks of the aforementioned conventional methods.

Further, according to the present invention, there are provided injection molded articles of a synthetic resin having the surface of an inorganic material such as a metal, the inorganic material surface being provided, on its side contiguous to the synthetic resin, with coarse pores which have been formed by spraying, thereby providing the synthetic resin with an anchor effect.

Further,Figures 9 and 10 are photographs exhibiting hundredfold enlarged sectional views of the structures corresponding to Figures 7 and 8, respectively. Next, reference to the function of the present invention will be made. In the injection molding machine illustrated in Figure 2, the synthetic resin material is fed to the cylinder 8 through the feeding member 7, and is molten by the heater 14 while forwarded by the screw 6 in the cylinder 8. The molten material is then injected into a space between the molds 10 and 11 by force of the hydraulic cylinder 4. After its cooling and hardening, the core mold 11 is moved so as to separate from the cavity mold 10, and the molded synthetic resin article 16 is then removed therefrom. In the instance where the present invention is concerned, the inorganic material is sprayed toward a predetermined position of the mold in the aforesaid process, with the molds 10 and 11 opened. Subsequently, the injection molding operation just described is carried out, thereby integrally associating the inorganic material with the molded synthetic resin article. The molded synthetic resin articles obtained according to the present invention can be fed to fields where features of the inorganic material are utilized. For example, as shown in Figures 5 and 6 above, molding the synthetic resin article so that it may be integrally associated with the sprayed inorganic material layer is carried out as follows First, as seen inFigure 4, the parting agent 21 such as a clear lacquer, colloidal silica or the like is sprayed, as thick as several microns, onto the cavity mold 10 to form a coating thereon, and the inorganic material 20a is sprayed over the thus formed parting agent coating in order to form a disc like thin plate on the mold surface with the interposition of the parting agent coating. At the next step, the cavity mold 10 and the core mold 11 are closed airtightly, and the synthetic resin is injected thereinto and molded to prepare an article integrally associated with the inorganic material, which is then removed therefrom. Generally, in such a case an adhesion between the sprayed inorganic layer and the synthetic resin is substantially bad. That is to say, with regard to the sprayed simple and smooth inorganic layer which has not undergone any particular control as in conventional cases, it does not adhere sufficiently to the synthetic resin layer, with the result that a shearing stress occurs between both the layers by force of a deformation due to a stress or by a difference of a thermal expansion coefficient between the respective materials at the time of a temperature change, so that a peeling phenomenon tends to appear on the resin layer. In the present invention, for the purpose of preventing this trouble, the fine spraying of the inorganic material is accomplished toward the mold side, i.e. the front side of the injection molded article, as shown in Figure 8, and the rough spraying of the inorganic material is done toward the side which will be in contact with the synthetic resin, as shown in Figure 7. At this time, the synthetic resin generally gets into open cell clearances of approximately 0.05 mm or more, but does not penetrate through pores fines than this size, depending on the employed synthetic resin material, desired article shape and injection molding conditions an injection temperature, pressure, mold temperature, etc. .Therefore, into such coarse pores e.g., 0.05 to 0.1 mm in size as seen in the photograph of Figure 9, the synthetic resin can sufficiently stream and can be joined to the sprayed inorganic material layer with a strong anchor effect on the rugged surface of the inorganic layer. Incidentally, the sprayed coarse inorganic material surface shown inFigure 9 appears to be easily destroyed, but the joining strength between the inorganic layer and the resin layer is enough great, because they are combined with each other on the basis of their stereostructure. As the inorganic materials to be sprayed, there can be utilized metallic materials Fe, Al, Cu, Zn, Sn, alloys thereof, etc. , ceramics A1203, Six2, TiO, WC, Cur02, ZrO,TiC, etc. and cermets in compliance with uses, but it is preferred that differences between melting points and hardnesses of the mold surface and the sprayed inorganic material are large for purposes of holding down, to a low level, the roughness of the sprayed inorganic material layer surface on the side of the mold and permitting the life span of the mold to lengthen. When in a certain combination of the layers, these differences just described are great according to experiments, when copper is sprayed to the steel mold having alloy tools , the sprayed inorganic material will be hard to adhere to the mold surface. Therefore, the inorganic layer with which the synthetic resin is integrally associated can be separated from the mold surface without using any parting agent. It is thus fair to say that some inorganic materials to be sprayed permit omitting such a parting agent as shown in Figure 4. As means for the spraying, there can be employed wire arc spraying, or flame spraying, electric arc spraying, plasma spraying and the like for powdery materials in compliance with the kinds of inorganic materials to be sprayed. The formation of the sprayed rough inorganic layer can usually be accomplished by virtue of the increase in a feeding rate of the inorganic material to the spraying means, the drop in a melting temperature and the extension of a distance from the spraying means a tip of its nozzle to a thing onto which the inorganic material will be sprayed, on the basis of spray conditions of the fine layer which void volume is within the range of 4 to 10 . Proper conditions of the rough layer formation can be set taking, into consideration, a balance of a strength and a roughness of the sprayed inorganic material layer. Further, a range and a shape of the inorganic material spraying in the mold can be determined in the same masking manner as in the case of conventional painting techniques.Furthermore, the roughness on the coarse inorganic layer which has been described above varies with kinds of synthetic resins and conditions of the injection molding, therefore it is not limited to the above specified numerical values. In short, the satisfactory roughness is such that the synthetic resin gets into the pores on the rough surface of the sprayed inorganic layer in order to provide the resin with the anchor effect.
