## Description
The present invention relates to a burst signal generating method and apparatus for use in a time division multiple access TDMA communication system and, more particularly, to an apparatus for generating FSK frequency shift keying or FM frequency modulation burst signals. FSK or FM burst signal generating apparatuses so far proposed include the Burst Signal Transmission System by K. Watanabe see EP A 0,110,368 published on June 13, 1984 . This system includes an FSK or FM modulator and a high power HP amplifier comprising a preamplifier and a non linear power amplifier Class C amplifier which are sequentially connected. To expand the dynamic range of the HP amplifier, the preamplifier is prebiased. This permits an FSK or FM burst signal to have gently sloped leading and trailing edges. However, this prebiasing invites leaking of the carrier wave from the modulator to the output of the HP amplifier, even during the pauses of burst signals. Therefore, sufficient isolation has to be achieved by a control circuit consisting of an attenuator, which is provided between the modulator and the HP amplifier. Sufficient suppression of the carrier wave in a control circuit, especially of a carrier wave in the UHF band or an even higher frequency region, is achieved by cascade connection of a plurality of PIN diodes. This connecting structure invites an increase in insertion loss, and has disadvantages in power efficiency and cost. Furthermore, the reference waveform burst envelope waveform generator circuit included in the system proposed by Watanabe is a digital circuit, which successively reads data out of a read only memory ROM by clock pulses and, after converting them into analog signals with a digital analog converter, filters the converted data to generate the intended envelope. Such a digital envelope generator circuit, since it is generally required to operate at high speed, consumes much power and, as it also needs such peripheral circuits as a latching circuit and a digital analog converter, requires a large packaging space, resulting in a bulky configuration. EP A 0 066 839 shows a digital burst signal transmission system in which a burst carrier wave having gently sloped leading and trailing edges is obtained using a band pass filter which filters the output of a gate circuit said gate circuit switches on and off a local oscillation signal in response to a burst control signal. A frequency converter frequency mixes a modulated signal from a modulator and the filtered signal to produce a modulated RF carrier wave and supply it to an amplifier. The amplified RF carrier wave from the amplifier is switched on and off by a gate circuit in response to the burst control signal. The frequency converted signal has carrier leakage in the vicinity of the leading and trailing edges thereof and this carrier leakage is eliminated by the gate circuit. Since said gate circuit is inserted in an RF band, the number of its switching elements is greater than that of switching elements used in an IF band, resulting in greater insertion loss. An object of the present invention, therefore, is to provide a burst signal generating apparatus whose carrier wave has a certain envelope, permitting ready suppression of the carrier wave during the pauses of burst signals. Another object of the invention is to provide a burst signal generating apparatus with a reduced number of PIN diodes used in the high frequency region. Still another object of the invention is to provide a burst signal generating apparatus using a class C amplifier, which is highly efficient, yet has wide dynamic ranges, and is virtually free of carrier wave leaks. Yet another object of the invention is to provide a burst signal generating apparatus comprising an envelope generator circuit which consumes little power and is small in circuit dimensions. These objects are solved with the features of the claims. These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the detailed description hereunder taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, wherein Referring to Fig. 1 showing a conventional burst signal generating apparatus, a high frequency input signal fed to an input terminal 11 is supplied by way of a gain control circuit 12 to a high power HP amplifier 13, where the signal is power amplified and sent out to an output terminal 14. The HP amplifier 13 comprises a preamplifier and a non linear amplifier Class C amplifier . To expand a dynamic range of the HP amplifier 13, the preamplifier is prebiased. The amplified output With the apparatus described above, with respect to the control signal Now, preferred embodiments of the invention will be described in detail. In Fig. 3, the same components as in Fig. 1 are represented by respectively the same numerals. An input terminal 11, to which high frequency signals are supplied, is connected to a gain control circuit 21, and a gain controlled signal from the gain control circuit 21 is coupled to a power amplifier circuit 13, from which a burst signal A feature of the present invention here resides in that the burst control signal Figs. 4A to 4C are waveform diagrams illustrating the operations of the embodiment shown in Fig. 3. Since the operation of the modulator circuit 19 is controlled in accordance with the control signal Generally the lower the frequency at which a switching circuit is used, the smaller the losses when the switching circuit is closed and the smaller the leaks when it is open. Thus, if a diode switch is to be composed for the radio frequency carrier wave as in the conventional embodiment illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2, many diodes will have to be connected in series because there will be signal leaks attributable to the capacity between electrodes even when the circuit is open. In contrast, in order to achieve switching in a stage where the signal frequency is low as in the present embodiment, the leaks during the open phase of the circuit can be kept sufficiently small even if diodes of the same capacity between electrodes are used. Therefore, the number of required diodes is reduced only one in this example , and their losses during the closed phase of the circuit can also be reduced. Because of the low frequency at which the switching circuit is used, the diodes need not be expensive ones, resulting in a significantly low cost of the switching circuit. As hitherto described, by providing a modulator circuit which accomplishes switching in the intermediate frequenty region with a burst control signal, there is realized the remarkable advantage of simplifying, reducing the cost of and saving the power consumption of the circuit, wherein the carrier wave can be sufficiently suppressed during the pauses of bursts. An unmodulated intermediate frequency carrier wave may be switched with the burst control signal Next will be described in detail the envelope generator circuit 17. Referring to Fig. 5, the envelope generator circuit 17 includes an input terminal 101 for receiving the control signal The operation of the envelope generator circuit 17 will now be described with reference to Figs. 6A to 6D. The reactangular shaped burst control signal To describe its operation in further detail, to the output of the integrator circuit 102 is connected the depletion type field effect transistor 113 as illustrated, i.e., with its gate connected to one end of the differentiating resistor 116, its source to one end each of the low resistance resistor 114 and the high resistance resistor 112, and its drain to the other end of the high resistance resistor 112, the output of the integrator circuit 102 and the input of the low pass filter 104. Therefore, when the control signal In a period of time t2 when the gate bias of the field effect transistor 113 becomes gradually shallower and then zero V, the channel resistance of the transistor 113 becomes relatively small because the field effect resistor 113 is of a depletion type, with the result that the discharging effect is accelerated with a time constant of t2 and the inclination is made steeper. Further as the pulse Since this invention enables an envelope to be generated by a simple circuit with little power consumption as described above, it has the advantage of economizing the hardware, compared with similar apparatuses of the prior art. Now will be described another preferred embodiment of the envelope generator circuit 17. Referring to Fig. 7, this envelope generator circuit 17 comprises an input terminal 101 for receiving the burst control signal The rectangular shaped burst signal Then, when the burst signal Therefore, by taking out the voltages at the two ends of the capacitor 206 as output, a burst waveform Since this invention enables an envelope to be generated by a simple circuit with little power consumption as described above, it has the advantage of economizing the circuit, compared with similar circuits of the prior art.
