# Output control of short circuit welding power source.

## Abstract
A method for controlling the output of a power source in consumable electrode arc welding in which a short circuiting phase and an arcing phase alternately take place between a consumable electrode and a workpiece in a shielding gas atmosphere, the method being characterized by repetition of a cycle of operation consisting of a first stage of maintaining the output welding current at a first value of a relatively low level upon establishment of a short circuit across a gap between a consumable electrode and a workpiece a second stage of maintaining the welding current at a second value of a relatively high level succeedingly to the first stage a third stage of lowering the welding current to a third value of a low level upon detection of necking as a premonition of rupture of short circuiting molten metal between the electrode and workpiece a fourth stage of, upon generation of an arc across a gap between the electrode and workpiece subse quent to the third stage, maintaining tne welding current at a fourth value of a relatively high level exceeding the value of average welding current, and a fifth stage of maintaining the welding current at a fifth value of a relatively low level until the gap between the electrode and workpiece is short circuited, under control of substantially constant current characteristics to feed current of constant level irrepsective of variations in arc length.
