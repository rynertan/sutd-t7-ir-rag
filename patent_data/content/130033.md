# Double eccentric wave generator arrangement.

## Abstract
A double eccentric wave generator assembly for a strain wave gearing assembly having a circular spline 39 and a flexible spline 30 coaxially mounted each having matable gear teeth, a deflection means mounted within said flexspline, said deflection means comprising a pair of wave generating discs 62, 66 journalled on eccentric hubs 60, 64 on a sleeve 40 . The discs 62, 66 are non parallel with one another so as to present an outer periphery which is parallel to the flexspline 30 when it is coned during deflection thereof. A third disc 74 is disposed on the sleeve to provide shape control to the flexspline across its minor axis during rotation thereof.
