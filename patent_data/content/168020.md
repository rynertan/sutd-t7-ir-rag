## Description
TITLE PLL1ORINATED THERMOPLASTIC ELASTOMER COMPOSITIONS FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to fluorinated thermoplastic elastomer compositions which contain two phases, namely a continuous fluorinated crystalline thermoplastic phase and a disperses fluorinated amorphous elastomeric phase. The compositions nay be produced by melt blending the fluorinated thermoplastic and an uncured iiuorinatea amorphous elastomeric polymer, and then dynamically curing the uncured fluorinated polymer to form elastomeric particles which are dispersed in the fluorinated thermoplastic. The compositions may also be produced by latex blending.The compositions of this invention have the highly desirable property of low compression set, that is when articles maae of the composition are compressed for long perioas of time even at high temperatures they have a strong tendency to return to their original size and shape.Another advantage of the compositions of the invention is that flash, or defective parts can be reprocessed without difficulty. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Two phase compositions of a continuous phase thermoplastic polymer and dispersed phase elastomer produced by dynamically curing the elastomer while it is dispersed in the thermoplastic are known. See for example, Coran et al. U.S. Patents 4,348,502, 4,130,535, 4,173,556, 4,207,404 and 4,409,365. Fluorinated and partially fluorinated crystalline thermoplastics are high volume commercial products. Such plastics often contain large amounts of the polymerized monomer, tetrafluoroethylene.Likewise, fluorinated and partially fluorinated amorphous elastomers are known high volume commercial products. Such elastomers induce the cured vulcanized or crosslinked copolymers of vinylidene fluoride with hexafluoropropylene and the like. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention in a two phase composition having a continuous phase consisting essentially of a crystalline thermoplastic fluorocarbon resin, and a dispersed phase which consists essentially of an amorphous cured crosslinkea or vulcanized fluoroelastomer. The dispersed phase constitutes 50 to 90 percent by weight of the two phase composition. The two phase composition of the invention may be prepared by the process of the invention. Trite process of the invention comprises melt blending tne thermoplastic crystalline fluorocarbon resin, ana the uncured amorphous fluoroelastomer, at a temperature above the crystalline melting point of the resin, ana then dynamically curing the elastomer. Dynamically curing means curing while the blena is undergoing mixing, stirring and shear. The curing is carried out by introducing one or more curing agents or free radical sources to the melt blend, and maintaining the temperature at a high enough level that the elastomer crosslinks. The compositions of this invention may be chopped into injection molding granules, and injection molded in a conventional injection molding machine. The compositions can also be compression molded, or extrusion molded. DETAILED DESCRIPTION The thermoplastic crystalline fluorocarton resins useful in compositions of the present invention must be melt processable . By melt processable we mean a polymer whose melt flow can be measured in an extrusion plastometer VAST D 1238, D 2l16 at a temperature above the crystalline melting point of the polymer. Polytetrafluoroethylene cannot be processed by the usual methods of thermoplastic fabrication because of its viscoelastic properties, as describe in ASTMD 1457. Polytetrafluoroethylene is not melt processable. Generally, the thermoplastic crystalline fluorocarbon resin will contain a minimum of 38 percent by weight fluorine. Further the thermoplastic crystalline fluorocarbon resin should be melt processable at a temperature below tnat at which degradation of the amorphous fluorocarbon elastomer occurs to any significant degree.The thermoplastic crystalline fluorocarbon resins useful in the compositions of this invention include a copolymers of tetrafluoroethylene and ethylene, copolymers of tetrafluoroethylene and hexafluoropropylene, copolymers of tetrafluoroethylene and perfluoro propyl vinyl ether and copolymers of tetrafluoroethylene and perfluorobutyl ethylene, b homopolymers of vinylidene fluoride as well as copolymers of vinylidene fluoride in which the vinylidene fluoride is the greatly predominant polymerized monomer, c copolymers of chlorotrifluoroethylene with ethylene or halogenated monomers. Such polymers are well known in the art and many are commercially available. The elastomeric components of the compositions of this invention are also well known in the art and most are commercially available. Suitable elastomeric components include, copolymers of vinylidene fluoride and hexafluoropropylene, terpolymers of tetrafluoropropylene, vinylidene fluoride and hexafluoropropylene, terpolymers of hexafluoropropylene, vinylidene fluoride and bromotetrafluorobutene l, polymers of tetrafluoroethylene, vinylidene fluoride, hexafluoropropylene, bromotetrafluorobutene l, and trimethylallylisocyanurate, also known as 1,3,5 trimethallyl 1,3,5 triazine 2,4,6 H, 3H, 5H trione terpolymers of hexafluoropropylene, vinylidene fluoride and iodotetrafluorobutene l, ana terpolymers of tetrafluoroethylene perfluoromethyl perfluorovinyl ether andEMI4.1 Such elastomers usually haVe molecular weights prior to curing such that they have a Mooney viscosity of about 30 to 200 tML 10 at 1000C . The elastomeric component of the composition of the present invention generally will contain a minimum of 58 percent by weight fluorine. The elastomer phase of the composition of the invention may be cured with conventional curing systems known for curing fluoroelastomers, such as combinations of a magnesium oxide, Bisphenol AF and organophosphonium salts b magnesium oxide, the dipotassium salt of Bisphenol AF and dicyclohexyl 18 Crown 6 c 2,5,dimethyl 2,5 ditertbutylperoxyhexyne 3 sold as Luperco 13Ãº XL 45 active ingredient on a solid support with meta phenylenebismaleimide or triallyl isocyanurate, d cumene hydroperoxide and maleimide or l,3,5 triallyl 1,3,5 triazine 2,4,6 lH,3H,5H trione also known as triallyl isocyanurate. The compositions of the invention contain about 50 to 90 percent by weight of the cured elastomeric component, preferably about o0 to 80 percent by weight, the remaining portion of the composition being the thermoplastic crystalline fluorocarbon resin. The composition of the invention may contain fillers, antioxidants, stabilizers, pigments, processing aids, and the like in amounts conventionally added to fluorocarbon thermoplastics of the art. The particle size of dispersed phase of the compositions of the invention covers a wioe range, and depends among other things on the processing conditions under which the compositions were prepared, the amount of each component in the compositions, the viscosity of each component in the composition. In general more desirable physical properties are obtained with tne compositions of tne invention having greater than 50 percent of the weight of the elastomeric particles smaller than about 3 micrometers. A preferred method of preparing the compositions of the invention is by mixing the components in a extruder or mixer at a temperature above the crystalline melting point of the crystalline component, and then adding the curing agent while continuing the mixing. The temperature of the mixture after the addition of the curing agent may be increased to speed up the reaction. The mixture may be removed from the mixing device prior to completion of the curing reaction if desired, provided the temperature is maintained at a level sufficiently thigh to complete the curing reactions.The mixing of the components is best carriea out at temperatures above about 2000C, ana the curing is best carried out at above about 2500C. The compositions of the invention may also be prepared by mixing a latex of the elastomeric component containing the selected curing agent with a suspension of the thermoplastic component. The polymer suspension is then filtered out dried and cured. The curing may take place during molding if desired. In the following examples which illustrate the invention, all parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise specified. Examples 1 9 Details of formulations and properties are provided in Table 1. Procedure for Examples 1 to 7 The amorphous elastomer designatea 1 inTable 1 employed was a commercial high viscosity copolymer of vinylidene fluoride, 60 , and hexafluoropropylene 40 . The elastomer was charged to Brabender Plastograph at about 2000, 40 rpm rotor speed and masticated while the thermoplastic resin was added at 200 2500C. The temperature was then raised to 290 320 C, under nitrogen, and mastication continued at 90 rpm until an unicorn melt was obtained. The temperature was then droppea to 2900C, while fillers if any and curing agents were added in the order listed in Table I. Mastication was continued at 2900 3000C for 15 mins. after te last ingredient was added.In Examples 2, 3, 5 ana 7 the products became powder on the addition of magnesium oxide. The product was then removed from the mixer and placed in a tray for transfer to an air oven whereon it was heated at 2350 to 245 C for 16 hours. The product could then be compression molded at about 3250C into slabs from which specimens were die cut for tensile and compression set tests.Tensile tests were run at 2 per minute, 20 C ASTMD638 77 . Compression set conditions were 22 hours at 1500C, except for example 5 which was run at 1000C ASTM D395, Type 2 . In the melt flow test, the melt indexer temperature was 3650C and 5 minute cuts were taken. Flow rates were reported in grams 10 mins using a 10 Kg weight ASTM 1238 73 . Procedure for Examples 8 and 9. The procedure for Examples 6 ana 9 was similar to Examples 1 to 7 except that the curing was at 2200C, and the products were not heated during preparation above 2500C.

The blend was cooled to 240 2500C before adding the curatives, and temperature taken back up to 3000C during the 15 minutes cure period. All samples were heated at 2450C for 16 hours to complete curing. Examples 10 17 in Table II illustrate embodiments wherein a desirable combination of melt flow, tensile strength and some significant degree of recovery from compression at 100 C was achieved. In the peroxide crosslinked systems, a substantial content of a gel polymer such as thermoplastic B Table II , appears to be highly aesirable to obtain good compression set. Oil swell tests were carried out on the product of Example 16 at 1500C for 70 hours. The swell values were 0.68 in ASTM num 2 oii and 9.4 in DOT 4 Brake Fluid. Example 17 was run twice and the products converted to molding powder of 1 8 size by molding into thick slabs and hand cutting. The molding powder, after dry blending, was fed to a 1 plunger type molding machine with cylinder and nozzle temperatures at 3500C. Various objects incluaing discs, bars and pocket combs were molded by injecting the melt into unheated V block molds.Good mola filling was demonstratea. Trite aiscs were converted into seals by cutting appropriate sized holes.
