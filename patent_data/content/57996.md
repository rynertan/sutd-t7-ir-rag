# Fluid piston device.

## Abstract
A fluid pistol device including a cylinder 14 , a piston 22 axially movable within the cylinder and dividing it into first and second chambers 28, 30 . Mounted on the piston within the first chamber 28 is a pressure responsive valve 82 which can close off passages 52 passing through the piston. A spring loaded plunger 72 is urged against the valve 82 which in turn is urged downwardly by a lighter spring 86 towards the seated position. The arrangement is such that a piston can operate in a low force rapid movement mode in which the valve is open and fluid passes from the second chamber to the first chamber readily, a moderate force rapid movement mode in which the valve floats and still allows this passage of fluid and a high force movement mode in which fluid pressure in the first chamber holds the valve firmly seated.
