## Description
SPECIFICATIONTITLE OF THE IENTIGN NUMERICAL CORGL APPARATUSTECHNICAL FIELD This invention relates to a numerical control apparatus including a display device such as a cathode ray tube which is called hereinafter a CRT and operated in question and answer form.BACKGROUND ART Conventional numerical control apparatus including the CRT have the operating board whose structure is shown in Figure 1 and the individual portions of which are shown in detail in Figure 2. In those Figures 1 is a CRT and 2 is a picture selecting key group for selecting pictures on the CRT which group consists of a plurality of keys 21 to 28 . 3 is a data key group for entering data which group is normally called ten keys. 4 is an address key group consisting of alphabetic letters for distinguishing the contents of the data from one another and 5 is a data editing key group for editing the data entered into a picture face of on the CRT 1 which group consists of a plurality of keys 51 to 58 . 6 is a mode selecting key group for selecting the operation modes of the apparatus and controlled subjects which group consists of a plurality of keys 61 to 68 . Each of theose keys is provided with a predetermined switch. When a working program is entered by said operating board, operating steps of the operator will now be described by using a flow chart shown in Figure 3. The operator first closes an electric source for the control apparatus Figure 3 a . Then that operator judges and determines what should be done next in accordance with the content of a job upon the entry of the working program and comes to the next succeeding movement Figure 3 b . In that case the program preparing key 66 of the mode selecting key group 6 is depressed in order to select the operation modes upon the entry of the working program Figure 3 c .Further the program switch 23 of the picture selecting key group 3 is depressed Figure 3 c in order to select the pictures on the CRT l and a picture for preparing the program is displayed on the CRT 1 Figure 3 f . The operator judges what should be done next Figure 3 e and sets a program number Figure 3 h by depressing a P switch preliminary set in the address key group 4 , a 1st switch and a 6 th switch coded and a setting switch in the data key group 3 . Then a preparatory function is set Figure 3 j by depressing a G switch of the address key group 4 and an 0 switch and the setting switch of the data key group 3 . Subsequently what should be done next is determined and it is set that a positioning point as an objective has an X coordinate of 246.3 Figure 3 1 by depressing an X switch of the address key group 4 and a 2nd, a 4 th, the 6 th, and a 3rd switch and the setting switch of the data key group 3 . Similarly it is set that the positioning point as the objective has a Y coordinate of 623.56 Figure 3 n by depressing aZ switch of the address key group 4 and the 6 th, 2nd, 3rd, 5 th, 6 th and setting switches of the data key group 3 . Thereafter the operator judges and determines what sould be done next Figure 3 o and an auxiliary function such as the setting of a spindles, the start or stop of a coolant or the like is set by depressing an M switch of the address key group 4 and the 3rd and setting switches of the date key group 3 Figure 3 p .This setting of the auxiliary functions is entirely effected by properly depressing the M switch of the address key group 4 and the numerical switches of the data key group 3 in accordance with the type of each of the auxiliary functions to be set Figure 3 q . Then, in order to set a preparatory function, the G switch of the address key group 4 and the 1st and setting switches of the data key group 3 are depressed thereby to set the preparatory function Figure 3 s . Thereafter while observing a program sheet preliminarily prepared, the operator repeats the judgement and determination each time. Furthermore preparatory functions are properly set to complete the preparation of the program Figure 3 x . Now since the conventional numerical control apparatus is constructed as described above and the operator repeats always the judgement and determination, the apparatus has not only caused the problems in that the operation frequency is very high, the operating steps become complicated and the workability is poor but also the same has been disadvantageous in that in the apparauts itself, the operating board includes a large numbers of the components, and is so much increased in the number of the wirings and assembling steps while being large in sapce. In addition, improvements in performance of the numerical control apparatus are attended with increases in corresponding switches lamps etc. This results in the abovementioned disadvantages still more increasing in extent of their adverse conditions. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION The present invention is provided with means for successively displaying message sentences which are called hereinafters messages on a picture face of a display device such as a CRT in accordance with the operating steps of the operator while being provided with means for displaying on said picture face operating or selecting items subsidiary to or independent of the messages or proper menu sentences which are called hereinafter menus and selecting a desired one of those items whereby the operating steps are rendered to alleviate the operation load of the operator while at the same time the apparatus itself is devised to be simplified.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Figures 1 to 3 are to describe a conventional apparatus respectively wherein Figure 1 is a front view of an operating board having incorporated therein a CRT as a display device Figure 2 is a front view illustrating in detail the individual portions of the operating board and Figure 3 is a flow chart for describing the operating steps of the conventional apparatus. Figures 4 to 6 are to describe one embodiment of the present invention respectively, wherein Figure 4 is a front view of the operating board Figures 5 a to e are charts illustrating operation items displayed as menus and Figure 6 is a flow chart for describing the operating steps of the embodiment of the apparatus.BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION One embodiment of the present invention will now be described on the basis of Figures 4 to 6. Still more Figure 4 shows the front face of the operating board Figures 5 a to e show one example of the operating items displayed as the menus and Figure 6 shows a flow of the operating steps of the operator. In Figure 4 1 is a CRT a picture of which is composed of letters, for example, in 24 rows and 80 columus and has reserved thereon a message display unit la , an input data display unit lb , a set date display unit lc and a menu display unit Id by which the present invention is characterized.Furthermore disposed on this operating board are a menu selecting key group 11 including a plurality of switches corresponding to the operating items on the said menu display unit led 1 a menu stepping key 12 for manually stepping pages of the menu. And the pages of the menu displayed on the said manu display unit ld can be renewed in accordance with the contents of the menu sucessively displayed on the said munu display unit la or through the manual operation of the menu stepping key 12 . Figures 5 a to e show one exmaple of the operating items on each page of the menus displayed on the said menu display unit ld wherein Figure 5 a shows a menu for the operation modes Figure 5 b a menu for the picture face of the CRT Figure 5 c a menu for G codes Figure 5 d a menu for auxiliary functions and Figure 5 e shows a menu for editing data. By depressing that key switch at its position corresponding to the menu for the desired operating item on this page within the menu selecting key group ill , the operator attains his or her purpose.Accordingly the content of the message displayed on the message display unit la can be successively renewed either by using the date key group 3 to enter the input display unit lb with date or by selecting a menu for the desired operating item among the menus displayed on the menu display unit lb with this The operator is led by that message and may carry forward the operation while renewing the message. Still more pages difficult to be displayed correspondingly to messages as in the menu for editing data are constructed to be manually displayed by depressing the switches of the menu stepping key 12 . The description will now be made by means of a flow chart shown in Figure 6 and with reference to how the message is renewed, that is, how the operator answers a question by a message. For convenience s sake, to prepare a program is taken as an example. When the operator first closes an electric source for the control apparatus Figure 6 a , an OPERATION MODE MENU which is a message for setting an operation mode and the menu for operation modes shown in Figure 5 a are automatically displayed on the message display unit la and the menu display unit ld on the picture face of the CRT 1 respectively.Thus the operator is led by them to select a PROGRAMPREPARING from the menu for the said operation modes Figure 5 a and depresses that switch corresponding thereto of the menu selecting key group 11 Figure 6 c . Then a message CRT PICTURE FACE MENLi .and the menu for the CRT picture face Figure 5 b are automatically displayed on the message display unit la and the menu display unit ld respectively. The operator selects PROGRAM from the menu for the CRT picture face and depresses that switch corresponding thereto of the menu selecting key group 11 Figure 6 e . Further as the picture face of the CRT has a PROGRAM NO DATA which is a message for preparing the program, displayed on the message display unit la , a 1st, a 6 th and a setting switch of the data key group 3 coded and set as a program number are depressed Figure 6 h whereupon that program number is displayed on the input date display unit lb .Thereby the program number is set to display a message G CODES XMENU and the menu for the G codes shown in Figure 5 c on the message display unit la and the menu display unit ld . The operator selects FIRSTLINE GOES from the said menu for G codes and depresses that switch corresponding thereto of the menu selecting key group 11 to set a POSITIONING GOES Figure 6 j . Subsequently a message TERMINUS X dDATE for setting a terminus is displayed on the message display unit la on the picture face of the CRT and displayed on the input data display unit b by depressing a 2nd, a 4 th, the 6 th, a ., a 3rd and the setting switch of the data key group 3 and herewith a terminus X coordinate is set to 246.3 Figure 6 e .Similarly a message TERMINUS Z DATA is displayed on the picture face of the CRT and the 6 th, the 2nd, the 3rd, the ., a 5 th, the 6 th and the setting switch of the data key groups 3 are depressed to set a terminus Z coordinate to 623.56 Figure 6 n . Thereafter a message AUXILIARY FUNCTION MENU for setting an auxiliary function and the menu for auxiliary functions shown in Figure S d are displayed on the message display unit la and the menu display unit ld on the CRT picture face 1 respectively and a SPINDLE cwtt, COOLANT ON and others are properly selected from that menu and the switches corresponding thereto of the menu selecting key group ill are depressed Figure 6 p .Still more, a message G CODES MENU and the menu for G codes Figure 5 c are displayed, and a STRAIGHT LINE G1 is selected from that menu and that switch corresponding thereto of the menu selecting key group 11 is depressed whereby a cutting into a straight line is set Figure 6 r . Hereinafter the setting of data or the selection of the menus is repeated through the leading by messages displayed on the basis of a predetermined program format after which the menu for auxiliary functions Figure 5 d is displayed and the switches corresponding to PROGRAM END , SPINDLE OFF , COOLANTOFF etc. of the menu selecting key groups 11 are depressed whereby the program is completed to be prepared. Furthermore the menu and data susequently set in this way are displayed, as the completed program, on the set data display unit lc on the CRT 1 . While the abovementioned embodiment has been illustrated in terms of the messages and menus displated with every day language symbols, codes or others may be used. Also while the messages have been displayed with a single sentence one after another, a plurality of sentences may be displayed at a time. Furthermore the ON and OFF states of the menu may be distinguished from each other by inverting letters on the picture face one to the other of white ang black, brushing them, or making them small or capital. Also, in addition to the display device for displaying relying on a CRT, the liquid crystal display and other may be substituted for the CRT so long as they can display a multitude of letters. Also while the abovementioned embodiment has been described in conjunction with the preparation of program it is applicable to the operation of normal machines. At that time the items of setting data can be omitted. As described above and according to the present invention, the operator answers questions from messages by either setting data or selecting the menus whereby the operator can successively carry forward the operations and may regularly perform the operations.Also since the menu selecting key has different functions corresponding to the individual menus one for each page thereof, the number of the seitches on the operating board can be extremely decreased. Furthermore the messages and menus are processed by changing software resulting in the effect that the functions can readily be varied or extended.
