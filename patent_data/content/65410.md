## Description
FILLER The present invention relates to an improve thermally insulating filler and to compositions containing such fillet. More particularly, one aspect of the present i Lvention relates to a thermally insulating filler suitable for use, for example, in the production of insulating concretes, plasters, buildinboard and composites. Thermal insulants employed, for example, iz the building industry fall into several different categories. For example they may be massive i.e. unexpanded materials such as organic polymers which have a relatively low thermal conductivity they may be comprised by a layer of gas, e.g. air, enclosed between two or more layers of solid material as used in the familiar cavity wall method of construction they may comprise structural or decorative materials containing a substantial quantity of gas normally air trapped within their structure, for example Thermalite blocks, expanded Portland or magnesia cements, or expanded organic resins or they may comprise composites of a structural material, for example, concrete, plaster, magnesia cement, alumina cement, or an organic resin together with a particulate thermally insulating filler, for example, exfoliated vermiculite, expanded perlite, expanded clays and slate, pumice, expanded pulverised fuel ash PFA , expanded organic resins or hollow particles of e.g. glass. It is well known that the thermal insulating properties of building composites, e.g. concrete, containing thermally insulating filler particles are dependent on a variety of factors including the voluse volume concentration of filler in the structural material and the ratio of solid matter entrained gas if any in the filler.However, it is not usually appreciated that the shape of the insulating filler particles can be of considerable importance in determining the insulating properties of the composite. The present invention provides a thermally insulating filler wherein at least 25Z by volume as hereinafter defined of the total filler comprises thermally insulating particles having a a maximum linear dimension X which is not greater than 100 millimetres, b aBS mesh size not less than 38 microns and c overall dimensions such that the ratio A ID lies in the range 5 1 to 1000to wherein A is the area measured in square miflimetree of the notional plane of greatest cross section through the particle and D is the greatest linear dimension millimetres of the particle in the direction perpendicular to said notional pl ane. Throughout this specification, the term volume as applied to an individual particle e.g. a filler particle is defined as the effective space enclosed by the surface of the particle including the volume of any pores within the particle. The term volume as applied to particles in bulk is the sum of the volumes of the individual particles excluding the volume of any space between the particles.The volumes of filler particles which do not absorb liquid may be conveniently determined by conventional liquid displacement techniques, e.g. water, oil or mercury displacement. In the case of filler particles which absorb liquids, the volumes can be determined for example by powder displacement or by microscopic techniques. A convenient powder displacement technique involves selecting an inert powder e.g. silica or chalk having a fine particle size in relation to the filler material and measuring the volume of the inert powder e.g. in a measuring cylinder under standard compaction conditions.The sample of filler is then added, thoroughly shaken with the inert powder and the new volume measured under the standard compaction conditions. The volume of the filler is taken as the difference between the two measured readings. A further technique which can be employed to measure the volume of filler materials is to prepare a standard fine cement forsulation and to set weighed samples of the cement with and without filler under standard conditions. The volume of the filler can readily be deduced from the change in density between set cement samples. Preferably at least 50Z and most preferably at least 90 by volume of the total filler comprises thermally insulating particles having the defined dimensional characteristics a , b and c hereinbefore recited, the balance if any being met, for example, by conventional fillers which may be thermally insulating if desired , reinforcement or other additives. The thermally insulating particles are preferably of uniform size and shape. The thermally insulating filler particles of the present invention suitably comprise particles of solid material or expanded solid material, or hollow particles of solid material. The average thermal conductivity of the defined filler particles is preferably not greater than 0.5, most preferably not greater than O.i watt metre l 0C 1 measured with respect to the individual particles. In the case where the filler particles consist of massive material ie material containing no voids the thermal conductivity may be measured directly on the massive material, or in the c ase of some materials may be available by reference to the literature.In the case where the filler particles are inhomogeneous, eg comprise mixtures of different materials or contain entrained air or voids the thermal conductivity may be measured directly on each individual particle in a representative ssmple of the particles or on a sheet or block of material having the same physical and chemical structure, for example a block of material from which the particles are formed.Alternatively, it is possible to calculate the average thermal conductivity of some inhomogeneous particles, for example hollow plastic discs, from knowledge of the geometry of the discs and the thermal conductivity of the plastics material and the contained gas.In the case that the average thermal conductivity of a particle varies with the direction in which it is measured, the term average thermal conductivity as used in this specification means the value obtained as measured perpendicular to the notional plane of greatest cross section. The thermally insulating filler particles of the present invention are suitably made of, for example, expanded plastics, for example polystyrene, polyurethane, phenolic resin or polyethylene in massive or expanded form expanded minerals or rocks, for example exfoliated vermiculite or expanded perlite expanded cements such as expanded Portland cement or expanded magnesia cement expanded glass, sintered glass or coated glass fibre or biological materials such as wood, cork or coated vegetable fibre. Preferably the filler material of the present invention is in expanded form or in the form of hollow particles and most preferably such expanded forms are rigid or semi rigid. It is desirable that the filler material is expanded to the fullest extent reasonably practicable whilst retaining an adequate mechanical strength for its proposed application.Filler particles comprising polymer foams are preferred. Closed cell polymer foams are particularly preferred. The present invention requires that at least 25Z by volume of the filler particles have a ratio A D which lies in the range 5 1 to 1000 1. It is preferred that the ratio lies in the range 10 1 to 1000 1. The maximum linear dimension X is preferably not greater than 25 millimetres. Most preferably X lies in the range 1 10 millimetres. Examples of shapes of particles which can fall within the recited mathematical definition are planar or dished discs, buttons, platelets or lamella oblate spheroids or any generally planar geometrical shapes, e.g. flat squares or triangles. The dimensions X and D and the area A can conveniently be determined by standard optical microscopy and or electron microscopy.Figures 1 and 2 of the accompanying drawings diagrammatically illustrate on an enlarged scale an example of a filler particle according to the present invention showing the dimensions X and D and the area A . Figure 1 is a cross sectional view and Figure 2 is a plan view of the particle. In this case the notional plane of greatest cross section 2 bisects the particle into two equal segments 3, 4. For most particles it will be observed that X will tend to lie in the same plane, or nearly the same plane, as A . For example, for a particle having the shape of a flat rectangular sheet, D will be approximately the thickness of the sheet, A will be approximately the area of the sheet and X will be approximately the diagonal of the rectangle. Examples of filler particles according to the present invention comprise discs of expanded plastics material, hollow particles, for example hollow oblate spheroids of thersoplastics, lamellae of exfoliated vermiculite or buttons of coated glass fibre. The filler particles of the present invention may be manufactured by a variety of techniques. For example, discs of expanded plastics material may conveniently be stamped from a sheet by mechanical means. Hollow oblate spheroids of thermoplastics may be made for example by heat sealing blisters between two sheets of thermoplastics film and stamping out the blisters. Lamellae of exfoliated vermiculite may be manufactured by a cleaving process. Buttons or discs of coated glass fibre may be made, for example, by stamping a web of glass fibre wadding to form discs or buttons and then treating the surfaces thereof with a layer of sealant, for example, by dipping or spraying. Suitable sealants are, for example, sodium silicate or settable synthetic resins.It is also advantageous to seal the surface of absorbent filler particles, for example, lamellae of exfoliated vermiculite, against the absorption of water or other materials which reduce the thermal insulation properties of the material. The sealing may be achieved, for example, by treating the material with settable resin, sodium silicate or silicone compounds.This type of process is described for example in UK PatentSpecification No 790636. The present invention further provides a curable composition comprising a mixture of I a thermally insulating filler comprising thermally insulating particles having a a maximum linear dimension X which is not greater than 100 millinetres, b a BS mesh size not less than 38 microns and c overall dimensions such that the ratio A D lies in the range 5 1 to 1000 1 wherein A is the area measured in square millimetres of the notional plane of greatest cross section through the particle and D is the greatest linear dimension millimetres of the particle in the direction perpendicular to said notional plane, II a curable cement or resin and optionally III additional filler, aggregate, reinforcement or other additives used in making cured cement or resin compositions. The curable composition of the present invention suitably comprises 10 to 99Z by volume, preferably 40 90X by volume of the defined thermally insulating particles, the volume X being based on the volume as hereinbefore defined of the total composition. The curable cement or resin employed in the curable composition can be, for example, conventional Portland, lime, alumina or magnesia cement, or synthetic or natural curable resins, for example polyester resin, epoxy resin, polyurethane resin, phenolic resin or curable liquid rubber. The quantity of curable cement or resin present in the curable composition of the present invention is suitably 90 1Z by volume, preferably 60 5Z by volume, based on the volume as herein defined of the total composition. Additional fillers e.g. thermally insulating or otherwise , aggregates or reinforcement which can optionally be present in the composition are suitably selected from the large variety of such materials conventionally employed in the building and plastics fabrication industries. Examples of such fillers, aggregates or reinforcement are sand, chalk, pebbles, rock chippings, glass chippings, mica, talc, glass fibre, carbon fibre, metal fibre, vegetable fibre and metal or plastics shaped reinforcement. The curable composition may also contain other conventional additives, for example, pigments, accelerators, fire retardants, inhibitors, fungicides, water proofing agents or process aids. Use of the thermally insulating filler having particles of the defined shape as required in the present invention in the manufacture of composite materials, for example concrete or filled plastics material, leads to the production of a composite material having improved thermal insulating properties by comparison with conventional fillers having randomly shaped particles. Use of the thermally insulating filler of the present invention in the production of conventional concrete mixes can advantageously be employed to improve the thermal insulation of, for example, screeds or panels of a given thickness, or alternatively the thickness and hence the weight of a screed or panel may be reduced to a significant extent whilst still retaing good thermal insulation properties. This invention is further illustrated with reference to the following Example which employs filler material in accordance with the present invention and Test which is by way of comparison.Example Platelets of exfoliated vermiculite were prepared by cleaving granular vermiculite. The platelets were typically 0.5mm thick, had a mean ratio A D of 14 1 and were greater than BS mesh 38 microns.They were incorporated in fairly random orientation at a variety of different volume concentrations in cement mixes of 1 part Portland cement to 1 2 parts water the proportion of water increasing with the quantity of vermiculite used. Test The same Portland cement water mixes were used as in the Example, but normal, medium grade 2 4 mm granules of exfoliated vermiculate having ratios A ID of approximately 1 1 to 2 1, BS mesh greater than 38 microns replaced the cleaved vermiculite used in the Example. Suitable specimens, of both types and having densities in the range 500 1000kg rn3, were prepared for thermal conductivity measurements. The results corrected to 1X moisture content are summarised in Figure 3 together with those published for normal vermiculite concrete thermal conductivity of Masonry Materials,Pamela Arnold BRS Curren Papers January 1970. Specimens of the type described in the Test were used for control purposes and to compare with published data, as can be seen from Figure 3. The specimens with plate like vermiculite according to the present invention, over the density range investigated, see curve 1 show a significant reduction in thermal conductivity of 25 to 30 compared to those for normal vermiculite see curve 2 . A further aspect of the present invention provides a cured cellular body comprising a cured body of resin or cement having a plurality of voids therein, at least 25Z, preferably 40 100X by space volume as hereinafter defined of the voids having a a maximum linear dimension not greater than 100 millimetres, preferably not greater than 25 millimetres, b overall dimensions such that the ratio B E lies in the range 5 1 to 1000 1, preferably 10 1 to 1000 1, wherein Bl is the area measured in square millimetres of the notional plane of greatest cross section of the void and E is the greatest linear dimension millimetres of the void in a direction perpendicular to said notional plane and c E not greater than 4mm, preferably not greater than 2mm, and not less than 38 microns, preferably not less than 100 microns. By space volume is meant the sum of volumes of the individual voids within the cured body. Suitably the space volume of the voids present in the cured cellular body occupies 10 99Z, preferably 40 90X by volume of the total volume of the cellular body. The cured cellular body of the present invention can be fabricated, for example, by curing a composition comprising a mixture of curable cement or resin and expanded particles of a thermoplastic resin having a particle size and shape approximately equal to the size and shape of the desired voids. The voids are then formed by subjecting the cured cement or resin to heat or solvent treatment to cause breakdown e.g. by melting or dissolution of the expanded particles. Alternatively, the cured cellular body of the present invention may be formed by curing a composition comprising a mixture of curable cement or resin and inflated blisters of, for example, thermoplastics or glass having a particle size and shape approximately equal to the size and shape of the desired voids.
