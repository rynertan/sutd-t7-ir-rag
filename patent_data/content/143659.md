# Hose pipe.

## Abstract
A reinforced helically convoluted flexible hose pipe com prises a helically convoluted tube 12 having in the roots of the convolutions an externally wound wire reinforcement 18 , the latter having a flat section and being wound such that the roots of the internal convolutions 14 are flattened. Further more the axial width of the internal convolutions is several times greater than that of the external convolutions 16 . By this means eddy currents are reduced in fluids passing through the hose while desirable properties such as crush resistance, kink resistance and vacuum resistance are not sacrificed.

## Description
HOSE PIPEThis invention relates to hose pipes, in particular to wire reinforced flexible convoluted hose pipes.Wire reinforced, convoluted, flexible, plastics materials hose pipes such as those described in our UK Patent No.1543586 are increasingly being employed where it is necessary to transfer fluid through a flexible line, for example when loading loading or unloading fluid from tankers. Such hoses combine lightness in weight with flexibility and high resistance to kinking, crushing, and vacuum.A longitudinal section through the hose wall shows that the hose tube has a sinusoidally curved profile. When fluid is flowing through the tube the shape of the wall causes eddy currents to form and, in turbulent flow conditions, these can be severeand create a disturbance of the flow through the hose. In certain cases, with low viscosity fluids such as gasses, resonance can occur at specific flow rates and some of the energy loss exhibits itself in sound waves which can, when in the audible range of frequencies, be objectionable in a working environment.The problem can be partially overcome by reducing the height and pitch of the convolutions in the hose. This solution renders the tube less capable of withstanding severe bending without risk of kinking and also such constructions are less capable of withstanding vacuum without collapse owing to the shallowness of the convolution form. The invention seeks to provide a form of hose construction improved in the above respects.According to the present invention there is provided a reinforced helically convoluted flexible hose pipe which comprises a helically convoluted tube having, in the roots of the convolutions, an externally wound wire reinforcement, the wire having a flat section and being wound such that the roots of the convolutions are flattened.While the term wire is employed herein it will be appreciated that this is primarily because the articles with which the invention is concerned are referred to as wire reinforced . In this context the term wire includes profiled strips and in connection with the present invention a flat profiled strip is in fact employed as the wire . The use of a flat profiled wire reinfrocement causes the roots of the convolutions to be flattened and present, on their internal faces, substantially plain cylindrical surface. By ensuring that the radially outer convolutions are restricted to as small an axial width as possible, turbulent flow can be reduced to a minimum.The invention will be described further, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawing, the sole figure of which is a partial sectional view through a hose pipe constructed in accordance with the invention.Referring to the drawing, it can be seen that a wire reinforced helically convoluted hose pipe generally designated 10 comprises a helically convoluted tube 12 having external and internal convolutions 14 and 16 respectively. Wound into the roots of the external convolutions is a wire reinforcement 18. The wire 18 is in the form of a flat profiled strip wound so that 16 the roots of the external convolutions which correspond to the peaks of the internal convolutions 14 are caused to be flat and internally of the hose 10 present a right cylindrical surface.The pitch of the winding of the convolutions 14, 16 is chosen in conjunction with the axial width of the wire 18 so that the convolutions 16 are axially compressed so that the internal gap 20 is of the smallest axial extent practicable the gap 20 is of axial length X in the figure and is considerably less than the axial length Y of the cylindrical inner surface of the convolutions 14.The convolution depth Z is relatively high and thus the hose pipe constructed in accordance with the invention retains it desirable properties of kink resistence, crush resistence, and vacuum resistence.However, it has been found that the generation of eddy currents is considerably reduced with this form of construction and resonance when employed with low viscosity fluids such as gasses is reduced or eliminated. Thus, the construction of the invention provides a simple and effective solution to the reduction of eddy currents in helically convoluted flexible hoses without sacrifice of the desirable properties of crush resistance, kink resistance or vacuum resistance. The invention is applicable to all forms of hoses of this type but is especially useful in connection with plastics material hoses and in particular with polytetrafluoroethylene hoses. As is usual in this field the hose of the invention can be provided with end fittings as desired and may be protected with a woven braid or other form of covering.Furthermore, the wire is preferably made of metal, but may be made of another material of appropriate physical properties 2 a plastics material.
