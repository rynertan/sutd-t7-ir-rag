# A METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR ASCERTAINING DENSITY FEATURES OF UNDERGROUND EARTH REGIONS, AND A DETECTOR MODULE USABLE THEREIN FOR DETECTING THE FLUX AND TRAJECTORIES OF MUONS

## Abstract
A plurality of detectors 12 is disposed within a bore hole for ascertaining the frequency and trajectory of high energy muons that penetrate through the earth. This information is converted by data processor 42 into an integrated density value of the earth for incremental angular lines of sight extending through spaced apart elevations along the detectors 12 . The data processor 42 uses a tomographic analysis process to combine together all of those integrated density values for all of the elevations of interest to calculate the densities of discrete spatial volumes composing the underground region being investigated. Detectors 12 produce electrical signals indicative of the trajectory of the passing muon. The signals are recorded by time to digital converter TDC units 30 . If the signals appear to have possibly originated from a high energy muon, a micro processor 38 retrieves the information collected by TDC units 30 and transmits it to a data logger 40 located at the earth s surface. The data processor 42 then utilizes tomographic analysis to make the localized density determinations discussed above.
