## Description
PROCESS FOR PREPARING A FLUFF PULP.This invention refers to a process in preparing a high absorption fluff pulp from a pulp suspension on a pulpdrying machine,w herein,to improve fiberizing,to the pulp suspension before or on the wire is added a debonding agent and optionally, to improve the absorption, an absorption promoting agent.It is known to use fluff produced by dry fiberizing of fluff pulp, such as cellulose pulp in the form of web rolls or pulp bales, for absorbent media in sanitary products such as diapers and sanitary napkins.Fluff pulp is conventionally prepared on a pulp drying machine having a wet end comprising a wire and a press section and a drying section. In order to reduce the tearing power and to facilitate the fiberizing, the pulp before or on the wire can be provided with certain additives which reduce the bonding and the friction between the fibres in the pulp.In adding debonding agents it should, however, be observed that they can have an injurious effect on the remaining characteristics of the fluff which are desirable in technical use, for instance fluid absorption time, high brightness, high bulk and good elasticity characteristics.From US Patent 3,395,708 it is known to add cationic tensides to cellulose pulp in order to facilitate the fiberizing. The cationic tensides generally are substantive and consequently adhere well to the fibres. The addition of cationic tensides, for instance quaternary ammonium compounds, however, has a hydrophobic influence on the fibres and is accordingly detrimental to the fluid absorption ability of the fluff pulp and often to its brightness too. In order to avoid these disadvantages cationic tensides have been combined with absorption promoting agents, for instance nonionic tensides. Cationic tensides remain cationic both in alkaline and acid environment. The tendency to make the fibres hydrophobic could then only be compensated for by, as stated above, mixing with an absorption promoting agent, such as a nonionic tenside.Said disadvantages can, however, be overcome completely or to a large extent in accordance with the invention by the use of such additives to the pulp which change characteristics when the environment from being acid becomes neutral or alkaline. According to the present invention a process in preparing a high absorption fluff pulp is characterized in that the debonding agent is an ampholytic tenside and or a tenside, which depending on the pH value is cationic or nonionic, said tenside s is added in an amount of 0.01 2 by weight based on the dry weight of the pulp suspension, the pH value of the pulp suspension at the addition is kept sufficiently low for the tenside s to be in cationic form, one or more absorption promoting agents is added, if required, and the pH value of the pulp after dewatering on the wire is increased to such an extent that the debonding tenside s is transferred into the anionic and nonionic form respectively.Suitable absorption promoting agents are anionic tensides and nonionic tensides. As examples can be mentioned straight or branched aliphatic alcohols having at least 8 carbon atoms in the alkyl chain, carboxylic amides with at least 12 carbon atoms in the alkyl chain and ethanol amides of straight or branched aliphatic hydrocarbons with at least 12 carbon atoms in the hydrocarbon chain.The debonding tensides are added to the pulp before or on the wire in an acid environment, that is at pH values below 7.By increasing the pH value of the pulp the additives are transferred from cationic form into the anionic and nonionic form respectively depending on the nature of the additives . By this the fluid absorption capacity of the final product is increased. This increase of the pH value must be performed not to loose the intended effect of the additives on the fiberizing of the pulp and should therefore take place after a substantial reduction of the water content of the pulp.According to the invention the increase of the pH value can take place as follows An alkaline liquid is supplied to the web a. just before the pulp web leaves the wire b. immediately before one or more of the presses c. between the last press and the drying section d. in the drying section, the addition being made so quickly that the web will be moistened through before the liquid evaporates to any considerable extent e. in connection with the feeding of the pulp to the fluffing machine shredder .By this change of the characteristics of the tenside, after having served the purpose to prevent the forming of fibre bonds, its tendency to make the fibres hydrophobic is compensated for. The liquid absorption capacity of the fibres is increased by this. If required this effect could be further strengthened by the addition of a tenside mixture to the pulp before or on the wire, which mixture comprises an ampholytic and or cationic nonionic tenside to facilitate the fiberizing and a non cationic tenside to increase the liquid absorption capacity, for instance a nonionic or an anionic tenside.A. Examples of ampholytic tensides which are cationic in acid and anionic in alkaline media are a aminocarboxylic acids or aminosulphonic acids of the general formula EMI4.1 wherein R1 is a straight or branched chain, saturated or unsaturated alkyl group with 8 24 carbon atoms,R2 is hydrogen, a short alkyl group with 1 6 carbon atoms or a chain containing 1 40 oxyethylene groups, and R3 is a residue containing a group COOH or SO3H. As an example can be mentioned.EMI4.2 In addition should be mentioned betaines.These compounds are internal ammonium salts and can contain one or more amino groups. As an example could be mentioned betaines of the general formulaEMI4.3 wherein R1 is a straight or branched, saturated or unsaturated alkyl group with 8 24 carbon atoms,R2 and R5 are alkylene groups with 1 2 carbon atoms, 4 is a groupP nH2n 1 or CnH 2nOH wherein n is an integer between 1 and 10, or C2H4O xH wherein x is an integer between 2 and 100, R3 is R4 or a group R1 NH C R2, R5 COOH or R2 COOMe, wherein R1, R2, R4 and R5 are as defined above, Me is a monovalent, salt forming radical and X is O or S.

These products are prepared from imidazoline com pounds of the general fomula EMI5.1 which are carboxymethylated under the addition of one or more groups CH2COO or sulphonated or sulphated. R is a straight or branched, saturated or unsaturated alkyl group with 8 24 carbon atoms. As an example could be mentioned a commercial product,Miranol C2M, which in anhydrous acid form has the following formula.EMI5.2 B. Examples of tensides which are cationic in acid and nonionic in alkaline or neutral media are alkylene oxide derivates of a monoamines comprising 1. N primary alkyl amines with 10 22 carbon atoms in a straight or branched, saturated or unsaturat ed alkyl group, for instance tallow fatty amine or stearyl amine. 2. tertiary alkyl primary amines, for instance 12 14NH2 or t C1 8 22NH2 3. resin amine for instance dehydroabiethylamine. b polyamines comprising 1. N alkyl alkylene diamines with 12 24 carbon atoms in a the alkyle group which can be straight or branched, saturated or unsaturated and with 1 12 carbon atoms in the alkylene group, for instance tallow fatty amine propylene diamine and 2. alkyl polyalkylene polyamines of the general formula R NH CnH2n x CnH2n NH2 fr rein R is an alkyl group which can be straight or branched, saturated or unsaturated and contain 12 24 carbon atoms, n is an integer between 1 and 12 and x is an integer between 1 and 8.Alkylene oxide derivatives of said amines are obtained by addition of ethylene oxide or ethylene oxide and a higher alkylene oxide containing 3 6 carbon atoms, wherein the higher alkylene oxide can be added before, together with or after the ethylene oxide. EXAMPLE 1Test with an ampholytic debonding agent consisting of a complex tallow ammonium carboxylate.The debonding agent was added to a 2.5 slurry of sulphate pulp fibres at pH 4.5. After stirring of the suspension for 10 minutes it was diluted to a fibre concentration of 0.5 and formed into sheets dry basis weight 750 g m2 in a laboratory sheet mould.One part of these test sheets sample B was pressed without a pH change to a dry content of 40 . The remaining sheets sample C were pressed to a dry content of 30 , whereupon the pH of the sheets was increased to 10.5 by spraying with, based on 1 g dry pulp, 10 g alkaline water, the sheets being arranged on a suction filter drawing off the surplus water. Thereafter these sheets were pressed to a dry content of 40 .As a comparison. sheets sample A were prepared of sulphate pulp not containing a debonding agent.All test sheets were dried to a dry content of 93 after the pressing and were conditioned at 230C and a relative humidity of 50 . They were then shredded to fluff on a spiked roller.The energy that was utilized for the shredding, the tearing power, was read. Fluff cushions with a diameter of 50 mm and a weight of 2 g were formed. They were pressed to a hight of 15 mm which was kept constant. The time required for water to be absorbed from the bottom of the cushion to its top, the absorption time, was measured. The results are given in Table 1.
