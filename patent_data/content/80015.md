# A boot with bootlace fastening means.

## Abstract
A bootlace fastening means is described, comprising two upright and serrated side edges provided on either side of a cut open portion of a boot to form teeth 3, 3 , 5, 5 and notches 4, 4 , 6, 6 all along its length, each tooth having an eyelet and projecting upward in the same direction of lace 7 running diagonally from one eyelet to the next upper one on the other side to effect a better delivery of power of pull on eyelets for even tightening and each of the teeth and notches gradually becoming greater in width and height step by step upwards equally on either side to effect a larger spacing between adjacent eyelets at each step upwards, consequently resulting in a smaller number of eyelets in all and in less friction of the lace between the eyelets, and a tongue provided on the inner side of the fastening edges, and comprising a lacing both ends of which are run initially outwards through the bottom eyelets 8, 8 from the inner side to run to the next upper eyelets on the opposite sides and to go on in the same manner through these to other next upper eyelets on respective sides to effect an instant, simultaneous and uniform fastening throughout all eyelets to ensure that the feet are comfort able under any conditions and that the time used in a fasten ing operation in an emergency such as a military operation is reduced.
