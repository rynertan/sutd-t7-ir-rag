# Method of transmitting and receiving compatible color television signals on two channels for broadcasting from satellite and apparatus for carrying out said method.

## Abstract
In order to improve the quality of color television signals for broadcasting via satellite the signals are transmitted on two of the channels available for transmissions via satellite according to the rules established by CCIR. In the case of a transmission by means of a compatible system the NTSC, PAL or SECAM signal is transmitted on the first of the two channels and on the second channel there are transmitted the baseband R Y and B Y signals from 0 to about 3 MHz sequentially on alternate lines and up to the limit of the video band the high frequency components of the luminance signal. In the case of a transmission by means of a non compatible system there is transmitted on the first channel the lumi nance information in the whole available band and on the second channel the chrominance information R Y and B Y in the whole available band according to the following two alternatives 1 the information is transmitted by means of a time division multiplex, i.e. in the first half of the active line there is transmitted one of the chrominance components and in the second half the other component 2 the information is transmitted by means of a fre quency sharing multiplex, i.e. one of the components is transmitted in baseband, i.e. from 0 to about 3 MHz and the other component is transmitted on an amplitude modulated subcarrier with single side band or vestigial band.
