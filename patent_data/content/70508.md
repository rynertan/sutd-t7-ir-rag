# Coaxial bidirectional spool valve.

## Abstract
Coaxial bidirectional spool valves are provided for use in fluid systems such as hydrostat systems where flow can proceed in opposite directions, and which direct flow through a unidirectional or multidirectional function such as a filter assembly in the normal direc tion regardless of the direction of flow in the system. The valve includes a spool valve 1 reciprocably mov able between two limiting positions according to fluid pressure differential across the valve and engaging one of a pair of bungee followers 2, 3 in each position, thereby intercepting and controlling flow through a box junction of the fluid line with the lines leading to and from the filter assembly 28 in a manner such that, regardless of the direction of flow in the fluid line, flow proceeds it the same direction in the connecting fluid lines to and from the function.
