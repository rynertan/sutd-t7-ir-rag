# Apparatus for making window patches.

## Abstract
A web 14 of patch material is unwound from a reel and conveyed to apparatus 44 for applying adhesive to preselected portions of one surface of the web. Positioned downstream of the adhesive applicator 44 is patch severing apparatus 22 associ ated with a vacuum roll 18 . Positioned between the patch severing apparatus 22 and the adhesive applicator 44 is a vacuum conveyor 52 . The vacuum conveyor 52 includes a porous conveying surface 68 having a web receiving end portion 64 and a web discharging end portion 66 . A vacuum housing 72 having a passageway 74 connected to a source of reduced pressure is positioned below the porous conveying surface 68 . A ported stationary plate 76 is secured to the housing 72 above the vacuum passageway 74 . A ported movable plate 80 is adjustably positioned in overlying relation with the stationary plate 76 . Each plate has a plurality of suction ports 78 therethrough. The conveyor 54 pulls the web 14 from the adhesive applicator 44 and pushes the web 14 to the patch severing apparatus 22 where window patches P are cut from the web. The window patches P are transferred onto the surface 20 of the vacuum roll 18 and therefrom onto the cut windows of envelope blanks.
