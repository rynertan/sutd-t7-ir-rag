# Process for separating normal paraffins from branched and cyclic hydrocarbons.

## Abstract
Normal paraffins are separated from mixtures of the same with cyclic hydrocarbons having more than six carbon atoms per molecule and or branched chain hydrocarbons by contacting the mixture at adsorption conditions with an adsorbent comprising silicalite, whereby the normal paraffin is selectively adsorbed. It may then be recovered from the adsorbent by desorption with a desorbent material. Prefer ably a simulated moving bed countercurrent flow adsorption system is used.
