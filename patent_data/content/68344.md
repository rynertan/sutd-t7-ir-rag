## Description
METHOD AND REAGENT KIT FOR MEASUREMENT USING no ENZYME LABELLED ANTIBODY The present invention relates to a method and reagent kit for measuring the amount of an antigen or antibody in a serum by the solid phase method using an enzyme labelled antibody. zaire particularly, it relates toa method and reagent kit for measuring the amount of an antigen or antibody in a serum by the solid phase method using an enzyme labelled antibody, which comprises, as one of the constitutional requirements, the removal of a non specific inhibitor present in the serum. On measuring the amount of an antigen or antibody in a serum, a technique to measure it by the solid phase method using an enzyme labelled antibody has become widely employed as a safe and simple method. However, it is observed that the values of an antigen or antibody obtained by measurement by said method extremely vary depending on the time expired between blood taking and measuring, and thus that a constant value is not obtained. One of the reason of this, for example, as reported in Clinica Chemica Acta, Vol. 87, 367 372 1978 , is due to the influences of a certain inhibitor present in a serum sample. In other words, the inhibitor forms its own film along the solid phase surface and becomes a barrier between the antigen and the antibody, thereby blocking the reaction between them. Therefore, it can be seen that this blockade is a nonspecific phenomenon which has nothing to do with the kind and amount of the antigen and antibody. Further, since the amount of the inhibitor in a serum is not always constant and varies depending on the time expired between blood taking and measuring, the conditions for pretreatment of a serum sample prior to measurement etc., the degree of inhibition varies widely and in some cases 100 inhibition could occur. Under such circumstances, in order to accurately measure the amount of the antigen or antibody in the serum by the solid phase method using an enzyme labelled antibody, it is necessary to eliminate the influences of the inhibitor in the serum. From such anaspect, we have been intensively searching for a means to remove the inhibitor or eliminate the inhibiting influences thereof and, as a result, have discovered that the aimed purpose can be achieved by previously adding one reagent or a combination of two reagents selected from the group consisting of EDTA, kaolin, an antigen antibody complex, an ammonium salt, zymosan and anti Clq to the serum or the antigen antibody reaction system involved in the mea surement, thus having accomplished the present invention. Accordingly, the purpose of the present invention is to permit accurate measurement of the amount of.an antigen or antibody in a serum by eliminating influences due to an inhibitor present in a serum sample by previously adding one reagent or a combination of two reagents selected from the group consisting of EDTA, kaolin, an antigen antibody complex, an ammonium salt, zymosan and anti Clq to the serum or the antigen antibody reaction system involved in the measurement. Fig. 1 shows the percent recovery Or each measured value of retoprotein for various specimens. The feature of the present invention is that the percent recovery of measurement is at such a high level as 90 100 , and therefore the amount of an antigen or antibody in a serum can be accurately measured. The additive to be used in the present invention is one reagent or a combination of two selected reagents from the group consisting of EPTA, kaolin, an antigen antibody complex, an ammonium salt, zymosan and anti Clq. Among those, EDTA ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and salts thereof is most preferred in view of the inhibition eliminating effect, simplicity of use and safety of the substance itself. On measuring, EDTA may be directly added to the serum or may be added to the antigen antibody reaction system involved in the measurement.That is, it is possible to directly add EDTA to the serum to inactivate the inhibitor in the serum, or alternatively, it is possible to previously add a dilution containing EDTA to a measuring cup in which the antigen or antibody has been coated on its solid phase and then add d sample serum thereto to cause the antigen antibody reaction involved in the measurement. Kaolin may be used only in the case where it is directly added to the serum, allowed to stand at room temperature, centrifuged to obtain a supernatant and the supernatant is measured.For example, kaolin may be added to a fresh serum to a concentration of 10.mg ml, allowed to stand at room temperature for an hour, centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 20 minutes, and the supernatant is thus recovered. The antigen antibody complex also can be used only in the case where it is added to a serum, allowed to stand at room temperature, centrifuged to obtain a supernatant and the supernatant is measured. As the antigenantibody complex, an immune complex obtained in the NHS normal human serum anti NHS reaction may be used.In this case, said complex is added to a fresh serum to a concentration of e.g. 2 mg ml or so, allowed to stand at room temperature for 30 minutes, and centrifuged to obtain a supernatant for measurement Zymosan and anti Clq may be used in the case where they are either directly added to a serum, or added to the antigen antibody reaction system involved in the measurement, without subjecting to centrifugation. Similarly, the ammonium salt may be used where it is directly added to a serum, which is then added to the reaction system without subjecting to centrifugation. As the ammonium salt, ammonium sulfate, for example, may be selected, while the amount of the additive to be added varies depending on the kind of the addictive, In the case ofEDTA, for example, the final concentration of 10 mM or higher may be satisfactory for exact measurement.In the case of ammonium sulfate, the final concentration of 200mM or higher may be satisfactory. The present invention may be applied to any embodiment which involves the solid phase method using an enzyme labelled antibody, and, for example, it is effective in methods included in the concept of the solid phase method using an enzyme labelled antibody, such as a sandwich method, a competition method, a two antibody method etc. Further, as described hereinabove, since the inhibition phenomenon involved in the present invention is non specific, the present invention is not restricted by the kinds of the antigen and antibody. For example, as shown in Test Example described hereinbelow, it is effective in any case where the antigen is i feto protein, m aldolase or HBs antigen. Furthermore, the inhibition phenomenon involved in the present invention is remarkable when measuring a fresh serum immediately after blood taking. This is presumed due to the inactivation of the inhibitor in the serum with time, But, since the present invention is effective as long as the inhibitor is present in the serum, the present invention is not restricted by the time expired between blood taking and measuring. The effect of the present invention is demonstrated by the follwoing Test Examples.Test Example 1Samples Concentration of antigen obtained by adding EDTA to two fresh serum sepcimens taken from healthy humans F and K to the final concentrations for measurement in 6 steps described in Table 1.Method 0.05 M Tris hydrochloric acid buffer pH 8.0 containing 30 pg ml of anti m aldolase antibody was added to a measuring cup, allowed to stand at 4 C overnight, then removed from the cup, which was then washed with water, a sample was added thereto and the reaction was incubated at 3.70C for 60 minutes followed by washing. Thereafter, 100 ul of a solution obtained by diluting an alkali phosphatase labelled anti m aldolase antibody with a normal rabbit serum to an optimum concentration was pipetted, and the reaction was incubated at 370C for 60 minutes followed by washing.Thereafter, 100 ul of a solution of 4 mg ml of p nitrophenyl phosphate in 0.05M cabonate buffer was pipetted,the reaction was incubated at 370C for 60 minutes, and then 100 1 of 1N NaOH was pipetted.
