# A device for displaying artwork.

## Abstract
One section 1 of a rectangular frame is releasably secured to the remainder of the frame, in which a backing board 7 is located. When the device is fixed to a site location, the said one section 1 remains removable without damaging the site location, so as to allow a sheet 8 of artwork to be inserted into the frame in a direction parallel to the backing board 7 . The artwork sheet 8 projects at least partly beyond the edge of the backing board 7 adjacent the removable section 1 so as to be grippable to facilitate removal of the artwork sheet 8 .
