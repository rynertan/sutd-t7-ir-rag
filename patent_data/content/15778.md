## Description
DESCRIPTION PARACHUTE WITH INFLATION ASSISTANCE DEVICE The object of this invention is the provision of a parachute having a non mechanical, non pyrotechnic device to ensure the full, rapid and uniform inflation of a parachute canopy deployed at altitudes above ground level which are in the 60 to 90 metre range. Accordingly the invention provides a parachute having a circular canopy of gore construction wherein adjacent canopy gores are joined by radial seams extending from the skirt of the canopy to the apex, characterized by further comprising external additional gores of porous material covering selected canopy gores with that end of each said external additional gore which is nearer to the skirt terminating at a location spaced from the skirt of said circular canopy and means joining the radial edges of each said external additional gore to said circular canopy along the adjacent radial seams at the sides of the respective canopy gore which it covers, the width of said external additional gore being greater than that of said respective canopy gore to define therebetween a compartment extending generally radially of the canopy with the end of said compartment nearer the apex of the canopy closed and the other end of said compartment open. The parachute inflation assistance device, when applied to flat, circular canopies, or conical or hemispherical canopies of gore construction, should rapidly open the canopy, initially at the skirtthereby compelling the canopy to fill from the skirt upwards to the apex in a rapid filling sequence. The partially entrapped column of air, in the compartment defined between an external gore and the canopy gore which it covers.increases the buoyancy of the canopy since the upper end of this compartment is closed and the lower end is open. An anti oscillation vent or slot may be provided in the device to effectively eliminate oscillation common to conventional circular canopy designs. For example, excellent canopy balance may be achieved by the construction of external gore coverings on every fourth gore on a 28 gore canopy, and every sixth gore on a 30 gore canopy a beginning with either gore number 1 or the highest numbered gore. In order that the present invention may more readily be understood the following description is given a merely by way of example a with reference to the accompanying drawings in which FIGURE 1 shows a just deployed conventional canopy FIGURE 2 shows a canopy in accordance with the present invention in the same just deployed state FIGURE 3 shows schematically the folded skirt of a conventional parachute in the packed state FIGURE 4 shows the action of two inflation assisting devices on gores 14 and 28 FIGURE 5 shows the action of a further two inflation assistance devices on gores 7 and 21 FIGURE 6 shows a side elevational view of a conventional gore FIGURE 7 is a side elevational view of the parachute inflation assistance device used to cover the gore of Figure 6 FIGURE 8 shows an elevational view of the inflation assistance device on an inflated canopy FIGURE 9 shows the air flow access opening of the inflation assistance device at the canopy skirt and FIGURE 10 illustrates the location of the antioscillation vent slot of the inflation assistance device. Figure 1 illustrates a conventional canopy while in the elongated just deployed configuration and shows the air flow 1 at the canopy skirt creating an air turbulence eddy 2 on the exterior of the canopy. Figure 2 illustrates the air flow pattern during activation of a parachute inflation assistance device on the canopy in accordance with this invention. Figure 3 is exaggerated, but reveals the interior of a conventional parachute at the skirt a after packing or in the very early post deployment state. The numbers 14 and 28 are gore numbers assigned at time of original canopy manufacture. Figure 4 illustrates the inflation assistance device in the form of an additional gore 3 on a canopy in accordance with this invention a beginning to open as line stretch occurs a the arrows indicating the direction of pull away from the centre of the folded canopy skirt. Figure 5 shows further inflation assistance additional gores 3 on gores numbers 7 and 21 pulling in opposed directions along a line of action which is perpendicular to that of the devices 3 on gores 1 and 28, as indicated by the arrows. Figures 3, 4 and 5 together explain the action of pulling open the skirt by means of the exterior air inflation of the inflation assistance additional gores 3. Figure 6 is a side elevational view of a conventional gore 5 showing the apex opening at 4. Figure 7 is a side elevational view of the parachute inflation assistance additional gore 3 used to cover the gore 5 shown in Figure 6. As shown in Figures 6 and 7, the parachute inflation assistance gore 3 is formed of nylon fabric or other porous material and constitutes an additional gore covering a main parachute canopy gore. The additional gore 3 is designed for actuation by air turbulence 2 on the exterior surface of the canopy. This gore 3 extends from the apex hem 4 of the particular covered canopy gore 7 downwards to a point approximately 20 cm above the equator or skirt 8 of the canopy. The gore 3 forming the inflation assistance device is constructed of 1.1 oz. ripstop nylon or other low porosity material a and comprises four panel sections 5 cut on a 45 degree bias. These sections 5 are joined with diagonal seams 6 formed with nylon thread a size E using a 301 stitch a with 28 to 43 stitches per 10 cm length of seam on two parallel rows.The inflation assistance additional gore 3 is sized according to the gore 7 it will cover on a given canopy.This width will be calculated at the apex hem 4 at a ratio of 2 1 to the width of the gore 7 being covered and will flare along the radial seams of sections 5 to a point 20 cm above the canopy skirt 8 where the ratio of the width of the assistance gore 3 to that of the canopy gore 7 is 1.22 1. When constructing my assistance device for attachment to a previously manufactured parachute canopy it is advisable to allow a 12.5 cm excess of material along the radial seams so that an EnglishFell seam of 6.5 mm will be employed. The radial seams are then joined using a nylon thread size Ea with a 301 stitch a pitched at 28 to 43 stitches per 10 cm length of seam in double rows on both sides of the suspension line channels. The additional gore 3 forming the inflation assistance device 3 is closed at the apex end 13 Figure 8 in the same manner. The attachment of retention lines 10 is described below. In the manufacture of new canopies the normal canopy gore 7 and the inflation assistanCe add zonal gre 3 will be joined at the radial sarns wit encii Fell seam in the same manner as above. The skirt of the inflation assistance device is reinforced with one inch 2.5 cm wide nylon taper folded longitudinally along its median line a and utilising nylon thread and a 301 stitch a stitched in four rows with 28 to 43 stitches per 10 cm length of seam. The retention lines 10 of the inflation assistance device 3 are taken from suspension line stock rated at 250 Kg. tensile strength. Attachment of this retention line 10 at the skirt is accomplished 10 cm to the left and to the right of the 90 centre or longitudinal centre of the inflation assistance device 3 as shown in Figure 9 utilising nylon tape 0.5 inch 1.25 cm wide x 2.5 inches 6.35 cm long to form a V tab. The retention line is laid on the skirt a covered with the tapea and then sewn with nylon thread size Ea using 308 stitch with six rows and 28 to 43 stitches per 10 cm length of seam. Figure 8, illustrates one installed assistance additional gore 3 on an inflated canopy. The additional gore 3 begins at the apex end 13 where it is closed. Also Figure 8 shows the location of the vent slot 11 and the junctions of attachment 11 of retention lines 10 to the inflation assistance gore 3 and to the suspension lines 9. Figure 9 shows in greater detail the air flow access opening of the inflation assistance gore 3 and the attachment of the retention lines 10 of the inflation assistance gore 3 to the canopy suspension lines 9. Figure 10. illustrates the inflation assistance gore 3 and the placement of the antioscillation vent slot 11. The length of the retention line 10 will be 76 cm on a conical or a flat circular canopy and 112 cm on a hemispherical canopy. The retention line 10 will be attached to the suspension line 9 by a finger trap 1.25 cma utilising a 308 stitch, nylon thread, with 28 to 43 stitches per 10 cm length of seam. It will thus be seen that a by virtue of transfer of tension from the lower portion of the inflation assistance device 3 forming the mouth of the device a the retention lines 10 prevent the mouth of the inflation assistance device from blowing back at high deployment velocities or laying down on the gores at low deployment velocities.Thus this lower portion is in the form of a constant arca as shown in Figures 8 and 9. This also prevents the air turbulence eddy 2 from jumping over the lower end of the device 3 to locate itself above the air inlet mouth of the device. An anti oscillation vent slot 11, shown inFigure 10 is provided for release of air captured in the inflation assistance device. This air escape vent is a slit 6.5 mm wide, 12.7 cm long and is located astride the or longitudinal centre line of the external gore, beginning 96 cm down from the apex hem.It is reinforced with 1.25 cm wide nylon tape, longitudinally folded along its centre line and attached with a 301 stitch nylon thread size Ea with double rows of 28 to 43 stitches per 10 cm length of seam. From the foregoing it will be seen that there is provided an inflation assistance device for parachutes which may be used for the transport of humans or of other loads from an aircraft a balloon or the like to the ground. The conventional flat circular canopy and the hemispherical or conical canopy some with extended skirts a open slowly as air enters the air channel and travels to the apex of the parachute a whereby the volume increasingly spreads the canopy open downward to the juncture of the skirt and suspension lines. This is a time consuming process and will not occur while the canopy is transverse to the relative air flow.With the improved inflation assistance device proposed in accordance with the present invention the inflation rate is significantly increased a regardless of the orientation of the canopy axis by capturing the air turbulence existing on the exterior of the canopy above the skirt thereby providing a life saving capability at 60 metres regardless of the orientation of the canopy axis. Also. the low altitude rate of descent of the load is significantly reduced by in excess of 45 per cent since the external gores entrap additional air about the canopy. At the same time the canopies are strengthened thereby significantly eliminating flattening effect during rebound. Furthermore, oscillation is reduced to 2 degrees on flat a circular and hemispherical canopies where maximum oscillations of 30 degrees are specified as inherent design limitations. A still further advantage is that the inflation assistance device provides for multidirectional opening of the skirt of the canopy immediately, thereby separating the suspension lines and the fabric and in so doing significantly reduces the opportunity for canopy malfunction through line fabric entanglements and inversion of the skirt area fabric upward into the interior of the canopy.
