# Pneumatic tires comprising an improved tread.

## Abstract
A pneumatic tire comprising an improved tread has a tread composed of a rubber composition comprising from 10 120 parts by weight of carbon black having an iodine adsorption number of not less than 36 mg g and a dibutyl phthalate adsorption number of not less than 60 ml 100 g from 0.4 to 5 parts by weight of a vulcanizing agent and 100 parts by weight of a rubber component consisting of from 40 100 parts by weight of a styrene butadiene copolymer rubber and from 0 to 60 parts by weight of one or more diene rubbers other than said styrene butadiene rubber which has a bound styrene content S of from 10 to 30 by weight and a 1,2 bond content in the butadiene portion V of from 40 to 70 by weight, such that 65 1.7S V 100, and contains not more than 10 by weight, based on the weight of bound styrene, of styrene sequences consisting of not less than 11 styrene monomer units and not less than 80 by weight of, based on the weight of bound styrene, of styrene sequences consisting of not more than 5 styrene monomer units.
