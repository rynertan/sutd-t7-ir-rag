# A MULTI IMAGE OBJECT RECOGNITION SYSTEM

## Abstract
Apparatus for optically recognizing the configuration of several differently configurated workpieces simultaneously, uses an image comparison technique and a reference negative transparency containing a plurality of two dimensional images of different workpieces to be recognized. The reference ne gative transparency comprises a multi image transparency mask produced from photographic film. An array of light responsive photocells develops output signals indicative of the degree of correspondence between the image of an object which is superimposed on the mask and each of the image transparencies of the mask. The output signals developed by each of the photocells is compared with stored information to identify the object being viewed.
