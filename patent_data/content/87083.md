# Gauge control method and apparatus for multi roll rolling mill.

## Abstract
Gauge control method and apparatus for a multi roll type upright rolling mill includes displaceable rolls 4, 5 which are movable not only in a first direction in which a material to be rolled 1 is compressed but also in the axial direction thereof or in a direction in which the axis of the displaceable roll is inclined at a variable angle ϑ relative to other rolls 2, 3 6, 7 as viewed in a horizontal plane, the other rolls 2, 3 6, 7 being movable in the first direction. Position of δ, ϑ the displaceable rolls 4, 5 is detected, and in dependence on the displacement δ, ϑ of the displaceable roll, coefficient of mill stiffness K of the whole rolling mill and those M among the individual rolls are arithmetically determined, A roll gap S defined between the rolis 2, 3 serving for rolling work is arithmetically determined on the basis of the arithmetically determined coefficients of stiff ness K, M, a rolling load P and roll bending forces Q applied to the individual rolls 2, 3 4, 5 6, 7 detected by respective detectors 10, 12, 14 . Rolling reduction set by a screw down device 23 of the rolling mill is controllably regulated in dependence on the roll gap S . A high precision gauge control is realized by considering variations in the coefficients of mill stiffness K, M brought about by the roll shifts and changes in the roll bending forces Q .
