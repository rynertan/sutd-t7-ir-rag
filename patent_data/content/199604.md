## Description
This invention relates to a processing method of a light sensitive silver halide color photographic material hereinafter abbreviated to as light sensitive material , particularly to a processing method which processes with a processing solution substituted for washing using a small amount of water during a washing treatment which uses a large amount of water processed after a bleach fixing processing. In recent years, in a photofinisher which is carried out a development processing of a light sensitive material automatically and continuously, problems of environmental preservation and water resources are granted as important and it has earnestly been desired to diminish or become zero a small amount of washing water used in a washing treatment successively processed after bleach fixing processing. Thus, methods in which an amount of washing water used with a large amount is diminished are provided and it has been known a method as a technique in which an amount of washing water is to be made small by constituting washing tanks to a multi layered and by flowing water backward as described in West German Patent No. 2,920,222 specifica tion and S.R. Goldwasser, Water flow rate in immersion washing of motionpict ure film , Jour. SMPTE, A pre bath of such a stabilizing treatment contains a thiosulfate, and a staying time of processing solutions used in these processing is extremely prolonged when the aforesaid pre washing using a small amount of washing water or a multi stage countercurrent washing using a small amount of washing water is carried out or when a processing substituted for water washing processed by supplementing a small amount of supplmenting solution is carried out without carrying out a washing processing using large amount of washing water, after a bleach fixing processing which solution contains the above thiosulfate. Accordingly, it exists a disadvantage that fine black precipitates will likely be generated in the processing solution during preservation or allowed to stand. In order to eliminate such a disadvantage, as a method in which precipitation of sulfates during washing processing is to be prevented, there is known a technique of adding a polyalkyleneoxide series nonionic active agent in a washing tank as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,059,446. Further, a technique in which an isothiazoline or benz isothiazoline compound is added in a washing water is known as disclosed in Japanese Provisional Patent Publication No. 8542 1982. However, prevention effects of the above techniques are insufficient and further a technique in which there is no problems concerning staying in the washing water and the stabilizing processing solution has been desired. Further, when a supplementing amount of a proceesing substituted for the washing is more diminished or when a processing time is made short, there is a disadvantage that a concentration of a bleach fixing component in the final tank of the stabilizing solution substituted for the washing is increased whereby a yellow stain at an unexposed portion of the light sensitive material is increased due to a long period of preservation. Moreover, there is a disadvantage that a contamination substance is remained at an unexposed portion just after the processing, and in such a case, if the light sensi tive material is a printing paper, contamination at a white portion becomes serious problems since the unexposed portion of the printing paper is a white ground. Further, it is always required by a user that the processing is carried out rapidly. Accordingly, a first object of the present invention is to provide a processing method of a light sensitive silver halide color photographic material, which can prevent black precipitates occured during preservation or with a lapse of time in a stabilizing solution substi tuted for a water washing. A second object of the present invention is to provide a processing method of a light sensitive silver halide color photographic material, which can prevent an increment of yellow stain of an unexposed portion of a light sensitive material due to preservation for a long period of time even when a supplementing amount of a stabilizing solution substituted for a water washing is decreased. A third object of the present invention is to provide a processing method of a light sensitive silver halide color photographic material, which can prevent an occurence of the aforesaid white ground contamination at an unexposed portion. A fourth object of the present invention is to provide a rapid processing method of a light sensitive silver halide color photographic material. The above objects are accomplished by a processing method of a light sensitive silver halide color photographic material which comprises, in a method of processing a light sensitive silver halide color photographic material with a bleach fixing solution after color developing, and successively with a stabilizing solution substituted for a water washing, said bleach fixing solution contains as main components an organic acid ferric complex salt with which a molecular weight of a free acid being not more than 280, a thiosulfate and a sulfite, and a processing time by said stabilizing solution substituted for a water washing is 2 minutes or shorter. In the following, the present invention will be explained in more detail. Heretofore, an organic ferric complex salt has been known as a bleaching agent employed for a bleach fixing solution, and in the conventional bleach fixing solution using a thiosulfate as a fixing agent and a sulfite as a preservative, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ferric salt has been used as the organic ferric salt. The reason why the ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ferric salt is employed is because it is preferred in the points of desilvering characteristics, recoloration and preserva bility of the solution of the bleach fixing solution. Accordingly, a processing in which a washing processing which uses a large amount of water and is successively treated after a processing step due to a bleach fixing solution has been replaced by a processing step due to a stabilizing solution substituted for a water washing processed with a small amount of an aqueous solution has been used as a next tank following to a processing step due to a bleach fixing solution using ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid ferric salt as a bleaching agent. In such a system, it has occured problems that preserva bility with a lapse of time of the aforesaid stabilizing solution substituted for washing is bad, a yellow stain has occured at an unexposed portion of a light sensitive material to be processed and a contamination at an unexposed white portion will likely be caused. The present inventors have intensively studied concerning the above problems, and as a result, surprisingly, it has found that by using an organic ferric salt having a molecular weight of a free acid being not more than 280 as a bleaching agent of a bleach fixing solution and by setting a processing time using a stabilizing solution substituted for washing for 2 minutes or less, the above technical tasks have been solved and has accomplished the present invention. That is, effects of the present invention have obtained by the reason as stated below. It is considered that by using a bleaching agent of the present invention dissolu tion of a component which makes increase yellow stain generated by the storage has been accelarated, effusion of a contamination preventive agent for a white portion for example, a fluorescent brightening agent added at a procuding procedure or containd at a color developing step in a light sensitive material eluted in a stabiliz ing solution substituted for washing, an improving agent for image preservation and the like is little since short time processing, and as a result, increase of yellow stain due to preservation at a lapse of time and contami nation of an unexposed white portion have been prevented. Further, they have found that the effects have particu larly markedly revealed when the organic acid ferric salt is a compound represented by the formula I and in such a system to be containd compounds represented by the formulae II to V in the light sensitive material is extremely preferred for prevention of yellow stain and contamination of white portion due to the above preserva tion.

Color paper samples were prepared in the same manner as in Example 1 except for replacing the magenta coupler in the color paper used in Example 1 with the magenta coupler as shown in Table 6 below and developing processings were carried out following the processing steps of Example 1. At the same time, as comparative processings, the proces sing which was carried out the stabilizing processing in place of the stabilizing processing substituted for water washing. With respect to samples for the stabilizing processing and the flowing water washing processing concerning the obtained respective Samples No. 55 to No. 76 of the light sensitive materials, by alternating a degradation accelerating test using a high humidity and high tempera ture at 70 C and 50 RH and a degradation accelerating test using a xenon arc lamp evry other day, they were preserved for 4 weeks. Magenta dye densities before and after preservation were measured with red light using a photodensitometer PDA 65 produced by Konishiroku Photo Industry Co., Ltd. to obtain fading rates of the magenta dye. The results are shown in Table 6. The comparative magenta couplers 1 and 2 are the same used as in Example 6. As clearly seen from the results of Table 6, the light sensitive materials of Samples No. 62, No. 63, No. 68 to No. 73, No. 75 and No. 76 of this invention which contain the magenta coupler in accordance with the present invention and processed with the bleach fixing solution containing the chelating agent of ferric salt having low molecular weight as the bleaching agent are extremely excellent in low magenta dye fading retes, and particu larly preferred in case of using the ferric complex salt of free acid represented by the formula I as the bleaching agent. According to the method of the present invention, when the staying time of the stabilizing solution substituted for water washing in the processing method processing with the stabilizing solution substituted for water washing succesively processing with the bleach fixing solution containing thiosulfate is long, generation of fine black precipitates which generate in said solution can be prevented. Further, generation of yellow stain when preserved for a long time a photographic image which is made a processing with a decreased amount of supple menting stabilizing solution substituted for water washing and occurrence of edge contamination can also be prevented.
