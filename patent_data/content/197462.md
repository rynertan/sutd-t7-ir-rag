# Capacitive position transducer.

## Abstract
A capacitive position transducer for detecting position changes or producing position feed back signals in a servo recorder comprises a rhombic sender electrode 10 con nected to a voltage source and a plurality of rectangular receiver electrodes 11 18 insulated from and adjacent to each other. Current flowing through the coupled transmitting and receiver electrodes is rectified by diodes circuits D₁ D₈, D ₁ D ₈ and then flows through a serialconnected resistor circuit R₀ R₇ thereby to form an output voltage signal at the ends of the resistor circuit. The linearity of the output voltage signal can be changed by changing the value of the resistor in the resistor circuit. The capacitive positive transducer can also provide the commutating signals required by brushless linear motor.
