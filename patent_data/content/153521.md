# Vehicle body tilting system.

## Abstract
The system is responsive both to lateral acceleration of the vehicle and to steering movements. The mechanism includes tilt actuator means 11 and tilt control means 12 governed by a gravity sensitive device 22 and a device 25 27 responsive to steering movement. The system main tains the vehicle body substantially in line with the resultant vector of gravity and centripetal acceleration while corner ing. The steering input accelerates the response of the mechanism to changes of direction of the vehicle.
