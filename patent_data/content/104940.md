## Description
3 ARYL 5, 6 DIHYDRO 1,4, 2 OXATHIAZINES AND THEIR OXIDES This invention relates to derivatives of 3 aryl 5, 6 dihydro1,4,2 oxathiazines and their oxides, and to the use of such derivatives as herbicides, fungicides, and plant dessicants and defoliants. The invention also relates to methods of preparing these chemicals. Dihydro 1,4 ,2 oxathiazines are little known in the chemical literature. A multi substituted compound, N 5,6 dihydro 5,6 dimethyl 3 phenyl 1 14, 2 oxathiazine 6 yl acetamide, was reported inTetrahedron Letters, 1972, p. 5267, and a tetrahydro compound was described in J. Org. Chem. 30 949 1965 . However, no utility was disclosed for these compounds. The chemicals of this invention are represented by the general formulae below, and possess herbicidal activity, fungicidal activity and plant desiccating and defoliating activities.EMI1.1 wherein n is 0, 1 or 2, R1 is hydrogen, C1 C4 linear or branched alkyl or benzyl, and R has one of the following values phenyl or naphthyl phenyl substituted with 1 or 2 of the following groups hydroxyl halo C1 C12 alkyl C5 C6 cycloalkyl trihalomethyl phenyl C1 C alkoxy or alkylthio tetrahydropyranyloxy phenoxy C2 C5 alkylcarbonyl phenylcarbonyl C1 C4 alkylsulfinyl C1 Cv alkylsulfonyl carboxy or its alkali metal salt C2 C5 alkoxycarbonyl C2 C5 alkylaminocarbonyl phenylaminocarbonyl tolylaminocarbonyl morpholinocarbonyl amino nitro cyano or dioxolanyl pyridinyl thienyl provided n is not 2 furanyl furanyl substituted with 1 to 3 of the following groups C1 C4 alkyl and C2 C5 alkoxycarbonyl. In preferred compounds of the foregoing formula, R1 is hydrogen or C1 C4 linear or branched alkyl and R has one of the following values phenyl phenyl substituted with 1 2 of the following groups F, Cl, Br, except not 2 Cl or 2,4 Cl2 if n is 2 C1 C4 except p t alkyl if n is zero CF3 phenyl except if n is 2 C1 C5 alkoxy C2 C5 alkylcarbonyl C2 C5 alkoxycarbonyl except 4 alkoxycarbonyl if n is zero amino nitro or cyano 3 or 4 pyridinyl provided n is not 2 thienyl provided n is not 2 furanyl furanyl substituted with 1 to 3 of the following groups methyl or C2 C3 alkoxycarbonyl. 1 In more preferred compounds of the above formula, R is hydrogen or methyl and R has one of the following values phenyl provided n is not 2 phenyl substituted with 1 or 2 of the following groups F, Cl, Br, but not 2 Cl or 2,4 Cl2 if n is 2 n cl c4 alkyl CF3 C1 C2 alkoxy C2 C5 alkylcarbonyl, provided n is 1 C2 C3 alkoxycarbonyl provided n is 1 or 2 nitro or cyano 3 or 4 pyridinyl provided n is 0 or 1 thienyl provided n is 0 or 1 furanyl furanyl substituted with 1 to 3 methyl groups1 provided n is 1 or 2. Compounds of the invention may be used for control of various grasses and broadleaved weeds including pigweed Amaranthus retroflexus L. , velvetleaf Abutilon theophrasti Medic. , jimsonweed Datura stramonium L. , tall morning glory Ipomoea purpurea L. Roth , barnyardgrass Echinochloa crusgalli L. Beauv. , green foxtail Setaria viridis L. Beauv. giant foxtail Setaria faberi Herrm. , crabgrass Digitaria ischaemum Schreb. Muhl. and switchgrass Panicum virgatum L. . Chemical harvest aids are used for a wide variety of primary effects, including the defoliation of the crop plant the desiccation of its leaves, stems, and other aerial organs the control of late season regrowth e.g. cotton the concentration of crop maturity providing more efficient harvesting. Under normal conditions, many crop plants do not mature uniformly or in a timely fashion, so that efficient, optimum harvest is difficult, either due to equipment scheduling or to weather.Crops such as cotton, potato, sunflower, seed legumes and other oilseed crops require either desiccation or defoliation before harvest can be effectively accomplished. Cotton is an example of a crop with a long history of successful harvest aid use. When cotton is adequately defoliated, mechanical pickers can operate more effectively. If the crop is not defoliated, the leaves can interfere with the picking mechanism. Also, leaves can contaminate the cotton lint with trash or green stain, which reduces the quality of the fiber or reduces the efficiency of the ginning process. Likewise, potato vines need to be desiccated for efficient mechanical digging. In addition, upon desiccation of potato leaves and haulms, the tuber skin matures and becomes less susceptible to damage from the digger and post harvest handling.Seed legumes and sunflowers are also mechanically harvested, and this process is facilitated if the leaves are removed or desiccated. As with cotton and potato, such defoliation or desiccation also ripens the seed uniformly, accelerates the rate of fruit maturation, and conditions the pod or head for easy harvest. Compounds of this invention have been found to have surprising utility as harvest aid chemicals. Specifically, when applied to the foliage of crop species, they cause desiccation and or defoliation of the leaves, can cause desirable changes in the fruiting form e.g. cotton boll , and may alter the re growth of the plant. Applications of the compounds may be in the form of aqueous solutions or suspensions applied to the target tissue. Compounds of this invention may be used alone, in combination with one or more other oxathiazine derivative described here, or as a tank mix with other harvest aid chemical compounds or spray adjuvants such as surface active agents, stickers, emulsifiers, or extenders . In addition, the chemicals described for this invention possess antifungal properties which are useful for the control of plant diseases such as Rice Blast, Bean Rust, Tomato Early Blight, Cercospora Leaf Spot or similar diseases. Growth inhibition tests indicate a broad spectrum of activity against other disease producing fungi such as Alternaria, Sclerotium, Piricularia, Pythium,Phytophthora, Fusarium. Two methods of synthesizing the chemicals of this invention have been discovered. One of these is outlined in Scheme I below and utilizes aromatic aldehydes as starting materials. SCHEME IEMI5.1 N hydroxyarylcarboximidoyl chloride II is treated with 2 chloroethanethiol in the presence of two equivalents of base or suitable hydrogen chloride scavenger to produce 3 aryl 5, 6dihydro 1,4,2 oxathiazine I, n 0 . The II intermediate may be readily made by known methods by converting an aldehyde of the formula RCHO to its corresponding oxime RCH NOll in the presence of H2NOH and subsequent chlorination with chlorine or t butyl hypochlorite in methylene chloride or chloroform as the solvent. If only one equivalent of base is used, the intermediate 2 chloroethyl N hydroxybenzene carboximidothioate derivative is isolated. This intermediate will give the oxathiazine when treated with a base. Oxidation of oxathiazines with peroxyacetic acid or m chloroperoxybenzoic gives the oxides I, n 1 or 2 . Scheme II below outlines the second method of preparation, which uses arylcarbodithioate esters. SCHEME IIStep IEMI6.1 Step 2EMI6.2 X halogen Cl, Br, I Ib n zero R1 and R2 hydrogen, C1 C4 all or bSnzyl provided at least one of R and R is hydrogen Treatment of a carbodithioate ester IV with hydroxylamine results in the liberation of ethyl mercaptan and the formation ofN hydroxyarylthioamide Va which enolises to N hydroxyarylcarboximidothioic acid Vb . Formation of the oxathiazine is then accomplished by reacting with vicinal dihaloalkane,EMI6.3 R1 and X as previously described in the presence of two equivalents of base A minor impurity is sometimes obtained in this reaction.For example, when two molecules of N hydroxycarboximidothioic acid Vb react with one molecule of 1,2 dibromoethane, 1,2, ethanediyl bis N hydroxyarylcarboximidothioate is produced and can ba extracted from the reaction by washing with dilute aqueous sodium hydroxide. In Scheme I, the reaction of compound II with compound III for the preparation of the desired oxathiazine of this invention may be carried out at a temperature of minus 10 to plus 200C. Usually, the reaction takes about 0.5 6 hours for completion but ordinarily does not take longer than 3 hours. In Scheme II, the Step I reaction is performed at from 0 to 300C, usually at 10 250C, and it may take 0.5 2 hours, generally 0.5 1 hour to form the Va Vb equilibrium product. In Step 2, a temperature of 0 1000C may be employed although a 20 800C temperature range is more preferred. The reaction usually takes from 0.5 to 5 hours, but in many cases completion can be obtained within 3 hours. As solvents, C1 C10 aliphatic alcohols may be used or aprotic solvents such as dimethylformamide or dimethylsulfoxide. If so desired, intermediate compounds suitable for making the chemicals of this invention may be prepared having the structural formula RC NOH SCH2CH2C1 by using Scheme I of this invention wherein R has the meanings of claim 1, R1 is hydrogen and n is 0, using only one equivalent of base such as alkali metal C1 C10 alkoxide, alkylamines, alkanolamines, pyridine, morpholine and similar organic bases.

For herbicidal applications, compounds of this invention may be added as a tank mix to other herbicide solutions so that the number of different weed species controlled in a single application will be increased. The procedures for using the present oxathiazine derivatives as herbicides may be in accordance with conventional agricultural practice. The chemicals are ordinarily applied as formulations containing b carrier and or surface active agent. The formulation may contain more than one of the described oxathiazine derivatives if desired other active herbicides may be included in the formula tion as well. Thus, the chemical may be impregnated on finely divided or granular inorganic or organic carriers such as attapulgite clay sand, vermiculite, ground corn cobs, activated carbon or other granular carriers known to the art. The impregnated granules may then be spread on the soil as preemergence herbicides. Furthermore, the chemical may be formulated as wettable powders by grinding them into a fine powder and mixing them with an inactive powdered carrier to which a surface active dispersing agent has been added. Typical powdered solid carriers are the various mineral silicates, e.g., mica, talc, pyrophyllite and clays. The wettable powder may then be dispersed in water and sprayed on the soil surface or weeds. Similarly, soluble or emulsifiable concentrate may be prepared by first dissolving the chemical in a solvent.The choice of solvent depends on the solubility of the particular chem ical Commonly used solvents are acetone, methyl ethyl ketone,C1 C8 alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, butanol, hexanol and 2 ethylhexanol toluene, xylene, chloroform, furfuryl alcohol, phenol, naphtha, petroleum ether, kerosene or other aliphatic cycloaliphatic or aromatic solvents. Usually, a surface active agent or dispersant is added to the solvent. The resultant concentrate is then dispersed in water and applied by spraying. Suitable surface active agents and dispersants are well known to those skilled in the art and reference may be had to McCutcheon s Detergents andEmulsifiers, 1980, Allured Publishing Corp., Ridgewood, NewJersey or Hoffman et al.U.S. patents 2,614,916, cols, 2 to 4 and 2,547,724, cols, 3 and 4, for example of appropriate surface active agents. The concentration of active chemical in the formulation may vary widely, e.g., from 1 to 95 . For use as a preemergence herbicide, the chemical is applied to soil which contains weed and crop seed either to the surface of the soil or incorporated into the upper 2.5 to 7.6 cm of soil . The most suitable rate of application in any given case will depend on such factors as soil type, soil pH, soil organic matter content, the quantity and intensity of rainfall before and after treatment, the air and soil temperature, light intensity and light duration per day. All of these factors have an influence on the efficacy of the chemicals for use as herbicides. Example 18 To illustrate herbicide efficacy of the described 3 aryl 5,6 dihydro 1,4,2 oxathlazines, 600 mg chemical was dissolved in 10 ml organic solvent to which 30 mg conventional emulsifying agent e.g., ethoxylated sorbitan monolaurate Tween 20 jtrademarkl was added in most cases acetone was used as the solvent. The solution was diluted to 100 ml with distilled water. Twenty milliliters of this 6000 ppm solution was diluted to 250 ppm with distilled water.The chemical was applied at the rate of 11.2 kg ha kilograms per hectare by drenching 46 ml of the 250 ppm solution on the surface of soil in 11.4 cm diameter plastic pots which had been sown with the following weed seeds velvetleaf Abutilon theophrastiMedic. or rough pigweed Amaranthus retroflexus L. , jimsonweed Datura stramonium L. , tall morningglory Ipomea purpurea L. Roth , crabgrass Digitaria ischaemum Schreb. Muhl or switchgrass Panicum virgatum L. , barnyardgrass Echinochloa crusgalli L. Beauv. and giant foxtail Setaria faberi Herrm. or green foxtail Setaria viridis L. Beauv. . The percent control of the weeds compared to untreated checks was determined two weeks after treatment. TABLE 5 shows the results with the preemergence herbicides of the invention prepared in accordance with the above examples. Example 19 To illustrate effectiveness of the described oxathiazines as postemergence herbicides, the 6000 ppm solutions described underExample 18 were atomized with a number 152 DeVilbiss trademark sprayer, wetting the foliage to the drip point. The weeds, which are the same species as described under Example 18, were treated six days after emergence. The percent control was evaluated two weeks after treatment. TABLE 6 shows the results with postemer gence herbicides of the invention.

The active ingredient s may be included in one or more formulations suitable for use in conventional application equipment. Such formulations may be of several different physical and chemical types, any of which could be made by anyone familiar with the art. For instance, the active ingredient s may be formulated into a soluble or emulsifiable concentrate that is prepared by dissolving the active ingredient s in one or more suitable solvents, such as acetone, toluene, or other aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon, to which a dispersing agent has been added. Alternatively, the active ingredient s may be formulated as a wettable powder by grinding it into a fine powder and mixing it with an inactive powdered carrier, to which a dispersing agent has been added. Typical inactive powdered carriers include attapulgite clay, vermiculite, talc, corn cob, activated carbon, mica and pyrophyllite. Alternatively, a wettable powder may be formu lated by spraying a solution of the active ingredient s in organic solvent onto the surface of an inactive powdered carrier as it is blended. The solvent is subsequently allowed to vaporize. The concentration of the active ingredient s in formulations of all types may vary widely, ranging from 0.1 to 95 active ingredient by weight. Formulations bearing the active ingredient s may be dispersed in water and applied to target plants. Surface active agents may be added to the applied solution to increase its qualitative or quantitive range of activity. Suitable surface active agents are well known to those skilled in the art. Reference may be made toMcCutcheon s Detergents and Emulsifiers 1980, Allured Publ. Co.,Ridgewood, NJ or to Hoffman et al in U.S. Patents 2,614,916 cols. 2 to 4 and 2,574,724 cols. 3 and 4 for examples of appropriate surface active agents. The most suitable dosage of application of the active ingredient s and the type and amount of adjuvant substances to be added to the spray solution will depend on a number of factors, including the specific biological effect desired the air and soil temperature the quantity and intensity of rainfall before and after treatment the soil type, pH, fertility and moisture content the physiological condition and vigor of the target plants the relative humidity and wind velocity of the air around the crop the extent and density of the foliar canopy of the target plant the light quality, intensity and duration each day and the type and interval of previous and subsequent crop protectant chemical applications. All of these factors may have an influence on the efficacy of chemicals applied as harvest aids.Example 20 To illustrate the effectiveness of the described oxathiazines as crop plant desiccants, a 6000 ppm solution suspension of active ingredient was made up as described in Example 18. The chemical solutions suspensions were applied to soybean 1 and cotton 2 1 Glycine max L. Merr. cv. Williams 2 Gossypium hirsutum L. cv. Stoneville 213 plants as in Example 19. After 3 weeks in the greenhouse, the plants were scored for leaf desiccation on a 0 to 100 scale, 0 being no damage and 100 being complete kill. A rating system suggested by Frans and Talbert 1977. Research Methods in Weed Science, 2nd edition, Southern Weed Science Society was used as a guide.The data obtained appear in Table 7.

The solution was diluted to 100 ml with distilled water containing about 2000 ppm w v surface active agent e.g., Tween 20s . Twenty five 25 ml of this 6000 ppm solution suspension were diluted to 100 ml with distilled water containing about 2000 ppm surface active agent, resulting in a 1500 ppm solution suspension of test chemical.The chemical was applied to cotton plants Gossypium hirsutum L. Stoneville 213 by immersion of the lower leaves. At the time of treatment, the cotton plants had 2 to 4 true leaves. After treatment, the plants were returned to the greenhouse for about two weeks, at which time the plants were evaluated for defoliation of the treated leaves.

In fungicidal applications, the chemicals may be applied directly to plants i.e. seeds, foliage or to soil in which plants are growing or to be grown, to protect against the harmful effects of pathogenic fungi. For example, the chemical may be applied to seeds by tumbling the chemical with the seeds, either alone or in admixture with a powdered solid carrier. Typical powdered solid carriers are the various mineral silicates, e.g., mica, talc, pyrophyllite, and clays. The chemical may also be applied to the seeds in admixture with a conventional surface active wetting agent, with or without additional powdered solid carrier, as by first wetting the mixture with a small amount of water and then tumbling the seeds in the scurry. The surface active wetting agents that may be used with the fungicide may be any of the conventional anionic, non ionic, or cationic surface active agents. Such surface active agents are well known and reference is made to U.S. Patent No. 2,546,724, columns 3 and 4, for detailed examples of the same. As a seed protectant, the amount of the chemical coated on the seeds will be 1 4 to 12 oz. 7 350 g per hundred Ibis. 45.5 kg of the seed.As a soil treatment for fungi, the chemical may be applied a as a dust in admixture with sand or soil a powdered solid carrier such as a mineral silicate, with or without an additional surface active wetting agent, to the furrows simultaneously with the planting of the seeds or b an aqueous spray, if desired including a surface active or dispersing agent, or a surface active or dispersing agent and a powdered solid carrier, to the seed rows before, or with, or after planting the seeds. As a soil treatment, the amount of the chemical applied to the seed rows will be from 0.1 to 10 pounds per acre 0.112 to 11.2 kg ha based on rows 2 5 cm wide and 2 5 cm deep a distance of 40 102 cm apart.Also, as a soil treatment, the chemical may be applied broadcast using a similar dust or aqueous spray with an application rate of 1.0 to 100 pounds per acre 1.12 to 112 kg ha . As a foliage treatment, the chemical may be applied to growing plants at a rate of 1 4 to 10 pounds per acre 0.28 to 11.2 kg ha . Such application is generally as an aqueous spray which also contains a surface active or dispersing agent, with or without a powdered solid carrier or hydrocarbon solvent. These sprays usually are repeated at time intervals ranging from three days to two weeks during the growing season.Typical formulations are as follows all percentages are by weight a Emulsifiable concentrate 48.1 Active Ingredient 11.1 Surfactant e.g., polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate 40.8 Xylene 100.0 Total b Wettable powder 75.0sL, Active Ingredient 2.0 Triton trademark X 120 2.0 Daxad trademark 11 21.0 Dixie clay 100.0 TotalTriton X 120 is an alkylaryl polyether alcohol 9 10 moles polyethylene oxide in dry powdered form 40 active on an insoluble carrier . The active ingredient in Triton X 120 is Triton X 100, which is a liquid nonionic surfactant isooctyl phenylpolyethoxyethanol, obtained by condensing the alkylphenylphenol with ethylene oxide .Daxad 11 is polymerized sodium salt of alkylnaphthalene sulfonic acid more particularly, the sodium salts of binaphthyl methane sulfonic acids obtained from naphthalene, sulfuric acid and formaldehyde, according to U.S. Patent 1,336,759, Schmidt, April 13, 1920 .Example 22 Foliage Spray Treatment for Control of Established Bean Rust disease caused by the fungus Uromyces phaseoli Although many chemicals will serve to protect plants from disease, it is often desirable to draw upon chemicals which have therapeutic properties to arrest the development of disease that has already become established. This example illustrates such properties. Two hundred 200 milligrams of chemical were dissolved in 20 ml of acetone and 60 mg of a surfactant such as Triton X 100.This preparation was diluted with 80 ml distilled water giving a chemical suspension of 2000 ppm. Further serial dilutions were prepared from this as desired. The chemical suspensions were sprayed on duplicate pots, each containing two snapbean plants which had, 48 hours prior to this, been inoculated with the bean rust fungus Uromyces phaseoli typica Arth. At the time of the chemical spray the bean plants had just begun to expand their first trifoliolate leaves. The test plants were then placed in a chamber for 24 hours at 750F 240C and 100 relative humidity. After this time the plants were returned to the greenhouse. About 10 days later the plants were scored for disease control, with the results shown in TABLE 9. TABLE 9 Bean Rust Disease Control by Foliar Application at 1000 ppm DISEASE COMPOUND CONTROL 29 95 28 90 5 95 Some plant injury at this dosage.Example 23 Foliar Spray for Protecting Tomato Plants from infection by the Early Blight Fungus, Alternaria solani Test procedure One gram of the chemical to be tested was ground with three ml of acetone and 50 mg of a non ionic surface active agent TritonX 100 . The acetone and surface active agent are known to be inactive in this biological test. The mixture was diluted with water, giving suspensions containing 500 and 2000 ppm of the chemical. These suspensions were sprayed on duplicate six inch ca. 15 cm tomato plants variety Clark s Early Special using a gun type sprayer. Twenty four hours later the treated and untreated check plants were inoculated with a suspension ofAlternaria solani spores by means of a 20 second spray from an atomizer sprayer delivery rate 1 ml per second .The plants were then kept overnight in a controlled chamber at a temperature of 750F 240C and 100e, relative humidity. In the morning the plants were transferred to the greenhouse. Three days later the disease was scored by comparing the number of disease lesions of the treated plants with the untreated control. The formula used to determine percent control is 100 Avg. no. lesions on treated plant X 100 percent control Avg. no. lesions on untreated plant The results are shown in TABLE 10.

The suspensions were sprayed on duplicate pots of clustered 7 day old barley plants variety Herta using a gun type sprayer. The plants were then placed in a greenhouse together with untreated check plants and allowed to dry. All test plants were inoculated with the fungus by spraying with a suspension ofPiricularia oryzae spores 20,000 40,000 spores ml to which a standard wetting agent has been added Tween 20, 6 drops 300 ml . After inoculation the plants were kept in a temperaturehumidity control chamber for 24 48 hours at 700F 210C to allow infection. Plants were then removed and placed in a 70 F 210C greenhouse to allow disease development. After 5 to 7 days, blast lesions appeared on the leaves. Disease control was evaluated by either counting lesions if infection was moderate or evaluating by a disease rating scale of 0 6 with 6 being severe disease. Percent control was computed by comparing the treatment scores with that of the untreated control TABLE 11 .

The chemicals of the invention were dissolved in acetone, and applied at 500 ppm to 13 mm antibiotic testing discs by dipping the discs in the test solutions. After drying, the treated discs were placed on an agar plate 4 per plate , then 7 mm plugs of mycelium of various fungi were placed on the center of the discs in such fashion that the fungus mat was in direct contact with the treated disc. The fungitoxic activity of the chemicals was measured by comparing growth colony radius of the fungus on the treated discs with that on untreated controls. Colony radius was measured when untreated controls reached 80 90 of the area available for growth on the plates. The fungi tested were Alternaria solani A ,Fusarium oxysporum F , Pythium sp. P and Sclerotium rolfsii S . The results are shown in TABLE 12.

The chemical suspensions were prepared in a manner described in Example 23. The suspensions were sprayed on duplicate pots of clustered one month old peanut plants variety Florrunner , using a gun type sprayer. After the plants were dried, they were inoculated with the fungus by spraying with a suspension of Cercospora arachidicola spores 20,000 spores ml to which a standard wetting agent had been added Tween 20, 6 drops 300 mi . Plants were placed in temperature humidity controlled chamber for 24 48 hours at 700F 210C to allow infection to be initiated. Plants were then removed from the chamber and transferred to a 700F 210C greenhouse to allow disease development. After about 21 days, symptoms had developed on the leaflets. Disease control was evaluated by counting lesions if infection was moderate or evaluating by a disease rating scale of 0 6, with 6 being severe disease. Percent control was computed by comparing the treatment scores with that of the untreated control. The results are shown in TABLE 13.
