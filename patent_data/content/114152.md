## Description
The present invention relates to an electric portable general purpose geared motor effective to be removably applied on hand operated apparatus tor making food pastes and the like. As it is known there are presently commercially available home apparatus for making or kneading rood pastes such as spaghetti , noodles, ravioli and the like which automatically carry out the kneading of the mentioned food products. Some apparatus, of the above mentioned type, consist of a base body, associated with an electric motor,provided for driving a kneading device,as well as a device for forming and cutting sheets of pastry. Kneading apparatus are also known comprising horizontal rollers for calendering and cutting the food paste or pastry and making ravioli,which apparatus also include a built in electric motor, for driving the mentioned calendering rollers as well as the cutting elements associated therewith. Hand operated apparatus are also co.nmercially available which generally comprise a bearing structure supporting the pastry sheet calendering rollers, the pastry sheet cutting rollers as well as the ravioli making device. Mhe mentioned pastry making apparatus are provided with a crank including, at one end thereor, a rotatable handle and, at the other end,a shaped clutch to be engaged with the driving rollers which are cornea with a corresponding housing to be driven by said hand operated crank. In particular the above apparatus are also provided with a restraining device, including a suitable clamp member, for affixing the to a working surface. It should be noted in this connection that the coupling of said apparatus to the working surrace is a very difficult operation ana that the manual driving of the crank requires a lot of energy and time. Moreover, since the driving of the rollers is of manual type,it will be hardly constant, thereby negatively arfecting the evenness or the produced pastry sheets. Accordingly, the task of the present invention is that of overcoming the above mentioned drawbacks by providing such a portable electric geared motor assembly which may be applied, in a simple and quick way, to the driving rollers or hand operated apparatus tor kneading and making rood pastry products. Within that task, it is a main object ol the present invention to provide such a portable electric geared motor assembly,ror application on hand operated kneading apparatus, therein there is eliminatea the problem or affixing the kneading apparatus on a working surface. Another obJect or the present invention is to provide such a portable electric geared motor assembly which may be properly appliea to any types of hand operated kneading ana pastry sheet making apparatus. Yet another object or the present invention is to proviae an interexchangeable type or portable electric geared motor assembly ror application to any types of hand operated kneading ana pastry making apparatus, which may De used either in succession or alternatively, thereby affording the possibility of making electrically operated mechanical assemblies. Yet another object of the present invention is to provide such a portable electric geared motor assembly effective to De applied to any known kneading apparatus tor making spaghetti ,ravioli, noodles ana the like. According to one aspect of the present invention, the above mentionea task and oDects,as well as yet other objects,which will become more apparent hereinafter, are achieved by a portable electric geared motor assembly, effective to be appliea on kneading apparatus, ravioli making apparatus and hand operated kneading ana pastry making apparatus tor driving the kneading and pastry making aevices of said apparatus,cflaracterizea in that it comprises an electric motor, cooperating with reducing gear memDers,the axle of the latter whereof ends with a shaped pin provided ror engaging with one of the rollers of said hand operated kneading apparatus and enclosed in an insulating hand engageable casing including a slide, said apparatus further including a guide for slidingly receiving said slide. turtner characteristics and advantages of the portable electric geared motor assembly tor application to pastry kneading and making apparatus according to the present invention will oecome more apparent hereinafter from the following detailea description of a preferred embodiment or said portable electric geared motor, Deing illustratea by way oP example and not of limitation in the rigures of the accompanying arawings,where rig.l is a longitudinal cross section view of the portable electric geared motor assembly according to the present invention fig.2 is a further longitudinal crosssection view of that same assembly, taken through a perpendicular plane to the preceding one figs. 3,4 ana 5 illustrate,respectively by side, front ant top views,a hana operated apparatus ror making pastry sheets and the luke figs. 6, and d illustrate the procedure for applying tne subject portable electric gearea motor assemDly to the above apparatus and figs.9 and 10 illustrate a kneading apparatus the structure whereof has been specirica designea tor receiving the portable electric gearea motor assembly according to the present invention, Dy suitable arfixing means. with reference to the above figures, the portable electric geared motor assembly according to the present invention comprises an electric motor I, cooperating with a plurality or reducing gear members 2 and enclosea,together with the latter, in a Dox shaped body or casing 3,made of an insulating material and so designed and arrangea as to be easily gripped The axle or shaft or one of the above mentioned reducing gear members is extended, outside from the casing 3,by a suitably shaped pin 4, erfective to De engaged with the housing or seat as conventionally formed in the roller 5 or a hand operated apparatus 6 ror making pastry or paste food products. On said apparatus, in particular, there is applied a guide 7,effective to slidingly receive a slide 8,arranged cantilever wise perimetrically of saio box like body or casing,3. It should be noted that the portable electric geared motor assembly according to the present invention is housed,by its pin or insert 4 in any working rollers and is effective to drive them independently from the different levels and spacings or said rollers, in the different types or apparatus. Moreover the guiae ana slide d rorm, jointly to said driving pin or insert, the secona ana third coupling points. The apparatus is couplea Dy simply inserting the driving pin into the seat or the preset working roller and housing the slide of the portable electric geared motor assembly into the guiae set on the apparatus the disengaging, for selecting other working rollers, is carried ut oy reversing the disclosed procedure. It shoula moreover De pointed out that the particular aesign or the Dox shapea Doay 3 and its rirm coupling to the apparatus, afford the possibility or using the latter without the need of affixing it to a bearing surrace. Higs.y ana 10 illustrate a further home use pastry kneading and making apparatus which also fOrms an integrating part of the electromechanical system driven by the portable electric geared motor assembly according to the present invention. More specifically the pastry kneading and making apparatus cooperating with the assembly according to the invention comprises a knot 11, mountea on a pin 13 supported Dy the casing of the kneading apparatus itself. he pin 13 supports a screw or scroll member 14,effective to rotate in a seat formed in the body or casing of the kneader 12 and closea Dy a cover member 15. The mentionea screw 14 is supportea by a shaIt 16,for receiving movement thereby. The kneaaer is moreover provided with lock washers 1 and a snap engaging ring member lo. To the body or casing or the kneader 12 there is applied the guiae effective to sliaingly receive the mentionea slide d associated with the portable electric geared motor assembly according to the present invention. While a preferred embodiment of the invention has been hereinabove disclosed, it should be noted that it is susceptible to several modirications and variations all whereor do not depart from the scope and spirit or the invention as aerinea in the accompanying claims.
