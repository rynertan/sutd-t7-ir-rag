# Thick film circuit board.

## Abstract
A thick film circuit board comprises at least parts of SiC substrate at which a thick film resistor is provided being coated with a glass layer having a good adhesion to the SiC substrate and the same or similar coefficient of thermal expansion as or to that of the SiC substrate, and no swelling, cracking and peeling appear on the thick film resistor and no electroconductive component is formed on laser trimmed parts of the thick film resistor.
