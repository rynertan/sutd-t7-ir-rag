## Description
BUTADIENE STyRENE N,N DIALKYLACRYLAMlDE TERPOLYMERS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the Invention This invention relates to a terpolymer containing a major proportion of butadiene together with minor amounts of styrene and N,N dialkylacrylamide. More specifically it relates to such terpolymers having excellent green strength and being suitable for incorporation in compositions used in tire manufacture and in related products.Related Prior Art No publications have been found which show terpolymers of butadiene, styrene and N,N dialkylacrylamides. Copolymers of styrene and N,N dimethylacrylamide DMA are known. For example, an article by G. Saini et al, which appeared in Die Makromolekulare Chemie 146 165 171 , describes the effect of various solvents on the copolymerization of DMA with styrene. However, no terpolymers are described. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In accordance with the present invention it has been found tat terolymers containing a major portion of butadiene, that is 60 87 percent by weight, preferably 65 80 percent of butadiene, and minor proportions of styrene and an N,N dialkylacrylamide may be prepared which have excellent green strength and are suitable for use in tire compositions. In these terpolymers the styrene proportion is advantageously 10 30 percent, preferably 15 25 percent by weight and the N,N dialkylacrylamide proportion is 1 15 percent, preferably 3 10 percent by weight. These terpolymers are advantageously prepared by emulsion polymerization using a free radical generating initiator, such as a peroxy compound, advantageously in combination with a reducing activator such as an alkyl amine. In place of the styrene, numerous homologous compounds may be used including vinyl toluene, alphamethylstyrene, vinyl naphthalene, p chloro styrene, p isopropylstyrene, p ethyl styrene, etc. Moreover, other conjugated dienes of 4 10 carbon atoms may be used in place of the butadiene including isoprene, 2,3 dimethyl butadiene, 2 phenyl butadiene, 2 chloro butadiene, 1,3 pentadiene, etc. The N,N dialkylacrylamides may be represented by the formula CH2 C R CON RX 2 wherein R represents hydrogen or methyl, in which case the basic structure is an acrylamide or a methacrylamide, R represents a divalent saturated aliphatic group of 1 7 carbon atoms, X represents hydrogen, halogen, hydroxy or NR 2, and R represents hydrogen or an alkyl group of 1 7 carbon atoms. The preferred compounds are N,N dimethylacrylamide and the corresponding methacrylamide.Other compounds that may be used are those in which the RX 2 groups are diethyl, dipropyl, dibutyl, diamyl, diheptyl, diethylol, dipropylol, diamylol, di beta chlorethyl , di beta iodoethyl , di gammabromobutyl , di beta fluoroethyl , di CH2CH2N CH3 2 , di CH2CH2CH2NHCH3 2 di CH2CH2CH2CH2NH2 , di CH2CH CH3 CH2NHC3H7 2, di CH CH3 CH2CH CH3 N CH3 2 2 etc. Suitable initiators for preparing the terpolymers comprise K2S2081 Na2S 2081 NH4 2S208, ditertiarybutyl peroxide, diisopropyl benzene hydroperoxide, dibenzoyl peroxide, etc. Reducing activators that may be used include conventional alkali metal pyrosulfites, alkyl mercaptans, alkali metal formaldehyde sulfoxylates, alkali metal sulfites, alkali metal bisulfites, etc. Since the polymerization is generally not taken to complete conversion and since the butadiene has a greater tendency for polymerization under the conditions used, the percent of butadiene is generally somewhat higher in the polymer molecules than in the monomer mixture and the other monomers are slightly lower in percent in the polymer than in the starting mixture.Consequently in order to obtain the desired proportions in the polymer it is advisable to take this fact in consideration in determining the proportions of monomers to use.Therefore it is generally desirable to have about 2 5 percent more of the styrene and 3 10 more of the acrylamide or methacrylamide in the monomer mixture than is aimed for in the polymer molecules. Accordingly the monomer mixtures generally contain 55 82 percent, preferably 60 75 percent butadiene, 12 35 percent, preferably 17 30 percent styrene and 5 30 percent, preferably 10 25 percent of the acrylamide or methacrylamide. The polymerization mixture generally has an emulsifying agent such as sodium lauryl sulfate. Other satisfactory emulsifying agents are well known in the emulsion polymerization art. Generally at least 50 percent of the polymerization mass comprises the water which is the supporting medium for the emulsified particles of monomer and ultimately of polymer product.The remainder of the reaction mass comprises the monomeric mixture which may be as much as 50 percent by weight but generally no more than about 35 percent of the mass. Also present are an initiator and possibly an activator or reducing agent for the initiator, and possibly one or more modifiers that may be desired to alter favorably the properties of the polymer product. The polymerization is generally conducted at a temperature no lower than 0 C since the polymerization rate is very slow at such temperatures. Generally however, a polymerization temperature of 0 35 C is advantageous, preferably 5 250C. The molecular weight of the terpolymer is generally in the range of 20,000 to 250,000, preferably 50,000 to 150,000 as measured by osmometry mn . In order to promote polymerization it is generally desirable to have a free radical generating initiator such as one of the peroxy compounds listed above, advantageously in a proportion of 0.1 5 percent, preferably 0.5 2 percent based on the weight of monomeric material. It is also desirable in most cases, also to have an activator present such as an amine or an iron salt to trigger or activate the peroxy compound into generation of free radicals and thereby initiate polymerization. Such activators are advantageously present in a proportion of about 0.01 5, preferably 01 2 percent based on the weight of monomer.Mercaptans may also be used as molecular control agents, acting as transfer agents to control the molecular weight. SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION The invention is illustrated by the following examples which are intended merely for purpose of illustration and are not to be regarded as limiting the scope of the invention or the manner in which it may be practiced. Unless specifically indicated otherwise, parts and percentages are given by weight. The various polymerizations described below are performed in 10 ounce bottles capped with a rubber septum through which various additions can be made by hypodermic needle after the cap is affixed to the bottle. The bottles are cleaned and dried before use. Inhibitor is removed from the acrylamide by distilling it prior to use. With the N,N dimethylacrylamide, distillation is at 55 C and 10mum Hg. EXAMPLE I A 10 oz. bottle is charged with 100 gms. of distilled water and 2.5 gms. of emulsifier sodium lauryl sulfate . The water soluble initiator 0.3 gms. diisopropyl benzene hydroperoxide is charged together with 0.1 gm. of n dodecyl mercaptan. Styrene 14.0 gms. and 14.0 gms. of N,N dimethylacrylamide are charged and the bottle is capped. Air is purged by a stream of nitrogen introduced by a hollow needle projected through the septum into the bottom of the liquid and air removed with a stream of nitrogen passing out through another hollow needle in the septum. Then 36.0 gms. of butadiene is added through a hollow needle inserted into the rubber septum. Just before the bottle is placed on a rocker in a 50C bath, 0.25 gm. of tetraethylenepentamine is inserted by means of a hypodermic needle.The bottle is agitated and maintained at 50C for 16 hrs. Mizen unreacted butadiene is removed and the polymer product is recovered by dumping the reaction mass into isopropanol. The coagulated product is recovered and dried overnight at 40 C in a vacuum oven. Polymerization is terminated when conversion is about 55 and the product coagulated and recovered by dumping the reaction mass into isopropanol. Analysis of the polymer product shows 22. percent styrene, 73.9 percent butadiene and 3.96 percent N,N dimethylacrylamide. Measurement for green strength in a standard tire formulation shows 68 psi initial, 74 psi at peak and 10 at break. The percent elongation is 580 percent. The percent N,N dimethylacrylamide is calculated by first determining the nitrogen content and then calculating on the basis of one repeating unit bf the N,N dimethylacrylamide per atom of N. EXAMPLE II The procedure of Example I is repeated a number of times varying the amount of DMA. The amounts of DMA and the nitrogen and DMA contents are shown below in TableI.
