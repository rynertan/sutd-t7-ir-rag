## Abstract
A cylinder 15 is reciprocable in the housing 11 of a hydraulic percussive tool and a piston hammer 16 is reciprocable in the cylinder. The force between the cylinder and the housing is constant during the cycle of reciprocation and as a result the housing 11 is practically not vibrating at all. The piston hammer 16 and the cylinder 15 are coupled together to move conjointly during a part of each forward stroke of the hammer piston, which ensures the timing of the reciprocation of the hammer piston 16 and the cylinder 15 .
