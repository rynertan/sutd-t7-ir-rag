# System for the production of yarn by covering a core with fibres.

## Abstract
We refer to the figures 1 up to 4 of the enclosed drawings. A core of synthetic or other composition taken from bobbin 16 is directed to the fixed grooved ring α and is then passed through the core inlet opening 2 on the fibres guiding device 3. Further it goes out through the outlet γ and it is directed to pass through the clearance between the two rollers, which rotate in the same direction, 4, 6. Through the clearance between the two spinning equalizing discs 7 it is guided towards the yarn delivery mechanism, via the exit opening 12 of the machine. The produced stationary waves, the suction in the roller 4 and the difference in the speeds of rollers 4, 6 have a beneficial effect which leads in good quality yarn.

## Description
Sty term for the production of yarn by covering a core with fibresThe invention concerns a method for producing yarn by covering a core, consisting of manmade material e.g. polyester 32 1, 124 DEN or of other composition, with fibres e.g. of cotton or other origin .Aiming at an important increase of the delivery speed, and thence of the production, as well as at improving the quality and simplifying, as much as possible, of the mechanical part, from composition viewpoint and with a view to reduce wear due to friction and also save energy, in other words for improving the special coefficient of energy consumption, we have developed a new method for producing the above yarn, in which the core, of synthetic or other composition, is taken from a non revolving bobbin and is directed to a fixed grooved ring, placed at a suitable distance from the entry opening of the fibres guiding mechanism, to make possible the creation on the core of stationary waves, which secure the uniform stretching of the core and contribute to the spinning.From the known up to now similar systems of producing yarn by covering a core with fibres are the following three manufacturers 1. TEXTILMASCHINEN FABRIK DR. ERNST FEHRER AG Systems DREF 2 3 mentioned in Meliand Textilbericht 8 1979 2. LEESONA Hollow Spindle System 3. AECT Nova Core System RS 200The stationary waves are created by the revolution to the same direction of two rollers. Towarrts the clearance existing between them are directed both the core and fibres, the latter being taken from a usual fiber feeder, provided with a proper fibres guiding device having an almost trapezoid exit opening and bearing at a suitable position the core entry hole.During the revolution of the rollers we manage to give to the compact one of them a circumferential speed higher than that of the perforated, in order to obtain a better compression of the fibres. In this case the core is twisted and its twists, transmitted backwards, form within the space between the fixed grooved ring and the entry opening of the fibres guiding mechanism, as well as between the said entry and the exit opening, that is within the fibres guide, waves resulting to a smooth stretching of the core and to a contribution to the spinning.Inside the fibres guiding device a small quantity of fibres is twisted along with the core and thus a first covering of the core is taking place. Then the total spinning is accomplished at a place in which the core along with the fibres is diving in the clearance between the two rollers description of which will follow with the help of a stream of air coming from outside, which stream is generated by lowering of pressure, as it will described in detail below. With a view to equilibrate the spinning, two spinning equalizing discs are placed, one on of the axles of the aforesaid rollers, in the broken clearance between these discs a friction is produced upon the surface of the yarn issued, in such a way as to make the spinning, that is the even covering of the core.After it leaves the spinning equalizing discs, the ready yarn is going out through the exit opening of the machine casing and is guided to the winding device with the help of a pair of delivery rollers.Of the aforesaid two rollers, revolving to the same direction, the one is concave and perforated on its cylindrical surface, while the other is compact and bears on its cylindrical surface a lining applied by means of an adhesive material. Within the concave perforated roller and on the same axis is fitted a fixed air sucking drum, bearing a slot lengthwise, at position being at the height of the clearance between the above two rollers.Through the slot in question the air is sucked from the space outside the machine and, in that way, we have an inflow of air from the feeder as well as from the fibers guiding device, resulting on the one hand to the blasting of fibers to the area of the rollers and on the other hand to the inflow through the hole on the machine casing, of a stream of air from outside, which forces both the core and fibres to the driven whithin the spinning place, as described above.In has to the pointed out that, through the small holes of the perforated roller takes place the removal of dust, as well as 6f extremely short fibres which are useless thus avoiding pollution of the environment. Besides, the system of yarn production, according to the invention operatcs continuously, since the feeding of core and fibres takes place while the system is operating. The same also applies for the delivery of the ready yarn.The invention is explained in detail on the basis of the attached two sheets of drawings, which showFig. 1 A schematic arrangement of the principle of functioning of the yarn production system, according to the invention.Fig. 2 A top view of the yarn production system, according to the invention.Fig. 3 A cross section of the yarn production system, according to the invention, along the line A A of fig. 2.Fig. 4 A cross section of the yarn producing system, according to the invention, along the line B B of fig. 2.As shown in Fig. 1 a core of synthetic or other composition which is taken from the bobbin 16, is directed to the fixed grooved ring a and then is passed through the core inlet opening 2 on the fibers guiding device 3. Further it goes out through the outlet Y, and it is directed to pass through the clearance between the two rollers 4, 6. Through the clearance between the two spinning equalizing discs 7 it is guided towards the yarn delivery mechanism, via the exit opening 12 of the machine.Then the two rollers 4, 6 are given a rotative movement, both to the same direction, and the suction device, which is not shown on the drawincjs, is put into operation. Through the duct 8 of te suction drum 5, the suction slot 9 of said drum and the holes of the perforated concave roller, the outside air is sucked from the hole 10 and from the fibers feeder 1, since the system is air tightly closed.Fibres are taken from the fiber feeder 1, enterthrough the fibres guide 3 in the clearance between the rollers 4, 6 after having been partly twisted along with the core, at place 6, where with the help of the rollers 4, 6 rotating both to the same direction, stationary waves 15 are created in the spaces a ss and B y on the core, generated by own twists which are transmitted behind and thus the spinning is accomplished. The covered core slips through the clearance between the two rollers 4, 6 drawn by the receiving mechanism and through the rotating spinning equalizing discs 7 is directed to the receiving system.The fig. 2, is a top view of the yarn production system, according to the invention, on which is shown in semi section the arrangement of the two rollers 4, 6 along with the spinning equalizing discs 7.In fig. 3, which is a cross section of the production system according to the invention, is shown along the line A A of fig. 2 the longitudinal slot 9 of the suction drum 5 and the transparent cover 11 with outside air inflow hole 10. Finally, in fig. 4, is shown the cross section form of the exit opening 3 of the fibres and core, the outside coating 14 of the compact roller 6, as well as the place of the slot 9 of the suction drum 5. To cope with the air whirlings created by the high rotation speed of the rollers 4, 6, a whirling amortizing plate 13 is provided.As an example of the product processed is core spun yarn Ne 14 single ply made by a core of polyester 32 1, 124 DEN. with staple fibers of cotton having a length which varies from 10 mms up to 30 mms.We can state that the above invention can be applied in textile industries for producing core spun yarn.
