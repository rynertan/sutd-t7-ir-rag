# Magnetic head core and method for producing the same.

## Abstract
A magnetic head core 50 consisting of plural core elements 26,40 of ferrite which are butted and bonded together into a generally ring shaped structure by means of solid solid reaction at the abutting surfaces. A magnetic gap 46 is defined by opposed surfaces of the two core elements, at one end of the core. In producing the core from a pair of core elements, at least one 26 of the core elements is subjected to grinding or chemical etching at 30 to remove stock to form the magnetic gap when the elements are assembled, and a groove 28 is formed in at least one of the core elements. The two core elements 26, 40 are then butted together with the groovelocated internally to form a coil winding aperture between the two elements, and so that the opposed surfaces of the elements define the magnetic gap. The butted core elements are then heated to bond them at the abutting surfaces by means of solid solid reaction.
