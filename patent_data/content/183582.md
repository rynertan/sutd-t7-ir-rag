# Clock buffer circuit with non saturated pull up transistor to avoid hot electron effects.

## Abstract
A clock buffer circuit for multiple phase complementary clocking signals that receives a plurality of corresponding enabling signals ENPH0 ENPH3 and generates a like plurality of clock signals PH0 PH3 in response thereto. Each clocking signal PH0 is generated by a buffer module 17A including a resistor 61A , a pull up transistor 60A and a pull down transistor 55A , which are connected in series between a positive power supply and ground, with the clocking signal being taken from the node between the pull up and pull down transistors. In each module, before the clocking signal shifts from a low state to a high, the pull down transistor is on so that the clocking signal is at a low state. The pull up transistor in each module is controlled by the corresponding enabling signal EPH0D and is enabled to begin conducting at the time that the clocking signal is to shift to a high state. The resistor keeps the pull up transistor in its linear, non saturated operating regions, which results in an increase in the intrinsic capacitance in the pull up transistor from the saturated condition. After the pull up transistor is turned on, allowing the intrinsic capacitance of the pull up transistor to charge, the pull down transistor is then turned off and the gate of the pull up transistor is isolated. The voltage levels at the gate and source terminals of the pull up transistor rise in a bootstrapping operation. When the clock signal is to shift to a low state, the complementary phase clocking signal PH1 turns on the pull down transistor.
