# A disk cartridge having a flexible disk storage medium and a disk file including such a cartridge.

## Abstract
A disk cartriage file employs a cartridge 1 which is a rigid enclosure containing a flexible information storage disk 2 mounted on a drive hub 3 . One wall 11 of the cartridge comprises a central hub drive aperture 13 and an arcuate radially extending access slot 15 for a read write transduc er. In operation, the disk flies over the inner surface of the apertured wall or an air bearing. This surface is planar over a major portion including the access slot 15 but has a smoothly contoured raised land 29 bordering the slot on the downstream side thereof. When employed in combina tion with a transducer 47 of the ring stabilised type which projects through the slot 15 and penetrates into the normal path of the medium, the transducer is coupled with the medium in a stable closely spaced air bearing relationship. The raised land 29 extends the range of penetration over which the transducer is coupled, particularly at the outer diameter of the disk.
