## Description
The present invention relates to a method for producing a polyolefin comprising polymerizing an α olefin in the presence of a catalyst composition comprising A a solid catalyst component prepared by contacting a a solid component comprising a magnesium alkoxide and or a magnesium salt of a fatty acid supported on an inorganic oxide composed of at least one member selected from the group consisting of oxides of elements belonging to Groups II, III and IV of the periodic table and or a composite inorganic oxide containing at least one member selected from the group consisting of oxides of elements belonging to Groups II, III and IV of the periodic table, b an electron donating compound and c a titanium halide, B an inorganic metal compound, and C an electron donating compound. It is known to produce a polyolefin using a Ziegler Natta catalyst comprising a solid catalyst component composed of a titanium component and a magnesium halide carrier, and an organic aluminum compound component as described in JP A 39991 78 and JP A 206415 84. This conventional catalyst has a relative high activity. However, there is a problem that when the polyolefin produced by the above described conventional method is molded using a molding machine, magnesium halide which remains in the polyolefin produced promotes corrosion of the molding machine and leads to production of molded articles having a poor appearance. On the other hand, a method for producing a polyolefin has been proposed which uses a solid catalyst component prepared by supporting a magnesium dialkoxide on a carrier of an inorganic oxide such as SiO₂ not containing a halogen and reacting the thus prepared solid catalyst component with an electron donating compound such as a carboxylic acid monoester and a titanium halide compound, as described in JP A 162607 83. However, this method is disadvantageous in that the catalyst used has a low catalytic activity and the deposition of the magnesium alkoxide on the carrier is in sufficient, resulting in that the polyolefin obtained is a powder of poor particle size distribution and has an insufficient stereoregularity, and that depending on the kind of the α olefin used the molecular weight distribution of the resulting polyolefin in is broad and films molded therefrom have a poor transparency. Further, a method for producing a polyolefin using a solid catalyst composed of a titanium halide and a carrier which is prepared by reacting an organic silicon compound with silica, for example, and further reacting the product with a magnesium compound such as a magnesium alkyl halide compound RMgX and with an alcohol, sequentially, as described in Japanese Patent Publication No. 6962 85. This conventional method, however, is disadvantageous in that polymers having a high stereoregularity are not obtained. On the other hand, it is known to produce a polypropylene, one of polyolefins, using a multi stage polymerization method in order to improve the impact strength of the polypropylene. For example, there is known a two stage slurry polymerization method as described in , e.g., Japanese Patent Publication No. 11448 83. The polypropylene produced by this method has an impact strength which is improved to some extent but is insufficiently satisfactory. A three stage slurry polymerization method is also proposed as described in Japanese Patent Publication No. 145114 82, which method fails to produce polypropylenes that have a satisfactorily improved impact strength. In addition, a two stage gas phase polymerization method using a titanium trichloride catalyst is proposed as described in, e.g., JP A 187413. Although this method is somewhat improved since it does not require a step of recovering the solvent used and thus a step of drying the resulting polymer is widely simplified, it still needs to remove catalyst residue because the catalyst used has a low catalytic activity. In order to cope with this problem, development of a gas phase polymerization method using a catalyst having a high catalytic activity is under way but there are many problems to be solved before such method can be utilized in practice and a complete solution therefore has not been proposed yet as far as is known. Among polyolefins, there is included propylene ethylene random copolymers, which are used widely in various fields of film technology. The propylene ethylene random copolymers are produced by copolymerizing propylene and ethylene monomers using a stereoregular polymerization catalyst comprising a solid catalyst component composed of a titanium compound supported on a magnesium halide carrier, and an organic aluminum compound. However, such propylene ethylene random copolymers are disadvantageous in that they have poor heat sealing properties at low temperatures. Ziegler catalysts are described in Kunststoff Handbuch, vol. IV, Polyolefine , Carl Hanser Verlag, München, 1969, pages 66 to 77, comprising two components having different compounds for example organo aluminum compounds or organo titanium compounds. The purification of a polymerization treated propylene from water, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, oxygen, hydrogen, etc. is described in Encyclopaedia of Polymer Science and Technology, vol. 11, John Wiley Sons, Inc. 1969 , page 598, in order to prevent deactivation of the catalyst in the polymerization system. The JP A 58 162 607 deals with a polymerization of an α olefin carried out in the presence of a catalyst consisting of a solid catalyst component resulting from reaction between a solid obtained by the reaction of at least one of oxides of metals of the groups II to IV in the periodic table with a magnesium compound in an organic solvent to precipitate the resulting component, an electron donor and tetravalent titanium compound containing one or more halogen atoms, and an organo aluminum compound and an organic acid ester. In order to improve the heat sealing properties of the propylene ethylene random copolymers, it has conventionally been proposed to increase the content of ethylene as a monomer unit. When a slurry polymerization method is employed in order to increase the content of ethylene, not only the amount of soluble polymers which are by produced increases and as a result the yield of the propylene ethylene random copolymer desired decreases but also the properties of the slurry during the polymerization reaction is deteriorated and it is difficult to carry out the polymerization reaction continuously. On the other hand, an attempt to increase the content of ethylene by the use of a gas phase polymerization method gives rise to a new problem in that the resulting propylene ethylene random copolymer has an increased adherent property which tends to lead to the formation of agglomerates and as a result to the occurence of accidents such as clogging of pipelines for transportation. Further, the various polyolefins produced by the above described polymerization methods, which are usually transported in a pipeline to a predetermined place in the form of dry powders, tend to cause accidents due to clogging of pipelines for transportation since the polyolefins produced by the conventional methods have unsatisfactory particle size distribution. An object of the present invention is to provide a method for producing a polyolefin having a good particle size distribution which can be passed through a pipeline for transportation without causing clogging thereof. Another object of the present invention is to provide a method for producing a polyolefin which contains much less catalyst residue and is prevented from corroding molding machines, and in addition which can be molded into articles having a good appearance. Still another object of the present invention is to provide a method for producing a polyolefin which has a high stereoregularity and can be molded into highly transparent films. Further, an object of the present invention is to provide a method for producing a polyolefin which can be molded into articles having an improved mechanical strength. A still further object of the present invention is to provide a method for producing a polyolefin, particularly a propylene copolymer, which can be molded into articles having improved heat sealing properties at low temperatures. Another object of the present invention is to provide a method for producing a polyolefin, particularly a polybuten 1, which contains catalyst residues in minimized amounts, has a high stereoregularity, has a narrow particle size distribution and contains substantially no fine powder. Still another object of the present invention is to provide a carrier for a catalyst which has a high activity and is suitable for use in the polymerization of polyolefins which contains a reduced amount of a catalyst residue, and a method for producing such a carrier. Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a carrier for a catalyst with which there can be produced a polyolefin having a good practice size distribution and which not only does not harm but also increases the catalytic activity of titanium, and a method for producing such a carrier. These objects of the present invention are attained by a method for producing a polyolefin comprising polymerizing an α olefin in the presence of a catalyst composition comprising A a solid catalyst component prepared by contacting a a solid component comprising a magnesium alkoxide and or a magnesium salt of a fatty acid supported on an inorganic oxide composed of at least one member selected from the group consisting of oxides of elements belonging to Groups II, III and IV of the periodic table and or a composite inorganic oxide containing at least one member selected from the group consisting of oxides of elements belonging to Groups II, III and IV of the period table, b an electron donating compound and c a titanium halide, B an organic metal compound, and C an electron donating compound, which is characterized in that the inorganic oxide or composite inorganic oxide has a surface hydroxide concentration of 3 µmol m² or less provided by at least one method of the following pretreatments Further, the above described objects of the present invention are attained by the use of, as a catalyst, a carrier having supported thereon a magnesium alkoxide and or a magnesium salt of a fatty acid, which is prepared by mixing an inorganic oxide composed of at least one member selected from the group consisting of oxides of elements belonging to Groups II, III and IV of the periodic table and or a composite inorganic oxide containing at least one member selected from the group consisting of oxides of elements belonging to Groups II, III and IV of the periodic table, the inorganic oxide or composite inorganic oxide having a surface hydroxyl group concentration of 3 µ mol m² or less, or the inorganic oxide and or composite inorganic oxide pretreated with a silicon halide and with an alcohol in this order or pretreated with a specified organic silane compound, the pretreated inorganic oxide or composite inorganic oxide having a surface hydroxy group concentration of 3 µmol m² or less, with a mixture containing at least one member selected from the group consisting of a hydrocarbon, an electron donating compound and an alkoxytitanium, and a magnesium alkoxide and or a magnesium salt of a fatty acid, optionally adding a depositing agent, separating a solid component from the resulting mixture, and drying the solid component. In the method for producing a polyolefin according to the present invention, it is essential to use a catalyst composition comprising A a solid catalyst component prepared by contacting a a solid component comprising a magnesium alkoxide and or a magnesium salt of a fatty acid supported on an inorganic oxide composed of at least one member selected from the group consisting of oxides of elements belonging to Groups II, III and IV of the periodic table and or a composite inorganic oxide containing at least one member selected from the group consisting of oxides of elements belonging to Groups II, III and IV of the periodic table, the inorganic oxide or composite inorganic oxide having a surface oxide or composite inorganic oxide having a surface hydroxyl group concentration of 3 µ mol m² or less, b an electron donating compound and c a titanium halide, B an organic metal compound, particularly an organic aluminium compound, and C an electron donating compound. The above described solid catalyst component A can be obtained by contacting a a specified inorganic oxide and or composite inorganic oxide containing at least one such inorganic oxide which has a surface hydroxyl group concentration of 3 µ mol m² or less hereafter sometimes referred to as an inorganic oxide component having supported thereon a magnesium alkoxide and or a magnesium salt of a fatty acid, b an electron donating compound, and c a titanium halide compound, if desired in d a solvent. The above described specified oxide includes oxides of elements belonging to Group II, III or IV of the periodic table and specific examples thereof include MgO, CaO, B₂O₃, SiO₂, SnO₂, Al₂O₃,. The composite inorganic oxide is an oxide containing at least one member selected from the group consisting of oxides of elements belonging to Group II, III or IV of the periodic table. Specific examples thereof include SiO₂ Al₂O₃, SiO₂ MgO, SiO₂ TiO₂, SiO₂ V₂O₅, SiO₂ Cr₂O₂, SiO₂ TiO₂ MgO. These inorganic oxides and composite inorganic oxides can be used singly or in combination. More particularly, two or more of the inorganic oxides can be used simultaneously. Further, two or more of the composite inorganic oxides can be used simultaneously. In addition, the inorganic oxide and the composite inorganic oxide can be used together. Since it serves as a carrier for a catalyst, the inorganic oxide component must have characteristics suitable as a carrier, and it is preferred that the inorganic oxide component have a specific surface area BET of 10 to 800 m² g, an average pore diameter of 1nm 10Å or more and an average particle size of 0.1 to 1000 µm. Among the above described inorganic oxide components, SiO₂ and Al₂O₃, which can have the above described characteristics, are preferred. Further, in the present invention, it is preferred that the above described inorganic oxide component have a surface hydroxyl group concentration of 3 µ mol m² or less, more preferably 1 to 0.005 µ mol m² since the possibility of decrease in the polymerization activity per titanium atom of the resulting catalyst composition increases when the surface hydroxyl group concentration of the inorganic oxide component exceeds 3 µmol m². In order to lower the concentration of the hydroxyl group on the surface of the inorganic oxide component to a level of 3 µ mol m² or less, at least one method of the following pretreatments is performed. In the present invention, it is preferred to carry out the first method, and one of the second, third and fourth methods in combination. As for the silicon halide, the following compounds can be used. Suitable examples of the silicon halide include silicon chlorides such as SiCl₄. Si₂Cl₆. Si₃Cl₈, Si₄Cl₁₀, SiHCl₃, CH₃SiCl₃, CH₃ ₂SiCl₂, CH₃ ₃SiCl, C₂H₅SiCl₃, C₂H₅ ₂SiCl₂, C₂H₅ ₃SiCl, silicon fluorides, bromides and iodide which are obtained by substituting the chlorine atom s in the silicon chlorides by fluorine atom s , bromine atom s or iodine atom s . Of these, the silicon chlorides are preferred, with SiCl₄, CH₃SiCl₃, CH₃ ₂SiCl₂ and CH₃ ₃SiCl being particularly preferred. The silicon halide which is contacted with the above inorganic oxide component can be used in an excessive amount with respect to the inorganic oxide component. Usually, the silicon halide is used in an amount of 1 to 100 mols, preferably 1 to 50 mols, per mol of the element belonging to Group II, III or IV of the periodic table. The temperature at which the inorganic oxide component is contacted with the silicon halide preferably is 0 to 200 C. When the contact temperature is high, e.g., as high as 300 C, heat decomposition of the silicon halide tends to occur and thus is undesirable. The inorganic oxide component and the silicon halide can be contacted as they are, or they are contacted with each other in an hydrocarbon solvent such as hexane, heptane, benzene, toluene, xylene. The period of time for which the inorganic oxide component and silicon halide are contacted usually is from 5 minutes to 24 hours. It is advantageous to carry out the contact in an atmosphere of an inert gas such as nitrogen gas. After contacting, it is preferred to wash the inorganic oxide component by decantation since washing treatment permits contact with an alcohol which follows to proceed advantageously. The above described hydrocarbon solvents can be used as a solvent for washing. Then, the inorganic oxide component contacted with the silicon halide can be further contacted with an alcohol, if desired. The organic silicon which can be used in the present invention is a compound which is represented by formula Suitable examples of the compound represented by the above formula include alkyl groups such as a methyl group, an ethyl group, a propyl group, a pentyl group, a hexyl group, a heptyl group, a phenyl group, a vinyl group. Of these, alkyl groups are preferred, with a methyl group being particularly preferred. Suitable examples of the group represented by X include halogen atoms such as F, Cl, Br, alkoxy groups such as OCH₃, OC₂H₅, OCH₃H₅, OC₄H₇, OC₆H₅, OC₆H₄CH₃, amino groups such as NH₂, NH CH₃ ₂, NH C₂H₅ , N C₂H₅ ₂, NHSi CH₃ ₃, and other groups such as CH₂ ₂Cl, CH₂ ₃Cl, CH₂ ₃NH₂, O₂CCH₃, CH₂ ₃SH. Of these, halogen atoms are preferred, with a chlorine atom being particularly preferred. The three R¹s in the above formula may be the same or different. Among the organic silicon compounds, trimethyl chlorosilane is preferred. The same conditions as in the case of the silicon halide can be used with respect to the amount of the organic silicone which is to be contacted with the inorganic oxide component, the temperature at which the inorganic oxide component and the organic silicone are contacted, use of solvents upon such contacting. When the inorganic oxide component which has been contacted with the silicon halide is further contacted with an alcohol, the titanium compound supported on the carrier is prevented from being inactivated and therefore decrease in titanium which is effective to polymerization of polyolefins. As for the alcohol, monohydric alcohols and polyhydric alcohols can be used. Suitable examples of the monohydric alcohols include saturated aliphatic alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, butanol, pentanol, unsaturated aliphatic alcohols such as allyl alcohol, crotyl alcohol, alicyclic alcohols such as cyclopentanol, cyclohexanol, aromatic alcohols such as benzyl alcohol, cinnamyl alcohol, heterocyclic alcohols such as furfuryl alcohol. Suitable examples of the polyhydric alcohols include ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, propylene glycol, glycerol. Of these, aliphatic alcohols are preferred, and more preferred are methanol, ethanol and propanol. Usually, the amount of the alcohol to be contacted with the inorganic oxide component which has been contacted with the silicon halide is 1 to 100 mols per mol of the silicon halide contacted with the inorganic oxide component. It is preferred to contact the inorganic oxide component with the alcohol in an inert gas atmosphere such as nitrogen gas. The temperature at which the inorganic oxide component and the alcohol are contacted may be in the range of between room temperature and reflux temperature. Usually the contacting is carried out at reflux temperature. The contacting time is not limited particularly, and it is preferred that the contacting is carried out under reflux for from 0.5 to 24 hours. After completion of the reaction upon the contacting, it is preferred to sufficiently wash the inorganic oxide component with the alcohol or the above described solvent for washing. After completion of the contacting of the alcohol and the inorganic oxide component, it is preferred to sufficiently separate the resulting solid component from the alcohol. If the alcohol remains in the solid component, there could occur reaction between the remaining alcohol and a magnesium salt of fatty acid or magnesium alkoxide which is added in the subsequent step, giving rise to adverse influence on the activity of the resulting catalyst. It is therefore preferred that the solid component which are separated be dried well. In the present invention, the solid component a composed of a magnesium alkoxide and or magnesium salt of a fatty acid supported on the inorganic oxide component which, if desired, has been pretreated as described above is used as a carrier for catalyst. As for the magnesium alkoxide, known magnesium alkoxides which are used as a carrier for catalysts employed in the polymerization of olefins of this kind can be used in the present invention. Of various known magnesium alkoxides, those which are represented by formula I are preferred. Suitable examples of the magnesium alkoxide represented by formula I include Mg OCH₃ ₂, Mg OC₂H₅ ₂, Mg OC₃H₇ ₂, Mg OC₄H₉ ₂, Mg OC₆H₁₃ ₂, Mg OC₈H₁₇ ₂, etc. Of these, dialkoxymagnesiums having an alkoxy group such as a lower alkyloxy group as a substituent are preferred. The magnesium of a fatty acid is supported on the above inorganic oxide component in place of the magnesium alkoxide or together therewith. Suitable examples of the magnesium salt of a fatty acid include magnesium palmitate, magnesium stearate, magnesium behenate, magnesium acrylate, magnesium adipate, magnesium acetylenedicarboxylate, magnesium acetoacetate, magnesium azelate, magnesium citrate, magnesium glyoxalate, magnesium glutarate, magnesium crotonate, magnesium succinate, magnesium isovalerate, magnesium isobutyrate, magnesium octanoate, magnesium valerate, magnesium decanoate, magnesium nonanoate, magnesium dococenoate, magnesium undecenoate, magnesium elaidinate, magnesium linolate, magnesium hexanoate, magnesium heptanoate, magnesium myristate, magnesium laurate, magnesium butyrate, magnesium oxalate, magnesium tartarate, magnesium tetrolate, magnesium hydroacrylate, magnesium pimelate, magnesium pyruvate, magnesium fumarate, magnesium propionate, magnesium maleate, magnesium malonaldehydate, magnesium malonate. Of these, magnesium salts of saturated aliphatic acids are preferred, and magnesium sterate, magnesium octanoate, magnesium decanoate and magnesium laurate are particularly preferred. Various methods can be used for supporting the magnesium alkoxide and or magnesium salt of a fatty acid on the surface of the inorganic oxide component. According to a preferred method, the inorganic oxide component which has been optionally subjected to the above described pretreatment is contacted with a mixture composed of at least one member selected from the group consisting of a hydrocarbon, an electron donating compound and an alkoxytitanium and the magnesium alkoxide and or magnesium salt of a fatty acid dissolved or dispersed in the above member. The above described mixture can be prepared in various manners as follows. Suitable examples of the hydrocarbon include alilphatic hydrocarbons such as pentane, hexane, octane, decane, dodecane, tetradecane, kerosene, ligroin, petroleum ether, alicyclic hydrocarbons such as cyclopentane, methylcyclopentane, cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane, cyclohexane, aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, xylene, ethylbenzene, cumene, cymene, halogenated hydrocarbons such as dichloroethane, dichloropropane, trichloroethylene, carbon tetrachloride, chlorobenzene. Among these, hexane, heptane, octane, are preferred. Suitable examples of the electron donating compound include aliphatic alcohols, aromatic alcohols, ethers, aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, carboxylic acid anhydrides, acid halides, amines, amides, nitriles, isocyanates. Of these, alcohols, particularly methanol, ethanol, are preferred. Preferred examples of the alkoxytitanium include tetraalkoxytitaniums such as tetramethoxytitanium, tetraethoxytitanium, tetra n butoxytitanium, tetraisopropoxytitanium. In the above described supporting method, the temperature at which the above described mixture is contacted with the inorganic oxide component is, for example, from 0 to 300 C, preferably from 0 to 200 C and more preferably from 10 to 180 C, and the contacting time is from 0.5 to 24 hours and preferably 5 to 24 hours. Upon the contacting, the above described mixture can be used in an amount of from 0.5 to 20 mmol as magnesium per gram of the inorganic oxide component. In the case of the magnesium salt of fatty acid, it can be used in an amount of from 0.5 to 20 mmol per gram of the inorganic oxide component. Alternatively, another method for supporting the magnesium alkoxide and or magnesium salt of fatty acid on the inorganic oxide component can be used in which metal magnesium and R²OH and or R³OH R² and R³, which may be the same or different, each represents an alkyl group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms, a cycloalkyl group having 5 to 10 carbon atoms, an aryl group having 6 to 10 carbon atoms or an arakyl group having 7 to 10 carbon atoms are reacted, optionally in the presence of at least one member selected from the group consisting of the above described hydrocarbon, electron donating compound and alkoxytitanium to from an alkoxymagnesium, which then is contacted with the inorganic oxide component. In order to well support the magnesium alkoxide and or magnesium salt of fatty acid on the inorganic oxide component, it is preferred to use a depositing agent regardless of whichsoever method is employed. That is, it is advantageous to add a depositing agent to a mixture composition obtained by contacting a mixture of the inorganic oxide component, which has been optionally subjected to the above described pretreatment, with a mixture composed of at least one member selected from the group consisting of hydrocarbon, an electron donating compound and an alkoxytitanium and the magnesium alkoxyde and or magnesium salt of a fatty acid dissolved of dispersed in the above member, and then separate the resulting solid component a as by decantation. Suitable examples of the depositing agent include lower alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol, pentanol. In the case where a mixture containing a magnesium alkoxide and or magnesium salt of a fatty acid using a tetraalkoxytitanium, it is preferred to use a lower alcohol which has an alkyl moiety having a carbon atom number smaller than that of the alkyl moiety contained in the tetraalkoxy titanium. The depositing agent is used in an amount sufficient for depositing a magnesium alkoxide and or magnesium salt of a fatty acid on a carrier for catalyst for use in the polymerization of olefins. For getting preferable solid component a , it is not admired to contact the inorganic oxide component containing the magnesium alkoxide and or magnesium salt of a fatty acid with the depositing agent simultaneously since the activity for polymerization of the catalyst metal supported decreases undesirably. The solid component a thus obtained, either composed of composite inorganic oxide alone or composed of a mixture of the inorganic oxide and the composite inorganic oxide, preferably contains from 0.1 to 20 by weight, more preferably from 0.5 to 10 by weight as magnesium atom of the magnesium alkoxide and or magnesium salt of a fatty acid based on the total weight of the inorganic oxide s which is are used as a carrier. As for the electron donating compound b which is a starting material for preparing the solid catalyst component A , there can be used organic compounds having an electron donating group containing an oxygen atom, a nitrogen atom or a sulfur atom.

Yet another examples of the organic silane compound include those compounds which have been converted to an organic silane compound having an Si O C bonding by reacting a silicon compound not containing an Si O C bonding with a compound containing an O C bonding previously or during the polymerization of α olefins. For example, a combination of SiCl₄ and an alcohol can be used. Specific examples of the organic silane compound containing an Si O C bonding include trimethylmethoxysilane, trimethylethoxysilane, dimethyldimethoxysilane, dimethyldiethoxysilane, diphenyl dimethoxysilane, methylphenyldimethoxysilane, diphenyldiethoxysilane, ethyltrimethoxysilane, vinyltrimethoxysilane, methyltrimethoxysilane, phenyltrimethoxysilane, γ chloropropyltrimethoxysilane, methyltriethoxysilane, ethyltriethoxysilane, vinyltriethoxysilane, butyltriethoxysilane, phenyltriethoxysilane, γ aminopropyltriethoxysilane, chlorotriethoxysilane, ethyltriisopropoxysilane, vinyltributoxysilane, ethyl silicate, butyl silicate, trimethylphenoxysilane, methyltriallyloxysilane, vinyltris β methoxy ethoxy silane, vinyltriacetoxysilane, dimethyltetraethoxy disiloxane. The above described various electron donating compounds C can be used singly or two or more of them can be used in combination. Of the electron donating compound C , preferred are esters, ethers, ketones, acid anhydrides, organic silane compounds containing an Si O C bonding. Particularly, alkyl esters of aromatic carboxylic acids, for example, an alkyl ester of an aromatic carboxylic acid such as benzoate, p methoxybenzoate, p ethoxybenzoate, toluylate, etc. having 1 to 4 carbon atoms in the alkyl moiety, phenydialkoxysilanes such as diphenyldimethoxysilane, are preferred. Also, aromatic ketones such as benzoquinone, aromatic carboxylic acid anhydrides such as bonzoic anhydride, ethers such as ethylene glycol butyl ether, are preferred. The electron donating compound C may be the same as or different from the electron donating compound b used in the preparation of the solid catalyst component A . Various components of the catalyst for the polymerization of olefins are contained in amounts set forth below. Usually, the solid catalyst component A is used in an amount of from 0.001 to 1 mmol ℓ as titanium. The organic metal compound B is contained in an atomic ratio of metal titanium of from 1 to 1000, preferably from 5 to 500. The electron donating compound C is used in an amount of electron donating compound C titanium of from 0.01 to 100 mol atom . In the method of the present invention, use of a catalyst comprising an aromatic dicarboxylic acid ester as a raw material of the solid catalyst component and an organic silane compound containing an Si O C bonding as the electron donating compound gives rise to maximized activity. In the present invention, α olefin is polymerized in the presence of the above described catalyst to produce polyolefins. As the α olefin, there can be used those represented by formula Specific examples of such α olefin include straight chain monoolefins such as ethylene, propylene, butene 1, pentene 1, octene 1, branched chain monoolefins such as 4 methylpentene 1, and vinylcyclohexene. The α olefin which is subjected to polymerization reaction can be used either singly to form a homopolymer or in combination of two or more of them to form a random or so called block copolymer. Upon copolymerization, α olefin s can be copolymerized with an unsaturated compounds such as a conjugated diene or an unconjugated diene. The polymerization reaction used in the method of the present invention can be carried out in a conventional manner under conditions commonly used in the field of polymerization of olefins. Generally, a slurry polymerization method, a bulk polymerization method, a vapor phase polymerization method, can be used. The polymerization temperature is generally 20 to 100 C, preferably 40 to 90 C, and the polymerization pressure is usually 9,81x10⁴ to 9,81x10⁶ Pa Gauge 1 to 100 Kg cm²G preferably 4,9x10⁵ to 4,9x10⁶ Pa Gauge 5 to 50 Kg cm²G . Generally, the polymerization reaction can be carried out by a solution polymerization method using as a solvent an aliphatic, alicyclic or aromatic hydrocarbon or a mixture thereof. Suitable examples of the solvent include propane, butane, pentane, hexane, heptane, cyclohexane, benzene, and mixtures thereof. Also, a vapor phase polymerization method and a bulk polymerization method in which a liquid monomer itself is used as a solvent, can be applied. The molecular weight of polyolefin produced according to the method of the present invention varies depending on the manner of polymerization reaction, catalyst system used, conditions for polymerization applied, and can be controlled, if desired, by the addition of hydrogen gas, alkyl halides, dialkylzinc. Although description has been made hereinabove relative to general polymerization reaction in the presence of a special catalyst of the present invention, the method of the present invention can be employed to produce various polyolefins having specific characteristics as set forth hereinbelow by selecting the kind of the α olefin and adopting special polymerization procedures. This method is to polymerize propylene in two stages in the presence of the above described catalyst. In the first stage of the polymerization reaction, substantially polymerization of propylene occurs, and in the second stage, polymerization of propylene and an α olefin other than propylene proceeds in the presence of the propylene homopolymer prepared in the first stage. It should be noted that both when copolymerization between propylene and an α olefin other than propylene is carried out in both the first and second stages, and when copolymerization between propylene and an α olefin other than propylene is carried out in the first stage and homopolymerization of propylene is carried out in the second stage in the presence of the propylene copolymer obtained in the first stage, no polymer that has a high, well balanced stiffness and impact strength can be obtained. This is quite surprising. Any type of polymerization method can be used. For example, a vapor phase polymerization method, a bulk polymerization method in which liquid monomer itself serves as a solvent, a slurry polymerization method, can be used. Of these, a slurry polymerization method is preferred. When the vapor phase polymerization method is employed, a step of recovering a solvent for polymerization can be eliminated and as a result a step of dying the resulting polymer can be simplified to a greater extent. If the polymerization reaction is carried out according to a slurry polymerization method, the amount of soluble polymers which are by produced can be reduced. The two stage polymerization reaction can proceed as follows. That is, first and second reactors, for example, fluidized bed reactors are connected in series. In the first reactor, gaseous or liquid propylene is supplied to a reaction system containing the above described catalyst while stirring the reaction system, and if desired, a hydrocarbon which is volatile but is not polymerizable such as propane, butane, pentane, is supplied in a gaseous state to the reaction system so as to keep it in a fluidized condition, and the polymerization in the first stage is carried out by heating to a predetermined temperature under a predetermined polymerization pressure. In the second reactor, propylene and an α olefin other than propylene are supplied to the reaction product transported directly from the first reactor or the reaction product transported from the first reactor and passed through a deaeration apparatus provided between the first and second reactors so as to remove unused propylene and the like gaseous components, and the second stage polymerization reaction is carried out at a predetermined polymerization temperature and at a predetermined polymerization pressure while keeping the reaction system in a fluidized condition. If desired, a prepolymerization can be carried out in which a small amount propylene is polymerized prior to the polymerization reaction in the first stage. As for the α olefin other than propylene, there can be used straight chain monoolefins such as ethylene, butene 1, hexene 1, octene 1, branches chain monoolefins such as 4 methylpentene 1, and dienes such as butadiene. In order to obtain polymers having preferable properties, it is advantageous to use ethylene as the α olefin other than propylene. The catalyst can be supplied in the form of a suspension in an inert solvent or an α olefin. Hydrogen gas which is used for controlling the molecular weight of the product can be supplied to the reactor at a desired position. In the vapor polymerization method, the amount of a gas to be supplied is preferably maintained such that the flow rate of the gas is maintained in a range appropriate for facilitating fluidization of the reaction bed, decreasing the load of mechanical agitation and preventing the occurrence of entrainment. Assuming that the minimum fluidizing speed is Umf, it is preferred that the flow rate of the gas be from 0.1 to 10 times as large as Umf, preferably from 0.2 to 3 times as large as Umf. The polymerization temperature is usually from 50 to 90 C, preferably from 60 to 85 C, for the first stage polymerization, and it is usually 80 C or less, preferrably from 30 to 70 C for the second stage polymerization. The polymerization pressure in each of the first and second stage polymerization reactions varies depending on the kind of the reactor, capability of removing the reaction heat, type of the polymerization reaction, but usually is from 9.81 10⁴ to 4.9 10⁶ Pa Gauge 1 to 50 Kg cm²G . In the first stage polymerization reaction, substantially propylene is polymerized to produce a propylene homopolymer. In this case, the amount of the propylene homopolymer produced is from 55 to 95 by weight, preferably from 65 to 90 by weight, based on the total weight of the polymer obtained after the second stage polymerization reaction. This amount can be adjusted to a desired level by controlling the second stage polymerization reaction. It is preferred that the propylene homopolymer obtained have an intrinsic viscosity number η of from 1.0 to 3.0 dl g, preferably from 1.2 to 2.5 dl g 135 C, tetralin solution . When the propylene homopolymer has an intrinsic viscosity number of below 1.0 dl g, the polymer as a final product has an increased viscosity and it is sometimes difficult to carry out the polymerization reaction continuously, and in addition the impact of the product tends to decrease. On the other hand, when the propylene homopolymer has an intrinsic viscosity number of above 3.0 dl g, the polymer finally obtained sometimes has a decreased stiffness. The propylene homopolymer having an intrinsic viscosity number within the above described range can be prepared by controlling the concentration of hydrogen gas in the reactor used in the first stage polymerization reaction. Further, the propylene homopolymer prepared by the first stage polymerization reaction preferably has an isotactic index for short I.I. , indicating ratio of boiling n heptane insoluble component of 90 by weight or more, and more preferably 95 by weight or more. When I.I. is below 90 by weight the propylene polymer finally obtained tends to have a decreased stiffness. The propylene homopolymer having I.I. within the above described range can be prepared by controlling the molar ratio of the organic aluminium compound b to the electron donating compound c . The polymer obtained in the first stage polymerization reaction may contain an α olefin other than propylene in an amount of 1 mol or less. In the second stage, it is presumed that mainly copolymerization reaction between propylene and an α olefin other than propylene proceeds in the presence of the propylene homopolymer prepared in the first stage, and as a result a copolymer of propylene and an α olefin other than propylene is formed. However, there is also a possibility that there occur various other reactions such as a reaction in which the molecular chain of the propylene homopolymer prepared in the first stage is extended, a reaction in which other α olefin is polymerized to form a homopolymer, a reaction in which a propylene homopolymer is freshly prepared. If such side reactions could occur, the polymer obtained by the two stage polymerization reaction contain a propylene homopolymer and a homopolymer of an α olefin other than propylene in admixture. If so, it is presumed that the side reactions would occur in a very low chance. If side reactions could occur in the second stage, it is presumed that after all when the second stage polymerization reaction is over, a mixture of a copolymer propylene and and α olefin other than propylene and a propylene homopolymer is obtained. In the second stage polymerization reaction, the copolymer which contains as a monomer unit an α olefin other than propylene in an amount of from 20 to 80 by weight, preferably from 30 to 70 by weight, is prepared such that the copolymer occupies from 45 to 5 by weight, preferably from 35 to 10 by weight, based on the total weight of the mixture of the polymers. When the content of the α olefin other than propylene as a monomer unit in the mixture obtained is 20 by weight, articles molded from the mixture produced by this method have a decreased impact strength, and when that content is above 80 by weight, the stiffness of the molded articles is reduced. On the other hand, when the amount of the copolymer prepared is above 45 by weight, the stiffness of articles molded from the polymer mixture finally obtained is decreased, while when that amount is below 5 by weight the impact strength of the molded articles is lowered. The polymer mixture obtained preferably has an intrinsic viscosity number η of 2.0 dl g or more, and more preferably from 2.8 to 15 dl g. When its intrinsic viscosity number is below 2.0 dl g, articles molded from the polymer finally obtained tend to have a reduced impact strength. The polymer mixture which has an intrinsic viscosity number falling within the above described range can be prepared by controlling the concentration of hydrogen gas in the reactor for polymerization reaction. In the vapor phase polymerization method, nitrogen gas can be passed to polymer powders taken out from the polymerization reactor, as a post treatment after the second stage polymerization reaction, in order to strip out olefins contained in the powders. If desired, the polymer powders can be pelletized using an extruder. In this case, a small amount of water, alcohol, can be added in order to inactivate the catalyst completely. In the slurry polymerization method, after the polymerization reaction in the second stage, the polymer taken out from the polymerization reactor can be completely removed solvents and unused monomers, dried and pelletized. The polymer mixture obtained by the two stage polymerization method as stated above can be molded into articles having excellent, well balanced stiffness and impact strength in contrast to a polymer blend obtained by simply blending from 55 to 95 by weight of a propylene homopolymer and from 45 to 5 by weight of a propylene copolymer separately prepared. Since it has an excellent particle size distribution and flow behavior, the propylene polymer produced by the two stage polymerization method can be transported in the form of powder advantageously. Therefore, the propylene polymer produced according to the method of the present invention not only are suitable as a material for producing exterior and interior automotive trims, domestic electric appliances, but also are convenient for transportation. This method is to produce a propylene random copolymer containing an α olefin other than propylene as a monomer unit in an amount of from 0.5 to 20 by weight by copolymerizing propylene with the α olefin in the presence of the above described catalyst. In order to obtain a propylene random copolymer having desired properties, it is preferred to use ethylene and butene 1 as the α olefin other than propylene. In this method, the amount of propylene or of the α olefin other than propylene is controlled such that the α olefin other than propylene as a monomer unit is contained in the propylene random copolymer finally obtained in an amount of from 0.5 to 20 by weight. When the content of the α olefin other than propylene is below 0.5 by weight, films or sheets formed from the propylene random copolymer sometimes have a poor transparency and heat setting properties. On the other hand, when the content of the other olefin is above 20 by weight, the propylene random copolymer tends to have a poor flow behavior. In the range of the content of the α olefin other than propylene, a preferred range of that content varies depending upon the kind of the α olefin. For example, in the case of propylene random copolymer from propylene and ethylene, the content of ethylene as a monomer unit is preferably from 0.5 to 8 by weight, more preferably from 2 to 6 by weight. For the propylene random copolymer from propylene, ethylene and butene 1, the content of ethylene as a monomer unit is preferably from 0.5 to 5 by weight, more preferably from 1 to 4 by weight, while the content of butene 1 as a monomer unit is preferably from 1 to 10 by weight, more preferably from 1.5 to 8 by weight. For the propylene random copolymer from propylene and butene 1, the content of butene 1 as a monomer unit is preferably from 1 to 20 by weight, more preferably from 3 to 15 by weight. The same type of polymerization reactions as for the propylene two stage polymeization method described in 2 1 above can be used for producing a propylene random copolymer. The procedures of this polymerization proceeds, for example as follows. That is, propylene and an α olefin other than propylene are supplied to the reaction system and a polymerization reaction is carried out at a predetermined polymerization temperature and at a predetermined polymerization pressure while keeping the reaction system in a fluidized condition. If desired, a prepolymerization can be carried out in which a small amount of propylene is polymerized prior to the polymerization reaction, or polymerization reaction can be carried out after polypropylene powders obtained by the prepolymerization are added to the reaction system. The catalyst components can be supplied in the form of a suspension in an inert solvent or an α olefin. Hydrogen gas which is used for controlling the molecular weight of the product to the reactor at a desired positon. In the vapor polymerization method, the amount of a gas to be supplied is preferably maintained such that the flowrate of the gas is maintained in a range appropriate for facilitating fluidization of the reaction bed, decreasing the load of mechanical agitation and preventing the occurrence of entrainment. Assuming that the minimum fluidizing speed is represented by Umf, it is preferred that the flow rate of the gas be from 0.1 to 10 times as large as Umf, preferably from 0.2 to 3 times as large as Umf. The polymerization temperature is usually 80 C or less, preferably from 30 to 70 C. The polymerization pressure varies depending on the kind of the catalyst used, retention time thereof, characteristics of the reactor, capability of removing the reaction heat, type of the polymerization reaction, but usually is from 9.81 10⁴ to 4.9 10⁶ Pa Gauge 1 to 50 kg cm²G . The propylene random copolymer thus obtained generally has an intrinsic viscosity number η of 1.0 dl g or more, and it is preferred that the copolymer has an intrinsic viscosity number of from 1.2 to 3 dl g when it is for forming films. The propylene random copolymer having an intrinsic viscosity number falling within the above described range can be prepared by controlling the concentration of hydrigen gas in the polymerization reactor. Substantially the same post treatments as in the propylene two stage polymerization method in 2 1 above can be used. The propylene polymer obtained by the method of the present invention in most cases is a random copolymer of propylene and an α olefin other than propylene and has excellent powder flowability and particle size distribution. The propylene random copolymer has an improved low temperature heat sealing property and can be transported in the form of powder advantageously. Therefore, the propylene random copolymer obtained by this polymerization method is suitable as a material for producing molded articles such as film, sheets. This polymerization method is to polymerize butene 1 alone or butene 1 and an α olefin other than butene 1 in the presence of the above described catalyst to produce a butene 1 homopolymer or butene 1 copolymer. When production of butene 1 homopolymer is intended, butene 1 alone is supplied to a polymerization reactor and polymerization reaction is carried out in a conventional manner. On the other hand, when it is intended to produce butene 1 random copolymer, butene 1 and an other olefin are supplied to a reaction reactor such that the content of butene 1 as a monomer unit in the copolymer is from 60 to 99.5 by weight, preferably from 70 to 98 by weight, and then polymerization reaction is carried out. In this case, similar polymerization procedures to those in the propylene two stage polymerization method in 2 1 above can be used. That is, there can be used a first stage polymerization treatment in which an α olefin other than butene 1 is homopolymerized and a second polymerization treatment in which a copolymerization of butene 1 or butene 1 and an other olefin in the presence of the homopolymer prepared in the first stage. Suitable examples of the other olefin which can be used include straight chain monoolefins such as propylene, ethylene, hexene 1, octene 1, branched chain monoolefins such as 4 methylpentene 1, dienes such as butadiene. In order to obtain polymers having desirable properties, it is advantageous to use propylene as the α olefin other than butene 1. The same type of polymerization reactions as for the propylene two stage polymerization method described in 2 1 above can be used for producing a butene 1 polymer. The polymerization procedures are substantially the same as those used in the propylene two stage polymerization method described in 2 1 above. In this case, the amount of the homopolymer of the olefin other than butene 1 such as propylene homopolymer prepared in the first stage is such that the homopolymer occupies from 0.5 to 30 by weight, preferably from 2 to 15 by weight based on the total weight of the product finally obtained in the second stage. The homopolymer preferably has an intrinsic viscosity number η of from 1.0 to 6.0 dl g, preferably from 1.2 to 5.0 dl g, 135 C, tetralin solution . When this intrinsic viscosity number is below 1.0 dl g the polymer mixture finally obtained tends to have an increased tackiness resulting in that continuous polymerization is difficult to carry out. On the other hand, when the intrinsic viscosity is above 6.0 dl g the polymer mixture finally obtained sometimes has a poor appearance. In addition, it is preferred that the homopolymer has I.I. of 90 by weight or more, and more preferably 95 by weight or more. When its I.I. is below 90 by weight the polymer mixture finally obtained has an increased tackiness and it is sometimes difficult to carry out polymerization continuously. By the second stage polymerization procedures, a butene 1 homopolymer or a copolymer of butene 1 and an other α olefin can be obtained. That is, the butene 1 homopolymer or butene 1 copolymer containing the other α olefin as a monomer unit in an amount of from 0.5 to 30 by weight, preferably from 1 to 20 by weight is prepared such that the homopolymer or the copolymer occupies from 99.5 to 70 by weight, preferably from 98 to 85 , based on the total weight of the polymer mixture finally obtained by the two stage polymerization method. When the content of the α olefin other than butene 1 such as propylene as a monomer unit is below 0.5 by weight, the polymer finally obtained by this method shows a decreased rate of crystal transformation resulting in that deformation of articles molded threfrom tends to occur. On the other hand, when that content is above 30 by weight, the stiffness and heat resistance of the molded articles are decreased. If the amount of the butene 1 homopolymer or butene 1 copolymer produced is above 99.5 by weight, the polymer mixture finally obtained has an increased tackiness and it is difficult to carry out polymerization reaction continuously, while the polymer finally obtained has a decreased heat resistance with that amount being below 70 by weight. It is preferred that the butene 1 homopolymer or butene 1 copolymer obtained has an intrinsic viscosity number η of from 1.0 to 6.0 dl g, more preferably from 1.2 to 5.0dl g. When its intrinsic viscosity number is below 1.0 dl g , the polymer finally obtained sometimes has an increased tackiness. The polymerization temperature in the vapor polymerization methed is usually from 40 to 90 C, preferably, and it is usually 80 C or less, preferably from 30 to 70 C for the second stage polymerization. In the slurry polymerization method, it is 50 C or less both for the first and second stage polymerizations. The polymerization pressure varies depending on the kind of the catalyst used, retention time thereof, characteristics of the reactor, capability of removing the reaction heat, type of the polymerization reaction, but usually is from 9,81x10⁴ to 2,9x10⁶ Pa Gauge 1 to 30 kg cm²G . The copolymer having an intrinsic viscosity number falling within the above described range can be prepared by controlling the concentration of hydrogen gas in the polymerization reactor. The catalyst components can be supplied in the form of a suspension in an inert solvent, an α olefin. Substantially the same post treatments as in the propylene two stage polymerization method in 2 1 above can be used. The butene 1 homopolymer or copolymer prepared by this polymerization method has excellent particle size distribution and flow behavior, and can be transported in the form of powder advantageously. It is further advantageous in that it has a high stereoregularity and that the amount of the catalyst residue in the resulting is minimized. Therefore, the butene 1 homopolymer or copolymer obtained by this polymerization method is suitable as a material for producing molded articles such as various types of pipes and films. The present invention has the following benefits or advantages. In the polymerization method described in 3 1 above, polymerization of an α olefin in the presence of a catalyst composed of the catalyst component A , organic aluminium compound B and organic silane compound C gives rise to, in addition to the benefits described in 3 1 above, an advantage that polyolefins, in particular polypropene, having a narrow molecular weight distribution can be obtained. The catalytic activity of titanium can be increased by the use of, as a solid component a in the catalyst to be used in the polymerization method described in 3 1 above, a carrier prepared by contacting, with a mixture containing at least one member selected from the group consisting of a hydrocarbon, an electron donating compound and an alkoxytitanium, and a magnesium alkoxide, a solid residue which is obtained by pretretment of at least one oxide selected from the group consisting of oxides of elements belonging to Groups II, III and IV of the periodic table and or a composite oxide containing at least one such oxide with a silicon halide and optionally with an alcohol in this order and removing a liquid. When as a solid component a in the catalyst to be used in the polymerization method described in 3 1 above, a carrier is used which is prepared by adding a mixture composed of at lest one member selected from the group consisting of a hydrocarbon, an electron donating compound and an alkoxytitanium, and a magnesium alkoxide to a solid residue composed of at least one oxide selected from the group consisting of oxides of elements belonging to Groups II, III and IV of the periodic table and or a composite oxide containing at least one such oxide or to a solid residue obtained by pretreating at least one oxide selected from the group consisting of oxides of elements belonging to Groups II, III and IV of the periodic table and or a composite oxide containing at least one such oxide with a silicon halide and optionally with an alcohol in this order and removing a liquid, and further adding thereto a depositing agent composed of at least one member selected from the group consisiting of alcohol and a halogenating agent, then the magnesium alkoxide can be deposited on the carrier sufficiently, thus giving rise to a carrier which has an almost uniform particle size and there occurs no agglomeration of carrier particles and which does not inhibit the activity of metal titanium supported thereon. Therefore, the catalyst using a carrier containing a magnesium alkoxide have a high activity and polyolefins obtained by polymerizing α olefins in the presence of this catalyst have good particle size characteristics. Further, when as a solid component a in the catalyst to be used in the polymerization method described in 3 1 above, a carrier is used which is prepared by pretreating at least one oxide selected from the group consisting of oxides of elements belonging to Groups II, III and IV of the periodic table and or a complete inorganic oxide containing at least one such oxide with an organic silane compound represented by formula When two stage polymerization of propylene is carried out in the presence of the catalyst having a high activity described in 3 1 above, the following benefits can be obtained. When propylene and an other α olefin are polymerized in the presence of the catalyst having a high activity described in 3 1 above to prepare a copolymer of which the content of the other α olefin as a monomer unit is from 0.5 to 20 by weight, the copolymer has in addition to the above described benefits advantages that it can be formed into various articles such as films, sheets, which have an excellent low temperature heat sealing property. When a polybutene or a copolymer of butene 1 and an other α olefin, particularly that in which the content of butene 1 as a monomer unit is from 60 to 99.5 by weight, is prepared in the presence of the catalyst having a high activity described in 3 1 above, a polyolefin which is suitable as a material for producing various molded articles such as pipes, films. The method of the present invention will be described in greater detail with reference to non limitative examples and comparative examples. In a 1ℓ glass reactor purged with argon were charged 40 g of silicon dioxide which was evacuated and calcined at 500 C a product by Fuji Davison Co., Ltd., grade 952, specific surface area 350 m² g, average particle size 54 to 65 µm and 200 mℓ of trimethylchlorosilane, and the mixture was allowed to react with stirring under reflux for 12 hours. Then, the reaction mixture was decanted three times using 200 mℓ of n heptane and dried to obtain solid component of silicon dioxide. Thus obtained solid component was subjected to determination of the concentration of a hydroxyl group by the reaction with methylmagnesium iodide and it was found that the hydroxyl group concentration was 0.3 µmol m². To the solid component 20g was added 100 mℓ of n heptane solution containing diethoxymagnesium 120 mmol and tetra n butoxytitanium 70 mmol , and the mixture was allowed to stand at room temperature for 1 hour. Thereafter, 50 mℓ of isopropanol was added portionwise, followed by stirring at 80 C for 1 hour. Decantation with 100 mℓ of n heptane was repeated 5 times and the residue was dried under reduced pressure at 80 C to obtain a white catalyst carrier. The catalyst carrier contained 3.8 by weight of magnesium atom. Thus obtained catalyst carrier 10.0 g was charged in a 0.5 ℓ glass reactor, and 50 mℓ of n heptane, 5.2 mmol of ethyl benzoate, and 60 g of titanium tetrachloride. The resulting mixture was stirred for 1 hour under reflux. Then, the supernatant was removed by decantation and the solid portion was well washed with hot n heptane to obtain a solid catalyst component, which contained 2.3 by weight of Ti. In a 1 ℓ autoclave purged with argon were charged 50 mℓ of hexane having suspended therein 0.006 mmol Ti of the solid catalyst component, 1.5 mmol of triisobutylaluminium and 0.41 mmol of methl p toluylate. After the autoclave was evacuated to remove argon, 310 g of propylene and 0.7 N2 of hydrogen were charged. The temperature was raised to reach 70 C in 5 minutes, and polymerization reaction was carried out at 70 C for 2 hours. After cooling the autoclave, propylene was purged and the content of the autoclave was taken out, followed by drying under reduced pressure to obtain 88 g of polypropylene powder. The powder had a bulk density of 0.39 g cm³, and contained fine particles which is defined as a particle size of 100 µm or less in an amount of 0.2 by weight. The powder had an excellent flowability. Further, the powder had an I.I. the content of residual polymer after extraction with boiling n heptane of 96.5 . Fluorescent X ray spectral analysis indicated that the polymer contains 12.0 ppm of chlorine. The same procedures as in Example 1 were repeated except that silicon dioxide not treated with trimethylchlorosilane hydroxyl group content 3,7 µmol m² was used instead of the trimethyl chlorosilane treated silicon dioxide. As a result, 9.9 g of polypropylene powder was obtained which had a bulk density of 0.37 g cm³ and an I.I. of 95.8 . The content of chlorine in the polymer was 111 ppm. The same procedures as in Example 1 were repeated except that n butyl benzoate was replaced by 2.0 mmol of diisobutyl phthalate and methyl p toluylate was replaced by 0.15 mmol of phenyl triethoxysilane. As a result, 165 g of polypropylene powder was obtained which had a bulk density of 0.41 g cm³ and an I.I. of 97.4 . The polymer contained 0.1 by weight of fine powders having a particle size of 100 µm or less. The content of chlorine in the polymer was 6.4 ppm. The same procedures as in Example 1 were repeated except that the silicon dioxide calcined at 500 C was replaced by a calcined silicon dioxide prepared by calcining silicon dioxide as starting material at 800 C for 5 hours so that the surface hydroxyl group concentration thereof was 1.8 µmol m². As a result, 18 g of polyproylene powder was obtained which had a bulk density of 0.39 g cm³ and an I.I. of 96.5 . The polymer contained 0.0 by weight of fine powders having a particle size of 100µm or less. The content of chlorine in the polymer was 69 ppm. In the same manner as in Example 1, a solid component was obtained which had a surface hydroxyl group concentration of 0.3 µmol m².

Thereafter, 600 g of butene 1 and hydrogen were introduced, and the second stage polymerization was carried out for 3 hours. After completion of the reaction, the content was taken out from the bottom of the autoclave, and unused butene 1 was removed to obtain white powdery copolymer of butene 1 and propylene. The propylene content in the copolymer determined by ¹³C NMR was 4.3 by weight. From the results in Examples 52 56 and Comparative Examples 25 27, it is apparent that polybutenes or copolymers prepared in the presence of the catalyst according to the present invention from butene 1 or butene 1 and other α olefin, particularly those copolymers in which the content of butene as a monomer unit is from 60 to 99.5 by weight, are polyolefins suitable for molding material for producing various molded articles such as pipes, films, sheets, etc. While the invention has been described in detail and with reference to specific embodiments thereof, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that various changes and modifications can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope thereof.
