# Oil filled electric cable installations.

## Abstract
In an oil filled electric cable installation, when the oil flows outwardly from the cable to a pressure maintaining oil tank it passes through a percolating filter 35 , preferably of an active material, to remove particulate and or dissolved impurities. A one way return passage 9 bypasses the filter so that maintenance of pressure is not impaired, and if required a high pressure bypass 10 may be used to protect the filter from unusually high pressures.
