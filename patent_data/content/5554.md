# Trouser construction.

## Abstract
A pair of anatomically fitted trousers with an improved construction of the crotch and front region consisting of the usual leg portions, the usual waistband and a novel combination crotch front panel 24 . The conventional leg portions with one, two or various seams at any desired location are closely fitted around each upper thigh and buttock, are suspended from the waistline by means of the usual waistband and are joined together at the rear by a medical seam 32 , closely following the contour line of the sagittal section of the pelvis down to a point near the anus 30 . Starting at said point 30 an oblong triangular cutout 33 is provided between said leg portions having two concavely curved long edges 25B, 26B and one convexly curved or straight short edge 27B , exposing the perineum and genitals, the public area and abdominal area above up to the waistband. Into said triangular cutout the combination crotch front panel 24 is inserted, acting like a large shallowly cupped hand held over the genitals and acting like an accordion between the leg portions in the perineal area during leg movement, having two oblong convexly curved 25A, 26A or straight edges 25C, 26C and a short concavely curved 27A or straight edge 27C , being connected along its oblong edges to the leg portions along the long edges of said triangular cutout and along its short edge to the waistband, thus connecting the two leg portions from said point near the anus up to the front portion of the waistband.
