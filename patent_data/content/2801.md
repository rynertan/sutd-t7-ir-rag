## Description
COATING, IMPREGNATING AND ADHESIVE COMPOSITIONS, THEIRPREPARATION AND USE This invention is concerned with coating, impregnating and adhesive compositions comprising amine containing polymers and a material containing two or more acryloxy or methacryloxy groups, and the preparation and use of such compositions. The amine polymer may have its reactivity with the poly meth acryloxy material subdued by including a volatile ketone or aldehyde in the composition or by prereacting such a ketone or aldehyde with the amine groups to form ketimine or aldimine groups in the polymer. U.S. Patent No. 2,759,913 discloses the polymerization of organic compounds containing at least two ethylenic double bonds having in the a position to each double bond a carbonyl group of an aldehyde, ketone, acid, ester or amide group with a compound containing at least two active hydrogen atoms such as an amino group as is present, for example, in ethylene diamine or piperazine, or a hydroxyl group as is present, for example, in ethylene glycol or Bisphenol A. U.S. Patent No. 3,845,056 discloses the production of amine acrylates by reaction of a diacrylate ester such as the diacrylate ester of diethylene glycol with an organic amine such as piperazine followed by radiation cure to give coatings. U.S. Patents Nos. 3,876,518, 3,878,077 and 4,016,059 disclose radiation curable compositions comprising urethane derivatives of acrylated epoxidized soybean or linseed oils which have been partially pre reacted with aliphatic secondary amines and the use of these compositions to produce coatings and inks. U.S. Patent No. 4,058,657 discloses curable composition comprising a liquid amine terminated polymer and a vinylidene terminated polymer. The amine is preferably heterocyclic and contains at least two primary or secondary amino groups. The vinylidene polymers may be prepared by reacting either polymer containing terminal functional groups with a compound containing oxirane and vinylidene groups or polymer containing terminal epoxy groups with meth acrylic acid. U.S. Patents Nos. 3,925,181, 4,037,018 and 4,096,105 disclose coating compositions in aqueous dispersions for producing curable films on a substrate. The compositions comprise 1 . a polymer having at least 5 by weight of pendant primary and or secondary amine groups which are protonated with acid to render the polymer water soluble and 2 at least 5 by weight of said polymer of bismaleamide, ethylene glycol di meth acrylate or N,Nmethylene bis acrylamide crosslinker. We have now found certain compositions which may provide durable coatings having excellent mechanical and resistance properties even on ambient curing. The curing may be accelerated, if desired, by heating. In accordance with the present invention compositions for coating, impregnating, and adhesive application are formed of 1 a soluble addition polymer containing a plurality of primary or secondary amine groups, or aldimine or ketimine groups, pendant from various spaced mers or polymer units in the polymer chain and or terminal to the chain, such groups being in free base form or in the form of a salt of an organic or inorganic acid, and 2 one or more polyethylenically unsaturated compounds, monomeric or polymeric in character, having at least two unsaturated ester groups of the general formula I EMI3.1 wherein R is H or CH3, with or without a monofunctional unsaturated monomer preferably having the general formulaIV hereinafter. The ester groups of formula I are herein designated acryloxy or methacryloxy groups depending on whether R is H or CH3. The term meth acryloxy is intended herein to be generic and to embrace both of the specific groups. While both groups or moieties of formula I are amenable to ambient cure, it has been found that the specific acryloxy group favors cure at lower ambient temperatures and for that reason the component 2 above is preferably a compound containing at least two acryloxy units. Component 1 above is frequently referred to hereinafter for the sake of simplicity as an amine containing polymer but it is to be understood that such passages are intended to embrace component 1 polymers containing imine groups, i.e. aldimine and ketimine groups or the salts of the amine or imine groups with acids, except where the context is clearly and completely inconsistent with such broader construction. Component 1 is an uncrosslinked linear vinyl addition polymer the term linear being construed to include branched as well as straight chain linkages , or a mixture of such polymers, which may have an average molecular weight from as low as about 600 number average Mn to several hundred thousand number average my , e.g., 300,000 or higher. For many purposes, the amine containing polymer is preferably one having a low molecular weight e.g. up to 15,000 Mn and in some cases having sufficient hydrophilic groups, e.g. NH2, NHR R being lower alkyl , OH, COOH, or depending on pH the carboxyl may be in the form of amineJ alkali metal, or ammonium salts, e.g. COONH4, to render this component water dispersible or even water soluble.On the other hand, the amine containing polymers may be of intermediate to moderately higher molecular weight, e.g. 30,000 to 300,000 number average and range in soluble nature from water soluble to organic solvent soluble. The addition polymers constituting component 1 may be made by direct vinyl addition polymerization of a monoethylenically unsaturated monomer containing an amine precursor group if suitable conditions are maintained during the polymerization. Thus, acid salts of the amine group containing monomer, such as aminoethyl meth acrylate hydrochloride, may be polymerized, or the blocked amine monomers of ketimine or aldimine types disclosed in U.S. Patents 3,03i,969 and 3,497,485 may be polymerized to produce the component 1 . Alternatively, a component 1 polymer may be made by making an addition polymer of one or more meth acrylic esters, having the molecular weight desired and subjecting the ester polymer to aminolysis amidation by means of a polyamine, especially an aliphatic polyamine, having at least two amine groups, at least two of such amine groups being primary or secondary. Primary amines in the amidation products may be converted to imine groups by reaction with ketone or aldehyde. In those embodiments wherein component 1 is of low molecular weight, e.g. 600 to 15,000, preferably 1000 to 5000, number average Mn low molecular weight polymers containing meth acrylic acid esters, or such polymers also containing polymerized units of other monoethylenically monomers, especially those selected from C2 to C20 alpha olefins, e.g. ethylene, propylene, and propylene trimer, styrene, vinyltoluene, acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, and eth acrylonitrile may first be prepared and the polymer of meth acrylate ester units may then be reacted with a polyamine, such as ethylenediamine or diethylenetriamine, to convert ester units into amino amide units. Thus, component 1 may be the aminolysis product of a lower alkyl meth acrylate polymer, e.g. having a number average Mn molecular weight of 600 to 15,000 preferably of a methyl acrylate MA copolymer in which the molar proportion of MA is from 2 to 35 and the comonomer s making up the balance of the copolymer may be composed of mers polymerized units of one or more monoethylenically unsaturated monomeric compounds having a group H2C Cs , such as methyl methacrylate, ethyl acrylate or methacrylate, a C3 C18 alkyl meth acrylate, e.g. butyl acrylate or methacrylate, hexyl acrylate or methacrylate, 2 ethylhexyl acrylate or methacrylate, styrene, vinyltoluene, ethylene or other a olefin , acrylonitrile, hydroxyethyl acrylate or methacrylate, and, in limited amounts, acrylic acid or methacrylic acid. The proportion of methyl acrylate, since it is the meth acrylate most susceptible to aminolysis may be, and is preferably, predetermined to provide sufficient ester mer units in the polymer available for aminolysis, to assure that the desired amount of amino groups are introduced by the aminolysis procedure. The other monomers may be selected on the basis of their contributions of hydrophobicity, flexibility, hardness, durability to weathering, e.g. ultraviolet light stability, resistance to water and other solvents, such as gasoline. If desired, ethyl acrylate or even a higher alkyl acrylate may be used as the aminolysis susceptible component of the starting polymer alternatively methyl methacrylate or higher methacrylate may be so used. The polyamine used for the aminolysis should contain at least two primary or secondary amine groups and the nitrogen atoms should be attached to aliphatic carbon atoms rather than aromatic carbon atoms. Representative polyamines useful for the aminolysis are ethylenediamine EDA diethylenetriamine DETA trimethylenediamine triethylenetetramine TETA pentamethylenediamine tetraethylenepentamine TEPA hexamethylenediamine menthanediamine 4,4 methylenebis cyclohexylamine bis aminomethyl cyclohexane piperazine N aminoethylpiperazine tris aminoethyl amine propylenediamine PDA dipropylenetriamine DPTA tripropylenetetramine TPTA 1,3 butylenediamine 1, 4 butylenediamine N aminoethyl ethanolamine A preferred class of polyamines in respect to availability, effectiveness and economy are those of the formulaEMI7.1 wherein RO is an alkylene group having 2 to 3 carbon atoms and n is 0, l, 2 or 3. Of this class, ethylenediamine generally provides optimum results. Thus, component 1 may consist essentially of a vinyl addition polymer, especially a copolymer, having a molecular weight up to several hundred thousand viscosity average, preferably of lower molecular weight in the range of number average molecular weight Mn from about 600 to 15,000, even up to 20,000, and containing from 2 to 95, preferably from 2 to 35, mole percent of meth acrylamide mers or units in which the amide nitrogen atom is substituted by an aliphatic hydrocarbon group carrying one or more primary or secondary amino groups, the hydrogen atoms of such amino group being available for reaction with a meth acryloxy groups of monomeric or polymeric compounds of polyfunctional character in respect to their content of meth acryloxy groups of formula I above. These amino amide units, if a polyamine of the prefered claas of polyamine reactants set out under formula II above is used, may have the general formulaEMI8.1 and in the specific instance wherein ethylenediamine is the reactant used and the ester units in the polymer that are aminolyzed are alkyl meth acrylate units, the amino amide units in the aminolyzed polymer have the specific structure of the formulaEMI8.2 wherein R is H or CH3. As part or all of the component 1 polymer, there may be used, as stated hereinabove, a vinyl addition polymer or copolymer containing aldimine or ketimine groups obtained by polymerization of the monomeric meth acryloxyalkyl ketiminesor aldimines of formulas I,II and III of U.S. Patent 3,037,969 or the meth acryloxyalkyloxyalkyl ketimines or aldimines of formula I, U.S. Patent 3,497,485, and the disclosure of these two patents is incorporated herein by reference.These imine containing polymers are in effect, polymers containing blocked primary amine groups. Hence, they provide longer pot life times since their operation depends on liberation and evaporation of the aldehyde or ketone from the imine nitrogen. Both of these patents disclose the mixing of copolymers containing 5 to 25 by weight of an aldimine or ketimine with polyepoxides to produce insoluble and infusible cross linked coatings.They do not, however, disclose or suggest the cold curing reaction of the present invention which requires that component 2 used herein contains a polyfunctional unsaturated compound having at least two meth acryloxy groups of formula I. The resulting products are quite distinct. Component 2 of the compositions of the present invention for coating, impregnating, and adhesive purposes consists essentially of one or more polyfunctional compounds of monomeric or polymeric condensation, addition, or vinyl addition types character containing two or more unsaturated meth acryloxy groups of formula I hereinabove. Of these, the specific acryloxy groups are preferred. It has been found that the primary and secondary amino groups, e.g. on amino amide units in component 1 ,or the developed from imine groups in component 1 undergo, even primary amine groups at ambient temperature, audition across the double bond of the meth acryloxy units of component 2 . The concurrent addition reaction of an amino group of each of several molecules of component 1 to meth acryloxy units of a polyfunctional component 2 compound serves to crosslink component 1 and thereby to cure the composition containing both components. By the term polyfunctional meth acrylate , it is intended herein to refer to compounds containing two or more unsaturated meth acryloxy groups. Examples of such compounds that are useful as part or all of component 2 are ethylene glycol diacrylate di ethylene glycol diacrylate propylene glycol diacrylate trimethylene glycol diacrylate neopentyl glycol diacrylate 1,3 butylene glycol diacrylate 1,4 butylene glycol diacrylate 1, 6 hexamethylene glycol diacrylate 1,10 decamethylene glycol diacrylate trimethylolpropane tr iacrylate pentaerythritol tetraacrylate, and pentaery thritol triacrylate. There may also be used more complex types of polyfunctional meth acrylates obtained by reaction of a meth acryloxy containing compound, such as meth acrylic acid, meth acrylyl halide, or a meth acrylic acid ester, with various compounds, such as hydroxy containing alkyd resins, polyester condensates, or polyether condensates. These complex acrylated products may in some instances be termed polymeric , since the meth acryloxy groups may be joined to a condensation polymer, e.g. a polyester or a polyurethane, to an addition polymer, e.g., a polyether, or to a vinyl addition polymer, e.g. a glycidyl acrylate polymer.Examples include A Urethane meth acrylates obtained by reacting isocyanate groups of a polyisocyanate, such as hexamethylene diisocyanate with a hydroxyalkyl meth acrylate, e.g. hydroxyethyl acrylate. These polyurethane poly meth acrylate monomers,are disclosed inU.S. Patent 3,297,745. B Polyether meth acrylates obtained by esterification of hydroxy terminated polyethers with acrylic or methacrylic acid as disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,380,831.

D Polyfunctional meth acrylates disclosed in U.S.Patent 3,560,237, e.g. obtained by reaction of a hydroxyalkyl meth acrylate, e.g. hydroxyethyl acrylate, with any one of a Dicarboxylic acids having from 4 to 15 carbon atoms, b Polyepoxides having terminal glycidyl groups, c Polyisocyanates having terminal reactive isocyanate groups. E Meth acrylate terminated polyesters made from , meth acrylic acid, a polyol having at least three hydroxyl groups, and a dicarboxylic acid U.S. Patent 3,567,494 . F Poly meth acrylates obtained by the reaction of meth acrylic acid with at least two epoxy groups of epoxidized drying oils, such as soybean oil, linseed oil, and the like, e.g. epoxidized corresponding drying oil fatty acid, an ester or amide thereof, or the corresponding alcohol, containing at least 2 epoxy groups. Such polyfunctional meth acrylates are disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,125,592. G Poly meth acrylates which are urethane or amine derivatives of the poly meth acrylated epoxidized drying oils, fatty acids and the like described in F and U.S. patent mentioned therein, obtained by the reaction of isocyanate s or amine s respectively with the poly meth acrylated epoxidized drying oils, fatty acids, US Palatent and the like described in 3,125,592. The urethane and amine derivatives retain some or all of the meth acrylate groups and are disclosed in U.S. patents 3,876,518 and 3,878,077. H Poly meth acrylates obtained by reaction of meth acrylic acid by addition to the epoxy groups of aromatic bisphenol based epoxy resins as disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,373,075. I Poly meth acrylates obtained by the addition of meth acrylic acid to a linear vinyl polymer having pendant glycidyl groups, e.g. polymers of glycidyl meth acrylate or of vinyl glycidyl ether or vinyl glycidyl sulfide as disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,530,100. J Polyfunctional meth acrylates derived from meth acrylic acid anhydride and polyepoxides as disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,676,398. K Polyfunctional meth acrylate urethane esters obtained from the combining of hydroxyalkyl meth acrylates, a diisocyanate, and a hydroxyl functional alkyd condensate as disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,673,140. L Meth acrylate terminated urethane polyesters obtained by reaction of a polycaprolactone diol or triol with an organic polyisocyanate, e.g. a diisocyanate, and a hydroxyalkyl meth acrylate. Such products are disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,700,643. M Urethane poly meth acrylates obtained by reaction of a hydroxyl containing ester of a polyol with meth acrylic acid and a polyisocyanate, such as those described in U.S. Patent 3,759,809. The disclose in the patents mentioned above in each of paragraphs A through M are incorporated herein by reference insofar as they disclose the poly meth acryloxy containing compounds and the processes of making them. Preferred polyfunctional unsaturated compounds of the complex type above. for use in component 2 are the acrylic acid adducts to polyepoxides in which the epoxy group is attached to adjacent carbon atoms, that is the epoxy groups is a vic epoxy group. The polyepoxide may be any epoxidized vegetable or animal oil having ten or more carbon atoms in the fatty acid component and sufficient unsaturation to provide at least two epoxy groups in the epoxidized oil. Drying oils or semi drying oils such as linseed oil or soybean oil are especially useful for epoxidation and subsequent acrylation. The polyepoxide to be acrylated may be any resin forming polyepoxide having at least two terminal groups of the formula,EMI13.1 obtainable by reacting epichlorohydrin and a polyhydroxy phenol or an aliphatic diol or polyol, e.g.Bis phenol A, glycerol, glycol, diethylene glycol, hexamethylene glycol and the like.Low molecular weight vinyl addition copolymers of glycidyl vinyl ether and of glycidyl meth acrylate may also be acrylated to form acrylated polyepoxides of component 2 . The relative proportions of components 1 and 2 may fall within a wide range depending upon the particular composition of each of the components. In general, the amount of unsaturated poly meth acrylate or poly meth acryloxy compound component 2 that is used is sufficient to react with primary or secondary amine groups of component 1 to result in crosslinking upon ambient or elevated temperature cure to whatever extent is desired or needed to obtain the balance or combination of mechanical and resistance properties. The ratios of component 2 to component 1 advantageously may fall in the range of 0.5 to 3.5 equivalents of unsaturated meth acryloxy groups in component 2 per equivalent of amine nitrogen primary and secondary total in component 1 . Preferably they are present in proportions providing 1.5 to 2 meth acrylate unsaturation equivalents of component 2 for each equivalent of reactive hydrogen containing amine in component 1 . Besides a content of primary and or secondary amine groups and in component 1 there may also be other hydrophilic group or limited groups or linkages depending on the composition of the copolymer and the polyamine used in aminolysis and the procedure used in aminolysis. Thus the initial copolymer may contain hydroxyl or carboxyl groups for optimum results, the equivalents of amine nitrogen in the copolymer should exceed the equivalents of carboxyl, if any, therein , the polyamine may contain two primary amine groups, one of which on aminolysis converts the acrylic ester linkage to an acrylic amide linkage in which the amide nitrogen carries one unsubstituted hydrogen and an amino containing substituent which may contain not only a terminal primary or secondary amino nitrogen, but also one or more intermediate secondary amino groups or even a pendant hydroxyl groups.In addition, a relatively small but significant amount of carboxyl groups may be introduced into the polymer if aminolysis is not carried out under essentially anhydrous conditions. Having some content of hydrophilic groups, as those mentioned may be desirable in the cured films and to the extent they are felt to contribute desirable properties to the cured film, their presence may be tolerated or even favored by taking deliberate steps to introduce them. Such hydrophilic groups may be particularly desirable when the coating system is to be dispersed or dissolved in aqueous media. In a modified embodiment of the invention, a portion of the reactive amine content of the component 1 polymer may be reacted with a monoethylenically unsaturated compound of formula IV hereinafter, such as a meth acrylonitrile, a meth acrylamide or a mono meth acrylate such as an alkyl meth acrylate. This may be carried out before the polyfunctional meth acrylate is mixed with the amine containing polymer constituting component 1 .Alternatively, part or all of the monofunctional unsaturated compound, such as mono meth acrylate, may be added to the polyfunctional meth acrylate of component 2 whereby such component 2 contains both a monofunctional unsaturated compound of formula IV below and polyfunctional meth acrylate which react simultaneously with the amino containing component 1 . This use of a monofunctional unsaturated compound reduces the amount of reactive amine that is available for reaction with the polyfunctional unsaturated meth acrylate of component 2 and provides for greater versatility in producing products having a variety of desired properties in the coatings systems of the present invention, e.g. pot life extension, coating gloss, hydrophobicity, coefficient of friction, surface contact angle, etc. The general class of monofunctional unsaturated compounds that may be used to reduce the amount of active hydrogen on primary or secondary amine groups of the amine containing polymer to be used as component 1 may be a compound of the general formula H2C C R X IV wherein R is H or CH3, preferably being H, and X is an electron withdrawing group, such as a group selected from CN, CON R2 R3 , and COOR4, R2 being H or C1 to C20 EMI15.1 substituted with halogen atoms, such as the specificEMI15.2 compounds a mixed C16 C20 alcohol acrylate and hexafluoroisopropyl acrylate. When a primary amine group in the polymeric component 1 takes on a single unsaturated compound of formula IV, the production of reaction product may be represented by the equation EMI15.3 When the same addition occurs with a secondary amine group on the component 1 polymer, the active hydrogen on the secondary amine nitrogen is replaced by a group CH2 CHR X and is no longer available for crosslinking by component 2 . However, the amount of monofunctional compound of formula IV should not be so great as to eliminate so many of the active hydrogen atoms on primary or secondary amine nitrogen atoms as to preclude adequate addition of component 1 polymer across the double bonds of the polyfunctional component 2 to crosslink the composition to the extent necessary to provide the desired mechanical and resistance properties in the cured products.The same range of ratios of component 2 to component 1 0.5 to 3.5 equivalents of unsaturated groups in component 2 per equivalent of amine primary and secondary total in component 1 is applicable to the situation when component 2 contains both monofunctional and polyfunctional unsaturated compounds, provided that the latter compound supplies at least 0.5, and preferably 1.5 to 2 meth acryloxy unsaturation equivalents per equivalent of amine nitrogen in component 1 . If part or all of the monofunctional unsaturated compound of formula IV is first reacted with the amine containing component 1 , the resulting reduction of reactive amine content in the component 1 polymer should be taken into consideration when subsequently determining the ratio used in reacting component 2 with component 1 . The component 2 not only serves to crosslink the composition but it may also be selected to alter the properties of the final cured product. This is especially true when one of the more complex polyfunctional meth acrylates, such as those mentioned in the paragraphs above identified by the letters A ti M is used in the composition. In addition, a monofunctional compound of formula IV may be selected with the intention to provide modified properties of the cured product. There may also be used as component 2 a mixture of two or more of the polyfunctional unsaturated meth acrylates, again for the purpose of crosslinking and also modifying the final mechanical, optical, and chemical resistance properties. Component 2 may include a vinyl addition polymerization inhibitor, such as hydroquinone, in small amounts, such as 0.01 to 0.2 . The compositions comprising the amine containing polymer or polymers making up component 1 and the polyfunctional meth acryloxy crosslinking compounds constituting component 2 have room temperature pot stability falling in the range of about 15 minutes to several days depending on the particular amine containing polymer s used for component 1 and the particular unsaturated poly meth acrylate s used therein. The imine containing polymer has considerably longer stability. Therefore it is particularly appropriate to include the stabilizing ketone or aldehyde when the component 1 contains no imine groups. The stability of both amine and imine group containing polymers can be enhanced by storage at temperatures below normal ambient temperatures, such as about 100C to less than 100C.Similarly, the stability is generally extended in duration at any given temperature when an appreciable amount of a reaction retardant, such as a volatile C3 to C10 ketone or aldehyde, e.g. acetone or butyraldehyde, is added to the composition containing both components 1 and 2 or when such composition is also diluted in effect by the addition of various materials needed to provide modifications of luster, color, and the like, such as fillers, pigments. The volatile stabilizer that retards the reaction may be used in various amounts of about 0.5 to 80 by weight, based on the total weight of the two reactive components 1 and 2 . However, the stabilizer may also serve as a part, or in some instances, as the entire vehicle or solvent medium for the coating compositions.Thus, acetone, cyclohexanone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl butyl ketone, diethyl ketone, methyl hexyl ketone, benzaldehyde, or isobutyraldehyde, may be used in low quantities or proportions of about 0.5 to 3 by weight or even in larger quantities to serve as a component of the vehicle or as the entire solvent component of the vehicle. The presence of a small amount of ketone or aldehyde as just described apparently is in equilibrium with primary amine groups in the aminolysis or amidation product used as component 1 . Much greater stability is obtained when substantially all of the primary amine groups are converted by chemical reaction and removal of liberated water of these groups with any C3 ClO, EMI18.1 ketone, mentioned hereinabove, and especially ethyl amyl ketone and diisopropyl ketone.EMI18.2 ketone and diisopropyl ketone is especially advantageous EMI18.3 Ubecàuse these ketones apparently have little tendency to become involved in undesirable side reactions.The compositions comprising, as component 1 thereof, the ketimine containing polymers obtained as just described wherein there are substantially no primary amine groups or one of the polymers containing mers of the ketimine or aldimine monomers of U.S. Patents 3,037,969 or 3,497,485 have extended pot life in anhydrous conditions. They also provide hydrocurable compositions which are adapted to cure when exposed to ambient conditions of temperature and relative humidity e.g. 20 250C and 20 to 90 R.H. . Even with the chemically combined type of blocked amine, there may be included additional free ketone or aldehyde of the sameEMI18.4 as that used in making the imine to serve as part of or all of the solvent. The compositions of the present invention may be applied to form clear, protective, and decorative. coating and or impregnant films. However, they may also contain various additives other than those which react to form the crosslinked binder, body, or matrix of the film. Such additives may be plasticizers, such as dioctyl phthalate, pigments and inorganic fillers, such as glass, titanium dioxide, silica, barite, and calcium carbonate, coloring matter, such as dyestuffs, anticorrosive agents, and waterproofing or water repellents, such as paraffin waxes. The compositions may be formulated by mixing component 1 with component 2 and suitable solvents, dispersing agents, fillers, pigments and the like and storing the composition, if necessary, at low temperature, such as from about 100C to 100C until it is used at ambient temperatures. If however, it is not to be used within a period of one to three days, it is more practical to make up the composition as a two package system, one package containing component 1 and the other component 2 with polymerization inhibitor, optionally with a monofunctional compound of formula IV above. Suitable solvents may be present in either or both packages. Pigments, fillers, and the like may be included in one or the other of the packages or even part in one, and part in the other.Instead of including the monofunctional compound of formula IV in the second package containing component 2 , such monofunctional compound or compounds may be included, optionally with a vinyl polymerization inhibitor in the first package so that it may have an opportunity to react with primary or secondary amine groups while in storage and or during shipment of the two package system to the point of use where they are mixed just prior to use. After mixing the two packages in proper proportions, the resulting composition may be used for coating numerous substrates, such as those of metals, wood, glass, and plastics to produce thereon upon ambient curing, with or without acceleration thereof by heating, protective and or decorative coating films which have an outstanding combination of properties, chemical resistance, rust resistance, durability, e.g. to weathering, i.e. exposure to UV light, rainj etc., and hardness, toughness, flexibility, and other mechanical properties, including lubricity, frictional effects, etc.Also, the factors of low cost and toxicity involved in manufacture and use taken in conjunction with the properties obtainable on cure provide a versatility obtainable from the compositions of the present invention such that in many instances they may beneficially be used in place of other ambient curing systems heretofore used. The compositions may also be used as binders for fibrous webs to form bonded non woven fabrics by impregnation of the webs and curing. Since the compositions of .the present invention do not depend on air curing, they are quite useful as adhesives to join sheets or panels of various materials, e.g. glass, metals, wood and plastics, such as those of polyesters Mylar , polymethyl methacrylates Plexiglas cellophane, and the like. In the following examples illustrative of the invention, the parts and percentages are by weight and the temperatures in Celsius degrees, unless otherwise specified. Also, the following abbreviations are used VT for vinyltoluene MA for methyl acrylate BMA for butyl methacrylate EDA for ethylenediamine M for number average molecular weight Mw for weight average molecular weight ME for milliequivalent d.p. for degree of polymerization t BP for t butyl peracetate KHN for Knoop Hardness No. obtained by Tukon tester R.H. for relative humidity MIBK for methyl isobutyl ketone MM for millimoles Example 1 a Preparation of Poly VT BMA MA 34.l 41.0 24.9 To 800.7 g of butyl Cellosolve 2 butoxyethanol , heated to 1400C under a nitrogen atmosphere, and with rapid stirring is added a solution of 464.4 g of methyl acrylate, 766.8 g of butyl methacrylate, 637.2 g of vinyltoluene, and 80.07 g of 70 t butyl peracetate over a period of 3 hours. The addition of the solution of monomers containing catalyst is made at a uniform rate of 630 g hour. When the addition is completed, the solution is held at a temperature of 1400C for 1 hour and then cooled to 1200C. Then, 8.0 g of 70 t BP is added and a temperature of 1200C is maintained for 1 2 hour before cooling to room temperature. The resulting clear, amber solution contains the copolymer of the three monomers in the percentages given in the heading at 69.4 solids and has a viscosity of 7300 cps as determined with a Brookfield viscometer at 250C using a num 3 spindle at 12 rpm. Gel permeation chromatography shows My 3200 Mw 9300 The calculated dispersity MMn is 3.10 and the d.p. degree of polymerization is 27.7.b Amidation of the Copolymer Obtained in Part a with Ethylenediamine A solution is prepared from 1500 g of the solution obtained in part a , containing 258 g 3.0 moles of polymerized methyl acrylate, and 121.6 g 2.03 moles of ethylenediamine EDA . Titration shows this solution to have an amine equivalence of 6.19 ME g and the solution to contain a total of 3.850 equivalents of amine. The solution is heated for 48 hours at 1250C under a nitrogen atmosphere with stirring until the amine equivalence is 5.07 ME g. After cooling to 900C, 300 g of butyl Cellosolve is added to the solution. Distillation under reduced pressure 90 110 C 15 mm removes 287 g of distillate. This procedure is repeated, 300 g of butyl Cellosolve added, and 362 g of distillate removed. Titration of the combined distillates shows a total of 3.06 equivalents of amine to be present. Ethylenediamine consumed by reaction with the polymer is 3.85 3.06 0.788 equivalents or 1.58 moles. Since the d.p. of the initial polymer is 27.7, of which 33.3 mole is methyl acrylate, there are 9.24 methyl acrylate mers per average molecule initially. On the basis that reaction with ethylenediamine converts methyl acrylate units in the polymer backbone to N 2 aminoethylacrylamide units, then 1.58 3.00 9.24 4.86 of the latter units are formed per average molecule as a result of the amidation. Gas chromatography indicates that the solution contains 1 residual ethylenediamine. A solution of 560 g of the amidation product is diluted with 400 g of butyl Cellosolve and 60 g of a strong acid type of ion exchange resin is added to remove the excess amine. The mixture is warmed on a steam bath and stirred for 5 ours. Initially, before addition of the ion exchange resin, the amine titer was 0.491 ME g and after removing the ion exchange resin by filtration the titer was 0.234 ME g. This corresponds to the loss of 0.78 ethylenediamine. A gas chromatograph of the treated solution shows no ethylenediamine peak present. The solids content of the treated solution is 34.1 and the amine equivalence based upon solids is 1.44 ME g. c Preparation of Coatings An acrylated epoxidized soybean oil, such as that available commercially under the trade marked designation ACTOMER X 80, with an acrylate equivalence of 2.8 ME g and practically no reactive residual epoxy content is diluted to 50 solids with butyl Cellosolve. The resin solution obtained in part b is divided into 30 g portions, each containing 14.73 ME of titratable amine. To each portion is added 2.0 g of acetone to retard the reaction with the acrylated epoxidized soybean oil. Weighed amounts of the acrylated epoxidized soybean oil solution are then added to the resin containing solutions as indicated in Table I following TABLE I Coating SolutionSubstance A B C D E grams amine resin 30 30 30 30 30ME amine 14.73 14.73 14.73 14.73 14.73 grams acrylate sol. 10.52 13.15 16.31 18.41 21.04ME acrylate 14.73 18.41 22.83 25.78 29.46 acrylate amine 1.00 1.25 1.55 1.75 2.00 acetone added g 2.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 After tumble mixing for 20 min. the solutions are coated on Bonderite 1000 steel panels with a 7 mil knife and then placed in a room at 700F and 50 R.H. to dry.After three weeks in such ambient conditions of drying or curing, determination of KHN of the first set of five samples is made on a Tukon hardness tester, then all of the samples are subjected to a baking for 24 hours at 1400F and the KHN of the same set of five samples is determined to provide a comparison of hardness obtained after 3 weeks of ambient cure without subsequent baking and the hardness obtained when the 3 week ambient cure is followed by the 24 hour baking. The rest of the results tablulated are those obtained on coatings having 3 weeks of the room temperature cure followed immediately with a 24 hour bake at 1400F.

This solution is designated 3A. A 50 g portion of the 3A solution is transferred to a second bottle and 0.50 g 1.0 water is added with rapid stirring. This solution is designated 3B.

Methyl acrylate MA B. Acrylic acid ester of a mixture of C16 C20 alcohols CEA C.

The solutions are allowed to react at room temperature for four days and the resulting solutions may be provided with about 7 to 12 by weight of a ketone, e.g. acetone.Then a 50 solution of Actomer X 80 is mixed with each of the prereacted polymers to provide clear coating solutions having various ratios of the ME of the Actomer X 80 and ME of amine nitrogen before prereaction ranging from 0.75 to 2.0. Such coatings can be applied as described in the previous examples. Example 6 a A poligomer is prepared by adding a solution containing 177.5 g of the methylisobutyl ketimine of 2 aminoethyl methacrylate of U.S. Patent 3,037,969 Ex. 2 , 265.5 g of methyl methacrylate, and 19.0 g of 70 t BP to 190 g of butyl Cellosolve while maintaining the mixture at a temperature of 1300C over a period of 5 hours.

After curing under ambient conditions for three days neither of the coatings shown any delamination, but both show moderate softening when exposed to 10 acetic acid solution for 15 minutes. When exposed to liquid methylene chloride for 15 min. the coating from the resin of part b swells and delaminates from the substrate indicating a crosslinked polymer network to be present.The coating from the resin of part c is unusually resistant to this solvent and shows no signs of swelling or delamination indicating the formation of a highly crosslinked polymer network.Example 8 Acrylate amine coating system containing a volatile acid as a blocking agent To 10 g samples of an ethylenediamine amidated copolymer of styrene and MA in 1.5 to 1 mole ratio there is added 2.5 g of phenoxyethanol and glacial acetic acid HAc in the following amounts Samples Equiv HAc Equiv Resin g HAc g Resin A 1.0 1.0 0.33 10 B 1.5 1.0 0.50 10 C 2.0 1.0 0.66 10 D 3.0 1.0 1.0 10 E 0 1.0 0 10 After mixing thoroughly, 5.9 g of a 50 solution ofActomer X 80 dissolved in butyl Cellosolve is added to each solution A thru E .The solutions are shaken until homogeneous, coated on Bonderite 1000 steel panels, and gelation times are determined on the solutions as follows Samples Gelation Time hours A 8 B 18 C 24 D 36 E 0.25 After curing for 3 weeks under ambient conditions all of the coatings on the panels are hard, clear, tough, rust free, and show virtually identical resistance to methylene chloride and 10 acetic acid solution.Example 9 Partial blocking of an amidated resin by prereaction with a monoacrylate To 10 g of the same EDA amidated styrene MA copolymer used in Ex. 8, there is added 4.65 g of isobornyl acrylate IBA and the resulting solution is allowed to stand at room temperature for 4 days. During this time the viscosity increases.
