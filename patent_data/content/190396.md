# Freezing frame for a plasma container.

## Abstract
The specification discloses a parallel piped freezing frame having a plurality of compartments 14 for freezing of flexible bags 33 of plasma or other biological fluid. A slidable freezing plate 11 is mounted within each compart ment 14 and cam means 25, 30 are provided for directing the freezing plate 11 downwardly and laterally against a side wall 12, 13 of the compartment 14 . The freezing plate 11 and associated planar wall 15 thereby mold the flexible bag 33 into a flat but slightly wedge shaped configuration. A freezing medium such as alcohol circulates through the freezing frame to freeze the contents of the flexible bag 33 .
