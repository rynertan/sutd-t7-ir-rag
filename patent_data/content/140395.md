## Description
The present invention relates to a water soluble derivative of 1 2 hydroxyethyl 2 methyl 5 nitfo imidazole having the following structural formula EMI1.1 The 1 2 hydroxyethyl 2 methyl 5 nitro imidazole, also referred to under the non chemical name of metronidazole , is known and used as a drug having relevant ectivity in all the diseases of infectious type induced by Trichomonas vaginalis, and is used, both orally and topically, with excellent results at a posology of about 8 tab lets, each containing 250 mg of active ingredient, administered in four times in only one day, thus giving a total of 2 g day.Owing to the insolubility in water of this active substance, the use thereof is limited, especially for the treatment of the anaerobic forms.The main object of the present invention is that of providing a water soluble and stable form, since the drug can be thus not only used with improved efficacy, but is also useful in form of vials mainly aiming to the therapy of the anaerobic forms.Such an object is achievecl, and this is the specific gist of the present invention, through the N 5 carboxy 5 aminopentan carbamic ester of 1 2 hydroxyethyl 2 methyl 5 nitro irnidazole, welch is not only perfectly water soluble, but is also endowed with improved therÃ«lpeutical properties.According to anc,ther feature of the present invention, a process is provided for the preparation of the aforesaid water soluble derivative, comprising the steps of a reacting, at a temperature of between 5 and 500 C, 1 2 hy4 4t methyl 5 nitroimidazole with an alkyl or phenyl chlorocarbonate in the presence of an organic base, the corresponding carbonic ester being thus formed, and b hydrolizing, in water alcohol medium and at a temperature of between 5 and 1000 C, the isolated carbonic ester by means of lysing hydrochloride in the presence of triethylamine.At the end of the hydrolysis reaction, the mixture is made acidic with hydrogen chloride and the end product is crystallized frcim water alcohol solution.In the above defined process as the alkyl chlorocarbonate, ethyl, butyl, isobutyl or phenyl chlorocarbonate is used, and the organic base is preferably selected amongst triethylamine, pyridine and piperidine, furthermore, throughout the specification, as water alcohol solvent or mixture, a mixture of water and a lower aliphatic alcohol, preferably methanol, is meant.The compound according to the invention is in form of a white, crystalline, ordorless, non hygroscopic powder,which is perfectly soluble in water and insoluble in anhydrous alcohols, acetone and chloroform, having melting point of 1921930 C. Moreover the compound of the invention has shown, in the preliminary tests, greater microbiological activity, whereby a therapeutical dosage lower than that of metronidazole is made possible, the therapeutical effect being the same, and thus an improved therapeutical index is obtained.Nevertheless for the therapeutical administration of the compound of the invention the already known dosages of metronidazole are foreseen to relet improved effects.A further object of the present invention resides in the pharmaceutical useful forms, such as capsules, tablets, normal and lyophilized ampoules, creams, ovules, washes or microtablets coated with the standard materials used for the delayed release forms and contained in only one capsule.For the delayed release form the microtablets must be dosed according to the number and not by weight when are filled into the caFsule, wince this form is formulated by using part of microtablets which are immediately bioavailable, without any coating, and part of coated microtablets, which are bioavailable over about 8 to 12 hours, whereby the drug is used two times within 24 hours.For the other pharmaceutical forms there are on the contrary used the normal excipients, vehicles etc, as well as the normal formulating techniques. The following example illustrates, without limiting meaning, the present invention. EXAMPLE a 0.584 moles of f 1 2 hydrox yethy O 2 methy l nitro imidarole are suspended in chloroform or methylene chloride or carbon tetrachloride in the presence of an excess of piperidine and 0.634 moles of phenyl chlorocarbonate are slowly added, at a temperature of between 50C and 50 C.After 12 hours reaction, the reaction mixture is discharged and the organic phase is concentrated under vacuum.A crystalline product is obtained, which can be repeatedly crystallized from alcohols and then dried for the use in the second step, until a constant melting point of 106 C 108 C is obtained.The process is likewise carried out using ethyl, butyl or isobutyl chlorocarbonate, with identical results.B In a water alcohol solution 0.44 moles of 1 2 hydroxyethyl 2 methyl 5 nitro imidazole phenyl carbonate are added and 0.60 moles of lysine hydrochloride are then supplemented by heating up to dissolution.Then a stoichiometrically calculated amount of triethylamine is added and the mixture is maintained at a reaction temperature of between 50C and 100 C for a time of between 3 and 25 hours.The reaction mixture is made acidic with HC1 and, after concentration, the N 5 carboxy 5 aminopentan carbamic ester of 1 2 hydroxyethyl 2 methyl 5 nitroimi dazole is isolated in a raw form.This product is repeatedly crystallized in the presence of silica gel granule size 70 230 mesh from a water alcohol mixture, whereby a white product is obtained, with a yield of between 20 and 60 , having melting point of 192 1930C. Like results are obtained upon identically repeating the process, except that ethyl , butyl and isobutylcarbonate of 1 2 hydroxyethyl 2 methyl 5 nitro imidazole is used.In the enclosed drawings the specific characteristics of the compound of the invention are shown. More particularly Fig. 1 shows the U.V. spectrum Fig. 2 shows the I.R. spectrum Fig. 3 shows the N.MR. spectrum andFig. 4 shows the high pressure liquid phase chromatography HPLC spectrum.The compound of the invention has been pharmacologically tested.As regards the toxicity the following results were found a in the rat per os LD50 1624 mg kg i.p. LD50 870 mglkg b in the mouse per os LD50 4000 mglkg i.p. LD50 4000 mg kgThe minimum inhibiting concentration MIC was investigated in five strains ofTrichomonas vaginalis, in comparison with metronidazole.Metronidazole was tested in form of a solution in dimethyl sulfoxide at a concentration of 1 mg ml whereas the compound of the invention was tested in form of a water solution at a concentration of 1 mg ml. The MIC for metronidazole was on the average 5 mcg ml whereas for the compound of the invention was 2.5 mcg ml. Kinetic tests were carried out in the rat with the compound of the invention and it was found that it is not converted into metronidazole neither in the organism nor in acidic environnment.More particularly it was found that the urinary excretion of the compound of the invention is of small entity after parenteral administration, it being less than 30 , which is an index of a not negligible biotransformation.To sum up the derivative of the present invention does not only fulfill the above mentioned purposes, but is also endowed with a therapeutical activity greater than metronidazole and is not a pro drug since no decomposition thereof in the organism takes place after the administration.
