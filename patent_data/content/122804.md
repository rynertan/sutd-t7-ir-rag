# Process for preparing carboxylic acids from olefins or vicinal dihydroxy compounds.

## Abstract
A process for the preparation of monocarboxylic or bicarboxylic acids by oxidative scission of olefins or of their corresponding vicinal dihydroxy compounds. An olefin of formula R₁ CH CH R₂ or R₁ CH CH₂ or a vicinal dihydroxy compound of formula R₁ CHOH CHOH R₂ or R₁ CHOH CH₂OH wherein R₁ and R₂ represent hydrocarbon groups such as alkyls, cycloalkyls, aryls and alkylaryls, and wherein moreover R₁ and R₂ may be bound to each other so as to form an alkenyl or alkyl cycle is reacted, under vigorous stirring, with H₂O₂ at a temperature from 0 C to 120 C and under a pressure of from 1 to 100 atmospheres. There is used an aqueous phase containing H₂O₂ and an organic phase comprising a solvent, the olefin or the vicinal dihydroxy com pound and a catalyst. In the case of an olefin, the catalyst is a composition of the formula Q₃XW₄O
