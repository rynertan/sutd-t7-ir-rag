# FLOTATION APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR ACHIEVING FLOTATION IN A CENTRIFUGAL FIELD

## Abstract
A gas sparged hydrocyclone apparatus and method for achieving separation by flotation in a centrifugal field. Hydrocyclone apparatus includes a vessel 52 with feed means 55 , product discharge means 57 and sink discharge means 68 for unwanted material. A gas phase is dispersed into the vessel through a porous wall 60 to form discrete bubbles and achieve flotation separation within the centri fugal field generated in the vessel.
