# Ear plug as well as a method and apparatus for the production thereof.

## Abstract
The ear plug 40 includes an elongate body with a rounded tip portion and of an elastic material enveloped by a deep drawn sheath 41 of thin flexible plastics film material. Rearwardly the plug preferably has a neck portion from which the sheath projects in the form of a stiffer collar or flange. Production of the ear plug includes deep drawing a thermoplastic film or foil into a sheath with desired thickness distribution, and filing the sheath with elastic material 53 . Filling may take place simultaneously with deep drawing, the body of elastic material constituting a die for deep drawing in a forming hole 45 , or after the deep drawing. In the latter case, an elastic die body is used to advantage, the shape of which generally corresponds to that of the finished plug, for deep drawing in a forming hole suited to the die body.
