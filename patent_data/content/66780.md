# Method of bonding synthetic resin fastener having fusion heat to flat film.

## Abstract
A method of fusion bonding freshly extruded synthetic resin fasteners B having male and female hook portions to a previously prepared flat film A on a bonding roller 4 by using the fusion heat retained in the base portion of the fasteners B . Prior to the bonding step on the bonding roller 4 the hook portions of the fasteners B are solidified and stabilised by streams of cold air 23 in order to prevent a distortion of the extruded fastener profiles 5 during the bonding operation.
