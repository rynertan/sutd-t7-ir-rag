# Vibration insulating rubber.

## Abstract
A vibration insulating rubber having an improved balance between its loss tangent and dynamic to static modulus ratio is prepared by molding and curing a rubber compound comprising as a rubber component a modified rubbery poly mer obtained by reacting 1 a rubbery polymer having at least one metal selected from alkali metals and alkaline earth metals bonded to its molecular chain with 2 at least one compound selected from organic compounds having a bond of the for mula N wherein X represents an oxygen or sulfur atom, in the mole cule, benzophenones having at least one of unsubstituted and substituted amino groups, and thiobenzophenones having at least one of unsubstituted or substituted amino groups.
