# Process for preparing pure benzoic acid.

## Abstract
The invention is concerned with a method of purifying benzoic acid, as obtained by catalytic oxidation of toluene and purification by rectification with the secondary streams being cycled back into the oxidation reactor, characterized in that the secondary streams flowing out of the stripping column undergo the following sequential steps a at least one distil lation and at least one crystallization in an organic solvent b scrubbing of the crystals obtained from a with the same solvent as in a c cycling of the mother liquors from crystal lization in a plus the scrubbing liquors as in b back into the dissolver d further scrubbing of the crystals from b with the same solvent as in a and cycling back of the scrubbing liquors, the crystals scrubbed as in d being optional y d1 further scrubbed with water.
