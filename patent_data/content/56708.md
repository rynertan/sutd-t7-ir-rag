# Anode stud coatings for electrolytic cells.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method for protecting anode studs by coating the anode studs with an outermost surface layer of titanium diboride, zirconium diboride, titanium carbide, zirconium carbide, or mixtures thereof. The anode studs which are specifically to be protected in this instance are anode studs for electrolytic cells for the production of aluminum. The steel anode stud is conventionally subject to high corrosion rates due to the atmosphere in the aluminum furnace, and the industry has long sought means to protect this stud from corrosion without inhibiting electrical conduc tivity, while providing high temperature resistance to oxida tion, and thermal shock resistance. It is also necessary that any coating applied to the steel anode stud be compatible with the carbon mass which is utilized as the anode per se. In accordance with the present invention, coatings of titanium diboride, zirconium diboride, titanium carbide, zirconium carbide, and mixtures thereof, have been found effective. It has also been found that the presence of up to ten percent by weight of molybdenum disilicide is advantageous, and that a subcoating of stainless steel reduces thermal stresses and improves bonding.
