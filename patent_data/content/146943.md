# Device for controlling access to a computer memory.

## Abstract
While a first access request signal is sent to a memory for a first data of a first data element number of leading through trailing elements, a register 12 holds a trailing address which is assigned to a memory unit for the trailing element. Responsive to a second access request signal for a second data, a difference calculator 13, 14 calculates a difference between the trailing address and a leading address which is assigned to a memory unit for the leading element of the second data. While the first access request signal is sent to the memory, another register 15 holds a reference number that is equal to a memory unit cycle time during which each memory unit is rendered busy by each access request signal. After disappearance of the access a request signal, the reference number is reduced one per clock cycle. A comparator 17, 18 compares the difference with the reference number to produce an access enabling signal which enables delivery of the second access request signal to the memory when the reference number becomes not greater than the difference in consideration of the number of memory units accessed in each clock cycle.
