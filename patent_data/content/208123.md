# Printed circuit motor.

## Abstract
A printed circuit stepper motor in which the rotor disc 1 8 is positioned between a permanent magnet assembly and a soft iron core. The disc carries printed windings alternately on both surfaces, alternate windings on each side being of opposite winding sense. The windings are connected in series between slip rings. A position encoder may be provided at the periphery of the rotor.

## Claims
1. A printed circuit motor comprising a disc shaped rotor rotating within a stator comprising a permanent magnet assembly on one side of the rotor and a soft iron core on the other, characterised in that the motor is a stepper motor, the rotor disc 1 8 carries printed windings 2 2 on both surfaces, the winding being arranged alternately on opposite surfaces, and being of opposite winding sense in alternate windings on each side, the windings of each side being connected in series with one another between a separate pair of slip rings.

## Description
The present invention relates to printed circuit motors. This application is divided out of European patent application number EP 83305856.3, publication number 0106595. French patent 2 399 754 describes a printed circuit motor having a disc shaped rotor rotating within a stator comprising a permanent magnet assembly on one side of the rotor and a soft iron core on the other. The present invention, which is defined in the claims appended hereto, provides a motor of this type, but which is a stepper motor. The invention will be further described with reference to the drawings, in which In this design, the printed circuit stepper motor has a high frequency response, and its differences from the conventional stepper motor are shown in Fig. 1. In addition to the mechanical assemblies such as the axle 1 1 , bearing 1 5 and case 1 3 , as in a conventional stepper motor, the motor of the invention is provided with a printed circuit flat rotor 1 8 , and a stator having one side furnished with a suitable number of permanent magnet poles 1 6 , and the other side with a flat iron core magnetic circuit. On the insulating board 2 1 of the rotor 1 8 , coil shaped conductors 2 2 , as shown in Fig. 2 are attached and arranged these conductors are attached on both sides of the insulating board 2 1 , and they may be of spiral or other selected geometric shape with a selected number of poles and slip rings the phase difference between the magnetic poles of said two sides is 90 so as to be capable of being driven in the conventional way for stepper motors. Its operation is shown in Fig. 3 and 4. Fig. 5 shows an embodiment of said motor furnished with pulse signal generating winding, which may cut the field of a permanent magnet to generate a corresponding A.C. signal, or may form an inductive detector together with an external sensing winding. Fig. 6 shows an embodiment of the laminae of said motor being furnished with photocell encoder sensing holes 6 3 . In this embodiment the outer rim of the disc shaped rotor is furnished with one or more than one hole 6 3 , arranged to transmit a light signal to a photocell, so as to provide an encoder function. The number the way of arrangement, and the number of rows may be determined in accordance with the actual require ment as shown in Fig. 7. Said encoder function may also be obtained by a load induction type of sensing means or other known method.
