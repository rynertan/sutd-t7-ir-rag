# Data recording system and apparatus.

## Abstract
System for determining supplementary feed rations for dairy cows, which comprises the steps of a recording in a hand holdable microprocessor based re corder 1 information relating to the cow identity of each of a plurality of cows which are to use a milking parlour, b entering information relating to the cow identity of each cow actually entering the parlour for a milking session, the recorder being programmed to validate the entered cow identities with the recorded cow identities, c entering respective milk yields in relation to respective validated cow identity entries, d after a milking session, connecting the recorder to a master unit 30 , and e causing the master unit to read the information in the recorder as to milk yield Y for each identified cow and enter this information into a central processor programmed to compute a value of feed concentrate ration R for each cow according to an algorithm having the general form R V Y M L t C , where M, L t and C are values for maintenance , lactation period and cow conditions pre recorded for each cow in a memory of the master unit.
