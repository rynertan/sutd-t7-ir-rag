# Extrudate and catalyst with high geometric surface area.

## Abstract
An extrudate suitable for improved gas liquid contact ing is made from a solid, transitional alumina. The cylindrical extrudate has a partially hollow interior and internal rein forcing vanes or ribs extending from the inner wall to the center of the extrudate particle. This extrudate configuration permits the extrudate to have the large geometric surface area per reactor volume yet, because of the openings inside the extrudate, the particles do not exhibit a large pressure drop when packed in a deep bed. One or more Group VI and Group VIII metals can be impregnated to form a catalyst which provides superior desulfurization and demetallization activity than do similar size particles.
