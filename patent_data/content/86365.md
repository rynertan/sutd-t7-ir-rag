# Aromatic polysulfone type resin hollow fiber membrane and process for producing the same.

## Abstract
An aromatic polysulfone type resin hollow fieber mem brane having a thickness of less than 100 µm and a three layer structure of inner and outer surface skin layers and a void layer disposed therebetween and connected thereto. The hollow fiber membrane of the kind has an improved burst strength, while exhibiting an extremely excellent water permeability. Such a hollow fiber membrane can be produced by a process which comprises extruding a spin ning solution of an aromatic polysulfone type resin in an organic polar solvent for said resin, said solution containing a glycol and having a resin concentration of from 10 to 35 by weight, from an annular spinning nozzle of which the orifice width is 10 to 110 µm while simultaneously injecting an internal coagulating liquid into the annular spinning nozzle at an inside bore thereof, thereby to obtain an ex trudate in the form of a hollow fiber, and introducing said extrudate into an external coagulating liquid.
