# Fiber wrap keyboard and switch.

## Abstract
Photo optical keyboard matrix including a plurality of light transmitting optical fibers. The fibers are arranged in rows and columns with light generating means disposed at the row terminations of the fibers and light receptors are disposed at the column terminations of the fibers.

Field of the Invention The present invention relates to optical keyboards and key switches and more specifically, to photo optical keyboards employing strands or fibers of material which are capable of transmitting light from a source to a receiver. 2. Description of the Prior Art Fiber optic keyboards and key switch because of the manufacturing and alignment problems in handling the various components of these structures have proven to be much too costly and unreliable to find a ready place in the keyboard market. The fibers themselves are relatively costly to produce while the utilization of multiple strands of plural fibers involves a time consuming and expensive fabrication technique. Thus a so called true fiber optical keyboard is relatively uncommon in the keyboard market place.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a new, useful and unobvious wrapped optical fiber keyboard for use wherever keyboards are useful and required, such for example as in data processing equipment, IO terminals, teletype, etc. Glass, plastic or similar fibers of suitable optical transmissivity are employed in the present invention and are automatically wrapped into a matrix configuration i.e. 4x 4, 5 x 7, 7 x 9, etc., to form the desired keyboard key layout in rows and columns.At each right angled bend point i.e. where the y column turns or curves to form the x row, the fiber is cut or sliced at an angle to form an air prism at the cut. Because of the difference in the refractive indices N2 and N1 of the fiber material and the air, respectively, with N2 larger or greater than N1, the light ray from the light generating source along an x row fiber bends away from the base of the hypothetical air prism thus formed, and couples into the y column fiber to direct the light onto the photoreceptor or photodetector. By introducing a light obstructing or blocking member,e.g. a key structure having a light passing aperture therein into the area forming the air prisms, the light can be interrupted or coupled as the key is activated and a signal can thus be developed which can be utilized as an indication of the key actuation.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Figure 1 is a schematic plan view of a fiber wrap keyboard matrix incorporating the present invention Figure 2a and2b are detailed views not to scale of a complete fiber and a fiber cut according to the teaching of the present invention, respectively Figure 3 is a schematic side elevation view of a key switch for the keyboard of the present invention illustrated in the inactive or light blocking position Figure 4 is a view similar to Figure 3 but illustrating the key switch in the active or light coupling position and Figure 5 is a schematic illustration of the hypothetical air prism formed at the juncture of the x row and y column of the fibers as a result of the cutting operation.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT Illustrated in Figure 1 is a schematic view of a keyboard matrix array in accordance with the present invention. As shown, the matrix 10 comprises rows and columns of optical light conducting fiber elements 12 such for example as plastic threads or strands of generally circular or rectangular cross section. Each thread or strand 12 is wrapped or laid down between a y column position and an x row position.A light generating means 14 such for example as a light emitting diode LED is disposed at the row position of the strands 12, while a light receptor means 16, such for example, a photo transistor or a photo diode is disposed at the column position of the strands 12. Energization of the light generating means 14 causes light to be transmitted over the bundle of fiber strands 12 to be photoreceptor means 16. As seen in Figure 2a each fiber is originally arranged in an L shaped pattern uncut between the x and y position. By suitably slicing or cutting each fiber at a respective elbow or bend area 18 a hypothetical air prism 20 is formed by virtue of the two facing angular cuts 22 and 24 respectively, in the x portion and the y portion of each fiber strand or thread as shown in Fibre 2b. It is noted that While the refractive index of air is N1, the refractive index N2 of the truncated fiber element 12 is substantially greater than N1 so that the light that passes along the x portion will bend away from the base of the air prism and will couple across the air prism into the y portion of the fiber.So long as the surfaces 22 and 24 form the hypothetical prism structure, the angular alignment between the two surfaces may vary, and still the light will couple across the air prism as stated hereinabove. In order to provide an operational keyboard device a series of light blocking members 26 are employed, as shown in Figures 3 and 4. Each member 26 includes a stem portion 28 and an identifying keytop 30. Stem portion 28 is provided with a transverse aperture 32 and means for retracting the key in response to key depression, as by the finger of an operator. The retracting means 34 may be a spring captivated within a cylindrical aperture in the lower portion of the stem 28. The spring abuts the base member 36 of the keyboard so as to provide a vertically movable key switch. By inserting the key stem 28 with its aperture 32 between the two angled cuts in each x y fiber, a light blocking and unblocking member is formed. As seen in Figure 3 with the key 26 raised to the inoperative position light cannot pass through the aperture 32 and thus no signal is provided with the respective y column receptor 16. However, depression of key 26, as shown in Figure 4 will bring the aperture 32 into coincidence or alignment with the two angled optical surfaces 22 and 24 and light will then be coupled across the hypothetical air prism 20 from the LED 14 to the photo receptor 16 causing a signal output to be generated through the associated operational electronics. In the 4 x 4 fiber optic keyboard matrix illustrated in Figure 1, each key is individualized for identification. Thus for example if x2 row fibers are lighted and Y1 fibers pick up light this indicates that key number 9 is activated. If x3 row fibers are lighted and y2 picks up light then key e is activated. If x3 is lighted and Y1 and y3 pick up light than keys d and f are activated and so on for all the keys depressed throughout the matrix above described. There has thus been described a new, novel, useful and heretofore unobvious photo optical keyboard structure which is inexpensive to fabricate and simple and efficient in use and operation. The concept is completely feasible and can produce by means of automatic machinery which include 1. Automatically organizing and mounting bundles of optical fibers in a desired matrix to form a keyboard layout. 2. Automatically cutting or slicing the fibers at strategic piedetermined locations to form the desired air prisms across which the signal will be coupled as the key stem is raised or lowered, and 3. Automatically inserting light blocking and unblocking keys and locking them in position to form a keyboard key structure.
