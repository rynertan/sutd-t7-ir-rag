# Signal conditioning method and apparatus for FM code signal.

## Abstract
A signal conditioning method and apparatus for precon ditioning an FM code signal prior to its processing by a limited bandwidth medium such as an audio magnetic recording track. The FM code signal is preconditioned to limit its bandwidth and alter its phase equalization prior to processing by the medium. The phase equalization is altered in a way opposite to the alteration performed subsequently by the limited bandwidth medium, such that the conditioned signal after recovery from the medium has substantially no phase distortion relative to the input signal and no high energy distortion. The invention is particularly useful when an FM code signal is to be mixed with an analog signal and the composite signal is first processed by a limited band width medium and is then processed by a further analog medium, such as an FM modulator.
