Other useful intermediates have the formula EMI7.2 where R is as defined for formula I . The compounds of the formula I can be prepared as follows 1 Compounds in which R1 is CN and R5 and R6 are H can be prepared by the following general method EMI8.1 The preferred source of cyanide ions are the alkali metal cyanide, particularly sodium and potassium cyanide. In a typical procedure, the compound II and sodium or potassium cyanide are heated together in a suitable organic solvent, e.g. dimethylformamide, at up to 1000 C, preferably 65 700C, for, say, up to 6 hours. It is preferred to add the cyanide dropwise to the solution of the oxirane over, say, 9 hour. After cooling the reaction mixture and pouring it into water, the desired product can be isolated and purified by conventional techniques. The starting materials of the formula 11 are in many cases known compounds see e.g. European Patent Application PublicationNo. 44605 to I.C.I. or can be prepared by routine methods as will be known to those skilled in the art, e.g. EMI9.1 tb SEP a SEP Cl SEP CL tb SEP Br.CI2CO SEP SEP IC2C03, SEP N tb SEP NH SEP SEP Br.

In a typical procedure, the nitrile is dissolved in a suitable solvent, e.g.dry tetrahydrofuran TEF , and the resulting solution is then cooled to about 700 C. A solution of n butyllithium in hexane is then slowly added dropwise. After stirring for about 1 hour at 700 C, the ketone III in a suitable solvent, e.g. dry TRF, is slowly added dropwise After stirring for about an hour at 700C glacial acetic acid in a little ThF is added and the reaction mixture is allowed to warm to 0 C. The product can then be isolated and purified conventionally. When one of R and R6 is H and the other is CH3, the product will exist in two diastereoisomeric forms and these can often be separated by chromatography see Example 34 . The starting. materials of the formula III are either known compounds or can be prepared by conventional methods see e.g.Preparations 3 i and 4 B . 3 Compounds in which RÚ is CONH2 and R5 and R6 are H can be prepared as follows EMI11.1 Preferably compound IV is used in its ethyl ester form.The acid is preferably supplied by using compound IV in an acid addition salt form, e.g. as the dihydrochloride. Alternatively the free base can be used and hydrogen chloride gas can be bubbled into the solution Typically the reactants are heated together for a short period, preferably under reflux in a suitable high boiling organic solvent such as 1,2 dichlorobenzene b.p. 178 , when the reaction is usually complete in about 15 minutes. The starting materials of the formula IV are obtainable conventionally, e.g. as follows EMI11.2 as dihydrochloride salt 4 Compounds in which R1 is C0NE C1 C4 alkyl or C0N C1 C4 alkyl 2 can be prepared by the alkylation of the corresponding starting materials in which RÚ is CONH2. The alkylation is typically carried out by dissolving the starting material in a suitable organic solvent, e.g. dry ThF, followed by cooling to 0 50C. A strong base such as sodium hydride is then added. After stirring for a few minutes, an appropriate quantity of alkylating agent is added. The preferred alkylating agents are the alkali metal iodides and bromides. For mono alkylation, only one equivalent of alkylating agent should be used, and, for dialkylation, at least 2 equivalents.The alkylated product can be isolated from the reaction mixture by conventional techniques. 5 Compounds in which RÚ is CONRêR where Rê and R are as defined in a or b in formula I can also be prepared as follows.EMI12.1 Compound V is preferably used in the form of its functional equivalent as an acylating agent , e.g. as an acid chloride or bromide, a mixed anhydride of the formula EMI13.1 or as a C1 C4 alkyl , succinimido, phthalimido or benzotriazol l yl ester. All these functional equivalents are preparable conventionally from the acid V . The acid chlorides and bromides are for example preparable by reaction of said acid with thionyl chloride or bromide, the mixed anhydrides by reaction with a C2 C5 alkanoyl chloride, the C1 C4 alkyl esters by simple esterification, and the succinimido, phthalimido and benzotriazol l yl esters by reaction with N hydroxysuccinimide, N hydroxyphthalimide or l hydroxybenzotriazole in the presence of a dehydrating agent such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. In fact, it is preferred to use the compounds V in the form of their succinimido esters of the formula EMI13.2 Thus in a typical procedure, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide dissolved in e.g. dry dioxan is added to a solution of the acid V andN hydroxysuccinimide in e.g. dry dioxan. After stirring for a few hours at room temperature and filtering, the reaction is generally completed by stirring the solution of the compound VII with the amine K2R3NH at room temperature for a few hours in e.g. dry dioxan, after which the product can be isolated and purified by conventional means If compound V is reacted in its free acid form, the reaction should generally be carried out in the presence of a dehydrating agent such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. The C1 C4 alkyl esters can also be prepared as follows EMI14.1 Generally some of the product VIII cyclises in situ under the reaction conditions to give the intermediate lactone A . The ester VIII and lactone A can be separated chromatographically. The benzotriazol l yl esters have the formula EMI15.1 These can be prepared as stated above. Thus in a typical procedure, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, l hydrowybenzotriazole and the acid V are stirred together at room temperature for a short period in e.g. dry dioxan. The reaction is generally completed by stirring the resulting intermediate IX with the amine RêR NH at room temperature until the reaction is complete, after which the product can be isolated and purified by conventional means. 6 Compounds of the formula I in which R1 is CONE2 can be prepared by the controlled hydrolysis of the corresponding compounds in which RÚ is CN. Typically this hydrolysis is carried out by heating the starting nitrile at, say, 70 1000C, preferably 90 954C, with aqueous sulphuric acid, preferably 80 , until the formation of the amide is complete as monitored by t.l.c. Further hydrolysis to convert CONH2 to COOH can be carried out under similar conditions, if desired. The compounds in which K1 is COOH are useful intermediates see route 5 above. 7 The amides of the formula I in which R1 is CONR R3 where R2 and R3 are as defined in a or b for formula I can also be prepared from the intermediates of the formula A as follows EMI16.1 where R, R5 and R6 are as defined for formula I , and R2 and are as defined in a or b in formula I . The reaction can be carried out by stirring the reactants together in a suitable solvent, e.g. ethanol, at room temperature until the reaction is complete. If necessary, the reaction mixture can be heated to accelerate the reaction. The product can be isolated and purified conventionally. 8 The compounds of the formula I in which Rê is H or C1 C4 alkyl and R3 is C2 C4 alkanoyl or said optionally substituted benzoyl group, can be prepared by reacting a compound of the formula EMI16.2 where Rê is as defined above in this method and R, R5 and R6 are as defined for formula I , with either an acid halide or an acid anhydride of the formula R .X or R 2O where R3 is as defined above in this method and X is CI or Br. When an acid halide is used, the reaction is desirably carried out in the presence of a base such as pyridine or sodium hydride. The reaction is typically carried out in a suitable organic solvent, e.g. acetonitrile or tetrahydrofuran. It is not generally necessary to accelerate the reaction by heating, and the product can be isolated and purified conventionally. 9 The compounds of formula I in which K2 and R3 are both C1 C4 alkoxy carbonyl can be prepared by reacting a compound of the formula EMI17.1 with at least two equivalents of an alkyl. haloformate of the formula EMI17.2 where X is Ci or Br. The reaction can be carried out in a similar manner to route 8 above and again the presence of a base is desirable. 10 Compounds in which R3 is 2 methylsulphinyl ethyl and 2 methylsulphonyl ethyl can be prepared by the oxidation of the corresponding 2 methylthio ethyl compounds using the appropriate quantity of m chloroperbenzoic acid in conventional manner. 11 Compounds in which RÚ is CSNH2 can be prepared as follows EMI18.1 The reaction is typically carried out by heating the reactants at up to about 100 C in the presence of water. The product can then be isolated conventionally. 12 Compounds in which K1 is CONE2 and R5 and R6 are H can also be prepared as follows EMI18.2 The reaction is typically carried out by stirring bis trimethylsilyl acetamide at 700C in dry tetrahydrofuran THF whilst n butyllithium is slowly added dropwise. The resulting solution is stirred at about 70 C for a short period, then the ketone III in e.g. dry TRF is slowly added, and the resulting mixture stirred at about 700C for a few hours. The reaction mixture is then allowed to warm to room temperature and aqueous acid is added. The product can then be isolated and purified conventionally. 13 Compounds in which R2 and R3 together with the nitrogen atom to which they are. attached represent aziridinyl can be prepared as follows The reaction is generally carried out at room temperature in dry tetrahydrofuran. 14 The lactone intermediates of the formula A can be prepared by cyclisation, preferably using an ester according to the following scheme EMI19.1 EMI19.2 where Q C1 C4 alkyl, phthalimido, succinimido or 1 benzotriazolyl. These esters can be prepared as previously described. The cyclisation can be carried out in the presence of a suitable base by stirring at room temperature. Preferred bases are tertiary amine bases, e.g. triethylamine, and alkali metal hydrides, e.g. sodium hydride. The compounds of the invention contain a chiral centre or centres and the invention includes both the resolved and unresolved forms Pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the compounds of the formula I are those formed from strong acids which form non toxic acid addition salts, such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulphuric, oxalic and methanesulphonic acids. The salts may be obtained by conventional procedures, e.g. by mixing solutions containing equinolar amounts of the free base and desired acid, and the required salt is collected by filtration, if insoluble, or by evaporation of the solvent. Alsa included are the alkali metal salts, preparable conventionally. The compounds of the formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts are antifungal agents, useful in combating fungal infections in animals, including humans. For example they are useful in treating topical fungal infections in man caused by, among other organisms, species of Candida, Trichophyton, Nicrosporum or Epidermophyton, or in mucosal infecions caused by Candida albicans e.g. thrush and vaginal candidiasis . They. can also be used in the treatment of systemic fungal infections caused by, for example, Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, Aspergillus fumigatus, Coccidioides, Paracoccidioides, Histoplasma or Blastomyces. The in vitro evaluation of the antifungal activity of the compounds can be performed by determining the minimum inhibitory concentration m.i.c. which is the concentration of the test compounds in a suitable medium at which growth of the particular micro organism fails to occur. In practice, a series of agar plates, each having, the test compound incorporated at a particular concentration is inoculated with a standard culture of, for example, Candida albicans and each plate is then incubated for 48 hours at 37 C. The plate are then examined for the presence or absence of growth of the fungus and the appropriate m.i.c. value is noted.Other micro organisms used in such tests can includeCryptococcus neoformans, Aspergillus fumigates, Trichophyton spp Microsporurs spp Epidermophyton floccosum, Coccidioides immitis and Torulopsis glabrata. The in vivo evaluation of the compounds can be carried out at a series of dose levels by intraperitoneal or intravenous injection or by oral administration, to mice which are inoculated with a strain of Candida albicans. Activity is based on the survival of a treated group of mice after the death of an untreated group of mice following 48 hours observation. The dose level at which the compound provides 50 protection PD50 against the lethal effect of the infection is noted. For human use, the antifungal compounds of the formula I can be administered alone, but will generally be administered in admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier selected with regard to the intended route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice. For example, they can be administered orally in the form of tablets containing such excipients as starch or lactose, or in capsules or ovules either alone or in admixture with excipients, or in the form of elixirs or suspensions containing flavouring or colouring agents. They can be injected parenterally, for example, intravenously, intramuscularly or subcutaneously. For parenteral administration, they are best used in the form of a sterile aqueous solution which may contain other substances, for example, enough salts or glucose to make the solution isotonic with blood. For oral and parenteral administration to human patients, the do ill dosage level of the antifungal compounds of the formula I will be from 0.1 to 5 mg kg in divided doses when administered by either the oral or parenteral route. Thus tablets or capsules of the compounds will contain from 5 mg to 0.5 g of active compound for administration singly or two or more at a time as appropriate. The physician in any event will determine the actual dosage which will be most suitable for an individual patient and it will vary with the age, weight and response of the particular patient. The above dosages are exemplary of the average case there can, of course, be individual instances where higher or lower dosage ranges are merited, and such are within the scope of this invention. Alternatively, the antifungal compounds of formula I can be administered in the form of a suppository or pessary, or they may be applied topically in the form of a lotion, solution, cream, ointment or dusting powder. For example, they can be incorporated into a cream consisting of an aqueous emulsion of polyethylene glycols or liquid paraffin or they can be incorporated, at a concentration between 1 and 10 , into an ointment consisting of a white wax or white soft paraffin base together with such stabilizers and preservatives as may be required. The compounds of the formula I and their salts also have activity against a variety of plant pathogenic fungi, including for example various rusts, mildews and moulds, and the compounds are thus useful for treating plants and seeds to eradicate or prevent such diseases. The in vitro evaluation of the activity of the compounds against plant fungi can be determined by measuring their minimum inhibitory concentrations in the same way as previously described except that the plates are incubated at 30 C for 48 hours or longer before being examined for the presence or absence of growth. Micro organisms used in such tests include Cochliobolus carbonum, Pyricularia oryzae, Glomerella cingulata, Penicillium digitatum, Botrytis cinerea and Rhizoctonia solani. For agricultural and horticultural purposes the compounds and their agriculturally acceptable salts are preferably used in the form of a composition formulated as appropriate to the particular use and purpose desired. Thus the compounds may be applied in the form of dusting powders, or granules, seed dressings, aqueous solutions, dispersions or emulsions, dips, sprays, aerosols or smokes. Compositions may also be applied in the form of dispersible powders, granules or grains, or concentrates for dilution prior to use. Such compositions may contain such conventional carriers, diluents or adiuvants as are known and acceptable in agriculture and horticulture and they are manufactured in accordance with conventional procedures. The compositions may also incorporate other active ingredients, for example, compounds having herbicidal or insecticidal activity or a further fungicide. The compounds and compositions can be applied in a number of ways, for example they can be applied directly to the plant foliage, stems, branches, seeds or roots or to the soil or other growing medium, and they may be used not only to eradicate disease, but also prophylactically to protect the plants or seeds from attack.
