# An axial flow fan impeller.

## Abstract
In an axial flow fan impeller having a number of blades, which are rotatably journalled in a wheel rim 3 , each with its blade root 4 which is connected with an adjusting device 10 for the blades, the wheel rim 3 comprises as a supporting member for the blades an annular body of revolution 6 with bores 5 for the blade shafts and a cut out for taking up a thrust bearing 7 . The body of revolution 6 is connected with the body plate 18 and the front plate 2 of the impeller through tubular con necting pieces 19, 20 , which are symmetrical relative to the body of revolution 6 and are elastically deformable by loading forces acting in the radial plane of the wheel, but have a rela tively great rigidity against forces acting in the axial direction. Thereby, the impeller may be designed as a welded con struction without the occurrence of dynamic loads exceeding the allowable values for the welding joints 25, 26 .
