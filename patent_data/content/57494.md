# System for detecting abnormality of molten metal in mold for continuous casting.

## Abstract
The system detects an abnormality of a casting metal in a mold for continuous casting, during flow of metal through the mold. The detection is achieved by means of at least one upper temperature detecting ele ment 80₁, 80₃, etc and at least one lower temperature detecting elements 80², 80⁴, etc located along the flow of the casting metal. A data processing system 90 monitors the temperature T
