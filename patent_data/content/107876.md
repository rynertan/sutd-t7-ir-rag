## Description
PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF AN AROMATIC HYDROCARBON MIXTURE The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of an aromatic hydrocarbon mixture, in which paraffins with two, three or four carbon atoms per molecule or aliphatic hydrocarbon mixtures consisting more than 50 w of said paraffins are contacted with a catalyst containing a crystalline gallium silicate which a has been prepared by crystallization starting from an aqueous mixture which, in addition to the components needed for the synthesis of the silicate, contains one or more gallium compounds and, if desired, one or more compounds of a trivalent foetal Y chosen fran the group formed by alu minium, iron, cobalt and chromium in such quantities that in the formula which represents the composition of the silicate expressed in moles of the oxides, the Si02 Ga203 molar ratio is 25 250 and the Y Y2O3 Ga2O3 molar ratio is lower than 1, and b after one hour s calcination in air at 500 C has an X ray powder diffraction pattern in which the strongest lines are the four lines mentioned in Table A, TABLE A d A 11.1 0.2 10.0 t 0.2 3.84 i 0.07 3.72 0.06, which catalyst has been subjected at least once to a two step treatment involving a step in which the catalyst is contacted at a teeperature of 350 700 C with a hydrocarbon or a mixture of hydrocarbons until in less than 5 hours 0.1 5 w of coke has been deposited on the catalyst, followed by a second step in which the coke loaded catalyst is contacted at a temperature of 350 700 C with an oxygen containing gas until more than 50 w of the coke present on the catalyst has been removed. The gallium present in the catalysts occurs exclusively in the crystalline silicate having the special structure and has been incorporated therein during the preparation of the silicate by crystallization from the aqueous mixture containing one or more gallium compounds. The preparation of the crystalline gallium silicates used in the process according to the invention may very suitably be carried out starting from an aqueous mixture containing the following ccmFounds one or more compounds of an alkali metal M , one or more organic nitrogen compounds RN which contain an organic cation or from which an organic cation is formed during the preparation of the silicate, one or more silicon cccpounds, one or more gallium compounds and, if desired, one or more compounds of a trivalent metal Y.The preparation is carried out by maintaining the mixture at an elevated temperature until the silicate has formed, and subsequently separating the silicate crystals from the. mother liquor and washing, drying and calcining the crystals. In the aqueous mixture from which the silicates are prepared the various compounds should be present in the following molar ratios expressed with the exception z ption of the organic nitrogen compounds in moles of the oxides M2O SiO2 0.01 0.35, SiO2 0.02 1.0, Six, Ga203 25 400, Y2O3 Ga2O3 1, and H2O SiO2 5 65. In the preparation of the silicates the base mixture may very suitably be a mixture containing a quaternary armrmium compound as the organic nitrogen compound, a sodium compound as the alkali metal compounds and amorphous silica as the silicon compound. In the process according to the invention preference is given to the use of crystalline gallium silicates which have been prepared by crystallization fran an aqueous mixture which, apart from possible impurities present in the reaction compo nents, contains no coppos of a trivalent metal Y. The silicates prepared as described hereinbefore contain alkali metal ions. By using suitable exchange methods these may be replaced by otter cations, such as hydrogen ions or ammonium ions. The crystalline gallium silicates used in the process according to the invention preferably have an alkali metal content of less than 0.05 w. In the process according to the invention the crystalline gallium silicates may be used per se or in calcination with a binder material, such as kaolin or bentonite. Olefins having two, three or four carbon atoms per molecule can be converted at a relatively low temperature and in high yields into aromatic hydrocarbon mixtures by contacting the olefins with crystalline mental silicates having a similar structure as the gallium silicates used in the process according to the invention have. A similar conversion into aromatic hydrocarbon mixtures of paraffins having two, three or four carbon atans per molecule and of aliphatic hydrocarbon mixtures which consist more than 50 w of said paraffins is much more difficult and requires considerably higher temperatures, which accounts for the important role played by cracking reactions and the low yields of C5 hydrocarbons. In this conversion hydrogen is released.In view of the growing demand for hydrogen for a variety of purposes it is important that in the conversion as much as possible of the hydrogen becomes available as molecular hydrogen and not in the form of hydrogen rich by products, such as methane. It has been found that catalysts cccprising crystalline gallium silicates with a SiO2 Ga2O3 molar ratio between 25 and 100 have a very high activity as well as a very high H2 and C5 selectivity. Catalysts canPrising crystalline gallium silicates with a SiO2 Ga2O3 molar ratio between 100 and 250 have a relatively low activity and C5 selectivity. The performance of all crystalline gallium silicatescnprising catalysts is greatly enhanced by subjecting them at least once to the above two step treatment. According as the catalysts are subjected to the two step treatment more often, their performance in the conversion will improve. This improvement continues until a certain maximum level has been reached where further repetition of the two step treatment ceases to produce any effect. In the process according to the invention the starting material comprises paraffins having two, three or four carbon atoms per molecule or an aliphatic hydrocarbon mixture which consists more than 50 w of said paraffins. The paraffins with two, three or four carbon atoms per molecule which should constitute more than 50 w of the feed are ethane, propane, n butane and isobutane. If the starting material is an aliphatic hydrocarbon mixture which, in addition to the paraffins man tioned, contains other aliphatic hydrocarbons as well, this mixture may contain, inter alia, rrethane, ethene, propene, butene, isobutene, butadiene and paraffins and olefins with five or more carbon atoms per molecule. In the process according to the invention the starting material preferred is a feed which consists more than 75 bw, and in particular substantially pletely, of one or more paraffins having three or four carbon atoms per molecule. A feedstock which is very suitable for use in the process is a mixture of paraffins with three and four carbon atoms per molecule obtained as a by product in the production of mineral oil. The liquid hydrocarbon mixtures obtained in the present conversion boil substantially in the gasoline range and have a very high octane number. They are therefore excellently suitable for use as motor gasoline or as mixing ccmpcnents for motor gasolines. The process according to the invention is preferably carried out at a tEmperature of 350 700 C and in particular of 450 650 OC, a pressure of 1 20 bar and in particular of 1 10 bar and a space velocity of 0.1 10 kg.kg .hours and in particular of 0.5 5 kg.kg l.hour 1. In the process according to the invention the feed is contacted with a catalyst containing a crystalline gallium silicate which is defined, among other things, by the X ray powder diffraction pattern which the silicate shows after one hour s calcination in air at 500 OC. In this pattern the strongest lines should be the four lines mentioned in Table A. The completeX ray powder diffraction pattern of a typical example of the present crystalline gallium silicates after one hour s calcination in air at 500 C is given in Table B.

Since investigation has shown that application of the two step treatment according to the invention to catalysts containing a crystalline gallium silicate having aSiO2 Ga203 molar ratio lower than 60 produces catalysts whose performance in the present conversion is not superior to that obtained when applying said treatment to catalysts containing a crystalline gallium silicate having a SiO2 Ga2O3 molar ratio of 60 100, it is preferred in the process according to the invention, in view of the fairly high cost of gallium, to use a catalyst containing a crystalline gallium silicate having a SiO2 Ga203 molar ratio of at least 60. As regards the number of tirres that the two step treatment should be carried out in order to obtain a catalyst with acceptable or optimum performance in the present conversion, the following may be remarked. In general the performance of catalysts containing a crystalline gallium silicate with a SiO2 Ga203 molar ratio of at most 110 may be brought to an optimum level by subjecting the catalysts at most three times to the two step treatment. The minimum number of two step treatments that is applied to catalysts containing a crystalline gallium silicate with a SiO2 Ga203 molar ratio higher than 110 preferably is given m 100 by the formula n . , on the understading that if the 10 afore mentioned formula, in which n represents the munimum nutter of two step treatments and m the SiO2 Ga203 molar ratio of the silicate, produce a value for n which may be expressed as the sum of a natural number N and a fractional number smaller than 1, the preferred minimum number of tines that the catalyst should be subjected to the two step treatment is N 1. The performance of latter catalysts which, by the application of the number of two step treatments given by the formula, has been raised to a higher level, can be enhanced still further to attain an optimum level by increasing the number of two step treatments. The investigation has revealed that the number of two step treatments to which the catalyst preferably is subjected in order to attain optimum performance is about three tines as much as the number of tines n, alternatively N 1 which, according to the formula, is the preferred minimum.For instance, in the case of catalysts containing crystalline gallium silicates with SiO2 Ga203 molar ratios of 135, 165 or 195, acceptable performance is obtained by subjecting them to the two step treatment four, seven or ten tines, respectively, whilst in order to attain optimum performance, the treatment should be carried out about 12, 21 or 30 tines, respectively. As can be seen from the above, both for achieving acceptable performance and for achieving optimum performance the two step treatment should preferably be carried out more often according as the crystalline gallium silicate has a higher SiO2 Ga203 molar ratio.In the process according to the invention both catalysts containing a crystalline gallium silicate with a high SiO2 Ga203 molar ratio and catalysts in which the crystalline gallium silicate has a low SiO2 Ga203 molar ratio may be used. The choice of SiO2 Ga203 molar ratio is mainly determined by two factors, viz. the fairly high cost of gallium and the expense entailed in the twnestep treatmenu. According as the crystalline gallium silicate present in the catalyst has a higher SiO2 Ga203 molar ratio viz. contains less gallium , the catalyst will be cheaper, but it will have to be subjected to the two step treatment more often in order to carry its performance to an optimum level, which then leads to an increase of cost. If, when using the present catalysts on a technical scale, it is the object to limit the number of twostep treatments to which the catalyst has to be subjected in order to bring its performance to an optimum level, then this implies that in the process according to the invention preference is given to the use of catalysts containing a crystalline gallium silicate with a SiO2 Ga203 molar ratio of at most 130. It appears that the problem of catalysts containing a crystalline gallium silicate with a Si02 Ga203 molar ratio higher than 130 necessarily being preferred on account of their price, whereas on account of the expenses entailed in a large number of two step treatments required to carry the performance of these catalysts to an optimum level, they are certainly not to be preferred, can be solved in an attractive way. The number of tires that the two step treatment has to be carried out in order to carry their performance to a certain desired high level can be considerably decreased if, before being subjected to a succession of two step treatments, the catalysts are exposed to calcination at a temperature of 600 1000 C for 2 8 hours.The preferred minimum number of tines that catalysts which have been subjected to previous calcination at 600 1000 C have to be subjected to the two step treatment in order to bring their performance in the present conversion to a preferred level depends, again, on the SiO2 Ga203 molar ratio of the silicate present therein, and for catalysts in which the silicate has a SiO GaO, molar ratio higher than 130, the minimum number preferably is given by the formula n m 100 30 wherein n andEMI9.1 m have the mEanings mentioned hereinbefore.In this connection it should be noted that when the above formula produces a value for n which can be expressed as the sum of a natural number N and a fractional number smaller than 1, the minimum number of tines that the catalyst should be subjected to the two step treatment is preferably N 1. Subjecting the pre calcined catalyst to a number of two step treatments which corresponds to n alternatively N 1 of the formula leads to the production of a catalyst with acceptable performance in the present conversion. Just as in the case of the catalysts which have not been subjected to previous calcination at 600 1000 C, so in the case of the catalysts which have been subjected to such calcination, performance, having been brought to an acceptable level by the use of the number of two step treatments indicated by the formula, can be further enhanced to attain an optimum level by an increase of the number of two step treatments.The catalysts which have undergone previous calcination at 600 1000 C are preferably subjected to the two step treatment in order to attain optimum performance about twice the number n, alternatively N 1 which, according to the formula, is the preferred minimum required to achieve acceptable performance.For instance, in the case of the afore mentioned catalysts, containing crystalline gallium silicates with SiO2 Ga2O3 molar ratios of 135, 165 or 195, if they have been subjected to previous calcination at 600 1000 OC, acceptable performance may be obtained by subjecting them to the two step treatment twice, three or four tines, respectively, whilst for attaining the optimum performance these catalysts should be subjected to the treatment about four, six or eight tines, respectively.If, when using the present catalysts on a technical scale, it is the object as in the case of the catalysts which have not undergone previous calcination at 600 1000 OC to limit the number of tines that the catalyst is to be subjected to the two step treatment in order to bring its performance to an optimum level to less than 10, then, in the process according to the invention when using catalysts which have undergone calcination at 600 1000 OC preceding the succession of two step treatments, the catalysts used by preference are those containing a crystalline gallium silicate with aSiO2 Ga203 molar ratio of at most 220.When using catalysts which have undergone calcination at 600 800 OC preceding the succession of two step treatments, special preference is given to the use of catalysts containing a crystalline gallium silicate with a SiO2 Ga2O3 molar ratio of 130 220. In the first step of the two step treatment basically any hydrocarbon or mixture of hydrocarbons may be used, provided that at a temperature of 350 700 OC and in a period of less than 5 hours a coke deposition on the catalyst of 0.1 5 w can thereby be realized. For this purpose the hydrocarbon or the mixture of hydrocarbons used as the feed in tbe process according to the invention is very suitable. The oxygen containing gas used in the second step of the two step treatment for the removal of more than 50 w of the coke present on the catalyst may very suitably be air. Preferably more than 75 w of the coke present on the catalyst and in particular substantially all the coke present on the catalyst is removed in the second step of the two step treatment. The invention is now elucidated with the aid of the following example.EXAMPLE Four crystalline gallium silicates silicates 1 4 were prepared by heating mixtures of NaCH, amorphous silica, C3H7 4NOH and Ga N03 3 in water, in an autoclave under autogenous pressure, at 150 C for 24 hours. After cooling of the reaction mixtures the silicates formed were filtered off, washed with water until the pH of the wash water was about 8 and dried at 120 OC, After one hour s calcination in air at 500 C silicates 1 4 had the following properties a an X ray pcwder diffraction pattern substantially corre spending with that mentioned in Table B, and b a SiO2 Ga203 molar ratio as mentioned in Table C.

TABLE D Silicate No. x y 1 3 0.33 2 1 0.2 3 1 0.125 4 1 0.06 Fran silicates 1 4 were prepared silicates I IV, respectively, by boiling silicates 1 4 with a 1.0 molar NH4NO3 solution, washing with water, boiling again with a 1.0 molar NH NO solution and washing, drying at 120 C and calcination at 500 OC. Samples of silicates I IV were repeatedly subjected to a two step treatment comprising a step in which the silicate was contacted with n butane for 30 minutes at a temperature of 600 C, a pressure of 1.5 bar and a space velocity of 8 g.g 1.h 1 and in which a quantity of coke ranging from 0.15 to 1.5 w was deposited on the silicate, followed by a second step in which the silicate was contacted with air for 1 hour at a temperature of 500 C and a pressure of 1.5 bar and in which 95 99 w of the coke present on the silicate was removed. From silicates I IV were thus produced catalysts IA and IB, IIA IID, IIIA IIIE and VA, respectively. In addition two samples of silicate III were first contacted with air for 1 hour at 700 C and then repeatedly subjected to the two step treatment described hereinbefore.From silicate III were thus prcduced catalysts IIIF and IIIG. Catalysts I IB, II IID, III IIIG, 17 and VA were tested in eighteen experiments Experiments 1 18 in the preparation of C5 aromatic hydrocarbon mixtures starting fran n butane.The experiments were carried out in a reactor containing a fixed catalyst bed. All the experiments were carried out at a temperature of 550 OC, a pressure of 1.5 bar and a space velocity of 2 kg.kg hour 1 The results of the experiments are listed in Table E.

Of the experiments mentioned in Table E Experiments 2, 3, 5 8 and 10 16 are experiments according to the invention. These experiments were carried out using as the catalysts crystalline gallium silicates having a SiO2 Ga203 molar ratio in the range between 25 and 250, which gallium silicates had been subjected to a number of step treatments according to the invention. These catalysts show a high activity and a high H2 and C5 selectivity.Ccmparison of the results of Experiments 7 and 8 carried out using a crystalline gallium silicate having a SiO2 Ga2O3 molar ratio of 120 shows that subjecting the gallium silicate nine tines to the twc step treatment yields a catalyst of excellent performance, but that its performance is not markedly enhanced by repeating the two step treatment 15 tines.A similar conclusion may be drawn from the results ofExperiments 13 and 14 carried out using a crystalline gallium silicate having a SiO2 Ga203 molar ratio of 180 , which show that no marked improvem t of the catalyst performance is to be seen when the two step treatment is carried out 40 times instead of 25 tines. Comparison of the results of Experiments 13 and 15 carried out using a crystalline gallium silicate with aSiO2 Ga203 molar ratio of 180 shows that the number of two step treatments may be drastically reduced fran 25 to 6 , if prior to the repeated two step treatments the crystalline gallium silicate is subjected to calcination at 700 OC. Comparison of the results of Experiments 15 and 16 carried out using a crystalline gallium silicate with a SiO2 Ga203 molar ratio of 180 shows that no marked enhancement of the catalyst performance is to be seen when, with the application of calcination at 700 OC followed by a repeated two step treatment, the number of two step treatments is raised frcm 6 to 30. Experiments 1, 4, 9, 17 and 18 fall outside the scope of the invention. They have been included in the patent application for comparison. Experiments 1, 4 and 9 were carried out using as catalyst a crystalline gallium silicate with a SiO2 Ga203 molar ratio in the range between 25 and 250, which gallium silicates had not however been subjected to a two step treatment according to the invention. In Experiment 10 carried out using a crystalline gallium silicate with a SiO2 Ga203 molar ratio of 180 the gallium silicate was subjected to the two step treatment three times, whereas the formula which expresses the relation between preferred minimum number of times for the two step treatment to be carried out and SiO2 Ga203 molar ratio of the silicate stipulates that this number should be at least eight. By subjecting the catalyst only three times to the two step treatment, one attains an improved performance of the catalyst, though comparison with Experiments 11 14 shows that the performance can be optimized by repeating the treatment several times. Experinwts 17 and 18 were carried out using a crystalline gallium silicate with a SiO2 Ga203 molar ratio higher than 250. As shown by the results of Experiments 17 and 18, the catalyst when not subjected to the two step treatment shows an unacceptably poor performance, which will not be improved by subjecting the catalyst to the two step treatment a large number of times.
