# Patient temperature monitoring apparatus.

## Abstract
Hospital patient temperatures are monitored by pro viding each patient with a battery powered transmitter 10 containing a thermistor 48 and reference resistor which is positioned over the patient s carotid artery. A receiver 20 , carried by a nurse, includes an actuator 24, 26, 28 for closing a reed switch in a transmitter near which it is posi tioned to activate that transmitter. Upon actuation of the transmitter, the patient s temperature varies the duty cycle of a high frequency transmitter output. The outputs of a number of transmitters, each associated with a different patient are elicited, one by one, and monitored by the receiver 20 which contains a demodulator connected to a microprocessor coupled to a visual display 30 . The microprocessor calculates patient temperature selectively in Fahrenheit and Celsius conventions. The microprocessor also detects low battery condition in the transmitter. The receiver 20 includes a self calibration test and low battery indication circuits.
