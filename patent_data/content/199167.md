# Compound flow plasma reactor.

## Abstract
A plasma reactor is described in which radially outward and radially inward gas flows are adjusted to maintain uniformity for different wafer sizes and to compensate for loading effects. Inlet ports are provided about the sides of a reactor chamber and at a central position in the top of the chamber, the latter being provided with a flared, tubular structure. Exhaust ports are located about the sides of the chamber. The gas flow from the side inlet ports have a tangential component.
