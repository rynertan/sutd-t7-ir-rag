# Auxiliary device for weft insertion on an air jet loom.

## Abstract
On a fluid jet loom on which a reed R is formed by an array of air guide elements 10 having front cutouts 11 for defining an air guide channel, an auxiliary reed AR is arranged movable towards and away from the reed R in order to temporarily cover the front opening of the air guide channel at least during weft insertion, thereby significantly reducing air leakage from the air guide channel for low power consumption and blocking plunge of weft out of the air guide channel for stable weft insertion.
