## Abstract
Apparatus for connecting a disk pack to a disk drive com prises a hub 16 carrying one or more disks 12 . A stub shaft 24 is axially mounted on the hub. A spindle 20 forming part of the disk drive has a passageway 50 at one end for receiv ing the stub shaft, an annular groove 52 being provided in the passageway and having a shoulder 54 . A recess 32 in the stub shaft has a shoulder and at least two balls 30 are dis posed in this recess so that they are movable between a first position adapted to allow free movement of the stub shaft into and out of the passageway and a second position adapted to capture the balls between the shoulder of the annular groove and the shoulder of the recess to prevent the stub shaft from being withdrawn from the passagaway. A push rod 34 urges the balls into the second position after the stub shaft has been inserted into the passageway to a predetermined extent and locks the balls in the second position against a force tending to withdraw the stub shaft from the passageway. A lever 64 is provided for manually moving the push rod to allow the balls to move so that the stub shaft may be withdrawn from the pas sageway and the disk pack disconnected from the disk drive.
