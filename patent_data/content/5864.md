## Description
Antigenic Composition Useful as a Vaccine or VaccineIntermediate, and Process for Preparing SameThis invention relates to an antigenic composition useful as a vaccine or vaccine intermediate. ore especially, this invention relates to an antigenic composition containing subviral particles which contain hepatitis B surface and or HBe antigens. This invention is directed to both the antigenic composition and a method of making the same.Recently, considerable attention has been directed to preparing a concentrated antigenic mass containing particles of hepatitis B surface antigen HBsAg . A number of approaches have been considered. For instance, Blumberg, in U.S. 3,636,191, disclosed the preparation of a hepatitis B surface antigen containing vaccine by subjecting suitable sera containing the antigen to a series of enzyme digestion steps. As a result of these sequential enzyme digestions, a concentrated HBsAg containing composition was said to be produced.The composition following purification contained hepatitis B surface antigen on particles having a particle size of about 20 nm. Blumberg recognized that the 20 nm hepatitis 3 surface antigen associated particles were in the form of a shell. Blum berg s composition had no core and was substantially resistant to various enzymes employed in the digestion procedure. Blumberg provided a vaccine having a density on the order of 1.21 gm cc which could be diluted with a physiologically acceptable medium and employed as an active immunizing agent.An improvement in the method of preparing an H2sAg containing vaccine was disclosed by Prince et al inU.S. 3,951,937, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein specifically by reference, which process involves the use of a series of treatments of H3sAg positive sera with polyethylene glycol whereby, after several physical separation procedures, a concentrated H3sAg mass was provided wherein the viral components could be readily inactivated, i.e., non infectious , and the same employed as a vaccine. The process has been considered to be useful in the large scale purification of K3sg. Other approaches have been followed to prepare vaccines which elicit an active immunological response. Thus, inUnited States Patent No. 4,118,479 entitled VACCINE FORACTIVE IIVIMZI IJIZATION CONTAINING F2PATITIS 3 SURFACE ANTIGENAND ASSOCIATED ANTIGEN, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein specifically by reference, there is described a process for preparing a vaccine against viral hepatitis which contains particles in the range of 30 to 50 nanometers. Also disclosed in that application is such a vaccine which contains a hepatitis B antigenic specificity which has been termed e antigen R3eAg . Thus, it has heretofore been recognized that vaccines against viral hepatitis were to be characterized by particles of a size of at least 20 nanometers. Moreover, it has been recognized that especially active vaccines, characterized by HBsAg and e antigen, could be prepared only from those plasmas having HBsAg, e antigen, and particles in the range of 30 to 50 nanometers. It was recognized, of course, that optimally a vaccine for use in humans would have to be safe and such vaccine, therefore, would have to be one wherein the viral components of the concentrated mass were inactivated. Inactivation of the infectious virion, according to the above mentionedUnited States Patent can be performed by serial treatment with cobalt irradiation, formalin, and beta propiolactone, using conventional procedures.It became desirable to provide a safe vaccine against viral hepatitis Type B containing 113sAg and H3eAg but lacking potentially dangerous components of the Dane particle core, such as HB virus DNA and DNA polymerase.As it has been learned that HBe antigen is a useful component of the vaccine, providing additional protection against reinfection, and as H3eAg is preferentially associated with larger particles, such as the HB virion the Dane particle , the difficult task was posed of preparing a vaccine out of plasma containing a high content of virions, and thus potentially dangerous, isolating the protective surface components H3sAg and XBeAg , and removing from the final product the core components HB DNA polymerase .In accordance with the present invention, it has been found that an active vaccine against viral hepatitis can be provided by subjecting human or other animal plasma to purification procedures to isolate particles containing R3sAg, preferably including a high content of Dane partieles, followed by an inactivation step which comprises solubilizing the HBsAg particles, where the particles have a size of at least 16 nanometers, with a detergent. According to the process, an ionic or nonionic detergent is employed which disperses at the prevailing temperature up to 0.1 percent by weight fat in an aqueous solution containing 0.1 percent by weight fat when 1 gram 100 ml of detergent is introduced therein.Suitable detergents include polyoxyethylene derivatives of fatty acids, partial esters of sorbitol anhydrides for example, commercial products such as Tween 80 and Tween 20 , nonionic, cationic and anionic types oil soluble and water soluble types e.g., commercially available Triton X 100 , sodium deoxycholate, Zwittergents , i.e., synthetic zwitterionic detergents known as sulfobetaines such as N dodecyl N,N dimethyl 2 ammorio 1 ethane sulfonate and its congeners, or nonionic detergents such as Octyl B D glucopyranoside. The detergent is added to the antigenic mass containing HBsAg particles of at least 16 nanometers diameter. The mixture is held under conditions sufficient to produce total dissolution of its particles.These conditions will vary with detergent concentration, HBsAg concentration, time, temperature, ionic strength and pH.Generally, the detergent is employed in the form of an aqueous solution. Its concentration in such aqueous solut ion will be between 0.1 and 2.0 weight percent, preferably between 0.5 and 1.0 weight percent. At 370C, an H3sAg concentration of 0.5 mg ml, and a neutral buffer containing 0.01 to 0.1 N salt, a detergent exposure of 1 10 days, preferably 2 4 days, is required. Higher salt concentrations reduce time and temperature requirements.As a result of such treatment, there is provided an antigenic composition, useful as a vaccine or vaccine intermediate, which comprises a subparticulate mass, which mass contains hepatitis B surface and HBe antigens. Stated differently, as a result of the detergent treatment, the particles are fragmented, whereby an antigenic mass having subparticulates results where the subparticulates each have a size less than 20 nanometers, especially less than 16 nanometers, and more especially less than 5 nanometers.It was surprising to find that even mild nonionic detergents such as Tween 80 will disrupt the 20 nm particle if held together with these particles at 370C for a sufficient period of time. The previous literature and experience had suggested that Tween 80, and similar nonionic detergents, do not disrupt these particles however these ex periments had not been carried out at a sufficiently high temperature, or for a sufficient duration, to effect the solubilization which has now been observed.Strong ionic detergents, e.g., sodium odecylsulfate, will solubilize the 20 nm particles however this results in unacceptable denaturation of the constituent proteins with substantial resultant loss of antigenicity and immunogenicity. What is also considered to be particularly surprising is that notwithstanding the fragmentation of the H3sAg bearing particles, the antigenic mass retains essentially all liBsAg and fiBeAg activity.Thus, there is provided a vaccine composition which is safe, in that it is free of potentially harmful comnonents of the hepatitis virus and yet is highly imunoenic. The antigenic composition of the invention is further characterized by the presence of lipids intimately associated with the protein moiety, giving the resultant antigen a density between 1.21 and 1.24 g cc at 80C in CsCl.The subparticulate antigenic composition of the invention is characterized by these subparticles which bear HBsAg and H3eAg. The subparticles, according to the invention, desirably have an especially small particle size, preferably less than 5 nanometers, and preferably are in the range of between 1 and 4 nanometers. As a result of the detergent treatment of the large particles, followed by subsequent purification, the antigenic composition is free of detectable quantities of deoxyribonucleic acid DNA , DNA polymerase, and hepatitis B core antigen HBcAg .The HBsAg antigenic composition which is subjected to detergent treatment can be of widely varying nature. It can be a finished vaccine which has been subjected to previous inactivation procedures or it can be any intermediate up to that stage of purification. It can be a composition provided by subjecting HBsAg positive plasma to a series of enzymatic digestions or it can be H3sAg obtained by removal of normal human serum proteins by physical separation procedures, including the aforedescribed polyethylene glycol treatment.Thus, one can subject the Blumberg vaccine composition, characterized by particles of a size of 22 nm, to the aforedescribed detergent treatment to thereby obtain a composition at least as safe, and probably safer, than the vaccine described by Blumberg which contains the HBsAg on particles of substantially greater size, and could thus contain residual traces of infective viral particles.Alternatively, one can employ as the starting material an impure HBsAg containing mass, such as is provided by some, but not all, of the enzyme digestions of Blumberg.Moreover, the procedure is useful in the treatment of those candidate H3sAg vaccines known as the BPurcell Gerin N.I.H. vaccine the erck Sharpe Dohme vaccine the MSUPAS or Institute Pasteur vaccines as well as the vaccine developed by the New York Blood Center, Inc.Detergent treatment is equally applicable to the treatment of e antigen HBeAg positive sera or negative H3sAg compositions, although it is especially useful in the treatment of H3sAg containing large particles of the size of 30 to 44 nanometers, i.e., Dane particles and filaments.In carrying out the process, it is preferred to subject 113sAg to contact with detergent in accordance with the following steps A. Contacting the antigenic mans containing particles of the size of at least 20 nanometers initially with detergent for a period of time of between 1 and 4 hours andB. Thereafter contacting the detergent containing antigenic composition with an aqueous aldehyde solution. Preferably, the aldehyde is formaldehyde introduced in the form of an aqueous solution where the formaldehyde is present in a concentration of between 35 and 40 weight percent, especially 37 percent formalin . The amount of formalin is between one part per thousand and one part per 4,000 v v .The aldehyde treatment is performed by maintaining the detergent containing antigenic composition in contact with the aldehyde at a temperature between 4 and 900C for between 1 and 10 days. Preferably, between the initial contact with the detergent and the treatment of the detergent containing antigenic composition with the aldehyde, the mass is subjected to sterile filtration.It is furthermore desirable to subject the aldehyde treated product following contact at 4 to 900C for between 1 and 10 days to diafiltration. then the diafiltration has been effected, the resultant mass can be diluted to the desired HDsAg concentration, suitably between 10 and 100 ugm ml. The mass can be buffered to a pH of 7.0 0.5. The final vaccine is then subjected to sterile filtration, filling and lyophilization.It is preferred, for preparation of a highly activeHBsAg vaccine, that the antigenic mass subjected to the detergent treatment contain HBsAg particles with diameters in the range of 28 to 44 nanoneters, and that these particles contain e antigen. Similarly, it is preferred that at least some of these particles be Dane particles and filaments. As a result of the treatment, subparticulate HBsAg and H3eAg containing antigenic mass is provided which is free of Dane particles filaments 20 nanometer particles detectable DNA DNA polymerase and hepatitis B core antigen. It is likely that the absence of core particles, DNA, DNA polymerase andHBcAg is due to a complexing of isolated core particles with anti 113c which is present within some of the Dane particles ar,d is released into solution by the action of the detergent.The resultant immune complexes core particles anti H3c carrot pass through the final sterilization filters millipore 0.45 and 0.22 micron average pore diameter , and are thus completely removed from the final vaccine. HBeAg antigen is still present as determined by radioimmunoassay. Following the entire inactivation process, approximately 50 percent of theHBsAg antigenicity, relative to the starting plasma, has been retained. The final product is conveniently stabilized with 0.5 mg ml of human serum albumin. The vaccine is clearly subparticulate.It is substantially free of anti H3s and anti XBc antibodies. The subviral antigenic particles have a density of between 1.20 and 1.24 grams per cc, determined by CsCl isopycnic banding at 80C, and molecular weights Daltons in the range of 100,000 to 1,000,000, especially 200,000 to 500,000. The process can be performed to provide the P.BsAg in a wide variety of concentrations. Preferably, the concentration of suchHBsAg bearing particles is at least 0.005 percent by weight, preferably between 0.001 and 0.01 weight percent. Thus, 113sAg is present in an amount sufficient to effect an anti HBs response when administered to an animal or to man.The process is especially effective and fragments virtually all of the HBsAg bearing particles of a size of 20 nanometers or more, so that the resultant composition is substantially free of particles of a 16 nanometer or larger size.Referring to the photographs appended hereto Fig. 1 is a series of electron microscopes of purifiedHBsAg. Pictures were taken after negative staining with phosphotungstate in a JEOL lOOB electron microscope at 80,000X magnification. a. Rate zonal centrifugation Pool I Dane particles and large filaments. b. Rate zonal centrifugation Pool II filaments and 22 28 nm spherical particles. c. Rate zonal centrifugation Pool III 20 28 nm spherical particles Figure 2 is a similar electron microscope of the product of the invention.From a comparison of Figure 1 with Figure 2, it is clear that the morphology of the subparticulate liBsAg mass of the invention is decidedly unlike the particles of HBsAg in vaccines heretofore provided.Figures 3 and 4 are similar electron microscopes of intermediates before solubilization by treatment in accordance with the invention.Referring to the graphs and diagrams herein Figure 5 is a graph plotting the log dilution and log CPM E indicating the method which has been used for quantitation of HBsAg in the product of the invention.Figure 6 is a flow diagram of a process for carrying out the invention Lot V . Figure 7 is a summary of purification data obtained by carrying out the invention Lot V .Figure 8 is another flow diagram of a process for carrying out the invention Lot VI .Figure 9 is a table similar to Figure 7, i.e., a summary of purification data obtained by carrying out the invention Lot VI .Preferably, one commences the preparation of a vaccine or vaccine intermediate of the invention by selection of HEsAg positive plasma. Preferably, the plasma is one which contains e antigen. Only 1 to 10 percent of chronic HBsAg carriers found among blood donors satisfy this criterion. The plasma should be free of znti e antibody. Preferably, the plasma contains Dane particles detectable by conventional techniques of electron microscopy negative staining of course the plasma also contains the 3HsAg bearing particles. The starting material is initially frozen at 700C within four hours of collection and held at 40C during the interval prior to freezing.It should be bacteriologically sterile.The plasma containing BsAg is then purified to remove impurities, notably normal human serum proteins, by initially maintaining the pH of the blood plasma within the range of approximately 4.4 to 4.7, resulting in a small precipitate which, together with remaining cells and cell debris, can be removed by moderate speed centrifugation, e.g., 20 minutes at 10,000 rpm. There after, the material is mixed with 2.5 to 4.5 weight percent of polyethylene glycol PEG , preferably 3.0 to 4.5.The lower concentrations, say 3 4 percent, can selectively precipitate large particle forms and, therefore, are advantageous under certain circumstances. The pH is maintained at 4.4 to 4.7. The weight percent of polyethylene glycol is based upon the total weight of the mixture. This precipitates hepatitis B containing antigen material of large particle size, e.g., 30 to 50 nanometers, as well as a proportion of the known shelllike hepatitis B surface antigen containing material.The precipitate is recovered and an amount of water is added such as to present an intermediate fluid having an antigen concentration the same or higher as in the original blood material. The pX of the intermediate fluid is suggested in the range of about 4.9 to 5.1, optimally 5.0, whereby there is formed a precipitate containing proteinaceous material and polyethylene glycol and a fluid phase containing type B hepatitis antigen further characterized by the presence of Dane particles and or filamentous material. The fluid phase is separately recovered and the pn adjusted to be in the range of 4.4 to 4.7. The fluid phase is thereafter admixed while it is maintained in this pH range with 3.0 to 4.5 weight percent polyethylene glycol, based upon the total weight of the mixture.Preferably, in such a separation, the temperature of each of the mixtures after the mixing steps is maintained in the range of O to 8 C during the production of the precipitates. The purification step is facilitated if recovery is augmented by the use of centrifugation following the precipitation steps. Polyethylene glycol which is employed can be used as such, or in the form of an aqueous solution, preferably one which is about 30 percent by weight polyethylene glycol. Generally, this polyethylene glycol is one which has a molecular weight in the range of 500 to 50,000, preferably about 6,000.Further purification can be effected by subjecting the purified antigens to absorption of hydroxylapatite using batch or column chromatographic procedures. In the latter instance, the partially purified antigens are passed through a chromatographic colucn containing hydroxylapatite to which they adsorb. Further purified antigens are then recovered using a multi , e.g., about 3 step, elution procedure. Particles of particle size 25 to 50 nm are recovered separately from a fraction of particles of smaller size 16 22 nm and the bulk of serum proteins. Additional purification can then be achieved by flotation isopycnic banding in a suitable density gradient as described elsewhere Prince, A.M.,Vnek, J., Comparative Evaluation of Hepatitis BVaccines in Symposium on Viral Hepatitis, University ofCalifornia, San Francisco, Franklin Institute Press, 1978, in press , the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated specifically herein by preference, followed by the inactivation steps described above.The composition provided by the process of the invention can be used as such as an active vaccine for viral hepatitis. The vaccine s concentration is adjusted to about 5 to 100 ugm, preferably 20 to 50 ugm, of HBsAg associated protein per dose, to give suitable immunogenicity. Antigenicity is determined by quantitative radioimmunoassay by comparison with the Bureau ofBiologics, B.D.h., Vaccine Standard preparation.Potency is also controlled by determining the minimal concentration of each batch of vaccine which gives a definite specific anti H3s response in guinea pigs, mice, or other suitable test animals. The vaccine must have a sufficient potency to provide an anti H2s titer of at least 50 milli International Units M.I.U. of anti HBs as determined by quantitative radioimmunoassay by comparison with the WHO International Standard Hepatitis B immune globulin preparation with a vaccine dose of 50 micrograms HBsAg given in two 50 microgram doses one month apart. Potency can be determined in test animals such as chimpanzees. Furthermore, anti H3s must remain detectable at a titer of greater than 10 M.I.U. for at least one year following the onset of immunization of these chimpanzees. Preferably, a vaccine is employed containing e antigen, in which case the chimpanzees desirably have an anti e response measurable by radioimmunoassay. The vaccine can be administered by sub cutaneous or intramuscular injection. inile the optimum route has not been determined, it is preferred to administer the vaccine by intramuscular injection. The frequency of administration is usually about two doses one month apart, which may be followed by a booster at six months to one year after primary immunization. Of course, the dosage depends upon the size of the host animal being inoculated.The subsequent doses or booster depends upon the level of antibody in the blood as a result of the initial immunization. Licensable adjutants conventionally employed in vaccine manufacture can be utilized.The vaccine is recommended for all persons at risk of developing hepatitis B infection, and particularly those at especially high risk, such as patients and staff on hemodialysis units, medical personnel, persons of tropical populations and those visiting the tropics. In the case of tropical populations, particularly inBfrica, Asia, the Mediterranean region and South America, where a high incidence of hepatitis 3 infections has been consistently observed, the vaccine should be administered sufficiently early in life to prevent acquisition of chronic carrier state infections which tend to occur in these regions during the first five years of life. When adequate supplies are available and effectiveness has been documented, the vaccine will be useful for all persons not already protected against hepatitis B infections as a result of prior immunity.The particular importance of hepatitis B vaccine lies in its role in prevention of the chronic hepatitis B carrier state with its attendant risk of development of chronic liver diseases, such as chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatoma. The association of a chronic hepatitis B carrier state and these diseases is now abundantly documented, and the role of chronic hepatitis B as a cofactor in the etiology of these conditions is also established Prince, A.M., in The Liver Normal and Abnormal Functions, edited by F. F. pecker M. Dekker, New York 1975 .The use of the new hepatitis B containing vaccine in the long run can have a significant effect in the prevention of these chronic liver diseases which are so exbtra ordinarily prevalent in those regions, primarily in the tropics, where chronic hepatitis B carrier state is usually frequent. For example, in Senegal, where 14 percent of the population chronically carry HBsAg, the attack rate of primary liver cancer is 50 to 100 times as high as that observed in the United States, where only an average of approximately 0.3 percent of the population are chronic carriers of hepatitis B virus.In order to more fully illustrate the nature of the invention and the manner of practicing the same, the following examples are presented EXAMPLES Large Scale Purification of iBsAg h. PEG Dreciritation 1. Pre turification The pooled plasma is adjusted to pH 4.6 and 40 percent PEG in distilled H20 is added to a final concentration of 2 percent w v . The sample is centrifuged in a Sorvall RG 3 centrifuge at 3,000 rpm for 20 minutes, and the sediment is discarded. The same centrifugation conditions are used throughout the PEG procedure. 2. First S G rrecinitation of ilBsr The PEG concentration in the supernatant from the previous step is raised to 4 percent final concentration. The solution is chilled on ice for 2 hours and HBsAg is removed with the precipitate by centrifugation.3. Removal of PEG The precipitate is resuspended in distilled water to 1 4 of the original volume. The bulk of PEG and some accompanying proteins are removed by centrifugation after adjusting the pH to 5.0 and chilling the sample on ice for 1 to 2 hours.4. Second PEG Drecipitation of MBsA The liBsAg from the previous step of purification pX 5.0 supernatant is precipitated by re adjusting to pH 4.6 and further addition of PEG to a final concentration of 3 percent. The preparation is chilled on ice for 2 hours and the HBsAg is removed by centrifugation. 5. Separation of two noDulations of HBsAg particles The HBsAg from the second PEG precipitation step is resuspended in distilled water in 1 20 of the original volume of plasma. The sample is adjusted to pH 5.0 and chilled on ice for 2 hours and stored overnight at 40C.Centrifugation separates mostly small spherical particles in the supernatant and HBsAg particles enriched in filaments and Dane particles in the sediment. The pellet is suspended in distilled H20 to 1 40th the volume of the original plasma, solubilized by adjusting to pH 7, and immediately readjusted to pH 5. The sample is chilled on ice for 2 hours and recentrifuged. The supernatant first wash is aspirated arid the precipitate is washed once more under the same conditions. Finally, the twice washed precipitate is resuspended in distilled H20 to 1 80th the volume of the original plasma and solubilized by adjusting to pH 7.0. This is product A in the purification summaries. B. Purification of MBsAg on hydroxylanatite The HBsAg separated into pH 5 supernatant and first pH 5 wash supernatant in the previous step by PEG preipitation is further purified by batchwise adsorbtion to hydroxylapatite and subsequent elution with low ionic strength phosphate buffers as follows The pH 5 supernatant is pooled with the first wash of the pH 5 precipitate. The suspension is adjusted to pH 6.8with 1 N HC1. 0.5 M sodium phosphate, pH 6.8 is added to a final concentration of 0.02 N and the volume is adjusted to 1 10 the volume of starting plasma.An equal volume of packed hydroxylapatite Bio Rad Lab prepared by low speed centrifugation Sorvall RC 3 centrifuge, 2,000 rpm, 5 minutes of Z suspension is washed twice with two volumes of 0.02 M phosphate bufier pH 6.8. The sediment of hydroxylapatite is resuspended in the total volume of sample and stirred on a magnetic stirrer for 2 hours at room temperature. The hydroxylapatite is sedimented by centrifugation RC 3 centrifuge, 2,000 rpm, 5 minutes . The supernatant is decanted and the sediment is washed twice with 1 8 volume of starting plasma of 0.02 M and twice with 1 8 volume of starting plasma of 0.05 M Na phosphate buffer pH 6.8 with 2 hours of stirring at room temperature before each centrifugation. The first supernatant and the 0.02 and 0.05 M Na phosphate eluates are clarified by centrifugation RC 3 centrifuge, 3,000 rpm, 20 minutes . The clear supernatants are pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration Amicon, PM 30 membrane . The concentrated sample is washed twice in the Amicon concentrator with 0.02 MNa phosphate containing 0.02 percent NaN3 adjusted to a final volume of 1 200th of the starting plasma of the same buffer. This is product B in the purification summaries.C. Purification of HBsA by flotation isopvcnic bandit The pool of small spherical particles purified by hydroxylapatite treatment and the preparation of HBsAg enriched in filaments and Dane particles from the pH 5.0 precipitation are pooled. Solid CsCl is added to a final density of 1.30 gm cc. The sample is distributed into centrifuge tubes to 40 percent of tube or rotor volume and overlayered with a layer of CsCl of 1.25 gm cc density corresponding to 20 percent of tube or rotor volume. The tubes or zonal rotor are then overlayered with a linear 1.25 1.05 gm cc CsCl gradient corresponding to 40 percent of tube or rotor volume. The samples are centrifuged for 24 hours at a g force corresponding to that obtained in an SW 40 rotor at 36,000 rpm.The individual fractions are analyzed for proteins by O.D.280 at 1 10 dilution, for HBsAg by RIA at 1 1,000 and 1 10,000 dilution and for CsCl density by pyknometry. The fractions with a density of 1.17 1.25 gm cc containing HBsAg are pooled and adjusted to 1 100th the volume of the original plasma.Results of Purification Lots V and VI 1. YieldThe results of purification of lots V and VI are shown on Figs. 6 9. Recovery of HBsAg was 73.8 percent forLot V and 78.0 percent for Lot VI. Yield of HBsAg based on Kjeldahl as 0.8 30 ugm doses ml starting plasma for Lot V and 1.54 ugm doses for Lot VI. 2. Characterization of Product a PurityTo determine quantitatively the extent of contamination with serum proteins, the quantitative sensitivity of the agar gel diffusion test was first assessed with monospecific antisera against the proteins known from previous studies to be possible contaminants tested against dilutions of serum or plasma containing known contents of the various proteins supplied by Behring werke . The results are shown on Table 1.Serial dilutions of the final isopyonic banding product, at protein contents Kjeldahl of 3.88 and 3.69 mg ml, for Lots V and VI respectively, were then tested against each of the nine antisera. Albumin and IgG were detected in both preparations and, in addition, smaller quantities of prealbumin were detected in Lot V and C3 and a2 macroglobulin in Lot VI. The quantitative determination, summarized in Table 2, indicates that the contaminants constitute less than 5.5 percent of the total protein forLot V and less than 5.2 percent for Lot VI. b e Antigen e Antigen e1 was detected in the final product ofLot V by agar gel diffusion tests carried out in the laboratory. e Antigen was also detected in this preparation and in Lot VI by radioimmunoassay. However, e antigen was not detected in the final product ofLot VI by agar gel diffusion.

Dane particles and filaments are clearly present. It should be noted that these will subsequently be solubilized by Tween 80 during the inactivation process to reduce potential infectivity. The antigenic content of these particles should, however, be retained in the final product.3. Inactivation of VaccineA series of experiments was carried out to define optimal conditions for exposure to detergent and formaldehyde during the final inactivation procedure. These experiments utilized a quantitative radioimnunoassay based on the linear relation within the appropriate concentration range between log dilution and Log CPN 3 in theAusria II radioimmunoassay Figure 5 . Test samples are compared to a highly purified frozen standard of homolog ous subtype. The method of calculation is illustrated on Table 9. The following summarizes the results of our experiments on the inactivation procedure Example 1A small vaccine batch was prepared from Lot VI using one percent Tween 80 treatment in the presence of 0.5 mg ml human serum albumin followed by Formalin 1 2000 for 3 days at 37 C. Following Formalin treatment and di alysis, the preparation was diluted to an estimated 50 agm ml based on quantitative RIA , sterile filtered, lyophilized and one vial rehydrated for assay.

As the method appears suitable for further use, it is described in detail.60 mg Lot VI isopycnically banded HBsAg was diluted to 60 ml in 0.15 M NaCl, 0.1 M Phosphate buffer pH 7.2 PBS and 1 mg ml final concentration human serum albumin HSA . A sample was removed, diluted 1 20 in PBS, 1 mg ml HSA P3S Alb and frozen at 700C for subsequent quantitativeRIA starting material . An equal volume of 2 percentTween 80 in PBS was added and the solution held for one hour at room temperature. A sample was removed, diluted 1 10 in PBS alb, and frozen as FI. The solution was then filtered through 0.45 and 0.22 micron millipore filters the FII sample was removed and frozen, and Formalin was added to a final concentration of 1 2000.The solution was placed at 3700 for 3 days, an aliquot BV removed for assay, and was then placed for dialysis against two changes 10 liters each of 0.01 N Phosphate buffer per 7.0 containing 1 part in 10,000 Thimerosol. An aliquot from the dialysed solution was removed as before PVI for quantitative RIA. On the basis of the results obtained, the solution was then adjusted to an estimated 50 Xgm ml by dilution with 0.01 M phosphate buffer containing 0.5 mg ml human serum albumin and 1 10,000 Thimerosol. A sample was removed as before FVII and the solution was sterile filtered 0.45 0.22 micron Millipore filters .Again a sample was removed FVIII and the solution was dispensed under sterile conditions in 5 ml volumes into 10 ml vaccine vials. These were frozen at 700C and then lyophilized and capped. One vial was immediately rehydrated with 5 ml distilled water for assay SIX .

Immunorenicity in Guinea PigsAs the inactivation procedure itself has been under investigation until very recently, extensive studies of immunogenicity in guinea pigs have been delayed.Present experience Table 4 suggests that extinction of immuno genicity is observed with inocula containing about 0,2 2.0 rgm HBsAg per guinea pig. There is clearly considerable variability in response between animals which will make it costly to obtain accurate estimates of immunogenicity. The results of an evaluation of vaccine prepared by Example 1 and starting material and FI samples from this preparation are presented on Table 5.Again, the variation of response between different guinea pigs is evident. This is reminiscent of results which were obtained in chimpanzees with the Purcell vaccine in which about 1 4 of the chimpanzees appear to be hyporesponsive to immunization. The uniform response of animals inoculated with the 113V standard laboratory standard of potency is 50 pgm ml should not be interpreted as indicating that this material is more immuno genic than the Example 1 materials, since in the previous experiment Table 4 , the same standard gave non uniform responses.Clearly, however, the material of Example 1 is immunogenic down to doses of 0.5 0.6 ,ugm guinea pig.
