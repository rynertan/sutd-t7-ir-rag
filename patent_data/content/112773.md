# Buried Schottky clamped transistor.

## Abstract
A buried Schottky clamped transistor is described in which the Schottky diode comprises a region of metal silicide 24 in the epitaxial layer 15 adjacent the transistor. The struc ture includes an electrically isolated region of N type epitaxial silicon 15 having an upper surface, a region of metal silicide 24 formed in the epitaxial silicon 15 adjacent the upper surface, an emitter region 33 of first conductivity type also formed in the epitaxial silicon adjacent the upper surface, base region 29 of opposite conductivity type adjacent the upper surface which separates the emitter 33 from the metal silicide 24, and metal connections 37, 38 and 39 for making electrical connections to each of the regions of metal silicide 24, the emitter region 33, and the epitaxial silicon 15.
