This invention relates to non steroidal anti inflammatory agents, such as are useful for the treatment of arthritis. In its broadest aspect, the present invention provides a compound of general formula 11 The invention encompasses compounds having anti arthritic activity and being of general formula 1 Preferred embodiments include the compound of general formula 1, wherein X is SCH₃ and Y is NHCH₂CO₂H i.e. 4 carboxymethylamino 2 methylthio 7 phenylpyrazolo 1,5 a 1,3,5 triazine the compound of general formula 1, wherein X is SCH₃ and Y is The invention also encompasses compounds of general formula 2 Preferred embodiments include the compound of general formula 2, wherein A is SCH₃ and B is The invention in other aspects provides a compound as described above for use in medicine a pharmaceutical or veterinary composition comprising a compound as described above and a pharmaceutically or veterinarily acceptable carrier therefor and the use of a compound as described above in the preparation of an anti inflammatory agent. In addition to anti arthritic activity, when a therapeutically effective amount of the compound is administered in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, e.g. magnesium crbonate or lactose, the compounds have antiulcer activity against ulcers induced by dimaprit and indomethacin, and can provide anti inflammatory action without gastric irritation. When injected or administered in the form of a pill, tablet, capsule, or liquid, the compounds are non toxic, non mutagenic, stable and, in the case of the orally administerable formulations which are preferred , will pass through the stomach without losing their effectiveness. Other features and advantages will be apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments, and from the claims. The compounds of the invention have the general formula 11 , which may be classified into general formulae 1 and 2 . Examples of preferred compounds are those referred to as preferred embodiments above. The compounds are derivatives of 7 phenylpyrazolo 1,5 a 1,3,5 triazine having a nitrogen at the ring junction. All the compounds can exhibit tautomerism, and the formulae are intended to cover all tautomers. The compounds or pharmaceutically acceptable salts therefor can be administered alone or in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. Acceptable salts include hydrochlorides, hydrobromides, and sulphates. Particularly useful organic acid salts are citrates, acetates, maleates, and fumarates. For oral administration the pharmaceutical composition can most conveniently be in the form of capsules or tablets, which may be slow release tablets. The composition can also be in the form of a dragee or syrup. A process for the preparation of compounds of general formula 11 also forms part of the invention and comprises either More specifically, compounds of formula 1 may be synthesized as follows. The starting material is an amine of formula 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 or 7 3 NH where R² and R³ are the same or different lower C₁ C₄ alkyl groups 4 HO CH₂ The amine undergoes a condensation reaction with a reagent such as The condensation reaction is preferably carried out in an inert protic solvent, e.g. water, alcohol, ethoxyethanol, tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile, dimethyformamide, or a mixture of these solvents at room temperature. If necessary, a base such as KOH, NaOH, K₂CO₃, NaHCO₃, or triethylamine can be used as an acid scavenger. Compounds within formula 8 can be synthesized according to known methods, e.g. Capuno The compounds of Formula 2 can be synthesized as follows. A compound of Formula 9 The above described alkylating agents are commercially available or can be synthesized according to known methods, e.g. K. Senga The following examples illustrate but do not limit the invention. 1.2ml 1N NaOMe is added to a suspension of L methionine 150 mg in 5 ml methanol, followed by 290 mg of 4 methoxy 2 methylthio 7 phenylpyrazolo 1,5 a 1, 3, 5 triazine and the mixture is stirred at room temperature for 1 hr. After evaporation of solvent 4 ml 1N NaOMe is added to a suspension of 270 mg of 4 methoxy 2 methylthio 7 phenylpyrazolo 1,5 a 1,3,5 triazine and 520 mg of 2 pyridylmethylthioethyl amine dihydrobromide in 10 ml MeOH.

After a clear solution is obtained, a solution of 330 mg of 2 picolyl chloride hydrochloride in 2 ml ethanol is added and the mixture is stirred at room temperature for 1 hr. The mixture is acidified with acetic acid pH 4 and the resulting colourless precipitate is collected by filtration. The precipitate is washed sequentially with water, ethanol, and ether, then dried to yield 590 mg of colourless solid. m.p. 233 234 C decomposition .

The mixture is stirred at room temperature overnight, filtered, and the filter cake washed with dimethylformamide. After evaporation fo solvent 2 3 pyridylmethyl thio 7 phenylpyrazolo 1,5 a 1,3,5 triazine 4 one 2 4 pyridylmethyl thio 7 phenylpyrazolo 1,5 a 1,3,5 triazine 4 one 2 benzylthio 7 phenylpyrazolo 1,5 a 1,3,5 triazine 4 one and 3 benzyl 2 methylthio 7 phenylpyrazolo 1,5 a 1,3,5 triazine 4 one are prepared in analogous fashion by making appropriate modifications of the procedures described in Examples 7 and 8. When administered to mammals alone or together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier substance e.g. orally, topically, intravenously, parenterally, nasally, or by suppository , the compounds of the invention are useful for the treatment of arthritis. The compounds of the invention can also be used to prevent peptic ulcers, and to treat reflux esophagitis, acute erosive gastritis, and pancreatic insufficiency. The compounds of the invention inhibit ulcers induced by non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs, e.g. aspirin and indomethacin, without inhibiting their anti inflammatory and analgesic activity. Thus the compounds can be particularly useful in treating or preventing gastric ulcers in patients, e.g. arthritics, who consume non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs. The anti inflammatory action of the compounds can even reduce or eliminate the dosage required of non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs. The compounds can be adminstered to a mammal in a dosage of 5 to 100 mg kg day, preferably 10 to 50 mg kg day. Other embodiments are within the following claims.
