# X ray examination apparatus.

## Abstract
A detector slit 7 for the ϑ rotation in an X ray examination apparatus utilizing the Seemann Bohlin focus sing principle is suspended in a mechanical arm 26 which is capable to rotate about a real shaft 31 through the centre of the focussing circle. The Seemann Bohlin system is for Ψ adjustment tiltable about an axis 11 through an irradiated area 47 on an object 1 to be examined. The re adjustment of the detector 21 during the ϑ rotation is controlled by a device which provides the detector rotation, for example, with a 1 2 gearwheel transmissions. For automatic limita tion of a ϑ path to be chosen, the detector housing 23 comprises an abutment pin 75 which cooperates with switching elements 77 connected to the mechanical arm 26 . An X ray tube 83 has a construction of reduced length and is connected to a high voltage source via a rotatable right angled connector 87 .
