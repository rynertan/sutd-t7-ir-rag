## Description
Recombinant DNA technology permits large scale production of eucaryotic proteins in bacteria. However, the proteins so produced, are frequently characterized by the addition of an extra methionine residue at their N terminus. This occurs because translation is always initiated at the AUG codon which codes for methionine. In procaryotes, the N terminal methionine is frequently enzymatically removed. However, it appears that this is not the case for many eucaryotic proteins produced in bacteria. Possibly this is due to the fact that the proteins are massively overproduced and thus overwhelm the bacteria s processing capabilities. Another possible explanation is that the bacterial processing enzymes do not recognize the foreign eucaryotic proteins as their substrates. In eucaryotes, mature proteins often lack an N terminal methionine because they have undergone extensive processing by both endopeptidases and exopeptidases, during transport from the site of synthesis to their final location. As the presence of an N terminal methionine on eucaryotic proteins may cause an immune reaction when administered to eucaryotes, it would be desirable to process eucaryotic proteins produced in bacteria to remove the N terminal methionine, thus producing the mature eucaryotic protein. Most available aminopeptidases are zinc metalloenzymes. They are comprised of several subunits and have very high molecular weights.

This invention provides a method of removing the N terminal methionine and its adjacent amino acid from human, bovine, porcine and chicken growth hormone molecules or analogs of such molecules after they have been produced in bacteria. In certain embodiments of the invention the amino acid residue or sequence of residues which stops the action of the aminopeptidase is located adjacent the N terminal methionine. In this situation the aminopeptidase will remove the N terminal methionine residue only. In another embodiment of the invention the amino acid residue or sequence of residues which stops the action of the aminopeptidase is located adjacent the leucine in the molecule Met Leu hGH. In this situation, the aminopeptidase will remove both the N terminal methionine residue and the leucine residue. In other embodiments of the invention the residue or sequence of residues which stop the action of the aminopeptidase is separated from the N terminal methionine by one or more amino acid residues.

In the case of the Aeromonas aminopeptidase used according to the invention the amino acid residue which stops the action of the enzyme can be either aspartic acid or glutamic acid. In addition, a residue sequence comprising an amino acid other than proline bound to the N terminus of a proline also functions as a stopping signal.

This Phe Pro sequence is the N terminus of many natural animal growth hormone molecules. In a specific embodiment of the invention the N terminal methionine is removed from animal growth hormone molecules produced by recombinant DNA methods in bacteria and which as a result of such production have a Met Phe Pro sequence at their N terminus. In another embodiment of the invention the N terminal methionine and its adjacent leucine residue are both removed from animal growth hormone molecules produced by recombinant DNA methods in bacteria and which as a result of such production have a Met Leu Phe Pro sequence at their N terminus. In specific embodiments of the invention the eucaryotic polypeptides are analogs of bovine growth hormone bGH . These analogs contain the sequences Met Asp Gln or Met Phe as their N terminal sequence. The methionine is added to the N terminus of these growth hormones when they are produced by recombinant DNA methods in bacteria. After removal of the N terminal methionine by the Aeromonas aminopeptidase, Asp Gln bGH and bGH are recovered respectively. The bGH used in this experiment was the phenyalanine form of bGH which has a phenyalanine residue as its N terminus in its natural state. These methods also apply, however, to removal of N terminal methionine from the terminus of the alanine form of bGH, which contains an alanine on the N terminus of its natural form although in this case the alanine residue may also be removed.

The activity of the The invention also concerns polypeptide analogs produced by the methods of this invention such as human, bovine, porcine and chicken growth hormones or growth hormone analogs such as Asp Gln bGH. Another aspect of the invention is a method of preparing an analog of a eucaryotic polypeptide which comprises providing a first analog in bacteria by expression of a gene encoding the analog of the eucaryotic polypeptide. The N terminal methionine residue or an N terminal methionine residue and its adjacent leucine residue of this analog is then removed by the method of this invention with an aminopeptidase, e.g. The recovery of the analog may be optimized by removing the free N terminal methionine and leucine residues cleaved from the polypeptide analog by the aminopeptidase. Removal of the free amino acids drives the reaction to completion. The removal may be by any method known to those of ordinary skill in the art, e.g. ultrafiltration or dialysis. The invention also concerns analogs of eucaryotic polypeptides prepared by the methods of this invention such as growth hormones, e.g. human, bovine, and porcine growth hormone. Preequilibration and elution from the G 75 column were performed in the presence of 5 micromolar ZnCl₂ rather than 50 micromolar ZnCl₂ employed in the original procedure. Purification on the DEAE Sephadex A 50 column was performed by preequilibration of the column with 0.1M NaCl in 10 mM Tris HCl, pH 8.0 containing 5 micromolar ZnCl₂, application of the sample and gradient elution with 0.6 M NaCl in the same buffer containing 5 micromolar ZnCl₂ . After the salt concentration increased to about 0.5M the column was eluted with 0.7M NaCl in the same buffer. The major peak which eluted from the column was collected and dialyzed against 10 mM Tris HCl, 0.1 M NaCl, pH 8.0 containing 5 micromoles ZnCl₂ and then kept frozen to 20 C. Prior to reaction with the growth hormones the enzyme solution was incubated at 70 for 2 hrs. to inactivate any possible traces of endopeptidase activity that might have been retained in the preparation and reactivated after prolonged storage. For large scale experiments the enzyme was incubated at 70 C for 3 h prior to reaction with the hormone. Amino acid analysis was performed on a Dionex D 502 amino acid analyzer. Amino acid sequence analysis was carried out with an Applied Biosystems Gas Phase Sequencer followed by high performance liquid chromatography of the PTH amino acids. Prior to reaction with Met hGH a sample of the aminopeptidase eluted from the DEAE Sephadex A 50 column, 0.63 mg ml in 10 mM Tris HCl, 0.1M NaCl, pH 8.0, was incubated at 70 C for 2h to inactivate traces of endopeptidase activity. The enzyme was then diluted 3 1 with 2M Tris HCl, pH 9.5 to a final concentration of 0.4725 mg ml enzyme. Met hGH was dissolved to 8mg ml by weight in 10mM Na Borate, pH 9.5. Nine hundred microliters of Met hGH solution and 19 microliters of the aminopeptidase solution were mixed and incubated at 37 . 50 microliter aliquots were taken after 2 min, 5 min, 10 min, 15 min, 30 min, 60 min, 2h, 4h and 22h and precipitated by adding an equal volume of 3 sulfosalicylic acid solution in water, incubating at 37 for 15 min and then centrifuging in an Eppendorf bench centrifuge. 50 microliter samples of the supernatant were taken for direct amino acid analysis without acid hydrolysis . Control experiments were run by precipitating Met hGH solution 8 mg ml alone, directly after dissolution at time t The release of methionine and that of leucine are depicted as a function of time in Figure 1. The N terminal sequence of Met hGH is shown in Table IV. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the products reveals no detectable degradation of the hGH. Prior to reaction with Met Asp Gln bGH a sample of the aminopeptidase eluted from the DEAE Sephadex A 50 column was heated at 70 C and diluted as described in Example I. Met Asp Gln bGH was dissolved to 8mg ml by weight in 10 mM Na Borate, pH 9.5. 750 microliters of Met Asp Gln bGH solution and 32 microliters of the aminopeptidase solution were mixed and incubated at 37 . 50 microliter aliquots were taken after 5 min, 10 min, 15 min, 30 min, 60 min, 2h, 4h and 22h and precipitated by adding an equal volume of 3 sulfosalicylic acid solution in water, incubating at 37 C for 15 min and centrifuging in an Eppendorf bench centrifuge. Again 50 microliter samples were taken for amino acid analysis. Control experiments were run by precipitating Met Asp Gln bGH solution 8 mg ml alone either directly after dissolution at t The release of free methionine as well as of leucine as a function of time is depicted in Figure 2. The N terminus sequence Met Asp Gln bGH is shown in Table IV. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the products reveals no detectable degradation of bGH analog. Leucine aminopeptidase porcine kidney, microsomal, Sigma L5006 , 1 mg ml suspension in 3.5 M NH₄ ₂ SO₄, 10 mM MgCl₂, pH 7.7, 100 microliters was mixed with 0.5M Tris HCl, pH 9.5, 25 microliters H₂O, 150 microliters, and 0.025 M MnCl₂, 25 microliters, and the mixture incubated at 37 C for 2h. Met hGH, was dissolved 11 mg ml in 10 mM NaBorate, pH 9.5. Control experiments were run by precipitating Met hGH with an equal volume of 3 sulfosalicylic acid after dissolution or after 22h of incubation at 37 C. The precipitated mixture was incubated for 15 min at 37 C, centrifuged, and 50 microliters of the supernatant taken for direct amino acid analysis. The results of the experiment are given in Table III. These results show that the leucine aminopeptidase does not remove the N terminal methionine and that the small amount of methionine released is likely due to the release from small peptides formed by contaminants of endopeptidase activity see amounts of Ile and Leu . This conclusion is confirmed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showing some degradation of the hormone by the enzyme after 22h incubation at 37 C. 2.5 ml Met Asp Gln bGH, 8mg ml in 10 m Na Borate pH 9.5, was incubated with 106 microliters enzyme, 0.4725 mg ml in 0.5 M Tris HCl, pH 9.5, 22h at 37 C. For the determination of the amino terminal sequence, 2 ml of the mixture were diluted 1 1 with 10 mM Na Borate, pH 9.5 and 1 ml 15 sulfosalicylic acid were added, the mixture incubated at 37 C for 15 min and precipitated by centrifugation. The pellet was resuspended in 5 ml 3 sulfosalicylic acid and recentrifuged. The pellet was suspended in 5 ml 10 mM Na Borate, pH 10.5 and dialyzed against three 2 liter changes of water containing 1 ml, 0.3 ml and 1 ml of concentrated ammonium hydroxide, respectively, and then was dialyzed against water. The sample was brought to 20 acetic acid by glacial acetic acid and used for sequence analysis. The results of the sequence analysis, shown in Table IV, demonstrate that more than 95 of the molecules have the N terminal sequence Asp Gln Phe Pro. The reactions carried out by the enzyme are reversible. Thus, removal of one of the products will tend to further drive the reaction to completion. We have demonstrated this by removing the liberated methionine residue during the course of the reaction, thus driving the reaction to further produce hGH. The liberated methionine residue was eliminated by ultrafiltration. Twelve grams of Met hGH in 1500 ml, 10 mM NaBorate, pH 9.5, was incubated with 12.4 ml of enzyme 0.4725 mg ml in 0.5 M Tris HCl, pH 9.5, at 37 C for 2h. An additional amount of 6.2 ml of the same enzyme solution was added and incubation at 37 C was continued for 3 1 2 h. The solution was placed for ultrafiltration and about 50 liters of 10 mM NaBorate, pH 9.5, were passed through the material during 4h to remove free methionine and drive the enzymatic reaction to completion. Incubation at 37 C was then continued for 12 1 2 h. Total duration of the incubation and ultrafiltration was 22h. The material was absorbed on DEAE Sephacel and the resin washed with 10 mM NaBorate, pH 9.0 and then with 10 mM NaBorate, pH 9.0 containing 25 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaCl and 75 mM NaCl. The hormone was eluted with 10 mM NaBorate, pH 9.0, containing 100 mM NaCl. The eluted hormone was concentrated, and dialyzed by ultrafiltration and lyophilized. A sample was dissolved in 20 acetic acid and subjected to sequence analysis. The results of analysis are shown in Table IV. The results demonstrate that in more than 99 of the molecules, the N terminal methionine was removed and there was no further degradation of the protein. Prior to reaction with Met Leu hGH, a sample of the aminopeptidase eluted from the DEAE Sephadex A 50 column was heated at 70 C and diluted as described in Example I. Met Leu hGH was dissolved to 8 mg ml by weight in 10 mM Na Borate buffer, pH 9.0. The pH was raised to 10.6, then dropped to 8.8, and finally the mixture was centrifuged to remove a small amount of precipitate. The supernatant solution was used for reaction. One thousand microliters of the Met Leu hGH solution and 21 microliters of the The N terminal sequence of Met hGH is shown in Table IV. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the products reveals no detectable degradation of the hGH. Thirty microliters of gamma interferon Amgen Interferon gamma 4A ARN 3010, batch 1 , containing the authentic sequence of the lymphokine and having a specific activity of 1 5 x 10⁷ units mg, was subjected to microsequence analysis. Analysis of the first three amino acids indicated that the material contains Met gamma Interferon with the N terminal sequence Met Gln Asp with some trace of Arg found in the third cycle . This gamma interferon derivative was acted upon by the The amount of methionine released was 96 picomoles and the background of other amino acids was fairly normal Asp, 15 picomoles Thr, 24 picomoles Ser, 3 picomoles Glu, 8 picomoles Gly, 53 picomoles Ala, 23 picomoles Val, 10 picomoles Leu, 8 picomoles and Phe, 11 picomoles there was another large contaminating peak, at the position where the enzyme reference also showed a peak. Relatively large background peaks of Ser and Gly were also seen on the gamma interferon reference. Assuming that the specific activity of the sample is 5x10⁷ units mg and mol wt. for gamma interferon of approximately 17,000, the amount of methionine released amounts to 73 of the theoretical value. If the specific activity of the material is lower than the above assured value, percentage of removal of Met could be lower. This experiment indicates that the N terminal methionine can be selectively and efficiently removed from Met gamma interferon by A recombinant interferon analog having a Met at its N terminus was processed according to the method of the present invention. Met was selectively removed from the N terminus of the molecule by the A recombinant somatomedin C polypeptide having a Met at its N terminus was processed according to the method of the present invention. Met was selectively removed from the N terminus of the molecule by the Met PGH lot 5 100 and Cu₂ Zn₂ human superoxide dismutase SOD lot 1 were prepared by recombinant techniques. The latter has the authentic N terminal sequence of the mature protein except that the N terminal Ala is not N Acetylated. There could be several reasons for the non stoichiometric removal of Met from Met PGH in contrast to the stoichiometric removal of Met from Met hGH . One explanation could be that the molecules could be present as non covalently associated dimers and that the N terminal methionine of only one of the molecules in the dimer is accessible to the enzyme attack, whereas the N terminal methionine of the other molecule in the dimer is sterically hindered. For this reason, only about 50 60 of the N terminal methionine residues were removed. Met hGh, on the other hand, is monomeric, Another possibility is that in Met pGH part of the molecules are still formylated and the enzyme does not remove formyl methionine. In order to prove any of these or other possibilities further experiments would be required. The amount of methionine, lysine and valine released agree with the theoretical amount expected, based on the specified concentration of the sample and assuming a molecular weight of approximately 35,000 for the protein i.e. 3.19 nmoles each . Yet, the removal of the third amino acid, Val is somewhat slower than the other amino acids. Within the first 1 hour of reaction no release of This example shows the removal of N terminal methionine from Methionyl bGH, where bGH is the phenylalanine form of bGH, having the N terminal sequence Met Phe Pro. One thousand microliters of the Met bGH solution and 56.3 microliters of the enzyme solution were incubated at 37 C and 75 microliter aliquots of the mixture were taken with time and precipitated with an equal volume of 3 sulfosalycilic acid. After incubation of the mixture at 37 C for 15 min. the precipitate was centrifuged and 50 microliters of the supernatant taken for direct amino acid analysis without acid hydrolysis . Control experiments were run by precipitating the hormone alone at time zero or after incubation at 37 C for 22 h and proceeding with the analyses as above. The results of the experiment are given in Table VIII. The experiment demonstrates that the reaction of The stoichiometry of the reaction is about 65 as opposed to stoichiometries of 90 100 which were observed for the reaction of the enzyme in several reactions with two different batches of Met hGH, with Met Asp Gln bGH and with Met Apolipoprotein E as well as with Met gamma interferon and Met somatomedin. On the other hand, reaction with Met Leu hGH and Met bGH showed only approximately 65 of Met released mole substrate and with Met pGH only approximately 50 60 . We have recently observed that with certain new batches of Met Asp Gln bGH the stoichiometry is also in the 50 60 range. We previously assumed that this partial stoichiometry would be due to either a not completely pure materials b incomplete removal of the N formyl group by the E. coli host deformylating enzyme s and or c to dimer formation of some hormones and accessibility of the enzyme to only one of the monomers in the dimer. We found indications for yet another likely explanation for the incomplete stoichiometry, namely, that the host E. coli processing enzyme system partially removes some of the N terminal methionine, e.g. in Met pGH and Met bGH, before purification of the proteins. The authentic recombinant hGH obtained from Met hGH by reaction with The experiments and results presented above clearly demonstrate that Additionally, the results of Example VI demonstrate that The most striking conclusion of the experiment of Example VI is that the amount of methionine and leucine released is the same, even after only two minutes of reaction. This is due to the fact that the leucine residue is probably being removed at a faster rate than the methionine residue. Thus, a recombinant DNA product of the design Met Leu hGH, where Met is followed by Leu, assures that the final product will be hGH with no detectable presence of Leu hGH molecules. This experiment demonstrates that the authentic molecule can be obtained not only from a methionyl derivative but also from a methionyl x derivative where x is another amino acid. Similarly, an authentic molecule would be obtained from x The enzymatic reaction is specific. In the two reactions examined, there are clear Asp and X Pro stops of the aminopeptidase that are in accord with the specificity of the enzyme towards small peptides. The reactions studied are quantitative. Confirmation of this conclusion was partly achieved by preliminary sequence analysis where at least 99 and 95 of the N terminal residues of the products of reaction of the aminopeptidase and the hormones were found to be Phe and Asp for the human and bovine growth hormone products, respectively. Confirmation of the quantitative aspect of the reaction is confronted with obvious handicaps of the sequencing method sensitivity, noise, by products and separation limits and the actual figures could be even higher than those given above. It should be noted in this regard that the enzymatic reaction Met Protein Met Protein is reversible and it could in principle be driven to synthesis by adding excess methionine or to complete hydrolysis by continuous removal of the amino acid. In one of the examples Example V demonstrating a batch preparation of hGH we have indeed employed ultrafiltration for several hours at a progressive stage of the reaction to remove free methionine and assist completion of the reaction. Removal of the aminopeptidase from the reacted hormone is achieved by selective absorption and desorption of the hormone to an anion exchange resin. Other alternative ways to remove the aminopeptidase after its reaction with the hormone could be the use of a water insoluble derivative of the enzyme in a batch or packed in a column as well as the use of an affinity resin for the enzyme to absorb it at the end of the reaction. The procedure used for Met hGH, Met Asp Gln bGH, Met Leu hGH, Met gamma interferon, Met somatomedin C, Met pGH, Met apolipoprotein E, and Met bGH should be applicable to other growth hormones and polypeptides. Methods for obtaining the aminopeptidase can be improved e.g. more economical process of isolation or genetically engineering the enzyme or developing microorganism overproducing aminopeptidase and endopeptidase free mutants of the microorganism . In addition to its action on growth hormones the aminopeptidase s can be useful for other recombinant DNA products such as hormones, growth factors, and enzymes that possess N terminal sequences in accordance with the specificity of the enzyme or enzymes, e.g. somatomedins interleukin 3, interferons, apolipoprotein E. Furthermore, the recombinant DNA products can be designed in a manner which would allow the removal of several amino acids from the N terminus, in addition to the methionine residue. For example derivatives like Met Lys bGH, Met Leu Tyr bGH and Met Phe Asp Gln bGH when acted upon by the aminopeptidase will yield hGH, bGH, bGH and Asp Gln bGH, respectively. It may be also possible to use the enzyme to add an amino acid by using excess of the amino acid in the incubation mixture, thus driving the synthesis reaction.
