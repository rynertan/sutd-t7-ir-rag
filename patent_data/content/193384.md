## Description
This invention relates generally to the automatic dispensing of articles, and in particular to the installation of electrical components such as connectors on printed circuit boards and, more particularly, to delivery of connectors to a location where they can be picked up by a robot and installed on a printed circuit board. Semiautomatic systems which dispense different connectors and indicate to an assembler where each is to be placed on a circuit board have been disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,222,166 and in U.S. Patent 4,250,615. With such systems, the assembler must handle each connector, place it at the correct location and install it. The different connectors are supplied in tubes, each of which must be replaced when empty. Thus, the dispensers disclosed in these patents cannot be used in any fully automated system for dispensing and installing electrical connectors. Another known dispenser, which discloses the preamble of claim 1, is described in DE A 2844169. Viewed from one aspect the invention provides an apparatus for dispensing articles from tubes secured to and arranged in spaced parallelism, each tube having a closure at each end for holding articles therein, said apparatus comprising a slide for receiving articles from an inclined tube, said slide extending downwardly to a pick up position, a stepping device for advancing successive tubes to said slide, and means for opening the closure at the lower end of each tube in its approach to the slide, characterised in that said apparatus comprises a stand provided with upper and lower support members, said slide extending downwardly from the lower support member, said stepping device advancing successive tubes over said support members to said slide, said opening means being provided on the lower support member, said support members having recessed, arcuate guide surfaces for the ends of said tubes and said lower support member having a slot therethrough for the passage of articles to said slide, and in that said tubes are arranged across a tape. Two embodiments of the present invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings in which An apparatus 10 for dispensing connectors is shown in Fig. 4 and a package 12 adapted for use with the apparatus 10 is shown in Figs. 1 3. The package 12 is an elongated belt having plural parallel plastic tubes 14 arranged transversely across a pair of tapes 16,17. Tapes 16,17 are strips or webs of an industrial fabric. Tubes 14 are equispaced and secured to the tapes with a hot melt plastic adhesive. Empty tubes 14 are shown in Figs. 1, 1A and 1B. They are U shaped in cross section and, at one end, have closures in the form of tabs 18 struck and bent inwardly from the outer wall of each tube. As shown in Figs. 2, 2A and 2B, the U shaped configuration adapts the tubes to carry plural articles such as connectors 20 having dual in line rows of contacts 22. A typical example is a horizontal card connector which is adapted to receive another connector having mating pins. After each tube is filled with connectors, its other end is closed with a piece 24 of paper tape. Referring now to Fig. 4, each elongated belt 12 is shipped in a cardboard carton 26 which, when opened, is placed on a shelf 28. Shelf 28 is pivotally mounted at 30 to a stand 32. Above shelf 28, there is a platform 34 which is pivotally mounted on stand 32 at 36. Shelf 28 and platform 34 are pivoted with respect to stand 32 by a handwheel 38 and a tie rod 40. Movement of carton 26 on the tilted shelf 28 is prevented by a flange 42. An end of belt 12 is trained over a spaced pair of sprocket wheels 43,44 which are fixed on a shaft 45. Shaft 45 is mounted in bearings on upper and lower support members 46,48 and is coupled to a stepping motor 50 provided with a control box 51. Motor 50 and the sprocket wheels 43,44 will be referred to herein as a stepping device. As shown in Figs. 4 6, support members 46,48 are recessed on their inner sides to provide arcuate guide surfaces 47,49 for the ends of tubes 14. As each tube 14 approaches the tops of support members 46,48, a slug of the paper tape 24 is removed by a cutting device 52. At the top of member 48, there is a slot 54 Fig. 6 through which connectors 20 pass to a slide 56. Presence of the first connector 20 on a pick up position defined by a stop plate 58 is detected by a first sensor 60. There is a second sensor 61 on slide 56 and a third sensor 62 on support member 48. The second and third connectors 20 are held in place by the actuating rods of air cylinders 63,64 until the first connector has been picked up by a robot. Cylinder 63 has a fixed mount 65 and cylinder 64 has a movable mount 66. Cylinders 63,64 will be referred to herein as an escapement. Movability of the mount 66 is shown in Figs. 4, 5 and 7 where it is seen that cylinder 64 is threaded into an aperture through a lateral extension from a T shaped plate 67. The end of the rod in cylinder 64 carries a cap 64 Referring now to Figs. 4 8, there is a vibrator 72 mounted on the bottom of slide 56. Vibrator 72 is attached to a fin 73 which depends from an elongated, T shaped element 74. Fin 73 projects through a slot 75 in the body of slide 56. A second slot 75 is shown in Figs. 5 and 8. As shown in Fig. 7, the base of the T shaped element 74 fits in channels at the bottom of a groove 76. A narrowed end of T shaped element 74 extends through slot 54 Fig. 6 and contacts the tube 14 then in the dispensing position. Movement of connectors from that tube and along the top of element 74 is assisted by the force of gravity and by the jiggling motion imparted by vibrator 72. Vibrator 72, cutting device 52 and the photodetectors are wired through a junction box 71 Fig. 4 . As shown in Figs. 6 8, sensors 60,61,62 have two elements. One element is a light source, the other a photodetector. These elements have been designated 60 Specific features of the cutting device 52 have been illustrated in Figs. 9 and 10. There are two blades 77 on a plunger 78 which is slidable in a housing 80 and is provided with an actuator, indicated by an arrow 81, for moving the blades through a paper tape 24. Fig. 10 shows how a cut slug 24 After a carton 26 has been placed on shelf 28, the operator must remove the tapes 24 from three of the tubes 14 as the end of the belt is moved up the arcuate guide surfaces 47,49 and fitted over sprocket wheels 43,44. At this time, the rod in cylinder 64 is extended and the rod in cylinder 63 is retracted. Connectors from the first tube 14 slide into engagement with the rod on cylinder 64. Then, the absence of a connector at the location of photodetector 60 is sensed, the positions of the rods in cylinders 63,64 are reversed and vibrator 72 is activated. When a connector reaches stop plate 58, photodetector 60 senses its presence there and the positions of the rods in cylinders 63,64 are again reversed. The vibrator 72 remains active until another connector reaches the extended rod of cylinder 63. The connector on the pick up position at the stop plate is then ready to be picked up by a robot which installs it on a circuit board or other component. Removal of the bottom connector on slide 56 is sensed by detector 60 and the cylinders 63,64 are again sequenced to release another connector. As noted above, movement of the connectors, when released, is assisted by the jiggling motion imparted by vibrator 72. When the absence of a connector is sensed by both of the photodetectors 61,62, the sensed signal activates the stepping motor 50 and another tube is indexed to the top position, with its opened end in line with slot 54 in support member 48. In the event of a jam in tube 14, i.e., a connector bridging the tube and the lower support member 48, the presence of a connector is sensed by photodetector 62. The sensed signal activates an alarm and inactivates the apparatus. As each tube reaches the location of cutting device 52, a slug 24 Instead of paper tapes 24, the ends of the tubes to be opened can be closed by polymeric pins of the type shown at 84 in Figs. 11 and 12. In a further modified closure the ends to be opened are closed by tabs 18 , as shown in Figs.14 18. A preferred modified dispensing apparatus according to the invention is shown in Figs. 13. 19, 20 and has been designated by the numeral 10 . Details of the tube opening device are shown in and will be described in connection with Figs. 14 18. Vibrator 72 is a VIBROLATOR ball type vibrator. Model No. CV 10 Martin Engineering Co., Neponset, IL . An end section 85 of slide 56 is pivotally mounted at 86 between a pair of plates 87 and the plates 87 are fixedly attached to the sides of slide 56 . End section 85 is moved between a position of alignment with slide 56 and a horizontal position by a piston cylinder assembly 88. As shown in Fig. 19. the pivoted end section 85 has a U shaped groove 89 defined by a central rail 90 which receives connectors 20 from slide 56 . Referring now to Fig. 20, it will be seen that vibrator 72 is fastened to a T shaped slide element 74 and that this assembly is normally biased by a spring 91 to a position where the upper end of slide 74 engages a tube 14 . When a tube has been emptied. the upper end of slide 74 is moved away from the path of the tubes over the guiding surface on support member 48 by an air cylinder 94 for the purpose of avoiding a jam between slide 74 and the next tube 14 . The operation of this preferred embodiment is the same as for the apparatus shown in Figs. 4 and 5 except for the pivoted end section 85, a different tube opening device 52 and the provision of spring 91, air cylinder 94 and a sturdier vibrator 72 . When the presence of a connector 20 is sensed by detector 60 , end section 85 is moved to its horizontal position to facilitate pick up by a robot. As soon as the connector at the end of section 85 has been picked up and before release of the next connector by the air cylinder 63 , section 85 is returned to its position of alignment with slide 56 . Referring now to Figs. 14 18, the end of each tube 14 to be opened by device 52 is closed by tabs 18 struck and bent inwardly from the outer wall. Device 52 has a plunger 78 which is slidable in a housing 80 and is provided with an actuator, indicated by an arrow 81 , for moving the plunger into the end of tube 14 . Plunger 78 has a tip 92 which is T shaped in cross section Fig. 14 . Tip 92 has a base which is rounded across its bottom and a tapered leg 93 which is rounded at its top. Leg 93 has its leading and trailing edges disposed at angles of about 45 . The base fits easily into a tube 14 where its leading edge engages the outer wall Fig. 16 of the tube and the tabs 18 Fig. 17 which are bent outwardly from the wall of the tube. When tip 92 is withdrawn, tabs 18 are held in an interference fit Fig. 18 and tube 14 is open for the discharge of connectors 20 when it reaches the slot at the top of lower support member 48 Fig. 13 . Because of the angularly disposed leading and trailing edges and the rounded top of leg 93, the upper wall of the tube is deformed but does not tear as tip 92 is inserted and withdrawn.
