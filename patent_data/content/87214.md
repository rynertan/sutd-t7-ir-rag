# On column capillary gas chromatographic injector.

## Abstract
Apparatus 10 and method for injection of samples directly onto a column 21 in a gas chromatograph with injection occurring in a temperature controlled zone outside the oven. The apparatus 10 combines a guide means and valve assembly 5 in alignment with an injection and thermal transfer assembly 6 . In the guide means and valve assembly 5 a radial seal 12 engages the injection means to seal the injection volume, thereby eliminating back flash. In the injection and thermal transfer assembly 6 the capillary column 21 is centered and held in fixed position within a duct means 20 . Means 24, 31, 32, 30 is provided to lower the temperature of the capillary column 21 to a temperature below the vaporization temperature of the liquid sample prior to injection. After injection means is further provided to raise the temperature of the capillary column to a tempera ture above the volatilization temperature of the liquid sample to vaporize it and pass it into the capillary column. The method of on column injection of the present invention comprises inserting an injection means through a radial seal means 12 to a point just above a valve 15 , opening the valve 15 , further inserting the injection means through the valve and into the end of that portion of the capillary column within the thermal transfer assembly and outside the oven of the gas chromatograph, injecting a liquid sample into the end of the capillary column 21 while maintaining the column at temperature below the vaporiza tion temperature of said liquid sample, withdrawing the injection means from the capillary column 21 and the valve means 15 , closing the valve means 15 , withdrawing the injection means through the injector duct 13 and the radial seal means 12 , and heating said column 21 within said temperature controlled zone to volatilize said sample and pass it into said column 21 .
