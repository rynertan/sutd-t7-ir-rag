## Description
Three Level Distributed Control for Networking I ODevices.FIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to local area network systems in which simultaneous voice, data and video communication between an initiating and recipient device located within the same or distinct nodes is accomplished. Since any such system must have the capability for connecting any station with another station within the entire coverage area of the network, a great deal of complexity can be rapidly built into the system in order to provide such full service coverage.Utilizing digital processing techniques and available logical processor capabilities, it is possible to accomodate the demands of such networking to a great extent. Efficient utilization of even a processor based networking system requires the efficient interplay of 1 a directory function to identify, from an enormous repertory of subscriber addresses, a desired address for an identified recipient device from any initiating device 2 the processing of that information to establish and maintain the communication link between the initiating and recipient devices and 3 the function of information exchange for a large number of simultaneous exchanges. These substantial demands can and have been met in the past by expensive arrays of processing capability utilizing in some cases multiple processors and shared processing capacity.BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In accordance with the teaching of the present invention the processing functions required for establishing and maintaining a high level of voice, video and data communications between originating and recipient devices distributed over a communication net work of multiple nodes is accomplished by distributing the processing function within each node between three levels of processing capability. A first level processor on the highest level provides initial processing on an interrupt basis of a request for communication from any originating I O device within the node and rapidly accesses, at character transmission rates, routing information for the desired recipient device, while monitoring call progress until a connection is made. The high level processor then drops out.The routing information is in turn passed on to a second level processor system associated on a data bus with a cluster of devices, one of which is the originating device of the communication request. The routing information received at the second processor level from the directory in the top level processor is utilized at the second processor level to format both information and addressing data into queues and data registers, where they are available for extraction by a third level processor which acts on the routing information to distribute the data packet in according with that routing information either back to another cluster of communication devices within the same node or out over a network coupler, typically a passive star optical fiber network, to other nodes for distribution to the addressed recipient there. The division of communication responsibility in this manner greatly improves the efficiency of each local area network node. The directory function for generating routing information for a desired communication between any two or more devices is centralized in a single processor at the highest level and the demands upon its time are minimized by passing control from it to the second and third level processors as soon as the routing information is established and a connection between devices made. Directory updating is also simpli fied by the need to access modify information in only one data base. The actual control over communication between devices is then distributed between a number of small processors, typically inexpensive microprocessors, which efficientlymaintain a large number of communications simultaneously.The substantially largest task of routing voices, video or data signals for transmission or receipt by individual devices is accomplished at the middle level of distributed processors, utilizing efficient high density, high speed burst transmission of data packets. The communication routing external of a node is made by the third level processor through communication logic utilizing a priority scheme which occupies the real time communication ability of the linkage through a passive star or other mechanism to other nodes on a 100 message density basis along a message link. This high density is achieved by using a separate control link between nodes over which a repeating time frame is cut into segments occupied by requests for transmission from each node. Alternating with the request subframe is a subframe of grants, one corresponding to each of the nodes in the network. In each grant, a corresponding node transmits its determination of the next node to transmit according to the same algorithm which is basE upon the node having the highest priority message and longest wait.All grants should be identical, which serves as an error check, and the identified node is then operative to transmit communication information over the message link during the subsequent frame. The process keeps repeating, allowing the node with the highest priority and longest wait to be the next to go. Because of the need for real time communication for voice and video signals, the priority algorithm assigns to those the highest priority, handling all requests for such communication first. The three level hierarchy and distribution of communication functions between them minimizes the amount of burst transfers required within a node to a maximum of two to accomplish any information transfer function and a maximum of four transfers where more than one node is involved. Similarly, the separate control link insures that the message link will be completely full of information at all times as long as information is waiting, thereby allowing maximum communication rate between nodes.DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING These and other features of the present invention are more fully sent forth below in the solely exemplary detailed description and accompanying drawing of which Fig. 1 is a generalized block diagram of a local area network illustrating the distribution within a single node of processing functions between three levels of processors Fig. 2 is a detailed block diagram illustrating the component structure of a single node for use within the Fig. 1 architecture Fig. 3 is a detailed circuit diagram of a portion of the circuit node of Fig. 2 comprising the data handling capability for voice or digital signal transfer between second and third level processing functions Figs. 4A, 4B and 4C are respectively a diagram illustrating network architecture, address formatting, and a device address directory Fig. 5 is a timing diagram illustrating the operation and timing of the priority switching of communication between nodes over a coupling network Fig. 6 is an algorithm illustrating the operation of a node according to Fig. 2 for establish ing a communication link and for generating communication data for exchange between devices within the same or different nodes and Fig. 7 is a processing algorithm illustrating the operation of the third level node in a priority transmission scheme with other nodes associated through a single coupling network to identify the next node to transmit over the network.DETAILED DESCRIPTION The present invention contemplates a local area networking system as illustrated in Fig. 1 in which a plurality of nodes 12 are interconnected through a communication network 14 typically comprising a fiber optic communication path coupled through a passive star 16. A typical network or local area network is illustrated in Fig. 4A. As shown there, devices are associated with nodes through which they may communicate to each other without their signals ever leaving the node.A subnetwork is formed by coupling together several nodes through a coupling device C. In the case of the present invention, a preferred coupler utilizes optical fiber interconnecting mechanisms. One or more devices within a node may comprise porting mechanisms that communicate with other similar devices in a node or nodes of other subnetworks. By allowing communication between such devices in different subnetworks, the subnetworks can be associated together to form networks, or local area networks. Fig. 4B illustrates an addressing scheme utilized in the present invention to identify within a group of networks, a particular device. The scheme of Fig. 4B devotes 32 bits to the particular device address, allotting 8 bits to denote the network, 8 bits to the subnetwork, 8 bits to the node, and 8 bits to the device within the node. A very large number of devices can be uniquely identified by such a format. Within a single node 12 the communication function is distributed between three levels. The first level comprises a computer and associated memory and secondary storage operating with the system software identified in Table I as the main system routing. It comprises the most intelligent processor 18. The processor 18 maintains in secondary storage a directory of identification and routing directions for all devices within its node 12. Device addresses for other nodes 12 are accessed through the local area network as discussed below. The devices, representing the I O capability of individual subscribers, are typically clustered in 64 groups 20 comprising typically four individual devices such as telephone sets, data terminals, video systems, computers, etc. and have associated therewith a second level microprocessor.A request to establish communications, such as an of hook indication plus a dialed number, is established as an interrupt to the main computer system 18. The dialed number is utilized by the highest level processor 18 to access a directory of addresses for the devices within that processor s node.An exemplary directory is illustrated in Fig. 4C. As shown there, the directory consists of a series of storage addresses corresponding to the number of the requested device generated by the requesting device.Correlated with each address is a set of routing codes for the requested device, if it exists within the same node, along with a set of binary bits which the processor controls to indicate the status of the requested or addressed device. These bits include bits to indicate a busy or Off Hook status for the device, the status of that device receiving a ring signal, and the condition for that device being interconnected with another device. If the directory of the local processor 18 for the requesting device does not contain such an entry for the requested device, it indicates that the requested device is not present within that local node.As described below, the processor 18 then composes a message for transmission to other nodes seeking the node having the requested device. When the requested device is located, the processor associated with the node of the requested device detects its status. If that status indicates a busy condition, the requesting device is so signalled by its local processor 18. Otherwise the requested device is caused to ring and its subsequent Off Hook status institutes communication between the devices in a data block transfer mode. The communication prior to this point had occurred at character rate, insuring optimum speed in the communication and minimizing the amount of time that the attention of the highest level processor must be diverted to handling the communication initiating function.The conversion to block rate occurs after the processor 18 receives from its storage or the storage of the processor 18 in a remote node the routing instructions from the directory of Fig. 4C for communicat ion to the requested device along with an indication of Off Hook for both devices. This information is provided to the processor s associated with the requesting device in one of the clusters 20. The requested device processor receives the complementary routing data for the requesting device. At this point the high level processor s 18 drops out of the communication function for information exchange between the requesting and recipient devices, all subsequent processing being handled by level two and three processors. The micropressor s associated at level 2 with the requesting and requested devices in the corresponding cluster s 20 formats information for transmission between the devices as a combination of information signals that are block transferred betweenFIFO queues 23 over a data bus 22. Source and destination queues 23 are identified over a control bus 21 from routing provided by a processor 18. A control bus 25 serviced by a third level microprocessor 26 sets source and destination controls for block transfer between queues 23 over a send data bus 24. If the routing is to a device within the node, the source and destination control set up over bus 25 will execute block transfer between queues 23. If the requested device is outside the node, routing will be between queues 23 and a queue 27 used for block transfer over the coupler link 14. In this manner, the processing function for handling all of the information assemblage and interfacing with the individual devices occurs with a set of distributed processors grouped in clusters 20 at the second level. The actual information exchange is then simplified for routing by the processor 26 in the most efficient manner. The details of an individual node 12 illustrated in Fig. 1 are shown with respect to Fig. 2 identifying individual component elements responsible for accomplishing the networking function. The system illustrated in Fig. 2 shows the main system routing processor 18 to include a central processor unit 40, which may be a 32 bit microprocessor, programmed in accord with the Table I CLanguage Coding, associated over a high speed data bus 42 with an internal RAM memory 44 and mass storage memories 46 and 48 in the form of hard disks and floppy disks associated with the bus 42 through a conventional disk controller 50. A data bus 52, typically a one mega byte input output bus, communicates with the CPU 40 on the one hand to exchange data at a character rate with individual clusters 20. In the case of data exchange with digital devices, character buffers 54 provide buffering for the access rights on handshaking routines to set up communication. For voice, they provide tone to ASCII conversion. Each cluster 20 is illustrated to comprise an interface or control bus 56 associated with a microcontroller 58. The bus 56 communicates with a plurality of devices such as a set of four data terminals 60 illustrated in one cluster 20 or a set of four conventional telephone sets 62 illustrated in a second one of the clusters 20. Typically each of the telephone sets 62 is coupled for message transfer to a data bus 55 through an interface circuit 64 and FIFO queue 53 described below with respect to Fig. 3. The digital terminals are connected through a digital interface 61 and FIFO queue 53 to the data bus 55 associated with its microcontroller 58. Other interfacing functions and components such as an interfacing system 66 using onebr more types of interfacing logic such as that corresponding to the RS232 interfacer for operation with other data equipment or a further network may be associated with the data and control buses 56, 55 of yet another cluster 20. Associated with each control bus 56 of the clusters 20 is a header register 70 connected between the bus 52 and control bus 56 to contain routing data set there by CPU 40 appropriate to each device communication being established, or ongoing. The data in this register is accessed by the level two controller 58 to set up source and destination codes in registers 79 that control the transfer of data between the queues on bus 55.A status register 74 functions to hold a request for communication for each device in a cluster 20. The CPU 40 scans these registers to identify interrupting devices requesting service. A set of control registers 72 are associated with each device 60, 62 and are set by theCPU 40 to cause a particular device to receive and indicate a dial tone, busy signal or ring back, and to identify to that device whether it is in a character or burst data mode. The main routing computer system 18 may be addressed on its bus 42 directly through a cluster comprising a microcontroller 76, data and control buses 55, 56, destination register 77 and buffer storage 78 associated with control bus 56 along with queues 80.Such a connection may be utilized, for example, for electronic or voice mail or mass data transfer to and from the records, such as disks 46 and 48, of the central computer system 18. It functions substantially the same as the other level two systems. The control buses 56 set source and destination registers 79 that control communication through a set of queuing registers 80, according to data in header registers 70. A second set of header registers 81 are associated with a microcontroller 84 to define the third level of communication processing. The header registers 81 store the data in registers 70. The controller 84 uses the data in the header registers, identifying routing, to set source and destination codes in registers 85 over a control bus 82. At any instant of time these control the flow of data between the queues 80 and 86 on a data bus 83.Separate queuing registers 86 typically provided as four sets of registers, one for each of video, voice, data or control information channels, assemble data which is to be or has been transformed by an optical transmitter receiver pair 88 for two way optical communication over the respective optical fiber cables 90 to a corresponding fiber optic coupler, such as a passive star coupler. The transmitter receiver pairs 88 are controlled by control logic 89 over buses 91. All processors 58, 84 and 89 may be model 8X305, 8X310 processors with associated RAM ROM memory to contain their programming as shown in micro code in Table II. System speed typically increases with each downward level in order to accommodate the increasing information density. It is thus preferably that logic 89 be hard wired to provide simultaneous control of step execution specified in Fig. 7. Fig. 3 illustrates circuit details of clusters 20 and the queues 80 and 86, along with one of four transmitter receiver pairs 88 and logic 89 and buses 91. In the case where the subscriber device comprises a telephone hand set 100 a filter network 102 provides bandpass matching of the telephone voice signal for application through a logarithmic analog to digital converter 104 or for transient filtering of the switching transients in the digitalto analog conversion of a digital to analog converter 106.Converter 104 AMD AM 7901 is selectively controlled by CPU 40 for log or linear operation. The output from the analog to digital converter 104 is applied to a set of queues 108 and 110. While one queue is accumulating a package of digital data for burst transmission, the adjacent queues 110 is transmitting the previously accumulated digital packet as a data burst. Each queue 108, 110 provides an output signal indicating its need for emptying as an interrupt signal. The associated microcontroller 58 receives both routing data from the header register 70 and the interrupts and sets control codes into source and destination registers 109 and 111 on control bus 56 to define the order of data flow in bursts from ones of the queues 108, 110 associated with each of the devices through data bus 55. The information is processed on the most urgent basis i.e.FIFO and is applied to the data bus 55 so that it will be picked up by a complementary set of data queues 112 and 114 coupling the data bus 55 to the data bus 83, associated with the third level microcontroller 84. In the event information is destined for a device in the same cluster 20, queues 134 and 136 will receive the bursts. In a similar manner, the microcÏntroller 84 will respond to data in header register 81 defining routing outside the node and interrupts from queues 112 and 114 defining timing to set source and destination registers 113 and 115 to control the flow of burst of data from one of the queues 112 or 114 through data bus 83 to ones of four sets of output queues 116 or 118. If data is destined to a device within the node, one of queues 130, 132 leading to bus 55 of another cluster is used. Data thus processed by the microcontroller 84, is assembled from the queues as data packages and applied into the data queues 116 and 118. Control logic 89 applies the data in the queues 116 and 118 to an optical transmitter system 120. Logic 89 accesses a header register 119 on control bus 91 to include addressing information in the data burst of queues 116, 118. Transmitter 120 converts the electrical signals into optical modulation for coupling into an optical fiber 122 and thence over the optical coupler system 14.The only difference is that header information is now transmitted as part of the outgoing data. The system of queues 116 and 118 is repeated for each of the communication channels utilized for voice, video, data and control purposes described above with respect to Fig. 2.The control channel is shown in Fig. 3 with all elements primed. Data is received as optical signals on a fiber 121 and is converted to electrical counterparts by an optical receiver 124 and applied, under control of registers 113 and 115 set by processor 84, through a complementary set of queues 126 and 128 using the same data routing techniques in the reverse direction.The queues 126 and 128 provide data to the bus 83 where the source and destination registers 113 and 115 set by the controller 84 control the routing into one of the cluster 20 queue sets 130 and 132 used to block transfer data from the bus 83 to bus 55. In similar fashion, the source and destination registers 109 and 111 set by the microcontroller 58 at the second level route information in the queues 130, 132, through the bus 55, to the appropriate ones of the queues 134 and 136 that directly apply information to the ultimate subscriber device. In the case where the originating or recipient device is a digital terminal 140 rather than a voice terminal, a similar set of queues 108, 110, 134, and 136 are utilized for communication through the data bus 55 associated with the cluster microcontroller 58 and associated source and destination registers 109 and Thl controlling that flow of data communication. The transmission system from the data bus 83 through the system of queues 116, 118, and optical transmitter system 120 is governed by a priority scheme operative within the microcontroller 84 and logic 89, and described with respect to the algorithm of Fig. 7, utilizing the time framing illustrated in Fig. 5. As shown there, a timing diagram 150 is broken into a series of time frames 152 for the transmission, by one of the nodes 12 in the system, of a message packet. The determination of which node will transmit for each time frame 152 is determined by transmission over a control link as illustrated by the primed numbers in Fig. 3.The time frame 152 on the control link is divided into a set of time slots or bit groups 154 each associated with one of the nodes 12 followed by set of time slots 156, also each associated with one of the nodes.During the time slots 154, each node transmits in its associated time slot only a request for transmission comprising the identity of the type of information awaiting transmission if any. Each of the nodes receives this information as distributed throughout the network 14 and makes a determination according to an identical priority algorithm as to which station should transmit information in the next occurring information time frame 152. That determination is made upon the basis of the node having the longest interval from its last opportunity to transmit. The identity of the node to transmit is then communicated by each node in its corresponding time slot 156 as a grant of communication authority to that node.If all grants are identical, indicating each node is processing information according to the same priority scheme accurately, in the next subsequent time frame 152 the identified node will automatically transmit a data burst through its queuing system during the entire time slot 152. In this manner as long as there is a node awaiting to transmit information, the entire time available for transmission on the message links will be fully utilized. Typically, the priority scheme will give priority to voice and video communications because of its real time requirements,handling digital information exchange after all awaiting voice communications have been handled. The main computer 18, according to the programming as exemplified by Table 1, keeps track of the numbers of voice, data, etc. communications going on simultaneously and has a maximum number of voice communications which the node will handle simultaneously before overloading the transmission system so that a voice communication has to wait an unacceptably long period of time, thereby creating a perceived communication delay between the users. This information is contained within the system program. With a request for communication when the maximum number of voice channels has been reached, control register 72 will cause the requesting devices to be placed in a busy signal condition. These and other functions of the CPU 40 are accomplished by the Table I programming. Fig. 6 is an algorithmic representation of that programming as it affects system operation according to the present invention. As shown therein, the initial response by the system to a requesting or initiating device going Off Hook is detection of that by the CPU 40 in a step 160 by interrupt and checking the status registers 74. Off Hook status causes CPU 40 to set a dial tone bit in control register 72 for the requesting device. The CPU also receives the number of the requested or recipient device generated by the requesting device. CPU 40 makes a decision in a subsequent step 161 by accessing the directory for all devices in its node as recorded in mass storage.If the device requested is within the node, processing branches to a decision step 162 in which theCPU 40 checks the status bits in the directory for the requested device. If the status bits indicate that the requested device is busy, the control register 72 for the requesting device is set to generate a busy tone in that device in a step 163. If the requested device is not busy, processing proceeds to a step 162 in which the CPU 40 places in the control registers 72 for the requested and requesting devices states which generate a ring and ring tone respectively. At this point the CPU 40 may also load the header register for the requesting device with routing data from the directory for the requested device although this may also be accomplished after the requested device is detected in the Off Hook status.In step 164 the CPU 40 sets the ring bits in the directory status registers for both requesting and requested devices. In subsequent step 165, the CPU 40 detects the Off Hook status of the requested device with the ring bit set. The header register 70 associated with the requested device and the control register 72 for both are loaded with control data causing each controller 58 to proceed to execute block or burst transfer between queues. the CPU 40 then sets the connect bits in the directories for the two or more devices and drops out of operation. In a subsequent step 166, the messages generated and received by the requesting and requested devices flow through the level two and three queues under control of the source and destination registers set by the controllers 58 and 84 in response to queue status interrupts and header register addressing data set byCPU 40. If the talking devices are entirely within a single cluster 20, the header register addresses will result in source and destination register control that keep data flowing between the queues over a single bus 55 within that cluster. The step 166 processing continues until the CPU 40 detects in the status register 74 on OnHook condition for one of the communicating devices in a step 167. The CPU 40 then resets the directory status bits for that device to an inactive status and proceeds to a step 174 to do accounting for the communi ca ion. If decision step 161 indicated that the requested device was not in that node, processing proceeds to a step 168 in which the CPU 40 forwards a message, through the path governed by controller 76 for transmission to other nodes. That message identifies the originating node and requested device. All nodes respond to that message to search their directory for the requested device. The node which has the requested device within its directory and thus physically located within the node, checks the device status bits in the directory for a busy indication. If the device is busy it transmits such an indication, otherwise it transmits out over the subnetwork or network an indication of the routing to that device from its directory.The distant node then sets the ring bit in the directory and control register 72 for the requested device and transmits back a message, picked up by the originating node indicating a ringing state at the requested device in step 169.The originating CPU 40 sets the ring tone in the control register for the requesting device. When the requested device goes OffHook,the CPU 40 of the distant node detects that state via interrupts and the status registers 74. Detection of the Off Hook condition, with the ring bit set in step 170, causes transmission of an indication of that event over the network by the distant nodeCPU 40. Subsequently, in step 171 the distant node CPU 40, and the originating node CPU 40 in response to reception of the Off Hook message, both set the connect bits in the directories. At this point, or earlier, the header registers for both requesting and requested devices are set with routing information so that the block or burst transfer through the queues can proceed as noted above. The cluster controllers 58 are put into the block transfer mode initiating that form of information exchange between the devices. Subsequent step 172 corresponds to the normal communication state of step 166.One either device goes On Hook, the local CPU 40 initiates the termination procedures of step 167, in step 173. Thereafter the processing proceeds to the accounting step 174. The prioritizing scheme illustrated with respect to the timing diagram of Fig. 5 operates in accordance with the programmed algorithm of Fig. 7 within the controller 84 and logic 89. The algorithm of Fig. 7 implements the following data conventions A message packet frame is defined to include a header or burst having 4 bytes destination subframe and 4 bytes source subframe Where a dest source subframe is Fig. 4B 1 byte device id 1 byte Node id 1 byte Subnet id 1 byte Net id 1 byte type of message or command char. 1 byte size of transfer information consisting of x bytes data and a trailer having 2 bytes Cyclic Redundancy check digits CRC 16 At wakeup or power up each Node is in an alexic state. It is one of the functions of initialization step 179 to place a unit into a normal state giving theNode its identity.By design embedded in the hardware, each Node, or a minimum of 3 Nodes in a Subnet, will turn on with the ability as a minimum to read from the memory of its CPU its physical id and its profile characteristics. This permits utilization of a priority interaction between nodes. At Startup each node reads its physical id and sets a watchdog timer to a value based on its physical id. id inset timer to O id 2 set time to .1 sec Using the transmit clock id 3 set time to .2 sec id 20 set timer to 1.9 sec As the time counts down, a health message is transmitted by each node at time O on the message fiber link. The time intervals for each node are extracted from the message fiber link by each of the node s message receiver circuits and is used to define the timing for the control fiber link as shown in Fig. 5. This clock and a counter is used to partition allocate a slot the transmit and receive time for each of the nodes on the control fiber. As each node receives a message on the message fiber link it resets the watchdog timer to its initial value.This allows for robust system action i.e., no single point failure mechanism. The priority scheme after initialization starts from a state 180 and proceeds to a step 182 in which the node granted transmission authority transmits its message during the subsequent time frame 152. Each microcontroller 89 in each node also executes a step 184 in which, in the particular one of the time slots 154 assigned to that node, it transmits a request or not for transmission. Using the recovered clock from the message fiber link each node counts modulo 3, using their number of modulo 3 compared to its physical id as the time slot for that node to make a message bus request i.e. id starts out followed by d 2, id 3, etc. till the 20th time slot is noted.This provides 3 bit times for each node hence time 60 bits for all nodes to make or not make a message but request for the next message frame . Each time slot 3 bits for the 1st 60bit period is defined as follows bit 1 Binary 1 for request for message link Binary 0 for no request absence of pulse if bit 1 Binary 1 then bit 2 Binary 1 message request voice Binary 0 message request data if bit 2 Binary 0 then bit 3 Binary 1 character transfer Binary 0 block transfer In a subsequent step 186 each node microcontroller 84 receives the request from all the other nodes as applied on the control cable 90 of the network connector and calculates according to the same priority scheme the identity of the node next to transmit.The priority algorithm for granting a node s message request proceeds according to the following rules a At any instance of time a voice or video real time request has higher priority than a data request b Two or more nodes requesting voice message transmission at the same time, the lower physical id node is granted. c Outstanding voice requests are honored as longest waiting first. d Data requests are honored after all voice or video requests have been granted. If all nodes are operating correctly this identity will be the same from each case. In a subsequent step 188, each node transmits the identity of the node determined to be the next to transmit in the assigned one of the time slots 156 as a grant of authority. Each node in a step 190 responds to the grants of authority to determine that all nodes are granting the same node the authority to transmit in the next message frame 152 and, if the identity is the same, processing returns in a step 192 to state A with, in step 182, the granted node transmitting its message, and the request and grant sequence repeating. A failure operation 194 can be provided if the determination in step 190 is that one or less than a majority as an option of the nodes fails to identify the same node as granted authority.In this case, on the basis of an indication of a system error, the system can revert to a more conventional form of time shared communication or otherwise to avoid the problem of having two nodes from an erroneous grant attempt to transmit a message in the same frame 152. Exemplary components for implementing the system include TRW 1030 units for all queue registers, signetics 8X320units for the header registers, a MotorolaVME BUS for bus 42, a Motorola I O channel for bus 52, 7400 series registers for the control, status, source and destination registers and character buffers, a Z8030 with a M68008 controller for the digital terminal interfacing. Other components have been noted in the text where important. The optical transmitter and receiver are conventional and have a clock recovery phase locked loop as known in the art. The four fiber optic links may be combined into one coupler using wavelength division multiplexing if desired. The registers are preferably operated in a memory mapped mode as is known in the art. The above system provides a local area networking function in which a highly efficient division of system control is achieved between three levels of processor control and further in which message density is maintained at 100 . It will occur to others that improvements and modifications can be made within the scope of the invention as defined solely in the following claims.
