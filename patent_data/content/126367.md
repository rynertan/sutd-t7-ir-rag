## Description
The present invention relates to novel chromans and chromenes having pharmacological activity, to a process for preparing them, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them, and to their use in the treatment of mammals. US A 4 110 347 and 4 119 643 and 4 251 537 and EP A 28 064 and EP A 28 449 disclose classes of chromans that are described as having blood pressure lowering activity or anti hypertensive activity. European Patent Publications EP A 76 075, EP A 95 316, EP A 35868, EP A 28 065, EP A 46 652 and EP A 93 535 disclose further classses of chromans that are substituted in the 4 position. Such chromans are also described as having blood pressure lowering activity. A further class of chromans, and their corresponding chromenes, has now been discovered which are characterised by the presence of an ureido, thioureido or esterified carboxyamino or thiocarboxyamino group that substitutes the chroman or chromene in the 4 position. In addition, such chromans and chromenes have been found to have blood pressure lowering activity. Accordingly, the present invention provides a compound of formula I wherein When one of R₁ and R₂ is hydrogen, the other is preferably selected from the class of C₁ ₆ alkylcarbonyl, C₁ ₆ alkoxycarbonyl, nitro or cyano. In particular, when one of R₁ and R₂ is hydrogen, the other is preferably nitro, cyano or acetyl. When one of R₁ and R₂ is hydrogen, it is preferred that R₂ is hydrogen. When one of R₁ and R₂ is nitro, cyano or C₁ ₃ alkylcarbonyl, and the other is methoxy or amino optionally substituted as hereinbefore defined, the other is preferably amino optionally substituted by one or two C₁ ₆ alkyl groups or by C₂ ₇ alkanoyl. In particular, when one of R₁ and R₂ is nitro, cyano or C₁ ₃ alkylcarbonyl, the other is amino, methylamino, dimethylamino or acetylamino. Most preferably, one of R₁ and R₂ is nitro or cyano, especially cyano, and the other is amino. When one of R₁ and R₂ is nitro, cyano or C₁ ₃ alkylcarbonyl, it is preferred that R₁ is nitro or cyano or C₁ ₃ alkylcarbonyl, such as acetyl. The alkyl groups or alkyl moieties of alkyl containing groups for R₁ or R₂ are, preferably, methyl or ethyl. Preferably, R₃ and R₄ are both C₁ ₄ alkyl. In particular, they are both methyl or ethyl, preferably both methyl. When R₅ is C₁ ₆ alkoxy and R₆ is hydrogen, preferred examples of R₅ include methoxy and ethoxy, of which methoxy is more preferred. When R₅ is C₁ ₇ acyloxy and R₆ is hydrogen, a preferred class of R₅ is unsubstituted carboxylic acyloxy, such as unsubstituted aliphatic acyloxy. However, it is preferred that R₅ and R₆ together are a bond, or, in particular, that R₅ is hydroxy and R₆ is hydrogen. Examples of R₇ include the following groups Methoxy, ethoxy, n and iso propoxy, and phenoxy optionally substituted by one methyl, ethyl, methoxy, ethoxy, chloro or bromo group or atom, preferably methoxy, ethoxy, and phenoxy optionally substituted by one methyl, methoxy or chloro group or atom, in particular ethoxy X is preferably oxygen in this case. Examples of R₈ include hydrogen, methyl, ethyl, Examples of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of a compound of formula I , when the compound of formula I contains a salifiable group which is an optionally substituted amino group, include acid addition salts such as the hydrochloride and hydrobromide salts. Such a group may be an R₁ or R₂ group or be within an R₇ group. Preferably, a compound of formula I is in substantially pure form. The compounds of formula I wherein R₅ is hydrogen, hydroxy, C₁ ₆ alkoxy or C₁ ₇ acyloxy and R₆ is hydrogen have a least one asymmetric centre and, therefore, can exist as enantiomers. The present invention extends to all such isomers individually and as racemates. Examples of compounds of formula I include the compounds prepared in the Examples hereinafter. A group of compounds of formula I is those wherein R₇ is amino optionally substituted by a C₁ ₆ alkyl group, or by a phenyl group optionally substituted by C₁ ₆ alkyl, C₁ ₆ alkoxy or halogen. A second group of compounds of formula I is those wherein R₇ is C₁ ₆ alkoxy, or phenoxy optionally substituted by C₁ ₆ alkyl, C₁ ₆ alkoxy or halogen. The present invention also provides a process for preparing a compound of formula I , which comprises acylating a compound of formula II wherein R₁ and R₂ are R₁ and R₂, as defined hereinbefore, or a group or atom convertible thereto, R₃, R₄ and R₈ are as defined hereinbefore, R₅ is hydrogen, hydroxy, C₁ ₆ alkoxy or C₁ ₇ acyloxy and R₆ is hydrogen, the R₈NH group being In the process, when R₁₁ in a compound of formula IV is C₁ ₆ alkyl or phenyl optionally substituted as hereinbefore defined, the reaction between the compounds of formulae II and IV is, preferably, carried out in a solvent, such as methylene chloride, at below room temperature, in particular below 10 When R₁₁ is hydrogen, the reaction between the compounds of formulae II and IV is, preferably, carried out using a corresponding alkali metal cyanate or thiocyanate, for example that of sodium or potassium, in an aqueous medium optionally methanolic acidified with a mineral acid, such as dilute hydrochloric acid. A slightly elevated temperature such as 50 to 90 Conversions of an aromatic group into R₁ or R₂, as defined hereinbefore, are generally known in the art of aromatic chemistry. For example, it is preferred when carrying out the acylation of a compound of formula II , first to protect any unsubstituted amino group, that may be present for R₁ or R₂, and afterwards to convert the protected amino moiety into the required amino group. Examples of protecting agents include acyl groups, such as acetyl, which may be added and removed conventionally. If it is desired to protect an amino moiety in the presence of a cyano group then a more appropriate method is to use a trifluoroacetyl protecting group which may be removed by mild hydrolysis or to use a benzyloxycarbonyl or a p nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl protecting group which may be removed by mild catalytic hydrogenolysis. If the optional thiation reaction is to be carried out in order to obtain a compound of formula I , wherein one or the other of R₁ and R₂ is a carbonyl containing group and X is sulphur, it is preferred to use in the acylation reaction the corresponding compound of formula II , wherein R₁ or R₂ is a protected carbonyl containing group, and after thiation to convert the protected carbonyl containing group into the required carbonyl containing group for R₁ or R₂. Without such protection, the additional carbonyl group may give rise to a competing side reaction. Examples of preferred carbonyl protecting groups include ketalising agents, which may be added and removed in conventional manner. Examples of an optional conversion of R₁ or R₂ in the resulting compound of formula I into another R₁ or R₂, as defined hereinbefore, include the optional conversion of an α hydroxyethyl group into acetyl by oxidation, the optional conversion of an amino group into a chlorine atom by the Sandmeyer reaction the optional conversion of an amino group into an amino group substituted by one or two C₁ ₆ alkyl or by C₂ ₇ alkanoyl, or the optional conversion of a hydrogen atom into a nitro group by nitration. Examples of an optional conversion of R₅ in a compound of formula I into another R₅ are generally known in the art. For example, when R₅ is hydroxy, it may be alkylated using an alkyl iodide in an inert solvent, such as toluene, in the presence of a base, such as potassium hydroxide, or it may be acylated using a carboxylic acid chloride or anhydride in a non hydroxylic solvent in the presence of a base such such as triethylamine. Alternatively, when R₅ is C₂ ₇ acyloxy or it may be converted into hydroxy by conventional hydrolysis with for example, dilute mineral acid. The optional dehydration of a resulting compound of formula I , wherein R₅ and R₆ are hydroxy and hydrogen respectively, into another compound of formula I , wherein R₅ and R₆ together are a bond, may be carried out in accordance with conventional dehydration conditions, for example, by using a dehydrating agent, such as sodium hydride, in an inert solvent, such as dry tetrahydrofuran, at reflux temperature. The optional thiation of the R₈ N CO R₇ group in a compound of formula I to give another compound of formula I , wherein X is sulphur, is, preferably, carried out with conventional thiation agents, such as hydrogen sulphide, phosporous pentasulphide and Lawesson s reagent p methoxyphenylthiophosphine sulphide dimer . The use of hydrogen sulphide or phosporous pentasulphide may lead to side reactions and, therefore, the use of Lawesson s reagent is preferred. The thiation reaction conditions are conventional for the thiation agent employed. For example, the use of hydrogen sulphide is, preferably, acid catalysed by, for example, hydrogen chloride in a polar solvent, such as acetic acid or ethanol. The preferred use of Lawesson s reagent is preferably carried out under reflux in a dry solvent, such as toluene or methylene chloride. The optional formation of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, when the resulting compound of formula I contains a salifiable group may be carried out conventionally. A compound of formula II may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula V wherein R₁ , R₂ , R₃ and R₄ are as defined hereinbefore, with a compound of formula VI The reaction is normally carried out in a solvent, such as a C₁ ₄ alcohol, in particular methanol, ethanol or propanol at an ambient or an elevated temperature, for example 12 to 100 The resulting compound of formula II may be removed from the reaction mixture by removal of the solvent, for example, by evaporation under reduced pressure. Any epoxide impurity may be removed conventionally, for example by chromatography. The optional conversion of the hydroxy group for R₅ in the resulting compound of formula II into a C₁ ₆ alkoxy or C₁ ₇ acyloxy group may be carried out as described hereinbefore in relation to the corresponding conversion of R₅ in a compound of formula I . A compound of formula VI may be prepared, preferably wherein R₁ , R₂ , R₃ and R₄ are as defined hereinbefore and the hydroxy group is trans to the bromo atom, with a base, such as potassium hydroxide, in a solvent, such as ether or aqueous dioxan. Compounds of formula VII are known and may be prepared in accordance with any appropriate known process, for example, by the process described in the aforementioned U.S. patents and European patent publications. Schematically, such process can be depicted thus. The above process may produce mixtures of compounds during reaction b owing to the two sites available for ring formation. It is therefore advisable to remove any of the undesired compound by, for example, chromatography, before reaction c or d . As mentioned previously, the compounds of formula I exist in optically active forms, and the processes of the present invention produce mixtures of such forms. The individual isomers may be separated one from the other by chromatography using a chiral phase. It is preferred that the compounds of formula I are isolated in substantially pure form. The compounds of formula V to VII are also known or can be prepared analogously to the preparation of known compounds, or are routinely derivable from known compounds. As mentioned previously, the compounds of formula I have been found to have blood pressure lowering activity. They are therefore useful in the treatment of hypertension. The present invention accordingly provides a pharmaceutical composition which comprises a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In particular, the present invention provides an anti hypertensive pharmaceutical composition which comprises an anti hypertensive effective amount of a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The compositions are preferably adapted for oral administration. However, they may be adapted for other modes of administration, for example parenteral administration for patients suffering from heart failure. The present invention further provides a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof for use in the treatment or prophylaxis of maladies in mammals, in particular of hypertension.
