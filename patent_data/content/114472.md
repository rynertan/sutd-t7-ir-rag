# Valve assembly for the supply of a pressurized gaseous fluid to closed containers.

## Abstract
A double acting valve for the supply of a pressurized gaseous fluid to a closed container includes a resilient sleeve shaped pressure valve member 7 co operating with a seat 10 in a part 11 of the valve housing and forming per se a seat 9 for a non return valve ball 8 . The pressure valve member 7 is releasably secured at the lower end of the tubing 5 which can be connected with a source of compressed air and is displaceable in a part 2 of the valve housing. When separating the tubing 5 from the pressure valve member 7 all movable elements may be detached from the housing so that an efficient cleaning can be effected.
