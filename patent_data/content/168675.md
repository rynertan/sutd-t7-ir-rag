# Finger actuated medication infusion system.

## Abstract
A Finger Actuated Medication Infusion System FAMIS 5 for delivering a dosage of medication into a living body. The FAMIS is fully mechanical and comprises a reservoir 10 , a pump 60 and connecting catheters 58 . The reser voir 10 includes a sealed bellows portion 21 which con tains a pressurant and exerts a substantially constant pres sure on the medication in the reservoir 10 , regardless of the amount of medication therein. The pump 60 includes a bellows assembly 81 disposed within an equalizing pres sure chamber 63 , and will deliver medication through the bellows assembly 81 at a predetermined flow rate in dependent of ambient temperature, ambient pressure or the amount of medication remaining in the reservoir 10 . The FAMIS design also provides safeguards against inadvertant overdosing, transmission of bacteria into the body and prevents gas bubbles within the reservoir 10 from imped ing the flow of medication through an outlet flow restrictor 98 which forms part of the FAMIS pump 60 .
