# Analysis of liquid streams using tubing with protuberances on its inner wall.

## Abstract
The constituents of a liquid stream are analyzed by flowing the stream through a hollow tube or fiber 30 with spaced protuberances 34,35 of a character to disrupt laminar flow and to produce turbulence. In one embodiment, the tubing 30 includes ion exchange sites and is preferen tially permeable to one of the ions of an electrolyte. In this manner, the tubing 30 is useful as an electrolyte suppressor in ion chromatography in which the analyte ions are separated by chromatography using the electrolyte and the electrolyte is converted to weakly ionized form by passage through the tubing 30 prior to conductivity detection.
