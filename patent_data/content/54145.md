# Method and apparatus for filling of flexible containers.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a method and an apparatus for filling bulk material in flexible containers. The filling is carried out through a filling pipe or spout while the container is hanging on a hook. The impervious part of the container, which may be in form of an inner bag, is fastened around the spout and kept in place during the filling operation without any special fastening means. This is obtained by first hanging at least one lifting loop on the hook before the pipe is put into the container. Then the remaining loops are hooked on to the hook during simultaneous or subsequent filling of the container with air. The loops are secured together while the container is hanging on the hook. Thus the container will be made ready for further transport as soon as it is filled and its impervious bag is closed. The apparatus comprises a batch weigher, storage bin 1 having an outlet into a funnel 3 with a pipe 4 for supplying air, possibly also comprising dust removing means connected thereto. The funnel 3 is connected to a filling pipe 7 which is horizontally movable and placed close to a holding device comprising a hook 11 which is movable both horizontally and vertically.
