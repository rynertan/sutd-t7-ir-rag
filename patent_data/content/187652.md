## Description
The present invention relates to a novel, high water absorptive soft contact lens, and more particularly to a high water absorptive soft contact lens made of a copolymer prepared by copolymerizing an acrylate polymer or a methacrylate polymer hereinafter referred to as meth acrylate polymer having hydrophilic groups and at least one polymerizable group and hydrophilic monomers as main components. It has been well known that among various materials for contact lens use, a material having a property that it is swollen to soften by absorbing water, is preferred in obtaining a soft contact lens having a good sensation of wearing. Material mainly composed of polyhydroxyalkyl methacrylate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, or the like has been used in the above mentioned materials. The material mainly composed of polyvinylpyrrolidone is excellent in water absorptive property and gas permeability, and has a high safety for eyes from the physiological point of view because oxygen physiologically required for cornea is supplied enough from the open air to the cornea through water impregnated in a contact lens. The material mainly composed of polyvinyl pyrrolidone has excellent properties as mentioned above. However, because it has a high water content, it shows remarkable deterioration of dynamical properties when it is swollen with water, and consequently, it has a problem in durability of being easily damaged when formed into a lens. In order to solve the above mentioned problems in durability, it is disclosed in Japanese Examined Patent Publication No. 43085 1982 to produce a comb type block polymer by introducing suitably the side chain having a size within a certain range of polymethyl methacrylate into the main chain of a hydrophilic polymer, thereby improving mechanical strength, while maintaining the preferable nature of the hydrophilic polymer. However, the polymethyl methacrylate having a polymerizable group in one end of the molecule which is disclosed in the above mentioned publication has the disadvantages in productivity. That is to say, it is difficult to control the reaction so as to produce only the polymethyl methacrylate in good efficiency in the industrial production thereof, particularly in large quantities, the mixture of a polymethyl methacrylate having a polymerizable group in the molecular chain end and a polymethyl methacrylate not having a polymerizable group is apt to be produced. Accordingly, when a hydrophilic monomer is copolymerized with the polymethyl methacrylate, the produced comb type block copolymer contains the polymethyl methacrylate not copolymerized with hydrophilic monomer, thus the devitrification phenomena may appear when impregnated with water and the yield of the copolymer having good qualities is decreased. The water content of the material mainly composed of polyhydroxyalkyl methacrylate is about 30 to 40 by weight, and therefore, this material is superior in the dynamical properties to the material mainly composed of polyvinylpyrrolidone. However, it has such problems that the water content is low and oxygen required for cornea is not enough supplied from the open air to the cornea through water impregnated in a contact lens. EP A 0 129 840 discloses a method of manufacturing a shaped article of hydrogel by the polymerization in a mold of a mixture comprising The present invention is accomplished in order to obtain a high water absorptive soft contact lens which does not have the remarkable deterioration of dynamical properties when it is swollen with water and which is excellent in transparency. In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a high water absorptive soft contact lens made of a copolymer comprising wherein R¹, R² and R³ are the same or different and each is hydrogen atom or methyl group, R⁴ is an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, R⁵ is an alkoxy group having hydroxyl group, hydroxyl group or N CH₃ ₂, A is a polymerizable group, and p, q and r are integers to show a containing ratio of hydrophilic groups and polymerizable groups, satisfying the formula which copolymer is prepared by copolymerizing In the present invention, there can be obtained a high water absortive soft contact lens excellent in transparency because the above mentioned meth acrylate polymer, that it is a reignforcing material, has a hydrophilic group and at least one polymerizable group in the molecule, and is suitably copolymerized with the above mentioned hydrophilic monomers, and moreover, the copolymer is not formed in phase separation structure. In the present invention, meth acrylate polymer having a hydrophilic group and at least one polymerizable group in the molecule is a component in order to reinforce a formed copolymer without remarkable deterioration of strengh and devitrification phenomena when the hydrophilic polymer which is derived from a hydrophilic monomer selected from the group consisting of an N vinyllactam, acrylamide, N substituted acrylamide derivative, methacrylamide and N substituted methacrylamide derivate is impregnated with water. The hydrophilic group and at least one polymerizable group are introduced into the meth acrylate polymer in order to reinforce the copolymer effectively without causing devitrification phenomena. The meth acrylate polymer is prepared, for instance, by copolymerizing an alkyl meth acrylate monomer a which is used in order to form the skeleton of the polymer, a meth acrylic monomer having a hydrophilic group b which is used in order to introduce a hydrophilic group into the molecule of the polymer and a monomer having at least two polymerizable groups c which is used in order to introduce at least one polymerizable group into the molecule of the polymer. The alkyl meth acrylate monomer a , the meth acrylic monomer having a hydrophilic group b and the monomer having at least two polymerizable groups are explained below. The alkyl meth acrylate monomer a is one having linear, branched or cyclic alkyl group, which may be substituted with a halogen atom such as fluorine atom. Representative examples of the alkyl meth acrylate monomer a are, for instance, methyl meth acrylate, ethyl meth acrylate, propyl meth acrylate, butyl meth acrylate, trifluoroethyl meth acrylate and pentafluoroethyl meth acrylate . The alkyl meth acrylate monomers may be employed alone or in admixture thereof. The meth acrylic monomer having a hydrophilic group b is one having a hydrophilic group such as hydroxyl, carboxyl or an N dimethyl substituted amide. Representative examples of the meth acrylic monomer having a hydrophilic group b are, for instance, a meth acrylate having a hydroxyl group such as hydroxyethyl meth acrylate, hydroxypropyl meth acrylate, hydroxybutyl meth acrylate, dihydroxypropyl meth acrylate, dihydroxypropyl meth acrylate, dihydroxybutyl meth acrylate, meth acrylic acid N,N dimethyl meth acrylamide. Also, a ketalized dihydroxyalkyl meth acrylate in which 2 hydroxyl groups are ketalized such as 2,3 o isopropylidene glycerol meth acrylate, 2 methyl 2 ethyl 4 meth acryloxymethyl 1,3 dioxolane or methyl 2,3 o isopropylidene glycerol, can be employed in the invention as the monomer b to obtain substantially the same effects as those produced by the above mentioned monomers. In that case, the ketal group is eliminated to produce hydroxyl groups by acid treatment after the polymerization. These monomers b may be employed alone or in admixture thereof. Representative exmaples of the monomer having two polymerizable groups c are, for instance, ethylene glycol di meth acrylate, allyl meth acrylate, vinyl meth acrylate, diethylene glycol di meth acrylate, triethylene glycol di meth acrylate, propylene glycol di meth acrylate, dipropylene glycol di meth acrylate, and the like. These monomers c may be employed alone or in admixture thereof. When the meth acrylate polymer having a hydrophilic group and at least one polymerizable group in the molecule A used in the present invention is prepared, a lower alkyl meth acrylate is preferably used as a component of the alkyl meth acrylate monomer in order to make the copolymerization of the meth acrylate polymer A and the hydrophilic monomer selected from the group consisting of an N vinyllactam, acrylamide, n substituted acrylamide derivative, methacrylamide and N substituted methacrylamide derivative good without causing steric hindrance. Also, since the copolymerizability is different between vinyl group and meth acryloyl group or between allyl group and meth acryloyl group, it is preferable to select the monomer c with giving a consideration to the copolymerizability between the polymerizable group of the polymer A and the polymerizable group of the hydrophilic monomer B . For instance, when the N vinyllactam is employed as the hydrophilic monomer B , it is preferable that a meth acrylate monomer having a vinyl group such as allyl meth acrylate or vinyl meth acrylate is employed as the component c . When the meth acrylamide in which hydrogen atom bonded to nitrogen atom which may be substituted is employed as the hydrophilic monomer B , it is preferable that a meth acrylate monomer having a meth acryloyl group such as ethylene glycol di meth acrylate or diethylene glycol di meth acrylate is employed as the component c . When the N vinyllactam and the meth acrylamide in which hydrogen atom bonded to nitrogen atom which may be substituted are employed at the same time, it is preferable that the meth acrylate monomer having vinyl group and the meth acrylate monomer having a meth acryloyl group are employed at the same time. The meth acrylate polymer having a hydrophilic group and at least one polymerizable group in its molecule A used in the present invention can be obtained by copolymerizing the monomers a , b and c . However, it is necessary to control the copolymerization condition so that all polymerizable groups in the monomer c which is employed in order to introduce polymerizable groups into the obtained copolymer, do not participate in polymerization, in other words, cross linking reaction does not occur, at the time when the monomers a , b and c are copolymerized. Therefore, a solution polymerization is preferably employed as a polymerization method. Any solvents can be used in the above solution polymerization, so long as they well dissolve and do not hinder the polymerization. For instance, benzene, acetone and the like can be used and may be employed alone or in admixture thereof. The amount of the solvent varies depending on the polymerization conditions. A suitable amount of the solvent is employed. The polymerization reaction condition cannot be wholly determined because there is corelation between reaction temperature and reaction time. Therefore, it is practically preferable that the copolymerization reaction is carried out at comparatively low temperatures, e.g. at a temperature of 50 to 80 C, for several minutes to several hours. When polymerizing the monomers a , b and c , usual polymerization initiators such as azobisisobutyronitrile, azobisdimethyl valeronitrile, t butyl hydroperoxide, cumene hydroperoxide and benzoyl peroxide can be employed. The amount of the polymerization initiator is from about 0.001 to about 5 parts by weight, preferably, from about 0.01 to about 2 parts by weight based on the 100 parts by weight of all of the monomers used in the polymerization. It is possible to control the composition of the meth acrylate polymer A , that is, it is possible to control the numbers of polymerizable groups and hydrophilic groups in the polymer A by adjusting the amount of each of the monomers a , b and c when preparing the meth acrylate polymer A used in the present invention. For giving the excellent reinforcing effect, it is preferable that the proportion of the monomer c used to introduce polymerizable groups is about 0.2 to about 5 by mole based on the total amount of the monomers used and the proportion of the monomer b used to introduce hydrophilic groups is about 1 to about 30 by mole based on the total amount of the monomers used. Regarding the proportion of the monomer c as the number of polymerizable groups, it is necessary that the number of polymerizable groups is at least one in one meth acrylate polymer molecule for giving the reinforcing effect. In case that the number average molecular weight is 10,000 to 50,000, it is preferable that the number of polymerizable groups is at most about 5. When the number of polymerizable groups is more than the above range it is hard to obtain the preferable copolymer having high water content because the cross linking density of the copolymer prepared by copolymerizing the meth acrylate polymer A with the hydrophilic monomer B rises too high, thus resulting in lowering of the water content of the obtained copolymer. On the other hand, in case that the proportion of the hydrophilic groups in the meth acrylate polymer A is less than the above range, the devitrification phenomena occurs in the obtained contanct lens when the lens is impregnated with water, and in case that the proportion of the hydrophilic groups in the meth acrylate polymer A is more than the above range, the meth acrylate polymer A cannot have the sufficient reinforcing effect. The monomers a , b and c are employed in the above mentioned method for preparing the meth acrylate polymer A . However, the meth acrylate polymer A can be synthesized by the following methods which are the methods introducing a polymerizable groups into the copolymer without employing the monomer c . In the above mentioned processes 1 to 3, the reaction is carried out in two stages, but the before mentioned process in which the monomers a , b and c are copolymerized, is preferable from the view point of obtaining the meth acrylate polymer A in high industrial productivity, since the meth acrylate polymer A can be obtained in one stage reaction. The thus synthesized meth acrylate polymer A is coloress and transparent in the form of a solution thereof in a solvent and is white powder in the dry state. According to a gel permeation chromatography hereinafter referred to as GPC using polystyrene calibration curve, the number average molecular weight The copolymer employed in the soft contact lens of the present invention is pepared by copolymerizing the thus obtained meth acrylate polymer A and the hydrophilic monomer B selected from the group consisting of an N vinyllactam, acrylamide, N substituted acrylamide derivative, methacrylamide and N substituted methacrylamide derivative. Examples of the N vinyllactams are, for instance, N vinylpyrrolidone, N vinylpiperidone, N vinylcaprolactam, and their derivatives in which the lactam ring has at least one lower alkyl substituent having 1 to 4 carbon atoms. However, these N vinyllactams are not limited to the exemplified ones. Other compounds having similar properties to those of the above mentioned N vinyllactams, namely those having polymerizaing groups and proving hydrophilic properties to the produced copolymer, can be used in the invention as well as the N vinyllactam. Accordingly, the term N vinyllactam as used herein means the above mentioned N vinyllactam and the compounds having similar properties e.g. N vinyl heterocyclic compounds such as α methylene N methylpyrrolidone. These compounds may be employed together with or instead of N vinyllactams. Examples of the above mentioned meth acrylamide in which hydrogen atoms attached to the nitrogen atom may be substituted are, for instance, meth acrylamide, N methyl meth acrylamide, N ethyl meth acrylamide, N hydroxyethyl meth acrylamide, N,N dimethyl meth acrylamide, N,N diethyl meth acrylamide, N ethyl N aminoethyl meth acrylamide, and the like, but these meth acrylamides are not limited to the exemplified ones. These hydrophilic monomers may be employed alone or in admixture thereof. The proportion of the hydrophilic monomer B and the meth acrylate polymer A is about 90 about 10 to about 60 about 40 by weight, preferably about 85 about 15 to about 70 about 30. The meth acrylate polymer A is used to reinforce the resulting copolymer prepared by copolymerization of the meth acrylate polymer A and the hydrophilic monomer B . It is necessary that the amount of the meth acrylate polymer A is not less than 10 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the total of the meth acrylate polymer A and the hydrophilic monomer B . On the other hand, it is necessary that the amount is not more than 40 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the total of the meth acrylate polymer A and the hydrophilic monomers B for maintaining high water absorptive property of the soft contact lens. When the high water absorptive soft contact lens of the invention is prepared, as occasion demands, usual hydrophylic monomers such as meth acrylic acid, hydroxyethyl meth acrylate, dihydroxypropyl meth acrylate and alkoxypolyethylene glycol mono meth acrylate may be employed instead of the part of the above mentioned hydrophilic monomer B . In such a case, it is preferable that the amount of the above mentioned usual hydrophilic monomers is not more than about 20 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the total amount of the above mentioned usual hydrophilic monomers and the hydrophilic monomer B in order to maintain the water absorptive property of the obtained copolymer high. Of course, the ratio of the hydrophilic monomer and the meth acrylate polymer A should be within the above mentioned range. Moreover, it is possible that hydrophobic monomers such as methyl meth acrylate and styrene are admixed with the hydrophilic monomers, and an usual cross linking agent such as ethylene glycol dimethacrylate or allyl methacrylate is employed from the view point of the compatibility. When the copolymer used in the invention is prepared, a usual bulk polymerization process is preferably applicable for obtaining the soft contact lens of the invention in high productivity, and, if necessary, a solution polymerization process may be applied. In the both of the above mentioned polymerization methods, it is preferable to employ a temperature elevation method, e.g. a method in which the heat polymerization is carried out at about 40 to about 50 C for seveal hours to several tens of hours, and then polymerization is completed by heating at a rate of about 10 C several hours. The amount of the polymerization initiator employed in the preparation of the meth acrylate polymer A is about 0.001 to about 5 parts by weight, preferably about 0.01 to about 2 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the whole amounts of the polymerizable monomers. The high water absorptive soft contact lens of the present invention can be prepared by the methods, that is, conducting the meth acrylate polymer A and the hydrophilic monomer B into a mold corresponding to the predetermined shape of a contact lens to give a contact lens having the predetermined shape, or preparing a copolymer by copolymerizaing the meth acrylate polymer A and the hydrophilic monomer B and processing the copolymer by a mechanical method such as cutting or polishing to give a contact lens shape, then impregnating the obtained copolymer with water to give the desired high water absorptive property. When employing the meth acrylate polymer having ketalized dihydroxyalkyl groups in its molecule, it is necessary that the contact lens is subjected to the deketalation, a reaction that ketal groups are converted into hydroxyl groups by employing usual acids after molding the contact lens, as described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication Tokkyo Kokai No. 176618 1983. The present invention is more specifically described and explained by means of the following Examples in which all percents and parts are by weight unless otherwise noted. A three necked round bottom flask was charged with 7.5 g 5 parts of 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate, 142.5 g 95 parts of methyl methacrylate, 0.93 g 0.62 part of allyl methacrylate, 0.73 g 0.49 part of ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, 2.0 g 1.3 parts of azobisisobutyronitrile as a polymerization initiator and 600 ml of benzene as a solvent, and the polymerization reacion was carried out at a temperature of 70 C for 1.5 hours with stirring. Then, the reaction mixture was poured into n hexane to give a precipitate, and the obtained precipitate was dried under reduced pressure. The precipitate dissolved in benzene was poured into a large amount of n hexane, and then it was reprecipitated, purified and dried under reduced pressure to give a meth acrylate polymer having a hydrophilic group and a polymerizable group in its molecule. The molecular weight of the obtained meth acrylate polymer was measured according to the following method. The results are shown in Table 1 with yields. The measurement of molecular weight is carried out by using a Trirotor III GPC analyzer made by Japan Spectroscopic Co., Ltd. , detector Shodex RI SE 31 made by Showa Denko Kabushiki Kaisha column Shodex PAK GPC KF 804 made by Showa Denko Kabushiki Kaisha medium tetrahydrofuran in conditions of a column temperature of 40 C and a flow rate of 1.0 ml min. The procedure of Reference Example 1 was repeated except that components and amounts shown in Table 1 were employed to prepare a meth acrylate polymer having a hydrophilic group and a polymerizable group in its molecule and a methyl meth acrylate polymer not having a hydrophilic group in its molecule, respectively. Molecular weights of the obtained meth acrylate polymers and methyl meth acrylate polymers were respectively measured in the same manner as in Reference Example 1. The results are shown in Table 1 with yields. The hydrophilic monomer, meth acrylate polymer and polymerization initiator shown in Table 2 were admixed in amounts shown in Table 2 to give a mixture. In Examples 11 to 23, the obtained mixture dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate overnight. A polypropylene test tube having an inside diameter of 18 mm was charged with the mixture and the polymerization was stepwise carried out at 35 C for 40 hours, at 50 C for 8 hours and then, the test tube was heated up to 110 C at the rate of 10 C 90 min. After the product was taken out from the test tube and cured at 90 C for 2 hours, the obtained rod was subjected to mechanical processing to give a lens. The obtained lens dipped with physiological saline solution was transparent, excellent in strength and flexible when it was impregnated with water. The film of the copolymer which thickness was about 0.2 mm and a diameter was about 20 mm when impregnated with water, was processed from the rods, and the physical properties of the copolymer were measured by the following method. The results are shown in Table 2. Appearence of equilibrium wet film is observed with the naked eyes. Water content is calculated on the basis of the following formula. Linear swelling ratio is calculated on the basis of the following formula. A pressure needle having a diameter of 1 16 inch is put on the center of the film impregnated with water a thickness about 0.2 mm and a weight g is measured at the time when the film is penetrated by employing an Instron compression tester. Elongation ratio of the film is measured at the time when needle penetration strength g is measured. The value shows the elongation at breaking. Strength index is calculated on basis of the following formula. The physical properties of a high water absorptive soft contact lens prepared from commercially available N vinylpyrrolidone as a main component were measured in the same manner as in Example 1. The soft contact lens had a water content of 78.0 a thickness 0.2 mm , a needle penetration strength of 125 g, an elongation ratio of 64 and a strength index of 20. From the above mentioned results, although the high water absorptive soft contact lens of the present invention has high water content water content about 75 to 80 , it is confirmed that the contact lens is excellent in transparency and dynamical properties mechanical strength or stability of shape when impregnated with water. The high water absorptive soft contact lens of the present invention has the following advantages.
