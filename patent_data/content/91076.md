## Description
MODIFICATION OF ZEOLITES BY TREATMENT WITH CHLORIN GAS Brief Summary of the InventionTechnical Fiela This invention is directed in general to a process for enhancing the hydrophobicity of crystalline zeolites ana to crystalline zeolite compositions which have enhanced hydrophobic character and moditiea catalytic properties. More particularly, this invention is airectea to crystalline aluminosilicate zeolites which have been treated with chlorine gas to alter 1 the tramework aluminum content, 2 surface characteristics, ana 3 the acidic sites of the zeolites with resulting modification of both the adsorptive properties, i.e., enhanced hydrophobicity, and catalytic properties ot the zeolites.Background Art Although there are a few notable exceptions, the vast majority of naturally occurring and synthetic crystalline aluminosilicate zeolites contain a substantial proportion ofA104 tetraheara, i.e., framework aluminum atoms, which together with the S104 tetrahedra comprise the zeolite crystal tramework. It is generally acceptea that these aluminum containing structural units proviae the so callea Macid sites which account for the catalytic activity of zeolites in such hydrocarbon conversion reactions as catalytic cracking. These same acia sites are also responsible in one or more ways for the adsorptive preference of most zeolites for strongly polar molecules such as water, l.e., their hyarophilic character. A number of different tecnniques have heretofore been proposea to remove framework aluminum atoms from zeolites to create aluminum deficient lattice structures having fewer acid sites, and consequently less hydrophilicity and more hydrophobicity, ana an altered catalytic activity. In some instances the techniques employea are too rigorous to permit sufficient dealumination to significantly alter either the hydrophilicity or the catalytic activity before causing the collapse ot the entire crystal lattice. In other cases, the lattice structure of the starting zeolite has sufficient integrity so that the aealumination is permitted to proceed to a degree which engenders a remarkable degree of hydrophobicity in the product zeolite ana further enhances its thermal ana or hyarothermal stability. A number of aifrerent techniques have heretofore been known to remove framework aluminum atoms from zeolites, such as mineral acid treatment. One of the more common early techniques for dealuminizing zeolites involves contacting either the hydrogen or the decationizea form of the zeolite with a known chelating agent for aluminum, such as ethylene aiaminetetraacetic acid EDTA or acetylacetone, and removing aluminum as an organometallic complex. A more recent and more widely used procedure involves prolongea contact of non metallic cation forms of zeolites with steam at elevated temperatures which can exceed 800or. Althougn quite effective for the intended purpose, the steaming procedures are very costly ana highly energy consuming. French Patent 2,303,764 describes a process tor increasing the molar ratio of SiO2 A1203 in the chystalline skeleton ot zeolites havingSiO2 A1203 molar ratios of less than 5. The zeolites are first dehydrated by heating to a temperature of at least 4000C in a reactor equipped with at least one opening in the presence of air or inert gases. Thereafter, gases containing chlorine ana or hyarochloric acid are reacted with the dehydrated zeolite at temperatures between 4000C and 700 C. It is stated that the zeolite product can then be treated by washing with aqueous solutions of ammonium salts or salts which give ammonium ions, strong aqueous mineral acids, caustic soda or alkaline solutions, or distillea water.Example 11 illustrates that the capacity of aasorpion of zeolites with respect to water vapor is practically not alterea by treatment of the zeolites accoraing to the process described therein. U.S. Patent 4,297,335 assigned to UnionCarbide Corporation describes crystalline zeolite compositions which have been treated with fluorine gas to alter the framework aluminum content and acidic sites ana thereby enhance the hydrophobic cnaracter of tne zeolites. The crystalline zeolite compositions have at least 50 percent of the framework aluminum atoms not associated with metal cations and are contacted with fluorine at a temperature of from about 500F to 4000F. H. K. Beyer and I. Belenyka3a, A New Method tor the Dealumination of Faujasite Type Zeolites,Catalysis by Zeolites, Printed in The Netherlanas, 203 209 1980 describes the dealumination of faujasite type zeolites, particularly Y zeolites, using silicon tetrachloride as the aealuminiziny agent. However, none pf these references disclose a process for enhancing the hydrophobicity of crystalline zeolites according to the present invention in which crystalline aluminosilicate zeolites are treated with chlorine gas ana thereafter purged with nitrogen gas to alter 1 the framework aluminum content, 2 surface characteristics and 3 the acidic sites of the zeolites with resulting modification of both the adsorptive properties, i.e., enhanced hydrophobicity, and catalytic properties of the zeolites. In addition, the crystalline aluminosilicate zeolites of the present invention have extended storage capabilities due to the removal of entrappea chlorine gas from the treated activated aluminosilicate zeolite by purging the zeolite with nitrogen gas.The removal of entrapped chlorine gas can prevent the formation of aqueous hydrochloric acid upon the introduction of any moisture into the zeolite. Sufficient amounts of aqueous hydrochloric acid can cause degradation of the structural aluminum tramework of the zeolite especially at SiO2 A12O3 molar ratios of less than about 10.Disclosure of Invention It is therefore the primary object of the present invention to provide an alternate process for enhancing the hydrophobic character and stability of zeolites b decreasing the number of acia sites in tne framework structure. This primary object is accomplished by the process which comprises a providing an activated crystalline zeolitic aluminosilicate having an initial SiO2 A1203 molar ratio of at least 5 b contacting said activatea aluminosilicate with substantially pure chlorine gas at a temperature of from about 200C to about 10000C for a perioa of time sufficient to react the chlorine gas witn a significant amount of structural aluminum in said activated aluminosilicate to increase the initial SiO2 A1203 molar ratio of the activated aluminosilicate and c purging the activated aluminosilicate with a purge gas for a sufficient time to remove entrapped chlorine gas from the treated activated aluminosilicate. A preferred embodiment of the present invention comprises washing the activated aluminosilicate with water for a sufficient time to remove entrapped metal chloride species such as aluminum chloride, alkali metal chlorides ana alkaline earth metal chlorides from the treated activated aluminosilicate. Metal cations associated with the chlorine treated activatea aluminosilicate can be replacea with non metallic hydrogen cations by this water washing step. Conventional ion exchange techniques must tirst treat a metal cation aluminosilicate with, for example, an ammonium chloriae solution ana thereafter tne resulting nonmetallic ammonium cation aluminosilicate is calcined at elevated temperatures to give a nonmetallic hydrogen cation aluminosilicate. Thus, conventional ion exchange techniques can be eliminated by utilizing the water washing step. Yet another preferred embodiment of the present invention comprises calcining the activated aluminos licate at a temperature of from 5000C up to tne crystal destruction temperature or the zeolite to remove some or all of the non metallic cations to produce the corresponaing aecationized zeolite. The water washing step and the calcination step can be used in the process of this invention in combination in either order or either step may be used alone. A turther object or this invention is to provide crystalline zeolitic aluminosilicate compositions selected from the group consisting of the zeolites identifies by the numbered examples in the instant specification having the properties set forth for the numbered examples in Tables I throughVIII hereinbelow and producea according to the claimed process of this invention. The crystalline zeolitic aluminosilicate compositions prepared in accordance with the process of this invention have a crystal structure selected from the group consisting of erionite, mordenite, zeolite Y, zeolite L and zeolite LZ 105 including non cation forms and cation forms containing cations selected from the group consisting of alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, ammonium and hydrogen. Various other obJects and advantages of this invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the accompanying description and disclosure. Detailed Description Crystalline aluminosilicate zeolites suitably treated in accordance with the present invention include among others erionite, mordenite, zeolite Y, zeolite L, zeolite LZ 105, zeolite omega, zeolite beta, zeolite 2SM 5, zeolite ZSbi ll, zeoliteZSM 12, zeolite ZSM 34 and zeolite ZSh 45. Both naturally occurring and synthetically prepared zeolites can be usea. zeolite Y is aisclosed inU.S. Patent 3,130,007 zeolite L is disclosed inU.S. Patent 3,216,789 zeolite LZ 105 is disclosea in U.S Patent 4,257,885 zeolite omega is aisclosea in U.S. Patent 4,241,036 zeolite beta is disclosed in U.s.

The preparationsof crystalline aluminosilicate zeolites utilized in the working examples hereinbelow is described in each example.The preferred crystalline aluminosilicate zeolites for use in the present invention have a crystal structure selected from the group consisting of erionite, moraenite, zeolite Y, zeolite L ana zeolite LZ 105 including non cation forms ana cation forms containing cations selected from the group consisting of alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, ammonium and hydrogen. The activated crystalline aluminosilicate zeolites utilized in the process of this invention have an initial SiO2 A1203 molar ratio of at least 5, preferably from 5 to about 190. Tne zeolite species can be used in their non merallic cation forms as well as their as synthesizea metallic cation forms without further modification of their cation population. The zeolite species can also be utilized in their decationized form. In those cases in which it is desirable to decrease the proportion of metal cations associated with the AlO4 tetrahedra prior to their use in the process of this invention, conventional ion exchange techniques can be resorted to in oraer to replace a sufficient proportion of metal cations with non metallic cations such as hydrogen, ammonium or quaternary ammonium species.The zeolites can, it aesirea, be calcined to thermally remove some or all of the non metallic cations to produce the corresponding aecationizea form. Calcination at a temperature of about 4000C for two hours is usually sufficient to activate hyaratea zeolites through the evolution of the water of hydration. Tne activated crystalline aluminosilicate zeolites are contacted with substantially pure chlorine gas, preferably 100 pure chlorine gas, at a temperature range of from about 2000C to about 10000C. Lower temperatures generally cannot be used because chlorine gas does not react with the structural aluminum of the zeolite at these lower temperatures. higher temperatures generally can cause at least partial destruction of the crystalline structure of the zeolite. The preferred temperature for contacting pure chlorine gas with the activated crystalline aluminosilicate zeolite is from about 4000C to about 8U00C. The process or this invention is preferably carried out at ambient pressure, however both atmospheric and superatmospheric pressure conditions may be employed in this process. The chlorine gas is reacted with a significant amount of structural aluminum within the activated crystalline aluminosilicate zeolite at the temperatures described above and for a sufficient period of time to increase the initial SiO2 A1203 molar ratio of the activated crystalline aluminosilicate zeolite. In general, the reaction time can vary trom a few minutes or less to several hours or longer, i.e., rrom 1 minute or shorter to 10 hours or longer. The preferred reaction time is from about one nour to about four hours. It is readily. appreciated that the required reaction time will be influenceu by tne reaction temperature, total pressure, concentration and flow rate of cnlorine gas, concentration and choice of the activated crystalline aluminosilicate zeolite and other factors. The process of the present invention is suitably conducted under operative conditions which give reasonable chlorine reaction rates and, of course, the desired increase in the initial SiO2 A1203 molar ratio of the activated crystalline aluminosilicate zeolite. After the crystalline aluminosilicate zeolites are reacted with chlorine gas under the above described operational conditions, the zeolites are purgea with a purge gas such as nitrogen, dry air or the inert gases tor a sufficient time to remove entrapped chlorine gas from the treated activated crystalline aluininosilicate zeolite. In general, the purging time is not narrowly critical can vary from a few seconds to several minutes or longer. The preferrea purging time is from about 10 minutes to about 30 minutes. However, the total purging time will be influenced by the concentration ana choice of the activated crystalline aluminosilicate zeolite, the amount of chlorine gas entrapped in the zeolite and other factors.The purging step of the present invention is preferably conductea under operative conditions which give essentially complete removal of residual chlorine gas from the treated activated crystalline aluminosilicate zeolite. The preferred purging gas for use in this invention is nitrogen. The removal of essentially all residual chlorine gas in the activated crystalline aluminosilicate zeolite by purging with nitrogen gas proviaes for extended storage capabilities of the zeolite proaucts. The removal or entrapped chlorine gas can prevent the formation of aqueous hydrochloric acid upon the introauction of any moisture into the zeolite product. Sufficient amounts of aqueous hydrochloric acid can cause aegtaaation of the structural aluminum framework of the zeolite product especiaily at SiO2 A1203 molar ratios of less than about 10.The hydrophobic character of the zeolite product attained by treating the zeolite according to the process of this invention is likewise deteriorated as a result of the action of aqueous hyarocnloric acid on the structural aluminum framework causing degradation thereof. The chlorine treated and purged crystalline aluminosilicate zeolite can be washea with water for a sufficient time to remove any entrapped metal chlorides from the treated crystalline aluminosiiicate zeolite. petal chlorides such as alkali metal chlorides, alkaline earth metal chlorides and aluminum cnloriae are removed from the crystalline aluminosilicate zeolite structure to further enhance the hydrophobic character of the zeolite product. Such metal chlorides can occupy the pore volume surface and cause high water aasorption near saturation. When using crystalline aluminosilicate zeolites in their cation forms including alkali metal cations and alkaline earth metal cations in the process of this invention, it is preferred to wash the chlorine treated aluminosilicate zeolite to remove any entrapped metal chloride species from the zeolite.Because many metal chlorides sublime at relatively low temperatures, the chlorine treatment step at the indicated elevated temperatures can also be used to remove impurities from the zeolite. Chlorine treated crystalline aluminosilicate zeolites in their ammonium, hydrogen or aecationized form can exhibit structural aealumination, silicon atom insertion, stabilization, aitered catalytic activity ana enhanced hyarophobicity upon utilization of the water washing step. It has been suprisingly found as a result of the present invention that metal cations associatea with the activated crystalline aluminosilicate zeolite can be replaced by non metallic hydrogen cations by utilizing only the water washing step. Thus, conventional ion exchange techniques can be eliminated by utilizing the water washing step.In general, the washing time can vary from a tew minutes to several hours or longer or even days. The total washing time will be influencea by the concentration anci choice of crystalline aluminosilicate zeolite, the amount of metal chlorides blockiny the pore structure of the zeolite ana other factors. The water washing step of the present invention is preferably conducted to remove essentially all metal chlorines from the treated activatea crystalline aluminosilicate zeolite to enhance the hyarophobic character of the zeolite product. The chlorine treated crystalline aluminosilicate zeolites can further undergo calcination at a temperature of from 5000C up to the crystal destruction temperature of the zeolites.This calcination step can remove non metallic cations such as ammonium cations from the treated aluminosilicate zeolite to give, if desired, an essentially decationized zeolite product.Decationization of crystalline aluminosilicate zeolites in their metal cation form is evidenced by the formation of water solublebmetal chlorides. The calcination step in aadition to the process step involving reacting chlorine witn the structural aluminum of the zeolite at elevated temperatures provide for high purity aluminosilicate zeolite products. The chlorine treated zeolites of this invention exhibit dealumination, decationization and enhanced hydrophobicity while retaining a high level of crystallinity even at elevated treatment temperatures utilized in the process described herein. The crystalline aluminosilicate zeolite compositions prepared in accordance with the process of the present invention can be used as selective hydrophobic adsorbants or as catalysts in, for example, hydrocarbon cracking reactions. These zeolite compositions have the properties set forth for the numbered examples in Tables I through VIII hereinbelow. The preferred crystalline aluminosilicate zeolite compositions prepared by the process bf this invention have a crystal structure selectea from the group consisting of erionite, mordenite, zeolite Y, zeolite L and zeolite LZ 105 including non cation torms and cation forms containing cations selected from the group consisting of alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, ammonium and hydrogen. Although this invention has been describea with respect to a number of details, it is not intenaed that this invention shout be limited thereby. The examples which follow are intended solely to illustrate the embodiments of this invention which to date have been determine and are not intended in any way to limit the scope and the intent of this invention. In carrying out the process of this invention, it is advantageous to utilize a quartz reactor having means for evacuatiny chlorine gas and nitrogen gas therefrom as well as means for regulating the temperature of the zeolite itself.The apparatus used in the following Examples 1 46 and Comparative Examples A AA included a high temperature tubular quartz reactor to which was attached a Pyrex glass condenser. A heating mantle or furnace was used to heat the quartz reactor. The temperature of a sample in the quartz reactor was measurea with a thermocouple imbeaaed in a thermocouple well located in the center of the reactor. A temperature controller was used to regulate the temperature to within 5 C. Tne flow of chlorine gas and nitrogen gas into the quartz reactor was controlled with a pressure regulator ana flow meter. The flow meter was maae of Inconel and honel specified for chlorine gas. Gas escaping from the Pyrex glass condenser was directed to a scrubber system consisting of a soda lime trap and a sodium bisulfite solution vented to the top of a hood.All of the connections within the apparatus were made with Teflon shrinkable tube and Teflon tubiny. The general procedure included 1 Introducing the crystalline zeolitic aluminosilicate starting material into the quartz reactor 2 adjusting the temperature to the indicated temperatures in theExamples under a continuous flow of nitrogen to remove all water of hydration 3 introducing pure chlorine gas at a minimal flow rate which results in a continuous flow of chlorine gas through the system ror a period sufficient to react with the amount of structural aluminum needed to achieve the desired SiO2 A12Oj molar. ratio in the zeolite and then 4 flushing the quartz reactor with nitrogen gas to remove all residual chlorine gas. In evaluating the hydrophobic character of the chlorine treatea crystalline aluminosilicate zeolite proaucts of the present invention, a shake test procedure was empioyed, in which 0.5 grams or the activated zeolite sample was introauced into 5 milliliters of a solution of 1.0 volume percent n butanol in water. The slurry of zeolite ana solution was shaken for about 120 minutes at room temperature, and then tne liquid phase was analyzed for residual n butanol content. The amount of n butanol adsorbed by the zeolite sample was usea to determine the percent of n butanoi adsorbed, thereby providing a measure of the relative preference of the zeolite for the less polar adsorbate, which provided a measure of the hydrophobicity of the zeolite.Another test procedure was an n hexane delta loading test wherein a test sample of the zeolite was activated under vacuum and then exposed to approximately 20 torr of water vapor at room temperature.After the adsorbed water loading on the zeolite reached a steady state under these conditions, n hexane, at a partial pressure of 40 50 mm. Hg., was introduced into the water saturated atmosphere over the zeolite. The weight gain of the zeolite mass due to adsorption of the n hexane under these conditions the delta n hexane loading directly corresponds to the degree of hydrophobicity of the zeolite. The greater the weight gain due to n hexane adsorption the greater the degree of hydrophobicity. In evaluating the catalytic character of the chlorine treated aluminosilicate zeolite products as described in Examples 38 46 andComparative Examples W AA, a test procedure was employed involving the catalytic cracking of premixed n butane at 2 mole percent in a helium stream. The mixture containing 2 mole percent n butane in helium was obtained from Union CarbideCorporation. The mixture underwent cracking in a one half inch outside diameter quartz tube reactor into which was added 0.5 to 5.0 grams at 20 40 mesh of a crystalline zeolitic aluminosilicate sample to be tested. The crystalline zeolitic aluminosilicate was activated in situ for 60 minutes at 500 C under 200 cm3 minute dry helium purge.The mixture containing 2 mole percent n butane in helium was then passed at a rate of 50 cm3 minute over the crystalline zeolitic aluminosilicate for 40 minutes, with a product stream analysis carriea out at 10 minute intervals. The first order rate constant was then calculated to determine the activity of the zeolite catalyst as follows First Order Rate Constant cm3 gm min F ln l c W where F is the flow rate in cm3 min., W is the activated crystalline zeolitic aluminosilicate sample weight in grams and c is the mole fraction of n butane consumed. EXAMPLES 1 4 AND COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE A A series ot five 50 gram samples of synthetic aecationized, steamed Y type zeolites were prepared by pelletizing approximately 208 ary weight of nitric acia peptized Catapal, a trademark ofCondea, consisting ot hydrated alumina having 74.2s A1203 ana 25.8 H2O, with approximately 80 dry weight of Linde Y 82 zeolite, a tradename ofUnion Carbiae Corporation, having a SiO2 Al2O3 molar ratio of 5.4 and a Na20 A1203 molar ratio of 0.017. After steaming all of the samples at 6000C, the samples designated as Examples 1 4 were contacted with 100 chlorine gas tor the time periods and temperatures indicated in Table I.The sample designated as Comparative Example A was not treated with chlorine gas. Tne chlorine treatea samples were thereafter purged with nitrogen gas at the same chlorine treatment temperatures indicated in Table I for about 10 minutes. All of the samples were then tested for hydrophobicity using the n nexane delta loading test as previously described, with the results set forth in Table I. The samples treated with 1008 chlorine gas at various temperatures show higher n hexane delta loading values, and thus greater hyarophobicity, than the comparative samples not treated with chlorine gas.

The samples designated as Comparative Examples B andC were not treated with chlorine gas. The chlorine treated samples were thereafter purged with nitrogen gas at the same chlorine treatment temperatures indicated in Table I for about 10 minutes. All of the samples were then tested for hydrophobicity using the n hexane delta loading technique as previously described, with the results set forth in Table I. The samples treatea with 100 chlorine gas at various temperatures show higher n hexane aelta loaaing values, and thus greater hydrophobicity, than the comparative samples not treated with chlorine gas.

The samples aesignatea as Comparative Examples I, J and K consisting respectively of the synthetic Y type zeolite, synthetic large pore hydrogen mordenite ana hydrogen erionite prepared as described above were not treated with chlorine gas. The chlorine treated samples were thereafter purged with nitrogen gas at the chlorine treatment temperatures indicated inTable V for about 10 minutes. All of the samples were then analyzed using a Fourier transform I.R. spectrometer and stanaard Kr pellet techniques.The pertinent treatment data as well as peak positions ot prominent I.R. bands are set forth inTable V. Shitts in these bands to higher wave numbers in the chlorine treated samples, as compared with the untreated comparative samples, coupled with a sharpening of some of the bands identified by Ns , are strong eviaence of structural dealumination ana stabilization respectively. EXAMPLES 30 32 AND COMPARATIVE EXAMPLES L N For the purpose of comparison with Examples 20 29, a series of three samples of various synthetic zeolites in their alkali cation form, including one sample designated as Example 30 consisting of Na ,K erionite prepared by pelletizing approximately 20 dry weight of nitric acid peptizea Catapal as described in Examples 1 4 with approximately 80 dry weight of Linde E 5 zeolite, a tradename of Union Carbide Corporation, having a SiO2 Al2O3 molar ration of 7.1 and a Na2O K20 A1203 molar ratio of 0.90, one sample designated as Example 31 consisting of Na mordenite, also known as Na zeolon obtained from the Norton Company having a S102 A1203 molar ratio of 11.5 and a Na2O A1203 molar ratio of 0.82 ana one sample designated as Example 32 consisting of K L zeolite prepared by pelletizing approximately 20 dry weight of nitric acia peptized Catapal as described in Examples 1 4 with approximately 80 dry weight of Linde K L zeolite, a tradename of Union Carbide Corporation, having a Si02 A1203 molar ration of 6.1 and aK20 A1203 molar ratio of 0.92 were contacted with 100 chlorine gas at the temperatures and time periods set forth in Table V.The samples designated as Comparative Examples L, M and N consisting respectively of the Na , K eronite, Na mordenite and K L zeolite prepared as aescribed above were not treated with chlorine gas. The chlorine treated samples were thereafter purged with nitrogen gas at the chlorine treatment temperatures indicated in Table V for about 10 minutes. Using the experimental procedure set forth for examples 20 29, the pertinent treatment data and prominent band positions from theI.R. spectra are set forth in Table V. Shifts in the bands to higher wave numbers in the chlorine treated materials indicate dealumination.However, in contrast with Examples 20 29, there was no sharpening of bands which indicates that stabilization had not occurred with these zeolites in their alkali cation form. COMPARATIVE EXAMPLES 0 Q For the purpose of comparison with the zeolites in Examples 20 32 two samples designated asComparative Examples 0 and P consisting of syntheticY type zeolite prepared as described in Examples 1 4 and one sample designated as Comparative Example Q consisting of synthetic large pore hydrogen mordenite obtained from the Norton Company as described in Examples 5 7 were calcined in air for 120 minutes at the temperatures indicated in Table V without treatment by chlorine gas. The pertinent data ana prominent band positions from the I.R.spectra, basea on the experimental procedure set forth for Examples 20 29, are set forth in Table V.While shirting of the bands to higher wave numbers occurred, the shift is less than that which is found for the same zeolite samples which unaerwent chlorine treatment at the same temperatures indicating less dealumination. In addition, there is no sharpening of the bands to indicate stabilization. TABLE V Treatment ConditionsExample Zeolite Time, min. Temperature, C. I.R.

EXAMPLES 33 36 AND COMPARATIVE EXAMPLES R U Two samples designatea as Examples 33 and 34 consisting of Na mordenite prepared as described in Examples 30 32 and two samples designated as Examples 35 and 36 consisting of synthetic large pore hyarogen mordenite obtained from the Norton Company as described in Examples 5 7 were contacted with 100 chlorine gas for 60 minutes at the temperatures indicated in the Table VI. The samples designated as Comparative Examples R, S, T and U consisting respectively of the Na mordenite and synthetic large pore hydrogen mordenite prepared as described above were not treated with chlorine gas.The chlorine treated samples were thereafter purged with nitrogen gas at the chlorine treatment temperatures indicated inTable VI for about 10 minutes. 5 gram samples of specified zeolites in Table VI were then Soxhlet extracted in 250 milliliters of distilled water for 2 days. The treatment data and chemical analysis data for the samples, either untreatea or treatea with chlorine, both before and after Soxhlet extraction, are set forth in Table VI. The lowering of cation content is a clear indication of aecationization resulting from chlorine treatment of the zeolite followed by boiling water extraction. The examples also aemonstrate that the major portion of retained metal chlorides can be washed out with water.

EXAMPLE 37 AND COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE V One sample designated as Example 37 consisting ot synthetic large pore hydrogen mordenite as described in Examples 5 7 and one sample designatea as comparative Example V consisting of nitric and peptized Catapal binaer as described in Examples i 4 were contacted with 100 chlorine gas for 60 minutes at 750 C. The chlorine treated samples were thereafter purged with nitrogen gas at 750 C for about 10 minutes. A light yellow solid, followed by a brown solid, were deposited in the quartz reactor downstream of the sample ana were collected by water washing and then submittea for chemical analysis with the results shown in Table VII. The results indicate that iron is one of the major components of the deposited solid, i.e., the brown solid, which is removed from the zeolite by a reaction with chlorine.These examples show that the chlorine treatment at eievated temperatures can purify zeolites by removing impurities such as iron. The other mayor components of the deposited solid are aluminum and sodium which are the reaction proaucts of framework structural aluminum and sodium with chlorine gas at elevated temperature. The results from these examples further show that tne chlorine treatment at elevatea temperatures can dealuminate and decationize zeolites. As notea, the light yellow solid consisting of AlCl3 or a mixture of AlCl3 and other metal chlorides is the reaction product ot chlorine gas with the framework aluminum. The framework aluminum is in a tetrahedral environment which can easily be changea to an octahedral environment as in the AlCi3 form. Comparative Example V using theCatapal binder alone with the aluminum already in an octahedral environment showed no yellow deposit unoer the same treatement conditions. Any aluminum detected in the reactor deposit is therefore removea only from the zeolite framework and not from theCatapal binder.

The samples designated asComparative Examples W, X, Y and Z consisting respectively of synthetic large pore hydrogen mordenite, synthetic Y type zeolite, LZ 105 andCatapal were not treated with cnlorine gas. The chlorine treated samples were thereafter purged with nitrogen gas at the chlorine treatment temperatures indicated in Table VIII for about 10 minutes.In accordance with the procedure aescribea flereinabove in regara to evaluating the catalytic character of chlorine treated zeolite proaucts, the first order rate constant for the catalytic cracking of 28 n butane in helium at 5000C after 10 minutes of reaction time was determined for all of the samples. The results are set forth in Table VIII.As is readily apparent from the foregoing data, the n butane cracking ability, and thus the acidity, of a zeolite can be altered by the chlorine treatment process of the present invention. By varying the chlorine treatment time and temperature conditions, the n butanes cracking ability using a specific zeolite can be adjusted to a desired level for a particular reaction.
