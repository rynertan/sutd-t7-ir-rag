# Metal drive V belt.

## Abstract
A metal drive V belt 46 has a pre folded portion forming a plurality of abutting drive blocks 20 . The drive blocks have longitudinally aligned lateral slots 22 in which are disposed circumferentially extending radially abutting nested continuous metal band members 34 . The metal band members maintain the drive blocks in a continuous loop. The slots have smooth radiused corners 32 to provide stress relief. The radially innermost 34a, 34b, 34c of the nested bands have a chamfer 36 formed on the inner edges thereof and a longitudinally extending locking bead 38a, 38b, 38c which mates with the next radially outer con tinuous band.
