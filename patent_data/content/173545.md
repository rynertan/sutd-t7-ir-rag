## Description
FIELD OF THE INVENTIObl This invention relates to a crystalline alumina loaded cavity resonator and to a method of making such a resonator. The resonators with which the invention is particularly concerned are those which have low losses and high frequency stability such that their frequency may be wellrdefined and only weakly perturbed by temperature, pressure and mechanical changes in the etltironment of the resonator, especially when brought to crogenic temperature below 20t K LVIN. The resonators also have capability of high power or high electric field operation.DISCUSSION OF THE PRIOR ART It is known that dielectric resonators exhibit radiation losses, see for example Richtmeyer R D 1939 J Appl Phys 10, 391 8. It has already been shown by Braginsky et al, 1981 IEEETrans Magn 17, pp 955 957 that the very low loss tangent of sapphire, the low coefficient of thermal expansion and the highYoung s modulus, makes a sapphire dielectric resonator SDR suitable as an extremely stable frequency standard. For cylindrical resonators the high dielectric constant of sapphire E 10 enables whispering gallery modes to exist, with low radiation losses and consequently high Q factors as long as the wavelength is sufficiently small compared with the radius of curvature. During the past decade several superconducting cavity stabilised oscillator SCSO systems have been developed StainS R and Turneare J P 1973 Proc 27th Annual Symposium on Frequency Control Washington, DC Elec Industries Assoc pp 414 20 Jiminez J J and Septier A 1973 Proc 27th Annual Symposium Frequency ControlWashington DC Elec Industries Assoc pp 406 13 Mann A G and Blalr D G 1983 J phys D Appl Phys 16, 105 that have exceptional frequency stability Stein S R and Turneare J P 1973 Proc 27thAnnual symposium on Frequency Control Washington DC Elec IndustriesAssoc pp. 414 20 and exceptionally low phase noise Mann A G and BlairD G 1983 J Phys D Appl Phys 16, 105 .Low phase noise is achieved by locking an external oscillator to the cavity, and then using the cavity as a high Q transmission filter, and for this application it is important to have the highest possible Q factor.Long. term freque cy,stabllity depends primarily on environmental control since temperature variations and mechanical movement are transformed into frequency variations of the resonant cavityChief limitations are the coefficient of thermal expansion of the cavity, temperature dependence of the surface reactance of the superconductor and mechanical deformations due to vibration and due to tilt variations in the presence of the earths gravitational field. The intrinsic radiation loss from dielectric resonators Richtmeyer R D 1939 J Appl Phys 105 391 8 has led to the.idea of coating a sapphire nnatnr with superconductor to obtain a high factor Strayer D M, nick G J, Tward E 1983 IEEE TransMagn 19, 512 , Although this is an elegant solution, it does not avoid problems arising from the temperature dependence and the microwave power dependence of the surface reactance Braginsky V B and Panov V I 1979 IEEE Trans Magn 15, pp 30 32 of the superconductor. The superconductor experiences the full electromagnetic field of the SDR, and power dependent Q degradation has been observed Braginsky Y G and Panov V B 1979 Private Communication .These problems can be avoided by using an uncoated SDR. Braginsky has suggested the use of a large sapphire torus to prevent radiation losses Braginsky V G, Panov V I, Tlmashov A V 1982 Sov Phys Doklady 267, 74 . However study of a 50mum diameter torus at 10 20 SHt has shown that radiation losses are still a problem with this geometry Blair D G and Vyatchanin S P 1978 Sov Phys JLl 47, 433 , while the torus is difficult to mount rigidly without introducing field perturbations and losses.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of this invention to provide a resonator with frequency stability superior to existing resonators through a system in which the magnitude of all known environmental perturbation are reduced compared with known systems. Accordingly, this invention provides a crystalline alumina loaded cavity resonator comprising a crystalline alumina dielectric resonator having at least one protrusion whereby it can be rigidly mounted inside a metallic housing such that the main body of the said crystalline alumina dielectric resonator is separated a significant distance from the inside walls of the said housing constituting an electromagnetic cavity. A preferred resonator comprises a spindle shaped sapphire dielectric resonator mounted inside and occupying some 25t of the volume of a superconducting niobium cavity.DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING A clearer understanding of this invention will be gained by a consideration of the drawing of a preferred embodiment and the further description of preferred embodiments. In the drawing there is shown a vertical section of the resonator of the invention. Turning to the drawing Numeral 1 designates a single crystal of alumina of generally cylindrical shape being a sapphire having protrusions 2 and 2 which fit closely in recesses in the base 3 and lid 3 of a niobium housing. The lid 3 can be clamped by means of the groove 4 using clamping means not shown to hold the sapphire rigidly between the lid and the base. To prevent radiation losses, an indium seal of suitable dimensions is provided whereby on clamping, the indium seals the lid 3. to the side walls 5 at groove 6 in lid 3 . One or more microwave probes 7 schematRcally shown are used to couple microwave power into the cavity through one or more holes 8The hole dimension and the probe position are designed to optimise the coupling to the resonator without degrading its performance. The body of the sapphire dielectric resonator is a cylinder 30mm diameter and 3Omm long. The protrusions 2 and 2 are about 7mn in diameter and 12mm long, and fit into recesses at the ends of the housing which is a Sonin diameter x 50mn long cylindrical niobiurn.cavity. The system is designed to have a fundamental TEoll mode at about 1 QHz, and for the SDR to be spaced about 5 scale lengths of the evanescent field from the cavity walls. This greatly reduces any perturbing ettects ot the cavity. The cylindrical symmetry is also chosen so that transverse and longitudinal vibrations or fluctuations in the position of theSDR relative to the niobium cavity will, to first order, have a null contribution to the frequency of the resonator. This property will occur so long as the particular modes of the SDR have sufficient symmetry. This requires, firstly, that the symmetry axis of the sapphire be chosen to be parallel to the resonator axis, otherwise the anisotropy of the dielectric constant will cause angular distortion of the resonator field leading to incomplete nulling of frequency fluctuations. Secondly, nulling requires that modes with sufficient symmetry are selected. In a further preferred embodiment the high Q factor and the decoupling of the microwave energy from the walls allows much higher electric fields to be generated in a sapphire loaded conducting cavity than in other configurations. By using an appropriate mode in the sapphire dielectric resonator, and by placing appropriate beam entry holes in the housing in line with a small hole in the dielectric resonator to allow penetration of a charged particle beam , it is possible to use this resonator as a high efficiency particle accelerat or element. The preferred substance from which the crystalline alumina dielectric resonator is constructed is a single crystal of sapphire but ruby or emerald may also be used. The metallic housing is preferably constructed from niobium although other high conductivity metals such as copper, silver, lead, tin and alloys and mixtures including inlermetallic compounds may be used. It Is to be noted that this invention is to be given a broad connotation and is not to be limited to the invention specifically described.
