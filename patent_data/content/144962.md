## Description
GEAR SYNCHRONIZER ASSEMBLY FOR POWER TRANSMISSON The present invention relates to a gear synchronizer assembly for power transmissions, and more particularly, but not exclusively, to a gear synchronizer mechanism of the type which comprises a gear member rotatable on a transmission shaft, a spline piece formed at one side thereof with a conical portion and thereon with external splines and mounted on a hub portion of the gear member for rotation therewith, a synchronizer ring mounted on the spline piece conical portion and cooperable with the same for frictional engagement therewith, a hub member formed thereon with external splines and fixed to the shaft for rotation therewith, a clutch sleeve encircling the hub member and having internal splines in continual engagement with the external splines of the hub member, the clutch .sleeve being axially shiftable to be engaged at the internal splines thereof with the external splines of the spline piece, and a thrust mechanism for moving the synchronizer ring toward the spline piece in shifting operation of the clutch sleeve to effect the frictional engagement between the synchronizer ring and the spline piece. In such a conventional gear synchronizer mechanism as described above, the thrust mechanism comprises a plurality of circumferentially spaced strut keys each having a raised portion in engagement with a corresponding recess in the inner peripheral wall of the clutch sleeve, and a circular retainer spring arranged to bias the strut keys radially outwardly for engagement with the clutch sleeve. To simplify the construction and manufacturing process of the thrust mechanism, an improved. thrust mechanism has been proposed in Japanese Early PatentPublications Nos. 55 100428, 58 137627, 58 163829, and 58 174724, wherein the strut keys and retainer spring are replaced with a single thrust element.It is, however, difficult to enhance productivity of the gear synchronizer mechanism because the single thrust element is complicated in its configuration and construction. It is, therefore, a primary object of the present invention to provide an improved qear synchronizer mechanism, wherein the thrust mechanism can be manufactured in a simple manner to enhance productivity of the gear synchronizer mechanism and to lower the production cost of the same. Another object of the present invention is to provide an improved gear synchronizer mechanism, having the above mentioned characteristics, wherein the thrust mechanism is constructed to enhance the durability of the clutch sleeve and to reliably prevent loosening of the meshed teeth in a shifted condition of the mechanism. According to the present invention there is provided a gear synchronizer assembly, wherein the clutch sleeve is formed at its inner periphery with an internal radial projection, and wherein the thrust mechanism comprises a radially contractible annular resilient member supported in place by engagement with the inner circumference of an outer cylindrical hub portion of the hub member, the resilient member having an axial leg extending therefrom toward the internal radial projection of the clutch sleeve and having a radial projection arranged to be brought into engagement with the internal radial projection of the clutch sleeve in shifting operation of the clutch sleeve toward the spline piece and arranged to abut against and urge the synchronizer ring toward the spline piece upon engagement with the internal radial projection of the clutch sleeve, the axial leg of the resilient member being arranged to be compressed radially inwardly by engagement with the internal radial projection of the clutch sleeve. In the gear synchronizer assembly described above, it is preferable that the clutch sleeve is formed at its inner periphery with a first internal radial projection of large width arranged to be engaged with the axial leg of the resilient member and a pair of second internal radial projections of small width located at opposite sides of the first internal radial projection, the first and second internal radial projections each being formed at one side thereof with a pair of chamfers, wherein the synchronizer ring is formed thereon with a pair of raised portions which are respectively chamfered at one end thereof to be engaged with the chamfers of the first internal radial projection, the synchronizer ring being further formed thereon with another pair of raised portions which are respectively chamfered at one end thereof to be engaged with the chamfers of the second internal radial projections. For a better understanding of the present invention, and to show how the same may be carried into effect, reference will now be made, by way of example, to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. I illustrates in cross sectional form one of circumferentially equi spaced parts of a gear synchronizer assembly according to the present invention Fig. 2 is a cross sectional view taken along lineII II in Fig. 1 Fig. 3 is a cross sectional view taken along lineIII III in Fig. 2 Fig. 4 is a partial view taken along line IV IV in Fig. 2, showing the relative positions of the clutch sleeve, the synchronizer ring and the spline piece illustrated in Figs. 1 to 3 Fig. 5 illustrates in cross sectional form one of circumferentially equi spaced parts of another embodiment of the present invention Fig. 6 is a cross sectional view taken along lineVI VI in Fig. 5 Fig. 7 is an enlarged cross sectional view taken along line VII VII in Fig. 6 Fig. 8 is an enlarged cross sectional view taken along line VIII VIII in Fig. 6 Fig. 9 is an enlarged cross sectional view taken along line IX IX in Fig. 6 and Fig. 10 is an enlarged partial view taken along line X X in Fig. 6, showing the relative positions of the clutch sleeve, the synchronizer ring and the spline piece illustrated in Figs. 5 to 9. Referring now to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals represent the same or corresponding parts throughout the figures, there is illustrated, in Fig.1, a transmission shaft 21, on which are rotatably supported a pair of change speed gears 22 and 22. Disposed between the change speed gears 22 and 22 is a pair of synchronizer assemblies which are operable to cause selective speed synchronization between the shaft 21 and the gears 22 and 22, respectively. As is illustrated inFigs. 1 and 2, the synchronizer assemblies have a common hub assembly which includes a hub member 11, and a pair of radially contractible annular resilient members 15, 15.The synchronizer assemblies are arranged to be operated through a clutch sleeve 12 which is connected by a yoke groove to a conventional mechanical shift mechanism not shown . The hub member 11 is fixed at its inner hub portion lla to the transmission shaft 21 by means of a spline connection to rotate therewith. The hub member 11 is integrally formed with an outer cylindrical hub portion llb which is formed thereon with external splines. The clutch sleeve 12 is in surrounding relationship with the outer cylindrical hub portion llb of hub member 11 and has internal splines in continual engagement with the external splines of hub member 11. The clutch sleeve 12 is axially shiftable to be engaged at the internal splines thereof with external splines 14b of a spline piece 14. The left hand synchronizer assembly is substantially the same as the right hand synchronizer assembly such that a detailed description of the right hand synchronizer assembly only is believed necessary. The right hand synchronizer assembly includes the spline piece 14 and a synchronizer ring 13. The spline piece 14 is fixedly mounted on a hub portion of change speed gear 22 by means of a spline connection to rotate therewith. The spline piece 14 is formed at its left end with a conical portion 14a and thereon with the external splines 14b which are provided with a chamfer at each end. The synchronizer ring 13 is rotatably and axially slidably mounted on the conical portion 14a of spline piece 14 and has an internal conical surface 13a for frictional engagement with the surface of the spline piece conical portion 14a. Thus, the synchronizer ring 13 cooperates with the spline piece conical portion 14a to provide a friction clutch in a well known manner. In this embodiment, the outer cylindrical hub portion llb of hub member 11 is axially recessed in its circumferentially equi spaced three portions. As can be well seen in Fig. 2, the axially recessed portions each are formed as an axial groove llc. The clutch sleeve 12 is formed at its inner periphery with circumferentially equi spaced three internal radial projections 12a which are axially movable in the axial grooves lic of hub member 11, respectively. The internal radial projections 12a of clutch sleeve 12 each are formed at their inner end corners with tapered surfaces 12b and at their side corners with chamfers 12c. The synchronizer ring 13 is formed in its outer periphery with circumferentially equi spaced three axial grooves 13g which are arranged to permit therethrough axial movement of the internal radial projections 12a, respectively.A pair of raised portions 13b forming the axial groove 13g are respectively formed at their inside corners with a chamfer 13c engageable with the corresponding chamfer 12c of the internal radial projection 12a. As is illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2, the radially contractible annular resilient member 15 includes aC letter shaped ring portion 15a which is formed at opposite ends thereof with a pair of axial legs 15b and at an intermediate portion thereof with an axial leg 15b. The ring portion l5a of resilient member 15 is formed larger in diameter than the inner circumference of outer cylindrical hub portion llb of hub member 11 and supported in place by engagement with the inner circumference of hub portion llb in the presence of a radial force imposed thereto.The axial legs 15b of resilient member 15 each extend from the ring portion 15a toward the internal radial projection 12a of clutch sleeve 12 through the axial groove 13g in synchronizer ring 13. The axial legs 15b of member 15 each are formed with a radial projection which is arranged between the inner end surface of synchronizer ring 13 and the tapared surface 12b of the internal radial projection 12a of clutch sleeve 12. see Fig. 1 When it is desired to engage the change speed gear 22 to the transmission shaft 21, the clutch sleeve 12 is shifted toward the spline piece 14.Then, the axial legs 15b of resilient member 15 are slightly moved by engagement with the tapered surfaces 12b of internal radial projections 12 at their inner shoulders such that each radial projection of axial legs 15b abuts against and urges the synchronizer ring 13 toward the spline piece 14 which will first effect frictional engagement of the internal conical surface 13a of synchronizer ring 13 and the surface of the spline piece conical portion 14a. Simultaneously, the axial movement of clutch sleeve 12 will be resisted by the balk action between the chamfers 12c of internal radial projections 12a and the chamfers 13c of synchronizer ring 13.When the thrust pressure acting on resilient member 15 exceeds a predetermined value, synchronism between the relatively rotating parts is established, and the internal radial projections 12a of clutch sleeve 12 ride over the axial legs l5b of resilient member 15 thereby compressing them radially inwardly. This permits the internal radial projections 12a of clutch sleeve 12 to pass through the axial grooves 13 of synchronizer ring 13 toward the spline piece 14. Thus, the internal splines of clutch sleeve 12 will be brought into engagement with the external splines 14b of spline piece 14 to accomplish the synchronization.Under such a condition, the ring portion 15a of resilient member 15 is compressed radially inwardly by engagement with the internal radial projections 12a to retain the clutch sleeve 12 in its shifted position. In the gear synchronizer assembly described above, it is advantageous that the radially contractible annular resilient member 15 can be formed in a simple construction particularly in combination with the arrangement of the internal radial projections 12a of clutch sleeve 12 which are axially movably disposed in the axial grooves llc of the outer cylindrical hub portion llb. It is, therefore, able to reduce the component parts so as to enhance productivity of the gear synchronizer assembly at a low cost. In Figs. 5 to 10, there is illustrated another preferred embodiment of the present invention, wherein the clutch sleeve 12 and the synchronizer ring 13 are improved in construction to enhance the durability thereof and to prevent loosening of the meshed teeth during deceleration of the vehicle. In this embodiment, the clutch sleeve 12 is formed at its inner periphery with circumferentially equi spaced three internal radial projections 112a of large width which are axially movably disposed in the axial grooves llc of hub member 11, respectively. The clutch sleeve 12 is further formed at its inner periphery with a pair of internal radial projections 112b of small width which are located at opposite sides of the respective large radial projections 112a. As is illustrated in Figs. 6, 7 and 10, the large radial projections 112a each are formed at their inner end corners with tapered surfaces 112d and at their side corners with chamfers 112e. The large radial projections 112a are respectively arranged between a pair of raised portions 13b which are integrally formed on the synchronizer ring 13 and circumferentially equi spaced. The raised portions 13b each are formed at their inner ends with a pair of chamfers 13c which are engageable with the chamfers 112e of large radial projections 112a, respectively. As is illustrated in Figs. 6, 8 and 10, the small radial projections 112b each are formed at their opposite ends with chamfers 112f.The small radial projections 112b are respectively arranged between the raised portion 13b and another raised portion 13d formed on the synchronizer ring 13 adjacent the respective raised portions 13b. The raised portions 13d each are formed at their inner ends with a chamfer 13e which is engageable with the chamfer 112f of small radial projection 112b. In this arrangement, the axial legs 15b of resilient member 15 are arranged to be engaged with the tapered surfaces 112d of large radial projections 112a of clutch sleeve 12 at their inner shoulders and to be engaged with the synchronizer ring 13 at their radial projections. The other construction and component parts are substantially the same as those in the embodiment shown in Figs. 1 to 4. In shifting operation of the clutch sleeve 12 toward the spline piece 14, the axial legs 15b of resilient member 15 are slightly moved by engagement with the tapered surfaces 112d of large radial projections 112a at their inner shoulders such that each radial projection of axial legs 15b abuts against and urges the synchronizer ring 13 toward the spline piece 14 which will effect frictional engagement of the internal conical surface 13a of synchronizer ring 13 and the surface of the spline piece conical portion 14a. Simultaneously, the axial movement of clutch sleeve 12 will be resisted by the balk action or engagement between the chamfers 112e, 112f of large and small radial projections 112a, 112b and the chamfers 13c, 13e of raised portions 13b and 13d.When the thrust pressure acting on resilient member 15 exceeds a predetermined value, synchronism between the relatively rotating parts is established, and the large radial projections 112a of clutch sleeve 12 ride over the axial legs 15b of resilient member 15 thereby compressing them radially inwardly. This permits the radial projections 112a, 112b of clutch sleeve 12 to pass through axial grooves respectively formed between the raised portions 13b and 13d of synchronizer ring 13. Thus, the internal splines of clutch sleeve 12 will be brought into engagement with the external splines 14b of spline piece 14 to accomplish the synchronization. From the above description, it will be understood that the embodiment shown in Figs. 5 to 10 is characterised by provision of the clutch sleeve 12 which is integrally formed at its inner periphery with the circumferentially equi spaced large and small radial projections 112a and 112b to be engaged at their chamfered ends 112e, 112f with the chamfers 13c, 13e of raised portions 13b and 13d on synchronizer ring 13. With this arrangement, it is advantageous that even if the number of the large radial projections 112a is reduced to form a sufficient number of internal splines on the clutch sleeve 12 for reliable power transmission, the small radial projections 112b can be formed to increase the number of engaged portions between the clutch sleeve 12 and the synchronizer ring 13 thereby to decrease the face pressure acting on the respective chamfers 112e, 112f of radial projections 112a and 112b.This serves to enhance the durability of clutch sleeve 12.
