## Description
The present invention relates to a device for penetrating a casing through sensible overburden. Sensible overburden is for instance cultural layers from earlier civilizations that can be found under the ground surface having a thickness of up to 3 m. The cultural layers are a source of knowledge for the acheologist to learn about life and human beings during earlier epoches. The cultural layers are in some countries protected by law and must not be ruined. Sensible structures are for instance walls of unhewn stone for older buildings, especially while works are going on for reinforcing the fundament or sheet piling in or adjacent to the structures. These works must be carried out very carefully if no permanent damage shall occur. From SE C 8301718 6 there are known a method and device for penetrating a casing through sensible overburden of the type specified above. However, said prior art cannot adapt the intensity of the air that is directed downwards for flushing around the drill tip. Thus, when using the method and device according to SE C 8301718 6 certain types of soil, e.g. sand, will erode too much in the area of the drill tip. This can lead to permanent damages of a sensible overburden and subsidences of buildings can also occur. The characteristics of the invention can be found in the appending claims and are explained more in detail in the following. The main characteristics of the invention are that a drilling device that is operated by compressed air is surrounded by a casing, said drilling device at its lower end being provided with adjustable exhaust channels that direct the major part of the compressed air upwards to lead it away between the drill stem and the casing together with the cuttings. Due to the fact that the exhaust channels are adjustable the intensity of the downwards towards the drill bit directed part of the compressed air can be adapted to the nature of the material that is penetrated. By jet action said part of the compressed air can be led upwards along the grooves on the side walls of the drill bit. The invention also relates to the design of these grooves having a lower narrow inlet and an upwards continuously increasing area. Said design makes it impossible for the cuttings to stick on their way upwards. A preferable embodiment of the invention is described in the following with reference to the enclosed drawings where Figure 1 discloses in section a device for overburden drilling comprising a rotating drill 1, that is surrounded by a casing 2. The lower part of the drill, i.e. the drill bit, is shown in the figures as a separate detail. The drill bit is assembled of a guiding device 11, reamer 12 and pilot bit 13. The drill also comprises an exhaust channel 14 for the compressed air operating the drill. These details are known per se. According to the invention the exhaust channel 14 is provided with a control valve 141, that opens and closes for the passing compressed air in response to increasing and decreasing resp. counter pressure from the soil in the area of the pilot bit. Above this control valve 141 there are exhaust channels 142 for the main part of the compressed air, said exhaust channels 142 being provided with valves 143 having passages whose areas are adapted to the material that the device is to penetrate. The valves 143 are accessible for exchange in order to carry out a coarse adjustment, if necessary, before starting a new drilling cycle. The minor part of the compressed air, that passes through the control valve 141 for prudent flushing around the drill tip, thereafter is sucked upwards along grooves 144 on the side walls of the drill bit through jet action from the compressed air that is rushing out directed upwards from the exhaust channels 142 through the valves 143. By having the grooves 144 designed with a narrow lower inlet and a gradually upwards increasing area, the cuttings can never stick anywhere on their way upwards and obstruct the channels. Fig. 2 discloses in section the way of the compressed air through the drill. The compressed air is with great power rushing through the exhaust channel 14 arrow 4 and is to a major extent pushed backwards by the constriction in the control valve 141. The air then continues through the upwards inclined exhaust channels 142 having valves 143 arrow B and then further upwards together with the cuttings between the drill shank and the casing arrow C . The minor part of the compressed air, that flows through the control valve 141 arrow D for prudent flushing around the drill tip, is sucked upwards along the grooves 144 in the side walls of the drill bit arrow E through jet action from the compressed air that is rushing out in an upward direction from the exhaust channels 142 through the valves 143. Fig. 3 discloses the different working phases when the casing and the drill is driven down into the overburden to a level just below the lower edge of the cultural layer. After the drill has been drawn up piling can take place through the casing without disturbing the cultured layer. Fig. 4A to 4D discloses the different working phases when the casing and the drill are driven down through a fundament of unhewn stone. The invention is of course not restricted to the above described embodiments but many modifications are possible within the scope of the appending claims.
