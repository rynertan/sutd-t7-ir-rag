# AUTOMATIC MANUAL BAIL OPENER

## Abstract
An automatic manual shuttle mechanism is used to open and close the bail mechanism which holds a print sheet against the platen roller 36 of a typewriter printer. The shuttle mechanism includes a shuttle member 218 fitted with a slot 224 . The slot rides or shuttles against a pin 246 which is mounted to the frame of the typewriter printer. The shuttle mechanism is coupled to the bail mechanism. In an automatic mode of operation, a motor crank assembly 236, 238,234, 232, 229, 230 drives the shuttle mechanism 218 . In a manual mode of operation, a manual lever 216 drives the shuttle member.
