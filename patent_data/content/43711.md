## Abstract
A valve housing 1, 15 has a valve seat 3 surrounding a fluid passageway 2 , a valve closure member 4 cooperating with the valve seat 3 to close the passageway 2 . A valve ac tuating spindle 17 for controlling the position of the valve clo sure member 4 extends through a tubular part 15 of the valve housing, the end of the tubular part 15 remote from the valve seat 3 forming itself a housing for a gland seal. The wall of the tubular part 15 at the inner end of the gland housing is displaced radially inwardly to form, within the tubular part 15 , an annular constriction 22 which surrounds the spindle 17 with a clearance and which forms an abutment towards which an annular packing 24 within the gland housing is urged by a gland 27 fitted to the outer end of the gland housing, to seal the spindle 17 to the valve housing 15 .
