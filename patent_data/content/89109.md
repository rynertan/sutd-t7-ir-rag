# Mixing apparatus.

## Abstract
Apparatus for mixing fluids comprises a housing 10 affording a substantially annular mixing chamber 15 , and an annular rotor 20 mounted for rotation in the mixing chamber, outwardly extending individual passages 19 being located in the rotor, the inlets to the passages in the rotor being disposed 55 adjacent its axis of rotation, the passages in the rotor leading from the said inlets to the periphery of the rotor 36 and emerging therethrough, the median line 152 through each passage in a plane perpendi cular to the axis of the rotor intersecting the circle around the axis of the rotor on which the inlet to the said passages lies at a point A and making a rearward angle with the radius of the rotor which passes through the said point A for that passage. An inlet chamber 49, 53 communicates with the inlets in the rotor adjacent the axis of rotation of the rotor, the inlet chamber being provided with inlet means for the fluids to be mixed. The mixing chamber has a circular outer wall 37 extending around a major proportion of its circumference with a small clearance with the periphery of the rotor.
