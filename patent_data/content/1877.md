## Description
Adhesive Composition and Process for Bonding Case A BACKGROUND OF TE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention is useful in bonding low energy plastic surfaces to each other1 for example, in construction, automotive applications, plastic fabricating, packaging, structural foam bonding1 assembly of toys, etc.The adhesive composition described herein is effective in bonding low energy plastic surfaces to each other which provides a tensile lap shear strength in excess of about 520 pounds per square inch gauge containing the following components 1 an ethylenevinyl ester copolymer 2 a tackifier selected from the following group a a rosin, b a rosin ester, c a terpene resin, d a terpene phenolic resin and e a rosin modified phenolic resin and 3 a polyethylene wax having a molecular weight of about 600 to about 3000 and a process for bonding low energy plastic surfaces to each other.2. Description of the Prior Art Ordinarily, adhesive bonding of low energy plastic surfaces to each other requires some form of surface treatment prior to application of an adhesive to obtain high bond strengths between the surfaces so contacted. Lcw energDr plastic surfaces bonded to each other without prior surface treatment, such as by relatively weak, tacky adhesives, are inadequate for many purposes such as those requiring strengths in a range in excess of several hundreds or thousands of pounds per square inch gauge of bonded area. For strong bonds involving low energy plastic surfaces, some form of surface treatment or etching is required prior to application of an adhesive. Surface pretreatment of low energy plastic surfaces, for example, involves either acid etching with sulfuric, nitric, chromic acids or mixtures thereof, or flame treatment, corona discharge treatment, treatment with plasma jets or low and high energy radiation. Adhesive compositions which may be used for bonding lowenergy plastic surfaces, but requiring surface treatment, include polysulfide rubber modified epoxies, epoxy polyamides, nitrilephenolics and polyesters. These compositions, additionally, may require long hours of post cure and or clamping at temperatures substantially higher than room temperature. Often at least two of the components of these adhesive compositions rr,ust be premixed prior to application. Consequently, a need exists for an adhesive composition and much simpler process for bonding low energy plastic surfaces to each other. In accordance with the present invention a novel hot melt adhesive composition is provided which requires minimal heating of the surfaces to be bonded together and maximum bond strength in a matter of minutes or a few hours without resort to elaborate postcuring procedures. Further, the adhesive compositIon of the present invention can be applied in its melt orm to low energy plastic surfaces 15.

Ethylene vinyl ester copolymers tat can be used herein include vinyl esters having from 2 to 4 carbon atoms. Examples of suitable ethylene vinyl ester copolymers are ethylene vinyl acetate, ethylene vinyl formate, ethylene vinyl propionate, ethylene vinyl butyrate and mixtures thereof.The copolymer can contain from about 4 to about 35 weight percent, preferably about 6 to about 28 weight percent, of a vinyl ester, and can have a melt index as measured by ASTM 1238 52T of about 0. 5 to about 200, preferably 2.0 to about 100. These copolymers can be prepared by any method generally employed in the art, for example, preparation such as that taught in U. S. Patent Nos. 2,200,429 toPerrin et al and 2, 703, 794 to Rondel. In the present invention blends1 or mixtures, of ethylene vinyl ester copolymers are sometimes used to obtain a melt index within the desired range. For example, if blends or mixtures of ethylene vinyl ester copolymers are employed, individual ethylene vinyl ester copolymers can be used even if they do not have the melt index defined above, provided the resulting mixture has a melt index within the defined range. 2 Tackifiers. As contemplated in the present invention suitable tackifiers can be selected from the group consisting of a a rosin1 b a rosin ester1 c a terpene resin, d a terpenephenolic resin and e a rosin modified phenolic resin. Tackifiers which are present in the adhesive composition serve to extend the adhesive properties of the ethylene yinyl ester copolymer. Tackifiers for use in the present invention have a softening point in the range of about 40 to about 1500C, preferably about 65 to about 1350C. Small amounts of tackifiers having a softening point of less than 40 C, or higher than 150 C can be mixed or blended with tackifiers in the desired range to give desirable results however, tackifier blends having a tackifier with a softening point of less than 40 C or higher than 150 C are not preferred in the invention as set forth.Examples of rosins and rosin esters in the hot melt system include both natural and modified rosins, such as, for example, gum rosin, wood rosin1 tall oil rosin, distilled rosin, hydrogenated rosin, dimerized rosin, disproportionated rosin1 and polymerized rosin glycerine and pentaerythritol esters of rosin1 including stabilized, hydrogenated, polymerized, disproportionated, dimerized and unmodified rosin Terpene resins1 sometimes called pólyterpene resins1 result from polymerization of terpene hydrocarbons, such as bicyclic monoterpene known as pinene, in the presence of a Friedel Crafts catalyst at moderately low temperatures. Terpene resins effective for the adhesive composition have a softening point as measured by ASTM E28 58T of from about 40 to about 135 C. Another example of a suitable terpene resin is a polymerized beta pinene.Terpene phenolic resins can include, for example, the product resulting from the condensation of bicyclic terpene1 in an acidic medium and or terpene alcohol with phenol. Rosin modified phenolic resins can include, for example, the reaction products of rosin with phenol formaldehyde condensate.Rosin and rosin esters can be prepared, for example, according to the methods described in Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Technolo, v Interscience Publishers, a Division of John Wiles Sons New York 1964 , Volume 12, pp. 139 164 terpene resins can be prepared, for example, according to the methods described in Volume 13, pp. 575596 of the same publication. Terpene phenolic resins and rosinmodified phenolic resins can be prepared. for example, according to the methods described in Organic Coating Technology, H,F. Payne,John Wiley Sons New York 1954 , Volume 1, pp. 183 184 and 168170, respectively. Polyethylene Wax. A polyethylene wax is employed to reduce the melt viscosity of the hot melt adhesive composition without appreciably decreasing the adhesive bonding. Suitable polyethylene waxes in the present invention have an average molecular weight of about 600 to about 3000, preferably about 600 to about 2500, and most preferably about 900 to about 2000. Polyethylene waxes useful in the present invention are essentially linear, that is, at least 70 percent of the molecules are linear or paraffinic preferably at least 90 percent are linear. The n paraffin or n alkane content of hydrocarbon waxes can be determined by molecular sieve adsorption of by urea adduction.The penetration or hardness of the wax at 250C is about 0.25 to about 1. 5, preferably about 0. 75 to about 1.00 as determined by ASTM D 1321.The density at 25 0C of the polyethylene wax employed in the present invention is about 0. 93 to about 0. 97, preferably about 0. 94 to about 0.96. Each of the enumerated parameters are interrelated as is readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art. Polyethylene waxes can be obtained, for example, by the low pressure polymerization of ethylene using Ziegler Catalysts. If desi ed, other components generally added to an adhesive composition for a particular purpose can also be present in an amount of about 0.1 to about 5, preferably about 0.2 to about 2, weight percent based on the weight of the final composition. An example of such an additive is an antioxidant such as butylated hydroxy toluene. For purposes of the present invention a low energy plastic surface is degined as one which has a critical surface tension tic of between about 24 to about 37 dynes cm mN m . For example, polyethylene ranges from about 25. 5 to about 36 dynes cm, and polypropylene ranges from about 24 to about 34 dynes cm. In general, the adhesive composition defined and claimed herein can have the following components in the following amounts as set forth in Table 1. Table 1 Adhesive Composition Broad Range, Preferred Range, wt wt Ethylene Vinyl Ester Copolymer 15 to 55 25 to 55 Tackifier 25 to 45 25 to 40Polyethylene Wax 5 to 55 5 to 50 The adhesive composition can be prepared in any conventional manner.Thus, for example, a preferred procedure involves the use of a so called melt mixing technique in which the wax diluent together with an antioxidant, if used, is maintained in a stirred molten state at a temperature between about 130 to about 230 C, preferably between about 140 to about 170 C, during which time the tackifier is added followed by the addition of the ethylene vinyl ester copolymer. Mixing is continued until a homogeneous mixture is obtained, approximately after about 15 minutes to about 4 hours. The adhesive composition of the present invention is used to bond low energy surfaces having a critical surface tension of about 24 to about 37 dynes per centimeter to each other. The process involves heating said surfaces which are to be bonded to each other to a temperature of at least about 50 C, preferably about 60 C to about 130 C, followed by an application of the adhesive composition of the present invention, while the adhesive is in a temperature range of about 140 to about 2400C, preferably about 160 to about 220 C, to at least one of the. surfaces. Then the surfaces are brought in contact with each other. After assembly the bond reaches maximum tensile strength in a matter of minutes or few hours. No post curing is required1 and therefore, rapid assembly and handling of assembled parts is possible. DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The invention will be further described with reference to the experimental data. The adhesive composition in the present invention were prepared as follows. A polyethylene wax, in an amount sufficient to make a 201 gram batch of adhesive, was mixed with an antioxidant, butylated hydroxy toluene. The wax antioxidant mixture was placed in a jacketed 400 ml capacity Brabender Plastlcorder and kept hot by an oil both heated to approximately 145 to about 1550C. At a slow, 50 rpm blade setting, the wax antioxidant mixture was melted and then the tackifier was added while mixing continued. Continued mixing produced a fluid wax anti oxidant tackifier mixture. An ethylene vinyl ester copolymer was added to the fluid wax antioxidant tackifier mixture in the order of high melt index copolymer followed by low melt index copolymer.Mixing was continued at a top speed setting of the blades at approximately 150 rpm for approximately 10 to about 15 minutes until homogeneity occurred, and then the speed was decreased to 100 rpm and the compositon was mixed for approximately 5 minutes. On completion of mixing, the torque generally levelled off, and the adhesive composition was ready to be poured. Total mixing time was about 15 to about 20 minutes. Low energy plastic test specimens were prepared in accordance with the following procedure. Test strips having a dimension of 1 x 3 x l 8 in, 2. 54 x 7. 5 x 0, 31 cm or 1 x 3 x 3 16 in. 2. 54 x 7. 5 x 0.47 cm were used in the preparation of tensile lap shear strength test specimens. The strips were cleaned with acetone rinse and wiped dry.The test strips two for each test specimen were then exposed to an infrared lamp to heat the surface areas to be bonded to between about 90 to about 95 C. Molten adhesive at temperatures between about 176 to about 190 C was applied as a 1 8 in. 0. 31 cm bead over a square inch 6.45 cm2 area on one of the test strips. A lap shear strength speciment was prepared immediately following application of the adhesive composition by quickly placing another strip over the adhesive with the heated side of the strip on the adhesive to provide a square inch 6.45 cm2 lap. Manual pressure was used to spread the adhesive over the bonded area. A 500 gram weight was then placed on the bonded area and left for about 5 minutes, to maintain contacts of the surfaces during initial cooling, after which it was removed. The specimen was cooled to 23 0C and excessive adhesive was removed.The specimen was stored overnight prior to testing, At least two specimens were prepared for each evaluation and the values reported as an average of the two for a given test run. The method used for testing the adhesive bond strength was the tensile lap shear method with modifications as described in U.S, Patent No. 3,393,175 at columns 2 through 3. The values for lap shear were measured by determining on an Instron the force required to break the bond0 As a modification employed herein, the rate of extension was 2 inches 5 cm per minute, The force divided by the area of the bonJ gives the lap shear in pounds per square inch. Table 2 contains a listing of various types of waxes and their characteristics employed in the preparation of the test run.

In Run 25, when the surface was 250C, the tensile lap shear strength was only 141 pounds per square inch gauge. As Run No. 24 shows, however, when the temperature of the surface was maintained at 90 0C when the adhesive was applied thereto, a tensile lap shear strength of 853 pounds per square inch gauge was obtained. Obviously, many modifications and variations of the invention as herein above set forth1 can be made without departing from the spirit and scope thereof, and therefore only such limitations should be imposed as are indicated in the appended claims.
