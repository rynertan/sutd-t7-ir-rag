# Method of forming a tyre.

## Abstract
This disclosure relates to a method for preheating and preforming a green tyre prior to final vulcanization of the tyre. The method includes the steps of supporting the beads of a green tyre between a pair of relatively cool discs to form a tightly closed space, moving the discs toward each other until the tyre has a shape substantially the same as the final tyre shape, supplying the space with a thermal medium, and heat ing the medium and the tyre to a temperature substantially lower than that at which the vulcanization starts but high enough to preform the tyre. A coolant is passed through the parts of the discs which engage the tyre beads to prevent overheating of the beads.
