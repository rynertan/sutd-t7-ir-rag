## Description
The present invention is directed to hybrid polypeptides and processes for making the same. More particularly, the invention provides processes for producing hybrid DNA sequences which can express hybrid polypeptides having novel polypeptide sequences and novel physical properties. Advances in the field of recombinant DNA technology have resulted in the cloning of various naturally occurring DNA sequences and the expression of the underlying recombinant DNA to produce biologically active recombinant polypeptides. For example, human growth hormone has been produced in Modifications of certain recombinant polypeptides have been made to investigate the properties of such modified polypeptides. To this end, naturally occurring DNA sequences have been cloned and modified by deleting or replacing amino acid residues of the naturally occurring polypeptide to modify the physical properties of the recombinant polypeptide, as for example, by site directed mutagenesis as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,518,584. Recombinant polypeptides have also been modified by fusing recombinant DNA sequences. For example, the signal sequence from a plasmid derived beta lactamase was positioned at the amino terminus of proinsulin through a common restriction site to facilitate the secretion of proinsulin 3 . Two different human alpha interferon DNA sequences have been combined by way of a common restriction site to form a DNA sequence containing sequences from alpha 1 interferon and alpha 2 interferon as described by Weissman 4 . The alpha interferons expressed by such fused alpha interferon DNA sequence, however, demonstrated limited biological activity. A major limitation in producing modified polypeptides by combining the underlying DNA at a restriction site, at more than one restriction site by way of a bridging synthetic oligonucleotide or by combining synthetic oligonucleotides to form the entire modified DNA sequence lies in the enormous amount of work which is required to produce a particular modified recombinant polypeptide. For example, such modifications require knowledge of the DNA and or polypeptide sequence which if not available must be determined. Moreover, even if such sequences are known, the task of producing a modified polypeptide is far from simple and may result in a biologically inactive molecule. Weber, The efficiency of producing modified genes and polypeptides by Schneider, We have now developed circular vectors containing replicable DNA sequences and DNA sequences encoding at least two different parental polypeptides and recombined circular vectors containing the replicable DNA sequences and a hybrid DNA sequence encoding a hybrid polypeptide corresponding to part of each parental polypeptide. We have now developed efficient processes for making such recombined circular vectors and hybrid polypeptides, as well as additional processes for isolating such recombined circular vectors. We have furthermore developed biologically active hybrid polypeptides containing segments of polypeptide sequences derived from at least two parental polypeptides, as well as biologically active hybrid enzymes such as hybrid amylases and hybrid proteases. Novel circular vectors containing a replicable DNA sequence and parental DNA sequences encoding all or part of at least two distinct parental polypeptides are disclosed. Such vectors are used in novel processes to produce recombined circular vectors containing said replicable DNA sequences and hybrid DNA sequences comprising 1 a first DNA sequence encoding the amino terminal portion of a hybrid polypeptide corresponding to a first part of a first parental polypeptide sequence and 2 a second DNA sequence encoding a carboxy terminal portion of said hybrid polypeptide corresponding to a first part of a second parental polypeptide sequence. First and second parental DNA sequences encoding all or part of a first and second parental polypeptide sequence are ligated with a replicable DNA sequence to form a circular vector wherein said parental DNA sequences are in proximity with each other. Rec positive microorganisms are transformed with the thus formed circular vector to form a cell population containing a multiplicity of said circular vector wherein crossover recombination of at least one of said circular vectors is mediated by the naturally occurring recombination mechanism of the rec positive microorganism. Such crossover recombination of the vector excises a third DNA sequence which encodes a second part of each of said first and second parental polypeptide sequences to form a recombined circular vector comprising said replicable DNA sequences and said hybrid DNA sequences which encode a first part of each of said first and second parental polypeptide sequences. Such recombined vectors may be capable of expressing novel hybrid polypeptides or may be further modified to allow such expression. A variation of the above described process utilizes a unique restriction site which is contained within said third DNA sequence. Excision of the third DNA sequence produces a recombined circular vector which no longer contains the unique restriction site. Treatment of isolated circular vector and recombined circular vector with an endonuclease specific for said unique restriction site produces linearized vector and circular recombined vector. The circular recombined vector is isolated from linearized vector by exposing a microorganism to such vectors to transform the microorganism with the recombined circular vector. A process is also disclosed wherein said third DNA sequence comprises a DNA sequence which prevents expression of the second DNA sequence. Such sequences are typically transcription termination sequences. A functional promoter sequence is operably linked to said first DNA sequence. When the third DNA sequence is excised by a rec positive microorganism hybrid polypeptide is expressed. Such expression can be used to identify transformants which contain recombined vector. This latter process can be further modified by positioning a fourth DNA sequence three prime to said second DNA sequence. This fourth DNA sequence encodes a defined selection characteristic, such as tetracycline resistance, which may be used to isolate transformants containing recombined vector which express the defined selection characteristics as a result of the excision of said third DNA sequence.

Figure 6A and 6B depict the amino acid sequence for the alpha amylases derived from Figure 7 depicts the specific activity of various hybrid alpha amylases at various temperatures. Figure 8 depicts the construction of a plasmid containing DNA sequences encoding alpha amylases from The inventor has demonstrated that novel hybrid polypeptides having unique biological activity can be produced by homologous crossover recombination of DNA sequences contained on a circular vector. Parental DNA sequences encoding all or part of at least two different polypeptides were ligated with a replicable DNA sequence to form a circular vector. The parental DNA sequences may be joined in tandem relationship whereby said sequences are in very close proximity or may be inserted at various positions within the circular vector to vary their proximity. Such variation in proximity may be useful in controlling the efficiency of recombination or may impose physical restraints which limit the regions in such parental DNA sequences wherein recombination may occur. Rec positive microorganisms transformed with the thus ligated circular vector were believed to initiate crossover recombination in regions of sequence homology between the parental DNA sequences. Recombined circular vectors were formed containing hybrid DNA sequences containing various portions of each parental DNA sequence. The point of actual crossover did not necessarily correspond to those regions of the parental DNA sequences which were homologous, such homology only being necessary to initiate crossover recombination. These hybrid DNA sequences encoded biologically active polypeptides which contained various amino terminal and carboxy terminal portions derived from each of the parental polypeptides. As used herein, a hybrid polypeptide refers to recombinant polypeptides having an amino acid sequence which is a combination of partial sequences derived from at least two parental amino acid sequences. In some of the various preferred embodiments disclosed, hybrid polypeptides contained a variable amount of the amino terminal peptide sequence derived from a specific These specific embodiments are presented by way of example and are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention. In particular, alpha amylases or alkaline proteases from sources other than those specifically disclosed may be employed in practicing the present invention. Such parental polypeptides include for example alpha amylases derived from In general, the present invention may also be used to generate hybrid polypeptides by combining amino acid sequences from related or unrelated polypeptides. Hybrid polypeptides containing related amino acid sequences may exhibit unique physical properties whereas hybrids of unrelated polypeptides may produce a bifunctional hybrid polypeptide. The only limitation in choosing parental polypeptides is functional. The underlying DNA sequences encoding each of the parental polypeptides must have sufficient sequence homology to permit Examples of various parental polypeptides which may be combined according to the present invention include plasminogen activators, growth hormones, interferons, lymphotoxins, aspartyl proteases, A hybrid DNA sequence is a DNA sequence encoding the above described hybrid polypeptides. In some disclosed embodiments such hybrid DNA sequences further include a functional promoter operably linked to said hybrid DNA sequence whereby the hybrid polypeptide encoded by the underlying hybrid DNA can be expressed. Such promoters may be the native promoter of a parent DNA sequence or may be derived from sources known to those skilled in the art and functionally inserted by well known methods to effect expression of hybrid polypeptide. In some embodiments a promoter sequence is not required to produce a hybrid DNA sequence. A promoter sequence may be introduced into such recombined vectors after recombination to enable expression of the hybrid DNA sequence. A parental DNA sequence refers to a DNA sequence encoding all or part of a particular polypeptide sequence. As disclosed herein, a first part from at least two parental DNA sequences are recombined A rec positive microorganism refers to genotypes of prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms which are capable of recombination and in particular are capable of mediating recombination of the circular vector of the present invention. Such microorganisms in general include prokaryotes such as The replicable DNA sequences which form a part of the circular vector and recombined vector of the present invention contain replication and control sequences which are derived from vector species which are compatible with the particular rec positive microorganism used to mediate As used herein, a functional promoter operably linked to a coding DNA sequence refers to a promoter sequence which controls the transcription and translation of the coding sequence. The promoter sequence is chosen so that it is functional in the microorganism chosen for expression. For example promoter sequences including ribosome binding sites derived from Lambda P Digestion of DNA refers to catalytic cleavage of the DNA with an enzyme that acts only at certain locations in the DNA. Such enzymes are called restriction enzymes, and the sites for which each is specific is called a restriction site. Partial digestion refers to incomplete digestion by a restriction enzyme, i.e., conditions are chosen that result in cleavage of some but not all of the sites for a given restriction endonuclease in a DNA substrate. The various restriction enzymes used herein are commercially available and their reaction conditions, cofactors and other requirements as established by the enzyme suppliers were used. In general, about 1 microgram of plasmid or DNA fragment is used with about 1 unit of enzyme and about 20 microliters of buffer solution. Appropriate buffers and substrate amounts with particular restriction enzymes are specified by the manufacturer. Incubation times of about one hour at 37 C are ordinarily used, but may vary in accordance with the supplier s instructions. After incubation, protein is removed by extraction with phenol and chloroform, and the digested nucleic acid is recovered from the aqueous fraction by precipitation with ethanol. Digestion with a restriction enzyme may be followed by bacterial alkaline phosphatase hydrolysis of the terminal 5 phosphates to prevent the two restriction cleaved ends of a DNA fragment from forming a closed loop that would impede insertion of another DNA fragment at the restriction site. Recovery or isolation of a given fragment of DNA from a restriction digest means separation of the digest by a polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, identification of the fragment of interest by comparison of its mobility versus that of marker DNA fragments of known molecular weight, removal of the gel section containing the desired fragment, and separation of the DNA from the gel generally by electroelution 6,7 . Ligation refers to the process of forming phosphodiester bonds between two double stranded nucleic acid fragments 8 . Unless otherwise stated, ligation was accomplished using known buffers in conditions with ten units of T4 DNA ligase ligase per 0.5 microgram of approximately equal molar amounts of the DNA fragments to be ligated. Transformation means introducing DNA in to an organism so that the DNA is replicable, either as an extrachromosomal element or chromosomal integrant. Unless otherwise stated, the method used herein for transformation of Oligonucleotides are short length single or double stranded polydeoxynucleotides which were chemically synthesized by the method of Crea Preparation of DNA from transformants means isolating plasmid DNA from microbial culture. Unless otherwise provided the alkaline SDS method was used 12 . The following specific examples are intended to illustrate more fully the nature of the present invention without acting as a limitation upon its scope. In one example of a preferred embodiment, A PstI restriction site near the 5 end of the structural DNA sequence encoding Homologous crossover recombination between the alpha amylase DNA sequence was mediated by a rec positive microorganism to form hybrid DNA sequences encoding a number of hybrid amylases derived from In an example of another embodiment, vector which had not undergone homologous crossover recombination was linearized by digestion with PstI. Vectors which had recombined to form hybrid DNA sequence encoding hybrid alpha amylases no longer contained the PstI site used to join the two alpha amylase DNA sequences. Since such PstI site was unique in the vector constructed, recombined vector resisted linearization. Such non linearized recombined vector was isolated from linearized vector by transformation of a second microorganism. In both embodiments crossover recombination initiated at homologous sequences of the Approximately 5x10³ plaques were plated onto Referring now to Fig. 3B, the The plasmid pBS42 BL was subjected to further digestions with various restriction enzymes in order to generate the restriction map depicted in Fig. 1. Various subfragments of the inserted DNA were subcloned into M13 sequencing vectors 19 in order to determine preliminary DNA sequence information by the dideoxy chain termination method 21 . Sequences near the unique KpnI site were found to be highly homologous to those of the alpha amylase gene of DNA from λ amy BS was digested with various restriction enzymes, separated on a 1 agarose gel, transferred to a nitrocellulose filter 21 , and subjected to DNA DNA hybridization 22 . The probe used was the PstI SstI fragment containing most of the coding sequences of the As depicted in Figure 3A, DNA from pBR322BS B was digested with BamHI and a 1.8 kb fragment fragment A was isolated. Plasmid pBR322BS S was doubly digested with BamHI and Sal I and a 1.8 kb fragment fragment B was isolated. Plasmid pBR322 was doubly digested with BamHI and Sal I and the larger vector fragment fragment C was isolated. Fragments A, B, and C were joined by ligation. The reaction was transformed into Referring now to Fig. 3B, the Ten ng of plasmid pBS42BSBL was used to transform In order to reduce the background of colonies containing pBS42BSBL a plasmid preparation from pBS42BSBL transformed The assumption was made that the amy colonies arose as a result of single crossover events within the pBS42BSBL plasmid between the As expected the probes all hybridized to The 14 putative hybrids showed a variety of hybridization patterns. For example hybrids 1, 2, 3, and 4 hybridized to probe 1 but not to the other more 3 probes 2 8. This indicated crossover between sequences corresponding to probes 1 and 2. In another example, hybrid 9 hybridized to probes 1 4 but not to the more 3 probes 5 9. This indicated a crossover between the sequences corresponding to probes 4 and 5. As shown in Table 1 other crossover regions were similarly identified in the remaining hybrids. In other experiments not shown hybrids with crossovers between any pair of probe regions were found although with highly variable frequencies, e.g. crossovers between probes 1 and 2 were very common about 20 whereas crossovers between probe regions 2 and 3 were quite rare about 1 . The above results indicate that the crossovers between the alpha amylase gene fragments were widely dispersed over the approximately 1.0 kb region of homology between the two genes. However, it was of interest to study this distribution in more detail. Thus we determined the DNA sequence of the hybrid genes in their crossover regions by direct sequencing of sodium hydroxide collapsed plasmids using the dideoxy chain termination method 28 . For a given hybrid, synthesis was primed using the most 3 synthetic oligonucleotide which hybridized to the hybrid. In all cases the sequences determined clearly showed the crossover loci. The crossover loci for the twelve hybrids are shown in the stippled boxes of Fig. 2A and 2B. For example, in hybrid 9 Fig. 2A the crossover occurred between bp 585 and bp 600, as indicated by the presence of sequences derived from the To purify the enzymes, the periplasmic fractions were poured over a column containing insoluble starch at 4 C which resulted in the binding of the alpha amylases to the starch. The enzymes were then eluted from the column by raising the temperature to 50 C. Starch was removed from the enzymes by gel permeation chromatography on a P 2 column Bio Rad Laboratories, Richmond, CA followed by DEAE chromatography 30 . Each of the purified alpha amylases was pure as judged by its homogeneity on SDS polyacrylamide gels. The protein concentration for each purified protein was determined by the dye binding method of Bradford 31 . The thermostabilities of the purified alpha amylases were determined as follows. Equal concentrations of the enzyme were incubated at 90 C. Aliquots were removed at various times and assayed for alpha amylase activity at 70 C using the micro Phaedabas assay. The results are shown in Fig. 5. The parental The specific activities of the parental and hybrid alpha amylases purified as described above were also determined at four different temperatures. These data are shown in Fig. 7. The parental In another preferred embodiment, hybrid alkaline proteases derived from As depicted in Figure 4 the plasmid pS168.1 44,32 containing the One ng of plasmid pBS42BSBA was used to transform In another experiment enrichment of such putative recombinants was achieved by predigestion of a plasmid preparation derived from BS42BSBA transformed The assumption was made that the alkaline protease positive colonies arose as a result of single crossover events within the pBS42BSBA plasmid between the For preliminary characterization of the hybrid proteins produced by It is evident that the hybrid enzymes fall into two basic classes. The first class, represented by hybrids 1,2,3,4 and 7 has Km s that are somewhat greater than that of either parental enzyme. The second class, represented by hybrids 6 and 8 has Km s that are intermediate between those of the parents. These results show that the hybrid alkaline proteases have varying Km s for a particular synthetic substrate and that these differ from those of the parental enzymes. It is expected that determination of Km s using other synthetic substrates would also give a range of results and might also show varying favored substrates for the various hybrid enzymes. In another preferred embodiment plasmids containing hybrid alpha amylase DNA sequences are selected by the post recombination transcription a tetracycline resistance determinant following excision of a transcription terminator as a result of homologous recombination between two parental alpha amylase DNA sequences. A functional promoter is operably linked to In order to use this method for selection of recombinant alpha amylase genes derived from the parental genes of The replication of pBR322BSBLTCS in rec A positive Although the foregoing refers to particular preferred embodiments, it will be understood that the present invention is not so limited. It will occur to those ordinarily skilled in the art that various modifications may be made to the disclosed embodiments and that such modifications are intended to be within the scope of the present invention.
