# Photoelectric docking device.

## Abstract
A photoelectric docking device for remotely positioning a first member 12 relative to a second member 10 , having a point light source 16 coupled to the first member, which is directed to focus a narrow beam of light on a photosensor 14 fixedly connected to the second member. The photosensor is responsive to the reception of light from the point light source on the first member to provide electrical outputs representa tive of the relative position of the point source with respect to the photosensor in three dimensional space 48, 50 . Means are further provided for reducing the intensity of the light source proportionally with the distance of the light source from the photosensor to prevent the photosensor from becoming saturated when in close proximity to the light source.
