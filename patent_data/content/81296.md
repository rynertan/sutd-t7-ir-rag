# Tapped optical fiber delay line.

## Abstract
A fiber optic tapped delay line is disclosed which has a number of taps 110 a ... n simultaneously fabricated in a single length of optical fiber 50 . The light output from each tap is detected by either an electronic photodetector or by an output segment of optical fiber having a lapped surface. The tapped delay line may be used as a transversal filter by summing the outputs from the taps 110 , and the frequency passband may be custom tailored by selectively weighting the outputs from individual taps 110 .
