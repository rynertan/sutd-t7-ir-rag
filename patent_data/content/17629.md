# Procedure of cleaning a rotor of a spinning unit of the open end type.

## Abstract
This cleaning procedure consisting in imparting some ultrasonic vibrations of which the frequency is a harmonic of the frequency proper to at least one mode of vibration of the groove Ib for union of fibres in the rotor I of a spinning unit, and in applying to said rotor a transducer 3 fed with current of an ultrasonic frequency by a generator 4 in such a way as to impart to the wall of said groove an energy capable of detaching the impurities lodged there so that the latter can be discharged with the help of a suction head 5 connected to a fan 6 . This procedure can be employed especially at the time when the yarn is pieced up on a spinning machine of the open end type.
