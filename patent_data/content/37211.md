# Removable pavement marking sheet material.

## Abstract
Removable pavement marking sheet material 10 incor porates a stretchable porous fibrous web 16 , such as a non woven web of randomly distributed fibers, preferably embedded in a pressure sensitive adhesive layer 15 carried on a backing 11 . The fibrous web comprises closely spaced durable weather resistant fibers and exhibits good tear strength in any direction. The complete sheet material exhibits a high tensile strength and a low residual force after stretching, i.e., a low force tending to retract the sheet mater ial back to its prestretched dimensions.
