# Method of forming a hydrophilic coating on a substrate.

## Abstract
A method of forming a hydrophilic coating on a substrate comprised of applying a hydrophilic copolymer capable of chemical reacting with a coupling agent which will promote adhesion to the substrate. A polyisocyanate coupling agent is applied to the surface from a solvent solution. In certain in stances, the copolymer and isocyanate can be simultaneously applied from a solvent solution. The resulting hydrophilic coat ing is thrombo resistant, biocompatible and stable.
