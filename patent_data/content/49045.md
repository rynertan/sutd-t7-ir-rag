# A MULTI MASTER STATION, MULTI CHANNEL DIGITAL COMMUNICATION SYSTEM WITH CHANNEL SELECTION PROVIDED AT EACH TERMINAL

## Abstract
A digital communications system includes a plu rality of master stations communicating with a plurality of terminals over a single communication line via a plu rality of duplex communication channels, a separate channel for each master station. A frequency translator is provided at each terminal permitting the terminal to selectively communicate over any of the channels. When a particular channel is selected, the terminal s transmitter is temporarily disabled to allow its receiver to be resynchronized by a signal sent out by the master station whose channel has been selected. The transmit ter is then enabled in synchronism with other terminals using the same channel.
