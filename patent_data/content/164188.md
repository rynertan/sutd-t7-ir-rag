# Improved binders for foundry cores and moulds.

## Abstract
A binder for a foundry core or mould consists of an alkali metal salt of a polybasic organic acid or of a polymerised mono basic acid, for example sodium polyacrylate, an alkaline earth metal hydroxide such as calcium hydroxyde, one or more poly valent metal oxides, preferably magnesium oxide, and calcium citrate, together with water. The mixture may also include another polyvalent metal oxide, for example zinc oxide. The in clusion of calcium citrate in the binder composition, particular ly in the presence of magnesium oxide, has been found to reduce the problem of softening back in which the strength of the core or mould interior deteriorates over storage periods of a few days due to the continued absorption of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere in damp conditions.
