# REFRIGERATION SYSTEM MONITORING AND WARNING APPARATUS

## Abstract
In a monitoring apparatus for a refrigeration system in which a food store 5 is cooled by a refrigeration plant supplying a cooler 6 , a temperature monitoring means 9 50A, 64A, 66, 70, 72 provides output signals whenever the temperature in said store exceeds a preset value, such signals being passed via a signal delay means 78 to a temperature fault indicator 84 , so that the latter becomes energised only if a said output signal persists for at least a predetermined period. A by pass circuit 166, 168, 164 enables any such output signal existing when said apparatus is first energised to by pass said signal delay means 78 . A temperature probe fault detecting circuit 64A, 66, 70, 105, 104 60A, 62 is arranged likewise to cause energisation of said temperature fault indicator 84 and of a probe fault a indicator 100 on the occurrence of a probe fault. Refrigera tion plant failure signals at 129 cause energisation of a plant failure indicator 140 , and defrost signals at 108 inhibit energisation of the temperature fault indicator 84 , and of the probe fault indicator 100 . A common visual alarm 186 responds to first alarm signals derived through a first circuit 178, 180, 184 connected to receive fault signals energising said temperature fault and plant failure indicators 84, 140 , whilst a common audible alarm 208 responds to second alarm signals derived through a second circuit 188 194, 198, 206 connected to be energised by said fault signals through differentiating circuits 92 96 154 158 . Said second alarm signals are used to modulate via 200 204 the energisation of said common visual alarm 186 , and are terminated in response to the detection of the rear edges of the said fault signals via 220, 222, 218, 216 , or by means of a manually controlled resetting circuit 210 .
