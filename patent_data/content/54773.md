# Method and device for detecting glucose concentration.

## Abstract
A method and test device for determining the glucose concentration in a test sample containing from 1 2 to 10 percent glucose are disclosed. The method and test device involve impregnating the carrier with an enzymatic testing composition which includes glucose oxidase, peroxidase and a chromogen. The carrier is subsequently impregnated with from 0.5 to 1.5 percent by weight polystyrene. Contact of the carrier with a glucose containing test sample produces a detectable response whereby the glucose concentration can be determined.
