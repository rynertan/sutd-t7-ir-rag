# TAPE RECORDER

## Abstract
A tape recorder which comprises a capstan 39 for driving a magnetic recording tape at a normal con stant speed a first motor 43 for rotating the capstan 39 , including a first rotor magnet 31 , a first rotating shaft 311 mounted to the first rotor magnet 31 and the capstan 39 coaxially, and a first stator coil 41 for applying a rotating magnetic field to the first rotor magnet 31 a first reel 40 for taking up the tape a second motor 44 for rotating the first reel 40 , includ ing a second motor magnet 32 , a second rotating shaft 321 mounted to the second rotor magnet 32 and the first reel 40 coaxially, and a second stator coil 42 for applying a rotating magnetic field to the second rotor magnet 32 a second reel 55 for supplying the tape a third motor 56 for rotating the second reel 55 , in cluding a third rotor magnet 54 , a third rotating shaft 541 mounted to the third rotor magnet 54 and the second reel 55 coaxially, and a third stator coil 49 for applying a rotating magnetic field to the third rotor magnet 54 an FG pattern 51 for producing a signal which has a frequency in accordance with a rotational frequency of the first rotor magnet 31 an output mechanism 65, 66, 67 for producing a signal which has a reference frequency and a comparator 68 for com paring outputs from the FG pattern 51 and the output mechanism 65, 66, 67 and for controlling to drive the first motor 43 at a predetermined rotational frequency.
