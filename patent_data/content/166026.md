## Description
Process for the preparation of N thiocarboxyanhydrides of amino acids The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of N thiocarboxyanhydrides of amino acid, particularly N thiocarboxyanhydride of L aspartic acid. This compound is an useful intermediate for the synthesis of Aspartame, a new sweetening agent, and generally for the synthesis of peptides, and it has been described in literature and patents. The process for the preparation of N thiocarbo xyanhydrides of amino acids is disclosed in J. Org. Chem. 36, 49 1971 in US patent No. 4,256,897 Pfizer and US patent No. 3,846,398 Merck . Such a process is usually carried out by reacting a Nethoxythiocarbonyl amino acid with a phosphorus trihalide PC13 or PBr3 in an inert organic solvent. More particularly, the N thiocarboxyanhydride of L aspartic acid is obtained by reacting N eth xythiocarbonyl aspartic acid with PBr3 or Pal3, at temperatures ranging from 0 to 250C, according to the following reaction scheme EMI1.1 wherein X C1, Br. US patent No. 4,256,897 describes such a synthe sis, claiming the use of ethyl acetate as the sol vent. However, the process above described has a serious drawback, namely the production of a series of sulphur containing by products which contaminate the obtained N ethoxythiocarbonylanhydride, giving the compound a very unpleasant odour, which is often present also in the Aspartame obtained starting from said anhydride. It has now surprisingly been found, and it is the object of the present invention, that a N thiocarboxyanhydride of L aspartic acid of high purity can be obtained in very high yields when carrying out the reaction between N ethoxythiocarbonyl aspar tic acid and phosphorus trihalide in the presence of methylterbutyl ether as the solvent. This improved process gives an anhydride comple tely free from residual unpleasant odours, which compound allows to obtain Aspartame of very high quality. The following example further illustrates the invention, without limiting it. EXAMPLE 20 Kg of N ethoxythiocarbonyl L aspartic acid were dissolved in 80 liters of methylterbutylether. The reaction mixture was cooled to a temperature of 0 t SOC and 3.2 liters of PBr3 were fastly added. The temperature was allowed to raise spontaneou sly and when it reached 250C, the L aspartic thio carbonyl anhydride started to crystallize. The reaction mixture was stirred for 30 minutes, then cooled again to O . SOC and left to stand for 15 minutes. The obtained precipitate was filtered, washed with cold methylterbutyl ether and dried at 550C, to give 14.5 kg of the compound. Yield 91.6 of the theoretical. 200C 2 101.5 C l in THF d reported in lite D rature 109 .
