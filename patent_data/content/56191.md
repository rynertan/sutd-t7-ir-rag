# Integrated injection logic.

## Abstract
An integrated injection logic having a first semi conductor region 12 of first conductivity type, a second semiconductor region 14 of second conductivity type formed in the first semiconductor region, a plurality of third semiconductor regions 20a, 20b, 20c of first conductivity type formed in the second semiconductor region, and a fourth semiconductor region 16 of second conductivity type formed in the first semiconductor region. A fifth semiconductor region 18 of second conductivity type is formed in the first semiconductor region and in the vicinity of the second semiconductor region and is connected to one 20C of the plurality of third semiconductor regions in order to eliminate mi nority carriers stored in the first semiconductor region and the second semiconductor region.
