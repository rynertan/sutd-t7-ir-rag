# DIE DRAWING PROCESS AND APPARATUS FOR PIEZOELECTRIC POLYMER FILMS AND TUBES

## Abstract
Apparatus and processes for preparing polymeric piezoelectric films of one or more layers or tubular products having a central wire core by drawing a suitable polymeric blank through either a flat or a conically tapered drawing die having associated electrical field producing means, to sim ultaneously stretch and pole the polymeric material within the die chamber.
