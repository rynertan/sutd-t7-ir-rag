## Description
LamInate The invention relates to a laminate of a light transmitting synthetic resin havIng two cover plates Which extend parallel to each other, and webs which are arranged at right angles thereto and extend parallel to each other. Such known laminates are combined with glass into a composIte material and are used, for example, for covering greenhouses. As a result of their special cross sectlon, the laminates have comparatively high ultimate stress values inspite of their thin wall thicknesses, and can be manufactured rationally in an extrusion method. It is the object of the invention to provide a laminate of the type described in the opening paragraph whIch has a high light dispersion, while the known high ultimate stress values and light transmission are maintained. According to the invention this object is achIeved in that at least one cover plate of a laminate of light transmitting synthetic resin has a structured surface. In this manner a comparatively strong light dispersion can be achieved while in particular a high compression and bending strength are maIntaIned, so that new possibilities of using the laminate are created. Since the contours of the object behind the laminate can no longer be recognized, the plate is particularly suitable for use in shower baths, advertising boards, lumlnaires, and the like. It is of particular advantage that the thickness of the plate is very small whereas the plate has nevertheless high ultimate stress values. Experience has demonstrated that inspire of the structured surface, a very high light transmission of 70 to 80 can be achieved dependent on the type of radiation source. A preferred embodIment of the invention con silts in that the structured surface is provided on the inside of the cover plate adjoining the webs. As a result of such an arrangement, the lamInate can more easily be cleaned, since the smooth surfaces present on the outside can more easily be cleaned. The said advantages of the light dispersion are maintained unrestrictedly. According to another advantageous embodiment the structured side of the cover plate is formed by a surface which is zig zag shaped. As a result of this a particularly strong light dispersion can be achIeved, in whIch an impression similar to a linear grating is formed due to a comparatively sharp separation of brighter and darker stripes. Since the incident light is scattered in many directions in a large angular range and hence the incident beam is also weakened so considerably, a cast shadow can be recognized in the prImary beam. A wide light band is formed on each side of the cast shadow. If in accordance with a further advantageous modified embodiment of the InventIon the overall thickness of the cover plate havIng a structured surface is made in a range from approximately 0.5 to 1 mm, sufficiently high ultimate stress values are obtained inspite of the incisions over the cross section recurring periodically, which values may be compared with the opposite cover plate which may be constructed to have a slIghtly smaller thickness. An advantageous further embodiment of the laminate according to the invention consists in that the structured surface of the cover plate is formed by a surface which has an undulatory form as a result of which the grating effect formed by dark and bright stripes seems to be smoother. Finally, a further embodiment of the invention is characterized in that the variation of the structured surface is irregular. A total distortion of the contours of the object to be covered is obtained from the resulting dIfferent scattering of the incident light, so that recognition is impossible. The invention will now be described in greater detail with reference to embodiments shown in the accompanying drawing, in which Figure 1 is a perspective view of a laminate formed according to the invention, Figures 2, 3 and 4 are side elevations each time of differently formed laminates in accordance with the inventIon. The laminate 1 shown in FIgure 1 is composed of two parallel extending cover plates 2, 3 and a number of likewise parallel extending webs 4. These continuously formed webs 4 extend at right angles to the two cover plates 2, 3 and are formed integrally with the cover plates 2, 3 by extrusion. The surface of the top cover plate 2 is formed to be smooth and flat, respectively, on both sides, the lower cover plate 3 having a structured surface on its inside facIng the webs 4. Said structured surface has a cross section formed in a zlg zag manner and comprises ribs extending in the longitudinal direction of the webs, respectively. The thickness d of the lower cover plate is in a range from approximately 0.5 to 1 mm. In a test, the light transmIssIon was measured and compared with a known lamInate having two smooth cover plates. As usual, the light transmission T was defined by T J Jo x 100 , wherein Jo is the incident light intensity and quantity of light, respectIvely, and J is the transmitted light intensity and quantity of iight, respectively. It was establIshed that the light transmission of the lam nave I formed according to the invention Is only at most 10 lower than in the known lamInate. In order to be able to perform, in the laboratory, accelerated weatherIng effects which are produced in synthetic resin parts by the exposure to sun light, a so called spectrotest was carried out.In this test the radiation of a Xenon high pressure burner was made equal to natural con editions by two IR filters. The light was scattered by a disk of frosted glass. The laminate according to the invention was placed at a distance of 10 cm from the disk of frosted glass, and a stern pyranometer was arranged behind the sample. A light transmission of 75.2 could be establIshed in thls spectrotest. In order to demonstrate the effect of the reduced recognition of objects behind the new laminate, a rectangular diaphragm was inserted in a projector instead of a dia slide and projected on a screen. The laminate samples were inserted Into the path of radiation at a distance of 1.5 m from the projection screen and the samples appearing on the screen were photographed. It was established that the inner structured laminate throws a cast shadow and at the same time causes a wide light band to be formed on each side of the cast shadow. The explanation for this is that a considerable part of the IncIdent light is scattered ifl many dIrectIons at a large angle. The beam of incident light is also weakened so consIderably that a cast shadow can be recognized In the primary beam. A laminate 6 shown in Figure 2 comprises an upper cover plate 7 having a smooth surface on both sides, whereas the lower cover plate 9 extending parallel thereto has a structured undulatory surface 10 on its InsIde. Both cover plates 7, 9 are connected together by mutually parallel extending webs 11. The embodiment shown In Figure 3 of a laminate 12 having cover plates 13, 14 and webs 15 comprises on the inside of the lower cover plate 14 a surface 16 which Is sawtooth shaped In cross sectIon. FIgure 4 finally shows a laminate 17 which has a structured surface 20, 21 on both inner sides of the cover plates 18, 19. The upper structured surface 20 is shaped so as to be undulatory, the lower structured surface 21 being formed irregularly.
