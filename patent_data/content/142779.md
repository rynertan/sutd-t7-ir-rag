# METHOD AND MEANS FOR AUTOMATICALLY VARIABLY CONTROLLING DISPLAY PARAMETERS

## Abstract
The display Gray level in a video display of a computer tomography system is changed at a rate which is non linearly proportional to the rate of pulses generated by a manually operated control such as a track ball thereby accelerating change in the Gray level when a large change is desired and decelerating change in the Gray level when exact positioning is desired. Control of the rate of change can be by program med computer or by hardwired logic.
