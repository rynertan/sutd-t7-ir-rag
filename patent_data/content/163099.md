## Description
HANDBAG OR POCKET PEN This present patent application relates to the field of pens, especially ball point pens, or objects used for writing of the type suitable for pockets or handbags, that is to say, of reduced size and extendible.The type of pen normally used comprises, in general, an elongated body and a protective top which fits on by friction. A barrel of ink generally called a refill is housed and held inside the body, said barrel ending in a writing point which protrudes out of the body. The top is put on to protect the point when the pen is not being used, and to prevent the ink from staining. Other types of pen have a retractable point, which serves the same purpose. Soie pens are Glade fn a reduced or pocket size. However, they are awkward to write with. In some cases the top is placed on the other end froi the point in order to extend the body and sake writing easter.Ball point pens of the above ientioned types have been produced in many different forms. They are often used as proiotional objects with advertising slogans or symbols written on the body of the pen.A dra√áback with these pior types of pen is that the top may be lost, making the pen unusable.The object of this patent application is to realize a pen or siallar article, preferably but not necessarily a ball point pen, which has a reduced size when not being used and the point is covered but which is long enough to make writing corfortable when in the open position. A further object is to realize a pen or writing object of this type which cannot lose the part protecting the point.Another object is to realize a writing object of this type which can be very easily changed fros the usable or open condition to the non usable or closed condition.Another object is to realize a writing object of this type, which has relatively spacious surfaces where writing can be added. The above listed objects have been realized in a pen comprising an extended body with longitudinal axis and a point protruding from one end of the body said pen characterized in that it also comprises a first protective element and a second protective element, which are pivoted on the body along two non coinciding axis transversal to the body s longitudinal axis.Generally said axes are skew relative to one another and together form right dihedrals. It is preferable for said first and second element to be U shaped and for the body to have a flattened shape. The arms of the first element s U are arranged against two opposite faces of the body and the arms of the second element s U against other two opposite faces of the body. In the closed condition the two elements form a cover enclosing the point of the pen in the open condition the two elements form an extension of the pen at the other end to the point.This new pen has the advantage of being very reduced in size when in the closed condition, but sufficiently extended in the open condition to make it easy to hold for writing.A further advantage is that, when in the closed condition, the point is very well protected, both for avoiding damage thereto and undesiderable contact with other objects.Another advantage is that the pen can be realized in this way with wide surfaces where writing can be added, so that it may be used for advertising.An exe plary eibediment of the invention will be described with reference to the accoipanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a front view of the pen in the closed condition Fig. 2 is a side view of the pen in the closed condition Fig. 3 is a perspective view of the pen in the closed condition Figs. 4 and 5 are a front and side view respectively of the pen in the open condition Pig. 6 is a perspective view of the pen in the open condition an intermediary condition is indicated by broken lines.A writing article according to this patent application is indicated globally by 10 in the figures and may be composed of a pencil of felt pen. However, a ball point pen is more convenient. In this description, therefore, said article is sIqly called pen , without implying that this word is binding. The pen 10 comprises a body 12 formed with a longitudinal slot not visible for housing a refill, sade up of a barrel not visible and a writing point. The latter indicated by 14 protrudes from the body of the pen when the refill is contained and held therein. In the example shown the body 12 has a basically rectangular flattened shape when viewed in cross section. However, this shape is not binding on the invention.Near the other end of the body to the point 14 two covering elements, indicated by 16 and 18 respectively, are pivoted on said body 12. Each element 16 and 18 is U or fork shaped when seen in profile. The two arms of element 16 are basically as wide as the two opposite faces of body 12, on which they are pivoted the two arms of element 18 are basically as wide as or slightly less wide than the two opposite faces of the body, on which they are pivoted.Elements 16 and 18 rotate on two axes a and b, transversal to one another and to the pen s longitudinal axis. They may be pivoted using any known method, for example, by means of pins passing thorugh the body and fixed to the arms of element 16 or 18, or by means of coaxial projecting parts which extend from the arms of element 16 or 18, and are housed in suitable slots in the body 12 in such a way that they rotate. The axis A and B are preferably skew relative to one another and such that together they form right dihedrals. The longitudinal sections of elements 16 and 18 are related to one another in such a way that the bottom parts of the two U shaped elements can be fitted one over the other when in the open condition of Fig. 6 and closed condition of Fig. 3.The body 12 of the pen may be made of plastic element 16 may also be made of plastic and element 18 may be made of plastic or Metal.In the closed condition elements 16 and 18 completely enclose the writing point 14, as seen in Fig. 3.In order to change to the open condition, it is sufficient to rotate element 18 on axis b through 1800 and then rotate element 16 on axis a through 1800. In this way the body 12 of the pen is elongated by a considerable amount Fig. 6 , such that the pen is easy to use. After use, the pen can be easily put back in the closed condition, firstly by rotating element 16 on axis a and then element 18 on axis b until the condition shown in Fig. 3 is reached, wherein the point 14 is well protected on all sides and the pen takes up a mini . of space. Means, such as projections or notches not shown may be provided for making the open and closed conditions relatively fixed, fro which the pen can however be relessed. These Means will not be described here, in as such as they are normally known to a technician in this field.Obviously variations and changes within the competence of a technician in this field lay be made to that described above for example, element 16 may be composed of two separate parts in other words it could be composed of the two arms, but not the bottom, of the U.
