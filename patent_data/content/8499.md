# Down draft carburettor.

## Abstract
A variable venturi down draft carburettor comprises a unitary casting 1 which defines an induction passage 2 , and upwardly open cavities constituting a float chamber and a recess in which a movable venturi member 15 is housed. A throttle valve 30 , main jets 12,13 and venturi members 15 are all housed wholly within the confines of the casting 1 , and the casting is covered by a single plate 40 which closes the upwardly open cavities and defines an inlet orifice 41 to the induction passage 2 . By housing the throttle valve 30 , main jets 12,13 and venturi in one unit operation of the carburettor is unaffected by variations in the cover plate 40 produced by manufacturing tolerances. Access to the interior of the carburettor is achieved by removal of the plate 40 which does not, in itself, affect the adjustment of the carburet tor. The casting preferably includes integral mountings for a vacuum motor, and or acceleration pump, and or an auto matic choke.
