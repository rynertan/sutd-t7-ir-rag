# Electrical storage systems.

## Abstract
Apparatus is described for storing electrical energy. This apparatus generally comprises a storage compartment 14 containing a storage electrode 11 comprising tin and an alkaline sulphide solution and generally the solution contains tin in soluble form and the compartment is at least partially enclosed by a membrane 13 . The apparatus generally takes the form of at least one cell and each cell may additionally include a second compartment 15 containing a second elec trode 12 and a polysulphide solution and that is separated from the storage compartment 14 by the membrane 13 . The second electrode may be a counterelectrode 12 and the second compartment may also include a semiconductor photo conversion electrode 16 electrically connected to the storage electrode 11 . There may be a plurality of storage cells positioned in a container separated by a separating member that can slide within the container, each of the cells being separated by a membrane that can compensate for volumetric variations within each of the compartments. There may be means for venting hydrogen generated in each cell. Each cell may comprise a storage compartment comprising tin electrode and an alkaline sulphide solution and closed at one end by a membrane and positioned within a second compartment comprising a polysulphide solution, a photo conversion electrode and a counterelectrode. Each cell may comprise two end discs at opposite ends and at least two bored discs that can be clamped between the end discs with a membrane held between the bored discs so as to form a compartment on each side of the membrane. There may be a plurality of cells each comprising at least two electrodes and a liquid electrolyte and positioned serially within a container and separated from one another by a separating member comprising an orifice for placing adjacent cells in fluid com munication to allow for volumetric changes in each of the cells. A battery comprising a plurality of cells may be made by inserting the cells into a container having at least one orifice and then adding electrolyte into each of the cells through the at least one orifice.
