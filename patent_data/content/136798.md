## Description
TITRE PLATE AND ASSAY KIT FOR DETECTION OF ANTIBODIES IN HUMAN SERUM AND THEIR PRODUCTION AND USEFIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates generally to the field of immunology, and more specifically, it relates to a method of producing a sensitive assay kit of long range stability for the detection of antibodies in human serum.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Recent scientific advancements have linked theHuman T cell leukemia lymphoma virus HTLV to several adult Human T cell malignancies. See, for example,Proc. Nat l Acad. Sci. U.S.A., vol. 77, Detection and isolation of type C retrovirus particles from fresh and cultured lymphocytes of a patient with cutaneous T cell lymphoma, Poiesz et al., December, 1980 and Vol. 79,Isolation and characterisation of retrovirus from cell lines of human adult T cell leukemia and its implication in the disease, Yoshida et al., March, 1982. At present, both HTLV and T cell malignancies are believed to occur at increased rates in the populations of the Carribean islands and southern Japan, although HTLV has been found in some individuals with lymphoid malignancies in this country. See, for example, Proc. Wat l Acad.Sci. U.S.A., Vol. 78, Adult T cell leukemia Antigen in an ATL cell line and detection of antibodies to the antigen in human sera, Hinuma et all, October, 1981 Science, Vol. 215, NaturalAntibodies to Human Retrovirus RTLV in a Cluster of Japanese Patients with Adult T Cell Leukemia, Robert Guroff et al, February, 198o Int. J. Cancer, Vol. 30, The Human TyPe C Retrovirus, HTLV, in Blacks From the Caribbean Region, and RelationshiP to AdultT Cell Lekemia Lympoma, Blattner et al., 1982.In addition, theETLV virus has taken on new significance with the recent discovery of antibodies to HTLV in patients suffering from acquired immune deficiency syndrome AIDS . See, for example, Science,Vol. 220, Antibodies to Cell Membrane Antigens Associated withHuman T Cell Leukemia Virus in Patients with AIDS, Essex et awl., May, 1983. Continuing research has shown that there are at least three strains of the BTLV virus, presently identified as HTLV I, sTLV II, and HTLV III.HTLV I is obtained primarily from patients with mature T cell malignancies. ETLV II has been isolated from a patient with a T cell variant of hairy cell leukemia. Science, Vol. 220, Isolation of Human T Cell Leukemia Virus in AcauiredImmune Deficiency Syndrome AIDS , Gallo et. al, 1983. Although both HTLV I and HTLV II can sometimes be found in patients withAIDS, current studies indicate that the primary cause of AIDS may be the HTLV III strain.Science, Vol. 224, Antibodies Reactive with Human T Lymphotropic Retroviruses HTLV III in the Serum ofPatients with AIDS, Sarngadharan et al, April, 1983 Science,Vol. 224, Detection, Isolation and Continuous Production of Cyto pathic Retroviruses HTLV III from Patients with AIDS and PreAIDS, Popovic et al, April, 1984 Science, Vol. 224, FrequentDetection and Isolation of Cytopathic Retroviruses HTLV III from Patients with AIDS and at Risk for AIDS, Gallo et al, April, 1984 Science, Vol. 224, Serological Analysis of a Subgroup ofHuman I Lymphotroic Retroviruses HTLV III Associated withA1DS, Schupbach et al, April, 1984.Thus, the importance of developing a rapid, accurate, and inexpensive method of screening for antibodies to HTLV antigens, such as BTLV I, HTLV II, and especially STLV III antigens in human sera, is readily apparent.It is to be understood that the term BTLV antigen refers to at least the three known strains of HTLV, i.e., HTLV I, HTLV II, andHTLV III, and any other strain which may be found to fall within the family of HTLV viruses. The presence of a virus such as HTLV I, HTLV II orHTLV III is often detected by testing for the presence of antibodies to HTLV in the patient s serum. Because a disease such asAIDS is highly infectious when transmitted through blood transfusions, as well as other means, a quick, simple and accurate test is needed to sc. een the thousands of blood samples taken each day by hospitals and blood banks across the country. Although many procedures have been developed to survey serum samples for evidence of exposure to HTLV antigens, such as radioimmunoassay and immunoflourescence, the wide spread use of most of these techniques is limited by the time and or expense required to perform them.However, it has been found that the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ELISA has the sensitivity and specificity of other procedures, yet is highly adaptable to mass screening in automation and requires little or no expensive equipment. The ELISA assay is based on the use of a covalently linked enzyme antibody conjugate in which the catalytic and immunologic activities are preserved. The enzymes used are stable, unlike radioactive labels, and are cheaper and simpler to use. To estimate the level of serum antibodies using theELISA assay, the corresponding antigens, such as HTLV Il or III antigens are adsorbed to a plastic microtiter plate. The adsorbed antigens are used to bind specific antibodies which may be present in the test serum. The specifically bound antibodies are then measured by an enzyme antibody conjugate whose antibody is specific for the imrounoglobulins tIgs which are present in the test serum. Until the present invention, the microtiter plates and reagents used to perform the ELISA assay for the detection of antibodies to HTLV antigens had to be prepared in the research laboratory only as needed because the microtiter plates and reagents could only be stored for a maximum of one to two weeks before deteriorating. Thus, researchers spent a great deal of time merely preparing the microtiter plates and reagents prior to testing. Furthermore, such short term stability rendered commercial mass production of the HTLV antigen coated plates for shipment elsewhere impossible. Also, until the present invention, researchers utilized a wet method of preparing microtiter plates for detection of antibodies toHTLV antigens. The wet plates produced by this method are totally unsuitable for shipping long distances.Since it will be necessary to run thousands of assays a day to screen for HTLV III antibodies in virtually every blood bank and hospital in the country, an assay kit which is stable for long periods of time is essential to the safety and health of all recipients of donated blood. The assay kit and method of the present invention also provide an inexpensive and accurate test which now can be made available to doctors and hospitals for widespread use to assist in the diagnosis of AIDS. The present invention provides a novel method of producing an antigen coated microtiter plate for the qualitative and quantitative detection of antibodies in human serum. The invention also provides a complete assay kit for the detection of antibodies in human serum, including a microtiter plate and lyophilized reagents.This assay kit may be used, in particular, for the detection of antibodies to HTLV I, HTLV II and HTLV III antigens in human serum and remains stable for periods of at least six months. According to the present invention an HTLV antigen coated titer plate is produced by a method which comprises a adding an aliquot of a diluted lot of HTLV antigens to the wells of a multi well titer plate b storing said titer plate for sufficient time to permit a maximum amount of said BTLV antigens to adsorb onto said titer plate c removing any unadsorbed RTLV antigens from said titer plate d stabilizing said adsorbed HTLV antigens onto said plate and e storing said titer plate in a moisture free container until ready to seal said plate. The assay kit according to the present invention includes at least one multi well microtiter plate on to which antigens have been adsorbed and fixed, preferably by the aforesaid method, one vial of lyophilized human serum containing known levels of antibodies for use as a positive control, one vial of lyophilized human serum which does not contain antibodies for use as a negative control, and one vial of lyophilized enzyme antibody conjugate for measuring the level of antibodies in a test sample of human serum.Although only the use of a multi well titer plate is described in the assay kit of the present invention, it is understood that any carrier suitable for adsorbing HTLV antigens, such as beans or tubes, can be substituted for the multi well titer plates of the present invention. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS 1 Method of Preparing And Diluting HTLV Antigens In the present invention, HTLV I, HTLV II and HTLV III antigens are derived from HTLV viral particles produced by any one of several cell lines, e.g., HUT 102, MT 2, SGO HTLV II and RTLV IIIA. See, for example, Proc. Nat l Acad. Sci. U.S.A., Vol.77, Detection and isolation of type C retrovirus particles from fresh and cultured lymphocytes of a patient with cutaneous T cell lymphoma, Poxes et al., December, 1980 Science, Vol. 217, Transformation of Human Leukocytes by Cocultivation with an Adult TCell Leukemia Virus Producer Cell Line, Yamamoto, et al., August, 1982. However, it is understood that the HTLV I, HTLV II and ETLV III antigens may be obtained from synthetically produced virus antigens or parts of virus antigens or from virus antigens which are produced using recombinant DNA techniques. The HTLV viral particles are isolated using standard techniques. For example, the media supernatant of a culture of an HT V infected cell line is gathered and concentrated until the viral particles are at a desired concentration. The viral particles are then isolated by sucrose gradient ultra centrifugation. The isolated viral particles are centrifuged and the viral particles are disrupted by resuspension in a detergent such asNonidet P40 or Triton X 100. The HTLV antigens can be used directly at this point or the HTLV antigens can be further purified by known techniques to remove any unwanted proteins which could cause undesirable nonspecific reactions with the sample test serum. The optimum dilution of each lot of purified HTLV antigen concentrate is determined by standard titration procedures.For instance, two fold dilutions of sample aliquots of each lot of HTLV antigens are made, ranging from 1 1000 to 1 64,000 fold.The dilutions are then tested by the ELISA assay against samples of human serum which have known positive or negative levels of antibodies to HTLV antigens and also against dilutions of monoclonal antibodies to HTLV antigens. The dilution of HTLV antigen concentrate is chosen which yields the desired optical density readings OD for samples containing known levels of antibodies to STLV antigens. 2 Method of Producing An RTLV Antigen Coated Microtiter Plate Upon determining the optimum dilution of HTLV antigen concentrate, an aliquot of diluted HTLV antigen concentrate is added to each well of a plastic, usually polystyrene, multi well microtiter plate. Examples of suitable plates are the Immulon 1 microtiter plate, Cat. No. 78 951 99, manufactured by DynatechLaboratories, Inc.,.900 Slaters Lane, Alexandria, Va. and the Titertech microtiter plate manufactured by Flow Laboratories,Inc., McClean, Va. The plate is allowed to stand for sufficient time to permit a maximum amount of HTLV antigens to adsorb to the plate. Each well of the microtiter plate is rinsed with deionized water to remove any excess HTLV antigens, and the plate is allowed to dry.In an alternative method of producing an HTLV antigen coated micro titer plate, this rinse step can be eliminated. When the rinse step is eliminated, the excess HTLV antigens are drawn off using standard suction techniques. A similar adsorption step is followed when suitable plastic beads or tubes are substituted for microtiter plates as carriers for the HTTV antigens. After the plates are rinsed with deionized water and allowed to dry, or after the excess antigens are drawn off, an aliquot of a reagent, such as alcohol, is added to each well cf the microtiter plate to dehydrate and fix the adsorbed HTLV antigens. The preferred reagent for dehydrating and fixing said HTLV antigens is absolute methanol. The plate is left to stand until all moisture is removed from the adsorbed HTLV antigens. Any remaining reagent is then removed, and the plate is allowed to air dry. Once dry, the plate is stored in a closed moisture free container until ready to seal. After the ETLV antigens have been adsorbed to the microtiter plate and treated in the manner described above, the plates remain stable for extended periods of time of at least six months. t3 Method of Producing Control Sera The positive control serum is obtained from human blood serum samples which are known to contain positive levels of antibodies to HTLV antigens. For safety reasons, it may be desirable to heat inactivate any infectious agents in the blood serum samples prior to further processing. The positive human serum is diluted in normal human serum before lyophilizing so that, upon reconstitution, the final concentration of lyophilized positive control serum will result in the desired absorbance reading by spectrophotometric methods for serum containing antibodies toHTLV antigens. The negative control serum is obtained from normal human serum which does not contain antibodies to ETLV antigens.The undiluted negative control serum is lyophilized and, upon reconstitution, the final dilution of negative control serum is equal to the dilution of human test serum used in the assay. 4 Components of the Assay Kit In a preferred embodiment, the complete assay kit of the present invention contains at least one plastic multi well microtiter plate to which HTLV antigens have been adsorbed and treated, one vial of lyophilized human serum containing antibodies to RTLV antigens for use as a positive control, one vialDf lyophilized human serum which does not contain antibodies to ETLV antigens for use as a negative control, and one vial of lyophilized enzyme antibody conjugate, such as horse radish peroxidase labeled or alkaline phosphatase labeled antibody to humanIgG H .
