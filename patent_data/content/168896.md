# PASSIVE DOSING DISPENSER FEATURING HIGH STRENGTH INITIAL CLEANING ACTION

## Abstract
A dispenser for cleaning and maintaining the cleanliness of a toilet of a flush toilet is provided to co dispense doses of two or more chemical solutions in response to the change in water level in the toilet tank reservoir during a flush cycle. The dispenser is to have an operational life based on an approximately predeter mined number of flush cycles and includes a first internal reservoir containing a quantity of soluble solid state first chemical sufficient to provide a saturated dose of first chemical cleaning solution in response to each flush cycle throughout the opera tional life of the dispenser to thereby maintain bowl cleanliness. A second internal reservoir is also provided which contains a quantity of soluble solid state second chemical sufficient to provide a saturated dose of second chemical cleaning solution in response to each flush cycle only during an initial minor portion of the operational life of the dispenser thereby providing additional concentration of chemicals within the toilet bowl to facilitate loosening of established organic soil deposits on contacting toilet bowl surfaces. Both the first and second internal reservoirs include dispensing passageways for conveying the respective doses of chemical solutions to the water in the toilet tank in response to water level change therewithin during a flush cycle. Both reservoirs also include air vents and means to provide isolation of the respective chemical solutions from the toilet tank reservoir water during quiescent periods.
