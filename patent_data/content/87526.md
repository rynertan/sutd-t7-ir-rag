## Description
POLYMER IC MATER I AL CONTAINING RANDOMLY DISTRIBUTED HYDROXYL GROUPS FROM POLYMERS AND COPOLYMERS OF CONJUGATED DIENES, PROCESS FOR THE PEEPARATION THEREOF, AND USE THEREOF This invention relates to a process for the preparation of polymeric material containing randomly distributed pendant hydroxyl groups by chemical modification of polymers or copolymers of 1,3 conjugated dines, to polymeric material produced by this process, and to the use of such polymeric material for reaction with a co reactive multifunctional substance. It is known that it is possible to prepare polymers and copolymers of 1,3 conjugated dienes especially butadiene or isoprene containing reactive functional groups, and then to react these functional groups with co reactive multifunctional substances in order to produce a variety of useful compositions having diverse properties. The hydroxyl group is a typical reactive functional group and, for example, a hydroxyl containing butadiene polymer may be reacted with a suitable diisocyanate, this being an example of one class of co reactie multifunctional substances, in order to produce rubbers, sealants, adhesives, caulking materials, surface coating compositions, casting compositions, etc. This art is of particular interest ere the hydroxyl cont aini ng diene polymer or copolymer is sufficiently low molecular weight to be liquid, since solid and products of the kind mentioned above may then be formed using liquid mixture in the absence of substantial quantities of organic solvents or diluents, with consequent advantages in ease of handling and with respect to raw material costs and environmental Considel a tions.However, if the presence of inert organic solvents or diluents can be tolerate in the starting materials, or if the conditions of use facilitate removal of the solvent or diluent from the end product by olatilisation or by other means, then there is no reason in principle why higher molecular weight polymers should not also be ersploSed containing the said reactive functional groups. It is possible to prepare copolymers of butadiene containing randomly distributed pendant hydroxyl groups by copolymerisation of mixtures containing butadiene and a hydroxy monomer, such as a hydroxyalkyl acrylate or hdroxalkl methacrylate. In the present state of knowledge, such a copolymerisation is feasible utilising only a free radical polymerisation mechanism.Although random copolymers of high molecular weight can be prepared readily in aqueous emulsion by this mechanism, it is troublesome to avoid the formation of cross linked and insoluble products at high values of conversion of monomers to copolymer. Further, the recovery of the polymer and its purification by the removal of water, unreacted monomers, by products and of other extraneous components of the reaction mixture, the presence of which would impair the efficiency of the reaction between hydroxyl groups in the copolymer and a co reactive substance, require troublesome and expensive measures.The same mechanism of polymerisation does not lend itself as readily to the preparation of low molecular weight copolymers of butadiene by polymerisation in aqueous emulsion, since large proportions of chain transfer agents are necessary for molecular weight control. Low molecular weight random copolymers can be prepared by polymerisation in organic solvents, but the removal of solvent and purification of the copolymer are again tedious operations. It is also possible to utilise the free radical polymerisation mechanism to prepare polymers and copolymers of dienes containing terminal hydroxy groups, for example, by employing hydrogen peroxide as initiator, and by providing reaction conditiuns under which polymeric radicals terminate by mutual combination. Low molecular weight, i.e., liquid, polymers and copolymers of butadiene containing terminal hydroxyl groups are articles of commerce, having been prepared by polymerisation using substantial quantities of hydrogen peroxide in essentially a bulk or solution polymerisation process.This method of preparation suffers from other drawbacks and difficulties, notably the requirements of high temperature and high pressure during polymerisation and incomplete conversion to polymer, in addition to the nc ed for a complicated recovers stage. An anionic polymerisation mechanism has also been used to prepare butadiene polymers containing terminal hydroxyl groups, especially liquid polymers. This method avoids many of the difficulties of the free radical mechanism mentioned above, and offers the advantages of obtaining stricter di functional ity and a narrower molecular weight distribution. Other difficulties manifest themselves, however, notably the need to use specially, synthesised difunctional metal organic initiators, and the tendency for the reaction mixture to set to a solid intractable mass upon the addition of alkylene oxide to cap the terminal polymeric carbanions, however lo their molecular weight.Furthermore, since the molecular weight of the polymer is inversely proportional to the alliount of initiator used, rather large quantities of expensive initiator are required in order to produce low molecular weight liquid polymers. Reviews of this chelllislrx are to be found in the journal Rul,ber Chemistry and Tecllnolog 1969, Vol. 42, pp.71 et seq., author D. h French and in the book polymer Chemistry of Synthetic Elastomr rs , published by Intcrcience Publishers in 1969, Part 2 Chapter 9. In addition to the difficulties of molecular weight control, already touched upon, effective control of the microstructure of diene polymers or copolymers is highly dependent upon the reaction mechanism, i.e., whether irec radical, cationic or anionic. In the last case, the nature of the metallic cation and the polarity of the polymerisation environment also exert a critical effect on tie mielostructure. It is a very desirable facility to be able to retain freedom to select the microstructure as well as the molecular weight of the hydroxylcontaining diene polymer or copolymer in order to achic ve optimum results in the end use. Although there may exist certain end uses for polymers and copolymers of butadiene in which the presence of terminal functional groups, rather than of randoml distributed pendant functional groups, is essential, nexertheless, in many end uses the availability of random functional groups for further reaction is perfectly satisfactory for the purposes of attainment of good physical properties. It is an object of the invention to provide a process for the introduction of randomly located pendant hydroxyl groups into a wide variety of polymers and copolymers of 1,3 conjugated dienes especially butadiene and isoprene. Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of a polymeric material containing randomly distributed hydroxyl groups, wherein the half ester of the adduct of maleic anhydride to a polymer or copolymer of a 1,3 conjugated diene is subjected to imidation with a primary amine of the general formula H2N A OH H where A is an organic radical containing from 1 to 20 carbon atoms and n is an integer of from 1 to 3. The present invention is also a polymeric material prepared by the process just indicated and the use of the polymeric material for reaction with a co reactive multifunctional substance, such as a diisocyanate. The starting polymer or copolymer may have been prepared previously by any convenient and economic process chosen to result in a polymer or copolymer which processes the desired mean molecular weight, distribution of molecular weights, constituion and micro structure, whereby the proportion of hydroxyl groups subsequently introduced is capable of wide variation according to the properties required in the end use. The reaction of a carboxylic acid anhydride with a primary amine to form a cyclic imide is well knout and is referred to as imidation in this specification.This reaction proceeds readily to a good yield of imide, provided that other structures also reactive with primary amines are not also present such as the unsaturated carbon carbon bond in maleic anhydride itself which is susceptible to Michael addition . It is also known that if the primary amine also contains one or more hgdroxy groups, then, in the absence of otlic groups reactive with hydroxyl, hrdrox substituted cyclic iini des may be prepared in good yield. If it is attempted to react a priiary amino group in an amino alcohol with the reaction product formed b adducting maleic anydride to the hydrocarbon chain of a polymer or copolymer of a 1,3 conjugated diene termed a maleic adduct in this specification hereinafter, for convenience , in order to form a hydroxy si bstituted cyclic imide of the polymer or Coliolxnler, a freeluent result is gelation prcm .ature ross l inking into an insoluble network structure . It is surmised that the amino groups and the hydroxyl groups exhibit similar reactivities towards the anhydride groups.Thus this teaching of classical organic chemistry would tend to failure if applied to an attempt to form pendant hydroxyl containing diene polymers or copolymers. It has been disclosed in British PatentSpecification o. 1,540,101 that water soluble compositions maybe prepared by a sequence of reactions involving, inter alia, maleic adducts of polymers or enpolywiers of 1,3 dienes having a molecular weight of up to 30,000 ith a primary tertiary diamine. There relay a so be present optionally a primary amine containing al coiiol groups the reaction product should contain per 100g. from 0.05 to 0.5 mole of combined diamine and up to 0.2 mole of combined amino alcohol e.g. p.3 line 16 to p.4 line 21 . Combination of primary amino groups should occur by formation of cyclic imide groups.From the Examples it is evident that ere an amino alcohol is required to be present during redaction, it should be used in a minor molar proportion relative to the primary tertiary diamine. In Example 10, for example, 1,000g. of the maleic adduct of a polybutadiene were reacted with 91.3g. dimethylaminoproplyamine 0.9 mo e approximately and 21.sag. monoethanolamine 0.36 mole approximately .From the proportion of maleic anhydride used assuming complete adduction and from the stated number average molecular weight of the polybutadiene, it can readily be calculated that on average a maximum of only about 0.8 mel ar equivalents of hydroxyl group would be introduced thereby into each ole of polybutadiene initially used. Such a proportion would not be sufficient for the preparation of useful compositions by reacting the hydroxyl uont ai ni ng polymer with co reactive multifunctional substances, and the disclosure of that specification contains no such proposal. The polymer or copolymer into which pendant hydroxyl groups are introduced by the present process is referabl derived from 1 , 3 butadiene and or 2 methyl1,3 butadiene isoprene . Any known method may be used for the preparation of the polymer or copolymer. If it is normally solid, i.e., of relatively high mean molecular weight, greater than about 20,000, it should be substantially completely soluble in solvents which are inert during the reactions necessary to the present process, preferably in hydrocarbon solvents. As for liquid polybutadienes, any of the sources cited may be consulted for general methods of preparation, or the review by A.R. Luxton in Rubber Chemistry and Technology , 1981, Vol. 54 pp.596 et seq.The mean molecular weight of the diene polymer or copolymer is preferably within the range 800 to 200,000, more preferably 1,000 to 50,000. If a copolymer is employed, any copolymerised units which are not hydrocarbon in nature should be inert during the reactions necessary to the process of the invention and b nature and proportion they should not hinder solution of the copolymer in inert solvents, should such a measure be necessary. The conditions for the formation of the maleic adduct are conventional, and reference may be made to the last to sources cited for descriptions of tpical procedures. The proportion of maleic anhydride to be adducted is selected in dependance upon the properties required of the composition in the end use and on such considerations during the prior processing as viscosity, avoidance of gelation, speed of reaction etc. It may be assumed that virtually all the maleic anhydride used can be caused to adduct, and that virtually every maleic anhy dri de resi due will subsequently rcsul t i n i mi de formation. With this assumption,, as a guide, and i th knowl edge of the mean molecular wei ght of the dicne lrOl ller or copolymer the amount of m leic anhydride used should preciably correspond to a proportion within the range from about 1.5 to about 10 moles per mole of polymer or copolymer initially present. Greater or lesser proportions may be used, however, if called for by the end use. For example, the broader the molecular weight distribution of the polymer or copolymer, the greater will be the proportion of maleic anhydride used in order to provide the required degree of reactivity with the co reactive multifunctional substance.It must be kept in mind that the maleic adduct will always exhibit a greater viscosity than that of the original diene polymer or copolymer, which increase in viscosity will be more or less sex ere depending upon the molecular weight of the latter, the proportion of maleic anhydride adducted, etc. After the maleic adduct has been formed, it is then haGf esterified with one or more primary, secondary or tertiary monohydric alcohols containing up to 8 carbon atoms. The conditions for this reaction must be such as to ensure that all the anhydride residue are converted to half ester groups. The procedures necessary are those known to organic chemistry requiring the use of a stoichiometric excess of alcohol if necessary, the application of heat, extension of the reaction time, use of an esterification catalyst such as a tertiary organic amine etc. Any alcohol may be selected which is sufficiently reactive and which contains up to about 8 carbon atoms, and the alcohol may be used alone or in admixture with one or more other such alcohols.It should be borne in mind that in the next step of the process, namely imidation, the alcohol is re generated as one of the by products, the other being ater. These by products together with any stoichiollletric excess of alcohol iaiist be removed afie alds from the reaction product, because they would also interact with the co reactive multifunctional substance. Since it is highly convenient to remove the by products by evaporation, the alcohol or alcohols used for half esterification of the maleic adduct should be reasonably volatile, and accordingly it is preferred to use simple aliphatic alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, the propanols and the butanols.Although methanol may be used successfully, some care is required during the imidation reaction and during subsequent removal of by products by volatilisation, due to a tendency towards foaming. In the next process step, in which the present invention resides, the half ester of the maleic adduct is reacted with a stoichiometric proportion, or with a slight stoichiometric excess, of one or more primary organic amines which contain at least one hydroxyl group and the structure of which can be represented by the general formula H2N A OH n, wherein A is an organic radical such as a hydrocarbyl radical and contains from 1 to 20 carbon atoms and wherein the value of n is from 1 to 3. Examples of such substances are monoalkanolamines, such as monomethanolamine, monoethano amine, the monopropanolamines and the monoLutanolamines. This reaction, which is imidation of the halfester groups, is carried out by adding the amine at a temperature of from 100 to 150 C. and raising the temperature to about 150 C. in order to complete imidation. Typically, the addition is commenced at a reaction temperature of 110 C. which is gradually raised to 1500C. while distilling out the low boiling by products.In any case the by products are finally removed from the product of the reaction, preferably by evaporation under vacuum. The invention will now be illustrated bS the following owing Exalples. EXAMPLE 1 A mixture of 3120 g. of a liquid polybutadiene known as Lithne PJI obtainable from Reverted ChemicalsLimited, Lithene is a registered Trade Mark having a number average molecular height of about 1300 g. mole 1, a broad molecular weight distribution, a viscosity of 0O.G6 Pa.s. 25 C and a microstructure of about 45s vinyl l,2 34 trans 1,4 and 21 cis 1,4 configuration 94g. xylene 15.6 g of tris nonylphenyl phosphite sold byUniroyal Limited under the registered Trade Mark Polygard and 468 g. maleic anhydride was charged to a reaction vessel. The mixture was heated with stirring and the temperature raised to 190 C. within about 1 hour while refluxing and maintaining an inert gas atmosphere.The reaction mixture was then heated for 5 hours more at 190 C. The batch was cooled to room temperature to give a pale yellow maleinised polybutadiene, being the maleic adduct of polybutadiene and having a viscosity of 14.5 Pa.s. 25 C. EXAMPLE 1A not according to the invention 100g. of the maleinised polybutadiene prepared in Example 1 were mixed at room temperature with 7.6 g. ethanolamine. The mixture became warm and rapidly gave a thick gel.EXAMPLE 1B not according to the invention 100g. of the maleinised polybutadiene prepared in Example 1 were diluted at room temperature with 50g. xylene. 7.6g. ethanolamine were then stirred into the mixture. The mixture became warm and rapidly gave a thick gel.EXAMPLE 1C not according to the invention 200g. of the maleinised polybutadiene prepared in Example 1 were diluted with 40g. of 2 n butoxyethanol at room temperature and 15.3g. ethanolamine were then stirred into the mixture. The mixture became warm and rapidly gave a thick gel.EXAMPLE 1D not according to the invention lOOg. of the maleinised polybutadiene prepared in Example 1 were mixed with 4.3g. methanol at room temperature. 7.6g. ethanbl amine were then stirred into the reaction mixture. The mixture became warm and rapidly gave. a thick gel. EXAMPLE lE 1,000g. of the maleinised y olybutadiene prepared in Example 1 were mixed with 42.6g. rethanol in a reaction vessel equipped with a stirrer, a reflux condenser and an inert gas atmosphere. The mixture was heated and the tcmperature raised to 80 C. over a period of about 0 5 hour and was then heated for three hours more at 80 C. thereby forming a half ester of the adduct with methanol. The mixture was then heated to 150 C. over a period of about 0.5 hour and 76.4g. of ethanolamine were added dropwise at 150 C. over about 0.5 hour. The addition of the amine caused a solvent reflux which caused the maximum reaction mixture temperature that could be obtained to fall to about 120 130 C. The apparatus was altered to permit distillation and the reaction mixture was heated in such a way that lo boiling fractions were distilled out until a reaction temperature of 1500C. was again obtained. The reaction mixture was then heated for three hours more at l500C. There were no signs of any gelation occurring throughout those operations. The reaction mixture was cooled to a temperature of 100 C. and 120g. of toluene ere added. Toluene, together with the water and methanol released by the imidation process, were distil led out of the reaction mixture under vacuum. A golden yellow, hydroxy functional ised polybutadiene was obi ai ned. The hydroxy polybutadiene had a viscosity of 130 Pa.s. 250C. , a hydroxy content of 1.25 milli equivalents per gram, a residual toluene content of 0.33 wt and a residual ethanolamine content of 0.08 wt .The hydroxy functionalised nature of the polymer prepared in this Example was demonstrated by mixing 25g. of the polymer with 2.66g. toluene diisocyanate and 0.027g.1,4 diazabicyclo 2.2.2 octane. The mixture was left at 50 C. overnight after which time it had cured to give a golden yellow, hard, rubbery material having a slight residual surface tack. In the above Examples, gelation occurred when the maleic anhydride residues in the maleic adduct were either completely unesterified 1A, 1B , or were insufficiently half esterified 1C, 1D . When care was taken to ensure that half esterification of all available anhydride groups occurred 1E , by attention to the reaction conditions and en using the same stoichiometric proportion of alcohol to anhydride groups 1 1 molar as in 1D, then the subsequent imidation reaction was successful without the occurrence of gelatin. EXAMPLE 2 A mixture of 3. 120g. of a liquid polybutadiene known as Lithene N4 5,000 and having a number average molecular weight of about 5,000g. mole 1, a narrow molecular weight distribution, a viscosity of 3.5 Pa.s. 25 C and a microstructure of about 16 vinyl i, 2, 52 trans 1,4 and 29 cis 1,4 configuration 94g. xylene 15.6g. Polygard and 156g. maleic ndide was charged to a reaction x c ssel The mixture ws heated with stirring to 190 C. within about 1 hour shile refluxing and maintaining an inert gas atmosphere. The reaction mixture was then heated for five hours more at 1900C.The batch was allowed to cool to room temperature lo give a pale yel low maleinised polybutadiene , being the the maleic adduct of polybutadiene and having a viscosity of 7.3 Pa.s. 250C . EXAMPLE 2A not according to the invention 50g. of the maleinised polybutadiene prepared inExample 2 were mixed at room temperature with 1.48g.ethanolamine. The mixture rapidly became warm and gave a tough gel.EXAMPLE 2B not according to the invention 50g. of the maleinised polybutadiene prepared inExample 2 were mixed with 1 82g 3 amino 1 propanol.The mixture rapidly became warm and gave a tough gel.EXAMPLE 2C not according to the invention 50g. of the maleinised polybutadiene prepared in Example 2 were mixed ith 1.56g. methanol at room temperature. 1.48g. ethanolamine ere then stirred into the reaction mixture. The mixture thickened considerably to give a nearly gelled product and consequently became very difficult to stir.EXAMPLE 2D 100g. of the maleinised polybutadiene prepared in Example 2 ere mixed with 3.11g. methanol in a reaction vessel equipped with a stirrer, a reflux condenser and an inert gas atmosphere. The reaction mixture was heated to 1500C. over a period of about 0.5 hour, thereby to half esterify the adduct with the methanol. 2.96g. ethanolamine were added dropwise at 150 C.over about 0.5 hour. The reaction mixture was then heated at 1500C. for three hours. In this Example it was not necessary to distil out low boiling fractions in order to obtain a reaction temperature of 150 C., as was the case in Example 1E. There were not signs of any gelation occurring throughout these operations. The reaction temperature was reduced to 1000C and lOg. of toluene were added. Toluene, together with the water and r l tllanol released by the imidation process, were distilled out of the reaction mixture under vacuum.A golden yellow, hydroxy functionalised polybutdiene was obtained. The hydroxy polybutadiene had a viscosity of 34 Pa.s. 25 C , a hydroxy content of 0.47 milliequivalents per gram, a residual toluene content of 0.24 wt and a residual ethanolamine content of less than 0.01 t . The hxdroxy functionalised nature of the polymer prepared in this Example was demonstrated by mixing 25g. of the polymer with 1.03g. toluene diisocyanate and 0.0103g. 1,4 diazabicyclo 2.2.2 octane.The mixture was left at 50 C. overnight after which time it had cured 10 give a golden yellow, soft, rubbery material free of surface tack. In Example 2, the anhydride content of the maleic adduct was reduced compared with Example 1 about 0.49 m.mole anhydride equivalents per g. adduct, compared with about 1.33 . In Examples 2A and 2B esterification was not attempted and gelation occurred on reaction with the aminoalcohol. In Example 2C a one molar excess of methanol was used but the conditions were evidently inadequate for half esterification to take place, since gelation occurred. In Example 2D, 2 moles of methanol were again used per anhydride residue in the maleic adduct, and heat was applied to ensure llalf esterificalion. In idation took place subsequently without the occurrence of gelation. EXAMPLE 3 A mixture of 1,500 g. of the same liquid polybutadiene knows as Lithe ne M 5,000 as that used inExample 2 75 g . xylene 7.5g. Polygard and 129g.maleic anhydride was charged to a reaction vessel. The mixture vas heated with th stirring to 1900C. within about 1 hour while refluxing and p aintaini ng an inert gas at mosphere. The reaction mixture was then hcated for 5 hours more at 190 C. The batch was allowed to cool to room temperature to give a pa e yellow maleinised polybutadiene being, the maleic adduct of polybutadiene and having a viscosity of 20.5 Pa.s. 250C .EXAMPLE 3A not according to the invention 50g. of the maleinised polybutadiene of Example 3 were mixed at room temperature with 2.46g. ethanolamine.The mixture became warm and rapidly gave a thick gel.EXAMPLE 3B not according to the invention SOg. of the maleinised polbutadiene of Example 3 were mixed with 2.59g. of methanol at room temperature.2.46g. of ethanolamine ere then stirred into the mixture. The reaction mixture became warm and rapidly gave a thick gel. EXA. LE 3C not according to the invention 200g. of the maleinised polybutadiene of Example 3 were mixed with 5.17g. of methanol in the reaction vessel equipped with a stirrer, reflux condenser and an inert gas atmosphere. The reaction mixture was heated to 150 C. over about 0.5 hour. 9.86g. of ethanolamine were added dropwise at 150 C. over about 0.5 hour. The reaction mixture gelled during the addition of the amine and became impossible to stir. EXABlPLE 3D 85gig. of the maleinised polybutadiene of Example 3 were mixed with 42.24g. of methanol in a reaction vessel equipped with a stirrer, reflux condenser and an inert gas atmosphere. The reaction mixture was heated for three hours at 80 C. and was then heated to 1500C.over about 0.5 hour. 42.26g. of ethanolamine were then added dropwise at 150 C. over about 0.5 hour. As was observed in Example 1E, the addition of amine gave a solvent reflux and lo boil nag fractions ere distilled out in such a way as to obtain a reaction tel,lpelature at 1500C. The reaction mixture was then heated for three hours at 150 C. There were no signs of any gelation occurring throughout these operations. The reaction mixture was cooled to 100 C. and 85g. of toluene ere added. Toluene, together with the water and methanol released by the imidation process, were distilled out of the reaction mixture under vacuum. A golden yellow, hydroxy functional i sed polybutadiene was obtained. The hydroxy polybutadiene had a viscosity of 117 Pa.s. 250C. , a hydroxy content of 0.6 milli cqui valents per gram, a residual toluene content of 0.41 wt and a residual ethanolamine content of 0.08 wt . The hydroxy functionalised nature of the polymer prepared in this Example was demonstrated by mixing 25g. of the polymer with 1.57g. toluene diisocyanate and 0.0157g. 1,4 diazabics clo 2.2.2 octane. The mixture as left at 50 C. overnight after which time it had cured to give a golden yellow, hard, rubbery material free of surface tack. In these Examples, gelation occurred when the maleic adduct was reacted directly with ethanoGamine 3A and when the maleic adduct was first treated with 2 stoichiometric equivalents of methanol in an atiempt to effect half esterification at room temperature 3B before addition of ethanolamine and when the maleic adduct was first heated with a stoichiometric equivalent of methanol for 0.5 hour at 150 C. 3C . When care was taken to ensure half esterification was complete before imidation 3D , by reaction with 2 stoichiometric equivalents of methanol for 3 hours at 80 C. and 0.5 hour at 1500C., no gelation occurred. In Experiments 7E and 2D te analytical result indicated a value of hyxdroxyl content after imidation very nearly the sane as the iheoretical value assuming complete abduction of a l the maleic anhydride used and complete imidation of the anhydride groups. In Experiment 3D the analytical value was about 75 of the theoretically derived value.EXAMPLE 4 A mixture of 3,120g. of the same liquid polybutadiene known as Lithene N4 5,000 as that used inExample 2 156g. xylene 1,57g. diphenyl p phenylenediamine sold by Vulnax International Limited under the registeredTrade Mark Pelmanax DPPD and 269g. of maleic anhydride were charged to a reaction vessel. The mixture was heated with stirring to 1900C. within about 1 hour while refluxing and maintaing an inert gas atmosphere.The reaction mixture was then heated for a period of 5 hours at 1900C. The batch was allowed to cool to room temperature to give a pale broom maleinised polybutadiene, being the maleic adduct of polybutadiene o and having a viscosity of 11.9 Pa.s. 25 C . 176g. of methanol ere added to the maleinised polymer batch at 60 to 80 C. and the mixture was then heated for 2 hours at 70 to 80 C. using the same apparatus as for the maleinisation stage. The mixture was then heated to 100 C. over about 10 minutes and 167g. of ethanolamine ere added dropwise at 100 C. over about 0.5 hour. The reaction mixture was then heated to 150 C., over about 2 hours. As was observed in Example 1E, the addition of amine caused a solvent reflux and low boiling fractions were distilled out so as to obtain a reaction temperature of 150 C. The reaction mixture was then heated for three hours at 150 C.Throughout these operations there ere no signs of any gelation occurring. The reaction mixture was cooled to 1000C. and 312g. of toluene were added. Tolue, together with the water and methanol released by the imidation process, were distilled out of the reaction mixture under vacuum. A brown, hydroxy functioaljsd polSbutadiene was obtained. The hydroxy polybutadiene had a viscosity of 50 Pa.s. 250CO, a hydroxy content of O.G milliequivalents per gram, a residual toluene content of 0.2 wt and a residual ethanolamine content of about 0.01 wt Sc. The hydroxy functionalised nature of the polymer prepared in this Example was demonstrated by mixing 25g. of the polymer with 1.41g. toluene diisocyanate and 0.0141g. 1,4 diazabicyclo 2.2.2 octane. The mixture was left at 50 C. overnight after which time it had cured to give a rubbery aterial free of surface tack. EXt I,E 5 350g. of maleinised polymer, prepared as described in Example 4, and 24g. of n butanol were charged to a reaction vessel equipped with a stirrer, reflux condenser and an inert gas atmosphere. The reaction mixture was heated to 100 110 0C., over about 15 minutes and then 0 heated in the 100 110 C. temperature range for a further two hours. 16. 52g. of the ethanolamine were then added dropwise at 110 C. over a period of about 0.5 hour. The reaction mixture was heated to 120 C. over a period of about 0.5 hour and was then heated in the temperature range 120 to 1300C. for to hours.As in Example 1E, low boiling fractions were distilled out of the reaction mixture in such a way as to obtain a reaction temperature of 150 C. The reaction mixture was heated fro three hours at 1500C. There were no signs of any gelation occurring throughout these operations.Furthermore, frothing of the reaction mixture after the amine addition and during the subsequent heating was found to be less troublesome with this Example than for other example, such as Example 4, which lloyed methanol as the sierif ing alcohol and which were heated more rapidly to 150 C. The reaction mixture was cooled to 1000C. and 35g.of toluene were added. Toluene, together with the water and n butanol released by the imidation process, were distilled out of the reaction mixture under vacuum. The hydroxy functionalised polybutadiene obtained had a viscosity of 59 Pa.s. 250C . The hydroxy functionalised nature of the polymer prepared in this Example was demonstrated by mixing 25g. of the polymer with 1.41g.of toluene diisocyanate and 0.0141g. 1,4 diazabiczelo 2.2.2 octane. The mixture vas left at 500C. for four hours after which time it had cured to give a rubbery material free of surface tak and similar to that obtained by the toluene diisocyanate cure of the polymer prepared inExample 4. EXANSLE 6 350g. of maleinised polymer, prepared as described in Example 4, and 24g. of n butanol were charged to a reaction vessel equipped with a stirrer, reflux condenser and an inert gas atmosphere.

The reaction mixture was heated to 120 C. and was then heated in the temperature range 120 to 130 C. for a period of two hours. As in Example 1E, low boiling fractions were distilled out of the reaction mixture in such a way as to obtain a reaction temperature of 150 C. The reaction mixture was heated for three hours at 150 C. As in Example 5, problems associated with forthing of the reaction mixture were minimised. There were no signs of an gelation occurring throughout these operations. The reaction mixture was cooled to 1000C. and 35g. oi toluene were added. Toluene, together with the water and n butanol released by the imidation process were distilled out of the reaction mixture under vacuum. The hydroxy functionalised polybutadi ene obtained had a viscosity of 48 Pa.s. 25 C . The hydroxy functionalised nature of the polymer prepared in this Example was demonstrated by mixing 25g. of the polymer with 1.41g. of toluene diisocyanate and 0.0141g. of 1,4 diazabicyclo 2.2.2. octane. The mixture was left at 50 C. for four hours after which time it had cured to give a rubbery material free of surface tack and similar to the cured materials obtained from the polymers prepared in Examples 5 and 6. EXAMPLE 7 A liquid polybutadiene known as Lithene LX16 and having a number average molecular weight of about 8,000g. mole 1, a narrow molecular weight distribution, a viscosity of 10.4 Pa.s. 25 C and a microstructure of about 14 vinyl 1,2, 57 trans 1,4 and 27 cis 1,4 configuration was reacted with 10 wt maleic anhydride based on the total adduct weight in the manner described in Example 4, to give a maleinised polymer having a viscosity of 37 Pa.s. 250C .EXAMPLE 7A not according to the invention 200g. of the maleinised polymer were reacted with 6.53g. of methanol for 1 hour at 60 to 80 C. in a reaction vessel equipped with a stirrer, reflux condenser and an inert gas atmosphere. The reaction temperature was increased to 1000C. over about 15 minutes and 12.5g.of ethanolamine were added dropwise over 0 5 hour.
