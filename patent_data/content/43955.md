# Method of forming a glass ceramic structure.

## Abstract
Enhanced planarity and dimensional integrity of sintered glass ceramic structures containing multi level e.g. copper conductor patterns is obtained by a two stage firing of the structure, first between the anneal and softening points of the crystallizable glass particles in the structure, interrupting the firing, superimposing a lightweight platen on the struc ture, and heating through the coalescing temperature to the crystallization temperature of the glass.
