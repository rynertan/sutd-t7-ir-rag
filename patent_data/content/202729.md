## Description
Improvements in or relating to Conveyors BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION Wnis invention relates to conveyors and is concerned with conveyors employing endless round ii chains, the links tcing the form of elongated rings, each having two substantially 2rellel straight sides Intercornected by substantially semi circular end portions. Conveyors employing endless round link chains are often used to transport bread tins, baking sheets and trays hereinafter collectively referred to as tins , as well as products.However, contact between the heavy links of the chains and the tins or products can result in damage to the same. An object of the present invention is to at least reduce the possibility of damage to articles being transported.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION According to the invention, a conveyor coprises an endless round link chain disposed within a guide track flanking upper portions of alternate links of the chain, and article support members attached to said alternate links by means of jaw portions gripping structural parts thereof. Attachment of an zrticle support menber to a link may be direct, whereby jaw portions grip a structural part of the link, or indirect, whereby jaw portions grip a structural extension of the link. The sport member may have lower surface portions in slideable contact with the upwardly facing track surfaces. The article support members may be positively secured to the alternate links by use of a strong bonding material. The invention also conprises any novel subject matter or combination including novel subject matter herein disclosed. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Embodiments of the invention will now be described by way of example only, with reference to the accompanyinz drawings, wherein Figure 1 is an end view, in section, of a conveyor, Figure 2 is a view from above, in perspective, of the conveyor, Figure 3 is a view from the side and below, again in perspective, and to an enlarged scale, Figure 4 is 2 view similar to Figure 3, and illustrates another conveyor, Figure 5 is an end view, in section, of the conveyor of Figure 4, and Figures 6 to 12 are views in perspective of modifications. In the figures, like reference nunerals refer to like components. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT z With reference to Figure 1, 2 and 3, 2 conveyor 1 comprises an endless round link chain 2 disposed within E sox like guide track 3 having upwardly facing surfaces 4 flanking upper portions of alternate links 5a of the chain 2, and article support members 6 attached indirectly to the alternate links 5a by means of jaw portions 7 gripping elongate members in the form of rods B secured to the links. Thch support member 6 has lower surface portions 9 in slidable contact with the upwardlar facing track surfaces 4. The chain 2, which is of steel, comprises interengsing links 5a and 5b of identical forc. each link comprises an elongated ring, having two substantially straight sides interconnected by substantially semi circular end portions. The guide track 3 is of plastics material and is provided with an upper, lonr itudinally extending slot 15 alloz.ing free passage of the upper portions, i.e. the uppermost of each straight side , of alternate links 5a. rTne article support members 6 of this example are of DELRIN , Registered Trade Mark , a plastics material, comprising an acetal resin. The conveyor 1 of this example is used to transport bread tins, although other articles, including bread loaves, may be carried on it.The article support members 6, which are spaced from each other, serve as platforms in conveying the tins. The plastics material used to form the support members 6 end track 3, ensures that low frictional forces exist between these components and the surfaces 4 over which they slide. The material of the members 6 and track 3 is elso resilient, has a good resistance to wear, and is non toxic. The rods 8, which comprise structural extensions of the chain links 5a, extend laterally of these links and are welded thereto, substantially midway along the lengths of the rods. The link extension rods e are received by recesses comprising grooves 16 of part circular lateral cross section formed in the article support members 5. Entr of P rod 8 into a groove 16 is by way of a pair of jaw portions 7 which yield resiliently to allow passage of a rod 8 and thereafter return to their original positions and so hold the rod in place.The grooves 16 and jaw portions 7 thereof can be viewed as snap fasteners which secure member 6 to z rod 8 and thus to a chain link 5a. The article support members 6 are also formed with grooves 17 of substantially semi circular lateral cross section, which locate the upper portion of a chain link Sa and thus ensure that the member 6 is seated firmly on the link. With reference now to Figures 4 and 5, the conveyor 21 illustrated thereto makes use of article support members 25. The members 25 are attached directly to alternate links 5z by means of jaw portions 27 of part circular grooves 26, which grip the links in a resilient manner, forming snap fasteners. m2ck support member 25 has lower surface portions 29 in slideable contact with upwardly facing surfaces 24 of the track 23. The surfaces 24 may be dispensed with if the members 25 are positively secured to the links 5a by use of a stronS bonding material. The technique of bonding an article support member to a link is not linited to the conveyor of Figures 4 and 5 and may be employed with other support member chain link combinations of this disclosure. Figures 6 and 7 illustrate further forms of article support members, namely members 35 end 45 respectively. Grooves 36 and 46, jaw portions 37 and 47, and surfaces 39 and 49, correspond to grooves 26, jaw portions 27 and surfaces 29 of Figure 4. Member 35 has substantially flat upper surface. member 45 has a domed upper surface. Figure 8 illustrates a modification wherein opposite ends of a groove 16c of an article support member 6c are partially closed by end walls 50. The end walls 50 serve to limit axial movement of rod E within its locating groove 16c. The end walls 50, which are integral with the article support member 6c, have segment like cut away portions 51 which allow the member 6c to remain resilient. With reference to Figure 9, which is a modification of theFigure 3 conveyor, the rods 8 and grooves 16 of Figure 3 are, in effect, reorientated whereby rods 108 now extend longitudinally along the upper sides of links 105a, and grooves 17 Figure 3 are dispensed with. The odification of Figure 9 results in the article support members 106 being attached directly to the links 105a, by means of the jaw portions 107 zipping the rods 105 secured to the upper sides of the links. Figures 10, 11 and 12 illustrate modifications of the conveyor of Figure 4. with reference to Figure 10, a spigot 260 extends upwardly from each chain link 205a. The spigot 260 is located by a socket 261 formed in the article support member. 205. Figure 11 illustrates a similar modification, wherein a rib 365 extends longitudinally along the upper sides of each link 305a. Each rib 365 is located by a cooperating groove 366 formed in the associated article support member 305. The modifications of Figures 9, 10 and 11 comprise arrangements wherein extension members 108, 260, 365 are secured to links 105a etc. and the associated article support members are formed with cooperating recesses 116, 261, 366 for receiving the extension members. Figure 12 illustrates an arrangement which, in effect, is a reversal of that shown by Figure 10. In Figure 12, each articlesupport member 405 carries a downwawdly extending spigot 370 which is located by a socket 371 formed in the upper side of each associated link 405a. EEnere possible, one or more features of one conveyor disclosed herein may be substituted for one or more features of another conveyor of the disclosure. A pair of endless cheins, each carryin a plurality of articlesupport members, may be employed. However, a single chain can be used if wider support members are provided. The conveyor chain s are driven by conventional means, not shown , for example, by wheels, which in turn are driven by sprocket chain drives rotated by electric motors. The invention allows chains to change direction and negotiate corners without undue difficulty.
