# Ammonia synthesis catalysts and catalyst precursors and process for their preparation.

## Abstract
High surface area, e.g. precipitated, ammonia catalyst precursors are promoted with an alkaly metal salt of a transition metal acid, e.g. potassium ferrate, ferrite, permanganate, ruthe nate, chromate, or ferrocyanide. The use of such promoters in place of potassium carbonate enables the catalyst to be activated at lower temperatures thus reducing the risk of sintering of the active metal.
