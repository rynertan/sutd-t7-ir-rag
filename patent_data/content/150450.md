## Description
PROCESS FOR PREPARING AN IMPACT RESISTANT ETHYLENE PROPYLENE BLOCK COPOLYMER The invention relates to a process for preparing an impactresistant ethylene propylene block copolymer, charaterized in that in a first polymerization step a propylene prepolymer is produced consisting for at least 98 wt of propylene groups and having a melt index measured according to ASTM D 1238 at 503K and 21.6 N of 0.1 100 dg min, preferably 0.5 50 dg min, in that in the presence of the propylene prepolymer produced in the first polymerization step ethylene and propylene are polymerized in a second polymerization step in such a manner that a starting ethylene propylene block copolymer is formed at least consisting of an at least almost completely homopolymeric propylene part and a copolymeric ethylene propylene part, the weight ratio between the at least almost completely homopolymeric propylene part and the copolymeric ethylene propylene part being between 3 2 and 9 1, containing a total amount of 10 25 wt ethylene groups and having a melt index measured according to ASTM D 1238 at 503K and 21.6 N which is 1 100 to , preferably 1 50 to 34 part of the melt index measured according to ASTM D 1238 at 503K and 21.6N of the propylene prepolymer, and in that this starting ethylene propylene block copolymer is subsequently subjected to a kneading treatment consisting of one or more kneading operations, which kneading takes place in the presence of free radicals as a temperature of at least 450 K, preferably at 470 570 K. The ethylene content is measured by means of IR analysis of the polymer in melted condition. The Izod value is measured on an injectionmoulded test sheet and the E modulus on a compressionmoulded test sheet with a thickness of 1.6 mm. The kneading treatment can be effected in various ways. It implies the exertion of mechanical forces on the starting ethylenepropylene block copolymer e.g. by means of a kneading and or transport screw of e.g. extruding or injectionmoulding equipment or by means of a rolling devide. Preference is given to single screw or multi screw kneading, which kneading operation can be repeated more than once, and in which one or more of the kneading operations can be followed by extrusion. The duration of the kneading treatment is at least 1 4 minute, particularly at least 1 minute. If the kneading treatment consists of more than one kneading operation, there may be a longer period of time between two kneading operations. Thus in a first kneading operation a pre product for instance a granulate can be prepared, subsequently be transported to another place and finally be processed in a second kneading operation according to the invention to form an end product according to the invention. The presence of free radicals in the process according to the invention can be realized in any suitable manner. A suitable manner consists in the addition, before and or during the said kneading treatment of a total amount of 10 20000 parts by weight of one or more peroxides per 106 parts by weight starting ethylene propylene block copolymer to the substance or substances subjected or to be subjected to the kneading treatment. Preference is given to using peroxides having at the average temperature of a kneading operation, a half time value less than 1 5 of the duration of the relative kneading treatment.Suitable peroxides are di t butylperoxyisopropyl benzene, 1, 1 di t butylperoxy 3 ,3 , 5 trimethylcyclohexane, 1, 1 di t butylperoxycyclohexane, t butylperoxyisopropylcarbonate, t butylperoxybenzoate, di cumylperoxide, di t butylperoxide, 2,2 di t butylperoxybutane, di benzoylperoxide, 2,5 direthylhexane 2,5 di t butylperoxide and 2,5 di methylhexyn 2,5 di t butylperoxide. Another suitable manner for realizing the presence of free radicals is the high energy irradiation, for instance electron radiation or gamma radiation, of the starting ethylene propylene block copolymer subjected or to be subjected to the kneading treatment, preferably in the almost complete absence of stabilizers, at a dose of 0.1 4 Mrad. All kinds of combinations of the use of peroxides and of the said irradiation are suitable as well. The kneading treatment according to the invention is preferably effected in whole or in part in the presence of at least 50 parts by weight of one or more zinc and or cadmium compounds, calculated as zinc and or cadmium atoms, per 106 parts by weight starting ethylene propylene block copolymer. Other additives, too, may be present or be added during this kneading treatment, for instance heat stabilizers, W stabilizers and nucleation agents. Very suitable fillers for ethylene propylene block copolymers produced by a process according to the invention are chalk, with by preference an average particle size of below 2 m, and talcum, with by preference an average particle size of below 5 ecum. Suitable are quantities of filler of below 25 wt . A higher weight percentage of filler quickly leads to very bad mechanical properties of the copolymer filler mixture compared with the pure copolymer. The impact resistant ethylene propylene block copolymers produced by a process according to the invention are very suitable for use in car bumpers, front ends, spoilers, liners, motor car underside coats and wheel archlining for motor cars.
