# Read write scanning equipment.

## Abstract
Scanning equipment is disclosed having N scanning heads positioned at predetermined matrix points of a matrix array so as to scan along interlaced substantially parallel scan lines on a medium during relative scanning movements between the medium and the head array in a scan pass direction parallel to the scan lines, such interlaced scanning movement being produced by repeated relative movement between the medium and the head array in a medium advance direction and in an array indexing direction transverse thereto. The specification describes methods of determining the positions to be occupied by the scanning heads. One method is illustrated in Figure 2. The heads are notionally arranged in a line N1 to N11 and are then notionally re arranged in sub groups S1, S2, S3. The heads in sub groups S1, S2, S3 are spaced apart a distance greater than the minimum spacing physically required between two adjacent heads. The sub groups are then formed into a linear array by displacing S2 and S3 a distance P and 2P where P is equal to N
