# Coating process by electrodeposition and coating compositions useful in the process.

## Abstract
A conductive substrate as cathode is coated by elec trodeposition using a coating material which comprises a sterically stabilised dispersion of film forming polymer parti cles in an aqueous medium, the polymer comprising or being associated with a stabilising polymeric non ionic hydrophilic moiety which is solvated by the aqueous medium and being free from stabilising ionic charges. The dispersion of film forming polymer particles has a critical coalescence value which is more negative than 0.3 units.
