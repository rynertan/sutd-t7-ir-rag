# Water blocked optical fiber cable.

## Abstract
A water tight optical fiber cable constructed without the need of a viscous water blocking compound. At least one water absorbing fibrous braid 2 is placed adjacent each optical fiber 1 to absorb any water which may be present in or enter the cable. Additionally, one or more water absorbing fibrous braids 2 may be disposed between a tape layer 4 and the surrounding protective sheath 5 of the cable.
