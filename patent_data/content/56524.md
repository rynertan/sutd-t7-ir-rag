# Method for curtailing phosphorous impurity in the production of AlF3.

## Abstract
In the production of hydrogen fluoride gas for the production of AlFâ‚ƒ by the reaction of fluorspar with concen trated sulphuric acid a small amount of aluminium sulphate is introduced into the reactive mix to assist in the retention of phosphorous compounds in the solid residues of the reac tion and thus reduce the phosphorous content of the gaseous HF. Aluminium sulphate may be added as alum or may be generated in situ in the sulphuric acid by addition of an alumina hydrate, preferably before the acid is brought into contact with fluorspar. The addition of a small amount of calcium carbonate to the fluorspar also improves retention of phosphorous compounds in the solid residues in some instances.
