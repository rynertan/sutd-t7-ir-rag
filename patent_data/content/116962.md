# FRAME SYNCHRONIZING SYSTEM

## Abstract
The frame synchronizing system for a muliplex trans mission system comprises a center unit 1 and a plurality of terminal units 3,4,5 . They are interconnected through up and down dual bus transmission lines R,T . Communica tions between the center unit 1 and each terminal unit 3,4,5 or between the terminal units 3,4,5 are performed on the time division basis. The frame synchronising system comprises a bus terminator 2 , too. It is provided across terminal ends of the bus transmission lines R,T . The bus terminator 2 returns a frame synchronizing bit having a plurality of bits on the down transmission line R to the up transmission line T . Each terminal unit 3,4,5 performs frame synchronization in accordance with the returned frame bit to send a signal to the up transmission line T at a phase subject to the phase synchronization. With this system, bit overlap between channels of respective terminal units can be eliminated to ensure accurate transmission.
