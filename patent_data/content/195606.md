# Optical head in an optical memory device.

## Abstract
In an optical head of an optical memory device which records, reproduces or erases information onto or from a recording medium by applying a laser beam to the recording medium, a beam splitter is disposed in an optical path to conduct a portion of the laser beam emitted from a laser device to a light detector. In accordance with a detected value from this light detector, the influence of a stray beam generated in an optical system is removed from a servo error signal.
