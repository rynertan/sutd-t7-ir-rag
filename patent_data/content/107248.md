# Switching amplifier.

## Abstract
A switching amplifier is described which is intended in particular for sample and hold circuits. The switching amplifier has an output stage T₁, T₂ of the npn npn type comprising two output transistors T₁, T₂ in series. The output 4 is con nected to the emitter of a first one T₁ of the two output tran sistors T₁, T₂ and to the collector of the second output tran sistor T₂ , a diode T₃ being arranged between the output 4 and this collector. The output 4 can be switched off by switching the voltage on the base of the first transistor T₁ and the voltage on the point between the diode T₃ and the the col lector of the second transistor T₂ relative to the output volt age, a third transistor T₄ ensuring that in this situation the col lector current of the second transistor T₂ can be drained when said diode T₃ is turned off, so that initially said second transistor T₂ can remain conductive.
