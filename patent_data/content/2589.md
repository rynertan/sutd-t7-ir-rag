# A 40104 antibiotics, their preparation, and formulations containing them.

## Abstract
The novel A 40104 antibiotic complex, comprising active factors A, B, C, and D, is produced by the novel submerged aerobic fermentation of the new strain of Clitopilus pseudopinsitus NRRL 11179. Individual factors A, B, and C have been isolated. A 40104 factor C is the known antibiotic pleuromutilin. A 40104 factors A and B are novel antibiotics related to pleuromutilin, A 40104 factor A, the major new factor, is the D xylose acetal derivative of pleuromutilin. A 40104 factors A and B, their 19, 20 dihydro derivatives and the per C₂ C₆ alkanoyl derivatives of factors A and B and of their 19, 20 dihydro derivatives are active against gram positive and gram negative bacteria, anaerobic bacteria, and Mycoplasma.
