# Shield type tunneling machine.

## Abstract
A shield type tunneling machine comprises a shield body 12 having a front portion converging gradually rearward, a crankshaft 24 journalled rotatably by a dia phragm 20 provided in the shield body, a drive mechanism 30 connected to an end of the crankshaft and a conical or frustconical rotary head 16 supported rotatably by the other end and disposed in the front portion of the shield body to be turned eccentrically, a gear mechanism 40,42 for forcibly rotate the rotary head and means 34,36 for discharging debris from a front area of the diaphragm to a rear area. The tunneling machine, when thrusted in the ground by a jack, receives earth and sand into the front portion of the shield body and compresses them between the rotary head and the shield body to send them to the rear. The machine can be used for a pipe jacking as well as the tunneling in the soft ground.
