# Continuous form for printer.

## Abstract
A continuous form for printer is preprinted at regular intervals with headings 8,9 and provided at regular intervals with reference marks 4, 5, 11, 6, 7, 12 . Such reference marks allow to obtain, through longitudinal cut of the form in positions correlated to such marks, both sheets of a first type 1, 3 provided with preprinted heading and sheets of a second type 2 , the several types of sheets having the same sizes. The cutting operation may be automatically performed by printers provided with cutter and with detecting means for recognition of the reference marks.
