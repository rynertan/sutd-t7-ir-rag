# Leather like articles made from cellulosic filler loaded ethylene interpolymers.

## Abstract
Articles having leather like appearance are obtained from compositions comprising 15 55 by weight of an ethylene in terpolymer, such as ethylene vinyl ester, ethylene unsaturated mono or dicarboxylic acids or esters of said unsaturated ac ids, ethylene Î± olefin copolymers, etc. 1 15 by weight of at least one plasticizer selected from the group consisting of pro cessing oils, epoxidized oils, polyesters, polyethers and poly etheresters 20 70 by weight of cellulosic filler or mixture of cellulosic filler and mineral filler 0 10 by weight of at least one additive, such as organic acid, organic acid derivative and surface active agent and 0 27.5 by weignt of elastomeric po lymer.
