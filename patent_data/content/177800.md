# BIREFRINGENT OPTICAL WAVELENGTH MULTIPLEXER DEMULTIPLEXER

## Abstract
An optical multiplexer demultiplexer 11 provides for arbitrarily closely spaced wavelength channels 18, 19, 21, 22 , the spacing and locations thereof being determined by the thickness of birefringent crystals such as, for example, quartz. Such a device can also be used for duplexing bi directional signals. Methods for mechanically tuning the devices to given laser wavelengths are described, as well as simplified constructions which can be used with po larized light sources such as lasers.
