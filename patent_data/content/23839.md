# Screen assembly.

## Abstract
A pressurized screen assembly 10 , particularly for screening paper making pulp, includes a cylindrical screen plate 20 mounted within a cylindrical casing 12 and defining with it an annular chamber 24 which receives unscreened pulp from which rejects are removed as the good pulp passes through the screen plate. The axes of the screen plate and cas ing are offset with respect to each other, forming an enlarge ment of the chamber 24 which extends approximately from a pulp inlet 28 into the chamber to a rejects outlet 30 diamet rically opposite the inlet. A partition 40 in the chamber ex tends from a position opposite the inlet to a position above the rejects outlet. The partition is spaced from the screen and cas ing and a baffle 50 is provided which extends co extensively with the partition and slopes helically downwardly about the screen plate from the inlet to the rejects outlet so as to form a passage of decreasing cross sectional area. Inlets 62, 64 are also provided for adding dilution liquid to the passage up stream of the rejects outlet and a purging liquid just upstream of the rejects outlet.
