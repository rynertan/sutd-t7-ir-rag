# Alternating current motor having current filter.

## Abstract
An alternating current motor drive in which the motor is furnished with electrical excitation from an alternating current source through a conrollable power converter also includes first and second capacitor circuits connected to the common point between the converter and the motor. The first capacitor circuit is connected to the common point through an isolating inductor circuit. The second capacitor circuit is connected to the common point via the parallel combination of an inductor circuit and a resistor circuit. A further embodiment includes a variable VAR generator connected to the junction of the second capacitor circuit and the parallel combination of the inductor and resistor circuits.
