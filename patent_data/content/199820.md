# DISC DEVICE.

## Abstract
In the disc device, the information signals are recorded on a disc or the information signals recorded on the disc are reproduced, with the rotation of the disc controlled suitably. A clock signal which modulates the intensity of the reflected light and an information signal which turns the planes of polarization of the reflected light in two different directions and does not modulate the intensity of the reflected light are recorded on the disc. The modulation of the intensity of the reflected light is detected to reproduce the clock signal, and the reflected light having planes of polarization which face in two different directions is differentially detected. The infor mation signal is thus reproduced without being influenced by the intensity modulation. This enables the clock signal and information signal to be reproduced separately even when they are recorded in a superposed state.

## Description
SPECIFICATION DISC DEVICETechnical Field The present invention relates to a disc device for recording information signals in or reproducing them from a disc while disc rotation is controlled.Background Art A magneto optical disc device is a typical example of the disc device described above. Pregrooves consisting of address pits and DC grooves are preformed on the magneto optical disc. Tracking and address readout are performed using the pregrooves. If such a magneto optical disc is rotated at a constant angular velocity, proper recording or reproducing can be performed using these pregrooves. Clock information, however, cannot be obtained from the pregrooves at small intervals. If the magneto optical disc is rotated at a constant linear velocity to increase the recording information quantity, the disc device must have a linear encoder and a CPU. The CPU calculates a predetermined rotational speed from an addresses and sends a control signal to a rotation servo system. However, if the disc device has the linear encoder and the CPU, a compact device becomes expensive. If clock information can be obtained from the pregroove formed on the disc, disc rotation can be controlled by a simple mechanism and circuit. However, when a clock signal is recorded in pregrooves in the same manner as addressing, i.e., by forming pits, the clock and information signals are superposed. As a result, the information signals cannot be properly reproduced.Disclosure of Invention A disc device according to the present invention comprises a disc recorded with a clock signal for modulating an intensity of reflected light and an information signal for turning the plane of polarization of the reflected light in a first or second direction, and an optical system for detecting the reflected light whose intensity is modulated and for differentially detecting the reflected light having the plane of polarization in the first direction and the reflected light having the plane of polarization in the second direction, wherein rotation of the disc is controlled in response to the clock signal reproduced on the basis of the differential detection and information signal recording or reproducing according to the differential detection is performed. In the disc device according to the present invention, the modulation of the intensity of the reflected light is detected to reproduce the clock signal, and the reflected light having planes of polarization which face in two different directions is differentially detected. This enables the clock signal and the information signal to be reproduced separately, even when they are recorded in a superposed state.Brief Description of Drawings Fig. 1 is a sectional view showing pregrooves of a disc according to an embodiment of the present invention Fig. 2 is a graph showing the intensity of the reflected light modulated by the pregrooves inFig. 1 and Fig. 3 is a graph showing a differentially detected information signal.Best Mode of Carrying Out the Invention An embodiment of the present invention, applied to an magneto optical disc device, will be described with reference to Figs. 1 to 3. In a magneto optical disc device, the direction of magnetization of a perpendicular magnetized film is inverted to record a signal. The signal is reproduced by detecting a component polarized by a polar Kerr effect among magneto optical Kerr effects. In the magneto optical disc device of this embodiment, light reflected by the magnetized film is split into two beams by a half mirror. The two reflected beams pass through separate analysers for upward and downward magnetization respectively, and then are detected by separate photodetectors. The outputs from the photodetectors are differentially detected to reproduce the signal. According to the differential detection method, as a common mode signal such as noise can be rejected, signal reproducing with a high C N can be achieved. A common mode rejection ratio by the differential detection method varies according to spatial frequencies. The ratio is given by a value varying from about 20 dB in a relatively low frequency band to about 10 dB in a relatively high frequency band. Pregrooves 1 in the magneto optical disc in this embodiment consist of address pits 2 having a depth of V4 where X is the wavelength of the read light and grooves 3, as shown in Fig. 1. The grooves 3 are formed in the form of a sinusoidal wave. The sinusoidal wave has an amplitude of 2Ex sufficiently smaller than B 8 with respect to the A 8 depth as the center of the wave level and a frequency of about 10 kHz. The information signals are recorded in the grooves 3 at a frequency of several MHz. The modulation of the intensity of light reflected by the magneto optical disc becomes maximum at the A 4 depth as in the address pit 2, and minimum at the zero depth. The modulation values of the intensity of the reflected light are extremal values on the surface of the magneto optical disc and at the A 4 depth. The modulation value changes about linearly near the A 8 depth as in the grooves 3. For this reason, even if the sinusoidal wave such as the grooves 3 is formed on the surface of the magneto optical disc or at the h 4 depth, the intensity of the reflected light cannot be substantially modulated thereby. However, if the sinusoidal wave is formed at the A 8 depth such as the grooves 3, the intensity of the reflected light can be modulated thereby. As a result, when the light reflected by the pregrooves 1 is measured, the intensity profile is substantially the same as the sectional shape of the pregrooves 1, as shown in Fig. 2. In this case, if the intensity of the light reflected by the mirror surface portion of the magneto optical disc is compared with the intensity shown in Fig. 2, the intensity level of the surface of the address pit 2 is about 0.8 and the level of the groove 3 is about 0.55 0.05 if the level of the mirror surface portion is defined as 1. Even if the information signals are recorded in the grooves 3, the reflectance of the magneto optical disc does not change so that the intensity profile in Fig. 2 also does not change. In addition, the information signals recorded in the grooves 3 have higher frequencies than those of the sinusoidal wave formed in the grooves 3. The intensities of the individual reproduced information signals, therefore, have as DC components the modulated portions a maximum level of which corresponds to Ax. When the information signal is reproduced by the differential detection method as described above, the DC component can be eliminated by the common mode signal rejection effect. Therefore, the information signal can be reproduced without being influenced by the sinusoidal wave formed in the grooves 3. In practice, however, a slight influence acts on the reproduced information signal. As shown in Fig. 3, the signal is slightly AM modulated. By comparing the frequency of the sinusoidal wave portion of the signal in Fig. 2 with the frequency of a reference signal, a magneto optical disc linear velocity deviation from a predetermined velocity can be detected. The sinusoidal wave formed in the grooves 3 serves as a clock signal. The linear velocity corresponding to the rotation of the magneto optical disc can be controlled to be constant, and the information signals can be reproduced according to the differential detection method. A signal for modulating the grooves 3 is preferably a sinusoidal wave having a frequency for gaining a large common mode rejection ratio. If the intensity of the reflected light is modulated with a rectangular wave, a high frequency spectrum is formed.In such a high frequency range, the common mode rejection ratio is decreased, as previously mentioned.As a result, the differential output is subjected to spike like modulation. The amplitude of the sinusoidal wave must fall within the range which does not influence reproduction of the information signal in the resultant common mode rejection ratio, and which stably reproduces the clock signal. Alternatively, the width of the groove 3 can be changed, in place of the depth of the groove 3, in the form of a sinusoidal wave.Industrial Applicability As described above, even if the clock and information signals are recorded in a superposed state in the disc device according to the present invention, these signals can be separately reproduced. The disc rotation can be controlled by a simple mechanism and circuit by using the clock signal prerecorded in the disc. In addition, even if the clock and information signals are recorded in a superposed state, these signals can be separately reproduced. If the clock signal is recorded on substantially the entire area of the disc, the clock signal can be reproduced at any location on the disc. Therefore, quick disc rotation control, i.e., high speed access can be performed.
