# Process and apparatus for joining protective plastic films to an extruded plastic sheeet, with the aid of an auxilairy plastic film.

## Abstract
A process and apparatus are described wherein a ho neycombed sheet of plastic 13 is extruded from an extrud ing means 10 and at least one protective film of plastic is joined onto at least one of its surface layers, said protective film having a softening temperature lower than that for ex truding the sheet. According to the invention the protective film 14 , com bined with the auxilliary film or support film 15 , is layed onto the surface of the sheet 13 leaving the extruding means then said sheet 13 , protective film 14 and support film 15 are subjected to the calibrating and cooling stage and lastly said support film 15 is separated from the sheet. The protective film has now been made an integral part of the sheet, protected honeycombed sheet .
