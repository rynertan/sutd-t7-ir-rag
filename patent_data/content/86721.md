# Apparatus for applying surgical clips.

## Abstract
Apparatus for applying surgical clips to tissue includes a self contained supply of clips and is constructed to apply those clips, one at a time, through movement of the thumb and fin gers of one hand. The clips are stored inside a sleeve along the length of the instrument, are fed into jaws at the distal end of the instrument, and are closed about tissue by a camming action produced by moving the jaws relative to the sleeve and camming them shut. An actuating and sequencing section con trols feeding and clip deformation, and guarantees that the instrument is operated only in the proper sequence so as to avoid jamming.
