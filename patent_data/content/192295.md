# Structural beam and panel systems and methods for making the same.

## Abstract
An elongated sheet metal panel 96 comprising a first portion including a major central portion 96A having transverse corrugations formed therein to a depth of at least about 0.100 inch, a transition portion 96B adjacent said first portion, and at least one marginal edge portion 96C which has a configuration which is either uncorrugated or has longitudinal corrugations or relatively light transverse corrugations therein. A method for forming the above described elongated sheet metal panel comprises passing the panel through a corrugation roll assembly 40 , a tension roll assembly 50 downstream of the corrugation roll assembly. A power transmitting arrangement 90 simultaneously drives the corrugation roll assembly and the tension roll assembly at different rotational velocities to provide a pulling force on said sheet metal panel. An edge roll subassembly 45A, 46A including a resilient mounting arrangement 103, 104, 105 which urges the edge rolls resiliently toward each other to hold portions of the edge panel section therebetween, thereby causing an inward drawing of metal from the edge panel section into the corrugated panel section for equalizing the overall lengths of the two sections. Structural joints between such panels and methods of forming such joints are also disclosed.
