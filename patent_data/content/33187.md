# Internally tensioned structural member.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a fiber composite structural member having end caps which provide for attachment to other members and internal tensioning means for securing the end caps to the member. The internal tensioning means also provide for stiffening of the member. The prior art has not provided satisfactory means for assembling fiberglass structural members to other parts of the structure, so that the desirable properties of fiberglass materials are not being fully exploited in construction. The present invention permits the use of any desired type of end attachment with the fiberglass member. Specific tensioning means are disclosed which provide for rapid assembly at the building site, for permanent security in the tensioning, and prevention of excess tensioning. The method of assembly of the member is disclosed and claimed.
