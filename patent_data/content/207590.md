Compounds of general formula XVa and XVb may be prepared by reacting a compound of general formula IIa or IIb with dimethylsulphonium methylide JACS 1962, The compounds, and their derivatives as defined above, also have plant growth regulating activities. The plant growth regulating effects of the compounds are manifested as, for example, by a stunting or dwarfing effect on the vegetative growth of woody and herbaceous mono and di cotyledonous plants. Such stunting or dwarfing may be useful, for example, in peanuts, cereals such as wheat and barley, oil seed rape, field beans, sunflowers, potatoes and soya bean where reduction in stem height, with or without further advantageous effects such as stem strengthening, thickening and shortening, internode shortening, increased buttress root formation and more erect stem and leaf orientation, may reduce the risk of lodging and may also permit increased amounts of fertiliser to be applied. The stunting of woody species is useful in controlling the growth of undergrowth under power lines etc. Compounds which induce stunting or dwarfing may also be useful in modifying the stem growth of sugar cane thereby increasing the concentration of sugar in the cane at harvest in sugar cane, the flowering and ripening may be controllable by applying the compounds. Stunting of peanuts can assist in harvesting. Growth retardation of grasses can help maintenance of grass swards. Examples of suitable grasses are The dwarfing may also be useful in miniaturising ornamental, household, garden and nursery plants eg. poinsettias, chrysanthemums, carnations, tulips and daffodils . As indicated above, the compounds can also be used to stunt woody species. This property can be used to control hedgerows or to shape or reduce the need for pruning, of fruit trees eg. apples, pears, cherries, peaches, vines etc . Some coniferous trees are not significantly stunted by the compounds so the compounds could be useful in controlling undesirable vegetation in conifer nurseries. The plant growth regulating effect may as implied above manifest itself in an increase in crop yield or in an ability in orchards and other crops to increase fruit set, pod set and grain set. In the potato, vine control in the field and inhibition of sprouting in the store may be possible. Other plant growth regulating effects caused by the compounds include alteration of leaf angle and changes in leaf morphology both of which may permit increased light interception and utilization and promotion of tillering in monocotyledonous plants. Improved light interception is of value in all major world crops, eg. wheat, barley, rice, maize, soya, sugarbeet, potatoes, plantation crops and orchard crops. The leaf angle effect may be useful for example in altering the leaf orientation of, for example, potato crops thereby letting more light into the crops and inducing an increase in photosynthesis and tuber weight. By increasing tillering in monocotyledonous crops eg. rice , the number of flowering shoots per unit area may be increased thereby increasing the overall grain yield of such crops. In addition better control and modification of hierarchical relationships is possible both in vegetative and reproductive stages of monocotyledonous and dicotyledenous plant growth, especially in cereals such as wheat, barley, rice and maize, whereby the number of flowering shoots per unit area may be increased and the size distribution of grains within the ear may be modified in such a way as to increase yield. In the treatment of rice plants, or rice crops the invention compounds can be applied, eg. as granules or a granular formulation, for example as slow release granules, to nursery boxes, paddy water and other like cultivation loci and media. In grass swards, especially amenity grass, an increase in tillering could lead to a denser sward which may result in increased resilience in wear and to increased yields and better quality of forage grass, eg. improved digestability and palatability. The treatment of plants with the compounds can lead to the leaves developing a darker green colour. In dicotyledonous plants such as soyabean and cotton, there may be promotion of sideshooting. The compounds may inhibit, or at least delay, the flowering of sugar beet and thereby may increase sugar yield or otherwise modify the flowering patterns in many other crops. They may also reduce the size of sugar beet without reducing significantly the sugar yield thereby enabling an increase in planting density to be made. Similarly in other root crops eg. turnip, swede, mangold, parsnip, beetroot, yam and cassava it may be possible to increase the planting density. The compounds could be useful in restricting the vegetative growth of cotton thereby leading to an increase in cotton yield. Crop yields may also be increased by improvement of the harvest index ie. the harvested yield as a proportion of the total dry matter produced by altering dry matter partitioning. This applies to all the aforementioned root, pod, cereal, tree, plantation and orchard crops. The compounds may be useful in rendering plants resistant to stress since the compounds can delay the emergence of plants grown from seed, shorten stem height and delay flowering these properties could be useful in preventing frost damage in countries where there is significant snow cover in the winter since then the treated plants would remain below snow cover during the cold weather. Further the compounds may cause drought or cold resistance in certain plants. When applied as seed treatments at low rates the compounds can have a growth stimulating effect on plants. In carrying out the plant growth regulating method of the invention, the amount of compound to be applied to regulate the growth of plants will depend upon a number of factors, for example the particular compound selected for use, and the identity of the plant species whose growth is to be regulated. However, in general an application rate of 0.1 to 15, preferably 0.1 to 5, kg per hectare is used. With the use of biodegradable polymeric slow release granules rates of 1 to 10g per hectare are feasible whilst electrodynamic spraying techniques may also deploy lower rates of application. However, on certain plants even application rates within these ranges may give undesired phytotoxic effects. Routine tests may be necessary to determine the best rate of application of a specific compound for any specific purpose for which it is suitable. The compounds may be used as such for fungicidal or plant growth regulating purposes but are more conveniently formulated into compositions for such usage. The invention thus provides a fungicidal or plant growth regulating composition comprising a compound of general formula I as hereinbefore defined, or a salt or metal complex thereof and, optionally, a carrier or diluent. The invention also provides a method of combating fungi, which comprises applying to a plant, to seed of a plant, or to the locus of the plant or seed, a compound, or salt or metal complex thereof as hereinbefore defined or a composition containing the same. The invention also provides a method of regulating plant growth, which comprises applying to the plant, to seed of a plant or to the locus of a plant or seed, a compound, or a salt or metal complex thereof, as hereinbefore defined, or a composition combining the same. In the foregoing process compound No 1 of Table I is especially useful. The compounds, salts, metal complexes, ethers and esters can be applied in a number of ways, for example they can be applied, formulated or unformulated, directly to the foliage of a plant, or they can be applied also to bushes and trees, to seeds or to other medium in which plants, bushes or trees are growing or are to be planted, or they can be sprayed on, dusted on or applied as a cream or paste formulation, or they can be applied as a vapour or as slow release granules. Application can be to any part of the plant, bush or tree, for example to the foliage, stems, branches or roots, or to soil surrounding the roots, or to the seed before it is planted or to the soil generally, to paddy water or to hydroponic culture systems. The invention compounds may also be injected into plants or trees and they may also be sprayed onto vegetation using electrodynamic spraying techniques. The term plant as used herein includes seedlings, bushes and trees. Furthermore, the fungicidal method of the invention includes preventative, protectant, prophylactic and eradicant treatment. The compounds are preferably used for agricultural and horticultural purposes in the form of a composition. The type of composition used in any instance will depend upon the particular purpose envisaged. The compositions may be in the form of dusting powders or granules comprising the active ingredient and a solid diluent or carrier, for example fillers such as kaolin, bentonite, kieselguhr, dolomite, calcium carbonate, talc, powdered magnesia, Fuller s earth, gypsum, Hewitt s earth, diatomaceous earth and China clay. Such granules can be preformed granules suitable for application to the soil without further treatement. These granules can be made either by impregnating pellets of filler with the active ingredient or by pelleting a mixture of the active ingredient and powdered filler. Compositions for dressing seed, for example, may comprise an agent for example a mineral oil for assisting the adhesion of the composition to the seed alternatively the active ingredient can be formulated for seed dressing purposes using an organic solvent for example N methylpyrrolidone or dimethylformamide . The compositions may also be in the form of dispersible powders, granules or grains comprising a wetting agent to facilitate the dispersion in liquids of the powder or grains which may contain also fillers and suspending agents. The aqueous dispersions or emulsions may be prepared by dissolving the active ingredient s in an organic solvent optionally containing wetting, dispersing or emulsifying agent s and then adding the mixture to water which may also contain wetting, dispersing or emulsifying agent s . Suitable organic solvents are ethylene dichloride, isopropyl alcohol, propylene glycol, diacetone alcohol, toluene, kerosene, methylnaphthalene, the xylenes, trichloroethylene, furfuryl alcohol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, and glycol ethers eg. 2 ethoxyethanol and 2 butoxyethanol . The compositions to be used as sprays may also be in the form of aerosols wherein the formulation is held in a container under pressure in the presence of a propellant, eg. fluorotrichloromethane or dichlorodifluoromethane. The compounds can be mixed in the dry state with a pyrotechnic mixture to form a composition suitable for generating in enclosed spaces a smoke containing the compounds. Alternatively, the compounds may be used in a micro encapsulated form. They may also be formulated in biodegradable polymeric formulations to obtain a slow, controlled release of the active substance. By including suitable additives, for example additives for improving the distribution, adhesive power and resistance to rain on treated surfaces, the different compositions can be better adapted for various utilities. The compounds can be used as mixtures with fertilisers eg. nitrogen , potassium or phosphorus containing fertilisers . Compositions comprising only granules of fertiliser incorporating, for example coated with, the compound are preferred. Such granules suitably contain up to 25 by weight of the compound. The invention therefore also provides a fertiliser composition comprising the compound of general formula I or a salt or metal complex thereof. The compositions may also be in the form of liquid preparations for use as dips or sprays which are generally aqueous dispersions or emulsions containing the active ingredient in the presence of one or more surfactants eg. wetting agent s , dispersing agent s , emulsifying agent s or suspending agent s or which are spray formulations of the kind suitable for use in electrodynamic spraying techniques. The foregoing agents can be cationic, anionic or non ionic agents. Suitable cationic agents are quaternary ammonium compounds, for example cetyltrimethylammonium bromide. Suitable anionic agents are soaps, salts of aliphatic monoesters of sulphuric acid for example sodium lauryl sulphate , and salts of sulphonated aromatic compounds for example sodium dodecylbenzenesulphonate, sodium, calcium or ammonium lignosulphonate, butylnaphthalene sulphonate, and a mixture of sodium diisopropyl and triisopropylnaphthalene sulphonates . Suitable non ionic agents are the condensation products of ethylene oxide with fatty alcohols such as oleyl or cetyl alcohol, or with alkyl phenols such as octyl or nonyl phenol and octylcresol. Other non ionic agents are the partial esters derived from long chain fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, the condensation products of the said partial esters with ethylene oxide, and the lecithins. Suitable suspending agents are hydrophilic colloids for example polyvinylpyrrolidone and sodium carboxymethylcellulose , and the vegetable gums for example gum acacia and gum tragacanth . The compositions for use as aqueous dispersions or emulsions are generally supplied in the form of a concentrate containing a high proportion of the active ingredient s , and the concentrate is to be diluted with water before use. These concentrates often should be able to withstand storage for prolonged periods and after such storage be capable of dilution with water in order to form aqueous preparations which remain homogeneous for a sufficient time to enable them to be applied by conventional and electrodynamic spray equipment. The concentrates may conveniently contain up to 95 , suitably 10 85 , for example 25 60 , by weight of the active ingredient s . These concentrates suitably contain organic acids eg. alkaryl or aryl sulphonic acids such as xylenesulphonic acid or dodecyl benzenesulphonic acid since the presence of such acids can increase the solubility of the active ingredient s in the polar solvents often used in the concentrates. The concentrates suitably contain also a high proportion of surfactants so that sufficiently stable emulsions in water can be obtained. After dilution to form aqueous preparations, such preparations may contain varying amounts of the active ingredient s depending upon the intended purpose, but an aqueous preparation containing 0.0005 to 10 , or 0.01 to 10 , by weight of active ingredient s may be used. The compositions of this invention can comprise also other compound s having biological activity, eg. compounds having similar or complementary fungicidal or plant growth activity or compounds having plant growth regulating, herbicidal or insecticidal activity. The other fungicidal compound can be, for example, one which is capable of combating ear diseases of cereals eg. wheat such as The compounds of general formula I can be mixed with soil, peat or other rooting media for the protection of plants against seed borne, soil borne or foliar fungal diseases. Suitable insecticides are Pirimor, Croneton, dimethoate, Metasystox and formothion. The other plant growth regulating compound can be one which controls weeds or seedhead formation, improves the level or longevity of the plant growth regulating activity of the compounds of general formula I , selectively controls the growth of the less desirable plants eg. grasses or causes the compound of general formula I to act faster or slower as a plant growth regulating agent. Some of these other agents will be herbicides. Examples of suitable plant growth regulating compounds, which can display synergy in admixture, or use, with the invention compounds are the gibberellins eg. GA₃, GA₄ or GA₇ , the auxins eg. indoleacetic acid, indolebutyric acid, naphthoxyacetic acid or naphthylacetic acid , the cytokinins eg. kinetin, diphenylurea, benzimidazole, benzyladenine or benzylaminopurine , phenoxyacetic acids eg. 2,4 D or MCPA , substituted benzoic acids eg. triiodobenzoic acid , morphactins eg. chlorfluorecol , maleic hydrazide, glyphosate, glyphosine, long chain fatty alcohols and acids, dikegulac, fluoridamid, mefluidide, substituted quaternary ammonium and phosphonium compounds eg. chlormequat chlorphonium or mepiquat chloride , ethephon, carbetamide, methyl 3,6 dichloroanisate, daminozide , asulam, abscisic acid, isopyrimol, 1 4 chlorophenyl 4,6 dimethyl 2 oxo 1,2 dihydropyridine 3 carboxylic acid, hydroxybenzonitriles eg. bromoxynil , difenzoquat , benzoylprop ethyl 3,6 dichloropicolinic acid, fenpentezol, triapenthanol, flurpirimidol, paclobutrazol, tetcyclacis and tecnazene. Synergy will be most likely to occur with those of the foregoing which are quaternary ammonium compounds and with those marked with an asterisk. The use of the compounds of general formula I in conjunction with gibberellins can be useful where it is desired to reduce the plant growth regulating effects of the compounds eg. where they are to be used as fungicides . Where the compounds are being applied to the soil surrounding the plants or to the roots of the plant, the plant growth regulating effects of the compounds may possibly be reduced by using also certain types of phenoxybenzoic acids and their derivatives.
