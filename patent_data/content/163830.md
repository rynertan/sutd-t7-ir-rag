# MULTI LAYER INTEGRATED CIRCUIT SUBSTRATES AND METHOD OF MANUFACTURE

## Abstract
A thin film composite structure consists of at least two layers M1, M2 of electrical wiring 11, 15 composed of a metal such as copper separated from each other for the most part by an intervening layer of an insulating material such as polyimide. A layer 12, 14 of a composite of an adhesion metal and a conductive metal Cr Cu blend is interposed between the copper wiring 11, 15 and the in sulating material 13 as well as between the copper wiring where they join in regions 16 where the dielectric has been opened to form vias and other electrical junction points between the layers. The preferred composition of the blend is in the range from 5 95 atomic percent Cr and 95 5 atomic percent Cu although other metals can be com bined with each. The purpose of the thin blend film is to enhance the adhesion of the layers while not increasing the resistance of the contacts between the upper and lower conducting layers, at the vias and other electrical junction points.
