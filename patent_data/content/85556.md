# A method of fractional collection of gastric acid secretion inhibiting components.

## Abstract
Gastric acid secretion inhibiting substance obtainable from mammalian urine by conventional method is fraction ated into the first and second components by gel filtration, adsorption and desorption on ion exchanger or elec trophoresis detecting each component by biological test methods. The activities of the two components differ from each other in the bilogical tests. The first component is a glucoprotein like substance of M.W. 100,000 and the second component is a peptide like substance of M.W. about 6,000.
