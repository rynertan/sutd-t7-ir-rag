# A housing seal.

## Abstract
An apparatus which seals a developer or cleaning housing of an electostatographic copying machine to pre vent the escape of toner particles therefrom. The toner particles 78 are captured by a layer 74 of a polymer containing a plasticizer and softened to become tacky. Additional toner particles stick to the tacky toner particles preventing their escape. Each successive layer of captured toner particles soften and become tacky capturing other toner particles thereto. An adhesive layer 76 may be provided on the polymer layer to enhance adhesion.
