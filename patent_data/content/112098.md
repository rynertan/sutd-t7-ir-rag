# Farrowing crates.

## Abstract
The crate 1 comprises two side members 2 , a front member in the form of a trough assembly 5 and a back member in the form of a rear gate 6 for confining a sow within the crate 1 in such a manner as to allow only limited movement of the sow. Each side member 2 consists of a fixed retainer frame 3 and a pivotable retainer frame 4 pivoted on an upper rail 9 of the frame 3 so that the bottom rail 16 of the frame 4 is movable outwardly to a limited extent when the sow applies her weight to it so as to enable the sow to lie down within the crate 1 whilst being supported by the bottom rail 16 . Pivotal movement of the two frames 4 is damped by a damper 22 so that the sow is lowered to the ground in a controlled manner, and the two frames are coupled together so that outward movement of one of the bottom rails 16 will cause corresponding outward movement of the other bottom rail 16 .
