# Fiber optic amplifier.

## Abstract
An optical fiber bidirectional amplifier includes a pair of small diameter optical fibers 12a, 12b , arranged in a side by side configuration, the first fiber 12a providing a pump ing source and the second fiber 12b doped with a material which will lase at the frequency of the signal to be amplified. The signal to be amplified propagates through the second fiber 12b to stimulate emission of coherent light from the lasing material, resulting in amplification of the signal. The refractive index of the first and second fibers 12a, 12b is substantially identical, but the coupling characteristic pro vided by the geometrical relationship between the pair of fi bers 12a, 12b yields a wavelength dependent coupling effi ciency. Specifically, the coupling efficiency at the wave lenght of the pumping source is relatively high, while the coupling efficiency at the wavelength of the signal to be am plified is relatively low. Thus, the pumping illumination is coupled from the first fiber 12a to the second fiber 12b to stimulate the doping material in the second fiber 12b , while the signal to be amplified remains relatively un coupled, and is amplified by the coherent light emitted by the lasing material.
