# Method of welding titanium alloy parts with an insert member consisting essentially of 0 to 3 by weight of aluminium and the balance of titanium.

## Abstract
A method of welding opposite end surfaces of two alphabeta type titanium alloy parts by a high energy density welding process comprising closely interposing an insert member between said end surfaces of the two titanium alloy parts, the material of said insert member consisting of 0 to 3 by weight of aluminium and incidental impurities, the balance being titanium. The obtained weld joints are subjected to a post welding heat treatment which is a combination of a solid solution heat treatment and a subsequent aging treatment.
