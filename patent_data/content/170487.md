# Hot melt gun.

## Abstract
A hot melt glue gun having a rod feeding mechanism 14 comprising trigger means 50 arranged to drive clamp ing means to grip a solid rod of thermoplastic material and to move the rod towards a melt chamber 17 of the gun. The clamping means includes a carriage 42 movable towards and away from the melt chamber and having a support portion 110 to accept a rod to be fed. The clamping means also includes, pivotally mounted on the carriage, a clamp member having a clamping arm portion 71 for gripping the rod against the support portion 110 , and a crank arm portion 70 . The crank arm portion has an operating portion 49 with a convex surface 64 arranged to co operate with pressure means 207 of pivotally mounted connecting means 52 . The connecting means is positioned to be operated by the trigger. By virtue of the disposition of the pivots and the clamping arm and of the shaping of the operating portion of the crank arm, an increased component of the feeding force is applied to the rod in a direction parallel to the axes of the melt chamber and of the rod thus improving the application of triggering effort in feeding the rod. The clamping arm portion is disposed and shaped to reduce distortion of the rod when gripping the rod.
