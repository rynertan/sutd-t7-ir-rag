# Video to digital converter and high speed video display system incorporating same.

## Abstract
A video to digital converter is disclosed for converting a frame of analog information received in raster fashion into digital data suitable for use in reproducing such a frame in a high speed video display system. An analog to digital converter is enabled to digitize all or only selected portions of the frame by means so as to produce data for reproducing an enlarged or magnified image of only a selected portion of the video frame or for reproducing substantially all the frame without enlargement. The digitized data is loaded into a display memory and is outputted via a display interface to a display board which may consist of variable intensity devices, such as, incandescent lamps. The system, although under computer control, does not include the computer in the data handling path thereby permitting increased data handling rates. The converter for the system includes circuits for changing the display format to produce zoom enlargements and wide screen displays suitable, for example, for racetrack applications.
