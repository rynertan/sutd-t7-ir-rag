## Description
This invention relates to cephalosporin derivatives which have antibacterial activity. Over the years a large amount of effort has been devoted in cephalosporin chemistry to variations at the 3 position. Among the myriad of chemical types that have been introduced at this position of the nucleus, one which was first reported more than 10 years ago is the pyridiniothiomethyl radical Nomura et at, The cephalosporin derivatives corresponding to those described above in which the sulphur is replaced by nitrogen are unknown. This may in part be due to the fact that the displacement reaction corresponding to that described above would be much more difficult to achieve because of the poor nucleophilicity of the analogous nitrogen reagent under the usual conditions. The nitrogen analogues are, however, readily prepared by the alternative reaction of a 3 aninomethylcephalosporin derivative with the appropriate chloropyridine. Indeed an analogous reaction process in cephalosporin chemistry for preparing 7 pyridinioamino cephalosporin derivatives is already known European Patent Publication 0018595 . However, despite the fact that the required starting material, the 3 aminomethylcephalosporin derivative, has been known since 1967 UK Patent 1,155,493 , the nitrogen analogues of the compounds described above have not heretofore been prepared. We have now discovered, and herein lies our invention, that cephalosporin derivatives carrying a standard 7 substituent and having at the 3 position a group CH₂ NH R in which R can be, for example, a quaternised pyridine radical, are wide spectrum antibacterial agents.

The following are 19 preferred features of the cephalosporin derivative of the invention. When any one of these features is taken, either singly or in combination, with the other general or particular features of the cephalosporin derivative of the invention listed above, there are obtained preferred sub groups of compounds. Particular compounds of the invention are described in the Examples. The following Table contains a group of preferred compounds. Of these the group consisting of the compounds of Examples 23, 25, 32, 36, 42, 59, 62, 63, 73 and 122 is particularly preferred. A suitable acid addition salt of the cephalosporin derivative of the invention is for example, a salt formed with hydrochloric, hydrobromic, phosphoric, sulphuric, citric or maleic acid. A suitable base addition salt of the cephalosporin derivative of the invention is, for example, an alkali metal salt e.g. a sodium or potassium salt , an alkaline earth metal salt e.g. a calcium or magnesium salt , or a salt with a primary, secondary or tertiary organic amine e.g. triethylamine, procaine, dibenzylamine and N,N¹ dibenzyl ethylenediamine, and other amines which have been used to form salts with cephalosporins . The cephalosporin derivative of the invention may be manufactured by methods known in themselves for the manufacture of chemically analogous compounds. The following processes, X,R1,R2,R3 and R4 having the meanings stated above, unless indicated otherwise, are therefore provided as further features of the invention. The process of the invention is characterised by When the compound of the formula I is obtained in the form of the free base or the zwitterion, and a salt is required, the compound of the formula I in the free base or zwitterionic form is reacted with an acid which affords a pharmaceutically acceptable anion, or when a compound of the formula I carries carboxy, with a base whichaffords a pharmaceutically acceptable cation. The compound of the formula XIX, and the acid addition salts thereof, is a valuable intermediate for preparing many of the compounds of the invention. This compound is therefore provided as a further feature of the invention. It may be prepared by reaction of a 3 aminomethyl 7 aminocephalosporin derivative in which the 7 amino group may optionally be protected in a process similar to that described in a above followed if necessary by removal of the protecting group . This process is illustrated in Examples 12, 13, 56 and the last two parts of Examples 68 80. The starting material of the formula XVIII for use in process a may be prepared by reaction of a 7 amino 3 azidomethylcephalosporin derivative in which when R3 is carboxy it is optionally protected with an acid or a protected or activated derivative thereof according to process e . The 3 azidomethyl group is then reduced to the 3 aminomethyl group, the optional protecting group or groups being removed either before or after this reduction step. This process is illustrated in Examples 1, 23 52, 66 67a, 81 82, 100 103 and 136. The starting material for use in process b may be prepared by carrying out process a or e using a suitably protected intermediate, to prepare the corresponding starting material. The use of process a is illustrated in Examples 17,19,22,36,45 and 131. The use of process e is illustrated in Examples 12,13,56, 68 80 and 91 99. As noted above the cephalosporin derivatives of the invention have antibacterial properties. Thus they are useful antibacterial agents, many of them having a broad spectrum of activity The antibacterial properties of the compounds of the invention may also be demonstrated in conventional mouse protection tests. Cephalosporin derivatives have generally been found to be relatively non toxic to warm blooded animals, and this generalisation holds true for the compounds of the present invention. A number of compounds were administered to mice at doses in excess of those required to afford protection against bacterial infections. Thus for example the compounds of Examples 23,70 and 74 were administered subcutaneously to mice in two single doses over one day, each dose being at least five times the minimum effective dose which protected 50 of the mice against infection with Salmonella dublin PD₅₀ . No overt toxic symptoms or side effects attributable to the administered compounds were noted. The results set out in the following Table are illustrative of the biological activity of the compounds of the present invention. The listed compounds all carry a 1 methyl 4 pyridinioaminomethyl radical at the 3 position of the cephalosporin nucleus and a variety of known substituents at the 7 position. The following results are those obtained on a standard According to a further feature of the invention there is provided a pharmaceutical composition which comprises a cephalosporin derivative of the invention in association with a non toxic pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier. The pharmaceutical composition of the invention may, for example be in a form suitable for oral, rectal or parenteral administration, for which purposes it may be formulated by means known to the art into the form of, for example, tablets, capsules, aqueous or oily solutions or suspensions, emulsions, dispersible powders, suppositories and sterile injectable aqueous or oily solutions or suspensions. In addition to the cephalosporin derivative of the formula I the pharmaceutical composition of the invention may also contain, or be co administered with, one or more known drugs selected from other clinically useful antibacterial agents for example other β lactams or aminoglycosides , inhibitors of β lactamase for example clavulanic acid , renal tubular blocking agents e.g. probenicid and inhibitors of metabolising enzymes for example inhibitors of peptidases, for example Z 2 acylamino 3 substituted propenoates . A preferred pharmaceutical composition of the invention is one suitable for intravenous, subcutaneous or intramuscular injection, for example a sterile injectable containing between 1 and 10 w w of the cephalosporin derivative, or one suitable for oral administration in unit dosage form, for example a tablet or capsule which contains between 100 mg. and 1 g. of the cephalosporin derivative. The pharmaceutical composition of the invention will normally be administered to man in order to combat infections caused by bacteria, in the same general manner as that employed for cephalothin, cefoxitin, cephradine and other known clinically used cephalosporin derivatives, due allowance being made in in terms of dose levels for the potency of the cephalosporin derivative of the present invention relative to the known clinically used cephalosporins. Thus each patient will receive a daily intravenous, subcutaneous or intramuscular dose of 0.5 to 50 g., and preferably 0.5 to 10 g., of the cephalosporin derivative, the composition being administered 1 to 4 times per day. The intravenous, subcutaneous and intramuscular dose will be given by means of a bolus injection. Alternatively the intravenous dose may be given by continuous infusion over a period of time. Alternatively each patient will receive a daily oral dose which is approximately equivalent to the daily parenteral dose. Thus a preferred daily oral dose is 0.5 to 10 g. of the cephalosporin derivative, the composition being administered 1 to 4 times per day.
