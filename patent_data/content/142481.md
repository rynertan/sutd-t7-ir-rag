# A METHOD FOR ANALYSIS OF A SAMPLE OF A SUBSTANCE BY MEANS OF PHOTOACOUSTIC OR OPTOTHERMAL SPECTROSCOPY AND A SAMPLE CARRIER FOR PERFORMING OF THE METHOD

## Abstract
A method for analysis by a sample of a substance by means of photoacoustic or optothermal spectroscopy. The sample of substance is applied on a sample carrier 13 , which is so dimensioned that 0,01 a.b 10 for the sample carrier with the sample at the intended wavelength and the modulation frequency, where a is the absorption coefficient of the sample and b is the thermal diffusion length for the sample at the intended modulation frequency. The sample carrier with sample is brought to close contact with the photoacoustic or optothermal detector 12 of the measure ment cell, where the measuring can be carried out. For a sample carrier with several layers, the layer facing the detector is demensioned with a thickness which is at least one diffusion length b for the intended sample and the modulation frequency. The invention also relates to sample carriers intended to be used for performing the method.
