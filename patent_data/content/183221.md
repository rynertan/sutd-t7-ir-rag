# IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO THE CONTROLLED GROWTH OF A CRYSTAL

## Abstract
A crystal growing furnace has lift and rotation control apparatus for both a growing crystal and a crucible contain ing a melt. A transducer and a servo motor are disposed above the furnace having respective shafts connected along a common horizontal axis on opposite sides of a longitudinal light tube wherein the light tube and transducer shaft can be axially positioned by the shaft of the servo motor. The light tube has a lens for focusing at times on a spot on a meniscus in the furnace and at times on the melt, a light sense detector is connected to the light tube for at times generating a servo motor control error signal to drive the servo motor incremen tally to an angular position corresponding to growth in the diameter of the meniscus by tracking a spot on the meniscus. The transducer generates an output signal indicative of incremental angular movement in response to growing the crystal for governing the lift and rotation control apparatus.
