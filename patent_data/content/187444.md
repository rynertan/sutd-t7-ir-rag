# High strength nickel base single crystal alloys.

## Abstract
Disclosed are novel nickel base single crystal alloy compositions consisting essentially of, by weight, about 8.0 14.0 chromium, 1.5 6.0 cobalt, 0.5 2.0 molybdenum, 3.0 10.0 tungsten, 2.5 7.0 titanium, 2.5 7.0 aluminum, 3.0 6.0 tantalum and the balance nickel. A combination of thermal treatment and coating of the novel alloys to enhance their mechanical properties is also disclosed.
