# A METHOD AND AN APPARATUS FOR IDENTIFYING A DETECTOR GIVING AN ALARM IN A LOOP CIRCUIT HAVING A PREDETERMINED NUMBER OF DETECTORS CONNECTED IN PARALLEL

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method and an apparatus for identifying a detector giving an alarm, said detector being one of a predetermined number of detectors 2 connected in parallel in a loop circuit connected to a line unit 1 . The line unit 1 supplies the loop circuit with a first signal and the detectors 2 in an alarm state are adapted to give a predetermined voltage drop across the loop circuit in response to the first signal. This voltage drop in turn gives rise to an alarm signal from the line unit 1 . In accordance with the invention, the line unit 1 is adapted to supply the loop circuit with a second signal in response to this voltage drop, and in response to this second signal the detector in an alarm state is adapted to emit a preprogrammed identifying signal to the line unit 1 for identifying said detector. The identifying signal can also include priority information.
