This invention further relates to a process for setting and conditioning hair, the improvement comprising applying to the hair the composition as defined above. The novelty of this invention lies with the stability of the aqueous siloxane metallic additive system. This stability allows the composition to be conveniently applied to hold a set in the hair, but when the hair is washed, the composition then acts as a conditioner. A stable aqueous siloxane metallic additive composition which could serve as a hair set and conditioner would be advantageous over existing systems.In hair care applications, the composition would b applied to wet or dry hair to serve as a conditioner and upon drying, a hair set. Updn washing, though, the composition would be reverted to polymer and act as a wet hair conditioner. An object of this invention is to provide a composition and process capable of performing the above.

The methods of preparation of the components of the present invention are well known to those skilled in the art and detailed elsewhere in the literature. Hence, no time or space need be devoted here to a repetition of such information. As far as is known at this time, the order or method of mixing the prepared components employed is not critical for the purpose of this invention. Suitable uses for this composition are in the field cf hair care and anywhere there is need for a reversible rubber or elastomer. In the field of hair care, preference is given to applying the composition to wet hair. The composition can be applied to the hair in any suitable form such as in thickened form by hand, in viscous orm, or by pump spray. The hair may be rinsed with water after the composition is applied to the nadir, but it is not necessary. The composition can be applied to the hair either before or after imposing the desired configuration on the hair. In either case, once the hair is in the desired configuration, it is only necessary that the coated hair be dried to provide a set that holds even when exposed to atmospheric humidity. The hair can be dried by allowing the volatile components of the composition to evaporate at room temperature. Of course, the hair can also be dried at elevated temperatures if desired. The composition after curing on the hair acts to hold any set in the hair even when exposed to atmospheric humidity, but when the hair is contacted directly with water such as by washing, the set is removed from the hair. Washing hair with a ,shampoo rather than just water is even more effective in removing the set from the hair. However, sufficient composition remains on the hair even after washing to act as a conditioner for the wet hair.Furthermore, if the hair is reset and dried, the composition again acts to hold the set in the hair although to a somewhat lesser extent thm after the initial applicatiòn of the composition.Although not intending to be bound by this theory, applicants believe that the cured composition when contacted directly with water such as by washing, reverts to the noncrosslinked, uncured polysiloxane which acts as the conditioner for the wet hair. When the hair is again dried however, applicants believe that the composition that remains on the hair again cures to sufficient extent to improve the set holding properties of the hair. The term hair as used in the present invention includes treated and untreated human hair, animal hair, and any type of fiber that needs gloss, ease of combing, set hold, feel of fullness, protection from elements such as sun, and reduced fly away. Treated hair includes hair that is chemically changed and or damaged by permanents and dyes. Setting hair means to curl, wave, control, or straighten hair. Now in order that those skilled in the art may better understand how the present invention can be practiced, the following examples are given by way of illustration and not by way of limitation. All parts and percents referred to herein are by weight unless otherwise specified.Example 1 Compositions were prepared for a final 9 1 weight ratio silicone to titanium acetylacetonate.

After unrolling the samples, one untreated sample was sprayed with Miss BreckE Ultimate Hold, aerosol hair spray manufactured by kmerican Cyanimid, and shall be denoted as E. The other untreat sample shall be denoted as F. The curl lengths were then measured and reported as a percent of initial curl length of the untreated sample. The lower the percent curl value, the better the curl retention. The curls were then left exposed to the relative humidity of the environment. The measurements were again taken after 6 hours, and after 3 days. The relative humidity of the environment over the 3 day testing period ranged from 66 to 73 at 230C.The results are as follows Sale Initial 6 hours 3 days A 86 105 123 B 64 100 127 C 68 105 123 D 82 95 120 E 91 120 127 F 100 136 145 In conclusion, all treatments had better curl retention than the untreated. As added benefits, the treated hair swatches developed more body, improved wet and dry feel, and improved wet and dry combing ease.Example 2 SamPle A, D and E from Example 1 were washed after the 3 day curl retention test period. Both swatches were dipped ten times and soaked for one minute in 200 grams of 3 weight percent PrellO, manufactured by Proctor and Gamble, Cincinnati, Ohio, Shampoo in water solution. The swatches were then dipped ten times each in two 2 700 ml distilled water bath. The hair was then rolled on an 11 16 outer diameter rollers and dried in a 70 C oven for 1F hours. The silicone treated samples again showed improved curl retention, combing ease and feel, demonstrating the treatment is substantive. SampleE did not retain its curl, nor did it demonstrate any combing ease. Example 3 The following compositions were prepared to demonstrate the polymers are effective at low concentrations.

The treated hair and a waterwetted untreated swatch, Sample I, were rolled on 11 16 outer diameter rollers and dried in a 70 C oven for 1d hours. After unrolling the curl lengths were then measured and reported as a percent of initial curl length of the untreated sample. The lower the percent curl value, the better the curl retention. The measurements were taken initially, after 6 hours, and after 1 day. The relative humidity of the environment was 62 at 230C The results are as follows Sample Initial 6 hours I days G 86 105 114 H l 95 105 119 H 2 86 110 1198 I 100 121 133 In conclusion, the treatments were effective in all cases and improvements were observed for combing ease, feel, and body.Example 4 A zirconium n propoxide solution was prepared by mixing 10 percent by weight zirconium n propoxide, 20 percent by weight glacial acetic acid, and 70 percent by weight water.

The polymer emulsion was then neutralized with A aqueous acetic acid to a pH of 6.8 and B hydrochloric acid to a pH of 6.6. The final compositions consisted of 28.6 grams of the neutralized polymer emulsion and 11.1 grams of the titanate solution and 60.3 grams water. Hair swatches, about 14 grams of VirginEuropean, natural brown, were then soaked in the solutions for two minutes, and then dipped ten times each in two 700 ml distilled water rinses. The treated hair and one waterxfetted untreated swatch sample C, was rolled on 11 16 outer diameter rollers and dried in a 70 C oven for 1k hours. After unrolling the samples, the curl lengths were then measured and reported as a percent improvement over the initial curl length. The higher the percent curl value, the better the curl retention. The measurements were taken after 1 hours and combing, 4 hours, and 1 day.The relative humidity range of the environment over this testing period was 41 to 51 percent at 760F. The results are as follows Sanole 1.5 hours 4 hrs 24 hrs. A 26 26 31 B 15 10 11 C O 0 0
