# Vacuum cleaning appliance.

## Abstract
A vacuum cleaning appliance comprises a low efficiency cyclone unit and a high efficiency cyclone unit connected in series. This enables both large and fine dirt particles to be dealt with. The low efficiency cyclone has a cylindrical casing 13 containing a frusto conical body portion 15 of the high efficiency cyclone, a pipe 14 connecting the casing 13 to the portion 15. A dirty air entry passage 11 extends up one side of the appliance and a clean air exit passage 21 descends the other side.
