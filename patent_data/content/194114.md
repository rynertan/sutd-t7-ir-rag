# Multi layered imaging member.

## Abstract
An electrophotographic imaging member is disclosed con sisting essentially of a supporting substrate 26 , a charge transport layer 24 substantially free of arsenic and tellurium and consisting essentially of selenium and a halogen selected from the group consisting of from about 4 parts per million by weight to about 13 parts per million by weight of chlorine and from about 8 parts per million by weight to about 25 parts per million by weight of iodine, and a photoconductive charge generator layer 22 comprising selenium, from about 5 per cent to about 20 percent by weight tellurium, from about 0.1 percent to about 4 percent by weight arsenic, and a halogen selected from the group consisting of up to about 70 parts per million by weight of chlorine and up to about 140 parts per mil lion by weight of iodine, one surface of the charge generator layer being in operative electrical contact with the charge transport layer and the other surface of the charge generator layer being exposed to the ambient atmosphere. This electro photographic imaging member may be employed in a process involving depositing a substantially uniform positive electro static charge on the exposed surface of the photoconductive charge generator layer of the electrophotographic imaging member, exposing the electrophotographic imaging member to an imagewise pattern of electromagnetic radiation to which the selenium tellurium arsenic alloy photoconductive charge generating layer is responsive whereby an electrostatic latent image is formed on the electrophotographic imaging member, developing the electrostatic image with electrostatically at tractable toner particles to form a toner particle deposit in im age configuration, and transferring the toner particle deposit to a receiving member. The process may be repeated numerous times in an automatic device.
