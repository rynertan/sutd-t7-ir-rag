# Exhaust silencer.

## Abstract
An exhaust silencer 10 has an inlet opening 12 and an outlet opening 14 spaced axially from the inlet opening 12 and includes a cylindrical shell 16 . A core 18 inside the shell 16 defines at least one axial passage 20 and has at least one helical baffle 21 defining a helical flow passage 22 around the axial flow passage 20 within the shell 16 . The axial flow passage 20 has a barrier 20.2 at its downstream end and has an upstream opening 20.1 aligned with the silencer inlet opening 12 . It also has an outlet 24 axially spaced from the axial passage inlet opening 20.1 , the said outlet 24 being directed transverse ly outwardly into the downstream half of the helical flow passage 22, at a region upstream from the barrier 20.2.
