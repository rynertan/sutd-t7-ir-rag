# Drillhole centerline determining device and its use for robot teaching and calibration.

## Abstract
A drillhole centerline determining device comprising interposer 7 having a central pocket enables a robot 5 robe the interposer to learn the location and orientation he desired drillhole. The interposer is a mushroom ped device with a planar head 10 and a stem 9 dimen ed to fit snugly in the hole to be drilled. The interposer, ddition to the planar head from which the perpendicular be calculated through multiple probes, has a central ket 11 concentric to the interposer stem. The method of using the drillhole centerline determin interposer is to place a number of such interposers ually in position in holes in a master part located in the envelope of the robot. The robot operator prepositions probe at an initial position facing the pocket of the poser for a drillhole locating sequence for the related hole. In sequence, the robot moves the probe from the position sufficient to clear the edge of the pocket and multiple probes determines the plane of the interposer platform. The robot then adjusts the yaw and pitch e probe to orient the probe orthogonal to the platform a vector parallel to the desired drillhole centerline . The robot, with orientation vector stored, now locates XYZ coordinates of the drillhole by pocket probing ac determining the epicenter of the pocket. With orientation vector pitch and yaw known, and with coordinates XYZ known, the drillhole is determined.
