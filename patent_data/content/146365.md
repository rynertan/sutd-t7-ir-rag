# CONDUCTOR GUIDE ARRANGEMENTS FOR OFFSHORE WELL PLATFORMS

## Abstract
A conductor guide arrangement is provided for conductors or tubular conduits 10 of an offshore well platform having a jacket 20 with an interior pile 4 for extending from a sea bed 1 to above a water level 3 which is over the sea bed. The conductor guide arrangement may include a first guide means 20 which comprises a plurality of vertically spaced supports which hold the conductors 10 within the pile 4 and is assembled in a plurality of sections wherein an upper support of each section is provided with removable bolt on units for supporting the first guide means 20 as successive sections are joined thereto. The conductor guide arrangement may include a second guide means 30 comprising a pair of circular plates which are positioned to rotate within an opening in a lower deck 6 of the platform and which are connected together and define a plurality of passages for receiving the conductors 10 that extend in the pile 4 . The connected plates are temporarily attached to the lower deck 6 for transport so that the second guide means 20 can be detached and rotated to align the passages with the intended positions for the conductors 10 , after which the second guide means 20 is permanently attached to the lower deck 6 . The con ductor guide arrangement may include a third guide means 40 which comprises a plurality of radially extending beams 44 and is supported on an upper deck 8 of the platform. The third guide means 40 also has passages for access to the conductors 10 and it too can be rotated into a position of alignment with the conductors 10 and thereafter perma nently fixed to the upper deck 8 .
