# Digital time division multiplex telecommunication system.

## Abstract
The system comprises bidirectional two wire transmission lines DL , branching nodes AK , subscriber stations TS including a subscriber modul TSM and generators SG and SR for generating and reflecting periodic synchronization information. The system enhances the number of subscribers connectable to the network and improves the system reliability against cable flaws, component failure and tapping of the information. In the system the time position addressed information only is sent on the direct path between the corresponding subscribers. Therefore one and the same channel can be used by a lot of simultaneous independent connections. For example connections between the subscribers A and B resp. as well as between E and F resp., are established via channel 1. For a connection of subscribers C and D another channel must be chosen, eg. channel 2. The architecture of the system allows its realization as a line , ring , branched , star and mixed structure.
