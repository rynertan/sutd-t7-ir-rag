# Process for producing aliphatic copolyesteramide and tube moulded therefrom.

## Abstract
An aliphatic copolyesteramide having a high degree of polymerization is prepared by heating a mixture of A ester forming components comprising a aliphatic diols with 2 to 6 carbon atoms and b aliphatic dicarboxylic acids with 9 to 12 carbon atoms and B amide forming compo nents chosen from a aliphatic Ï‰ aminocarboxylic acids having 11 or 12 carbon atoms and b equimolar salts of aliphatic diamines with 6 to 12 carbon atoms and aliphatic dicarboxylic acids with 9 to 12 carbon atoms, at tempera tures of 150 to 260 C, under a substantially atmospheric pressure, in the presence of catalyst and in the substantial absence of water, and subsequently heating the resulting esterified product at temperatures of 200 to 300 C under a reduced pressure. The obtained copolyesteramide can be formed into various moulded articles, in particular such as tubes, having excellent flexibility, toughness, shapability, chemical resistance, heat resistance, hydrolysis resistance and fatigue resistance.
