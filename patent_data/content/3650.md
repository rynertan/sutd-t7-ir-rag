# Electrical plug and a telecommunications distribution assembly comprising such a plug.

## Abstract
An electrical plug 42 for mating with a multi contact female connector 8 on a telecommunications distribution panel, comprises electrical terminals 56 arranged in back to back relationship in compartments 60 of an insulating housing 44 , each terminal having a wire receiving portion 47 and a contact blade 54 . So that the lateral dimensions of the plug 42 are small enough to allow a different plug 42 to be mated with each pair of contacts of the female connector, each terminal 56 is substantially uniplanar, the contact blades 54 being contained in channels in a H section portion of the plug housing 44 , the planes of the blades 54 being parallel with the side walls of the channels.
