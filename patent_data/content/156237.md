## Description
Casings can be improved, particularly with respect to receptivity to oil base or flexigraphic inks by applying to the casing while still in the gel state, prior to drying, an aqueous solution ot epot9 substituted re8in resin consisting of a water solubles thermosetting reaction product of an epihalohydrin and a, polysecondary amine. The application of such coatings to regenerated cellulose casings is described in U. S. Patent Application i,764,350. U.S. Patent 4,289,171 discloses the preparation of sausage casings and the like by coating a fibrous web with a cationic resin binder, such as the reaction product of epichlorohydrin with a Polyaminopolyamide in admixture with a coloring chemical substance and subsequently applying a viscose solution to the pre treated fibrous web and reqenerating the viscose. It is further known from U.S. Patent 4,238,234 that stable, aqueous Printing inks for painting on non woven fabrics, such as tissue paper may be prepared from the combination of an anionic dye and a cat ionic fixing agent prepared by reacting a Polyepihalohydrin with an excess of an aliphatic polyamine ,ich contains at least one primary or at least two secondary aino groups, which may bear one or more hydroxyl groups and which has a molecular weight not greater than 200. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a process for the coloring of cellulosic film, such as a cellulosic food casing, which comprises coating at least a portion of at least one surface of a PROCESS FOR COLOR COATING CELLULOSIC CASINGS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a cellulosic casing suitable f t use as a food casing and to a method for color coating cellulosic casings. Regenerated cellulose casings prepared from a cellulosic solution such as viscose are commonly used for encasing food products such as sausages, bologna, cheese and the like.In the manufacture of such casings a viscose may be extruded as a tie through an annular die into a coagulating and regenerating bath. In another method, viscose may be coated onto a tubular roll of paper and the cellulose regenerated. The tube is then treated in an acid bath, then washed to remove by products impregnated with a softening agent such as glycerine and dried. Th the preparation of many food products, it is desirable to color the food product and or the food casing employed in order to increase consumer appeal of the encased food product. Dyes that are normally used to color or dye regenerated cellulose are those used in the.dyeing of cotton and rayon. Thus, the selection of dyes available for this purpose is limited.Moreover, the dyed regenerated cellulose casing commonly exhibits some degree of dye rub off or crocking, particularly upon rewetting prior to stuffing. It is known that the surface of regenerated cellulose gel cellulose film with a coating composition comprising til aqueous solution of a water soluble anionic dye and a water soluble therrnosetting cationic polymer and drying the resultant coated gel film to provide a dried regenerated cellulose film having on at least a portion of at least one surface thereof t colored thermoset polymeric coating. The coating compositions which may be employed in the preparation of colored coatings on cellulose films in accordance with this invention are essentially homogeneous aqueous solutions or suspensions of a cationic tbermosetting resin and an anionic dye. The amounts and proportions of resin and dye in the coating solution may vary considerably, For ex nple, the resin and dye may be present in a weight ratlo of about 200 1 or higher to about 2 1 or less and in amounts sufficient to provide an aqueous solution containing about 3 or less to about 30 or greater weight percent total resin and dye. In addition to the resin and dye, the coating composition may contain various other adjuvants and processing aids known in the art, including.for example, viscosity control agents, such as polyvinyl alcohol or methyl cellulose, surfactants such as sulfated polyoxyethylene alkylphenols, and the likc. There may also be included small amounts of the casing plasticizing agent.such as glycerol, to preclude leaching of the plasticizer from the casing during application of the coating. The cationic thermosettin resins suitable for use in the coating process of this invention are water soluble epoxy substituted polysecondary amine resins prepared by the section of an epihalohydrin, e.g., epichlorohydrin, with polymers containing a plurality of BE groups and having an epoxide equivalent weight of at least about 100 and preferably less than about 2000 as determined by reaction with mercaptoethanol in the procedure described in Bates APPI, 52, No. 6, 169, page1163 Examples of such resinous materials include water soluble, thermosettinge reaction product of epihalohydrin and a polyamine, selected from the group consisting of polyamide amines, such as condensation reaction products of a polyalkylene polyamine, e.g., diethylene triamine and triethylene tetraamine, with an aliphatic dicarboxylic acid, e.g., succintc acid and adipic acid, and polyurea amines, such as Condensation reaction products of the de8cribed polyalkylene polysmines and aliphatic diisocyanates, e.g., 4,41 methylene bis cyclohexyl isocyanate . Typic2llly, the resins employed will have a water solubility of at least 5r at 250 Celsius and will be capable of forming aqueous solutions having relatively low viscosities at concentrations suitable for the process of this invention. Generally, the viscosity of a 1 aqueous solution of a suitable resin will be less than about 100 centipoises at 250 Celsius. A particularly preferred cationic thermosetting resin for use in the present invention because of its stability, low viscosity and durability at neutral pY.s to form non film coatings is Kymene 557 also called Hercules Resin 2000 , a water soluble, thermosetting epoxy substituted polymer marketed by Hercules, Inc., Kymene 357 is the reaction product of epichlorohydrin and an adipic acid diethylene triamine polyamide having an epoxiie equivalent content of about 450 500 as determined by react with mercaptoethanol in the procedure described in Bates,TAPPI, 52, No. 6, 1969, Page 1163 , a 83eldahl nitrogen content of about 13 and a viscosity at a 10 concentration in water of about 30 centipoises at 250 Celsius. The anionic dyestuffs suitable for use in the process of this invention include for example, those dyes containing acid groups such as sulfonic and or carboxylic acid groups and are described in the literature under various headings or classifications, such as Acid Dye8 , Direct Dyes and Reactive Dye8 . Typical anionic dyes that may be employed include AcidBlue 1, Red 40, Yellow 5, Yellow 6 and the like. In the final dried coating of this invention the anionic dyes provide a clear, water fast color.Mixtures of dyes may be employed to vary the shade and or color of the final coating. Thus, for example, an orange color similar to that known as Sultan is achieved by employing a dye mixture of approximately equal parts of Red 40 and Yellow 6. A green color is achieved with mixtures of Blue 1 and Yellow 5. Furthermore, the final color or shade may be varied by the combined effect of one or more dyes or colorants in the foodstuff or in the cellulose casing and one or more dyes or colorants in the cationic thermosetting resin coating. The aqueous coating compositions of this invention may be applied to the gel film in a 1 nown manner using conventional methods such as rolling, brushing, dipping, spraying d the like. The coated film may then be dried and the resin curid,Dy heating in air. In practice, the coatings are typically oven dried at temperatures of about 70 2000 Celsius to a coating having a moisture content of about 3 to about 10 perct9n in a particular embodiment . of the invention, the employed is a pR sensitive indicator dye.The use of a pH sensitive indicator dye, such as Methyl Red results in a coating composition which will vary in color according to the pH of its environment. Thus, for example, the condition, as represented by pR of a stuffed meat product can be monitored by observing the color of the coating. In this manner, ageing of the encased food product due, for example, to the action of acid producing bacteria, is readily observable. Among the pE Sensitive indicator dyes that may be employed are Methyl Red,Alizarin Yellow and the like. The following specific examples are provided to further illustrate the invention and the manner in which it may be carried out. it will be understood, however, that the specific details given in the exanples have been chosen for purposes o illustration and are not to be construed as a limitation on the invention In the examples, unless otherwise indicated, all parts and percentages are by weight and all temperatures are in degrees Celsius.EXAMPLE I A regenerated cellulose film sheet was prepared by passing viscose through an extrusion slit into a coagulating 2nd regenerating bath.
