# A linear drive arrangement.

## Abstract
A linear drive arrangement comprises a prime mover which is capable of rotatably driving a screw threaded rod 1 . A carriage 2 is mounted on the rod 1 and carries a plurality of bristles 6 , for example in the form of a brush 3 , which bristles 6 contact the surface of the screw threaded rod 1 . Rotation of the rod 1 by the prime mover causes the bristles 6 to follow screw thread of the rod 1 to drive the carriage 2 along the rod 1 . The advantage of this is that no clutch mechanism is required as if force is applied to the carriage 2 either to prevent it from moving along the rod 1 or to push it along the rod 1 , the bristles 6 will flex to ride over the screw threaded surface of the rod 1 .
