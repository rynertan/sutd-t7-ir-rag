# CONCRETE PUMPING DEVICE

## Abstract
Pumping device for pasty materials, particularly con crete, of the type comprising two cylinders which, by way of an S shaped valve, are connected alternatively to a delivery pipe and to a hopper placed above said valve. In said device, the housing or tank 7 of the valve is formed by two flat parallel headwalls 8 , one of which holds a first support 13 for the control shaft of the S shaped valve 5 , telescopic cylinder ends 11 connecting said valve with the pumping cylinders 1 , and ribs ending into four ears 12 which make it possible to rotate the tank about vertical axes, while the other wall holds a second valve support 18 and a flange 20 of connection to the delivery pipe 4 by two partially inclined sidewalls 9 which are radiused to the bottom and by a bottom cover formed by a cylindrical wall, the axis of which coincides with the valve rotation axis. Moreover, in the device described, the axis of the pumping cylinders is positioned higher than the valve rotation axis and the delivery pipe.
