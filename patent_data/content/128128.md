# A HANDLE ARRANGEMENT FOR VIBRATING MACHINES

## Abstract
A handle arrangement for vibrating machines has its shaft and operating members 10 and 11, respectively inter connected by means of one or more spring elements 16 and a spring deflection restricting device 14, 19 . According to the invention, the mass of the operating member 11 and the spring stiffness of the spring element 16 are so adapted to one another and to the vibration or interfering frequency of the vibrating machine that the relationship of said frequency and the characteristic frequency of the operating member with regard to translational and rotational movements respectively along and about the axis of the operating member and respectively along and about two directions at right angles to the axis and also to one another, is 2.
