# Vehicle speed control device.

## Abstract
A tachograph comprises a casing 1,2 which houses a speed indicator 4 , an odometer 6 and styli 8a,8b for respectively recording speed and distance travelled. A stepper motor 22 drives the speed indicator 4 and speed recording stylus 8a . A stepper motor 23 drives the odometer 6 and distance recording stylus 8b . A pulse generator 25 provides an input, proportional to vehicle speed, to a microprocessor 16 which computes speed and distance on the basis of the pulse input and a correction factor 26 relating to vehicle characteristics in order to drive the stepper motors 22, 23 . The microprocessor 16 is also responsive to a preset maximum top speed reference 27 and a driver selected top speed reference 28 to provide an output to an actuator 30 in order to control the vehicle speed.
