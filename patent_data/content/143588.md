# DISTRIBUTING DEVICE

## Abstract
A liquid spraying device, e.g. for spraying fertilizer onto a lawn has a control unit 25. The control unit, mounted adjacent a wheel 11 of the liquid spraying device, contains a switch SW2 which opens and closes in response to the close passage of a magnet 28 mounted on the wheel. The repeated operation of the switch enables control circuitry within the control unit to illuminate a red light emitting diode LED2 if the speed is greater than the selected speed, or to illuminate a green light emitting diode LED1 if the speed is too slow. When at, or close to, the selected speed neither light emitting diode is illu minated.
