## Description
OVERLIED ELECTRIC TRUISMISSION SYSTEStS This invention relates to overhead electric transmission systems of the kind in which one or more than one overhead electric conductor is freely supported in long lengths between spaced pylons, towers, masts or other supports. The invention is particularly concerned with overhead electric transmission systems of this kind in which the overhead electric conductor, or at least one of the overhead electric conductors, includes at least one optical guide for the transmission of the ultra violet, visible and infra red regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, which regions, for convenience, hereinafter will all be included in the generic term light . One form of overhead electric conductor including at least one optical guide for use in the communications field adapted for transmission of light having a wavelength within the range 0.8 to 1.3 micrometres, is described and claimed in the Complete Specification of our cognate UKPatent Applications Nows. 20234 77 and 2861 78 SerialNo.1598438 and comprises at least one layer of helically wound bare elongate elements of metal or metal alloy, at least one compartment within and extending throughout the length of the overhead conductor and, loosely housed in the elongate comparment or in an least one of the elongate compartments, at least one separate optical fibre and or at least one optical bundle. By the expression optical bundle is neant a group of optical fibres or a group of fibres including at least one optical fibre and at least one non optical reinforcing fibre or other reinforcing elongate member. Each optical fibre of the optical bundle may be used independently as a separate light guide, each with its own modulated light source and detector, or a plurality of optical fibres of a bundle may be used together as a single light guide, with a single light source. It will be appreciated that, in an overhead electric transmission system of the aforesaid kind in which the overhead electric conductor, or at least one of the overhead electric conductors, includes at least one optical guide for the transmission of light, it is necessary at spaced positions along the overhead electric transmission system to effect a joint between the optical guides of two overhead electric conductors suspended from a tower or other support or to effect a joint between the optical guide of an overhead electric conductor suspended from a tower or other support and an optical guide of a cable extending to a substation or other location. According to the present invention we provide, in an overhead electric transmission system of the aforesaid kind in which the overhead electric conductor, or at least one of the overhead electric conductors, includes one or more than one optical guide comprising at least one optical fibre for the transmission of light, an optical guide joint in which each optical guide connected at the joint passes into a housing which is directly or indirectly mounted above the ground on a tower or other support, which accommodates the optical fibre joint or joints and which is at least partially filled with an electrically insulating medium in a fluid or semi fluid state to an extent sufficient to surround the optical fibre joint or joints, each optical guide effecting a substantially fluid tight seal with a wall of the housing or entering the housing in such a way that risk of water or other liquid entering the housing is substantially eliminated. The optical guides connected at the joint may be optical guides of two overhead electric conductors suspended from a tower or other support, or one of the optical guides may be an optical guide of an overhead electric conductor suspended from a tower or other support and the other of the optical guides may be an optical guide of a cable extending to a sub station or other location. Preferably, where one or each optical guide connected at the joint is a component part of a live overhead electric conductor, the wall of the housing through which the optical guide or guides passes or pass is of electrically conductive metal or metal alloy and, preferably also, the internal surface of the housing in at least the vicinity of said wall carries a layer of electrically conductive metal or metal alloy so as to reduce electric stress concentration in that part of the housing.To eliminate risk that rain water or other liquid will enter the housing where the optical guide of an overhead electric conductor passes through the wall of the housing, preferably the optical guide enters the housing through a preformed tube of metal or metal alloy, one end of which is a substantially fluid tight seal in a hole in said wall of the housing and which is of such a shape that the other end of the tube is directed downwardly the overhead electric conductor may itself pass through the preformed tube into the housing or the overhead electric conductor may be cut back and the exposed length of optical guide may pass through the preformed tube into the housing. The end of the tube sealed in the wall of the housing may protrude into the housing and may be so shaped as to form a stress cone. Preferably, the housing is of substantially elongate form and is preferably so mounted that its longitudinal axis is vertical or approximately vertical.Where The optical guides connected at the joint are optical guides of two overhead electric conductors, preferably the optical guides enter the housing side by side through the upper end wall of the housing. Where one of the optical guides connected at the joint is the optical guide of a cable extending to a sub station or other location, this optical guide preferably passes into the housing through the bottom end wall of the housing. In this case, preferably the bottom end wall of the housing is of electrically conductive metal or metal alloy and is earthed. The circumferentially extending wall of the housing is preferably of porcelain or ot ner electrically insulating material and may be provided at spaced positions along its length with outwardly extending circumferential sheds. The electrically insulating medium contained in the housing preferably comprises a grease like material, such as a petroleum based insulating grease, a mineral insulating oil, such as an oil used in transformers and ol filled electric cables, a silicone oil or compound, or an insulating gas, eg. SF6. inhere the electrically insulating medium is a a mineral insulating oil, a silicone oil or compound or an insulating gas, each optical guide may effect a substantially fluid tight seal with a wall of the housing and the oil or gas may be maintained at a positive pressure by a known device. The or each optical fibre joint may be suspended within the housing and, in this case, abutting end of opticl fibres are preferably jointed by a fusion technique.Alternatively, the or each optical fibre joint may be rigidly supported within the housing and, in this case, abutting ends of optical fibres may be either be jointed by a fusion technique or held in abutting relationship by mechanical means. In addition to the optical fibre joint or joints, the housing of the optical guide joint may also accommodate regenerators and or other ancillary equipment associated with the optical communication system. The invention is further illustrated, by way of example, by the following descripton with reference to drawings, in which Figure 1 is a diagrammatic side view of a tower of an overhead electric transmission system showing mounted on the tower, the housings of three optical guide joints.between overhead electric conductors suspended from the tower Figure 2 is a diagrammatic sectional side view of a preferred optical guide joint between optical guides of two overhead electric conductors suspended from the tower shown in Figure 1, and Figure 3 is a diagrammatic side view of a preferred optical guide joint between an optical guide of a live overhead electric conductor suspended from a tower and the optical guide of an optical cable extending to a sub station. Referring to Figures 1 and 2, the overhead electric transmission system comprises three phase conductors 1, 2 and 3 and an earth conductor 4 freely supported in long lengths between towers 5 at spaced positions along the system. Each phase conductor 1, 2 and 3 has a central bore extending throughout its length in which is loosely housed an optical guide 18 comprising an elongate plastics body having a bore in which is loosely housed an optical fibre.Phase conductors 1 on opposite sides of a tower 5 are freely suspended from a cross arm 6 on the tower by insulator strings 11 which are connected to the conductors by conventional wedge type fittings 14 phase conductors 2 on opposite sides of the tower are freely suspended from a cross arm 7 by insulator strings 12 connected to the conductors by wedge type fittings 15 and phase conductors 3 on opposite sides of the tower are freely supported from a cross arm 8 by insulator strings 13 connected to the conductors by wedge type fittings 16. Electrical connection between phase conductors 1, 2 and 3 on opposite sides of the tower 5 is effected by conventional jumper cables not shown . From each wedge type fitting 14, 15 and 16, the phase conductors 1, 2 and 3 each passes through a tubular metal swan neck 25 into a housing 21 where the optical guide joint 20 is effected.The housing 21 of the optical guide joint 20 between the optical guides 18 of the conductors 1 is supported on the cross arm 7 the housing 21 of the optical guide joint 20 between the optical guides 18 of the conductors 2 is supported on the cross arm 8 and the housing 21 of the optical guide joint 20 between the optical guides 18 of the conductors 3 is supported on an auxiliary crossarm 9. Detail of the optical guide joint 20 between the optical guides 18 of the conductors 1 will now be described with reference to Figure 2. The optical guide joint 20 comprises a cylindrical tubular housing 21 of porcelain which is mounted on the cross arm 7 with its axis substantially vertical and which is closed at its lowermost end by a metal end plate 22 and is closed at its uppermost end by a metal end cap 23. The circumferentially extending wall of the housing 21 has outwardly extending circumferential sheds 24 at spaced positions along its length. The metal end plate 22 is earthed. At diametrically spaced positions of the metal end cap 23, two tubular metal swan necks 25 protude through the end cap into the interior of the housing 21, each swan neck effecting a substantially fluid tight seal with the cap.The end of each swan neck 25 protuding into the housing 21 is shaped to form a stress cone 26 the other end 27 of each swan neck 25 is directed downwardly to eliminate risk of water or other liquid entering the housing 21 through the swan neck. The internal surface of the circumferentially extending wall of the housing 21 adjacent the metal end cap 23 carries a metal coating 28 to reduce electric stress concentration in that part of the housing. The part of each phase conductor 1 extending from the wedge type fitting 14 passes through one of the swan necks 25 into the housing, each conductor being cut back at a position adjacent the stress cone 26 so that a length of optical guide 18 is suspended downwardly within the housing. An optical fibre joint 30 is effected between the optical fibres of the optical guides 18 by a fusion welding technique and is suspended within the housing 21.The interior of the housing is substantially filled with petroleum jelly 29. The optical guide joints between the optical guides 18 of the conductors 2 and between the optical guides 18 of the conductors 3 are substantially identical to the optical guide joint shown in Figure 2. Figure 3 shows a diagrammatic side view of an optical guide joint between an optical guide 32 of an overhead phase conductor 31 suspended from a tower not shown and the optical guide 35 of an optical cable 34 extending to a sub station not shown . The optical guide joint comprises a cylindrical tubular housing 41 of porcelain which is mounted on a cross arm 37 of the tower with its axis substantially vertical and which is closed at its lowermost end by a metal end plate 42 and at its uppermost end by a metal end cap 43. Outwardly extending circumferential sheds 44 are provided at spaced positions along the length of the circumferentially extending wall of the housing 41.Protruding through the metal end cap 43 into the housing 41 is a tubular metal swan neck 45 which effects a fluid tight seal with the cap. At the end of the swan neck 45 protruding into the housing 41, the swan neck is shaped to form a stress cone 46 the other end 47 of the swan neck is directed downwardly to reduce risk that water will enter the housing. The internal surface of the circumferentially extending wall of the housing 41 adjacent the metal end cap 43 carries a metal coating 48. The phase conductor 31 passes through the swan neck 45 into the housing 41, a substantially fluid tight seal 49 being effected between the conductor and the swan neck in the region of the metal end cap 43. The optical cable 34 passes through and effects a fluid tight seal 50 with the metal end plate 42. Within the housing 41 the phase conductor 31 and the optical cable 34 are cut back and the exposed lengths of the optical guides 32 and 35 extend to an optical fibre joint 60 where the optical fibres of the optical guides are jointed end to end by a fusion welding technique. The housing 41 is filled with mineral insulating oil 51 which is maintained at a positive pressure by means of a pressure tank 52.
