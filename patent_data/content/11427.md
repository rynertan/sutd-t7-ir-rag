# Process for making motor fuel.

## Abstract
A process for making anhydrous alcohol denatured with gasoline for ready mixing with additional gasoline to make gasohol and in which aqueous alcohol 24 is introduced into a dehydration drying column 1 along with gasoline. The alcohol, containing gasoline, flows into the lower zone of the drying column and is recovered as a substantially non aqueous alcohol gasoline mixture 4 which may be clas sified as completely denatured alcohol. The rising vapors of the gasoline entrain the water and some alcohol as azeo tropes which flow out the top of the column as vapors 6 which are condensed to form a gasoline layer 9 which is returned to the column and a water layer 15 which is removed. Additional water is also removed by decantation on the top several trays of the drying column where it is present as a separate liquid phase. The process also includes utilizing the heat to strip the alcohol from dilute fermented wort for the recovery and reconcentration of the alcohol in the water layers recycled from the drying column while pre venting any gasoline from contaminating the fermented feed product and insuring that gasoline is present as a contami nent in all alcoholic streams. Provision is also made to insure that all light ends in the incoming gasoline are contained in the alcohol gasoline product.
