# Process for solvent dewaxing waxy bright stock using a combination polydialkylfumarate vinylacetate copolymer and wax naphthalene condensate dewaxing aid.

## Abstract
This invention relates to processes for solvent dewax ing bright stock waxy raffinate oil employing a dewaxing aid which dewaxing aid is a mixture of a polydialkylfumarate vinyl acetate copolymers and b a wax naphthalene con densate. The dewaxing aid mixture is a mixture of a poly dialkylfumarate vinyl acetate copolymer having a number average molecular weight in the range of from about 1,000 to 100,000, preferably, 5,000 or greater, possessing alkyl side chain moieties of from C₁₆ C₂₄ in length excluding branching with an average pendent side chain length of predominantly i.e. 50 C₂₀ and b a wax naphthalene condensation product having a number average molecular weight of about 1,000 and greater. The combination a plus b may be employed in a weight ratio within the range of from about 45 55 to 1 100, preferably about 1 3, and at an aid dose level ranging from about 0.005 to 2.0 wt. , preferably 0.01 to 0.2 wt. active ingredient.
