# Apparatus and process for separating solid particles from a liquid suspension and or for the purification or leaching of solid particles.

## Abstract
Apparatus for separating solid particles from a liquid suspension and or purification or leaching of solid particles, whereby a cylindrical column 1 is provided with a rotating scraper 4 for the disintegration of a washed compacted bed 2 at one side of the column, means 8 for supplying liquid suspension and a screening device 3 at the other side of the column, which screening device is selectively permeable for the liquid phase. The process for separating the solid particles in the column is based on the pulsating movement of the compact ed bed in this column to which a liquid suspension, under withdrawal of liquid phase, is supplied batchwise at one end of the column and the washed compacted bed is disinte grated, while the product of this disintegration is removed at the opposite end of the column and the washfront in the compacted bed is moved between two limits in the compact ed bed.
