## Description
TITLE OF. THE INVENTIONRENIN INHIBITORY PEPTIDES HAVING PHE13 DELETIONBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of The Invention The present invention is concerned wit novel peptides which inhibit renin. The present invention is also concerned with pharmaceutical compositions containing the novel peptides of the present invention as active ingredients, with methods of treating renin associated hypertension and hyperaldosteronism, with aiagnostic methods which utilize the novel peptides of the present invention, and with methods of preparing the novel peptides of the present invention. Renin is a proteolytic enzyme of molecular weight about 40,000, produced and secreted by the kidney. It is secreted by the juxtaglomerular cells and acts on tne plasma substrate, angiotensinogen, to split off the decapeptide angiotensin I, which is converted to the potent pressor agent angiotensin II.Thus, the renin angiotensin system plays an important role in normal cardiovascular homeostasis and in some forms of hypertension. In the past, attempts to modulate or manipulate the renin angiotensin system have met with success in the use of inhibitors of angiotensin I converting enzyme. In view of this success, it seems reasonable to conclude that a specific inhibitor of the limiting enzymatic step that ultimately regulates angiotensin II production, the action of renin on its substrate, would be at least equally successful.Thus, an effective inhibitor of renin has been long sought as both a therapeutic agent and as an investigative tool.2. Brief Description of the Prior Art There has been substantial interest in the synthesis of useful renin,inhibitors for many decades and the following table lists the major classes of renin inhibitors that have been studied, as well as their inhibition constantsClass Ki M Renin antibody probably 10 6 Pepstatin 10 6 10 7Phospholipids 10 3 Substrate analogs Tetrapeptides Octa to tridecapeptides 10 5 10 6 Umezawa et al., in J. Antibiot. Tokyo 23 259 262, 1970, reported the isolation of a peptide from actinomyces that was an inhibitor of aspartyl proteases such as pepsin, cathepsin D, and renin.This peptide, known as pepstatin, was found by Gross et al., Science 175 656, 1971, to reduce blood pressure in vivo after the injection of hog renin into nephrectomized rats. However, pepstatin has not found wide application as an experimental agent because of its limited solubility and its inhibition of a variety of other acid proteases in addition to renin. The structure of pepstatin is shown below EMI3.1 To date, many efforts have been made to prepare a specific renin inhibitor based on substrate analogy. Since the human renin substrate has only recently been elucidated Tewksbury et al., Circulation 59, 60, Supp. II 132, Oct. 1979 , heretofore substrate analogy has been based on the known pig renin substrate.While the human and pig renin substrates are not the same, the substrate analogy based on pig renin has always been considered acceptable in the art as predictive of human renin inhibitory activity because of the closely related activity of the two renins. Thus, while pig renin does not cleave the human renin substrate, human renin, on the other hand, does cleave the pig renin substrate. See Poulsen et al., Biochim. Biophys. Acta 452 533 537, 1976 and Skeggs, Jr. et al., J. Exp. Med. 106 439 453, 1957. Moreover, the human renin inhibitory activity of the peptides of the present invention most active in inhibiting pig renin has been confirmed, thus providing further evidence of this accepted correlation between human and pig renin activity. It has been found, for example, using pig renin substrate analogy, that the octapeptide sequence extending from histidine 6 through tyrosine 13 has kinetic parameters essentially the same as those of the full tetradecapeptide renin substrate. The amino acid sequence of the octapeptide in pig renin substrate is as follows 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 His Pro Phe His Leu Leu Val Tyr Renin cleaves this substrate between Leu10.and Leull Kokubu et awl., Biochem. Pharmacol. 22 3217 3223, L973, synthesized a number of analogs of the tetrapeptide found between residues 10 to 13, but while inhibition could be shown, inhibitory constants were only of the order of l03M. Analogs of a larger segment of renin substrate were also synthesized Burton et al.,Biochemistry 14 3892 3898, 1975, and Poulsen et al.,Biochemistry 12 3877 3882, 1973. Two of the major obstacles which had to be overcome to obtain an effective renin inhibitor useful in vivo were lack of solubility and weak binding large inhibitory constant . Modifications to increase solubility soon established that the inhibitory properties of the peptides are markedly dependent on the hydrophobicity of various amino acid residues, and that increasing solubility by replacing lipophilic amino acids with hydrophilic isosteric residues becomes counterproductive. Other approaches to increasing solubility have had limited success. Various modifications designed to increase binding to renin have also been made, but here too, with only limited success.For a more detailed description of past efforts to prepare an effective inhibitor of renin, see Haber and Burton,Fed. Proc. Fed. Am. Soc. Exp. Biol. 38 2768 2773, 1979. For other articles describing previous efforts to devise renin inhibitors, see Marshall,Federation Proc. 35 2494 2501, 1976 Burton et al.,Proc.

The inhibitory peptides of the present invention may be better appreciated in terms of substrate analogy from the following illustration of Formula I alongside the octapeptide sequence of a portion of the pig renin substrate, which renin cleaves betweenLeu10 and Leu11 His Pro Phe His Leu Leu Val Tyr 5 6 T 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 EMI14.1 Statine As can be seen, a unique aspect and essential feature of the present invention is the substitution of the single statine amino acid component for the double amino acid sequence Leu10 Leu11 in theendogenous pig renin substrate. It is believed that substitution of statine for both leucine amino acids rather than just one leucine results in an improved substrate analogy due to the greater linear extent of statine as compared to a single leucine component.Thus, statine more closely approximates Leu Leu in linear extent, and thereby provides a better fits to the renin enzyme. The inhibitory peptides of the present invention may also be better appreciated in terms of substrate analogy from the following illustration ofFormula I alongside the octapeptide sequence of a portion of the human renin substrate, which renin cleaves between Leu10 and Valll His Pro Phe His Leu Leu Val Tyr 5 6 7 8 9 10 12 13 14 EMI15.1 Statine As can be seen, a unique aspect and essential feature of the present invention is tne substitution of the single statine amino acid component for the double amino acid sequence LeulO Valll in the endogenous human renin substrate.It is believed that substitution of statine for both the leucine and valine amino acids rather than lust the leucine results in an improved substrate analogy due to the greater linear extent of statine as compared to a single leucine component.Thus, statine more closely approximates Leu Val in linear extent, and thereby provides a better fit to tne human renin enzyme. In the endogenous substrate it. is also preferred to substitute Leu for Val12 and Phe for Tyr13 in. order to enhance the inhibitory activity of the resulting peptide.

The pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable preparation, for example as a sterile injectable aqueous or oleagenous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non tosic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3 butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer s solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono or diglycerides.In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectibles. The peptides of this invention may also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration of the drug.

Such materials are cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols. Dosage levels of the order of 2 to 35 grams per day are useful in the treatment of the above indicated conditions. For example, renin associated hypertension and hyperaldosteronism are effectively treated by the administration of from 30 milligrams to 0.5 grams of the compound per kilogram of body weight per day. The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. It will be understood, however, that the specific dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, route of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination and the severity of the particular disease undergoing therapy. Thus, in accordance with the present invention there is further provided a pharmaceutical composition for treating renin associated hypertension and hyperaldosteronism, comprising a pharmaceutical carrier and a therapeutically effective amount of a peptide of the formula EMI19.1 wherein A, B, D, R1, R2, R3, R4, and E have the same meaning as recited further above for FormulaI wherein all of the asymmetric carbon atoms have anS configuration, except for those in the B, D, and E substituents, which may have an S or R configuration and a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.

For this purpose the novel peptides of the present invention may be administered in a single dose of from 0.1 to 10 mg per kg of body weight. Both in vivo and in vitro methods may be employed. In the in vivo method, a novel peptide of the present invention is administered to a patient, preferably by intravenous in3ection, altnough parenteral administration is also suitable, at a hypotensive dosage level and as a single dose, and there may result a transitory fall in blood pressure.This fall in blood pressure, if it occurs, indicates supranormal plasma renin levels. An in vitro method which may be employed involves incubating a body fluid, preferably plasma, with a novel peptide of the present invention and, after aeproteinization, measuring the amount of angiotensin II produced in nephrectomized, pentoliniumtreated rats. Another in vitro method involves mixing the plasma or otner body fluid witn a novel peptide of the present invention and injecting the mixture into a test animal. The difference in pressor response with and without added peptide is a measure of the renin content of the plasma. Pepstatin may be employed in the methods described above as an active control. See, e.g.,.U.S. Patent Nos. 3,784,686 and 3,873,681 for a description of the use of pepstatin in diagnostic methods of this type. The novel peptides of the present invention may be prepared in accordance with well known procedures for preparing peptides from their constituent amino acids, which will De aescribed in more detail below. The unusual amino acid, statine, may be prepared in accordance with the procedure described by Rich et. al., J.

Med. Chem. 23 27 33 1980 . The cyclohexylalanine analog of statine, 3ski 4S 4 amino 5 cyclohexyl 3 hydroxypentanoic acid ACHPA can be prepared by catalytic hydrogenation using H2 Rh on alumina, or other suitable catalyst of the BOC AHPPA, prepared as described in the paragraph immediately above. Alternatively, this and similar statine analogs can be prepared in accordance with the procedure described for statine, where theBOC Leu starting material is replaced with the amino acid containing the desired side chain. Thus,BOC ACHPA can also be prepared starting from BOC Lcyclohexylalanine, itself prepared, for example, by catalytic reduction of BOC Phe, in the same manner as described for BOC AHPPA. The novel inhibitory peptides of the present invention are prepared by using the solid phase sequential synthesis technique. In the following description several abbreviated designations are used for the amino acid components, certain preferred protecting groups, reagents and solvents. The meanings of such abbreviated designations are given below in Table I.

AcOH acetic acidC chloroformDMF dimethylformamideE ethyl acetate methanolP pyridineTHF tetrahydrofuranW water The synthesis of the peptides of the present invention by the solid phase technique is conducted in a stepwise manner on chloromethylated resin. The resin is composed of fine beads 20 70 microns in diameter of a synthetic resin prepared by copolymerization of styrene with 1 2 percent divinylbenzene.The benzene rings in the resin are chloromethylated in a Friedel Crafts reaction with chloromethyl methyl ether and stannic chloride. The Friedel Crafts reaction is continued until the resin contains O.5 to 5 mmoles of chlorine per gram of resin. The amino acid selected to be the C terminal amino acid of the linear peptide is converted to its amino protected derivative. The carboxyl group of the selected C terminal amino acid is bound covalently to the insoluble polymeric resin support, as for example, as the carboxylic ester of the resin bonded benzyl chloride present in chloromethyl substituted polystyrene divinylbenzene resin. After the amino protecting group is removed, the amino protected derivative of the next amino acid in the sequence is added along with a coupling agent, such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. The amino acid reactant may be employed in the form of a carboxyl activated amino acid such as ONP ester, an amino acid azide, and the like. Deprotection and addition of successive amino acids is performed until the desired linear peptide is formed. The selection of protecting groups is, in part, dictated by particular coupling conditions, in part by the amino acid and peptide components involved in the reaction. Amino protecting groups ordinarily employed include those which are well known in the art, for example, urethane protecting substituents such as benzyloxy carbonyl carbobenzoxy , p methoxycarbobenzoxy, p nitrocarbobenzoxy, t butyoxycarbonyl, and the like. It is preferred to utilize t butyloxycarbonyl BOC for protecting the amino group in the amino acids undergoing reaction at the carboxyl end of said amino acid. The BOC protecting group is readily removed following such coupling reaction and prior to the subsequent step by the relatively mild action of acids i.e. trifluoroacetic acid, or hydrogen chloride in ethyl acetate . The OH group of Thr and Ser can be protected by the Bzl group and the amino group of Lys can be protected by the INOC group or the 2 chlorobenzyloxycarbonyl 2 C1 CBZ group. Neither group is affected by TFA, used for removing BOC protecting groups. After the peptide is formed, the protective groups, such as 2 C1 CBZ and Bzl, can be removed by treatment with HF or by catalytic hydrogenation. After the peptide has been formed on the solid phase resin, it may be removed from the resin by a variety of methods which are well known in the art. For example the peptide may be cleaved from the resin with hydrazine, by ammonia in methanol, or by methanol plus a suitable base. Preparation of the novel inhibitory peptides of the present invention utilizing the solid phase technique is illustrated in the following examples.These examples nave actually been carried out.However, they are not intended to be any limitation of the present invention. EXAMPLE 1N Isobutyryl L histidyl L prolyl L phenylalanyl L histidyl 3S,4S statyl L leucyl benzylamide The title peptde was prepared by standard solid phase methodology, as described in Erickson andMerrifield, Proteins, 3rd et., 2 257 527, 1976, using a Beckman Model 990B peptide synthesizer to carry out the operations according to the attached programs.A. Isobutyryl L histidyl L prolyl L phenylalanyl L histidyl 35, 4S statyl L leucyl O Resin The starting polymer was BOC Leu esterified to 2 cross linked polystyrene divinylbenzene 6 ol, 5.00 g . The N BOC derivatives of Sta,His DNP, Phe, and Pro were coupled using dicyclohexylcarbodiimide with an equivalent of the additive l hydroxybenzotriazole hydrate. The Sta was prepared in accordance with Rich et al., J. Org. Chem.43 3624, 1978. The BOC group was removed with 408 trifluoroacetic acid. A coupling of 60 minutes followed by a recoupling of 120 minutes 2.5 equivalents each time of BOC amino acid were used for each amino acid, except for Sta. These coupling times had been previously demonstrated to give complete coupling as judged by the method of Kaiser in this sequence. In order to conserve the amounts of Sta employed, an initial coupling using 1.08 equivalents of N alpha BOC Sta in 20 ml of 1 1 CE2C12 DMF for 72 hrs gave approximately 95 complete reaction. The addition of an additional 0.12 equivalents of N BOC Sta plus an equal amount of DCCI to the stirring suspension gave complete coupling after an additional 18 hrs.The N terminal isobutyryl group was coupled for 60 minutes as the symmetrical anhydride generated in situ from 5.0 equivalents of isobutyric.acid and 2.5 equivalents ofDCCI. This was followed by a recoupling for 120 minutes using 2.5 equivalents of isobutyric acid,HBT, and DCCI. The DNP protecting groups on His were removed in the final program using two 25 minute treatments with 10 thiophenol in DMF. The finished resin peptide 2.70 g was dried and suspended in 40 ml of dry methanol.

Thus, 0.10 g of the hydrazide 0.10 mmol was dissolved in 0.5 ml of dry, degassed dimethylformamide, and cooled to 300C under a nitrogen atmosphere. To this cold solution was added 1.lmmol of fresh 7.1 N hydrochloric acid in dry tetrahydrofuran. To this acidic solution was then added 15V1 of isoamylnitrite over a period of 10 minutes.

EXAMPLE 28Human Renin Inhibition An assay was carried out in order to determine the inhibitory potency of the peptides of the present invention. The assay measured the inhibition of human kidney renin purified as described in Bangham, D. R., Robertson, I., Robinson,J. I. S., Robinson, C. J., and Tree, M., ClinicalScience and Molecular Medicine, 48 Supp. 2 136s 159s 1975 , and further purified by affinity chromatography on pepstatin aminohexyT Sepharase as described in Poe, M., Wu., J. K., Florance, J. R.,Radkey, J. A., Bennett, C. D., and Hoagsteen, K., J. Biol. Chem. li82, in press . The assay was also in accordance with Poe et al. cited above. Results are expressed as KI values, which refer to the dissociation constant of the inhibited enzyme inhibitor complex. This K1 value was obtained as described above. Pepstatin was used as an active control. The results are set out in the table below.
