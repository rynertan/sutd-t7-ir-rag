# Apparatus for treating specimens at low temperature.

## Abstract
Apparatus for treating biological specimens at low temperatures for subsequent microscopic examination com prises a container having a specimen treatment chamber 20 disposed in a vessel 3 adapted to contain liquid coolant 2 . The specimen treatment chamber 20 is adapted to receive a specimen to be treated 5 and a specimen treatment medium 6 . Precooling means is provided for precooling the specimen treatment medium 6 before it is introduced to the specimen treatment chamber 20 . The precooling means comprises a reservoir 27 communicating with the specimen treatment chamber 20 , and delivery means 25b for delivering the specimen treatment medium 6 to the reser voir 27 . The reservoir 27 and delivery means 25b are arranged so that specimen treatment medium flowing through the reservoir 27 and delivery means 25b is cooled by the liquid coolant, and so that the specimen treatment medium 6 can flow through the delivery means in counter current heat exchange with specimen treatment medium 6 flowing from the reservoir 27 to the specimen treatment chamber 20 .
