## Description
TITLEPREPARATION OF alpha CHLORO ORTHO XYLENE This invention relates to a process for the preparation of a chloro ortho xylene. It has been reported Olah et al, J.Org.Chem., 39, pp.3472 8, 1974 that the ratio of side chain to ring chlorination in ortho xylene and a number of other arylalkanes, using PCl5 or PCl3 and chlorine in the dark, is high, with the implication that the phosphorus chlorides are effective catalysts for side chain chlorination in the absence of light or free radicals.Although the conclusions of Olah have been criticised by Messina et al J.Org.Chem., 44, 2270 4, 1979 who worked with ethylbenzene, the present inventors have repeated the work of Olah and find that side chain selectivity is indeed exi.ibited, in the dark and in the absence of free radical initiators, up to conversion levels of about 15 but that, above this level, ring substitution predominates with the result thatOlah s conditions are not suitable for the commercial production of a chloro ortho xylen e. According to the present invention there is provided a process for the preparation of a chloro orthoxylene which comprises reacting ortho xUlene with chlorine in the presence of a phosphorus halide and a free radical initiator at from 10 C to 800C. The ortho xylene may be used neat or dissolved in an inert solvent, such as carbon tetrachloride or chlorobenzene, and the chlorine is preferably added in the gaseous state at atmospheric or higher pressures. The phosphorus halide is preferably phosphorus trichloride or phosphorus pentachloride and especially the latter. The free radical initiator preferably has a half life, at 500C, of at least 20 hours and as suitable initiators there may be mentioned azo compounds such as azobisisobutyronitrile and peroxides such as dodecanoyl peroxide and benzoyl peroxide. Although the rate of reaction is to some extent dependent on the concentrations of the phosphorus halide and the free radical initiator, these are only required in catalytic proportions, preferred quantities being from 0.01 to 1coo, and especially preferred quantities being from 0.1 to 2.5 , by weight1 based on the weight of ortho xylene.If necessary, further additions of the initiator may be made during the reaction period in order to maintain this within the desired range. Although the reaction may be performed at a temperature from 1000 to 800C it is preferably performed at a temperature from 3500 to 55 C and more preferably from 400C to 500C because with the preferred free radical initiators the rate of reaction is rather slow at the lower temperatures and the increased rate of dichlorination reduces the yield of the mono chlorinated product at the higher temperatures. The rate of reaction may also be varied by adjustment of the rate of addition of chlorine or by a combination of this and the aforementioned rate determining factors. For commercial efficiency it is preferred to continue the process until the percentage conversion of ortho xylene into chlorinated products is in he range 20 to 80 and more preferably in the range 3W,ó to 70 . At higher percentage conversions the formation of higher chlorinated xylenes becomes prevalent and efficiency falls off. The process nay be carried out in a batchwise manner but is conveniently performed in a continuous manner and particularly by mcans of a loop reactor in which the heat of reaction is to some extent dissipated by the recirculating reaction medium. The desired product may be conveniently separated from unchanged reactants and unwanted by products by one or more distillation operations. The process is further illustrated by the following Examples in which the parts and percentages are by weight, unless otherwise indicated. Example 1 134 Parts of dry chlorine gas are passed into a 1 litre glass reactor containing a well stirred mixture of 500 parts of dry o xylene, 2.5 parts of phosphorus pentachloride and 2.5 parts of azobisicobutyronitrile in the dark during 1µ hours, and the temperature maintained at 45iC by external cooling.After reaction the solution is degassed with nitrogen and distilled through a Vigreux column initially at 20 mm mercury pressure to give 333.5 parts of unchanged o xylene b.p. 34 36iC 66.7 recovery and then at 2 mm pressure to give 184 parts of a chloro o xylene, b.p. 48 52 C 84 theory yield based on o xylene consumed . The 25 parts of residue remaining after distillation contain mainly ca dichloro oxylene. Example 2 The procedure of Example 1 is repeated except that the quantity of chlorine is increased to 240 parts and that the 2.5 parts of azobisisobutyronitrile is replaced by 6.2 parts of dodecanoyl peroxide. The reaction mixture is worked up as before to give 202 parts of unchanged o xylene, b.p. 34 36eC 20 mm Hg 40.4 recovery and 317 parts of a chloro o xylene, b.p. 48 50 C 2 mm Hg 8o theory yield based on o xylene consumed . Example 3 The procedure of Example 1 is repeated except that 550 parts of chlorine are passed into the reaction mixture during 29 hours at 45 0,a second 2.5 part aliquot of azobisisobutyronitrile is added after 45 minutes reaction and a third 2.5 part aliquot after 19 hours.After 2µ hours reaction almost all of the o xylene charged has been consumed and the mixture is distilled to give 296 parts of a chloro o xylene, b.p. 48 52iC 2 mm Hg 45 theory . After distillation the remaining 415 parts of residue consists almost entirely of aa dichloro o xylene. ttam le 4 The procedure of Example 1 is repeated except that the quantity of chlorine is increased to 300 parts, the quantity of ortho xylene is increased to 1000 parts, the quar.tity of phosphorus pentachloride and azobisbutyronitrile are both increased to 5 parts and the temperature is maintained at 43 t 200 throughout the 25 minute reaction period. After distillation under the conditions set out in Example 1 the xylene recovered amounts to 615 parts 61.5s recovery and the yield of a chloro ortho xylene is 469 parts 91.8S theory based on xylene consumption .The distillation residue amounts to 47 parts.Example 5 The procedure of Example 4 is repeated except that the amount of chlorine is increased to 370 parts and this is added over a period of 40 minutes.

Example 6 The procedure of Example 4 is repeated except that the amount of chlorine is increased to 330 parts and this is added over a period of 35 minutes. After the initial distillation according to Example 1, i.e.at 20 mm Hg, the xylene recovered amounts to 515 parts 51.5 recovery . The residue of 645 parts contains 605 parts of a chloro ortho xylene yield 95.4 theory based on xylene consumption . This product may be converted directly into ortho benzyl toluen e, without separation from the small quantity of higher chlorinated products, according to the process described in UKPatent Application No.2009224A.Example 7 The procedure of Example 1 is repeated except that 1143 parts of chlorine are passed into a 5 litre glass reactor containing 4000 parts of xylene, 30 parts of PC15 and 30 parts of dodecanoyl peroxide, the latter in place of the 2.5 parts of azobisbutyronitrile, over a period of 90 minutes while the temperature is maintained at 43 t 2 C. After distillation under the conditions set out in Example 1 the xylene recovered amounts to 2560 parts 64 recovery and the yield of a chloro ortho xtlene is 1622 parts 85 theory based on xylene consumption .

The chlorine efficiency is 94.8 .
