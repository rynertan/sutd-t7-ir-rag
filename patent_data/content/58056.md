## Description
Apparatus for and Method of Continual RemoteMonitoring of local Condition of a Liquid in aMachine Part This invention relates to apparatus for and a method of continual remote monitoring of a local condition, such as the temperature, the pressure, or the volume, of a liquid in a machine in operation and which includes one or more parts wherein liquid is contained and fulfils a function the success of which is contingent upon a variable quantity in a range departure from which is susceptible of interfering with, or at least impairing to a greater or lesser degree, the operation of the machine. The invention is applicable, for example, to the continual monitoring of the oil level in the tank of mining machinery in operation. It is presently known to monitor such machinery oil levels by mechanical means, which is difficult to do, and by electrical means, which of course must be either flameproof or intrinsically safe. Thus both known forms of monitoring have disadvantages. An object of the present invention is to obviate or mitigate these disadvantages. In accordance with the present invention, a method of continual remote monitoring of a local condition of a liquid as aforesaid comprises transmitting light by means of optical fibres from a source to light responsive indicating means along a trajectory passing through the liquid container, and mounting in the container an opaque plate the position or attitude of which changes as the quantity to be monitored of the liquid varies such that a warning indication is given when said liquid quantity departs from said range. Preferably, the light is split into a plurality of beams passing through the container such that the plate affects each beam in succession as said liquid quantity varies. Also, in accordance with the present invention apparatus for continual remote monotoring of a local condition of a liquid as aforesaid comprises a light source, a light responsive indicating means including a warning indicator, optical fibres transmitting light from the source to the indicating means along a trajectory passing through the liquid container,and an opaque plate mounted in the container in such manner that its position or attitude can change in response to variation of the quantity to be monitored of the liquid and the warning indicator is activated when said livid quantity departs from said range. Preferably, the optical fibres produce within the container a plurality of light beams which are successively affected by said plate as the liquid quantity varies. Preferably also, the optical fibres are contained in a bundle outside the container1 said fibres being divided into separate optical paths on each side of the plate within the container. Preferably also, the plate and the divided optical paths are contained in a closed casing located within the liquid container. Embodiments of the present invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig 1 is a diagrammatic view of apparatus for the continual remote monitoring of a local condition of a liquid as aforesaid Fig. 2 is a diagrammatic view of apparatus for monitoring the liquid level in a container Fig. 3 is an elevation of a casing within the container and mounting a plate for pivotal movement Fig 4 is a plan view of the casing Fig 5 is a sectional end elevation of the casing Fig. 6 illustrates an optical fibre source and receiver, a connection into the liquid container and the plate casing and Fig. 7 is a sectional side view of the casing. Fig. 1 is a generic illustration of apparatus in accordance with the invention. The liquid whereof a variable quantity is to be monitored is contained in a container not shown remote from which are a switchbox 10 and an indicator panel 11 so disposed that light beams collected from an emitter 12 in the switchbox 10 by the individual fibres of a bundle of six optical fibres 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18 pass into the container whence five of the light beams may selectively continue on to the indicator panel 11 and the sixth 18 returns to the switchbox 10 by way of a seventh optical fibre 19. Within the container, at an upper level therein, is. mounted a closed casing 20 of rectangular box shape.The six optical fibres 13 to 18 pass into the casing through a coupling 21 at the top and towards one side of the casing 20, and the five optical fibres 13 to 17 leave the casing through a coupling 22 at the top and towards the opposite side of the casing 20. The fibres 13 to 17 extend to different depths in the casing and have horizontal stretches which are in a vertically spaced series and are divided. to provide a parallel sided gap 23. The fibre 18 has a horizontal stretch spaced above the others and which terminates at the entry side of the gap 23 to be continued at the other side of the gap by a short horizontal stretch of the seventh optical fibre l9 which has an upward return bend to a straight stretch extending across the gap 23 and closing same off from above prior to leaving the casing 20 through the coupling 21.The bundle of optical fibres 13 to 18 is contained in flexible armouring 24 between the coupling 21 and a coupling 25 through which said fibres pass into the switchbox 10. Likewise the bundle of optical fibres 13 to 17 is contained in flexible armouring 26 between the coupling 22 and a coupling 27 through which said fibres pass to the indicating panel 11. The light beams travelling along the optical fibres 13 to 17 from the emitter 12, provided they are not intercepted in the casing 20, illuminate lamps at the indicating panel 11, the lamps then illuminated through the fibres 15, 16 and 17 displaying the colour green, that illuminated through the fibre 13 displaying the colour yellow, and that illuminated through the fibre 14 displaying the colour red. The colours green, yellow and red have the usual signification. The light beam travelling along the optical fibre 18, if not interrupted in the casing 20, crosses the gap and continues along the optical fibre 19 back to the switchbox 10 wherein the fibre 19 is turned away from the fibres 13 to 18 and focuses white light on a photo sensitive receiver 28 and maintains the supply for operation of the machine. Referring now to Figs. 2 to 7 of the drawings, a liquid container, one wall of which is shownat 30 inFig. 2 has mounted therein a casing 31 into and from which extend a bundle 32 of five optical fibres 33 to 37 which passes through the container wall 30 from and to an external source receiver 38 remote from the container. At each passage through the container wall 30 the bundle 32 of five optical fibres extends into and from a coupling 39 enabling the stretches of fibres external of the casing to be connected or disconnected. In practice, as illustrated in Fig. 6, the bundle 32 of optical fibres is sheathed in flexible armouring 50. Within the casing 31, the bundle 32 of five optical fibres is separated into its constituent fibres 33 to 37 which have equi spaced straight stretches inter mediate which they are divided to provide a parallelsided gap 40 through which an opaque plate 41 can swing. The plate 41 is mounted on a spindle 42 which extends out of the casing 31 through a sealing gland and is connected to an arm 43 which carries a float 44.Thus, as the liquid level in the container falls the plate pivots upwards and successively interrupts the light beam trajectories across the gap along the individual optical fibres 33 to 37. In this embodiment, the four light beams to be first interrupted as the plate 41 pivots upwards individually display the colour green at the receiver so that the level of liquid in the tank can be ascertained from the number of green lamps illuminated. As the liquid level dimishes the float is lowered, the plate pivots and successively interrupts the light beam trajectories along the individual optical fibres, and, at each such interruption, the pertaining signal lamp at the receiver is extinguished. When the level of the liquid in the container reaches a critical low, the plate 41 clears the gap where it divides the fifth optical fibre and the light beam resulting displays a red warning lamp. In the simplest form provision is made for illumination of only one green lamp and the red lamp. The apparatus hereinbefore described with reference to Figs. 2 to 7 is designed for use in the mining industry and provides safe and easily operated means for monitoring the level of oil in a tank from a location remote from the machinery of which the tank forms part. Due to the coupling in the tank wall, the external optical fibre bunches can be disconnected when not required. The casing within which the plate and divided optical fibre paths are located is normally a fixture.in the tank though it can be removed as required.
