# Process for improving the strength of a wire.

## Abstract
Process for improving the strength characteristics of a wire 1 composed of an austenitic metal alloy having an Md temperature of no higher than about 100 C and an Ms temperature of no higher than about minus 100 C, com prising the steps of a deforming the wire 1 at a strain of at least about 10 percent and at a temperature of between about Md minus 50 C and Md plus 50 C, so that the wire 1 has a mar tensite phase of no greater than about 10 percent by volume and an austenite phase of at least about 90 percent by volume and a yield strength of between about 130,000 and 230,000 psi b cooling the wire 1 to a temperature no higher than about minus 75 C and c drawing the cooled wire 1 so that the wire has a martensite phase of at least about 50 percent by volume and an austenite phase of at least about 10 percent by volume. The drawing of step c is carried out by drawing the wire 1 through two dies 5, 6 placed in series so that the cross sectional area of the wire 1 is reduced by the first die 5 by a percentage between about 8 and 15 per cent and the cross sectional area of the reduced wire is further reduced by the second die 6 by a percentage in between about 8 and 15 percent based on the area of the wire exiting the first die 5 .
