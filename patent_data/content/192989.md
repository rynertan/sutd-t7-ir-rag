# Integrated circuit with a semiconductor capacitor and process for its production.

## Abstract
A semiconductor integrated circuit comprising a capaci tor device including a first conductive layer on a semiconduc tor substrate, an insulating layer on the first conductive layer and a second conductive layer of polysilicon on the insulat ing layer, an outer insulating layer covering the second conductive layer and formed with a plurality of openings each of which extends to the surface of the second conduc tive layer, and a metal layer formed on the outer insulating layer, the metal layer having portions contacting the second conductive layer respectively through the openings in the outer insulating layer.
