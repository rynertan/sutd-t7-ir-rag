# Dot matrix printer.

## Abstract
A dot matrix printer can register dot character patterns input through an external unit 11 . It has a circuit 17 for correcting a dot character pattern. This circuit 17 checks a dot character pattern stored in a buffer memory 13 to determined whether any two adjacent dots of the pattern which are arranged in the printing direction contact or not. If the dots contact, one of them is erased, thus correcting the dot character pattern. The corrected dot character pattern is stored in a character generator 18 . The corrected pattern is supplied from the character generator 18 to a drive circuit 20 . The drive circuit 20 drives a print head, etc., whereby the dot character corresponding to the pattern read from the character generator is printed.
