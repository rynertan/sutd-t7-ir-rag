## Description
The present invention relates generally to photovoltaic devices and, in a particular example, to a monolithic thin film solar cell in which a plurality of photovoltaic regions are connected in series. In the past, arrays of thin film solar cells have been fabricated by depositing each layer of the cells, including the photoactive layers, in preselected patterns. Alternatively, the layers have been patterned after deposition by removing portions of the layers between cells. The resulting cells are connected together externally to form solar arrays. Examples of arrays constructed in this manner are described in Hanak Monolithic Solar Cell Panel of Amorphous Silicon , Another form of thin film photovoltaic device is described in Kuwano et al. U.S. Patent No. 4,281,208, wherein one of the disclosed embodiments has an unpatterned active layer containing a number of photovoltaic regions. Electrical interconnection is made beyond the edge of the active layer. The structure is easier to manufacture than those described above, but is limited in size by the sheet resistance of its electrodes because current must be conducted to the ends of the cells where interconnection is made. The sheet resistance can severely attenuate any portion of the output signal generated at the interior of the panel, making the disclosed structure impractical for most uses. The Kuwano et al. patent also discloses another arrangement in which the active layer is patterned to permit connection at the interior of the panel. Therefore, it is desirable in many applications to provide a thin film photovoltaic device wherein the active layer is continuous and unpatterned, yet the photovoltaic regions of the film can be easily connected in series. The present invention relates more particularly to a photovoltaic device comprising a continuous photovoltaic thin film having front and back major surfaces and a plurality of spaced photovoltaic regions transparent electrode means at the front surface having a plurality of discrete front electrode portions formed prior to formation of the continuous photovoltaic thin film and substantially coextensive with the respective photovoltaic regions back electrode means at the back surface having a plurality of discrete back electrode portions substantially coextensive with the respective photovoltaic regions each front electrode portion overlapping the back electrode portion of an adjacent photovoltaic region at a preselected area for electrical connection to be established with said back electrode portion through the continuous photovoltaic thin film. Such a photovoltaic device is described in US A 4 428 110 and GB A 2 095 908. It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved photovoltaic device and method of manufacure. Accordingly, the present invention as claimed characterised in that each front electrode portion includes at east one contact portion which is substantially thicker than said photovoltaic thin film and through which said electrical connection is established. The method of manufacturing a photovoltaic device according to the present invention is recited in claim 10. The device of the present invention is monolithic having a plurality of cells defined by spaced photovoltaic regions of a continuous active layer. Because the cells are connected transversely through the active layer itself, connection can be accomplished at any desired location without patterning the layer. A principal limitation on the manufacturing feasibility, size and shape of monolithic solar panels is therefore eliminated. Additionally, the back electrode can be deposited directly onto the deposited semiconductor surface without removing it from the processing unit for patterning. This relaxes concerns relating to contamination of the semiconductor surface before the back contact is applied. The concept of the present invention is most useful in the case of thin film devices, such as microcrystalline thin film MTF photovoltaic devices, although it may also be useful in devices having polycrystalline or single crystal thin films. In this context, the term microcrystalline is intended to cover films loosely defined as amorphous in the literature. Most of such films contain microcrystalline areas, whether intentionally or unintentionally produced. Thus, it is considered more accurate to refer to all films lacking microscopic crystallinity as being generally microcrystalline . Overlapping electrodes enable connection to be made between the back of one cell and the front of an adjacent cell to connect the cells electrically in series. Contact portions or stitch bars of the front electrodes may have an irregular surface near the thin film active layer and are much thicker than the layer, and the active layer is applied over them. The electrical standoff of the active layer is therefore very small near the stitch bars, resulting in a number of localized conductive paths or short circuits extending through the layer. Conduction can be improved even further by heating the back electrodes, either uniformly or selectively, to diffuse the electrode or other conductivity inducing material into the active layer. In each of these configurations, the flow of current through the active layer is substantially limited to a transverse flow across the thickness of the layer from one electrode portion to another. There is no appreciable current flow within the plane of the active layer because the layer has a very high sheet resistivity. Thus the cells act as discrete solar cells connected electrically in series to achieve a suitably high output voltage level. If the stitch bar of the front electrode is not tall enough or irregular enough to short through the active layer on its own, electrical connection can be achieved by localized heating of the back electrode portions in the areas of electrode overlap. The electrode material then diffuses into the film to produce a localized region of higher conducivity. This permits current to travel transversely through the active layer, as described above, but not in the plane of the active layer. Localized heating can be achieved by use of a laser, electron beam gun or other suitable means. A laser is particularly useful in producing highly localized conductive regions which do not unduly limit the active area of the cells. In some applications it may also be desirable to apply a thin strip of a conductivity inducing agent, such as phosphorous, boron or arsenic, to the interconnect region. The agent can diffuse into the active layer on its own or in the presence of applied heat to create a conductive interconnect. The agent might, for example, be applied by a screen printing process, or by heating localized areas with a laser beam in a gaseous environment containing a suitable dopant gas. Any of these configurations permit the area of overlap and separation of the electrode portions to be minimized, yielding a highly efficient solar panel. The above and other features of the present invention may be more fully understood from the following detailed description, taken together with the accompanying drawings, wherein similar reference characters refer to similar elements throughout and in which Fig. 1 shows a monolithic thin film solar panel 10 constructed according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The panel defines a plurality of elongated solar cells 12 connected electrically in series between a pair of external leads 14. The cells are shaped as narrow strips connected along opposite longitudinal edges to minimize series resistance losses. Connection between cells is accomplished directly through an unpatterned active film of the solar panel, without interrupting the film. Current generated by the cells in response to incident light hv travels a very short distance within each cell electrode before passing to the opposite electrode of an adjacent cell. As seen in Fig. 2, the solar panel 10 comprises a transparent substrate 16, a transparent front electrode 18, a continuous thin film 20 of photovoltaic material and a patterned back electrode 22. The electrode 22 comprises a plurality of back electrode portions 24 separated by a spacing 26 and arranged to substantially overlie elongated photovoltaic regions 28 of the thin film. The front electrode 18 includes a transparent conductive layer 29 and a series of contact portions or stitch bars 30. The layer 29 is patterned to form a plurality of transparent electrode portions 32 separated by a spacing 34 and substantially underlying the respective photovoltaic regions. The photovoltaic regions are thus effectively sandwiched between the back electrode portions 24 and the front electrode portions 32 for collection of current generated within the regions. In addition, each front electrode portion partially overlaps the back electrode portion of an adjacent photovoltaic region over a preselected area 36. A major feature of the present invention is the provision of conductive paths substantially transversely through the active thin film 20 between each front electrode portion and the back electrode portion of an adjacent photovoltaic region. Interconnection is accomplished at the area of electrode overlap to connect the photovoltaic regions electrically in series without patterning or otherwise interrupting the film. In the embodiment 10, the stitch bars 30 are tall and narrow enough, and or irregular enough, in comparison to the thin film 20, to electrically short through the film. Although the stitch bars are shown as being applied over the transparent layer 29, it is also possible to apply them directly to the surface of the substrate 16 as long as the subsequently applied transparent layer is in electrical contact with them. The final configuration of the solar panel 10 is illustrated best in Fig. 3, wherein the stitch bars cause the subsequently applied film 20 to be distorted in a manner producing relatively thin regions 38 which are unable to withstand the cell voltage. Electrical conduction takes place through the regions 38. It is advantageous that the stitch bars be as rough as possible at their upper surfaces to focus the applied electric field and minimize the resistance of the regions 38. The stitch bars 30 are preferably approximately 25 µm thick, and the thin film 20 and the patterned transparent conductive layer 29 are approximately 600 and 200 nm 6,000 and 2,000 angstroms thick, respectively. The thickness of the back electrode may be approximately 25 µm, if screen printed, or approximately 2 µm, if evaporated. At the locations of the stitch bars 30 in one embodiment, the film 20 is sandwiched between a pair of conductive elements at least 40 times thicker than the thickest portion of the film. The thickness ratio is even greater at the relatively thin regions 38, where the thickness of the film may be as small as 0.5nm 5 angstroms or less. This produces an effective short circuit through the film in the area of each stitch bar, but does not short out the cells 12 because the film 20 has a very high sheet resistance. The sheet resistance virtually eliminates current within the plane of the film, leaving only substantially transverse currents developed within the photovoltaic regions and passed between the electrodes at the areas of overlap. Referring to Figs. 2 and 3 in more detail, the various layers and electrode portions of the panel 10 are sequentially deposited on a major surface 40 of the substrate 16. The substrate is preferably made of glass or other suitable transparent material which is compatible with the materials of the stitch bars 30 and the transparent conductive layer 29. The transparent conductive layer 29 is preferably a transparent conductive oxide TCO , such as indium tin oxide ITO , tin oxide TO or indium oxide IO . A combination of layers of these materials can be used to effect chemical and or electronic compatibility, and optimize device performance. In order to minimize contamination, it is preferable to deposit the transparent conductive layer prior to application of the stitch bars. However, the order of application can be reversed if suitable precautions are taken. The transparent conductive layer 29 is preferably deposited, in the first instance, as a continuous layer. ITO, for example, may be deposited at approximately 300 degrees Celsius by vacuum evaporation of indium and tin in an oxygen atmosphere with glow discharge assistance. The glow discharge activates the oxygen to produce a high quality film. TO can be deposited using a chemical vapor process and IO is preferably deposited by reactive evaporation of indium in an activated oxygen atmosphere. The thickness of the transparent conductive layer 29 is selected to minimize reflection and absorption of light by it. According to established optical principles, internal reflection losses from a transparent coating are minimized when the thickness of the coating is an odd multiple of quarter wavelengths of incident light, divided by the index of refraction of the coating. For present purposes, the relevant wavelength is that at the peak of the spectral response of the photovoltaic material making up the film 20. In the case of MTF silicon, it is approximately 540 nm 5,400 angstroms , corrected to 300 nm 3,000 angstroms for an index of refraction of 1.8 one quarter wavelength is 75 nm 750 angstroms and three quarters of a wavelength is 225 nm 2,250 angstroms . Although many conventional transparent conductive oxides require the larger thickness to reduce sheet resistivity to an acceptable level, the 75 nm 750 angstrom thickness is desirable, if practical, to minimize absorption. The stitch bars are preferably applied over the transparent conductive layer, either by screen printing or evaporation through a mask. In the case of screen printing, a suitable commercially available screen printing paste is forced onto the surface through a patterned screen. The paste may contain, for example, silver Ag powder, glass frit and a suitable organic vehicle or binder. After application to the transparent layer, the paste is fired to drive off the organic vehicle and leave the silver and glass frit behind. The glass frit is intended to fuse to the substrate, providing a strong bond, while silver metal makes the stitch bars conductive. Alternatively, a commercial screen printing paste without glass frit can be used. If the stitch bars are evaporated, they may be made of silver, aluminum or other material providing a high quality contact. Although the stitch bars 30 are illustrated as grid lines or sections of grid lines passing through the preselected areas 36 of electrode overlap, it is not necessary that they be continuous or that they be lines at all. If the stitch bars are screen printed, they should be approximately 25 µm in height to operate satisfactorily. If evaporated, they should be about 2 µm, and preferably 10 µm, in height. In each case, the aspect ratio height divided by width and the roughness or surface irregularity of the stitch bars are the parameters responsible for the localized short circuit that permits the panel 10 to operate. If the width of the bars is substantial in relation to their height, or the bars are smooth rather than rough, it may be necessary to increase their height beyond the values set out above. Roughness is usually the dominant factor giving rise to the highly conductive pathways. It permits the stitch bars to act as a series of point sources of electrical potential, significantly enhancing conduction through the active layer. In some circumstances, the surface irregularity or microroughness resulting from the process of depositing the stitch bars can serve this purpose. After application of the stitch bars, the transparent conductive layer 29 is patterned using conventional techniques, such as laser scribing. In the case of the panel 10, the patterning operation entails removal of the transparent conductive layer along a series of parallel lines near the stitch bars 30, yielding the front electrode portions 32 separated by spacings 34. The front electrode portions are then shaped as parallel strips corresponding generally in area to the cells 12 of Fig. 1. However, the front electrode portions 32 and the cells 12 need not be shaped as strips, as long as each front electrode portion is provided with an interconnecting portion 42 which overlaps part of the back electrode portion of an adjacent photovoltaic region. Although the layer 29 can be applied either before or after the stitch bars 30, it is preferably not patterned until after the stitch bars have been applied. The stitch bars 30 then act as a guide for patterning the layer 29. The thin film 20 may contain any suitable photovoltaic material defining a photojunction for conversion of light to electrical energy. In the preferred embodiment, the film 20 is MTF silicon having N , I and P layers 44, 46 and 48, respectively, as illustrated in Fig. 2. Alternatively, it may be a polycrystalline, or even single crystalline, material. In the case of MTF silicon, the film 20 is deposited by conventional glow discharge techniques without patterning or masking. The film 20 extends continuously and completely across the stitch bars 30, the transparent conductive layer 29 and the spacings 34. The thickness of the film 20, complete with all three layers of different conductivity types, is approximately 600 nm 6000 angstroms . Although this dimension depends upon the material of the film 20, the stitch bars 30 must, in any case, be tall and rough, as compared to the thickness of the thin film. Otherwise, the desired conductive paths through the film will not exist. The back electrode 22 serves as the back contact of the cells 12. It can be formed by any suitable technique, such as screen printing. In the case of screen printing, a conventional epoxy based silver graphite material may be used to selectively apply conductive silver in the shape of the back electrode portions 24. The panel is then heated to approximately 100 degrees Celsius to cure the epoxy. Other metals, such as nickel, palladium or gold, can be substituted for silver in the back contact. In a commercial context, it is anticipated that the precious metals will be eliminated to minimize cost. A further possibility for the back electrode 22 is a molybdenum aluminum molybdenum sandwich layer wherein the three materials are applied sequentially by conventional techniques. The aluminum layer provides good reflectivity for redirecting light back into the thin film, while the outer molybdenum layers ensure good electrical contact with the thin film and good laser coupling. Laser coupling is important in the embodiment described below. Although shorting through the film 20 can be achieved in many circumstances with the structure described above, it is sometimes desirable to enhance localized conduction through the thin film 20 by applying heat to the solar panel 10. In the case in which the stitch bars 30 are relatively high, narrow and rough, such heat can cause diffusion of the back electrode material, and possibly the material of the stitch bars 30, into the semiconductive film 20. The resulting diffused region is much more conductive than the bulk of the film and enhances interconnection of the cells. The conductive metallic materials may diffuse into the film as discrete atoms or exist as particulates occupying interstitial sites within the film. In the latter case, the conductive regions of the film comprise mixtures of metallic and semiconductive particles. When heat is applied to the panel 10 to promote electrical conduction, it is usually desirable to apply the heat only at localized areas within the preselected areas of overlap 36. Thus, the bulk of the thin film 20 is unaffected by the heat and does not experience diffusion of the metallic electrode material, while the desired level of diffusion is obtained at the area of overlap. This approach is illustrated at the right hand side of Fig. 3, wherein a laser beam 50 is directed onto the back electrode portion 24 to produce a conductive region 51 at the relatively thin region 38. The laser beam 50, which may be the output of a laser scriber, is moved laterally across the solar panel to heat the thin film along the pattern of the stitch bar 30. The heating operation causes diffusion of the metallic electrode material into the thin film 20 in the neighborhood of the region 38. The beam 50 may melt the back contact and the thin film materials to form a eutectic composition of the two at the region 51, or may simply heat the materials enough to enhance diffusion. When the back contact is aluminium and the thin film is MTF silicon, the two materials may combine to form a conductive silicide bridging the thickness of the thin film. Although the localized application of heat is described above with regard to the laser beam 50, it will be understood that a variety of other heating techniques can be used. Such techniques include bombardment by an electron beam source or use of radiant heating wires to produce diffusion. It is anticipated that the cells 12 will usually be between a few millimeters and approximately two centimeters in width. The sheet resistance of the thin film 20 is critical to prevent shorting of the cells from one location of interconnection to another. The film 20 of the present invention preferably has a resistivity greater than 10⁶ ohms per square under conditions of incident sunlight. If the film has a lower resistivity, some of the semiconductive material can be etched away adjacent to the lines of interconnection to prevent shorting. In addition, the following ranges of operative parameters are considered useful in the practice of the present invention In operation, the solar panels 10 are arranged to receive incident light hv , through the transparent substrate 16 and the front electrode 18. Light is absorbed by the photovoltaic material of the regions 28 and is transformed into an electrical current for collection by the front and back electrode portions of the cells. The voltage at the front electrode portion of one cell is applied to the back electrode portion of an adjacent cell by the shorted regions of the film 20, connecting the cells in series. The voltage across the leads 14 thus represents the sum of the voltages of the solar cells 12, producing a relatively high overall output voltage level for the panel 10. A MTF solar module has been made according to the present invention with good results. The module was fabricated on a substrate of 7059 glass 10 centimeters square, as an array of 18 parallel strip cells. The glass substrate was cleaned first using a detergent, then a NH₄OH H₂O₂ etch, followed by a water rinse. The glass was then covered with tin oxide TO deposited by chemical vapor deposition from a gas mixture containing tetramethyl tin, CF₃Br and O₂. The resulting conductive oxide layer 29 had a sheet resistivity of 5 ohms per square and a light transmission in the solar spectrum of about 80 percent. The conductive layer was printed with an array of 18 parallel stitch bars 30 using a silver paste sold by Thick Film Systems under the name Conductrox 3347 and the sample was fired at 550 degrees Celsius, leaving stitch bars approximately 200 µm wide. A laser was then used to scribe the TO along a line beside each stitch bar, forming groove like spaces 34 in the TO layer. The spaces are about 25 µm wide to isolate the cells from one another. An additional laser scribe at the periphery of the substrate isolates the cells from TO which may extend over the edge of the glass. The substrate was then rinsed in methanol and placed in an MTF deposition reactor to produce a The final layer of the module, the back contact 24 , was deposited by evaporation through a shadow mask to a thickness of approximately 2 µm. The mask created spaces 26 approximately 100 µm wide between portions of the back contact layer, yielding a total interconnect width of approximately 380 µm. The module was then etched in a CF₄ 4 O₂ glow discharge at 100 watts for one and one half minutes to eliminate shorting between cells caused by the conductive The module produced in this way displayed the following characteristics From the above, it can be seen that there has been provided a photovoltaic device and related method of formation wherein a plurality of cells of a monolithic thin film solar panel are connected in series through a continuous photoactive film of the panel. While certain specific embodiments of the present invention have been disclosed as typical, the invention is, of course, not limited to these particular forms, but rather is applicable broadly to all variations falling within the scope of the appended claims. For example, the cells 12 of the solar panel 10 may, if desired, be any of a large number of shapes other than the simple strip shape disclosed herein. The electrodes at each side of the cells will then be shaped similarly and will be interconnected in the manner described herein to connect at least two of the cells electrically in series.
