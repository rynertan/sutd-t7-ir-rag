## Description
The invention relates to thermosetting resin compositions, particularly moulding compounds, based on resole resin, thickener, glass fibre, filters, if desired condensation catalysts and further usual additives. Such resin compositions, which gradually thicken at room temperature, are known for instance from the US patent specification 4,075,155. The disadvantage of the thickeners described in this patent specification, such as Ca OH ₂, Mg OH ₂ and Ba OH ₂, is that they func tion as catalysts for further reactions of the resole resin. The phenolic condensation reaction continues to proceed so that the resin composition does not acquire viscosity stability. The MgO thickener often used in unsaturated polyesters has the same disadvantage. The object of the invention is to provide a thermosetting resin composition on the basis of resole resin, thickener, glass fibre, fillers, if desired condensation catalysts and further usual additives, which composition avoids the said disadvantages and is suitable for use as moulding compound. The thermosetting resin composition according to the invention is characterized in that the thickener used is a precondensate of resor cinol and formaldehyde. Such thermosetting resin compositions according to the inven tion are preferably used as moulding compounds, such as Sheet Moulding Compounds SMC , Bulk Moulding Compounds BMC or Dough Moulding Compounds DMC . Such processing techniques are known from, among other things, the lectures read during the 13th Offentliche Jahrestagung der Arbeits gemeinschaft Verstärkte Kunststoffen held from 5 till 7 October 1976. Said compounds can be processed also via injection moulding techniques. The amount of precondensate of resorcinol and formaldehyde that is used according to the invention is 2 20 wt in respect of the resole resin. Preferably this amount is between 5 and 15 wt . This amount in part depends on the viscosity of the resole resin, which is usually between 3000 and 15000 mPas. The resole resins are less suitable for being processed into moulding compound if the viscosity of the resins is higher or lower than these values. The resorcinol formaldehyde ratio in the precondensate is bet ween 4 1 and 1.2 1 and is preferably about 2 1. The fillers in the moulding compounds according to the inven tion comprise, for instance, marl, quartz powder, wood flour, coconut shell flour, Millicarb filler of the firm Plüss Staufer AG and talcum. Other additives are, for instance, release agents such as calcium stearate, zinc stearate and ACMOS release agents of the firm of Tietjen Co., . The condensation catalyst used may be alkali metal hydroxides and or carbonates. For thermosetting resin compositions according to the inven tion to be used as sheet moulding compound preference is given to the use of compositions consiting of For thermosetting resin composition according to the inven tion to be used as bulk moulding compound or as dough moulding compound preference is given to the use of composition consisting of The thermosetting resin composition may contain, in addition to the precondensate of resorcinol and formaldehyde, a filler which is substantially water binding only above 50 C. An example of such a water binding agent is gypsum anhydrite CaSO₄.OH₂0 . It has been found that the curing of the moulding compounds according to the invention under pressure can be substantially improved by it. The invention will be further elucidated by means of examples following hereinafter without, however, being limited thereto. 5980 g 90 phenol the rest being water are introduced into a reactor provided with a stirrer, thermometer, condenser and heating, resp. cooling coil. After addition of 201 g 50 NaOH solution the mixture is heated. At about 80 C the metering of 3819 g paraform is started. Owing to the exothermic reaction that occurs, the temperature shows a quick further rise and by cooling it is kept at 95 C. During the cooling the metering of the paraform is interrupted. After about 20 minutes all paraform has been added and the reaction is continued for 15 minutes more at 95 C. To the resin 200 g caprolactam is added, upon which the condensation is continued until the desired resin viscosity has been reached 8000 mPas . The resin is cooled down to room temperature. The resulting resole resin 1 is applied in moulding compounds according to the examples following hereinafter. Into a reactor as described in example 1 2990 g 90 phenol and 100.5 g 50 NaOH are introduced. 1909.5 g paraform is metered in the same manner as in example 1. After the metering of the paraform the con densation is continued at 95 C and the reaction proceeds as follows. The temperature of the resin is subsequently lowered to 80 C, upon which the condensation is continued until the resin has reached a viscosity of 10,000 mPas. The resulting resole resin II is applied in moulding compounds according to the examples following hereinafter. In a reactor provided with a stirrer, thermometer, condenser and heating, resp. cooling coil 100 grammes 30 formalin and 220 grammes resorcinol are heated to 95 C. The heat of reaction is carried off by cooling and this temperature is maintained for 10 minutes. The resin is subsequently cooled to room temperature. Thus a precondensate of resor cinol and formaldehyde is obtained which is applied in the following examples. 2500 g phenolic resin resole resin I from example 1 , 250 grammes precondensate of resorcinol and formaldehyde, 3000 grammes Millicarb, 100 grammes zinc stearate and 10 grammes 50 NaOH solution are mixed in a mixer to form a homogeneous compound. The compound is still more or less liquid comparable with cement mortar. On an SMC machine a thin layer of compound is spread with a doctor blade on a pre stretched polyethylene film. Subsequently, using a cutting device glass roving 30 wt glass fibre calculated on the weight of the compound is strewn on it, after which a second layer of compound, also applied to a polyethylene film, is applied on top. The resulting sandwich of compound, glass fibre and compound is further compacted with a number of pressure rolls and a pressure belt so that the glass fibres are moistened by the resin. At the end of the machine the sheet still packed in the polyethylene films is rolled up. After the thickening of the compound the polyethylene films can be pulled from the SMC. At this moment a non sticky flexible sheet plate has been obtained. Parts of this sheet are piled up and put in a hot mould in which they first flow out under heat and pressure until the mould is completely filled and subsequently cure to form the desired product. Moulding conditions are at 160 C pressure 100 kg cm² moulding period 3 minutes. The resulting objects are of good quality and show a smooth surface. 2000 g phenolic resin resole resin II from example 2 , 210 grammes precondensate of resorcinol and formaldehyde, 1500 grammes gypsum anhydrite product AB 20 of the firm of BAYER , 1000 g Millicarb 85 grammes zinc stearate, 40 g water, 1800 g glass fibres are mixed as in example 4 and processed to form flexible sheet.
