# Loom control system.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a loom control system operable to stop the loom in the presence of a yarn break age. This loom comprises a feeding device 1 having a yarn storage drum 2 for temporarily storing the yarn and a yarn store sensor 6 9, 20, 30 sensing the quantity of yarn stored on the drum of the feeding device for transmitting an elec tric sensor signal representing the quantity of yarn stored on the drum to the feeding device to control the operation of the feeding device and to thereby control the quantity of yarn stored on the drum. Prior art loom control systems required complicated, costly and unreliable sensors for detecting whether a yarn breakage has occured or not. The present invention improves this state of art by pro viding a loom control system of the above mentioned kind with a monitor means being electrically connected to the yarn store sensor for receiving the sensor signal, wherein said monitor means derives information on yarn breakage before and or after the feeding device from said sensor sig nal or its variation with respect to the time to generate a stop signal for the loom.
