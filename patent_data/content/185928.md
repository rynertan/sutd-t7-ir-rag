## Abstract
A motor driven truck comprising a front lifting stand 3 , first guide and journalling means including a longitudinal stand 8 stationary mounted on the chassis 1 , second guide and journalling means including a stand 9 movable along the stationary stand 8 , and an operator s cab 2 supported by the movable stand 9 and arranged to be placed in a desired position which is variable with respect to the stationary stand 8 and to the front lifting stand 3 as well, said first guide and journalling means including journalling elements 15 which are firmly connected to the movable stand 9 and guided by the stationary stand 8 . According to the invention the stationary stand 8 is diagonally arranged so that it encompasses an acute angle α with the centre line C₁ of the truck and so that it extends between a rear place at the centre line C₁ and a front place at a front corner of the truck near one side of the lifting stand 3 , whereby the movable stand 9 includes a horizontal stand member 14 located under the cab and a vertical stand member 13 rigidly connected to the horizontal stand member 14 and arranged close to the rear surface 23 of the cab 2 . Said journalling elements 15 are firmly mounted onto the under side of the horizontal stand member 14 . The second guide and journalling means includes journalling elements 26, 27 firmly connected to the cab 2 and guided by the vertical stand member 13 . Furthermore, first force transmitting means 22 is connected to the stationary stand 8 and to the horizontal stand member 14 for controlled stepless movement of the cap 2 and the movable stand 9 along the stationary stand 8 , whereas second force transmitting means 28 is connected to the rear surface 23 of cab 2 and to the movable stand 9 for controlled stepless movement of the cap 2 along the vertical stand member 13 .
