# A cold start fuel air mixture supply device, and an air fuel induction system for spark ignition internal combustion engines including a cold start system.

## Abstract
A combined accelerator pump 14 and cold start fuel air mixture supply device 15 has an automatic throttle valve 21 in a mixture supply passage 17, a fuel control valve 53 controlling flow of fuel drawn into the passage 17 through an inlet 52 upstream of the throttle valve 21, and an air valve 23 upstream of the fuel inlet 52. A primary spring 32 tends to seat the air valve 23. A light, secondary spring 36 urges a plunger 25 against the air valve 23 to augment the load of the primary spring 32 for a predetermined time interval after the engine begins to run under its own power. A valve in a pipe 34 opens automatically at the end of the predetermined time interval to apply engine inlet manifold depression to the end of the plunger 25 remote from the air valve 23 and thereby to separate the plunger 25 from the air valve 23 so that only the primary spring 32 acts on the air valve 23.
