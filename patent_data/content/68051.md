## Description
A HYDROPYROLYSIS PROCESS FOR UPGRADING HEAVY OILS AND SOLIDS INTO LIGHT LIQUID PRODUCTS This invention relates to a hydropyrolysis process and, more particularly, to a hydropyrolysis process under carefully selected and controlled conditions of temperature and pressure wherein heavy, high molecular weight feedstocks are cracked in the presence of hydrogen to yield lighter, lower molecular weight, liquid products. Thermal cracking was the primary process for production of gasoline from crude petroleum until the late 1930 s.Thermal cracking was employed to increase the yield of gasoline either by direct processing of heavy feeds, or indirectly, through the production of light olefins, which were then subjected to polymerization. Subsequently, it was gradually replaced by the more efficient catalytic cracking and reforming. Thermal processes of importance during and before the Second World War included cracking, visbreaking, coking, reforming, alkylation and polymerization. Thermal reforming processes were used to convert low quality gasoline and naphtha into high octane gasoline by various transformations, e.g. isomerization and dehydrogenation, while thermal alkylation was employed in the production of blending components for aviation fuel. Another important thermal process, used in England during the Second World War for the manufacture of aromatics and olefins, was theCatarole process.In this process, highly naphthenic feeds were cracked to mono and diolefins, which, through resynthesis at extended reaction time, gave monocyclic and polycyclic aromatic compounds. At present, thermal cracking processes represent a relatively minor part less than 10 of the modern refining capacity in the United States. Such processes are being used for upgrading of heavy liquids and for production of petrochemicals. In particular, visbreaking and coking are two important applications for the production of fuels from heavy oils. Visbreaking is a mild form of thermal cracking which reduces the viscosity of feedstocks, such as vacuum resids and heavy gas oils. The process yields mainly middle distillate fuel, accompanied by lower amounts of gasoline, making it a suitable process in case the gasoline demand is low compared to that for middle distillate. Coking processes are based on the principle of carbon rejection, i.e. increase in the hydrogen carbon ratio of distillable liquid products at the expense of partial carbonization of the starting material.Coking is applied for upgrading of feeds such as reduced crudes, vacuum resids, shale oils, tar sand liquids, coal tar, and gilsonite. When such heavy liquids are heated to 480 5650C there is extensive cracking of large molecules yielding free radicals, which are stabilized by abstraction of hydrogen from other molecules. Continuation of this hydrogen transfer process leads to a liquid product gas oil which is richer in hydrogen, and a solid product coke which is poorer in hydrogen, as compared to the feed. Another important thermal process is the steam cracking of C2 C4 paraffins, naphtha, and gas oil for the manufacture of C2 C4 olefins, which are important starting materials in the petrochemical industry. With decreasing petroleum resources, increased interest is being directed toward the production of synthetic crudes from coal, tar sands, and oil shale. These crudes, because of their high viscosity and high molecular weight, present unique production, handling and processing problems. Present processes for upgrading heavy crude liquids are based either on addition of hydrogen or rejection of carbon. The addition of hydrogen to these heavy materials has proven to be very expensive. Accordingly, carbon rejection coking is currently the most popular method for upgrading heavy crudes. The disadvantage of coking is that it converts a substantial portion 10 25 of the feed material to coke. In view of the foregoing, it would be a significant advancement in the art to provide a process which will either totally or at least partially eliminate coke formation while increasing the liquid yield from high molecular weight feedstocks. It would also be an advancement in the art to provide a non catalytic process for producing lower molecular weight, liquid hydrocarbons from higher molecular weight hydrocarbons in the presence of heavy metal contaminants. Such a process is disclosed and claimed herein. The present invention relates to a novel hydropyrolysis process for upgrading heavier, higher molecular weight feedstocks to lighter, lower molecular weight, liquid products. The process includes pyrolysis in the presence of hydrogen at an elevated, carefully controlled temperature within the range of about 4500C 6500C and a pressure within the range of about 120 psi to 2250 psi. Advantageously, the process proceeds in the absence of a catalyst and in the presence of heavy metal contaminants within the feedstock. It is, therefore, a primary object of this invention to provide improvements in the production of lower molecular weight, liquid products from higher molecular weight feedstocks. Another object of this invention is to provide improvements in the process for converting higher molecular weight feedstocks into lower molecular weight, liquid product. Another object of this invention is to provide a process for producing lower molecular weight, liquid products from higher molecular weight feedstock. Another object of this invention is to provide a process for producing lower molecular weight, liquid products from higher molecular weight feedstocks in the presence of heavy metal contaminants within the feedstock. Another object of this invention is to provide a process for the hydropyrolysis of higher molecular weight feedstocks to produce lower molecular weight, liquid products in the absence of a catalyst. These and other objects and features of the present invention will become more fully apparent from the following description and appended claims.Introductory Discussion Hydropyrolysis may be defined as thermal cracking under hydrogen pressure. Until the present, hydropyrolysis has been employed in industry to a lesser extent than conventional thermal cracking processes although two important areas of present application for hydropyrolysis are hydrodealkylation and hydrogasification. Hydrodealkylation is a process for production of unsubstituted arenes from alkylsubstituted arenes. This process is preferred to catalytic processes because of its simplicity, ease of operation for extended periods of time, higher selectivity, and lower investment and operation costs. The most important among hydrodealkylation processes is the manufacture of benzene from alkylbenzenes. Hydrogasification is the process by which different distillates usual b.p. range up to 3500C are thermally cracked in the presence of hydrogen to produce a gaseous product rich in methane. An important hydrogasification process is the British Gas Council s Gas Recycle Hydrogenation GRH Process. Previously, the GRH product was blended mainly with gas from a coal gasification plant, but presently it is used to enrich the gas from steam naphtha reformers using feeds having a boiling point higher than 350 C. Recently, interest in hydropyrolysis as a hydrocarbon conversion process has been indicated in the publicationHydrocarbon Processing, New Route to Ethylene Hydropyrolysis see Barre, Chalavekilian, and R. Dumon, ChemicalEngineering News November 1976, pages 176 178. This publication relates to the investigation of hydropyrolysis as a process for producing olefins from heavy, liquid hydrocarbons. The hydropyrolysis reaction is carried out under very drastic conditions 800 9000C, and pressures of up to about 300 psi , using a residence time of less than 0.1 seconds. A substantial increase in the yield of low olefins was obtained as compared to that in the conventional steam cracking process. Other processes have been developed to produce methane, benzene and ethane by the hydropyrolysis of feedstocks such as kerosene. Further, one company has developed a process for production of methane, benzene and ethane by hydropyrolysis of kerosine, and another process, known as dynacracking, which employs hydropyrolysis for upgrading of resids. The latter process utilizes a special type of reactor, the lower part of which is used as a gasifier to produce the synthesis gas necessary for the hydropyrolysis reaction. Reported studies of the hydropyrolysis of ethane, propane, n butane, and isobutane at 1000 psig and 600 7000C, showed that propane hydropyrolysis is nearly 30 times faster than that of ethane. The rate constants for propane, nbutane, and isobutane hydropyrolysis were clearly higher than those found for ordinary thermal cracking. The important observation was also made that formation of aromatic hydrocarbons during hydropyrolysis of paraffins and cycloparaffins is gradually suppressed by increase in the concentration of hydrogen. Others have studied the cracking of indan and tetralin in the presence of hydrogen at temperatures from 460 5400C, total pressure from 10 to 160 atmospheres, and hydrogen hydrocarbon ratios of 2 to 100. They reported that the hydroaromatic ring opens readily and that alpha ring opening cleavage of C C bond adjacent to the benzene ring is apparently preferred to beta ring opening. Hydropyrolysis of n butylbenzene products mainly styrene, ethylbenzene, and toluene, whereas n propylbenzene yields predominantly styrene and ethylbenzene. These products are believed to be formed mainly by decomposition of resonance stabilized benzylic radicals, derived from the starting alkylbenzenes. As mentioned previously, hydrodealkylation of alkylaromatics is a major process for production of unsubstituted arenes. Most important of these processes is the production of benzene from toluene, as about two thirds of the total toluene presently produced is dealkylated to benzene. Processing conditions for dealkylation are usually 600 8000C and 25 40 atm. During hydrodealkylation, hydropyrolysis of paraffins and naphthenes, present in the feed, also occurs Hydropyrolysis is highly exothermic and the heat of reaction varies from 55 60 kcal mol. Researchers have also reported that hydrodealkylation of toluene follows first order with respect to toluene and one half order with respect to hydrogen. In the presence of excess hydrogen the reaction was much simpler, as compared to the complex pyrolysis process in its absence. The activation energies for hydrodealkylation were found to be about 45 kcal mol for t oluene, p xylene and o xylene, as compared to activation energies of 77.5, 76.2 and 74.8 kcal mol, respectively, for low pressure thermal cracking of these compounds in the absence of hydrogen. Frequency factors for hydrodealkylation were also low, i.e. 108, as compared to 1013 during thermal cracking. This has led to the conclusion that the reaction has a chain character in the presence of hydrogen.Later workers have reported an activation energy of 50 55 kcal mol for the hydrodealkylation of toluene. Framework and Objectives of the Present Invention One of the main objectives of the present work was to try and develop a versatile hydropyrolysis process for heavy liquids, which would totally or partially eliminate undesirable coke formation while increasing the yield of light liquid products. In order to determine the optimal operating conditions for such a process an investigation of model compounds, e.g. n paraf fins, naphthenes, and naphthenoaromatics was first performed. See Examples 1 6 .
