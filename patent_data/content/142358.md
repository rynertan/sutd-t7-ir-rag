# Solid state scanner for a variable speed document transport.

## Abstract
Scanning apparatus for generating data representing images on a document 10 includes a solid state time integrating photodetector array 12 and means for cycling the array to generate data signals representing the images, a document transport system 22, 30 for relatively moving the array and the document 10 to optically present successive images to said array and a synchronisation device 40 for handling the data. The synchronisation device comprises means 24, 26, 28 responsive to movement of the document relative to the array for producing an enabling pulse signal each time the document has moved a predetermined amount with respect to the array, means 103, 105 for producing clock pulse signals to cycle the linear array, and logic means 121, 123, 125 responsive to the enabling pulse signals and the clock pulse signals for gating out for further processing only those data signals generated by the array upon the occurrence of a predetermined relationship between the times of occurrence of one of the enabling pulse signals and one of the clock pulse signals.
