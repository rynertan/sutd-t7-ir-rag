# Full adder.

## Abstract
A full adder is disclosed which comprises a first exclusive OR circuit 4 for OR processing a first input signal DA and a second input signal DB , a second exclusive OR gate 6 for OR processing an output signal E of the first exclusive OR gate 4 and a third input signal DC , and select circuit 8 for selecting one of the first and second input signals DA, DB and the third input signal DC according to a logical level of the output signal E of the first exclusive OR gate 4 . A sum signal of the first to third input signals DA, DB and DC is obtained by the first exclusive Or means 4 and the second exclusive OR means 6 . The select means 8 selects either the first or second input signal DA or DB or the output signal E of the third input signal DC according to a logical level of the output signal E of the first exclusive OR means 4 . The selected signal is used as a carry signal.
