# SNAP IN CYLINDERS FOR REVOLVERS

## Abstract
A revolver has a cylinder which is completely remov able. Upon actuation of an ejection lever, the cylinder is automatically ejected laterally of the revolver frame. A new fully loaded interchangeable cylinder is then quickly and easily snapped into place within the revolver frame. This replacement is effected without visual supervision or special training. The speed and simplicity of the reloading process make the revolver suitable for use by law enforcement personnel.
