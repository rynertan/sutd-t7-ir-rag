# Pressure reducing device for a pneumatic transport device for particulate material.

## Abstract
Pressure reducing device for a pneumatic transport device for particulate material or for the transport of a gas containing solid impurities with a first transport channel 12 and a second transport channel 14 , the two transport channels being arranged so that, at the transition between the first transport channel 12 and the second transport channel 14 , the gas material flow is bent through an angle of the order of magnitude of 180 . Downstream of the bend a throttle means is provided consisting of an annular nozzle 24 , the inlet side 40 thereof being arcuate in the radial section. The pressure reducing device may be included in a transportation system for feeding out particulate material from a container under a high pressure to a container under a lower pressure, for example dust from a dust separator in a PFBC plant to a collecting container.
