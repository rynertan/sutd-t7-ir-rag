# Optical fibre terminations.

## Abstract
An optical fibre array termination is formed from two housing parts 14,15 each of which has a flat surface 21 with a step 17,18 on the surface, the height of the step corresponding to a fibre diameter. One part is placed over the other so that a rectangular aperture 11 is defined between the steps and a plurality of optical fibres are closely juxtaposed in the aperture. The parts are then secured together.

## Claims
1. A method of forming an optical fibre array termination comprising forming a first housing part having a flat surface with a step thereon, said step having a height corresponding to the diameter of each optical fibre, forming a second housing part similar to the first housing part, locating one part on the other so that a rectangular aperture is defined between the steps, said fibres being closely juxtaposed in said aperture, and securing the housing parts in position.

## Description
This invention relates to terminations for arrays of optical fibres. A number of techniques are currently under investigation which require a number of optical fibres grouped together in a single termination. It is important that the fibres in this group or array are located precisely particularly in the case of monomode fibres. For example, in a wavelength multiplexer light emerging from one fibre in an array is reflected from a grating into another fibre in the array. Monomode fibres have cores which typically are a few microns in diameter and alignment tolerances of better than 1 micron required in the array. The present invention is concerned with a technique for forming an optical fibre array termination which can meet this requirement. According to the present invention there is provided a method of forming an optical fibre array termination comprising forming a first housing part having a flat surface with a step thereon, said step having a height corresponding to the diameter of each optical fibre, forming a second housing part similar to the first housing part, locating one part on the other so that a rectangular aperture is defined between said steps, said fibres being closely juxtaposed in said aperture, and securing the housing parts in position. The housing parts may be formed from a block of suitable material on which is formed said step, the block being cut into two perpendicularly to said step. The block may be a block of quartz and the step may be formed by glueing a wafer of quartz onto the block. Alternatively, the step can be formed by cutting. The blocks can be glued together to secure them in position. According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided an optical fibre array termination comprising a housing formed from two housing parts each having a stepped surface, the height of each step corresponding to the diameter of an optical fibre, the housing parts being located one on the other so that a rectangular aperture is defined between said steps, and a plurality of optical fibres closely juxtaposed in said aperture. The invention will be described now by way of example only, with particular reference to the accompanying drawings. In the drawings FIGURE 1 is an end view of an optical fibre array termination constructed in accordance with the present invention, and FIGURE 2 is a schematic view showing an application of the termination shown in Figure 1. An optical fibre array termination comprises a plurality of juxtaposed optical fibres 10 which are located in a rectangular aperture 11 in a housing 12. The housing is formed from two housing parts 14,15 each of which has a stepped surface 17,18. The rectangular aperture is defined between the two steps. The array shown in Figure 1 is formed as follows. Each housing part is formed initially. Each housing part comprises a block 20 of quartz with a flat surface 21. A quartz wafer 22 is glued onto the surface 21 using a suitable adhesive. The wafer is then machined so that the step 17 has a height which corresponds to the diameter of the optical fibres to be used in the array. The other housing part can then be formed in the same way. It will be appreciated that the housing parts can be formed from either separate quartz blocks as described, each of which has a wafer attached thereto, or from a single block to which is attached a wafer, the block then being cut into two in a direction perpendicular to the step. When the two housing parts have been formed one is placed on the other as shown in Figure 1 and the fibres are located in the rectangular aperture. An appropriate adhesive is applied between the contacting portions of the housing parts, and between the fibres and housing parts. The two housing parts are squeezed together by applying pressure along the directions shown by arrows A and B. This locates the fibres tightly within the aperture 11. The housing parts are then clamped in position to allow the adhesive to set. Figure 1 shows an array with five fibres and such arrays have been produced satisfactorily using fibres having 125 um outer diameters. It will be appreciated that arrays with other numbers of fibres can be produced. The fibres can be monomode or multimode fibres. The accuracy with which the fibres can be located makes the arrays suitable for many applications. One such application is shown in Figure 2. This drawing shows a grating multiplexer in which light from four fibres in a five fibre linear array 28 is multiplexed into the fifth fibre 29 using a grating 30. Other examples of devices in which the termination element may be used are optical switches and multichannel connectors and detectors.
