# ELECTRO OPTIC CELLS

## Abstract
A Pockels cell 10 comprises an electro optic crystal having front 12 and rear optical faces cut at the Brewster angle to the longitudinal axis of the cell. The cell is surrounded by dielectric material 13 and a pair of longitudinally spaced apart and longitudinally extending electrodes 15, 16 are formed on the dielectric material. Each electrode extends to the edge of its respective optical face. When used for Q switching in a laser system, the orientation of the faces mini mise Fresnel reflection losses while the electrode configura tion ensures that a high extinction ratio may be obtained.
