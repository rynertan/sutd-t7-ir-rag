## Description
The present invention relates to a tool position compensation method, and more particularly to a tool position compensation method which, when a tool on a hand of an industrial robot is replaced, is capable of easily converting the position of a new tool based on the point data taught by the replaced tool. Industrial robots have found widespread use and are being used in many fields in recent years. As the numerical control technology is advanced, more industrial robots are numerically controlled for improved operation. Multi articulation robots have many axes, and are widely used in the welding process as they can perform a highly sophisticated operation. Fig. 7 of the accompanying drawings is a perspective view of a general industrial robot which is an articulated robot having six axes. The articulated robot has a T axis about which an arm assembly rotates, a W axis about which a lower arm is tilted back and forth, a U axis about which an upper arm is tilted vertically, an A axis about which a wrist rotates in a horizontal plane, a B axis about which the wrist moves in a vertical plane, and a C γ axis about which the wrist rolls, these axes being independently controlled. Designated at 1 in Fig. 7 is a base on which the articulated robot is supported. A T ϑ axis servo motor 2 is mounted on the base 1 for turning the axes about the vertical axis Z axis . On the T ϑ axis servo motor 2, there is mounted a T ϑ axis unit 3 rotated by the servo motor 2. A W axis unit 4 is fixedly mounted on the T ϑ axis unit 3, and a W axis arm 5 is rotatably supported by a pivot shaft 5a on the W axis unit 4, the W axis arm 5 being operated by a W axis drive mechanism 6. A U axis arm 7 is rotatably supported by a pivot shaft 7a on the distal end of the W axis arm 5, the U axis arm 7 being operated by a U axis drive mechanism 8. A wrist mechanism 9 is mounted on the distal end of the U axis arm 7. The wrist mechanism 9 is rotated by an A axis servo motor 10, vertically swung by a B axis servo motor 11, and rolled by a C axis servo motor 12. Desired operation is performed by a tool attached to the wrist mechanism 9. The articulated robot of the type described above is disclosed in Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication No. 59 59371, for example. A teach and playback robot control process has widely been used in which a tool is mounted on the hand of a robot, and is manually trained by being moved through steps or points to store such points in a data memory in a control unit, the points later being traced by the tool automatically. However, the training process is considerably difficult to effect. There are many types of tools available and points to be taught are different from tool to tool. Therefore, when a tool is replaced, the new tool has to be trained entirely, which is quite tedious and low in efficiency. EP A 0 062 683 discloses a numerical control system having the features of the preamble of accompanying claim 1. According to the present invention, there is provided a tool position compensation method for correcting the position of a new tool when a tool mounted on a hand of a robot is replaced, wherein An embodiment of the present invention can provide a tool position compensation method which, when a tool mounted on a hand of a robot is replaced, is capable of easily and accurately correcting the tool position of a new tool by obtaining information on the axes of the robot after the tool has been replaced, on the basis of tool position information prior to the tool change. Therefore, the taught information prior to the tool change can effectively utilized, and the tool position compensation due to the tool change can easily and accurately be carried out. Reference is made, by way of example, to the accompanying drawings in which An embodiment of the present invention will hereinafter be described in detail with reference to the drawings. Fig. 6 is a diagram explanatory of coordinate systems for a robot, its hand, and a tool. Designated at X, Y, Z is a reference coordinate system for the robot, having an origin O. Denoted at Fig. 1 is explanatory of the manner in which a tool 16 is mounted on the distal end of a robot hand 15. Fig. 1 a hereinafter referred to as a reference condition and Fig. 1 b hereinafter referred to as a second condition differ from each other only as to the length of the tool shank, and are defined in the same tool coordinate system hereinafter referred to as tool coordinate system 1 . The relationship between the reference condition and the second condition is defined as a pattern 1. Where a tool 16 3 is mounted on the distal end of the robot hand 15 as shown in Fig. 1 c hereinafter referred to as a third condition , the tool center point TCP and the coordinate system are different from those in the reference condition. The relationship between the reference condition and the third condition is defined as a pattern 3. Processes of tool position compensation in the patterns 1 and 2 will be described below. Fig. 4 is illustrative of the flow of a tool position compensation process in the pattern 1. Data items T₁ Then, the control device computes the robot axis data items T₂, W₂, U₂, C₂, B₂, A₂ based on the above computed data items x₁, y₁, z₁, Therefore, the tool position compensation can easily and accurately be effected in the pattern 1 based on the data items taught before the tool is replaced. Fig. 5 is illustrative of the flow of a tool position compensation process in the pattern 2. Data items T₁, W₁, U₁, C₁, B₁, A₁ on the axes of the robot which are taught in the reference condition are converted into robot axis data items T₃, W₃, U₃, C₃, B₃, A₃ usable in the third condition in the following manner Then, the control device computes the tool posture vector Then, the control device computes hand posture vector It is apparent that direct and inverse conversions can always be effected between the hand posture vectors To determine M , the values of the axes of the robot are used as setting data, and the hand posture vectors the conversion between the hand posture vectors ℓ, m, n and the tool posture vectors Finally, the control device computes the values of the robot axes based on the obtained data items x₁, y₁, z₁, The tool position compensation after the tool has been replaced can be effected in the pattern 2, using the information prior to tool change. Fig.2 shows the conversion in the pattern 1, in which the tool position is corrected in the longitudinal direction of the shank thereof. Fig. 3 is illustrative of the conversion in the pattern 2, in which the tool position is corrected in the grip point and the grip direction. Although a certain preferred embodiment has been shown and described, it should be understood that many changes and modifications may be made therein without departing from the scope of the invention. According to a tool position compensation method of the invention, as described above, when a tool mounted on a hand of a robot is replaced, information on the axes of the robot after the tool is replaced is obtained by employing information of the robot axes which is taught before the tool is replaced and tool position information at that time. Since the tool position compensation arising from a tool change can easily and accurately be carried out, the tool position compensation method of the invention can be preferably used in numerically controlled machine tools, welding machines, and the like which effect various operations.
