# ELECTRICAL DEVICE INCLUDING A PRINTED CIRCUIT

## Abstract
An electrical arrangement includes a structural member consisting of a moulded low temperature thermosetting plastics material. The member acts as a substrate for an electrical circuit formed as a pattern of cured electrical polymer inks. This avoids the need in many instances for conventional flat printed circuit boards.
