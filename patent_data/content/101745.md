# ROTARY COMPRESSOR.

## Abstract
A compressor which has a rotor 53 slidably provided with vanes 52 slidable vanes 52 provided in the rotor 53 a non circular cylinder 50 containing the rotor 53 therein side plates attached to the two side surfaces of the cylinder 50 to seal the sides surfaces of blade chambers 51 A , 51 B formed by the vanes 52 , the rotor 53 and the cylinder 50 suction holdes 56 A , 56 B and discharge holes 57 A , 57 B . This construction suppresses the freez ing capacity during high speed driving by utilizing the suction loss when the pressure of a blade chamber is reduced to below the pressure of a coolant supply source during a suction stroke, the configuration is designed to vary in at least two stages so that the effective area of the passage from the suction hole within the blade chamber in the second half of the suction stroke is smaller than that in the first half, thereby obtaining an effective suppression effect on the freezing capacity during high speed driving while maintain ing low torque at low speeds and a high volumetric efficiency.
