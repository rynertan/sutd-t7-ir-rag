# An exhaust brake modulating control system.

## Abstract
An exhaust brake modulating control system is provided for an internal combustion engine having a turbocharger T and source of pressurized fluid 34 . The system includes a double acting piston cylinder assembly A having one cylin der end 26a communicating with the engine exhaust man ifold and an opposite end 26b separated from the one end by a piston head 35 . An adjustable control valve 31 is provided having an outlet 31a connected to the cylinder second end, and a plurality of inlets 31b, 31e selectively connected to the outlet. One inlet 31e communicates with the pressurized fluid source and a second inlet 31b is vented to the atmos phere. Communicating with the exhaust manifold is an inlet 16 of a hollow section 14 in which a rotor 15 is rotatably mounted. The hollow section 14 has an outlet 17 separated from the inlet by the rotor. The outlet 17 communicates with the turbine wheel chamber of the turbocharger. When the rotor assumes a first selected position, substantially unre stricted exhaust gas flow past the rotor occurs. When the rotor assumes a second selected position, gas flow is substantially blocked by the rotor. The rotor and piston head are opera tively connected whereby the rotor is responsive to relative movement of the piston head within the cylinder. When the control valve connects the cylinder second end to the pressur ized fluid source, the fluid pressure will balance a predeter mined gas pressure on the piston head whereby the head will cause the rotor to assume a position that generates a pre determined exhaust braking effect.
