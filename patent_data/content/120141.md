## Description
DESCRIPTION Cr DOPED GADOLINIUM GALLIUM GARNET LASER BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention This invention relates to lasers and, more particularly, to a solid state laser whose laser medium is a single crystal of GGG Cr Gd3Ga5O12 Cr3 2. Description of the Prior Art A number of solids, both crystals and glasses, have been found to be suitable for laser action since the first solid state laser was demonstrated by Maiman in 1960. Generally, the laser active materials involve a rare earth, actinide, or transition metal dopant in a crystalline or glass host. An extensive treatment of then known solid state lasers was published in 1976 Solid State Laser Engineering, W. Koechner, SpringerVerlag, New York. More recently, a compilation of laser crystals was presented in Laser Crystals, A.A.Kaminskii, Springer Verlag, New York 1981 . GGG is among the garnet structure crystalline laser materials tabulated by Kaminskii p. 404 . The activator ions 3 3 3 disclosed are all rare earths Nd , Ho , Er and Yb p. 453 . Laser action has also been demonstrated in 3 GdScGa Cr garnet A. Beimowski et al., XIIth Int l. Quantum Electronics Conference, Munich, June, 1982 3 alexandrite BeAl2O4 Cr , a naturally occurring mineral having the chrysoberyl structure U.S. PatentsRe 31,057 and 4,272,733 and emerald, Be3A12 SiO3 6 Cr M.L.Shand and J.C. Walling, IEEE J. Quantum Electron.QE 18, 1829, November 1982 . Among the distinctive features of the alexandrite and emerald lasers is their tunability. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In accordance with the present invention, a laser is provided that comprises a laser medium comprising a single crystal of GGG Cr3 Gd3Ga5O12 Cr3 and pump means for exciting the laser medium to emit coherent radiation. Generally, the laser includes mirrors forming an optical resonator adapted for maintaining laser oscillations between the mirrors. The output of the laser is broadly tunable thus, if the laser includes tuning means the output can be selected at any wavelength in the deep red to near infrared range of the electromagnetic spectrum. Besides tunability, another advantage provided 3 by the GGG Cr laser medium is 4 level operation. A 4 level laser is a class of lasers characterized by the fact that the terminal level for the laser transition is not the ground state of the ion. In these lasers there can be little if any reabsorption of laser emission by the unexcited ground state ions within the laser host.This permits low threshold, high efficiency operation of the laser. In GGG Cr , as in other phonon terminated lasers, the laser transition involves the simultaneous emission of a photon and a phonon, so any reabsorption of this emission requires the simultaneous absorption of both quanta. The probability of this reabsorption is understandably low, so the threshold for GGG Cr3 4 level laser action is low. The laser of the present invention has several advantages over previously known tunable lasers. The laser is simpler than dye lasers, which require a pump to circulate the dye, which, in turn, is generally unstable and toxic, corrosive, or both. As with otherCr3 doped tunable solid state lasers, the present laser emits partly in the visible portion of the spectrum, operates at room temperature, and shows increasing gain with increasing temperature. The laser provides high power operation with less need for auxiliary equipment, and Q switched operation is also possible.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The laser medium employed in this invention comprises a single crystal of gadolinium gallium garnet doped with Cr3 Gd3Ga5O12 Cr3 . The GGG Cr3 is excited by a pump source of incoherent or coherent radiation and emits coherent radiation at a wavelength in the deep red to near infrared range of the electromagnetic spectrum. A tuning means may be incorporated in the laser to permit the output wavelength to be selected. Chromium doped gadolinium gallium garnet is a cubic crystal that can be prepared synthetically byCzochralski growth. For use as a laser medium, aGGG Cr3 crystal is preferably either rod shaped or slab shaped. A slab preferably has a substantially rectangular cross section in a plane normal to its long dimension, with the width thickness ratio of the rectangle equal to or greater than 2. The GGG Cr3 laser medium is optically pumped.In general, it is desirable to have pump radiation absorbed uniformly throughout the laser medium. Since absorption depends on chromium concentration, there is an inverse relationship between rod diameter or slab thickness and optimum dopant concentration. For typical diameters and thicknesses, the chromium dopant concentration is preferably in the range from about 0.005 to about 20 atom percent with respect to gallium octahedral sites, more preferably from about 0.02 to about 5 atom percent. Since 40 of the gallium is on octahedral sites the remainder is on tetrahedral sites, where chromium doesn t locate , the atom percent of chromium with respect to total gallium is correspondingly less. Suitable pump lamps are those that emit strongly in the wavelength region in which GGG Cr3 absorbs shown in Fig. 1 . For example, either pulsed or continuous lamps that emit intense incoherent light at wavelengths shorter than about 700 nm are suitable.Such lamps, well known in the art, include gaseous discharge lamps1 filled with xenon and or krypton and designed to operate either continuous wave cw or pulsed, and metallic vapor sources such as mercury, sodium, cesium, rubidium, and or potassium. A cw mercury arc lamp has been found particularly suitable as a pumping source for cw laser operation, and a pulsed xenon arc lamp particularly suitable as a pumping source for pulsed laser operation. 3 Alternatively, the GGG Cr laser medium may be pumped with a coherent light source, either pulsed or cw, that emits in the wavelength region in which emerald absorbs. For cw excitation the krypton ion and argon ion lasers are representative. For pulsed laser excitation, almost any coherent source having adequate power and an emission wavelength below 700 nm would be an effective pump for the present laser. Examples of suitable sources are doubled Nd YAG, excimer lasers, and nitrogen lasers. In addition to the basic elements of the laser, i.e., the laser medium and optical pump, the laser of the present invention may optionally include means forQ switching. The Q switch spoils the quality factor,Q, of the cavity for an interval of time during which energy is stored. At the appropriate moment, theQ switch is turned to the high gain condition, and the stored energy in the medium is suddenly released in a giant pulse of very short duration. Q switch means may comprise a saturable dye absorber, an acousto optic Q switch, or a polarizer and Pockels cell placed in the beam path. The polarizer may be omitted, particularly at low excitation power. The laser may also be modelocked to produce pulse widths inversely related to the bandwidth. The wavelength range over which GGG Cr3 lases can be seen by reference to Fig. 2, where the single pass gain is shown. The single pass gain, AG, is defined by AG Qn Ip Iu , where 1p is the intensity of a probe beam after passing through a rod that is pumped and 1u is the intensity of the probe beam after passing through an unpumped rod. It can be seen that gain and, consequently, laser emission is observed in a wavelength range from about 715 nm to about 800 nm.Since there is no ground state absorption at wavelengths longer than 730 nm, AG is due entirely to laser gain in that region. Below 730 nm, part of AG is due to ground state absorption. To accomplish tuning, any conventional tuning means may be used. Examples of suitable tuning means include a prism, optical grating, birefringent filter, multilayer dielectric coated filter, or lens having longitudinal chromatic aberration. Particularly suitable is a birefringent filter of the general type described by G. Holtom and 0. Teschke, Design of aBirefringent Filter for High Power Dye Lasers, IEEEJ. Quantum Electron. QE 10, 577 1974 . This type of filter is sometimes referred to as a Lyot filter. B. Lyot, Compt. Rend. 197, 1593 1933 . 3 A high power GGG Cr laser may comprise the basic laser, as described above, as the oscillator stage of a laser amplifier. The amplifier uses such an oscillator stage to provide input radiation for one or more amplifier stages, which typically include a 3 GGG Cr crystal and flashlamp, or other pump source, mounted inside an optical cavity. 3 An advantage of GGG Cr as compared with some other tunable solid state laser materials is that it can operate at room temperature and above, in addition to lower temperatures. Depending on the power level, it may be desirable to include means for controlling the laser rod temperature. Temperature control means may be any of those well known in the art for example, a circulating fluid adapted for absorbing heat from, or transmitting heat to, the laser medium. The circulating fluid may be air, water, a cryogenic liquid, etc. A heater is used to control the fluid temperature when necessary. As the temperature is increased, a limitation on laser operation is set by a corresponding reduction of the lifetime of the excited state of chromium ions.Excitation is best accomplished during a time interval that is of the order of the lifetime, or shorter. If the lifetime is reduced below about 60 ps, flashlamps having a useful operating life are not readily available to provide sufficient excitation in the required short time interval. Fig. 3 illustrates a laser apparatus of this 3 invention. The laser medium 11, comprising a GGG Cr crystal, and pumping source 12 are housed in container 10, which has a highly reflective inner surface 13 which defines an elliptical cavity. Reflection at surface 13 may be diffuse or specular. The axes of the laser medium 11 and the pumping source 12 are each located along a focal line of the ellipse formed by container 10. Laser medium 11 is normally provided with coated ends 14 and 15 having a conventional dielectric anti reflection coating. Completely reflecting mirror 17, optional tuning element 20, and partially reflecting mirror 18 are positioned external to container 10 along cylindrical axis 19 of laser medium 11. Lasing action is evidenced by emission of highly collimated coherent radiation whose wavelength is determined by the orientation of the tuning element 20.The radiation, shown as arrow 16, emanates from partially reflecting mirror 18. Mirrors 17 and 18 may both be partially reflecting. If necessary to maintain the desired operating temperature, laser medium 11 and pumping source 12 are cooled by a fluid circulated through container 10. An optional Q switch is shown as comprising polarizer 21 and Pockels cell 22. As shown in Fig. 4, an amplifier stage may be used with the apparatus of Fig. 3 in a high power laser system of this invention. The apparatus of Fig. 3 is then considered the oscillator stage of the amplifier.The amplifier stage is located in the output beam of the oscillator stage. It consists essentially of a container 30 which has a highly reflective inner surface 33 which defines an elliptical cavity. An amplifier rod 31, excited by flash lamp 32, is normally provided with coated ends 34 and 35 having a conventional dielectric anti reflection coating. The amplifier rod may be of larger diameter than the oscillator rod 11, in which case a beam expanding telescope 36 is located between the stages in order to match the beam size to the rod size. Unlike the oscillator stage, the amplifier stage normally does not have mirrors at its ends to form a cavity, and the amplification of the oscillator output occurs during only one pass of the laser beam through the amplifier rod.However, for some applications, the amplifier may be fitted with partially reflecting mirrors to feed back part of the amplifier output into the amplifying medium. The spectral and temporal characteristics of the output of this regenerative oscillator can then be determined by injecting a suitably tailored signal from the primary oscillator in a manner similar to that employed with the single pass amplifier. More than one amplifier stage may be used. The amplified output shown as arrow 37 emanates from amplifier rod 31. The following Example is presented in order to provide a more complete understanding of the invention. The specific techniques, conditions, materials, and reported data set forth to illustrate the principles and practice of the invention are exemplary and should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention. EXAMPLE A GGG Cr3 rod 66 mm long x 6.3 mm diameter was mounted in a water cooled ceramic flashlamp housing. The optical cavity had a reflective mirror at one end and a 95 output mirror at the other end.Both mirrors were concave, with a 4 m focal length.The rod was pumped with two 100 s duration xenon flashlamps operating in parallel, each providing 169J pulses at 2 Hz. A probe beam was provided by aRr laser pumped dye laser emitting at wavelengths in the range from 700 nm to 835 nm. The resultant emission showed gain in the range from about 715 nm to about 800 nm.
