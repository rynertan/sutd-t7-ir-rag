# Method of producing sheets of crystalline material.

## Abstract
A method of producing sheets of crystalline material, wherein a growth mask is formed upon a substrate 56 and crystallizable material is deposited over the substrate and the mask. The crystallizable material is caused to crystal lize and undergo lateral epitaxial growth over the surface of the mask to form a sheet of crystalline material which is op tionally separated so that the substrate can be reused. Crys tallization and growth are obtained by applying energy to the crystallizable material using a stationary heater 65 and a movable strip heater 63 . Alternatively, the crys tallizable material is raised above its melting point by a scanned or pulsed electron or laser beam.
