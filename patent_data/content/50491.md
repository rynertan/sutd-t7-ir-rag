## Description
IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO CAMERSi SUPPLEMENTAL LIGHTING DEVICES AND TO CAMERAS This invention relates to camera supplemental lighting devices and to cameras. When a video or cinematograph camera is used to record a scene in which the level of lighting can alter abruptly it is difficult to adequately compensate for the changes in lighting level by varying the aperture of the camera. A particular example of when this difficulty arises occurrs in recording a scene in a sports stadium one side of which is in bright sunlight and the other side of which is in shadow. In following a race around a track in the stadium, the camera has to be adjusted very rapidly as the camera follows the event around the track, very rapid adjustments have to be made to compensate as the camera moves from a brightly lit scene to a scene in shadow. In practice it is almost impossible to compensate adequately and so the film or video record particularly of the parts shot in shadow is invariably poor.The same problem arises when using a still camera for recording a series of scenes where the lighting level varies substantially from scene to scene. This invention provides a camera lighting device comprising a housing having means on one side thereof to mount the housing on a camera body, means on the opposite side thereof to mount a lens system on the housing, a light path through the housing for light from the lens to the camera, a substantially transparent reflector mounted in the light path at an angle to the light path and a light source in the housing to one side of the light path to direct light on to the reflector and thence into the camera body to supplement the light received from the lens system. The supplemental lighting device can be used to supply additional light to the camera as the camera moves into a scene in shadow or when the lighting of the scene being recorded has dropped sharply for any other reason to enhance the latent image being recorded on film or video tape. By setting the supplemental light at an appropriate level to compensate for the reduction in the light value of the scene being recorded in shadow as compared with the sunlit scene, a substantial improvement in the image as recorded on the film of the scene is achieved. Since the device is located between the lens system and the camera body and there is no lens between the device and the film or video plane of the camera, the light source of the device is not itself focussed off to the film or video plane but merely provides a general level of illumination across the film plane. Means may be provided in the housing for mounting a filter or filters between the lens and the reflector and out of said light path through the housing to colour the light to be directed by the reflector from the lamp into the camera body. This facility enables the colour of the scene being photographed to be corrected by the supplemental light from the device to provide a better balance in the colouring of the image being photographed. For example outdoor scenes being photographed on a brightly sunlit day under blue sky are normally over blue particularly in the shadow areas and this can be compensated for by appropriate colourinG of the supplemental light added. The invention also provides a camera having a lens, a shutter mechanism, a film plane and a supplemental lighting device comprising a substantially transparent reflector mounted at an angle in the light path between the lens system and film plane and a supplemental light source disposed to one side of the reflector out of said light path to direct additional light on to the reflector and thence on to the film plane to supplement the light received through the lens system. The following is a description of one specific embodiment of the invention, reference being made to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a diagrammatIc view of a camera supplemental lighting device Figure 2 is a section taken through the device illustrated in Figure 1 and Figure 3 illustrates the device as applied to a camera. Referring firstly to Figures 1 and 2 of the drawings, there is shown a camera supplemental lighting device comprising a housing indicated generally at 10 having.a lower part il and an upper part 12. The lower part 11 of the housing has a front wall 13 and a back wall 14 and is generally square in transverse cross section. The front wall 13 of the housing is formed with a large circular aperture 15 and the front face of the wall around the aperture is formed with a recess 16 in which an internally screw threaded mounting ring not shown is fixed to receive the screw threaded end of a lens system. The rear wall 14 of the housing is formed with a similar aperture co axial with the front wall aperture and encircled by a screw threaded mounting ring for fixing the housing 10 to the front of a camera body. The apertures in the front and rear walls of the upper part of the housing provide a light path between a lens system and the camera body through the housing as described later. Within the housing between the front and rear walls a transparent reflector 17 is mounted at an angle of forty five degrees to the axis of the apertures in the front and rear walls of the housing. The reflector 16 is formed from glass and may be lightly silvered on one side to act as a reflector and at the same time to transmit light received from the lens system at the front of the housing into the camera body at the rear of the housing substantially un impaired. The reflector may, alternatively, be formed from a transparent plastics. In the upper part of the housing 12 a lamp 18 preferably of the tungsten halogen type is mounted on spaced pairs of contacts 19.A reflector 20 is mounted inthe bottom of the upper part of the housing 12 so that substantially all the light from the lamp 18 is reflected upwardly into the lower part of the housing. The lamp 18 is powered through a cable 21 connected to a power pack 22 containing conventional re chargeable batteries and controlled by an on off switch 23. The power output from the pack 22 can be varied by a control 24 to vary the power supply to the lamp 18 and thereby the illumination provided by the lamp. At the bottom of the upper part of the housing 12 a slide carrier 25 is mounted to receive a filter tray 26 which can be slid into the housing through a slot 12ain one side of the housing. The filter tray 26 carries a. filter or filter pack 27 of 2 predetermined colour to colour the light emitted by the lamp 18 in any particular required way. Light from the lamp 18 at a power determined by the power pack control passes up through the filter 27 and is reflected from the back face 17a of the reflector 17 into the camera body to supplement light from the scene being photographed through the lens system which passes directly through the reflector 17 and into the camera body. By adjusting the level of the light from the lamp, the latent image recorded on the film can be enhanced without impairing the sharpness and contrast of the image of the scene being photographed. By selection of a suitable filter or filter pack 27, the colouring of the image can be un changed or can be corrected or varied in any way required. Reference is now made to Figure 3 of the drawings which shows the application of the device to a camera. The camera is indicated at 28 and a telephoto lens system for the camera is indicated at 29. It will be seen that the telephoto lens system 29Is mounted on the front of the device the device taking the place of the normal distance tube at the end of the lens system and the camera 28 is mounted at the rear of the device. The depth of the device that is between the front and rear walls thereof is such that the telephoto lens system 29 is correctly focussed in relation to the film plane of the camera. The device is equally applicable to other forms of camera including conventional reflex cameras and is equally applicable to film and video cameras. The device can be used both with telephoto and conventional lenses provided that the lens can focus correctly to the film plane of the camera with the device in position.The device could also be made as part of the lens of the camera or part of the camera body in which case the housing of the device would be built as part of the camera body. The device can also be used in conjunction with a camera using a bellows system with the device located between the bellows and camera lens. Such arrangements can be used in normal photography or for re photographing previously exposed transparencies or positives for controlling the contrast in the reproduced negative.
