# Sized carbon fibers and thermoplastic polyester based composite structures employing the same.

## Abstract
The present invention is directed to carbon fibers which are coated on the surface with a sizing agent of either a polyisocyanate, such as polymethylene polyphenyl polyiso cyanate, or a sorbitol polyglycidyl ether having a specifically defined total chlorine content and epoxide equivalent weight. The coated carbon fibers are employed to prepared carbon fiber composites wherein the matrix resin is a thermoplastic polyester such as poly 1,4 butylene terephtha late . The matrix resin of the composite exhibits improved bonding with the coated carbon fibers thereby imparting improved interlaminar shear strength to the composite.
