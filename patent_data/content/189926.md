# Magnetic bubble memory module.

## Abstract
By disposing a magnetic bubble memory chip loaded on a flexible substrate in a space section formed by a picture frame core providing coils so as to make each pair of opposite windings parallel with each other and holding the whole of said coil, said core and said magnetic bubble memory chip by laying them between a pair of upper and lower cases made of good conducting materials, it is possible to decrease the overall thickness of the module and to solidly support the chip by means of the case.
