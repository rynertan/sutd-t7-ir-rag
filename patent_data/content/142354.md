The gels used had the following molar ratios SiO2 A12O3 25 K20 Na2O A12O3 18 K20 Na20 Si02 0.72 H2O Kzo Na2O 20 K2O Na2O 0.5 Crystallization temperatures of 90 C and 980C were employed.Y Nishiimura in Nippon Kagaku Zasshi 91, 11, 1970, pp 1046 9 describes in general terms zeolite L preparation from a synthesis mixture containing colloidal silica, potassium aluminate and potassium hydroxide having a SiO2 A12O3 ratio of 15 25 at a temperature of 100 , but exemplifies only two synthesis mixtures having the following ratios of components 7g20 Al203 20SiO2 450H2O and 8K20 Al203 10si02 500H2o.US 3 298 780 describes the preparation Qf zeoliteUJ by a process in which an aqueous reactant solution having a composition, expressed as mole ratios of oxides, corresponding toSi02 A1203 of from 6 to 30,R2 V0 Si02 of from 0.30 to 0.70, andH2O R2 VO of from 80 to 140 is maintained at a temperature between 150 F 65.6ÂµC and 325 F 162.80C until the zeolite crystals are formed. Zeolite UJ is described as having nearly cubic shaped crystals with a crystal size ranging upward from 0.05 micron.GB 1 393 365 describes zeolite AG1 as being related to zeolite L and prepared by reacting at least one aluminium component, at least one silicon component and at least one alkali metal component, in an aqueous medium, the sole or major silicon component being a water glass having a molar ratio Si02 M20 of 3.5 to 4.0 to give a reaction mixture with oxide molar ratios in one of the following ranges Range 1 Si02 A1203 7 14 K20 Na2O Si02 0.25 0.85 K20 K20 Na20 0.75 1.0 H20 K20 Na2O 25 160 Range 2 Si02 Al203 14 20 K20 Na2O SiO2 0.25 0.85 K20 K20 Na2O 0.5 1.0 H20 K2 Na20 25 160Range 3 Si02 Al203 20 40 K20 Na20 SiO2 0.25 1.0 K20 K20 Na20 0.4 1.0 H20 K20 Na20 25 160 at a temperature of from 50 to 1500C. It was subsequently found that zeolite L may be used as a catalyst base in aromatization reactions. US 4 104 320 discloses dehydrocyclization of aliphatic compounds in the presence of hydrogen using a catalyst comprising zeolite L and a group VIII metal. European PatentApplication Publication 40119 discloses a dehydrocyclization process operating at low pressure 1 to 7 bars or low H2 hydrocarbon ratio using a catalyst comprising platinum on a potassium zeolite L. BE 888365 describes dehydrocyclization using a catalyst comprising platinum, rhenium incorporated in the form of its carbonyl and sulphur to give an atomic ratio of sulphur to platinum of 0.05 to 0.6 on a zeolitic crystalline aluminosilicate base such as zeolite L. BE 792608 discloses the treatment of zeolite L for use as catalyst in isomerization by exchange with ammonium and chromium ions. In our copending European Patent Application Publication No. 96479 there is described and claimed a new form of zeolite material similar to conventionally prepared zeolite L, but having a characteristic morphology and size, which is particularly valuable for use as a catalyst base in hydrocarbon conversions such as aromatization.This zeolite has an X ray diffraction XRD pattern obtained with CuKok radiation having the following significant d i values TABLE A 16.1 0.4 7.52 0.05 6.00 0.04 4.57 0.04 4.35 0.04 3.91 0.02 3.47 0.02 3.28 0.02 3.17 0.02 3.07 0.02 2.91 0.02 2.65 0.02 2.46 0.02 2.42 0.01 2.19 0.01 and comprising crystallites in the form of cylinders with a mean diameter of at least 0.1 micron, preferably at least 0.5 micron. The above XRD lines characterize the zeolite of the invention and correspond to those identified as characteristic of zeolite L inUS 3 216 789. The spectrum of the zeolite will also generally show additional lines, but in general the ten most prominent peaks in the XRD pattern of the materials of the invention are given in Table B below TABLE B 16.1 0.4 4.57 0.04 3.91 0.02 3.66 0.02 3.47 0.02 3.28 0.02 3.17 0.02 3.07 0.02 2.91 0.02 2.65 7 0.02The positions and relative intensites of the X ray lines are found to vary only slightly for various alkali and alkaline earth metal cation forms of the materials.However, the intensity of the line at d 16.1 .3 oA has been observed to be more variable than that of other prominent lines. This is believed to be a result of the sensitivity of this peak to the preparation of the XRD sample and not to significant changes in crystal structure of the zeolite. Occasionally, additional lines not belonging to the pattern for zeolite L appear in a pattern along with the X ray lines characteristic of the zeolite. This is an indication that one or more additional crystalline materials are mixed with zeolite L in the sample being tested. While the presence of some additional materials may be tolerated without the catalytic properties of the zeolite L being affected too adversely, it is a preferred feature of the invention that the amount of such additional crystalline materials is minimised in the zeolite material as synthesized.The synthesis of the present invention is preferably conducted so that the amount of zeolite W or denser phases in the product of the synthesis is at least reduced to lower levels preferably so that the ratio zeolite W zeolite L as measured by the ratio of o peak heights of lines at d 7.09 0.05 A and d 3.91 o 0.03 A in the CuKoQXRD spectrum of the product is 0.3 or less, more preferably 0.2 or less. The synthesis may be conducted such that the product of the synthesis is substantially free of any additional crystalline phase giving rise to a line in the X ray pattern at o d A value of 6.28 0.05 and or 3.14 0.02.References herein to zeolite W refer to the material described as such by D W Breck in Zeolite MolecularSieves , Wiley Interscience, 1974, also described asZeolite KM in Zeolite Technology and Application,Recent Advances , J Scott, Noyes Data Corpn., USA, 1980, p36.The particular X ray technique and or apparatus employed, the humidity, the temperature, the orientation of the crystals in the sample and other variables, all of which are well known and understood to those skilled in the art of X ray crystallography or diffraction, may also cause some variations in the positions and intensities of the X ray lines. Thus, the X ray data given herein to identify the zeolites prepared in the invention are not to exclude those materials which, due to some variable mentioned above or otherwise known to those skilled in the art fail to show all of the tabulated X ray lines, or show a few extra ones that are permissible to the crystal system of the zeolite, or show a shift in position or slight change in intensity of some of theX ray lines.The copending European Paent Application describes the preparation of the new zeolite material as cylindrical crystallites with an aspect ratio of at least 0.5, in which an alkaline reaction mixture comprising water, a source of silicon and a source of aluminium with a composition falling with the following molar ratios expressed as oxides M2O SiO2 0.22 0.36H2O M2O 25 90SiO2 Al2O3 6 15 wherein M is a cation of valence n, and preferably potassium or a mixture of K M in which M is an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal such as sodium, calcium, barium, or rubidium, provided that K2O M 20 K2O is at least 0.7 is heated to a temperature of from at least 75 C and preferably from about 100it to about 250 C, more preferably from about 1200C to about 225ÂµC, to form the desired cylindrical aluminosilicate.It has now been found that zeolite L may be obtained from crystallization gels with relatively high alumina contents by employing higher crystallization temperatures and shorter crystallization times, and that such high temperature process give improved yields of zeolite L.Thus in one aspect this invention provides a process for the preparation of zeolite L in which an alkaline reaction mixture comprising water, a source of silicon and a source of aluminium with a composition having the following molar ratio expressed as oxides M20 Si02 0.24 0.35, preferably 0.30 0.35H20 M20 35 80Si02 A1203 5.7 7.8, preferably 6 7.5 wherein M is as defined hereinbefore is heated to a temperature of greater than 200 C to form zeolite L, the crystallization preferably being discontinued prior to the transformation of significant amounts of the formed zeolite to other crystalline phases giving lines C 0 at d 6.28 0.05 A and or d 3.14 0.02 A in the XRD spectrum. It has been found that good yields of Zeolite L may be obtained by the processes of the invention, and that products may be prepared similar to those shown in our copending European Application Publication No 96479 to provide an excellent catalyst base for hydrocarbon conversions and particularly aromatization reactions.It is a surprising feature of the present invention that by employing high temperatures of greater than 200 C zeolite L may be formed with relatively alumina rich gels. The ratio of Sio2 Al203 is less than 8.GB 1 202 511 describes low silica gels but, as shown hereinafter, we have found that these prior art gels do not give good yields of zeolite L, but by operating at higher temperatures according to the invention highly crystalline zeolite L in good yields.The dry yields i.e. the yield obtained after fully drying the product for example, by heating to 1500C for 16 hours obtained by the process of the invention are typically greater than 16 wtZ based on the weight of the reaction mixture , and better yields appear to be obtained with lower water contents. Yields of greater than 18E, or even greater than 20 may be obtained, and as shown in the Examples yeilds of greater than 24 have been achieved. Typical yields for the process of European Application PublicationNo 96479 are less than 168. There are four principal components to the reaction mixture or synthesis gel and thus generally aluminium silicon potassium optionally with up to 30 mole replaced by alkali or alkaline earth metal water and the relative proportions of these four components and the chosen reaction conditions must be selected within the ranges specified above to obtain good yields of zeolite L. In perticularR preferred compositions for a process in which the reaction mixture is heated to from 2000C to 2500C to give highly crystalline generally cylindrical particles of Zeolite L have been found to have substantially the following mole ratios 2.5 3.4K2O 1.3 1.66Al2O3 10SiO2 120 180H2O and particularly good results have been obtained by heating to about 225 C. In addition to varying the proportions of the reactants in the reaction mixture it is possible to vary the reaction conditions and in particular the crystallization time and temperature. Within the reactant ratios defined for the process of the invention a lower silicon content and or lower water content and or higher potassium content and thus the alkalinity will generally produce better yields of zeolite L at higher crystallization temperatures 2250C or higher.The crystallization time is critical in the present invention. The high temperatures employed are found to result in rapid formation of zeolite L, which has the advantage of reducing the normally lengthy crystallization time. There is, however, a tendency for other crystalline materials to be formed if the formed zeolite L is held at the crystallization temperature for too long. In particular there is a tendency to form a non zeolite materials which give rise to lines 0 in the XRD pattern CuKa at 6.28 0.05 A and or 3.14 0.02 A. Thus the crystallization is preferably discontinued before there is substantial formation of such other crystalline materials. Typically times of less than 48 hours, preferably of less than 24 hours and generally of 5 to 15 hours will be appropriate.The zeolites formed in the process of the invention are preferably aluminosilicates and are described herein in terms of aluminosilicates, though other elemental substitutions are possible, for example aluminium may be substituted by gallium, boron, iron and similar dior trivalent elements capable of existing in tetrahedral coordination, and silicon may be substituted by elements such as germanium or phosphorus. The aluminosilicates preferably have a composition expressed in terms of molar ratios of the constituent oxides in anhydrous form of 0.9 1.3 M2 nO A1203 xSiO2 I wherein M is a cation of valence n, x is from 5 to 7.5, preferably from 5.7 to 7.4. The products of the process of the invention have high crystallinity as shown by a well defined X ray diffraction pattern without binder or other diluents present with sharp peaks.Crystallinity may be measured relative to a quartz standard by comparing the peak areas for the reflection from the 220 plane d 4.57 0.04 i and the 221 plane d 3.91 0.02 for the zeolitic material of the invention with the peak area for the reflection from the 110 plane d 2.46 0.02 of the quartz.The ratio of the combined peak areas of the 220 and 221 reflections of the zeolitic material to the peak area of the 110 reflection of quartz is a measure of the crystallinity of the sample. To provide a comparison between different samples and to eliminate cation effects the peak area determination is preferably carried out on the same cation form of the zeolite.The exchangeable cation M in general formula I is very preferably potassium, but it is possible for a part of M to be replaced by other cations such as alkali and alkaline earth metals for example sodium, rubidium or caesium. The ratio M2 nO Al2O3 is preferably from 0.95 to 1.15, and generally above 1.In general formula I the symbol x the mole ratioSiO2 Al203 more preferably represents from 6 to 7 and most preferably from 6.0 to 6.5.The aluminosilicate forms of the invention may be hydrated, typically with up to 9 moles of water per mole of Al203. When used as a catalyst base, as described hereinafter, the zeolite of the invention is preferably first calcined to remove water. In normal preparation from aqueous gels a hydrated form is first prepared and this may be dehydrated by heating. scanning electron micrographs SEM of the materials of the invention show these to have a distinct crystal morphology. The preferred products of the process of the invention appear to be generally in the form of cylinders in scanning electron micrographs. The terms cylinder and cylindrical are used herein to describe particles having substantially the shape of a cylinder as defined in solid geometry that is, a solid bounded by a surface generated by a line moving parallel to a fixed line so as to cut a fixed plane curve and by two parallel planes bases which cut the surface. The use of these terms is not intended to exclude particles having minor surface irregularities or displaying typical crystallographic faults or dislocations.In particular, the products of the invention may show roughness on the basal planes of the cylinders, or corrugations on the lateral planes. X ray diffraction shows the products to have a high degree of crystallinity, inherent to the distinctive morphology and which is believed to result from larger domains within the crystall ites. The cylindrical particles of the invention are preferably substantially in the form of circular cylinders circular cross section and most preferably substantially in the form of right circular cylinders wherein the bases are normal to the cylinder axis . Particularly preferred cylindrical particles are those having an aspect ratio the length of the cylinder surface to the diameter of the cylinder of at least 0.5, and more preferably at least 0.8. Particles with the morphology of the products of this invention have been shown to have excellent properties of extending catalyst life when used as catalyst bases for aromatization catalysts. This is in contrast to other morphologies, and in particular particles with cylindrical morphology have been shown better than particles with a clam like shape.The term clam is used to describe particles having two generally convex faces joined to give the appearance of a clam shell. The products of the process of the invention are preferably characterized by at least 50 , more preferably 70 and most preferably 85 , of the crystallites being cylinders.A further particularly surprising feature of the invention is that large crystallites wherein the mean diameter of the cylinders is at least 0.1 micron may be prepared. The cylindrical particles preferably have a mean diameter of at least 0.5 micron. The crystallites more preferably have a mean diameter of from 0.5 to 4 micron and most preferably from 1.0 to 3.0 micron. In the synthesis of the invention, the source of silicon for the reaction mixture is generally silica, and this is usually most conveniently in the form of a colloidal suspension of silica such as Ludox HS 40 available fromE.I. Dupont de Nemours and Co. Colloidal silicon sols are preferred since they result in less contaminating phases. However other forms such as silicates may be used.The source of aluminium may be an alumina introduced into the reaction medium as, for example, Al203.3H2O, previously dissolved in alkali. However, it is also is also possible to introduce aluminium in the form of the metal, which is dissolved in alkali.The process of the invention preferably uses a reaction mixture containing potassium. This potassium is preferably introduced as potassium hydroxide. The reaction mixture may contain small quantities of other metal cations and salt forming anions as already described, but it has been found that there is an increasing tendency for other aluminosilicates to be found as the content of other ions is increased, resulting in less pure forms of the aluminosilicate of the invention. For example, sodium and rubidium ions favour erionite formation, caesium ions favour pollucite formation.Thus it is preferred for potassium hydroxide to be the source of potassium and the source of alkalinity.The product of the processes described above is predominantly a potassium form of the aluminosilicate that is, aluminosilicate where M in general formula I isX. By ion exchange of the product in the manner conventional to zeolite chemistry other cations such as Na orH can be introduced for M.Within the ranges specified hereinbefore for the composition of the reaction mixture it is possible to choose ratios of oxides and alkalinity to given particular forms of the aluminosilicate product. The Sio2 Al2o3 ratio in the product preferably lies in a relatively narrow range of 5.7 to 7.4. The higher the siO2 A1203 ratio in the reaction mixture, the higher the ratio in the product. Also, decreasing alkalinity OH Si 02 tends to increase the SiO2 Al203 ratio in the formed product. Dilution of the reaction mixture with water and thus increasing the H2O K2O ratio also tends to increase the SiO2 Al203 ratio in the product.Other cations such as tetramethylammonium and the presence of other potassium salts can be used to raise the SiO2 Awl 203 ratio, but as described hereinbefore this may also result in the formation of other zeolite forms.The crystallization is generally carried out in a sealed autoclave and thus at autogenous pressure. Lower pressure will require longer crystallization times.Following the preparation as described above the formed zeolite may be separated, washed and dried in the normal manner.The products of the processes of the invention described hereinbefore are preferably substantially free from contaminant crystalline and amorphous materials.However., in employing these products in catalytic applications it may be desired to combine them with additional crystalline or amorphous materials and this invention extends to such combinations. We have found that the products of the invention are excellent catalyst bases and may be used in a wide variety of catalytic reaction. The particular morphology of the crystals appears to result in a particular stable base for catalytically active metals with a surprising resistance to metal catalyst deactivation. In addition, their low acidity which makes them especially suited to catalytic applications where a low acid site strength is advantageous such as aromatization.The catalytically active metal s may be, for example, aGroup VIII metal such as platinum, tin, or germanium as described in US 4 104 320, or a combination of platinum and rhenium as described in GB 2 004 764 or BE 888365.In the latter case the catalyst may for appropriate circumstances also incorporate halogen as described inUS 4 165 276, silver as described in US 4 295 959 andUS 4 206 040, cadmium as described in US 4 295 960 andUS 4 231 897 or sulphur as described in GB 1 600 927.We have found a particularly advantageous catalyst composition to incorporate from 0.1 to 6.0 weight , preferably from 0.1 to 1.5 weight platinum or palladium, since this gives excellent results in aromatization.From 0.4 to 1.2 wt platinum is particularly preferred, especially in conjuction with the potassium form of the aluminosilicate. It mayalso be useful to incorporate into the catalyst one or more materials substantially inert under the conditions in which the catalyst is to be employed to act as a binder. Such binders may also act to improve the resistance of the catalyst to temperature, pressure and attrition.The products of the invention may be used in a process for the conversion of a hydrocarbon feed in which the feed is contacted with a catalyst as described above under appropriate conditions to bring about the desired conversion. They may for example be useful in reactions involving aromatization and or dehydrocyclization and or isomerization and or dehydrogenation reaction.They are particularly useful in a process for the dehydrocyclization and or isomerization of acyclic hydrocarbons in which the hydrocarbons are contacted at a temperature of from 430ÂµC to 5500C with a catalyst comprising an aluminosilicate of the invention having at least 90 of the exchangeable cations M as alkali metal ions and incorporating at least one Group VIII metal having dehydrogenating activity, so as to convert at least part of the acyclic hydrocarbons into aromatic hydrocarbons.The process is preferably otherwise carried out in the manner described in US 4 104 320, ZE 888365 orEP 40119. It has been found that use of the aluminosilicates of the invention in this way enables greatly improved catalyst lifetimes to be achieved as compared to the lifetime obtained with a conventionally prepared zeolite.The invention will now be described in more detail, though only by way of illustration, in the followingExamples.Example 1 Preparation of Zeolite LA synthesis gel was prepared having the following composition expressed in moles of pure oxide 3.2 K2O 1.5A12O3 l0SiO2 160H2O This gel was prepared as follows 17.55g of aluminium hydroxide was dissolved by boiling in an aqueous solution of 30.29g of potassium hydroxide pellets 86 pure KOH in 50.17g of water to form solution A. After dissolution any water loss was corrected. A separate solution, solution B, was prepared by diluting a 113.2g of colloidal silica LudoxHS40 with 89.03g of water. Solutions A and B were mixed for two minutes to form 259.98g of gel, and just before the gel became fully stiff it was transferred to a 300ml stainless steel autoclave, which was transferred to an oven at 225ÂµC. The gel reached 225 C in about 4 hours. The gel was held at that temperature to bring about crystallization the total heat up and crystallization time being 8 hours. 49.0g of Zeolite L were formed 19,98 yield and this was highly crystalline with a typical Zeolite L X ray diffraction XRD pattern. Scanning electron micrographs SEM show the product to be formed solely of generally cylindrical crystals with rough lateral planes having a particle size of 0.5 to 1 microns and an aspect ratio of 1. No zeolite W or crystalline non zeolitic phases were detectable in the XRD pattern.Comparative Example AThe general procedure of Example 1 was repeated for a substantially identical synthesis gel but the crystallization temperature was 150it and the crystallization time was 72 hours. The product contained zeoliteL with a.high proportion of zeolite W. Comparative Example CRepetition of DT 1813099 Example 6A synthesis gel was prepared having substantially the composition described in Example 6 of DT 1813099 equivalent to GB 1 202 511 2.75K20 Al203 8.7SiO2 100H20 7.37g of aluminium hydroxide were dissolved in an aqueous solution of 16.98gms of potassium hydroxide 86 pure KOH in 30.9gms water to Solution A. 25.04g of silica as Aerosil 200 were mixed with 55.4g water for 5 minutes to form Solution B. Solutions A and B were mixed for 1 minute and the formed putty like gel was heated in an autoclave at 140 C for 46.5 hours. The product was separated and dried as in Example 1.XRD and SEM showed the product to be a mixture ofZeolite W with Zeolite L. No cylindrical crystallites were observed. The procedure of DT 1813099 using drier gels and lower crystallization temperatures than the present invention did not result in the highly crystalline zeolite L formed by the invention.
