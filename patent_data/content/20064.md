# Mould for casting ceramic material.

## Abstract
The mould has a plurality of mould parts which include a seat 3 on which the cast article rests when the mould is opened by removing the other mould parts 13, 14, 15, and this seat mould part is made of a noncasting material such as lightweight plastics. The surface region 10 of the seat exposed in the casting cavity is bounded by closely adjacent regions of the other mould parts 13, 14, 19 made of plaster so that although the seat is made of non casting material a solid cast portion of the article is cast against the seat. Such moulds are particularly suitable for casting water closet bowls or bidets, especially in an installation having many such moulds because the seats are all interchangeable.
