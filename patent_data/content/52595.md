# A method for separating and recovering nickel and copper from complex materials.

## Abstract
A method of recovering copper and nickel from sulphidic minerals containing copper, nickel and iron comprises the steps of roasting the mineral, preferably to provide magne tite sulphating, for example with sulphuric acid, sulphur trioxide, metal sulphate and or sulphur dioxide together with oxygen and a subsequent leaching of the sulphated material and recovery of copper from the leaching solution, for example by electrolysis. All or part of the leaching solution with its nickel content is recycled to the roasting stage, and the nickel content is removed in the form of nickel oxide together with the leaching residue, from which nickel can be recovered.
