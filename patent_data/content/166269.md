# Error correction method and system for multiple bit output chips.

## Abstract
An error correction code, especially suited for memory chips with multi bit outputs, in which parity bits are calculated for each byte of the word and check bits are calculated for the word as a whole. In a 4 byte, 32 bit word, eight bits of error correction can correct up to four errors if the errors are re stricted to corresponding bits in the 4 bytes.
