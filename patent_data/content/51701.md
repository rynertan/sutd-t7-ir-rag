# Engine braking apparatus.

## Abstract
Pressure relief apparatus for an internal combustion engine compression relief enginge brake is disclosed. Normally an existing pushrod 74 is used to drive a master piston 66 which in turn controls the motion of a slave piston 50 which opens an enginge exhaust valve 60 . The problem of assigning such additional function to the pushrod is that an increased load may be experienced which may exceed the design capacity of the pushrod. The invention solves this problem by providing a bi stable relief valve 106 in figures 2 and 3 located in a high pressure hydraulic fluid circuit which interconnects the slave and master pistons together with damping means 112 or 122 in figures 2 and 3 adapted to damp out rapidly the oscillations of the valve during the period of its opening so as to maximize the flow of hydraulic fluid through the bi stable valve and minimize the time required to relieve the pressure in the high pressure hydraulic system of the compression relief engine brake. The damping means comprise a spring controlled valve guide 116 or 125 in figures 2 and 3 which inhibits premature reseating of the bi stable valve and maximizes the average opening of the valve during its operating period.

## Description
ENGINE BRAKING APPARATUS TECHNICAL FIELD OF INVENTION This invention relates generally to engine braking apparatus of a gas compression relief type.The invention relates more particularly to a pressure relief apparatus which automatically disables one or more operating cylinders of the compression relief engine brake whenever the forces in the hydraulic circuit of the engine brake exceed a predetermined level. BACKGROUND ART Engine brakes of the compression relief type are well known in the art, Such engine brakes are designed to convert, temporarily, an internal combustion engine of the spark ignition or compression ignition type into ari air compressor so as to develop a retarding horsepower which may be a substantial portion of the operating horsepower normally developed by the engine. As a general rule, so long as the retarding horsepower developed during braking operations does not exceed in absolute value the operating horsepower for which the engine was designed, the stresses on the crankshaft, bearings and drive train, though opposite in direction will not exceed the allowable stresses for these parts and the addition of the compression relief engine brake will not adversely affect the operating life of the drive train components of the engine and vehicle.At the same time, the engine brake will supplement the braking capacity of the primary vehicle wheel braking system and extend, substantially, the life of the primary braking system. The basic design for an engine braking system of the type here involved is disclosed in theCummins U.S. Patent 3,220,392. The compression relief engine brake of the type disclosed in Patent 3,220,392 employs a hydraulic system wherein the motion of a master piston controls the motion of a slave piston which opens the exhaust valve of the internal combustion engine near the end of the compression stroke whereby the work done in compressing the intake air is not recovered during the expansion or power stroke but, instead, is dissipated through the exhaust and radiator systems. The master piston is customarily driven by a pushrod controlled by the engine camshaft. It will be apparent that the force required to open the exhaust valve will be transmitted back through the hydraulic system to the pushrod and camshaft.In order to minimize modification of the engine, it is common to utilize an existing pushrod which moves at an appropriate time to operate the engine brake hydraulic system In some cases,an exhaust valve pushrod is selected while, in other cases, it is convenient to use the fuel injector pushrod. The problem of assigning a second function to an existing pushrod is that an increased load may be experienced which may exceed the design capacity of the pushrod or cam shaft. The present invention generally solves this problem by providing an automatic means a to unload the engine brake whenever an excessive loading condition becomes imminent and b to reactivate the engine brake Qs soon as the temporary excess loading condition has terminated so as not to interfere with the effectiveness of the engine brake. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION With the foregoing in mind, we provide in accordance with the invention an engine braking apparatus of a gas compression relief type including an internal combustion engine having exhaust valve means and pushrod means, hydraulically actuated piston means for opening said exhaust valve means at a predetermined time, and further piston means actuated by said pushrod means and hydraulical ly interconnected with said exhaust valve opening piston means in a high pressure hydraulic fluid circuit, characterized by a bi stable valve located in said high pressure hydraulic fluid circuit and having at least primary and secondary orifices, and damping means associated with said valve to rapidly damp out vibrations of said valve while it is moving from its closed position defining a high pressure condition, until it comes. to rest in an open position defining a low pressure condition, said primary and secondary orifices and damping means maximizing the flow through said valve and minimizing the time required to attain said low pressure condition. The apparatus of the invention will rapidly respond to a hydraulic pressure in the brake system above a desired predetermined pressure and maintain the system pressure for the balance of a cycle at a fraction of the predetermined pressure whenever an excess pressure is sensed. With our apparatus the pressure drop will occur rapidly and with a minimum number of pressure oscillations and the apparatus will automatically reset itself after operation so as to restore it to the regular operating mode.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Figure 1 is a schematic diagram of a compression relief engine brake adapted for use in conjunction with an internal combustion engine of the spark ignition or compression ignition type. As noted above, the basic design of the compression relief brake is disclosed in the Cummins U.S. Patent 3,220,392. For purposes of simplicity and clarity, the present invention will be described with reference to an engine brake applied to aCummins compression ignition engine in which the master piston of the engine brake is driven by the injector pushrod. It will be understood that the invention may also be applied to other applications where, for example, the master piston is driven by an exhaust valve pushrod. Moreover, as will be explained below, the pressure re lief device herein disclosed may be placed at any convenient point in the high pressure hydraulic circuit although its combination with the master piston is particularly desirable. Referring now to Figure 1, the numeral 10 represents a housing fitted on an internal combustion engine within which the components of a compression relief engine brake are contained. Oil 12 from a sump 14 which may be, for example, the engine crankcase is pumped through a duct 16 by a low pressure pump 18 to the inlet 20 of a solenoid valve 22 mounted in the house ing 10. Low pressure oil 12 is conducted from the solenoid valve 22 to a control cylinder 24 by a duct 26. A control valve 28 is fitted for reciprocating movement within the control cylinder and is urged into a closed position by a compression spring 3Q. The control valve 28 contains an inlet passage 32 closed by a ball check valve 34 which is biased into the closed position by a compression spring 36 and an outlet passage 38.When the control valve 28 is in the open position as shown in Figure 1 the outlet passage 38 registers with the control cylinder outlet duct 40 which communicates with the inlet of a slave cylinder 42 also formed in the housing. It will be understood that low pressure oil 12 passing through the solenoid valve 22 enters the control valve cylinder 24 and raises the control valve 28 to the open position. Thereafter, the ball check valve 34 opens against the bias of spring 36 to permit the oil 12 to flow into the slave cylinder 42 From the outlet 44 of the slave cylinder 42 the oil 12 flows through a duct 46 into the master cylinder 48 formed in the housing 10. A slave piston 50 is fitted for reciprocating motion within the slave cylinder 42. The slave piston 50 is biased in an upward direction as shown in Figure 1 against an adjustable stop 52 by a compression spring 54 which is mounted within the slave piston 50 and acts against a bracket 56 seated in the slave cylinder 42,The lower end of the slave piston 50 acts against an exhaust valve cap or crosshead 58 fitted on the stem of exhaust valve 60 which is, in turn, seated in the engine cylinder head 62.As exhaust valve spring 64 normally biases the exhaust valve 60 to the closed position as shown in Figure 1, Normally the adjustable stop 52 is set to provide a clearance of about 0fQ18 inch .i,e, lash between the slave piston 50 and the exhaust valve cap 58 when the exhaust valve 60 is closed, the slave piston 50 is seated against the adjustable stop 52 and the engine is cold.This clearance is required and is normally sufficient to accommodate expansion of the parts comprising the exhaust valve train when the engine is hot. without opening the exhaust valve 60. A master piston 66 is fitted for reciprocating movement within the master cylinder 48 and biased in an upward direction as viewed in Figure 1 by a light leaf spring 68, The lower end of the master piston 66 contacts an adjusting screw mechanism 70 of a rocker arm 72 controlled by a pushrod 74 driven from the engine camshaft not shown . As noted above, when applied to the Cummins engine, the rocker arm 72 is conveniently the fuel injector rocker arm and the pushrod 74 is the injector pushrod. In this circumstance, the pushrod 74 and the exhaust valve 60 are associated with the same engine cylinder, It will be understood that when the solenoid valve 22 is opened, oil 12 will raise the control valve 28 and then fill both the slave cylinder 42 and the master cylinder 48.Reverse flow of oil out of the slave cylinder 42 and master cylinder 48 is prevented by the action of the ball check valve 34. However, once the system is filled with oil, upward movement of the pushrod 74 will drive the master piston 66 upwardly and the hydraulic pressure, in turn, will drive the slave piston 50 downwardly to open the exhaust valve 60. The valve timing is selected so that the exhaust valve 6Q is opened near the end of the compression stroke of the cylinder with which exhaust valve 60 is associated.Thus, the work done by the engine piston in compressing air during the compression stroke is released to the exhaust and radiator systems of the engine and not recovered during the expansion stroke of the engine, When it is desired to deactivate the compresion brake, the solenoid valve 22 is closed whereby the oil 12 in the control valve cylinder 24 passes through the duct 26, the solenoid valve 22 and the return duct 76 to the sump 14. When the control valve 28 drops downy wardly as viewed in Figure 1, a portion of the oil in the slave cylinder 42 and master cylinder 48 is vented past the control valve 28 and returned to the sump 14 by duct means not shown , The electrical control system for the. engine brake includes the vehicle battery 78 which is grounded at 80.The hot terminal of the battery 78 is connected in series, to a fuse 82, a dash switch 84, a clutch switch 86, a fuel pump switch 88 and, preferably, through a diode 90 back to ground 80. The switches 84, 86 and 88 are provided to assure the safe operation of the system. Switch 84 is a manual control to deactivate the entire system. Switch 86 is an automatic switch connected to the clutch to deactivate the system whenever the clutch is disengaged so as to prevent engine stalling. Switch 88 is a second automatic switch connected to the fuel system to prevent engine fueling when the engine brake is in operation. Reference is now made to Figure 2 which shows in an enlarged cross sectional view one form of a modified master piston in accordance with the present invention.The master piston 66 comprises a hollow cylindrical body 92 open at the top and having a plurality of drainage passageways 94 communicating between the interior and exterior of the body 92. A cap 96 is threaded into the top of the body 92 and contains adjusting bores 98 adapted to receive an appropriate wrench or spanner not shown A central or primary orifice 100 is formed in the cap 96 and communicates with a larger valve bore or secondary orifice 102.The intersection of the orifice 100 and the valve bore 102 defines a valve seat 104 for a valve 106, preferably in the form of a spheroid or ball, but which may also, for example, be conical in shape The diameter of the valve 106 is selected so as to be slightly smaller than the bore 102 while the cap 96 has a thickness such that the bottom surface 108 lies slightly below the center of the valve 106, A spring 110 mounted within the body 92 of the master piston 66 carries a valve guide 112 which biases the valve 106 against the valve seat 104, The valve guide includes a seat portion 114 and a plunger portion 116 designed to limit the downward motion of the valve guide 112 before the spring 110 becomes fully compressed. In operation, it will be understood that the pressure in the high pressure side of the engine brake hydraulic system which includes the slave cylinder 42 and the master cylinder 48 will be transmitted through the master piston 66 and will appear as a force tending to compress or buckle the pushrod 74. In addition, the force required to operate the fuel injector will be carried as a force moment by the rocker arm 72 and then reflected as a compressive or buckling force on the pushrod. However, the hydraulic pressure alone will act on the valve 106 over an area defined by the orifice 100 to produce a force tending to open the valve. If the force due to the hydraulic pressure exceeds the force due to the spring 110, the valve 106 will be displaced slightly from the seat 104 whereupon the hydraulic pressure will act on the full projected cross section of the valve 106, an area known as the secondary area.As a result, the valve 106 will be rapidly accelerated to the fully displaced position as limited by contact between the plunger end 116 of the valve guide 112 with the bottom of the piston body 92. Applicants have found that in order to cause the pressure to be dumped rapidly with a minimum of pressure oscillation it is desirable accurately to define the ratio of the annular area between the inside of the piston body 92 and the outer periphery of the shoulder portion 118 and the area of the orifice 100, The annular area may be called the 1tertiary area as distinguished from the primary area of the orifice 100 and the secondary projected area of the valve 106, Applicants have discovered that the ratio of the tertiary and primary areas should be at leas t 1.0 and preferably about 1,5.Where the ratio is less than 1,0 a throttling of the flow of hydraulic fluid occurs which tends to decrease the rate at which hydraulic fluid is dumped through the piston, When the area between the shoulder 118 of the valve guide 112 and the inner wall of the master piston 92, the tertiarytt area, is controlled so as to be between about 100 and 150 of the size of the orifice 100, the resistance to the flow of hydraulic fluid is sufficient so that the pressure acts on the upper surface of the valve guide 112 and quickly damps out the vibratory motion of the valve guide 112 and the valve 106 resulting from the reaction of the spring 110. As a result, the average opening and the average time in the open position of the valve 106 are increased whereby the flow through the valve is maximized.Tests have shown that when the ratio of the tertiary and primary areas exceeds about 150 the damping effect on the normal vibratory motion of the valve 106 and the valve guide 112 is diminished and when the area ratio is below 100 secondary throttling occurs which also restricts the flow of hydraulic fluid through the piston 66, In addition, applicants believe that the effect of locating the bottom 108 of the cap 98 below the maxi mum diameter of the valve 106 is that the valve 106, whenfully contained in the valve bore 102, allows a pressure to develop behind the valve 1Q6 in the valve bore 102 and this causes a greater acceleration and increased velocity of the valve.The effect is that the valve is open for a longer time and the average opening is greater whereby the flow through the ball valve is maximized. It will be understood that while a relatively high hydraulic pressure is required initially to unseat the valve 106, a much smaller pressure is required to maintain the valve in the open position. The ratio of these pressures is approximately equal to the inverse ratio of the area of the orifice 100, the primary area, and the cross sectional area of the valve 106, the secondary area,The total area of the drainage passageways 94 should be greater than the area of the orifice 100 and the opening between the valve 106 and the bore 102 to insure that the drainage passageway 94 do not throttle the flow of hydraulic fluid. It will therefore be appreciated that whenever the valve 106 opens, it will remain open in a stable condition until a sufficient quantity of hydraulic fluid has been dumped so as to establish a low pressure level in the hydraulic system.The pressure at which the valve 106 will begin to open is controlled by the bias exerted by the spring 110 which acts through the valve guide 112 to hold the valve 106 against the seat 104. Such bias may be regulated by adjusting the cap 96 until the desired load on the spring 110 is attained. Once adjusted, the cap 96 may be staked or otherwise locked in the body 92 of the master piston 66 to maintain the adjustinent, It will be understood, that after the hydraulic pressure in the high pressure system has been relieved, the valve 106 will automatically reseat and the hydraulic system will be restored to its normal operating mode, Thus, the engine brake will again be in condition to operate. Referring now to Figure 3, another form of a pressure relief valve is shown. Parts which are common to both Figures2 and 3 bear the same identification. The principal difference in construction lies in the structure of the valve guide 122 of Figure 1 which comprises a as symmetric structure having a radially extending shoulder portion 124, an axially extending plunger 125 and a skew seat 127. By the term skew seat , applicants mean that the plane of the seat in the valve guide 122 against which the valve 106 acts is not normal or perpendicular to the axis of the guide 122 but, instead, is inclined with respect to that axis as is clearly shown in Figure 3.In this case the valve 106 should be a ball valve, If the force due to hydraulic pressure exceeds the force due to the spring 110, the ball 106 will be displaced slightly from the seat 104 whereupon the hydraulic pressure will act upon the full projected cross section of the ball valve 106. As a result, the ball valve 106 will be rapidly accelerated to the fully displaced position and will tend to ride down the skew seat 127.The resulting skew movement of the ball valve 106 in combination with the impact of the plunger 125 against the bottom of the piston body 92 tends quickly to damp out vibrations and inhibit the ball valve 106 from reseating itself before the hydraulic pressure has been fully dissipated by the flow of hydraulic fluid through the piston body 92 and then through the drainage passageways 94, As in the case of the structure shown in Figure 2, the bottom edge 108 of the cap 96 extends slightly below the center of the ball 106 whereby a pressure of hydraulic fluid tends to be built up in the valve bore 102 which accelerates the ball 106 to a high velocity whereby the ball valve is opened more rapidly to maximize the flow of hydraulic fluid therethrough, Reference is now made to Figure 4 in which pushrod force is plotted against engine crank position in terms of the crank angle before and after top dead center TDC . Curve A represents the force required at the injector pushrod to open an exhaust valve, This is the force transmited through the high pressure hydraulic system of the engine brake by the slave piston 50 and the master piston 66. Curve A is in the form of a bell curve essentially symmetric about the TDC point and reflects the changing pressure within the cylinder. Curve A may be displaced vertically depending upon the degree of boost given by the engine supercharger. In Figure 4, curve A is shown with a typical normal boost of 15 inches of mercury. If a higher boost were used, the curve would be raised while with a lower boost it would be lowered. Curve B represents the force induced in the pushrod to open the exhaust valve and hold it open.Until the clearance or lash in the system is taken up, essentially no force is induced in the pushrod. However, once the clearances are taken up, the force in the pushrod builds rapidly until the exhaust valve begins to open. Once the exhaust valve begins to open as a result of the coincidence of Curves B and A at point 126 Figure 4 , Curve B will peak and then drop to a low level determined essentially by the force exerted by the exhaust valve spring 64. Curve C represents the force induced in the pushrod due to the operation of the fuel injector train.This force normally peaks shortly after TDC and the peak, indicated at point 128, represents the crushing load on the injector train as the injector is mechanically seated in the injector body. The maximum force occurs at point 128 and is considered in the normal design of the engine. Curve D represents the total force on the pushrod due to the combined effect of the exhaust valve opening load and the injector load and is determined as the sum of the forces shown by Curves B and C. In general, it will be noted that Curve D will have two peaks the first occurring approximately when the exhaust valve begins to open and the second when the injector seats, These peaks áre indicated, respectively, at points 130 and 132, It will be appreciated that if the time interval between the peak loads indicated by points 130 and 132 is decreased for any reason, such as excessive lash in the system or increased supercharger boost, for example, the force required to open the exhaust valve may not have decreased to its minimum value before the maximum injector load occurs with the result that the total load on the injector pushrod becomes excessive and buckling of the pushrod may occur. Figure 5 illustrates a typical operation of the present invention wherein the engine brake hydraulic system is unloaded to prevent damage to the injector pushrods when an overload condition occurs as a result of excessive supercharger boost. Curve A is identical to Curve A of Figure 4 and represents a normal 15 inch supercharger boost while Curve E indicates the maximum boost capable of being provided by the engine supercharger,Curve C is also identical to Curve C of Figure 4 and represents the force on the injector pushrod due to the injector load alone. The line 134 represents the set point for the pressure relief system of the present invention This is the predetermined pressure within the hydraulic system of the engine brake at which the valve 106 will be displaced from its seat 104 so as to dump hydraulic fluid through the master piston 66 and therefore unload the system.Curve B in Figure 5 represents the force in the pushrod due tothe hydraulic pressure in the engine brake mechanism and the exhaust valve train, It is similar to Curve B of Figure 4 but, because of the increased supercharger boost, the curve reaches the set point 134 before it coincides with the boost curve E,As a result, the exhaust valve will not be opened, Instead, the pressure in the hydraulic system will be dumped to a lower stable level determined by the characteristics of the specific pressure relief system employed as described above in connection with Figures 2 and 3.The total force on the pushrod is therefore shown by the curve D which, while necessarily in excess of the Curve C, is still within the designed capacity of the pushrods, It will be understood that the set point 134 is selected in combination with the relative dimensions of the valve 106 and its bi stable setting such that the resultant force on the pushrods does not exceed a safe load. From a consideration of Figure 5, it is apparent that not only must the stable force on the pushrods be limited, but the fugitive oscillations in this force should be dissipated before the injector load becomes operative.Applicants have discovered that rapid damping of these force oscillations can be accomplished by the special designs of the pressure relief systems disclosed herein. InFigure 3, the skewed seat 127 prevents the ball valve 108 from reseating prematurely as a result of such fugitive oscillations. Similarly, a control of the ratio of the area of the clearance space between the shoulder 118 and the piston body 92 and the area of the orifice 100 as shown in Figure 2 is also effective to prevent premature reseating of the valve 106. Figure 6 is a graph showing the effect of the variations in the size of the fluid flow passages of the configuration of Figure 2 on the performance of the pressure relief system. For the tests represented by Figure 6, a pressure relief system of the type shown in Figure 2 was employed wherein the area of the orifice 100 the primary area was 0.0102 square inches. Curve 136 shows the performance of a pressure relief system wherein the area between the inner surface of the master piston body 92 and the shoulder 118 of the valve guide 112 the tertiary area was 0.0676 square inches while Curve 138 shows the improved performance resulting from a decrease in the size of the orifice between the shoulder 118 and the inner sur face of the master piston body 92 the tertiary area to 0.0146 square inches.Curve C of Figure 6 is identical to Curve C of figures 4 and 5 and is reproduced for reference in the following discussion. Figure 6 shows two improvements which result from the change exemplified byCurve 138 First, the pressure maintained in the system after TDC was substantially lower and, second, the time measured in crank angle degrees required to dump the pressure, was substantially decreased. Both effects are important The first reduces the total maximum load on the injector pushrod while the second tends to separate the effect of the peak load required to open the exhaust valve from the injector seating load. Applicants believe that when the area between the shoulder 118 of the valve guide 112 and the inner wall of the master piston 92, the tertiary area, is controlled so as to be between about 100 and 150 of the size of the orifice 100, the resistance to the flow of hydraulic fluid is sufficient so that the pressure acts on the upper surface of the valve guide 112 and quickly damps out the vibratory motion of the valve guide 112 and the valve 106 resulting from the reaction of the spring 110. As a result, the average opening and the average time in the open position of the valve 106 are increased whereby the flow through the valve 106 is maximized.Tests have shown that when the ratio of the tertiary and primary areas exceeds about 150 the damping effect on the normal vibratory motion of the valve 1Q6 and the valve guide 112 is diminished and when the area ratio is below 100 secondary throttling occurs which also restricts the flow of hydraulic fluid through the piston 66. Applicants believe that a similar damping phenomena occurs in the pressure relief system shown in Figure 3 although in that case it is believed that t he damping is a result of mechanical contact between the seat 127, the ball 106 and the lower edge 1Q8 of the cap 96. By incorporating the pressure relief system into the master piston as shown in Figures 2 and 3, applicants provide a convenient mechanism whereby existing compression relief engine brakes may be retrofitted to gain the advantages of the present system at minimum cost.It will also be noted that the hydraulic fluid which is vented from the system is returned to the system without the need for additional ducts or pumps since it is de livered to the pushrod area, an area where hydraulic fluid is normally present. However, the pressure relief system herein contemplated may be placed at any point in the high pressure hydraulic fluid circuit, for example, in ducts 40 or 46. While in such locations the dimensional limita tions presented by the master piston 66 are not present, hydraulic fluid return ducts would be required. It will be understood that if the pressure relief system of the present invention were placed elsewhere in the high pressure circuit, the body 92 or its equivalent would be threaded or otherwise connected to the high pressure circuit and the drainage passageways would be connected to a hydraulic fluid return duct. In such a system, it is apparent that either the three area pressure relief valve as shown in Figure 2 or the equivalent two area and skew seat pressure relief valve of Figure 3 could be employed.However, because of the elimination of the dimensional constraints, determined by the shape and size of the master piston in such a modification, the coil spring 110 and the valve guide 122 of Figure 3 may be combined in the form of an equivalent leaf spring having a ball engaging surface of the shape and orientation of the ball guide seat 127 and a spring rate equal to that of the coil spring 110. Such a modification would operate in a manner similar to the pressure relief system of Figure 3, as described herebefore but, as also noted, could be located at any convenient point in the high pressure hydraulic system. The terms and expressions which have been employed are used as terms of description and not of limitation and there is no intention in the use of such terms and expressions of excluding any equivalents of the features shown and described or portions thereof, but it is recognized that various modifications are possible within the scope of the invention claimed,
