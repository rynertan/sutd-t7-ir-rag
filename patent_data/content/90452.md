# Process for producing steel in a converter from pig iron and ferrous scrap.

## Abstract
A process of producing steel in a converter, wherein the starting materials comprise pig iron and ferrous scrap, involves blowing of oxygen into the molten metal bath in the converter. Advantageous results, in particular savings of Fe and Mn and in the amount of liquid metal used, are obtained by the combi nation of the following process steps a during at least part of the time of blowing oxygen into the bath, inert gas is passed through the bottom of converter into the bath, b during at least part of the time of blowing oxygen into the bath, secondary oxygen is blown into the atmosphere above the bath, c at least once during the time of blowing oxygen into the bath, carbon is added to the reaction from above.
