# Stripline antennas.

## Abstract
A length of microstrip line 3 turns through successive right angle corners to form a rectangular pattern comprising successive quartets a,b,c,d of such corners. Each right angle corner radiates with a polarisation which is predominantly diagonal, and the strip lengths 8,9 between the corners of each quartet are made such, in relation to the operating wavelength in the strip, that the radiation from each quartet sums to produce a desired polarisation direction, e.g. vertical, horizontal, or circular of either hand. Some forms of the stripline antenna can be used in a resonant as well as a travelling wave mode, the latter giving a main lobe whose direction sweeps with frequency.
