# Magnetic bend segment for a chain conveyor.

## Abstract
A bend segment for a chain conveyor, including a chain movable over a track including one or more bends. The chain is composed of interconnected links 4 of magnetizable material having a substantially rectangular load bearing surface. The bend segment 1 3 is an integral element, U shaped in cross section, with an under surface formed with elongate pockets, extending into the legs 2, 3 of the element and extending in the longitudinal direction of the bend segment. The pockets are arranged to receive magnets 7 provided to keep the chain flat in a bend of the track. The under surface of the element is provided with means 8 10 for confining the magnets in the pockets.
