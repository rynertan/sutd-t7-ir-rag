## Description
Method for Manufacturing an Object of Soft MagneticMaterial by Bonding Together a Mass of Powder GrainsThe invention relates to a method for manufacturing an ob ject of soft magnetic material by bonding together a mass of powder grains according to the introductory part of claim 1.Proposals have been made for replacing magnetic cores of laminated sheet metal for stators in electrical machines by magnetic cores manufactured from powder. The latter magnetic cores are manufactured from powder the grains of which consist of a soft magnetic material with a high sa duration magnetization, such as pure iron or silicon contanning iron, for example iron containing 3 silicon, by bonding together the powder grains by a resinous binder under the application of heat and pressure.It is known that powder cores for high frequency applications can be manufactured by providing powder grains of a soft magnetic material with a coating of a ceramic binder and by then pressing the powder grains into an object which is subsequently subjected to a heat treatment. When pressing magnetic cores of powder grains intended to replace magnetic cores of laminated sheet metal, problems arise in obtaining at the same time the necessary property values with respect to eddy current losses, magnetizability, hysteresis losses and mechanical strength.The invention aims at developing a method of the above mentioned kind which allows to manufacture objects from powder of iron based soft magnetic material, which combine high magnetizability and high mechanical strength with low eddy current losses and low hysteresis losses.In order to achieve this aim the invention suggests a method according to the preamble of claim 1 which is charaoterized by the features of the characterizing part of claim 1.Further particulars of the method according to the invention are characterized by the features of the subsequent claiins. A feasible explanation of the results obtained according to the invention may be the following Through the chemical bond of the iron oxide or the reaction product of the iron oxide and other oxides to the powder grain material, the coating on the grains is well anchored to said powder grain material, which contributes to a good mechanical strength of the finished object. Because the coating is at least relatively resistent to deformations at higher temperatures but still has a certain flexibility in thin layers so that it can be adapted to changes of the shape of the grains of the iron bases material during pressing, and because the pressing is carried out as an isostatic pressing, the coating can be brought to form, in the finished object, thin layers of uniform thickness thus giving the object a compact structure.The electrically insulating character of the layers results in both low eddy current losses and good magnetizability of the finished object. Further, owing to the fact that the pressing can be carried out at relatively high temperatures, internal stresses which may occur in the grain material may be removed, which results in low hysteresis losses of the finished object. If, however, the temperature during the pressing becomes too high, such as 0 above 900 C, no reduction is obtained, in any case no con siderable reduction, of the eddy current losses.compared with those of solid iron based material of the same kind, which is probably due to metallic contacts then easily arising between the grains.The grains of the iron based material may consist of at least approximately pure iron, preferably containing at least 99.95, Fe. Here, and in the following, the symbol relates to percentage by weight. The grains may also consist of iron containing silicon, aluminium, and or titanium. The content of silicon may suitably amount to 0.01 8 , the content of aluminium to 0.001 2, and the content of titanium to 0.001 1 . Regardless of the type of ironbased material, the carbon content should be below 0.005, . At least the main part of the grains of the iron based material suitably has a size of 50 1000 um and the coating suitably a thickness of 0.01 0.51um, The layers formed by the coatings between two adjacent grains have, on an average a thickness of 0.02 1 yzn, The ratio between the average thickness of said layers and the average grain size of the iron based material is preferably between the limits to 10 2 The iron oxide on the grains can advantageously be accomplished by oxidation of the powder grains in a fluidized bed reactor with water vapour or air at a temperature of around 4000C.If the iron based material consists of pure iron, at least an oxide of silicon, aluminium or titanium is supplied to the surface of the oxidized grains to form the coating. This can be performed from a colloidal solution of the oxide in question with water. The oxide can also be supplied otherwise. The ilicon oxide, for example, may be supplied by coating the oxidized grains with a hydrolyzable organic silicon compound, such as tetraethyl silicate, which is then hydrolyzed while forming a silicon dioxide.The amount of suppli oxide shall be sufficient to form with the iron oxide during a subsequent heat treatment, suitably at a temperature of above 8000C in inert atmosphere, either in connection with the isostatic pressing or in a separate stage prior thereto a silicate, aluminate and or a titanate, which is active as a binder in the pressed object. Also if the iron based material consists of iron containing silicon, aluminium or iron, the described method of supplying oxides of silicon, aluminium and or titanium from outside can be employed.IS the ironbased material is of the latter kind, however, the silicon, aluminium and or titanium included in the iron based material can be utilized to form the silicate, aluminate and or titanate with the iron oxide formed during the previously mentioned oxidation of the grains. The formation of silicate, aluminate and or titanate takes place at elevated temperature, suitably at above 8000,C, and suitably in an atmosphere of moist hydrogen gas. During said heat treatment, silicon, aluminium and or titanium in the ironbased material reacts with the iron oxide present at the surface of the grains to form silicon dioxide, aluminium trioxide and or titanium dioxide, whereby the iron oxide is reduced to iron. The primarily formed oxide of the kind mentioned further reacts with iron oxide remaining at the surface of the grains thereby forming silicate, aluminate and or titanate. This can take place either in a separate.stage prior to the iso static pressing or in conjunction with the iso static pressing. If the content of silicon, aluminium and or titanium in the ironbased material is sufficient to form a sufficient amount of silicate, aluminate and or titanate, no oxide of these substances need be supplied from outside. If the content is insufficient, a supplementary amount of oxide may be subsequently supplied, such as described in connection with the supply of such oxide to oxidized grains of pure iron, where this supply is necessary.The iso static pressing is suitably carried out at a temperature of 600 9000C, preferably at a temperature of 600 7750C, and suitably at a pressure of 10 200 MPa, preferably at a pressure of at least 50 MPa.The invention will now be explained in greater detail by describing some examples with reference to the accompanying figure, which schematically shows the structure of the material in an object manufactured according the the invention,The figure shows the structure of part of an object built .up of grains 1 of an iron based soft magnetic material, which are bonded to each other by means of a binder 2 formed of coatings on the individual grains.Examples of such coatings are described in the following Example 1 Substantially spherical grains of approximately pure iron containing 99,99 Fe and less than 0.005 C and having a size of 45 2004am are oxidized at a temperature of 4000C in water vapour so that the grains receive a coating of iron oxide having a thickness of about 0.01 Am, which takes less than 1 minute.The oxidized grains are dipped into a colloidal solution of silicon dioxide in water and are then dried, thus receiving a coating of silicon dioxide having a thickness of 0.04 cm. The grains are then placed in a capsule of steel sheet having low carbon content and having the same shape as, but larger dimensions than, the object which is to be manufactured. The capsule with its contents is evacuated and sealed. It is thereafter placed sun a high pressure furnace where it is heated to 7000C before being subjected to a pressure of 100 MPa by an inert gas such as argon. The temperature is then raised to 750 0C while maintaining the pressure.When the grain material has been subjected to the pressure at this temperature for two hours, the capsule with its contents is allowed to cool and the capsule is removed. Thereby the oxides in the coating react to form silicate. The object obtained during the isostatic pressing forms a coherent body with a densitiy exceeding 99 of the theoretical density and with a good mechanical strength.Instead of silicon dioxide there may be used aluminium oxide or titanium dioxide preferably in the form of anatase or a mixture of at least two of these oxides to obtain the described coating on the grain covered with iron oxide.Example 2Substantially spherical grains of silicon steel containing 3 Si and less than 0.005 C and having a grain size of 150 350ylm are oxidized in water vapour at a temperature of around 4000 so that the grains receive a coating of iron oxide having a thickness of about 0.1 Am. The oxidized grains are then treated at a temperature of around 825 0C in moist nitroger gas for a few minutes so that a silicate, formed in a manner previously described, is obtained at the surface of the grains. The grains are thereafter placed in a capsule of steel sheet with a low carbon content and having the same shape as, but larger dimensions than, the object to be manufactured. The capsule with its contents is subjected to the same treatment as the filled capsule described under Example 1.The object obtained during the isostatic pressing forms a coherent body with the silicate as a binder between the grains. It has a density exceeding 99 , of the theorectical density and a good mechanical strength. Instead of using d steel containing 3 Si there may be used a steel containing 0.2 aluminiumEMI6.1 EMI7.1 or a steel containing 0.01 Ti or a steel containing at least two of said substances in said contents.The manufactured object may, among other things, be used as a magnetic core, preferably as a stator, for an electrical machine or as a magnetic core for a magnetically operated contactor. It may also constitute part of a magnetic core, for example for a stator for an electrical machine. A magnetic core for a large stator can then be manufactured in a number of parts which are arranged adjacent to each other in order to form the magnetic core.
