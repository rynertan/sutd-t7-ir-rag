# Heat storage medium.

## Abstract
A heat storage medium consists of sodium hydroxide and water, the sodium hydroxide concentration being in the range greater than the stoichiometric concentration in sodium hydroxide monohydrate up to and including 80 by weight, the water concentration being in the range less than the said stoichiometric concentration down to and including 20 by weight. Within this particular concentration range the tendency of the sodium hydroxide water system to supercool diminishes after a few cycles. The initial supercooling may be reduced by the addition of tellurium dioxide in amount 0.1 to 2.0 by weight of the combined weight of sodium hydroxide and water.
