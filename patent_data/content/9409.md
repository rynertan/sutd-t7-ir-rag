# Cathode ray tube arc over protection.

## Abstract
A high voltage terminal 25 of an ultor capacitance 40 of a cathode ray tube 21 is coupled to an electron gun structure 26 . The low voltage terminal A , which typically comprises a point on an outer conductive coating 24 on the cathode ray tube envelope 22 is coupled to a ground terminal 37 of a spark gap X X . The ground termination for electrical components and the chassis 36 is also coupled to the group terminal of the spark gap X X . During arc over, the cathode ray tube ultor capacitance discharges through the spark gap X X . Arc over current oscillations flow in the chassis and electrical component circuitry by means of stray capacitive coupling. Current damping means such as a resistor Ri is coupled between the chassis 36 and the low voltage terminal A for damping arc over current oscillation in the chassis and in the component circuitry. The current damp ing means Ri may be of such value as to integrate the voltage across stray capacitance at the frequencies of arc over currents.
