# Chemically coupled color changing display.

## Abstract
A display matrix having a plurality of distinct, electronic ally isolated elements of a solid, insoluble display material capable of reversibly changing color by reaction with soluble reactants is disposed spaced apart from drive matrix means capable of being addressed by direct multiplex addressing. An addressed display element receives the reactants by diffusion through an electrolyte from an associated region in the drive matrix.
