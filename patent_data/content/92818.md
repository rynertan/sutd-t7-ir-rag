# Method for grinding the surface of a semiconductor wafer.

## Abstract
A dresser made of bonded alundum type abrasive is ground by a rotating blade made of bonded super abrasive to dress the blade. The surface of a semiconductor wafer is ground by the rotating dressed blade to convert it into a matte finished surface substantially free from saw marks.
