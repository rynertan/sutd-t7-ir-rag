# Substituted bicyclo 2,2,1 heptanes and bicyclo 2,2,1 hept 2 enes and their pharmaceutical compositions.

## Abstract
Novel bicyclo 2,2,1 heptanes and hept 2Z enes are sub stituted at the 5 position by a 6 carboxyhex 2 enyl group or a modification thereof, and at the 6 position by an aldoxime or ketoxime group which is O substituted by an aliphatic hyd rocarbon residue, an aromatic residue, or an aliphatic hyd rocarbon residue substituted directly or through an oxygen or sulphur atom by an aromatic residue. Such compounds may be prepared by the action of an oximating agent on an inter mediate which is substituted at the 6 position by an aldehydic or ketonic carbonyl group. The compounds are of value for use in pharmaceutical compositions particularly in the con text of the inhibition of thromboxane activity.
