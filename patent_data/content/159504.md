# Fuel injection apparatus employing electric power converter.

## Abstract
Fuel injection apparatus including a power converter for generating a stable, high voltage DC signal for powering the fuel injectors. The power converter is connected to a voltage source such as a vehicle battery. The power con verter includes a DC DC converter and a feedback stabilized converter control circuit. The converter control circuit adjusts the operation of the DC DC converter in a direction to counteract changes in output voltage caused by battery voltage variations. The high voltage DC signal is applied to each injector through one or more solid state switches. Since the signal used to power the fuel injectors is substantially constant regardless of normal battery volt age variations, the injector pull in time is substantially constant. Moreover, the use of a high voltage power signal enables low current injectors to be used. The low injector current results in low power dissipation by the solid state switches which operate the injectors. The output voltage generated by the converter is also used to bootstrap the power signal applied to the converter control circuit.
