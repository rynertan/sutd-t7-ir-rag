## Description
The present invention relates generally to a thin film solar module and, more particularly, to a method and structure for interconnecting cells by a plurality of discrete conductive regions extending between each pair of cells to be interconnected. Thin film solar cells generate current at voltages far below those required in most consumer applications. Thus, it is desirable to produce a large number of such cells in a single monolithic module and connect them in series so that the overall output voltage is the sum of the cell voltages. A number of prior techniques for interconnecting monolithic solar cells have made use of continuous stripes of conductive material disposed along edges of the cells, as described in Kim U.S. A 4 428 110, Biter U.S. A 4 042 418 and Swartz GB A 2 095 908. Mention may also be made of GB A 2 108 755 which discloses a thin film device having the pre characterising features of claim 1. Another form of interconnection is disclosed in Morel U.S. Patent No. 4,517,403, which describes a primary embodiment having conductive stripes or stitch bars on transparent front contact pads. Unlike the stripes of the Kim, Biter and Swartz patents, the stitch bars of the Morel application are not necessarily continuous. The Morel technique also makes use of the localized application of heat to the area of the stitch bars to increase conductivity. If a laser of sufficiently high energy is used to apply heat, the back contact and the semiconductive layer beneath it are cut along a continuous line, leaving a conductive residue which connects the cells together. However, such a cut isolates one half of the conductive residue from the bulk of the corresponding back contact pad, taking that portion of the residue out of the series circuit of the module. A continuous cut is also undesirable for process related reasons because the laser used to produce it must emit pulses rapidly as the workpiece moves. This requires a rather sophisticated laser and may limit the processing speed. Finally, continuous cutting operations produce a significant amount of debris which can be a problem in cell manufacture. Therefore, it is desirable to provide an improved method of interconnecting monolithic solar cells which is rapid, effective and produces a minimum of debris. According to the present invention from one aspect, there is provided a thin film solar module comprising According to the present invention from another aspect, there is provided a method of fabricating a thin film solar module, comprising In a preferred embodiment, the localized conductive regions are established by applying discrete, spaced apart laser pulses to the areas of electrode overlap. The pulses render the material along the paths more conductive and may vapourise parts of the second electrode pads and the semiconductive layer so that holes or cavities extend partially through the module. When cavities are created, the material around them is heated as well. The material closest to a cavity is heated to a very high temperature and the more distant material is heated to progressively lower temperatures, so that material at some radius from the cavity is heated to temperatures within a range which causes it to become conductive. Thus, a substantially annular conductive region is produced around each cavity to interconnect the cells. In another preferred embodiment, each first electrode pad is made up of a transparent conductive film portion and a metal containing portion in electrical contact therewith, such that the discrete conductive regions extend from each second electrode pad to the metal containing portion of the first electrode pad that it overlaps. The above embodiments relax processing constraints while providing a sufficiently conductive interconnecting path along the edges of cells. When using a laser, the speed of the workpiece relative to the laser can be increased without increasing the rate of laser pulses, permitting the laser to operate in a range within which it produces identical, well defined pulses. When the laser removes material at discrete locations, the process yields less debris than a continuous cut. It can also produce more conductive material for interconnection because the cavities created by the laser are surrounded by substantially annular conductive regions, as opposed to a pair of opposed conductive walls. The entire circumference of each annular region is connected to the major portion of the upper contact and is useful for interconnection. The present invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which FIGURE 1 illustrates a monolithic thin film solar module 10 constructed according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The module has a plurality of elongate solar cells 12 connected electrically in series between a pair of external leads 14. The cells are shaped as narrow strips and are connected together along opposite longitudinal edges thereof to minimize series resistance losses. Connection is accomplished by a large number of discrete conductive regions extending directly through an unpatterned active layer of the module. The conductive regions can be produced by applying conductive material discontinuously near an edge of each cell before the active layer is deposited, by heating the cells to a preselected temperature at a plurality of spaced locations, by a composite method in which conductive material is applied and the cell are heated at spaced locations, or by a somewhat different method in which discrete holes or cavities are formed in the active layer and subsequently provided with conductive material. In each case, current generated by the cells in response to incident light hv travels a short distance along each cell electrode before passing by way of the discrete conductive regions to an opposite electrode of an adjacent cell. Referring to FIGURE 2, the solar panel 10 has a continuous semiconductive layer 16 on a transparent substrate 18. The semiconductive layer 16 is contacted at a lower surface thereof by a plurality of first front electrode pads 20 and at an upper surface by a plurality of second back electrode pads 22. Each back electrode pad 22 overlies a portion of one of the front electrode pads 20 at a photovoltaic region 24 of the semiconductive layer, forming one of the cells 12 of the module. Each back electrode pad 22 also overlaps the front electrode pad 20 of an adjacent cell over a preselected area 26. Interconnection is made by a plurality of discrete conductive regions 28 or 30 which extend through the semiconductive layer at locations spaced apart from each other along imaginary lines or courses 32. In the preferred embodiment, the front electrode pads 20 are transparent conductive pads having metal containing interconnect portions or stitch bars 34 at the areas of overlap. The concept and structure of the interconnect portions 34 are described in the above referenced U.S. A 4 517 403. According to that disclosure, an effective short circuit is provided between each front electrode and the back electrode that overlaps it, causing the voltage at the front of each cell to be applied to the back of an adjacent cell to form at least one series connected string of cells. In a large module, a number of series connected strings may be connected in parallel to produce desired output voltage and current characteristics. The interconnect portions 34 are deposited before the thin film semiconductive layer 16 and are preferably tall and rough in comparison to it, causing the semiconductive layer to have localized regions near the interconnect portions which are relatively thin and have a low dielectric standoff. The interconnect portions preferably have the same height and other characteristics as described in the above referenced U.S. A 4 517 403. With an appropriate choice of materials and dimensions of the interconnect portions 34 and the back contact pads 22, the structure yields conductive regions sufficient to interconnect cells. In such a case, the interconnect portions 34 will typically be discontinuous along the courses 32 to produce the discrete conductive regions 28 or 30. If the relative height and roughness of the interconnect portions 34 are not great enough to provide reliable connection between cells, the semiconductive layer can be rendered more conductive at the regions 28 or 30 by the local application of heat. The interconnect portions 34 may then be either continuous or discontinuous, and may be very thin as long as sufficient material is present to make contact to the front electrode pads. A critical consideration of the module 10 is that the total conductance of the interconnects be sufficient to pass current produced by the cells without adding appreciably to series resistance. The conductance is, of course, dependent on the spacing between conductive regions. In different applications the spacing may vary from a minimum at which the conductive regions nearly touch to a maximum comparable to the width of the strip cells 12. Some of the parameters relevant to the spacing of conductive regions are the same as those determining maximum cell width, i.e., sheet resistance and general module design criteria. In most cases, the conductive regions are spaced apart between approximately 10 µm and 100 µm. The local application of heat is preferably accomplished by directing laser pulses 35 onto the areas of the interconnect portions 34 at locations spaced apart sufficiently to produce discrete conductive regions approximately 25 µm in diameter. The conductive regions may be heated to a temperature which causes diffusion into or crystallization of the semiconductive layer without disrupting the integrity of the layer, or may be heated to a point at which the material vapourizes to produce a hole or cavity 36 down to the stitch bar 34. The generally Gaussian intensity profile of laser pulses causes the material irradiated by the center of a pulse to be heated to a higher temperature than that irradiated by its fringe. As long as a pulse has at least a preselected threshold energy, the energy imparted by the laser will be just enough at some point within the module to enhance conduction without adversely affecting the properties of the material. The point of enhanced conduction can be at the center of the pulse or spaced from it, depending upon the pulse energy. When material is vapourized or otherwise removed by the laser, the surrounding material is also heated, and conductive material is dispersed through the thickness of the layers. This produces a substantially annular region of relatively high conductivity which contains both the back contact material and the semiconductive material. The conductive region can be located along the interior wall of the cavity 36 or outwardly therefrom, depending upon the energy of the laser and the materials used. The stitch bars and the electrode pads are preferably arranged so that the point of interconnection is within the area 26 of electrode overlap and is spaced inwardly from the parallel edges of the overlapping pads. This assures reliable interconnection of cells without shorting either cell. As described in the above referenced US A 4 517 403 of the transparent substrate 18 is preferably a glass substrate coated with a thin transparent conductive layer 20 for use as the front electrode of the cell. The glass and the transparent conductor are chosen to be compatible with one another, with the transparent conductor chosen to minimize losses due to absorption and series resistance. The interconnect portions 34 are preferably applied as parallel lines over the transparent conductive film and the film is scribed alongside the interconnect portions to yield a series of discrete front electrode pads 20 separated by spacings 38, each electrode pad having an interconnect portion adjacent to one edge thereof. The interconnect portions 34 may be deposited by suitable thin film techniques, such as evaporation through a mask, or by screen printing. In the case of screen printing, the interconnect portions are applied as a screen printable paste containing metallic powder, glass frit and a suitable organic vehicle or binder. The paste is subsequently cured at elevated temperatures to leave conductive material having a significant metallic content. The semiconductive layer 16 is preferably thin film silicon hydrogen based material having layers of different conductivity type which form a rectifying junction. In the preferred embodiment, a The back electrode pads 22 are applied over the semiconductive layer 16, with the electrode pads 22 offset slightly from the pads 20 so that they overlap along the areas 26 which contain the interconnect portions 34. The back electrode may contain any suitable material able to form an ohmic contact with the The thickness of the layers of the module 10 are subject to modification but typically fall within known ranges. For example, the semiconductive layer 16 is preferably between 3.0 x 10 ⁷ and 6.0 x 10 ⁷ metres 3,000 and 6,000 angstroms in total thickness and the transparent conductor should be between 5.0 x 10 ⁸ and 1.0 x 10 ⁶ metres 500 and 10,000 angstroms thick. The thickness of the back electrode pads 22 is less critical than that of the semiconductive layer or the transparent conductive contact. It can vary upwardly from a minimum of a few hundred x 10 ¹⁰ metres angstroms , as long as adequate conductivity is obtained. When the back contact is screen printed, it may be 25 µm or more in thickness. The energy of the laser used to interconnect cells typically falls within a window of suitable values lower than the energy required to pattern the transparent conductive film of the front electrode pad 20. This relationship is shown graphically in FIGURE 4, wherein laser pulses having energies within the range 40 will pattern the oxide film of the front electrodes 20 without damaging the glass substrate 18, and pulses within the range 42 will produce conductive regions 28 or 30 without damaging the oxide film. The ranges 40 and 42 may be mutually exclusive, yielding different optimum energy ranges 44 and 46 for carrying out the two processes. In any case, the required laser energies and pulse repetition rates will depend on the materials and thicknesses of the layers encountered. It will be understood from the foregoing that an important function of the interconnect portions 34 is to provide a base material for connection of the front electrode pads. The need for such a base is particularly acute when the front electrodes contain transparent conductive oxides. The base material may be a conductive metal containing composition, as described above, or may be in the nature of a flux which is not itself conductive but acts on the transparent conductive layer to enhance the quality of the contact. FIGURE 3 illustrates a solar module 10 which is constructed according to another embodiment of the present invention and does not make use of the predeposited interconnect portions 34. Photovoltaic regions 24 of a semiconductive layer 16 are sandwiched between offset front and back electrode pads 20 and 22 , respectively. Specifically, the front electrode pads are deposited as a continuous layer of transparent conductive material onto a transparent substrate 18 and scribed along parallel lines to form gaps 38 . The semiconductive layer 16 is applied over the front electrode pads 20 and the substrate between the pads, and is more uniform than the corresponding layer of the module 10 because the interconnect portions 34 are not used. A conductive film 48, preferably at least a few thousand x 10 ¹⁰ metres angstroms thick, is applied over the semiconductive layer 16 . A series of holes or cavities 36 are formed in the semiconductive layer 16 and the conductive film 48 at locations near one edge of each front electrode pad, after which a second conductive film 50 is applied. The material of the film 50 covers the film 48 and enters the cavities 36 to form conductive regions 52 which connect the front electrode pads to the conductive film 48 at the locations of the cavities. As a result, the conductive film 50 has a series of depressions 54 coinciding with the cavities 36 . The conductive films 48 and 50 are patterned to separate them into the back electrode pads 22 each of which overlies a corresponding photovoltaic region 24 and is connected to the front electrode pad of an adjacent cell 12 by the conductive regions 52. In effect, the regions 52 serve as conductive rivets connecting the front and back electrode pads at the areas of electrode overlap. In the module 10 , the annular conductive regions resulting from the process of forming the cavities 36 are not relied upon alone for interconnection. Instead, the cavities serve primarily to provide access to the front electrode pads 20 so that subsequently applied conductive material will interconnect the cells. Alternatively, the conductive regions 52 might be formed by introducing a plurality of separate conductive rivet like elements through uninterrupted portions of the semiconductive layer at the areas of electrode overlap. Such a process would eliminate the need for preforming the cavities 36 . The cavities 36 are formed by localized heating, such as laser heating with a source similar to that used to form the conductive regions 28 and 30 of the module 10 FIGURE 2 . However, the considerations governing the composition of the back electrode pads 22 are different than those governing the composition of the back electrode pads of the module 10 because the material of the back electrode pads 22 must make contact directly to the transparent conductive material of the front electrode pads 20 . Whereas aluminum can be used as the back electrode of the module 10, aluminum alone is not suitable for use in the module 10 because it does not make stable contact to some transparent conductive oxides. When deposited over tin oxide, for example, aluminum forms an oxide of its own which insulates it at the point of contact. Thus, it is desirable in the embodiment of FIGURE 3 to use a back electrode material which makes ohmic contact with oxides. However, such a material cannot be placed directly over the semiconductive layer 16 because it would then contact any peaks of the transparent conductive oxide which protrude through the semiconductive layer, shorting out the cells. In the preferred embodiment of FIGURE 3, the film 48 of the back electrode pads 22 contains aluminum or a similar material which makes good contact to silicon based semiconductors, and the film 50 contains a material such as nickel, titanium or chromium which makes good electrical contact to oxides. The first layer contacts the semiconductive layer 16 without shorting to any oxide peaks, and the second layer makes good contact to the oxide through the cavities 36 . Although laser pulses are described above as being directed onto the backs of the modules 10 and 10 to produce the discrete conductive interconnect regions of the invention, they can be applied in the opposite direction through the transparent substrate, if desired, particularly for the module 10 . When applied in this manner, the pulses pass through the substrate and the front electrode pads before being absorbed by the semiconductive layers. The laser energy vaporizes the semiconductive material at the locations of heating, blasting the back electrode material off the cell to leave the cavities 36 or 36 . This geometry has the advantage that the debris produced in forming the cavities does not redeposit onto other active portions of the module. It also enables the use of lower laser powers because the energy is absorbed more efficiently by the semiconductive material assessible from the front of the module than it is by the metallic back electrode. It will be understood that a variety of other heating techniques can be used to interconnect cells without deviating from the teachings of the present invention. Such techniques include the localized application of an electron beam, high voltage electric discharge, and radiant heat. In each case, heat produces discrete conductive interconnect regions which are discontinuous within each cell. In operation, the solar panels 10 and 10 are arranged to receive light hv through the transparent substrate and the front electrode pads. Light absorbed by the photovoltaic material generates an electrical current for collection by the front and back electrodes of the cells. The voltage at the front electrode of each cell is applied to the back electrode of an adjacent cell by a plurality of discrete conductive regions, thereby connecting the cells in series. Thus, the voltage across the leads 14 represents the sum of the voltages of the solar cells 12. Monolithic solar modules have been made according to both disclosed embodiments of the present invention with good results. The modules were fabricated as series connected strip cells on substrates of glass 30 centimeters by 30 centimeters in size. The glass was purchased with a tin oxide TO coating having a sheet resistivity of approximately 20 ohms per square and a light transmission in the solar spectrum of about 80 percent. In the case of the module 10, the TO layer was printed with an array of parallel stitch bars 34 using a commercial silver paste. The sample was then fired at 550 degrees Celsius, leaving continuous stitch bars approximately 25 µm high and 200 µm wide. A laser was used to scribe the TO along a line beside each stitch bar, forming groove like spaces 38 about 25 µm wide which separated the TO layer into a plurality of front electrode pads. An additional laser scribe at the periphery of the substrate isolated the cells from any TO extending beyond a preselected area. The substrate was then subjected to a glow discharge deposition in silane to produce a The conductive regions 30 were formed by directing pulsed laser beam onto the back electrode pads at the areas of the interconnect portions 34 as the module moved. The module was moved rapidly enough so that the conductive regions were discrete from one another. The laser was an Nd YAG laser, Q switched, having a nominal power rating of 30 watts and a wave length of 1.06 µm. The module was moved at approximately 203.2 x 10 ³ metres 8 inches per second with a pulse rate of approximately 5 kilohertz. This compares to a pulse rate of approximately 15 kilohertz for continuously scribing the transparent front contact with the same laser and at the same table speed. Under the conditions described above, the laser produced a plurality of separate cavities 36 extending through each back electrode pad 22, the semiconductive layer 16 beneath the pad, and possibly the metallic interconnect portion 34. As the cavities were formed, annular regions around them were heated to temperatures sufficient to produce conductive combinations of the metallic and semiconductive components of the module. While not bound by any theory, it is believed that the increase in conductivity of the modules fabricated in this way resulted largely from dispersal of the metallic material of the interconnect portions 34 along the interior walls of the cavities 36. The cavities were approximately 25 µm in diameter and were spaced a few micrometers apart. In the context of the present invention, the cavities may be spread anywhere from a fraction of 1 µm to a few centimeters apart, depending upon the conductance required for cell performance. The modules produced according to the embodiment 10 of FIGURE 3 were formed by a process similar in many respects to the process of the module 10, but different in that the interconnect portions 34 were omitted, the back electrode pads 22 were different in composition, and the cavities 36 were formed before the final conductive film 50 was applied. The first conductive film, 48 of the back electrode pads 22 was a vacuum deposited aluminium layer approximately 8 x 10 ⁷ metres 8,000 angstroms thick which contacted the semiconductive layer 16 without shorting to peaks of the transparent conductive oxide layer. This film and the semiconductive layer 16 were subjected to a series of pulses from the laser described above to form the cavities 36 along the areas of electrode overlap. The second conductive film 50 was a vacuum deposited nickel layer at least a few hundred nanometres angstroms thick which entered the cavities 36 to produce the discrete rivet like conductive regions 52 through the semiconductive layer. An inorganic maskant was screen printed onto the semiconductive layer 16 for patterning purposes prior to the conductive films 48 and 50. The maskant and the back electrode material over it was later removed by a solvent wash step, leaving a well defined set of back electrode pads. From the above, it can be seen that there has been provided a photovoltaic device and related method of formation wherein a plurality of cells of a monolithic thin film solar panel are connected in series through a plurality of discrete conductive regions extending through the photoactive film. The discontinuous nature of the conductive regions within each cell relaxes certain constraints, such as minimum laser pulse rate, and permits greater processing rates for a given laser. Each conductive region need not be perfect, as long as the aggregate of all such regions provides the necessary conductance between cells. When material is removed in this manner, the amount of debris is less than in the continuous scribing case because less material is removed. The annular conductive areas of the interconnecting dots can also be greater than the area provided by a single scribed line. It should be noted that, although as described above, the modules 10 and 10 are deposited using the transparent sheet 18 as a substrate, they can be deposited equally well on an opaque substrate so that light enters the module through an upper transparent surface.
