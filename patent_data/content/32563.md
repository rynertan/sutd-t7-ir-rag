# A process for increasing the lithium content obtained from lithium solutions using lithium aluminates resin composites.

## Abstract
Improvements are made in the process wherein Li values are recovered from dilute aqueous solution by the use of an anion exchange resin composite C 1, C 2, C 3 , containing crystalline LiX 2Al OH â‚ƒ, where X is ha lide. The improvements derive from enriching the Li con taining solution with a non competing metal salt e.g., NaCl S 1, S 2 prior to the Li removal, thereby achieving higher Li loading of the resin composite and obtaining more concentrated eluates. The non competing metal salts that can be used are the chlorides, bromides or iodides of the alkali and alkaline earth metals.
