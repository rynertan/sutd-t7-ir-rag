# A COLD ELECTRIC BURNER

## Abstract
A cold electric burner or a ceramics hob which heats conductive food and or a conductive pan through hysterisis loss and or eddy current loss by exciting a coil with high frequency power, comprises a casing, a coil mounted on a coil support, and an insulation cover plate between said coil and food to be cooked. Said coil support is made of ferro magnetic material of a mixture of insulation resin and ferrite powder which occupies 75 85 weight , instead of a prior mere insulation resin so that no flux leaks below the coil support. Preferably, the coil support has a plurality of longitudinal ferrite ribs extending radially under said coil support, and still more preferably, the coil support has a plurality of holes at the central portion of the same so that permeability at the central portion is essentially smaller than that at the outer portion to provide uniform flux.
