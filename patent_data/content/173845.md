## Abstract
A circular connector 20 for a plug type connection 22 to a mating connector 21 which uses complementary locking means 2, 3, 4, 5 that are engaged and disengaged by rotation. Helical locking grooves 4, 4 are provided which have a bayonet detent space 51 extending in an axial direction and an adjacent detent space 5, 5 extending in the peripheral direction. The detent space 5, 5 is defined by limiting means 2, 2 . Complementary noses 7, 7 on the mating connector 21 are movable by rotation along the grooves 4, 4 into the detent spaces 5, 5 to lock the connectors.
