# Method and apparatus for thruster transient control.

## Abstract
Transients and steady state error induced in maneuver ing a satellite due to a disturbance torque caused by thrust mismatch or differential in the alignment of thrusters with respect to the center of mass are minimized by introducing a torque balancing bias at the input of a thrust modulator of the thrusters 18, 20 prior to sensing position or attitude er ror. The bias may instantly off modulate the thruster control signal to cancel the effects of attitude transients before er rors develop. Other axes thrusters 22, 24, 11, 18 may be on modulated instantaneously to compensate for cross axis torque. The bias may be introduced into the satellite control scheme by manual ground control or in automatic on board compensation based on stored parameters ob tained for example from calibration measurements. Specifi cally, the torque balancing bias may be developed by refer ence to thrust mismatch detected and stored during pre vious maneuvers, thus anticipating expected attitude error without actual detection thereof.
