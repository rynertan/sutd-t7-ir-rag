# CONTROL OF PARTICLE SIZE DISTRIBUTION DURING CONTINUOUS HEAT SETTING OF MEAT ANALOG

## Abstract
A process for controlling the particle size distribution of wet, agglomerated meat analog during continuous heat setting of the protein is disclosed. The improvement in the continuous heat setting, preferably by continuous frying, of textured protein comprises feeding the wet agglomerate to the heat source, e.g. a fryer, as a continuous layer of constant bulk density and thickness. The agglomerate is placed on a continuous belt within the heating unit via a feed belt. The particle size distribution of the wet analog and thus the heat set analog is controlled by the ratio of the continuous heat setting unit belt to the feed belt speeds.
