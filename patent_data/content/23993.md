# Face type shaft seal for liquid metal pumps.

## Abstract
A liquid metal pump comprises a seal 20 in which the opposed seal faces 34 50 are gold plated and designed so that the liquid metal wets the seal faces and creates a thin layer of liquid metal between the two seal faces during both rotation of the pump shaft 26 and non rotation of the pump shaft. A thin layer of liquid metal which is retained between the faces as a result of the gold plating prevents contact of the two seal faces during initial rotation of the pump shaft.
