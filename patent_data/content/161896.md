# HALF WAVE DEMODULATION CIRCUIT

## Abstract
An electronic circuit for converting an AC voltage input signal to a DC voltage output signal utilises a square wave reference signal 31 for regulating a field effect transistor 38 to switch on the input signal 30 for a half period, and to switch off the input signal for a half period, whereby ripple current flows through a first filter 43, 45, 47 coupled to the transistor for only a half period, with a steady discharge current through the first filter for the other half period,, thereby reducing ripple. A second filter 46, 49 coupled to the first filter 43, 45, 47 and an operational amplifier 51 further diminish ripple.
