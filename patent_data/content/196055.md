## Description
This invention relates to an insoluble and infusible substrate with a polyacen type skeletal structure having open pores continuous pores that are not closed , an electrically conductive organic polymeric material obtained by doping the aforesaid substrate with a doping agent, and to an organic cell comprising the aforesaid material as an electrode and a solution in an aprotic organic solvent of a compound capable of forming dopable ions as an electrolytic solution. Polymeric materials have excellent moldability, light weight and mass producibility. Hence, organic polymeric materials having electrical semiconductivity obtained by making use of these properties of polymeric materials have been demanded in many industrial fields, most frequently by the electronics industry. Early organic semiconductors were difficult to mold into a film or plate, and had only limited applications because they did not have the properties of a n type or p type impurity semiconductor. In recent years, organic semiconductors having relatively superior moldability have been developed. These semiconductors can be converted to n type or p type organic semiconductors by doping them with electron donating or accepting dopants. A typical example of such an organic semiconductor is polyacetylene. This organic semiconductor has an electrical conductivity of about 10 ⁵ ohm cm ¹, but its electrical conductivity can be greatly increased by doping it with an electron accepting dopant such as I₂ or AsF₅, or an electron donating dopant such as Li or Na, and electrical conductivities of 10² to 10³ ohm cm ¹ have been obtained with polyacetylene. Polyacetylene, however, lacks practical utility as an industrial material because it is susceptible to oxidation by oxygen and is difficult to handle in the air. European Patent No. 0067444 corresponding to USSN 386816 and Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication No. 136,649 1983 filed by the same applicants as the present ones discloses an electrically conductive organic polymeric material comprising A an insoluble and infusible substrate having a polyacen type skeletal structure with a hydrogen carbon atomic ratio of from 0.60 to 0.15 which is a heat treated product of an aromatic condensation polymer composed of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen and B an electron donating doping agent or an electron accepting doping agent, said material having a higher electrical conductivity than the undoped substrate. This insoluble and infusible substrate has excellent heat resistance and oxidation resistance, and can be doped with the electron donating or accepting doping agent to give an organic semiconductor showing p type or n type properties. This European Patent, however, fails to give any description of a porous substrate or a porous organic semiconductor material. European Laid Open Patent Application No. 0149497 corresponding to USSN 690799 filed by the same applicants as the present ones discloses an electrically conductive organic polymeric material comprising A an insoluble and infusible substrate with a polyacen type skeletal structure having a hydrogen carbon atomic ratio of from 0.60 to 0.15 and a specific surface area, measured by the BET method, of at least 600 m² g, B an electron donating or accepting doping agent, said material having a higher electrical conductivity than the substrate. Since the specific surface area of this organic polymeric material is at least 600 m² g, it can be doped smoothly even with a dopant having a relatively large ion radius, such as C10₄ or BF₄ . The specification of this prior application fails to describe anything on a porous substrate or a porous organic semiconductor. EP A 0 175 373 discloses an insoluble and infusible substrate with a polyacen type skeletal structure having a hydrogen carbon atomic ratio of from 0.05 to 0.6 and a specific surface area, measured by the BET method, of at least 600 m² g. This substrate is a heat treated product of a mixture comprising an aromatic condensation polymer consisting of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen as a matrix and a fiber member. This fiber member is selected from the group consisting of phenol resin fibers, heat treated phenol resin fibers and carbon fibers. This document does not disclose a porous substrate. EP A 147 494 this document was published after the priority dates of the present application and US A 4 464 485 disclose a method for producing a porous material having open pores in the range of 0.5 to 10 µm. A slurry is prepared from a mixture comprising a bisphenol type epoxy resin, a specific mixture amide compound as a hardener, a filler and water. The slurry is cast in a water impermeable mold and hardened while it contains the water. The hardened body is then dehydrated. A large amount of the filler is used which is bound by the bisphenol type epoxy resin. This document does not disclose to prepare a substrate having a polyacen type skeleton structure. In recent years, there has been an increased tendency toward the reduction of the size, thickness and weight of electronic devices, and this has led to the need to reduce the size, thickness and weight of a cell constituting a power supply for the electronic devices. Nowadays, silver oxide cells find extensive use as a small sized electric cell having high performance, and furthermore, lithium cells have been developed and come into commercial acceptance as a dry cell of a small thickness or a small sized light weight high performance cell. Since, however, these cells are primary cells, they cannot be used for long periods of time by repeating charging and discharging. On the other hand, nickel and cadmium cells have been commercially used as a secondary cell of high performance, but have been found to be unsatisfactory in regard to the reduction of size, thickness and weight. Lead batteries have long been used in various industrial fields as secondary cells of a large capacity, but suffer from the defect of having large weight. This cannot be avoided since they use lead peroxide and lead as electrodes. Attempts have recently been made to reduce the size of these batteries and improve their performance in order to use them as cells for electric automobiles, but have not proved to be commercially successful. There is still a strong demand for secondary cells having a large capacity and light weight. As stated above, the cells now in commercial use have their own advantages and disadvantages, and are used selectively according to the intended uses. There has, however, been a strong need for the reduction of the size, thickness or weight of the cells. As a cell meeting such a need, a cell has recently been studied and proposed in which a thin film like polyacetylene, i.e. an organic semiconductor, doped with an electron donating or accepting substance is used as an electrode active substance. This cell is a secondary cell having high performance and has a possibility of being reduced in thickness and weight. But it has the serious dedfect that polyacetylene is a very unstable substance which is easily oxidized by oxygen in air or thermally degenerated. Accordingly, an electric cell from this material must be produced in an inert gaseous atmosphere. In addition, there is a restriction on the production of polyacetylene in a form suitable as electrodes. Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication No. 35881 1983 proposes an electrochemical cell comprising carbon fibers having a specific area of 1,000 to 10,000 m² g as at least one of its electrodes. The specification of this Publication shows that the carbon fibers have a diameter of 10 to 20 micrometers, and are formed into a sheet or the like for use as an electrode. It is an object of this invention to provide a porous organic semiconductor. Another object of this invention is to provide a porous organic semiconductor having excellent heat resistance and oxidation resistance. Still another object of this invention is to provide an organic semiconductor containing many open pores, which can be rapidly and uniformly doped with an electron accepting dopant and or an electron donating dopant. Yet another object of this invention is to provide an organic semiconductor containing many open pores, which can be rapidly and uniformly doped with an electron accepting dopant and or an electron donating dopant having a relatively large ion radius. European Laid Open Patent Application No. 0149497 proposes an organic electrolytic cell comprising an insoluble and infusible substrate with a polyacen type skeletal structure which is a heat treated product of an aromatic condensation polymer composed of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen and has a hydrogen carbon atomic ratio of 0.05 to 0.5 and a specific surface area, measured by the BET method, of at least 600 m² g as a positive electrode and or a negative electrode, and a solution in an aprotic organic solvent of a compound capable of forming dopable ions in the electrode by electrolysis as an electrolyte solution. This cell is a secondary cell having a possibility of extensive application because it has high performance, can be reduced in thickness and weight and is easy to mold and the electrode active substance has high oxidation stability. Some problems, however, are still left in making this cell commercially acceptable. The most important problem is to increase the capacity of the cell, or in other words, to increase the amount of doping and increase the energy density that can be taken out. A further object of this invention is to provide an organic semiconductor doped with an electron donating dopant and or an electron accepting dopant. A further objct of this invention is to provide a porous organic semiconductor in the form of a film, a plate, etc. A further object of this invention is to provide an organic semiconductor having fine open cells which easily permits various chemical reactions or physical adsorption. A further object of this invention is to provide an organic electrolytic cell. A further object of this invention is to provide an organic electrolytic cell having a large capacity per unit weight and a high energy density. A further object of this invention is to provide an organic electrolytic cell comprising as an electrode active substance an organic semiconductor composed of an insoluble and infusible substrate with a polyacen type skeletal structure. A further object of this invention is to provide an economical organic electrolytic secondary cell which can be reduced in size, thickness and weight and is easy to produce. A further object of this invention is to provide a secondary cell which has a high electromotive force and a low internal resistance and can be charged and discharged over a long period of time. Additional objects of this invention along with its advantages will become apparent from the following description. According to the present invention, these objects and advantages are achieved firstly by an insoluble and infusible substrate with a polyacen type skeletal structure having a hydrogen carbon atomic ratio of from 0.05 to 0.60 and open pores having an average diameter of 0.03 to 10 micrometers, said substrate being a heat treated product of an aromatic condensation polymer consisting of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, said aromatic condensation polymer being selected from the group consisting of 1 a condensation product of an aromatic hydrocarbon compounds having a phenolic hydroxyl group with an aldehyde, and 2 a condensation product of a mixture of an aromatic hydrocarbon compound having a phenolic hydroxyl group and an aromatic hydrocarbon compound free of phenolic hydroxyl group with an aldehydes, wherein said heat treated product shows a three dimensional network structure of open pores. According to the present invention, the above objects and advantages are achieved secondly by an electrically conductive organic polymeric material comprising a an insoluble and infusible substrate with a polyacen type skeletal structure as mentioned above, and b an electron donating doping agent, or an electron accepting doping agent, or both said material having a higher electrical conductivity than the non doped substrate a . According to the present invention, the above objects and advantages are achieved thirdly by an organic cell comprising a positive electrode, a negative electrode and an electrolytic solution, one or both of said positive and negative electrodes being composed of an insoluble and infusible substrate with a polyacen type skeletal structure having a hydrogen carbon atomic ratio of from 0.05 to 0.50, a specific surface area, measured by the BET method, of at least 600 m² g and containing open pores having an average diameter of 0.03 to 10 micrometers, said substrate being a heat treated product as stated above, and said electrolytic solution being a solution in an aprotic organic solvent of a compound capable of forming ions which can dope said electrode by electrolysis. An organic semi conductor, which is a heated material of a phenolic resin or a furan resin, is disclosed in JP A 58 69 234. It is mentioned that the presence of open pores having a diameter of more than 0.012 micrometers in the organic semi conductor is undesirable. Open pores forming a three dimensional network structure are not disclosed. JP A 58 209 864 discloses to use an organic semi conductor, which is a heated material of an aromatic condensation polymer comprising carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, as a positive electrode and or a negative electrode. Nothing is disclosed as to the effect that an organic semi conductor has open pores which form a three dimensional network structure. In the accompanying drawings In each of these micrographs, the thick line shown at right bottom measures 5 micrometers. The aromatic condensation polymer used in this invention is a condensation product between an aromatic hydrocarbon compound having a phenolic hydroxyl group and an aldehyde. Examples of suitable aromatic hydrocarbon compounds are phenols such as phenol, cresol and xylenol, but are not limited to these. For example, they may be methylene bis phenols represented by the following formula wherein x and y, independently from each other, represent 0, 1 or 2, The aromatic condensation polymer used in this invention may also be a modified aromatic polymer from a aromatic hydrocarbon compound having a phenolic hydroxyl group partly replaced by an aromatic hydrocarbon compound having no phenolic hydroxyl group such as xylene and toluene, and an aldehyde, such as a condensation product of phenol, xylene and formaldehyde. Examples of the aldehyde are formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and furfural. Formaldehyde is preferred. The phenol formaldehyde condensate may be a novolak, or a resol, or a composition of both. The insoluble and infusible substrate of this invention is a heat treated product of the aromatic condensation polymer described above, and can be produced, for example, in the following manner. A precondensate between an aromatic hydrocarbon compound having a phenolic hydroxyl group with or without an aromatic hydrocarbon compound having no phenolic hydroxyl group and an aldehyde is prepared, and an aqueous solution of the precondensate and an inorganic salt is formed. The aqueous solution is poured into a suitable mold, and heated while inhibiting evaporation of water, whereby it is cured and converted into such a form as a film or a cylindrical article. The cured article is then washed to remove the inorganic salt contained in it. The resultant porous cured condensate is heated to 400 to 800 C in a non oxidizing atmosphere. The inorgnaic salt used together with the precondensate is a pore forming agent to form open pores in the cured article and is removed in a later step. Examples of the inorganic salt are zinc chloride, sodium phosphate, potassium hydroxide and potassium sulfide. Of these, zinc chloride is especially preferred. The inorganic salt is used in an amount 2.5 to 10 times the weight of the precondensate. If its amount is less than the lower limit, it is difficult to obtain a porous cured article having open pores. If, on the other hand, it is larger than the upper limit, the heat treated product finally obtained undesirably tends to have a reduced mechanical strength. The aqueous solution of the precondensate and the inorganic salt can be prepared by using water in an amount 0.1 to 1 times the weight of the inorganic salt. The aqueous solution having a viscosity of 100,000 to 100 poises is poured into a suitable mold, and heated to a temperature of, for example 50 to 200 C. It is important that during the heat treatment, evaporation of water in the aqueous solution should be inhibited. It is thought that the precondensate undergoes heating in the aqueous solution and gradually cures and grows to a three dimensional network structure while separating from the inorganic salt and water. The inorganic salt can be removed from the cured product by washing it fully with water, dilute hydrochloric acid, etc. After the removal of the inorganic salt, the cured product is dried to give a porous cured condensate in which open pores are developed. Since the porous cured condensate is of the three dimensional network structure in the resin portion or open cells therein, it contains open pores into and out of which a fluid is permitted to flow easily. The pores have an average pore diameter of as small as 0.03 to 10 micrometers. The porous condensate has a uniform diameter and a sharp pore diameter distribution. By properly selecting the composition of an aqueous solution of an uncured phenolic resin containing an inorganic salt and the heat curing conditions, it is possible to obtain porous articles of varying pore diameters ranging from a very fine porous article having an average pore diameter of from 0.03 to 0.1 micrometer to a porous article having an average pore diameter of about 10 micrometers. Such articles, therefore, can be used in various fields, for example, as filters for separating relatively large particles, separators for electric cells, and separation of bacteria or colloidal particles. The porous cured condensate obtained has an apparent density of 0.3 to 0.7 g cm³. The resulting porous cured condensate is then heated in a non oxidizing atmosphere including a vacuum to a temperature of 400 to 800 C, preferably 450 to 750 C, especially preferably 500 to 700 C. The preferred rate of temperature elevation during the heat treatment slightly differs depending upon the type of the aromatic condensation polymer, its shape, the degree of the curing treatment, etc. Generally, the temperature can be elevated from room temperature to about 300 C at a relatively large rate, for example 100 C hour. At temperatures above 300 C, the thermal decomposition of the aromatic condensation polymer begins to evolve gases such as steam H₂O , hydrogen, methane and carbon monoxide, and therefore, the temperature is advantageously elevated at a sufficiently slow rate. The heat treatment of the aromatic condensation polymer is carried out in a non oxidizing atmosphere. The non oxidizing atmosphere is, for example, nitrogen, argon, helium, neon or carbon dioxide. Nitrogen is preferably used. Such a non oxidising atmosphere may be stationary or fluidized. The above heat treatment consequently gives an insoluble and infusible substrate with a polyacen type skeletal structure having a hydrogen carbon atomic ratio to be referred to as H C ratio of from 0.6 to 0.05 and containing open pores having an average pore diameter of 0.03 to 10 micrometers. The porous cured condensate and the insoluble and infusible substrate can be used, for example, as a separating material or an adsorbent material because they are porous and have heat resistance, chemical resistance and corrosion resistance. Alternatively, a porous heat treated product having developed open pores and a high specific surface area can be obtained by preparing a porous cured condensate by the aforesaid method, heating the cured product in a non oxidizing atmosphere including a vacuum to a temperature of 350 to 800 C, preferably 350 to 700 C, especially preferably 400 to 600 C, thereafter washing the heat treated product fully with water, dilute hydrochloric acid, etc. to remove the inorganic salt in it, and then drying the product. This product is an insoluble and infusible substrate with a polyacen type skeletal structure having a hydrogen carbon atomic ratio of from 0.6 to 0.05 and a specific surface area of at least 600 m² g and containing open pores having an average pore diameter of 0.03 to 10 micrometers. The insoluble and infusible substrate of this invention has an H C ratio of preferably from 0.5 to 0.05, more preferably from 0.6 to 0.15 and contains open pores with an average pore diameter of 0.03 to 10 micrometers. The insoluble and infusible substrate of this invention usually has an oxygen carbon atomic ratio O C ratio of not more than 0.06, preferably not more than 0.03. X ray diffraction CuK It is seen therefore that in the above insoluble and infusible substrate, the polynuclear structure of the polyacen type benzene is uniformly and moderately developed between polyacen type molecules. According to this invention, there is also provided as porous organic semiconductor by doping the above insoluble and infusible substrate with an electron donating dopant, or an electron accepting dopant, or both. Specifically, according to this invention, there is provided a porous organic semiconductor comprising A substance which easily liberates an electron is used as the electron donating dopant. Examples of preferred electron donating dopants are metals of Group IA of the periodic table such as sodium, potassium, rubidium and cesium. Tetra C₁ C₄ alkyl ammonium cations such as CH₃ ₄N or C₄H₉ ₄N may also be used as the electron donating dopant. On the other hand, a substance which easily accepts an electron is used as the electron accepting dopant. Examples of preferred electron accepting dopants include halogens such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine halogen compounds such as AsF₅, PF₅, BF₃, BCl₃, BBr₃ and FeCl₃ oxides of non metallic elements such as SO₃ and N₂O₅ and anions derived from inorganic acids such as H₂SO₄, HNO₃ and HClO₄. Doping with the dopants may be carried out by substantially the same method as the doping methods previously used for polyacetylene and polyphenylene. For example, when the dopant is an alkali metal, the substrate may be doped by bringing it into contact with a molten mass or a vapor of the alkali metal. Alternatively, the doping may be carried out by contacting the insoluble and infusible substrate with an alkali metal naphthalene complex formed in tetrahydrofuran. When the dopant is a halogen, a halogen compound or a non metallic element oxide, the insoluble and infusible substrate may be easily doped by contacting it with a gas of such a dopant. When the dopant is an anion derived from an inorganic acid, the doping may be carried out by directly coating or impregnating the inorganic acid on or in the insoluble and infusible substrate. Alternatively, it is possible to install the insoluble and infusible substrate as an electrode, and electrochemically dope it with an electron donating dopant such as lithium or sodium or an electron accepting dopant such as ClO₄ or BF₄ . Since the insoluble and infusible substrate is a porous material having open pores, it has the excellent advantage that it permits easy diffusion of such a gaseous dopant or a dopant in solution therethrough, and can be doped rapidly and uniformly. The organic semiconductor of the invention so obtained has a higher electrical conductivity than that for example, 10 ¹² to 10² ohm ¹.cm ¹ of the undoped insoluble and infusible substrate. For example, it is several times to 10¹⁰ times higher. Upon doping, the electron donating dopant gives an n type semiconductor, and the electron accepting dopant, a p type semiconductor. According to this invention, it is also possible to use the electron donating dopant and the electron accepting dopant together. When these dopants are present mixed nearly uniformly in the porous organic semiconductor of this invention, the semiconductor is either of a p type or an n type by dint of either of these dopants which is present in a larger amount. For example, when the electron donating dopant is present in a larger amount, the semiconductor is of the n type, and when the electron accepting dopant is present in a larger amount, the semiconductor is of the p type. The organic cell provided by this invention uses the resulting insoluble and infusible substrate with a polyacen type skeletal structure having a hydrogen carbon atomic ratio of from 0.05 to 0.50 and a specific surface area, measured by the BET method, of at least 600 m² g and containing open pores with an average pore diameter of 0.03 to 10µm as at least one of the electrodes. The organic electrolytic cell of this invention is an organic secondary cell comprising the aforesaid porous insoluble and infusible substrate as a positive electrode and or a negative electrode and a solution in an aprotic organic solvent of a compound which upon electrolysis can form ions capable of being doped in the electrode as an electrolytic solution. The compound which can form ions dopable in the electrode may, for example, be a halide, a perchlorate, a hexafluorophosphate, a hexafluoroarsenate or a tetrafluoroborate of an alkali metal or tetraalkylammonium. Specific examples include LiI, NaI, NH₄, LiClO₄, LiAsF₆, LiBF₄, KPF₆, NaPF₆, n C₄H₉ ₄NClO₄, C₂H₅ ₄NClO₄, C₂H₅ ₄NBF₄, n C₄H₉ ₄NBF₄, n C₄H₉ ₄NAsF₆, n C₄H₉ ₄NPF₆ and LiHF₂. To dissolve the above compounds, aprotic organic solvents are used. Examples of the solvents include ethylene carbonate, propylene carbonate, gamma butyrolactone, dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, acetonitrile, dimethoxyethane, tetrahydrofuran. methylene chloride, sulfolane and mixtures of these. A solvent for a given compound used as the electrolyte is selected by considering the solubility of the electrolytic compound, the performance of the resulting cell, etc. In order to minimize the internal resistance of the cell by the electrolytic solution, the concentration of the above compound in the electrolytic solution is desirably at least 0.1 mole liter, and preferably 0.2 to 1.5 moles liter in usual cases. The cell action of the cell of this invention makes use of the electrochemical doping of the dopant into the insoluble and infusible substrate used as the electrode and its electrochemical undoping. In other words, energy is stored by the electrochemical doping of the dopant in the insoluble and infusible substrate, or is released outside by electrochemical undoping. Thus, the energy is taken outside or stored inside as an electrical energy. The cell of this invention is of two types. A first type is a cell in which both the positive and negative electrodes are composed of the porous insoluble and infusible substrate. A second type is a cell in which the positive electrode is composed of the porous insoluble and infusible substrate and the negative electrode is composed of an alkali metal or an alkaline earth metal. Examples of the alkali and alkaline earth metals are cesium, rubidium, potassium, sodium, lithium, barium, strontium, and calcium. Of these, lithium is most preferred. These metals may be used singly or as an alloy. The shape and size of the electrode composed of the insoluble and infusible substrate to be arranged within the cell can be selected depending upon the type of the desired cell. Since the cell reaction is an electrochemical reaction on the surface of the electrode, it is advantageous to maximize the surface area of the electrode. The insoluble and infusible substrate or the insoluble and infusible substrate doped with a dopant may be used as a current collector for taking out an electric current out of the cell from the substrate, but other electrically conductive substances having resistance to corrosion by the doping agent and the electrolyte solution, such as carbon, platinum, nickel and stainless steel, may also be used. Now, some embodiments of the cell of this invention will be described below with reference to Figure 3 showing the basic structure of the cell of this invention. The first type cell of this invention comprising the insoluble and infusible substrates as both the positive and negative electrodes will first be described. In Figure 3, a positive electrode 1 is made of the insoluble and infusible substrate in a film or plate form, and a negative electrode 2 is likewise made of the insoluble and infusible substrate in a film or plate form. These electrodes may, or may not, be doped with dopants. After building the cell, an electric voltage is applied from an exterior power supply to dope the electrodes with the dopant. For example, when both of the electrodes are made of the undoped insoluble and infusible substrate, the voltage of the cell after building is 0 V. By applying voltage from an external power supply and thereby doping both electrodes with the dopant, the cell attains an electromotive force. The cell has current collectors 3,3 for taking out current outside from the electrodes or supplying current for electrochemical doping, i.e. charging. The current collectors 3,3 are connected to the electrodes and esternal terminals 7,7 in a manner not to cause a drop in voltage. The cell further includes an electrolytic solution 4 composed of a solution in an aprotic organic solvent of the aforesaid compound capable of forming ions dopable into the positive and negative electrodes. Usualy, the electrolytic solution is liquid, but to prevent leakage, it may be used as a gel or solid. The cell further comprises a separator 5 for preventing contact between the positive and negative electrodes and holding the elecrolytic solution. The separator 5 is made of a porous material which has durability against the electrolytic solution, the doping agent, or an electrode active substance such as an alkali metal, contains open pores, and is free from electron conductivity. Usually, it is made of a fabric, a non woven fabric or a porous article composed of glass fibers, polyethylene, polypropylene, etc. Desirably, the separator has a small thickness to reduce the internal resistance of the cell, but its thickness is determined by considering the amount of the electrolytic solution it holds, the flowabilty of the electrolytic solution through the separator, the strength of the separator, etc. The positive and negative electrodes and the separator are fixed within a cell casing 6 so as not to give rise to problems in use. The shape and size of the electrode are properly determined depending upon the shape and performance of the desired cell. For example, to produce a thin cell, the electrodes are suitably in the form of a film. To build a large capacity cell, a number of positive and negative electrodes in a film or plate form are alternately stacked. The second type cell of this invention comprising a positive electrode of the insoluble and infusible substrate and a negative electrode of an alkali metal or an alkaline earth metal will be described. With reference to Figure 3, in the second type cell, the negative electrode 2 is composed of an alkali metal or an alkaline earth metal. Other reference numerals have the same meanings as in the case of the first type cell. In the second type cell, the doping mechanism, i.e. the cell operating mechanism, is twofold. According to a first mechanism, doping of the insoluble and infusible substrate with an electron accepting dopant corresponds to charging, and undoping corresponds to discharging. For example, a cell built by using the undoped insoluble and infusible substrate and lithium as the electrodes and a 1 mole liter propylene carbonate solution of LiClO₄ as the electrolytic solution has an electromotive force of 2.5 to 3.0 V after building. When, a ClO₄ ion is doped into the insoluble and infusible substrate by applying voltage from an external power supply, the electromotive force of the cell rises to 3.5 to 4.5 V. According to a second mechanism, doping of an electrodonating dopant into the porous insoluble and infusible substrate corresponds to discharging, and undoping corresponds to charging. For example, a cell of the above construction has an electromotive force of 2.5 to 3.0 V after building. When a current is released outside and thus a lithium ion is doped into the insoluble and infusible substrate, the electromotive force of the cell is 1.0 to 2.5 V. When a lithium ion is undoped by applying voltage from an external power supply, the electromotive force of the cell is again 2.5 to 3.0 V. The doping or undoping may be carried out at a fixed current or voltage, or under conditions where the current and voltage vary. The amount of the dopant to be doped in the insoluble and infusible substrate, however, is preferably 0.5 to 20 in terms of the number of ions doped per carbon atom of the substrate. The cell of this invention comprising the porous insoluble and infusible substrate as an electrode is a secondary cell which can be repeatedly charged and discharged. Its electromotive force differs according to the construction of the cell. The first type has an electromotive force of 1.0 to 3.5 V. The second type has an electromotive force of 3.5 to 4.5 V when operated in accordance with the first mechanism, and 2.5 to 3.0 V when operated in accordance with the second mechanism The cell of this invention particularly has a high energy density per unit weight thereof, and when doped in proper amounts, has an energy density of about 500 WH kg of the insoluble and infusible substrate. The cell of this invention has a power density much higher than that of a lead battery although it differs depending upon the structure of the cell. Furthermore, the use of the porous insoluble and infusible substrate in this invention as an electrode can lead to the production of a secondary cell which has a low internal resistance, and can be repeatedly charged and discharged, and of which performance does not decrease over an extended period of time. The seconday cell produced by this invention comprises the porous insoluble and infusible substrate with a polyacen type skeletal structure having better oxidation resistance, heat resistance, moldability and mechanical strength than known organic semiconductors as an electrode, and an electrolytic solution composed of a solution in an aprotic organic solvent of a compound capable of forming ions dopable in the electrode by electrolysis, and uses an electron donating or accepting dopant doped in the electrodes as an electrode active substance. It is a novel high performance secondary cell having a very high capacity and a high output and capable of being reduced in size, thickness and weight. In the present application, the average pore diameter of open pores are measured and defined as follows wherein ℓi is the length of a line segment cut by a pore that crosses the straight line, is the is the sum of the length of the The following examples illustrate the present invention more specifically. The section of the resulting iodine doped film was examined by an electron microanalyzer EPMA to determine the state of distribution of iodine. It was found that iodine was uniformly distributed in the film. It is seen from the results of Table 1 that doping of iodine greatly increased the electrical conductivity of the porous semiconductor film. ClO₄ ions having a large ion radius could be doped smoothly within a short period of time because the porous semiconductors in accordance with this invention had fine open pores and a very high BET specific surface area. The amount of doping was expressed as the number of ions doped per carbon atom of the porous film substrate. In the present invention, the number of doped ions was determined from the current that flowed through the circuit. A voltage was applied to the cell from an external power supply, and ClO₄ ions were doped for about 5 hours in the porous insoluble and infusible film substrate at such a current density that the amount of doping per hour became 1 . As a result, the cell was charged. Then, the cell was discharged at the same current density until the cell voltage reached 2.5 V. Doping was carried out in a predetermined amount at the same current density as above to charge the cell. The cell was then discharged at the same rate to return the voltage to 2.5 V. The results are shown in Figure 4. In Figure 4, the ordinate represents the open circuit voltage of the cell, and the abscissa, the amount of doping. White circles correspond to charging, and black circles, to discharging. Curve 11 is a discharge curve after 2 doping curve 12, a discharge curve after 4 doping curve 13, a discharge curve after 6 doping and curve 14, a discharge curve after 8 doping. After 8 doping, the electromotive force of the cell was about 4.5 V, and the efficiency of charging discharging the amount of discharging the amount of charging was about 80 , and the cell had a capacity of as high as about 150 mAH g of the semiconductor. It had an energy density of about 500 WH kg of the semiconductor. During these tests, the internal resistance of the cell was as good as about 20 ohms in spite of the fact that the electrode area was as small as about 2 cm². The cell was charged for 6 hours by applying voltage from an external power supply at such a current density that the amount of doping per hour was 1 . The voltage of the cell after doping is shown in Table 3. The cell was then discharged at the same current density until the cell attained a voltage equal to that immediately after building of the cell. The charge efficiency, as the percentage of the amount of discharging based on the amount of charging, is shown in Table 3. This example illustrates the first type cell of this invention in which both the positive and negative electrodes were composed of the porous insoluble and infusible substrate in accordance with this invention. A cell was built by using the same porous substrate as used in Example 10 as the positive and negative electrodes and a 1 mole liter propylene carbonate solution of C₂H₅ ₄NClO₄ as the electrolytic solution, and subjected to a charging discharging test. Immediately after building, the cell had a voltage of 0 V. Then, by applying a voltage of 2.5 V from an external power supply for about 1 hour, ClO₄ ions were doped into the positive electrode, and C₂H₅ ₄N ions , into the negative electrode. The electromotive force of the cell was 2.5 V as a matter of course. The cell was then discharged at such a speed that the amount of undoping per hour was 3 . In about 1 hour, the voltage of the cell returned to 0 V. The above charging discharging test was repeated through about 1000 cycles to determine the durability of the cell. No deterioration in cell performance was observed. An aqueous solution prepared by mixing a water soluble resol about 60 in concentration , zinc chloride and water in a weight ratio of 10 25 4 was poured onto a glass plate by a film applicator. A polyester film was then put over the aqueous solution formed into the film, and the film was heated at about 100 C for 1 hour to cure it. The resulting cured film was washed with dilute hydrochloric acid and then with water, and dried to obtain a porous cured phenolic resin film having a thickness of about 200 micrometers. The porous film had an apparent density of 0.60 g cm³. It also had excellent flexibility and mechanical strength. An electron micrograph of the section of the film is shown in Figure 5. The resin portion had a three dimensional network structure, and an average pore diameter of not more than 10 micrometers.
