# Laser system for providing target specific energy deposition and damage.

## Abstract
A hand piece 20 for use with a laser 14 includes a scanning mechanism which controls dosimetry of radiation applied to a target area 12 which is adjustable to limit thermal diffusion from the light absorbing portion of the irradiated target site for selective target specific energy deposition. When used for dermatologic purposes, the adjustable scanning mechanism permits radiation to im pinge on tissue for a predetermined period of time for the selective necrosis of highly filled blood vessels, while leav ing adjacent tissue and empty blood vessels undamaged. The dwell time of the laser beam is designed to match the diffusion time for thermal destruction of the wall of the abnormal vessel, with the dwell time adjusted by the scanning rate.
