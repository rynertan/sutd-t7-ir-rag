# Lifting table.

## Abstract
A lifting table comprises at least two pairs of scissor arms 1, 2 pivotally interconnected by means of joints 6 and adapted to cooperate in raising and lowering a table 4 in relation to an underlying base portion 3 by means of at least one longitudinally extensible power transmission de vice, for example a hydraulic cylinder 12, 12 . A carrier member coupled with the power transmission device 12, 12 transversely of the longitudinal direction thereof, is inserted through an oblong hole 16 in a first scissor arm 1 and adapted to cooperate with a sloping slideway 21 on the second scissor arm 2 , said slideway being adapted, on displacement of the carrier member 15 from an initial position in which the scissor arms are in one plane, to provide a lifting of at least the first scissor arm into a position in which a substantial moment arm has been established between the carrier member and the joint 6 between the scissor arms.
