# A semiconductor device having a layered structure and a method of making it.

## Abstract
In known semiconductor devices, carrier mobility is limited to a considerable extent by impurity scattering. If the impurity concentration is reduced, so is the carrier concentration and hence the conductivity. In this invention a layered structure is employed in which wide bandgap layers alternate with narrow bandgap layers. The wide bandgap layers are doped 22 to provide the charge carriers 26 which, however, are transferred 30 to the narrow bandgap layers where they are essentially confined by band steps Î”E
