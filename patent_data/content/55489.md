## Description
This invention is directed to a process for flocculating an aqueous slurry containing minerals by the sequential addition of a synergistic amount of an anionic polymer followed by a cationic polymer. This process is especially suitable for flocculating taconite tailings. Taconite tailings are a by product of the beneficiation of iron ore. The beneficiation process involves dry and wet grinding of the ore to obtain small particles followed by separation or the iron bearing minerals. The separation of the iron bearing minerals The separation leaves behind a dilute aqueous slurry containing principally silica and ilmenita FeTiO3 as well as smaller amounts of clay and other minerals. The particles in the slurry settle very slowly. In order to speed the settling of the particles, cationic flocculants are widely used in corn bination with mechanical thickeners.However, the cationic flocculants tend to produce small flocs which do not compact into a high density, high solids content sediment which is sometimes desirable for the most efficientoperation of the mechanical thickeners. Thus9 a need exists to develop a process whereby a slurry containing mineralscan be floccula ted to produce higher sediment solids content. THE INVENTION It has no been found that an aqueous slurry containing minerals can be flocculated to produce a high sediment solid content by sequentially adding a synergistic amount of anionic polymer followed by a cationic polymer to the slurry and. thereafter allowing said minerals to settle from said slurry to provide a clear aqueous supernatant It has also been found that the process of this invention provides supernatant clarity equal to a flocculation process utilizing a cationic polymer at substantially lower total flocculant concentration. Additionally, settling rates of the flocs are faster using the process of this invention as compared to a process utilizing a cationic polymer. Furthers the results utilizing the process of this invention are especially surprising since the addition of a mi tre of a cationic and anionic polymer to the aqueous slurry containing minerals produces little flocculation. Additionally, the sequential addition of a cationic polymer followed by an anionic polymer to the aqueous slurry results in little, if any, improvement over using the cationic polymer alone. The anionic polymers which may be used in this invention are high molecular weight, synthetic, organic polymers characterized as consisting of linear carbon to carbon chains polyalkanes obtained by vinyl polymerizing one or more vinylidene monomers bearing a carbasylic or sulfonic acid group, or an alkali metal salt of such acidic groups. These polymers may be homopolymers or interpolymers. In such interpolymers, it is essential that sufficient carboxylic or sulfonic acid bearing monomers, or salts thereof, or such monomers with other monomers containing water solubilizing groups be present in the finished polymer to render it water soluble.Usually, a minimum of at least about 50 mole percent of the combined monomer moieties should bear water solu bilizing groups in order to insure that the resulting polymer is properly water soluble. Also, it is essential that a minimum of about 4 mole percent of the monomer moieties combined in the finished polymer should bear an anionic substiffrent of the specified class of sulfonic, sulfonate, and carboxylic groups. Rv hish moleculan waich as nnlied t the above anionic polymeric agents, is meant an average molecular weight of at least about 0.5 million.The term water soluble means dispersible in water to provide a visually continuous dispersion infinitely dilutable with water. A species of anionic polymer for use in accordance with the present invention as a high molec clear weight homopolymer of an alkali metal salt of vinyl benzene sulfonic acid. Similar polymers corres pont to water soluble copolymers prepared by the vinyl polymerization of a major proportion of vinyl benzene sulfonic acid, or an alkali metal salt thereof, and a minor proportion of a monomer copolymerizable therewith such as acrylamide, methacrylamide, acryloni trite, methacrylonitrile, styrene1 vinyl toluene, methyl acrylate and the like. For good results, such polymeric agents should have a molecular weight of at least 1,000,000 and more preferably of at least 4,000,000. Another variety of anionic polymers suitable for use in accordance with the invention is constituted by high molecular weight, water soluble copolymess of styrene and maleic anhydride. Such copolymers are generally employed in the form of the alkali metal salts thereof, preferably the sodium salt, although the acid form obtained by acid hydrolysis of the anhydride rings may also be employed. Tn order to obtain the advantages of the invention, it is necessary that the styrene maleic anhydride copolymers have molecular weights of at least 1,000,000 and preferably of at least 4,000,000. Anionic acrylic polymers that can be employed in the present invention are water soldble, substantially linear polymers of high molecular weight obtained by the vinyl polymerization of acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, sulfoethyl acrylate, carboxyethyl acrylate or water soluble salts of the foregoing acidic monomers or by copolymerization of the acidic monomers, or alkali metal salts thereof, with suitable amounts up to about 96 mole percent of other vinyl monomers such as acrylamide and me thacrylamide. Other suitable anionic acrylic polymers are obtained as the vinyl polymerization products of acrylamide or methac yLamide, or as the copolyinerization products of such monomers with other suitable monomers including, for example, acrylonitrile, methacryloni trile, lower alkyl esters of the acrylic acids, vinyl alkyl ethers and the like monoethylenically unsaturated compounds. During the polymerization reaction or thereafter with appropriate treatments, carboxamine moieties of the polymer are hydrolyzed to provide a desired number of anionic carboxylic or carboxylate groups. Anionic polymeric agents can also be produced by hydrolysis of preformed no2 ionic polymers.For example, vinyl polymerized forms of acrylonitrile or methacrylonitrile can be hydrolyzed by reacting them with an aqueous metal hydroxide solution to convert the nitrile groups to the corresponding alkali metal carboxylate groups. Similarly, polymers or copolymers of alkyl esters of unsaturated acids can be saponified with an alkali metal hydroxide to convert ester groups to alkali metal carboxylate groups. Preferred polymers are of the following formula EMI5.1 wherein R and R are, independently, H or CH3 is H , NH4 or an alkali such as Na or K or alkaline earth such as Mg or Ca metal ion m is O to 96, preferably 0 to about 60 m n p equal 100 z is greater than about 200 and A is at least one of the following EMI6.1 where R is H or CH3 and X isEMI6.2 wherein each R2 is H or CR3 and X3 isEMI6.3 EMI7.1 wherein X4 is Y , NH2 or OR3 R3 being CH3 or CCH orEMI7.2 wherein R4 and R 4 are, independently, H or CR3. Another preferred class of polymers are terpolymers having an intrinsic viscosity of from about 8 to about 30, preferably from about 12 to about 26 and most preferably from about 14 to about 25 dl g as measured in a one normal N aqueous sodium chloride solution at 25 C. The terpolymers are of the following general formula EMI7.3 wherein A, Al and A3 are independently hydrogen or K methyl, is an alkali metal ion, such as Na or K or an alkaline earth metal ion, such as Mg orCa , A4 is lower alkoxy or an acyloxy group, or an acryloxy preferablyEMI8.1 wherein A5 is alkyl of 1 to 5 carbon atoms, a constitutes from about 5 to about 90, preferably from about 30 to about 60 percent, b constitutes from about 5 to about 90, preferably from about 30 to about 60 percent, c constitutes from 0.1 to about 20, preferably from about 1 to about 5 percent, and d is an integer of from about 100 to about 100,000. The preferred terpolymers are of the following formula EMI8.2 wherein A6 is Na or K , A7 is methyl, ethyl, or butyl, and a, b, c, and d are as previously defined. Cationic polymers used in the invention are water soluble, synthetic, organic polymers characterized as containing in or attached along the polymeric chain a plurality of amino, imino or quaternary ammonium groups. The cationic, polyelectrolytes have no critical molecular limitations. It is preferred, however, to operate with higher molecular weight polymers. Representative of such cationic, nitro genous polymers are homopolymers and water soluble copolymers of one or more monomers such as N vinylpyridine and substituted derivatives thereof mono .di , or trialkylammonium salts, e.g., vinyl benzyl dimethylammonium chloride diallyl dimethylammonium chloride allylamine and N alkyl substituted derivatives thereof, aminoethyl acrylate hydrochloride or aminoethyl methacrylate hydrochloride and, in general, any ammonium or substituted ammonium alkyl acrylate or methacrylate such as N methyl or N,N dimethylaminoalkyl acrylate or methacrylate, wherein the alkyl groups contain 2 or 3 carbons, or the like. Other suitable cationic, nitrogenous polymers are obtained when a nitrogen containing monomer is copolymerized with one or more other monoethylenically unsaturated monomers capable of undergoing vinyl polymerization, provided that the resulting copolymer is water soluble and essentially free of anionic substituents.In such co polymers, at least about 5 mole percent, preferably at least 10 mole percent, of the monomers combined in the copolymer should be cationic, nitrogen containing monomers. Suitable monoethylenically unsaturated monomers to be copolymerized with these cationic monomers include acrylamide, methacrylamide, acrylonitrile, the lower alkyl esters of acrylic and methacrylic acids, vinyl methyl ether, N vinyl oxazolidinone, N vinyl pyrrolidinone and the like.It should be noted that for the purposes of preparing cationic polymers for the present invention, the amide groups, such as acrylamide, and nitrile groups, such as in acrylonitrile, are not sufficiently cationic. However1 monomers containing these groups can be employed in conjunction with other nitrogenous, cationic monomers to provide effective cationic polymers. When the comonomers employed in the preparation of cationic organic polymers embody water solubilizing groups, such comonomers may be present in amounts up to 95 mole percent of the combined moieties in the finished cationic, nitrogenous polymer. When hydrophobic comonomers such as the alkyl esters of acrylic and methacrylic acids or styrene are interpolymerized with the cationic monomers, it is generally required, in order to produce a water soluble polymer, that at least about 60 mole percent of the combined monomer moieties be hydrophilic, i.e., bearing water solubilizing groups. A class of cationic polymers is represented by ter soluble polyethylenimines of high molecular weight, substituted polyethylenimines and the mineral acid and quaternary ammonium salts thereof. Some polyethylenimines suitable for use in the invention can be represented by the formula EMI10.1 wherein As is hydrogen or methyl and n has a value of at least 400, preferably of at least 2,000. Desirable polyethylenimines can be characterized by the vis cosity of aqueous solutions thereof. Thus, water soluble polyethylenimines having viscosities of at least about 0.8 centistoke and preferably at least 2 centistokes for an aqueous, one percent by weight solution thereof are preferred cationic polymers.Also, the various salts of these polymers such as the interreaction products thereof with hydrochloric, sulfuric, phosphoric, carbonic and acetic acids are efficient cationic polymers. A useful group of cationic polymers which may be employed are the high molecular weight, watersoluble polymers of the dialkyl diallyl quaternary ammonium chlorides. The preparation and use of this class of compounds is. illustrated in Butler U.S. Pat.No. 3,288,770, Boothe U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,461,163 and 3,472,740, and Schuller, et al. U.S. Pat. No. 2,923,701. Another useful class of cationic polymers are the acryloxyalkyl quaternary ammonium compounds.The polymeric form of these compounds is represented by the formulaEMI11.1 wherein A10 is H or CH3 All is a lower alkyl group of 1 to 4 carbon atoms Al2 is H or a lower alkyl group of 1 to 4 carbon atoms X is an anion selected from chlorine, bromine, and methyl sulfate B is an alkyl group of 1 to 6 carbon atoms or an hydroxy alkyl group of l to 4 carbon atoms. The preferred monomers to make units of this structure are dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate, 2 hyd oxy 3 methacryloxy propyl trimethyl ammonium chloride, and, particularly, 2 methacryloxyethyl trims ethyl ammonium chloride. Still another useful class of cationic polymers are the acrylamido alkyl quaternary ammonium structures represented by the formula EMI12.1 where A10 is H or CH3 All is a lower alkyl group of 1 to 4 carbon atoms A12 is H or a lower alkyl group of 1 to 4 carbon atoms X is an anion selected from chlorine, bromine, and methyl sulfate B is an alkyl group of 1 to 6 carbon atoms or an hydroxy alkyl group of 1 to 4 carbon atoms. The preferred monomers to make units of this structure are dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate, 2 hydroxy 3 methacryloxy propyltrimethyl ammonium chloride, and particularly, 2 methacryloxyethyl trimethyl ammonium chloride. A particularly useful group of acrylamidoalkyl quaternary ammonium monomers are represented by the polymeric formulaEMI13.1 wherein Also, All, and X are as defined above and A13 is R or a linear or branched alkyl group of up to 5 carbon atoms and A14 is phenyl or a linear or branched alkyl group of up to 5 carbon atoms and n is an integer from 1 to 3. Also, the poly alwylation quaternary ammon ium compounds usually referred to as ionenes are useful. These types of polymers were first reported by C. S. Marvel in the early 1930 s and have been well documented in the literature since then. For example, see Ritter U.S. Pat. No. 2,Z61,002 Searle U.S. Pat. No. 2,271,378 Kirby U S. Pat. No. 2,375,853 and 2,388,614 Bock et al. U.S. Pat. No 2,454,547 and McCarty U.S. Pat. No. 3,206,462. The use of cationic condensation polymersare also included. These polymers may be polyethylene imines or partially quaternized polyethylene imines.They may also be cationic condensation polymers prepared by condensing pyalkylene polyamines with alkyl dihalides such as ethylene dichloride and or42 epoxyhalides such as epichlorohydrin. For example, seeWittcoff U.S. Pat. No. 2,483,749 Rogers et al. U.S.Pat. No. 3,320,317 Walker et al. U.S. Pat. No.3,428,680 Voss U.S. Pat. No. 3,408,440 and SchieggU.S. Pat. No. 3,391,090. The anionic and cationic polymers are well knawn in the art. In the practice of this invention, the aqueous slurry containing the minerals, particularly the aqueous slurry of taconite tailings, is first treated with from about 0.1 to about lOO, preferably from about 1 to about 25, parts per million parts or contained solid of the anionic polymer. The slurry is then mixed with the anionic polymer for about 0.5 to about 5 minutes.Then from about O.l to about 100, preferably from about 1 to about 25,parts per million parts of contained solid of the cationic polymer is added to the aqueous slurry and the combination mixed for about 0.5 to about 5.0 minutes. The slurry is generally treated at temperaturas of from about 5 to about 300C. After the slurry has been treated with the anionic and cationic polymers, settling of the minerals generally occurs within about TO minutes after the polymer treatment has been effected. The particular time of settling will vary depending upon the polymers composition, polymers molecular weight, the use level of polymers, and the like. Extended times of settling are not necessary since effective settling occurs rapidly. Once settling has occurred the clear supernatant liquid is removed using conventional equipment associated with such procedures.

The texpolymer had an intrinsic viscosity of 18.797 dl g as measured in a IN NaCl solution at 25 C . The following procedure was employed in adding the flocculant s to the aqueous slurry and tasting the resultant slurry for initial settling rate, supernatant clarity, and undetfloy solids content. Cylinder .Settlin Tests were used in the Examples. Tn this test a l liter glass cylinder was filled with 1000 ml of taconite tailing. If a single dosage of flocculant was used, it was added, as a 0.01 wc. 7. solution, at the start of the test. The cylinder was then stoppered and inverted 10 times to mix the flocculant with the tailing. The cylinder was placed on a bench and a stop watch was started. A piece of narrow masking tape was affixed vertically to the outside of the cylinder and the starting height of the tailing sample was marked on the masking tape. The height of the interface between clear supernatant and the settling solids was marked on the tape at 1.0 min. intervals for 8 10. minutes. At 2.0, 5.0 and 8.0 min. after the start of the test a Brinkman Probe Colorimeter was used to measure the 7.Transmittance clarity of the supernatant. When two flocculants were used the same procedure was followed, except that a 0.01 wt. Z solution of the first flocculant was added and the cylinder was inverted 5 times. Then a 0.01 wt. Z solution of the second flocculant was added and the cylinder was inverted 5 more times. Then the stopwatch was started. Initial Settling Rate t G The term t70 is defined as the time required for the interface between supernatant and sediment to move to 707. of the original height of the sample in the cylinder. This time, in seconds, was determined in the tests by plotting the height of the interface vs.time on linear rectangular coordinate paper, then reading the time to reach 705 of the origina1hfr from this graph. 7. Transmittance v T5 The Z Transmittance of the supernatant is measured at 2, 5 and 8 minutes after the start of the test. The following relationship exists between the transmittance, T, and the time, t, when the transmittance was measured T btm 1 or In T w m In t ln b 2 Linear regression analysis is used to calculate the statistically best value of T at t 1 S min., which is designated T5. Underflow Solids Content This technique includes one important assumption all the solids in the original tailing sample are in the sediment after the test is complete. To calculate the underflow solids content using this assumptionwe proceeded as follows EMI20.1 Where S the wt. 7. of solids in the cylinder in grams. A Solids content of tailing sample in wt. 7.. B Weight of the tailing sample in grams. Then D B S 4 Where D weight of water in the cylinder in grams.And. F H0 H5 C 5 Where F weight of water in the supernatant in grams H0 X original height of sample in the cylinder in inches the height of sediment in the cylinder 5 minutes after the start of the test in inches. C P the cylinder constant in gms of water inch.Therefore W P D F 6 Where W the weight of water in the sediment in grams. And EMI21.1 Where S5 X wt. 7. solids in the sediment 5 minutes after the start of the test.Or, by combining equations 3 to 6 EMI21.2 Control A The initial settling rate, percent transmittance and underflow solids content of an aqueous slurry of taconite tailings was measured according to the pro cedura described, supra.
