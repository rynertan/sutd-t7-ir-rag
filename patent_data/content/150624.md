# Low shrinkable unsaturated polyester resin composition.

## Abstract
Disclosed herein is a low shrinkable unsaturated po lyester resin composition consisting of A 20 70 by weight of an unsaturated polyester B 28 60 by weight of a monomer polymerizable with the above unsaturated polyester, C 2 20 by weight of a block copolymer mixture de fined in the following, and in which a mixture of the mono mer B and the block copolymer mixture C is in a non aqueous dispersion state and a mixture of the above po lyester A , the monomer B and the block copolymer mix ture C is in a non aqueous dispersion state, said block co polymer mixture is a copolymer obtained by polymerizing either one of monomers defined below in a and b here inafter referred to as monomer a and monomer b respec tively or a mixture thereof by using as a polymerization ini tiator a polymeric peroxide represented by the general formula
