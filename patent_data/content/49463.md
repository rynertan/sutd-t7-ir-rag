# Preparation of linear polyalkylene polyamines.

## Abstract
A process for selectively preparing predominantly non cyclic polyalkylene polyamine compounds are disclosed wherein an alkylene polyamine compound is contacted with a hydroxy compound in the presence of a catalytically effective amount of a salt of a nitrogen or sulfur containing substance or the corresponding acid at a temperature of from 250 to 300 C under a pressure sufficient to maintain the reaction mixture essentially in liquid phase. The polyalkylene polyamine thus formed is recovered from the reaction mixture.
