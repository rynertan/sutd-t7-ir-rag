# Semiconductor integrated circuit device.

## Abstract
A MOS transistor integrated circuit device has at least one interconnection layer 17, 18 crossing the source and drain regions 11, 12 of a MOS transistor such that it overlies these source and drain regions. An electrical conductive layer 29, 30 is formed on the surface of at least one of the source and drain regions 11, 12 of the MOS transistor. The electrical conductive layer crosses the interconnection layer with an insulating layer therebetween such that it underlies the inter connection layer. The electrical conductive layer is separated from source and drain takeout electrodes 15,14 and electri cally insulated from the interconnection layer.
