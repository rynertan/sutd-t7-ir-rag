# Valve assembly.

## Abstract
A valve assembly has a tapered valve body 21 disposed within a tapered bore 17 in a housing 14 with a rotatable tapered valve member 22 to control flow of a radioactive slurry through the housing. The valve body has a sealing liner 46 on its outer wall and a sealing liner 38 on its inner wall. The valve body 21 has a rib arrangement 30 acting through the sealing liner to form pressure sealing areas with the rotat able valve member 22 . The rotatable valve member 22 is rotated through rotation means 165 by a remote actuator 124 . The rotation means 65 is disposed within an extension 82 connected to the valve body 21 . The extension means of the valve body is disposed within an extension secured to the housing. When the valve unit 20 is to be replaced, a positive air flow is produced from an access opening to the actuator 124 by a suction pump 159 .
