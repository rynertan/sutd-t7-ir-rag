# CHEMICAL SENSORS HAVING A HYDROPHILIC MEMBRANE AS THE ELECTROLYTE MEDIA

## Abstract
A chemical sensor having a pair of spatially separated electrodes 16, 18 and a thin structurally stable hydrophilic membrane 12 disposed therebetween. The hydrophilic membrane 12 is the host media for a liquid electrolyte and confines the liquid electrolyte to the region between the two electrodes 16, 18 . The chemical sensor embodying the hydrophilic membrane 12 has the physical characteristics of a solid state device yet preserves all the attributes of a wet chemical sensor.
