# Heat exchanger with leak detecting double wall tubes.

## Abstract
A straight shell 3 and tube heat exchanger utilizing double wall tubes and three tubesheets 9, 11, 13 to en sure separation of the primary and secondary fluid and reliable leak detection of a leak of either the primary or the secondary fluids. This ensures that there is no undetected mixing of the two fluids.
