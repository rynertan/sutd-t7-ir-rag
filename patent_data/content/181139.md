# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR PRIMING AND PURGING BLOOD TREATMENT APPARATUS

## Abstract
In this method for initially priming a blood constituent treatment circuit which includes one or more various blood treatment devices, the steps are included of switching by a controller one or more conduit switching valves provided at appropriate locations in the blood constituent treating circuit so as to create a local circuit in one part thereof circulating to the local circuit an initial circulating fluid of physiological saline fluid or an equivalent thereof and initiating by the controller a completing action according to visual evaluation by the operator. The controller terminates one such set of steps before again performing another such set of steps to create another separate local circuit, the steps being repeat edly performed until substantially all of the air and other foreign matter in the blood treatment devices in the blood constituent treatment circuit has been purged and the blood constituent treatment circuit is substantially full only of the initial circulating fluid. A device is also disclosed for perform ing the method.
