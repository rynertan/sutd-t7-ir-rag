# Method and apparatus for moving objects by floatation on a gas cushion.

## Abstract
Apparatus for moving an object which is floatable on a cushion of gas from a first station to a second station. A porous table 10 over which the object 30 is moved is divided into a plurality of zones of gas flow. Contiguous gas zones can have the same amount of gas flowing therethrough thereby to define areas of gas flow 1 2 5 , 7 , 8 . The areas of gas flow are never larger than the object being moved thereover. The areas of gas flow 1 2 5 , 7 , 8 have different amounts of gas flow with the largest accuring at the first station 20 and the lowest at the second station 40 . When an object 30 is placed at the first station 20 , it is supported on areas having two different amounts of gas flow. This causes the object to tip front end downwardly in the area of lowest gas flow and thereby be moved the porous table member 10 eventually to the second station 40 .
