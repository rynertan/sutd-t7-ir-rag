# Coin feeder device for coin counter.

## Abstract
Coins to be counted are fed into a hopper 1 disposed above a rotary disk 2 which exerts a centrifugal force on coins fed thereto. A controller 3 provided between the hopper discharge opening and the rotary disk prevents coins being fed by centrifugal force toward the periphery of the disk one on top of another. A sorting ring 4 surrounds the peripheral part of the disk to prevent coins from falling off the edge of the disk. An arcuate section or small sorting ring 7 which forms a part of the sorting ring 4 defines a gap for passage of coins from the rotary disk to a sorter 5 . The sorter 5 sorts coins to be counted from those not to be counted.

## Description
COIN FEEDER DEVICE FOR COIN COUNTER The present invention relates to a coin feeder device for coin counter, more particularly, to a device for smoothly carrying out feeding of coins from the rotary disk designed to exert centrifugal force to the coin to the counter. The conventional coin counter as shown in Fig. 18 comprises a rotary disk B for exerting a centrifugal force to the coins X,D in a space formed by the sorting ring, a hopper A in a position deviated frorn the rotary axis 3 of the rotary disk1 a conveyor device C for feeding coin between the hopper A and the upper position of the rotary disk B, and further, with a cutout provided at a part of the sorting ring, a small sorting ring at the cutout portion to form a space for delivery of the coins to allow passave of a coin, and a sorting course E which is designed to permit to freely adjust the space broader or narrower continued to the space for delivery of coins. Accordingly, the coins D,D1 which have been fed onto the rotary disk by means of the conveyor device w from the hopner A are subjected to centrifugal force by the rotary disk 3 to collide against the inner circumferential surface of the sorting ring and rotate with the rotary disk B to be scattered, and led to the sorting course through the coin delivery space. And, when the coins are allowed to run on the sorting course in one direction by means of the feed belt provided on the upper part at the central part of the sorting course E and the coins D of the smaller diameter than the designed diameter to be counted are caused to drop through the gap in the sorting course, sorting out between the coins to be counted and the coins not to be counted is feasible. However, if too large number of coins are fed onto the rotary disk at a time, a number of coins are accumulated at random on the rotary disk and are not ideally scattered, and sorting condition becomes extremely unfavorable, making it impossible to send out the coins smoothly to the sorting course through the delivery slit. Therefore1 it is necessary to provide a coin detector to control driving of the conveyor device by means of the output signal of the coin detector. ven hen the coin detector is provided, depending on the set amount of the coin to stop the conveyor device, there would be cases where the coins cannot be sufficiently sorted by spreading or the coins are spread in sparse state on a rotary disc, giving rise to lowering of coin feeding efficiency. Further, some of the coins to be fed from the conveyor device and caused to drop assume upright condition at right angles to the rotary disc. Therefore, in order to let fall the upright coins, there are provided the projections of a certain configuration on the inner lateral side of the separating ring which surrounds the rotary disk. Accordingly, this will make the coin counter not only conplicated as a whole but also large sized, especially make higher the position of the upper opening of the hopper at least by a weight of the conveying device, thus involving a defect of causing a difficulty to the work of charging the heavy bagged coins. Another defect is that on each action of the conveyor device the coins drop on the metal rotary disk to produce fairly large noise by the impact between the mentals. According to the invention, there is provided a coin feeder device for coin counter, comprising a hopper into which the coins to be counted can be fed, a rotary disk which supports the coins to be counted fed into the hopper and exerts centrifugal force to the coins to be counted, a control means provided between the lower end of the opening of said hopper and the rotary disk so as to control the number of the laid coins to be counted which slide toward the periphery of the rotary disk by rotation, a sorting ring surrounding the peripheral part of the rotary disk to prevent jinping out of the coins, a small sorting ring which constitutes a part of the sorting ring and forts a gap for coin path with the rotary disk, and a sorting means which is linked with the coin path gap and makes it possible to take out the coins to be counted and the coins not to be counted into the different positions by dropping the coins not to be counted.

The hopper 1 is shaped in downwardly tapered form by metal, synthetic resin, etc., and by being suspended integrally with the upper opened part of the coin counter casing 11 made of metal, synthetic resin, etc., being set at a fixed position so that the lower end opening 12 of circular section is positioned above the central part of the rotary disk 2 . Further, by making the inner diameter of the lower end opening 12 of the hopper 1 more than about twofold the maximum diameter of the coins to be counted, occurrence of choking of coins is prevented before material izat ion. The rotary disk 2 is provided on its upper surface of the central part with a conical projection 21 , and a friction plate 22 made of rubber or urethane resin so as to surround the projection 21 . The upper surface of the periphery of the rotary disk 2 is flush with the upper surface of the frictional plate 22 . The projection 21 is integrally provided with a columnar shaft 23 at the central part on the upper surface of the conical member, and Åa columnar shaft 24 downwardly at the central part on its lower surface. The columnar shaft 24 thrusts through the rotary disk 2 and the rotary shaft 25 of the rotary disk 2 so as to make the projection 21 rotatable integrally with the rotary disk Ca . The controller 3 is constituted mainly by a circular cross sectional tube 31 made of a metal or urethane resin.Its upper periphery is horizontally extended outward by projection. Thrusting through the outer peripheral portion, there is provided a guide rod 32 planted at the designed fixing position of the counter body to accommodate divided ring, etc. By loosely fitting the coil spring 33 onto the guide rod 32 , the tube 31 is always pressed downward.By curving the lower periphery of the tube 31 outwardly, sliding of the coins to be counted is facilitated, and the lower periphery of the tube 31 is position set so that it will be lower than the opening 12 of the hopper 1 and higher than the upper surface of the rotary disk 2 , centering on the rotary shaft of the rotary disk together with the opening at the lower end of the hopper1 so that, by the distance between the lower periphery of the tube 31 and the upper surface of the rotary disk 2 , the number of laying of the coins to be counted is controlled.It is desirable for the opening at the lower end of the hopper, the controller, and the rotary disk to be aligned at their centers on the same center line. The sorting ring 4 is constituted by the tubular member of a designed height which surrounds the peripheral part of the rotary disk 2 . With its designed position cut out, a cutout 41 for setting the small dividing ring is formed. The sorting course 5 comprises a pair of guide plates 51 51 placed in parallel to each other at a certain distance. The guide plates are provided at the top ends of their opposed inner lateral sides with grooves 52 52 to support the peripheral part of the coin. Above the central part of the guide plates 51 5i , there is provided an endless belt 51 which causes to advance the coins while pressing them down toward the counted coin guide metal 6 . Further, there is provided a spring 54 which applies force to one guide plate 51 in the direction to separate from the other guide plate 51 . Also, there is provided a denomination cam 51 which sets the position of the guide plate 51 resisting the applied force of the spring 54 .Accordingly, by operating the denomination cam 51 , the gap between the guide plates 51X 51 can be changed to sort out the coin of the desired denominations large diameter and small diameter ones . At the terminal portion of the course there is provided a sensor G which generates pulse on passage of the coin so as to send a signal to the counter device The counted coin guide metal 6 comprises a tube which has at its upper periphery a feed inlet 62 which guides the coin which has passed the sorting course and a coin discharge port 63 at its lower periphery. It is formed in gradually expanded outer diameter toward the lower end.It is loosely fitted with a ring 64 so as not to allow pulling out downward, so that the outer circumferential surface of the tube and the ring 64 cooperate to hold by pressing narrow the mouth portion of the sorted and counted coin container bag 61i. The small sorting ring 7 to be inserted to set into the cutout 41, of the sorting ring 4 comprise6, as shown in Fig. 13 and Fig. 15, by engaging with the guide tube 72 which is erected to fix to the designed fixing position of the coin counter body and which contains a coil spring 71 , in a manner to be always forced upwardThe small sorting ring 7 comprises a holding tube 74o of a large diameter to be engaged with the guide tube 72 , an arc plate 75 positioned on the extension of the sorting ring 4 , a flat plate 77 to form a gap 76 for passage of coin with the upper surface of the rotary disk 2 by being provided at the lower end of the arc plate 75 , an eccentric pin 79 to hold the coin path gap 76 to a fixed amount by engaging with the fitting. plate 78 provided at a designed position of the large diameter tube 74 , and link rods 80 , 81 , 82 , and 83 which work in linkage with the motion of the above denomination cam 51 to move the eccentric pin 79 up and down to let the coin path gap 76 vary The part 84 is an engaging member which is always forced upward by the coil spring 71 in the guide tube 72 and project up from the guide tube 72 to prevent slipping out. It is designed to force the small sorting ring 7 always upward in engagement with the cover plate 85 which covers the upper opening of the large diameter holding tube 74 . Also, the fitting plate 78 is formed on its lower half part into downwardly tapered form to form a tapered surface 86 . Also, continued to the upper periphery of the tapered surface 86 there is formed a square cutout recess 87 .Further, between the designed position of the link rod 80 provided axially with an eccentric pin 79 and the designed fixing position of the coin counter body a spring 88 is stretched to give force to the ink rod 80 sd as to have the eccentric pin 79 set into the cutout recess 87 . Further, the link rods 80 , 81 , 82 , and 83 are forced respectively in one direction by being forced by the coil spring 71 . They are mutually axially connected so as to permit the roll 89 axially provided at an end of the link rod 83 to be in pressure contact with the outer circumferential cam surface of the thickness adjusting cam 55 which coordinates with the denomination cam 51 . Accordingly, the denomination cam 51 and the thickness adjusting cam 55 may be operated in coordination with the kind of the coin to be counted, and the motor not shown is energized to drive the rotary disk 2 for rotation and run the endless belt 53 , under which condition a number of coins to be counted may be charged at a time into the hopper l . Feeding of coins is conducted in a manner as described hereinafter. The coins lying in the lowest position which are in contact with the rotary disk 2 at the lower end opening 12 is subjected to centrifugal force by the rotation of the rotary disk 2 and slid toward the sorting ring 4 .At this time, as the coins slide outward through the gap between the rotary disk 2 and the controller 3 , by setting the gap between the rotary disk 2 and the controller to a designed amount which is larger than the thickness of a piece of coin and smaller than the thickness corresponding to twice the thickness that of the thickness of the coin, the coin can be slid piece by piece. For example, when the coins in two layered state tend to slide outwardly, the controller 3 shifts upward, resisting the coil spring jug to clamp the two coins up and down.Since the friction force between the lowermost coin and the friction plate 22 is the largest and the friction force between the coins is extremely small, the lowermost coins are subjected to large centrifugal force, whereas the coins on the upper position are subjected to scarce centrifugal force. Eventually, only the coins on the lowermost position are slid toward the sorting ring 4 . Also, when the coins have large diameters and slide outwardly under the condition of being kept in inclined state by the projection 21 , the controller 3 is shifted upward resisting the coil spring 33 to make it possible for the coins to move smoothly. Since the coins which have slid to a position to come into contact with the sorting ring 4 rotate with the rotary disk 2 and fed one by one to the sorting course 5 through the coin path gap 76 formed by the small sorting ring 7j, the coins of the largest diameter to be sorted are advanced by the endless belt 53 , their passages are detected by the sensor G, dropped through the counted coin guide 6 into the counted coin container bag 611, and other coins of smaller diameter D are dropped through the gap between the guide plates 51 51 which constitutes the sorting course 5 and fed to other coin counter or recovered. In the above case, when the amount of the coins which slide by centrifugal force from the hopper 1 toward the sorting ring 4 is larger than the amount of the coins to be fed to thesorting course 5 , there will be the condition where more than two coins are accumulated at the peripheral part of the rotary disk 2X. But, at the initiai stage the coins slide under the unaccumulated condition, so that the coin sorting function is improved. Also, as it is possible by the projection 21 to support the coins at the position deviated from the center of the rotary disk 2 , the coins can be slid securely toward the peripheral portion. The present invention device can not only make the conveyor device for feeding the coins to be counted unnecessary and miniaturize the coin counter size but also facilitate the work of charging the heavy coins packed in bags by lowering the upper opening position of the hopper at least by the height of the conveyor device. Moreover, it can allow to produce noise only in the beginning of the charging of coins in the hopper and thus to suppress generation of noise. Further, even if the rotary disk does not exactly maintain horizontality, smooth supply of coin is assured. Fig. 4 shows an embodiment of the above construction with modification of the construction of the controller 3 , wherein the controller 3 is constituted by the tubular member molded by an elastic material such as urethane resin, and by fitting the tubular member into the hopper 1 , the outer circumference of the lower end of the hopper 1 is covered with the upper half part of the tubular member. The gap between the rotary disk 2 and the lower end periphery of the tubular member is set to an amount larger than the thickness of a piece of coin and smaller than the twofold thickness of the coin. Also, the elasticity held by the tube is so set as to permit the lowest positioned piece of coin to slide readily outwardly and to prevent exactly outward sliding of the coin accumulated on the upper surface of the coin on the lowest position. Consequently, the coin on the lowest position which is subjected to centrifugal force by the rotary disk 2 is outwardly slid by causing elastic deformation or without causing deformation, and the rest of the coins are prevented from sliding, thus assuring exact sliding of the coins piece by piece outward and permitting sorting of the coins in the same manner as in the embodiment shown in Figs and 2. Since the other portions of constitution are the same as those of the foregoing embodiment, detailed explanations are omitted. In summary, in the case of the embodiment of Fig. 4 the guide rod 32 and the coil spring 33 may be omitted, so that the construction of the coin counter can be further simplified. The coin counter as shown in Figs. 5 to 7 is a modification of the embodiment of Fig. 1 with respect to the construction of the tubular member 31 which constitutes the controller 3 and the fitting structure of the tubular member 31 and the sorting ring 4 . The controller 3 is constituted mainly by a tube 31 of urethane resin which has elasticity. Its configuration is downwardly expanding form. On the outer side wall at the top end there is formed an annular groove which accommodates to hold the support 35 which supports the ring 34 , and at the periphery of the upper end opening there is formed in one piece an upper outwardly extending elastic annular hook 36 50 that the elastic annular hook 36 can be brought into pressure contact with the lower outer circumference of the hopper 1 to prevent the coins from jumping out between the hopper 1 and the tubular member 31 , so that, even when the hopper 1 is deformed under the weight of the charged coins and lowered, the hopper 1 and the tubular member 31 are exactly connected by its elasticity. The gap between the lower end periphery of the controller 1 and the rotary disk 2 requires to be set to be larger than the thickness of the thickest coins to be counted. However, if the gap is too large, many pieces of coins are to be delivered under the accumulated state to give undesirable effect. Therefore, it is most desirable to set the gap to a degree of more than twofold the diameter of the coins having the largest diameter to be counted. The support 35 is constituted by an annular member formed on its inner periphery to be engageable with the above annular groove. Its outer periphery is stepped down.On its lowest surface a ring 34 of urethane resin is set to support, and the lower end surface of the ring 34 is set to be on nearly the same level as the lower end face of the controller 3 . The member 37 is a fitting arm fixed at its one end to the designed position of the base on the outside of the sorting ring. The lower end of the bolt 38 thrusted through the other end of the fitting arm 37 in a manner movable up and down is connected by screwing with the support 35 at its designed position, and further, it always exerts downward pressure to the support 35 and the controller 3 by loosely resiliently accommodating the coil spring 39 to the bolt 38 between the fitting arm 37 and the support 35 . The oonstitutions of sorting ring 4 , small sorting ring 7 , sorting course 5 , and sorted and counted coin guide metal 6 are the same as those shown in the foregoing embodiment. Accordingly, the function of supply of coins to the sorting course 5 from the small sorting ring 7 by the rotation of the rotary disk is conducted in entirely the same action. If, in its feeding action1 the amount of the coins to slide from the controller 3 to the sorting ring 4 this larger than the amount of the coins to be fed to the sorting course 5 , the amount of the coins laid on the rotary disk increases to a condition to be accumulated by more than two pieces. When the coins become accumulated in multiple, the coins on the upper position are to be laid between the controller 3 and the sorting ring 4 .By these coins, the lower end portion of the controller 3 is pressed inward to narrow the gap between the rotary disk 2 and the controller 3 , thereby providing a possibility for the smooth sliding of the coins to be prevented. However, in the present embodiment, the coins on the upper position are laid between the support 35 and the sorting ring 4J and they do not come into contact with the controller 3 , so that there is no danger at all for the gap between the rotary disk 2 and the controller 3 to be narrowed, and the coin sorting efficiency can always be maintained on a high level. In this respect, this embodiment is superior to that shown in Figs. 1, 2, and 3. Also, according to the present embodiment, by setting the denomination cam 51 and the thickness adjusting cam 55 to the size of the maximum diameter coin to be counted, the eccentric pin 79 is raised via the link rods 83 , 82 , 81 and 80 , and the small sorting ring 7 is raised to the position at which the cutout recess 87 is engaged with the eccrntric pin 79 , by which the coin path gap 76 can be set in tune with the thickness of the above maximum diameter coin. In the coin counter, the portion where choking of coin is most liable to occur s experimentarily known to be the portion of the small sorting ring 7 , and, when choking up of coin occurs, the small sorting ring 7 has to be removed to dissolve choking of coin. By swinging the link rod 80 against the spring 88 the engagement of the eccentric pin 79 with the cutout recess 87 is released, and the small sorting ring 7 is forced to rise under the spring force of the coil spring 71 . Thereafter, by drawing out the small sorting ring 7 as it is, the upper part of the gap for coin path can be opened free, by which choking of coins can be simply dissolved. After dissolution of the choking of coin, the operation may be only to engage the large diameter holding tube 74 with the guide tube 72 and push down. By the step of the engagement of the tapered surface 86 of the fitting plate 78 with the eccentric pin 79 , firstly the link rod 80 can be swung, and then, when the link rod 80 is returned to engage the eccentric pin 79 with the cutout recess 87j, the small sorting ring 7 can be held in a manner to suppress slipping out. The embodiment of the coin counter as shown in Figs.8 to 10 is the one which has the most desirable construction.The difference of this embodiment from that. shown in Figs.5 to 7 is that this embodiment is provided with a control plate 101 and a supporting plate 102 in place of the above ring 34 , support 35 , and fitting arm 37 . The coin counter furnished with the coin feeder device of the present invention shown in Figs. 8 to 10 comprises a hopper 1 to feed the coins to be sorted, a rotary disk 2 which exerts a centrifugal force to the coins to be sorted D,D under the hopper 1 , a controller 3 to control the number of accumulated coins which slide toward the peripheral part of the rotary disk 2 , a sorting ring 4 which surrounds the peripheral part of the rotary disk 2 , a sorting course 5 which is connected with the cutout 41 for accommodating the small sorting ring formed at the designed position of the sorting ring 4 , and a counted and sorted coin guide metal 6 which hangs the counted coin container bag 61 . The hopper 1 is made of metal or synthetic resin and formed in downwardly tapered configur tion. The hopper 1 is so positioned that, by being suspended integrally with the upper opening of the coin counter casing 11 of metal or synthetic resin material, the lower end portion 12 thereof is positioned above the center of the rotary disk 2 . By designing the inner diameter of the opening 12 at the lower end of the hopper 1 to be larger than about twice that of the maximum diameter of the coins to be cdunted, occurrence of choking up of coins are prevented before materialization. The rotary disk 2 has on the upper surface of its central part a conical projection 21 . Surrounding the projection 21 there is provided a friction plate 22 of rubber or urethane resin. Further, the upper surface of the rotary disk 2 and the upper surface of the friction plate 22 are set to be in flush relation. The projection 21 is provided at the central part of the conical member vertically with a columnar shaft 23 in one piece, and at the central part of the lower surface with a columnar shaft 24j downwardly. The columnar shaft 24 is thrusted through the rotary disk 2 and the rotary shaft 25 of the rotary disk 2 , so that the projection 21 is rotatable in one piece with the rotary disk 2 . The controller 3 is constituted mainly of the circular cross sectional tube 31 of urethane resin or the like.Further, at the upper end periphery there is formed an elastic annular hook 36 which extends in upper outward direction in one piece, so that the elastic annular hook 36 is made possible to be in pressure contact with the lower end outer circumferential surface of the hopper 1 , thereby preventing the jumping out of the. coin between the hopper 1 and the tubular member 31 , and, even in case of the deformation of the hopper 1 under the load of the input coins and lowering of its position, the hopper 1 and the tubular member 31 are exactly connectable by their flexibility. In the present embodiment, the gap between the lower end of the controller 3 and the rotary disk 2 requires to be so set as to become larger than the thickness of the thickest coins of those to be counted. However, as the control of the number of coins to be accumulated is to be made by the control plate 101 to be described later, the device of the present embodiment does not necessitate at all to set the gap to twice as large as the thickness of the thickest coin, different from the cases of the aforedescribed embodiments. Since the gap can be more than twofold the thickness of the thickest coin, sliding of the coin can be more smoothly made. And, the inner diameter of the controller 3 is desirably more than about twice the diameter of the coins having the largest diameter. The above controller 3 is immovably supported by engaging the inner circumferential periphery of the annular support ioa whose outer circumferential periphery is fixed at its designed positions to the designed positions of the base situated outside the sorting ring with the above annular groove 100 . The above control plate 101 is constituted by a plate of donut like form covering the upper part of the rotary disk 2 between the lower end outer periphery of the controller 3 and the sorting ring 4 . By bending the outer peripheral part, inner peripheral part, and central part upward, the bend strength in the direction of thickness is improved.The bolt 103 erected on the upwardly bent portion at the central area by screwing at its lower end is loosely inserted to move up and down into the designed position of the supporting plate 102 . Further, between the supporting plate 102 and the control plate 101 , the bolt 103 is loosely accommodated with a coil spring 104 of small spring force, by which the control plate 101 is at all times forced toward the rotary disk 2 . The gap between the control plate 101 and the rotary disk 2 under the condition where the control plate 101 is in the most lowered position is set to be slightly larger than the thickness of the thickest coin. Screw connection of the lower end of the bolt 103 with the upwardly bent portion securely prevents the lower end periphery of the bolt 103 from projecting below the coin pressing surface lowest surface of the control plate 101 . The sorting ring 4 is constituted by a tubular member of a designed height which surrounds the periphery of the rotary disk 2 , and has a cutout 41 for accommodating small sorting ring at a designed position. The sorting course 5 comprises a pair of guide plates 51 51 . On the upper ends of the opposed inside surfaces there are provided the grooves 52 52 for supporting the periphery of the coin. And, on the upper position of the guide plates 51 51 there is provided an endless belt 53 which is designed to cause the coins advance toward the counted coin guide metal 6 while pressing them downward. Further, there is provided a spring 54 which exerts force in the direction to alienate one guide plate 51 from the other guide plate 51 . A thickness adjusting cam 55 which sets the position of the guide plate 51 resisting the force of the spring 54 and the denomination cam 51 which coordinates with it are provided. Accordingly1 by operating the thickness adjusting cam 55 and the denomination cam 51 , the gap between the guide plates 51 51 can be varied to select the coins of the desired denominations. The sorted and counted coin guide metal 6 forms at its upper end an inlet 62 which leads the coins after passing the sorting course, and comprises a tubular member formed at its lower end with an outlet 63 for coins.It is formed in such configuration as to be gradually enlarged in its outer diameter nearly toward the lower end, and loosely accommodated with a ring 64 so that the mouth of the sorted coin container bag 61 is clamped by pressing with the outer circumferential surface of the tube and the ring 64 50 as not to allow the container bag 61 to be pulled downward. The small sorting ring 7 in this embodiment comprises, as shown in Fig. 16 and Fig. 17, the means to be engaged with the guide tube t72 which is erected to be fixed to the designed fixing position of the coin sorter body and which self contains a coil spring 71 so as to be always forced upward.It is constituted by a large diameter holding tube 74 having a hole 73 for engagement with the guide tube 72 , an arc plate 75 situated on the extension of the sorting ring 4 , a flat plate 77 provided at the lower end periphery of the arc plate 75 to form a gap t76 for coin path with the upper surface of the rotary disk 2 , an eccentric pin 79J which is designed to keep the gap 76 for coin path constant by being engaged with the fitting plate 78 which is provided to be movable up and down at the designed position of the large diameter holding tube 74 , and the link. rods 80 , 81 , 82 and 83 which are operated in linkage with the operation of the denomination cam 55 to move the eccentric pin 79 up and down so as to vary the size of gap 76 for coin path. Fig. 11 and Fig. 12 show an embodiment which is designed to make it possible to vary the lowest position of the central plate 101 shown in igs. 8 to 10. The bolt 103 is upwardly extended. he cam 1051 is loosely accommodated in the bolt 103 in a manner to prevent slipping out and to be freely rotatable between the supporting plate 102 and the head of the bolt 103 . On the lower face of the cam 105i there are provided grooves 106 106 . On the upper surface of the supporting plate 102 there are placed the balls 107 107 so as to permit only self rolling, and the lower surface of the cam 105 is received at all times by the balls 107 107 . At the upper end of the cam 105 an L shaped metal 108 is fixed in one piece, and the adjacent L shaped metals are mutually connected by the link rod 109 . This makes it possible for all cams 105 to rotate simultaneously. By allowing to couple the grooves 106 106 of the lower surface of the cam 105 with the balls 107 107 , the control plate 101 is levelled down, and by allowing the bottom surface portions other than the groove to be supported by the upper surface of the balls 107 107 , the control plate is levelled up. The member 110 is a handle for operation which is fixed in one piece with the cam 105 . The member 111 is a spring for changing over the cam stretched between either of the L shaped metal 108 and the designed position of the supporting plate 102 . Accordingly, in case of the sorting of the coins which have large diameter and thickness, the operating handle no is operated to rotate all the cams 105 simultaneously, and, of the lower surfaces of each cam, the bottom surface portions other than the groove may be allowed to be supported by the upper surfaces of the balls 107 107 to cause the control plate 101 to go up. The thick coins to be counted are then accumulated not more than two pieces in the gap between the rotary disk 2 and the control plate 101 , by which it becomes possible to feed the coins to be counted in the same manner as in the embodiments ofFig. 6 and Fig. 7. In case of feeding the coins having small diameter and small thickness, the handle 110 for operation may be operated to rotate simultaneously all the cams 105 to engage the balls 107 107 with the grooves 106 106 out of the lower surfaces of cams 105 , and the thin coins to be counted become accumulated in no more than two pieces in the gap between the rotary disk 2 and the control plate 101 , thereby allowing to effect feeding and sorting of coins in the same manner as in the embodiments of Fig. 6 and Fig. 7. The member 84 is an engaging member which project above the guide tube 72 to prevent slipping, under exertion of the force at all times upward by means of the coil spring in the inside of the tube 72 . The part 90 is a fine adjustment cam inserted in the upper half part of the large diameter tube 74 so as to be rotatably driven by means of the operating knob 91 . The member 92 is a pin which is planted on the fitting plate 78 , thrusting through the slit 93 on the side wall of the large diameter tube 74 to be engaged with the upper end cam surface 94 of the fine adjustment cam 90 . The member 95 is a click stop ball which is forced by the spring 96 and designed to prevent accidental rotation of the operating knob.The distance for the fitting plate 78 to be movable up and down is set to he the same as or the largerthan the distance for the pin 92 to be movable up and down by the rotation of the fine adjustment cam 90 . The lower half of the fitting plate 78 is formed into a downwardly tapered surface form 86 , and, continued to the upper end periphery of the tapered surface 86 there is formed a square cutout recess 87 to accommodate the eccentric pin 79 . Further, a spring 88 is stretched between the designed position of the link rod 80 axially provided with an eccentric pin 79 anl the designed fixing position of the coin counter body, and the link rod 80 is forced to set the eccentric pin 79 into the cutout recess 87 . The link rods 80 , 81 , 82 , and t83j are respectively forced in one direction under the upward forcing of the link rod 80 by the coil spring 71 , and are mutually axially connected to permit the roll 89 axially fitted to one end of the link rod 83 to be in pressure contact with the outer cam surfaces of the denomination cam 51 and the thickness adjusting cam 55 . Accordingly, the denomination cam 51 and the thickness adjusting cam 55 are operated in accordance with the kind of the coin to be counted, the rotary disk 2 is driven by energizing the motor not shown in accordance with the procedures similar to those of the foregoing embodiments, the endless belt 53 is run, and under the operating condition many coins to be counted are charged into the hopper 1 to feed the coins to be counted. The coins charged into the hopper 1 drop through the controller 3 , and are received on the rotary disk. The coins on the lowest position in contact with the rotary disk 2 are. subjected to centrifugal force by the rotation of the rotary disk 2 , and slid toward the sorting ring 4 . At this time, the coins slide outward through the gap between the rotary disk 2 and the controller . Thus, the coins can be slid under the condition placed in layers not more than the number of pieces to be laid determined by the gap between the rotary disk 2 and the controller 3 or under the condition not accumulated in layers at all. The coins which have slid outward from the controller 3 are led to the position between the rotary disk 2 and the control plate 101 . Accordingly, of the coins which have slid from the controller 3 under the condition of accumulation in plural pieces, only the coin on the lowest position is slid through the gap between the rotary disk 2 and the control plate 101 until it comes into contact with the sorting ring 4 . The succeeding coin is slid until it comes into contact with the coin adjacent to the sorting ring 4 . The above operations are repeated hereafter to align the coins in the gap between the rotary disk 2 and the control plate 101 . The foregoing explanations have been given on the actions of the case where the coins are aligned piece by piece in the gap between the rotary disk 2 and the control plate 101 . However, since the coins inside the controller 3 are to slide outward continuously and each coin is subjected to relatively large centrifugal force in sliding, the succeeding coin is to be brought into strong collision with the preceding coin, and usually the succeeding coin is to hold up the preceding coin and advance under it.Moreover, since the spring force of the coil spring 104 which forces the control plate 101 downward is made small, the succeeding coin holds up the preceding coin together with the control plate 101 to advance thereunder, and alignment is formed under the condition where more than two pieces of coin are laid in the gap between the rotary disk 2 and the control plate 101 . In such a case, by means of the spring force of the compressed coil spring 104 the coins are to be pressed on the upper surface of the rotary disk 2 by the spring force of the compressed coil spring 104 .However, since the spring force is small, there is no case for the continuation of rotationof the rotary disk 2 to be interrupted thereby. Further, it may be so designed that, when more than three pieces of coin are accumulated in layers, the intermediate coin is caused to slip out under the rotation of the rotary disk 2 , so that the number of accumulation of the coin may be made not exceeding two pieces. Even when more than two pieces of coin are cumulatively laid between the rotary disk 2 and the control plate 101 , the coins to be fed to the sorting course 5 are to become piece by piece. Therefore, there is no case of trouble in the coin feeding action to occur.In other words, in this embodiment, it is possible to dissolve any risk for a number of coins to be laid in layers in the gap between the rotary disk 2 and the control plate 101 and make the coins to be laid in layers not to exceed two pieces, so that the coin counting performance and the coin sorting performance can be remarkably improved in comparison with the foregoing embodiments. With regard to the relation between the diameter and the thickness of the coin, it is usual that when the larger the diameter is, the larger the thickness is. However, depending on country, there may exist. a coin having a larger thickness even with a smaller diameter. Accordingly, in such case as above, the operations of setting the denomination cam 51 and thickness adjusting cam 55 in coordination with the coin of the largest diameter, levelling up the eccentric pin 79i mediated by the link rods 83 , 82 , 81 and 80 , levelling up the small sorting ring 7 , and setting the coin path gap 76 to the size of the largest diameter coin are still unsatisfactory to lead all the coins to the sorting course 5 . However, this embodiment can cope with the case as above. By operating the operating knob 91 the fine adjustment cam 90 is rotated and the lower portion of the upper end cam surfaces 94 is engaged with the pin 92 , upon which the fitting plate 78 is lowered, the small sorting. ring 7 is raised, and the coin path gap 76 is widened, so that it becomes possible to send the coins of irregular sizes having small diameter and large thickness to the sorting course 5 . And, these coins, while rotating together with the rotary disk 2 , are fed piece by piece to the sorting course 5 through the coin path gap 76 formed by the small sorting ring 7 , the coins of the largest diameter to be counted are advanced by the endless belt 53 , dropped into the sorted coin container bag 61j through the sorted coin guide metal 6 . Other coins of smaller diameters are let fall through the gap between the guide plates 51 51 which constitute the sorting course 5 and fed into other coin sorter or collected.
