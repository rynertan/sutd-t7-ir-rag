## Description
APPARATUS FOR MON ITOXINE RESPIRATION OF A SUBJECTThis invention relates to an apparatus for monitiring the respiration of a subject such as a person. Said apparatus comprises an electric circuit including means for providing .electric signals in reponse to movements of respiration, i.e. . body movements caused by the respiration, and a sensing unit for these signals. The invention is particularly concerned with an apparatus of the above mentioned kind for cmntinous monitoring of the respiration of an infant.Every year infants die in so called sudden infant death sum due to the fact that the respiration often for unknown reasons ceases. The course is accute and leads, if untreated, to death already within a few seconds.The need for an effective and reliable apparatus for monitoring the respiration of in particular an infant is therefor great.An object of the invention is thus to provide such an apparatus, and this object is achieved in accordance with the invention by means of an apparatus as defined in the accompanying claims.In accordance with the invention is thus provided an apparatus for continous monitoring of the respiration of a subject, in particular an infant, comprising an electric circuit including means for providing electric signals in response to respiration movements of the subject, and a sensing unit for said signals.This apparatus is characterized in that said means comprises an elastic or flexible leader element which is adapted to receive said movements, whwreby said electric signals in the circuit are created through resistance alterations in the so influenced element. .. .. The expression adapted to receive said movements as regards the leader element means that said element is adapted to resiliently expand an contract, respectively, under influence from the respiration movements. This necessarily means that the elastic ir lexible leader element should be in contact with the monitored subject in such a way that the mechanical transerring of the said movements to the element is secured when the apparatus is in use.In accordance with a simple embodiment of the invention, said elastic or flexible leader element may be in form of a thin thread or a similar elongated member, e.g, a narrow strip, adapted to be located around the body of the subject to be monitored, preferably around the chest thereof.A cheap and effective elongated leader element may be a thin rubber thread, such as silicon, comprising embedded therein an electrically leading material such as carbon particles.The invention is however not restricted as regards the choice of material for the said leader element, other than that the material which is chosen shall be elastic or flexible and electrically leading.Conveniently, said leader element is provided with a clasping device for releasable clasping and retaining of the element in place around the monitored subject,In accordance with a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention the sensing unit is connectable to an alarm device which is adapted to yield an alarm visible and or audible when the electric signals sensed by the sensing device have ceased or strongly weakened. Preferably, said sensing device is connectable to such an alarm device via a micro processor which in advance may be programmed to activate the alatm when a certain optional time has elapsed since ceasing or strong weakening of the electric signals.In connection with infants, which naturally show an alternating respiration rhthm with from some up to ten seconds of spaces between consecutive respirations the microprocessor may be rotira ced suci thc t it will not activate the alarm device until for example about 10 s have passed since the sensing gt IV device sensed the previous electric signal. Thereby, false alarms every time the monitored infant makes a natural breathing space are avoided.A compact and easily handled apparatus is provided in accordance with the invention when the sensing unit, icro processor, and alarm device are hosed within one and same housing, for example a plastic box of the size of a match box, fitted with contact members for electric connection to the separate leader elemente within the said hosing or plastic box may be incorporated a battery, preferably a rechargable battery, whereby the hosing or plastic box preferably comprises a corresponding contact member for connection with a recharging device for the battery.The present invention will be further described in the following with reference to the accompanying drawing illustrating the use of the present apparatus according to a preferred embodiment.As shown in the drawing, the present apparatus preferably comprises an elastic or flexible leader element in form of a thin about 1 mm thread which may be manufactured from for example silicon rubber having electrically particles of carbon embedded therein.The thread 1 is adapted to be located around the chest of the subject to be monitored, such as an infant 2, to receive i.e, to alternatingly expand an contract respiratory movements and to provide electric signals in response to the so received movements, as explained hereinabove.The thread 1 is further provided with a clasp 3 by means of which the thread 1 releasably, yet safetely, is maintained in place around the body, preferably around the chest, as shown. Finally, the thread 1 is through a leader 4 connectable to a contacting member 5 of a plastic box 6 for connection with a not shown sensing unit located within said box 6 for receiving the electric signals from the thread 1.The plastic box 6 further houses an alarm device 7 and 8, a not shown micro circuit, and a rechargable battery not shown which is adapted to f feed the thread 1 with an electric current.The said micro circuit in the plastic box 6 is in advance so set, that it will activate an alarm loud speaker 7 and lamp 8 of the alarm device, when a predetermined time, for example 10 s, has elapsed since the previous electric signal from the thread was received, as explained above.
