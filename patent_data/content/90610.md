# A method for treatment of mutagens.

## Abstract
Mutagenic substances in solutions are selectively ad sorbed by specific solid adsorbents bearing covalently bound phthalocyanine derivatives. The adsorbents are prepared by coupling the organic solid materials, for instance, cotton and cellulose powder, with phthalocyanine derivatives having chemically reactive terminal groups. Such reactive phthalo cyanines are commercially available as phthalocyanine reac tive dyes.
