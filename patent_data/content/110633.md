## Description
SILVER HALIDE PHOTOGRAPHIC LIGHT SENSITIVE MATERIAL DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a silver halide photographic light sensitive material, and more particularly to a silver halide photographic light sensitive material having improved graininess and,excellent sharpness. It has hitherto been known that DIR compounds may be used as one of the techniques for improving the graininess and sharpness of photographic images. The above DIR compound reacts with the oxidized product of a color developing agent to release imagewise a development inhibitor to inhibit the silver development, thereby preventing possible enormous growth of dye cloud and improving the graininess.This tech unique was very useful means for such light sensitive materials as 110 size or 35mm size films, but for such films of the further smaller image frame size as the recent disc film, because it requires a much larger magnification in making enlarged photographic prints , so that the use of the above DIR compound alone is not enough for improving the image quality, and thus coarse graininess becomes conspicuous in the resulting pints. In contrast to this, a method for improving the graini nests by use of a nondiffusible coupler capable of producing a movable dye is recently disclosed in Japanese Patent Pub cation Open to Public Inspection hereinafter referred to asJapanese Patent O.P.I. Publication No.82837 1982. The tech nique in this method, as described in the publication, shows an improving effect upon the graininess but does not come up to the Improvement on the sharpness The above technique is therefore desirable to be utilized in a layer for producing an yellow dye, to which color the naked eye is less sensitive, so that the technique lacks the actual improvement effect on the graininess of a photographic image that is easily distinguishable by the naked eye. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a silver halide photographic light sensitive material which is capable of making up for the above disadvantages, and of forming a photographic image excellent not only in the graininess but also in the sharpness. As a result of our continued various investigations, it has now been found that the above object can be accomplished by the following silver halide photographic light s ens itive material comprising a support having thereon plural silver halide emulsion layer which are respectively different in speed but have the sensitivity thereof in the same spectral region and at least one light sensitive layer comprising a non diffusible coupler capable of forming non diffusible dye by the reaction thereof with a oxidized product of a color developing agent, wherein the silver halide emulsion layer having highest speed among said plural silver halide emulsion layers contains a non diffusible coupler capable of producing a movable dye by the reaction thereof with the oxidized product of a color developing agent and a ncn diffusible compound capable of releasing a development by the reaction thereof with the oxidized product of a color developing agent. Namely, the present invention is characterized by such a silver halide photographic light sensitive material as corn prising not less than two emulsion layers differing in the speed but having the sensitivity thereof to the same spectral region and containing Åa nondiffusible dye formable nondiffusible coupler, of which emulsion layers the highest speed having silver halide emulsion layer contains a movable dye pro ducible nondiffusible coupler and a development inhibitor releasable nondiffusible compound. And by the use of such a lisht sensitive material as having the above construction, even in the case of miniaturized film like the previously mentioned disc film, not only the graininess but also the sharp ness can be improved. The. present invention will be illustrated further in detail below The light sensitive material of the present invention, if it is of a multilayer construction, is prepared by coating on a support in order from the support side red sensitive, green sensitive and blue sensitive emulsion layers, and when dividing one of these layers or all the layers each into silver halide emulsion layers differing in the speed, the layer closer to the support is made to be the lower layer. The aforesaid nondiffusible coupler capable of producing a movable dye by the reaction thereof with the oxidized product of a color developing agent and contained in the highest speed emulsion layer of the silver halide photographic lightsensitive material constructed like above according to the present invention can be broadly classified into two types of compounds one is a group of slightly movable dye producible nondiffusible couplers and the other a group of completely dif fusible dye producible nondiffusible couplers. The expression, slightly movable used herein means being movable within the layer containing the movable dye producible nondiffusible coupler, and the expression, completely diffusible means that the produced dye diffuses from the layer containinc the above nondiffusible coupler to the adjacent layers. And the effect by the former coupler is such that the dye produced by the reaction of the coupler with the oxidized product of a color developing agent slightly moves during a processing to spread thinly the dye cloud to thereby improve the graininess, and at the same time the spread of the dye cloud is controlled to an appropriate extent by a compound which, as will be described hereinafter, releases a development inhibitor material by the above exidized product the compound is hereinafter called DIR compound to thereby improve the sharpness. The DIR compound, which will be described in detail hereinafter, as is generally known, is one that performs a coupling reaction with the oxidized product of a color developing agent during a color developing process, thereby releasing a development inhibitor material. The thus released development inhibitor material may be a compound that spreads at least into not only the DIR corn pound containing emulsion layer but also the layer adjacent thereto and belongs to the so called diffusible compound.Accordingly, the action of the above mentioned development inhibitor material, without staying in a same layer, comes up to the adjacent layers. upon this, when the dye produced from the nondiffusible coupler of the present invention is slightly movable as described above, the graininess can be improved by thinly spreading the dye cloud as above mentioned, and at the same time the spread of. the dye cloud can be controlled to an appropriate extent by the above development control action, and the sharpness can be improved as well.And when the dye produced from the nondiffusible coupler of the invention is completely diffusible, the dye cloud, with further increasing its spread, extends to the adjacent layers, and, when using a mordant as will be described hereinafter, is finally fixed by the mordant, but, during the process, the above dye clouds spread is appropriately controlled by the development inhibiting action of the above diffusible development inhibitor mate rival, whereby the sharpness as well as the graininess can be improved as described above. The above mentioned mordant will be described in detail hereinafter. The movable dye producible nondiffusible coupler in the present invention has in the coupling position thereof a stabilizing group for rendering the coupler immovable and nondiffusible and in the noncoupling position thereof a control group for controlling the moving degree of the produced dye.When the above coupler couples with the oxidized product of a color developing agent, the stabilizing group is split from the coupler, and the thereby produced dye becomes movable.The moving degree of the movable dye can be controlled by the control group f or example, in one most extreme case, thw Se is controlled to become a slightly movable, and in the other most extreme case, it is controlled to become a completely dif fusible dye. Such the control group depends on the couplerss mother nucleus, another substituent introduced into the coupler, and the color developing agent used. Even if it is the same substituent, the control group, in the case of one certain coupler, may render the produced dye completely diffusible, and in the case of another, may render the produced dye slightly movable. The above described movable dye reproducible nondiffusible coupler for the present invention has the formula Formula I COUP control group stabilizing group wherein COUP represents a coupler component for producing a dye, and the stabilizing group is a group that is linked to the above coupler component in the coupling position thereof and can be split from COUP during the coupling reaction between the coupler and the oxidized product of a color developing agent. And the above stabilizing group has such molecular size as enough for rendering the coupler non diffusible. The control group is a group that is linked to COUP in the noncoupling position thereof and so controls the dye produced by the coupling reaction of the coupler with the oxidized product of a color developing agent as to become slightly movable as previously described or completely diffusible. The above COUP represents the coupler component and produces a dye by the reaction thereof with the oxidized product of a color developing agent, so that it may be any known or used coupler component to or by those skilled in the art. For example, the usable yellow dye producible coupler includes aszylanilide type acetanilides and benzoyl acetanilides the magenta dye producible coupler includes pyrazolones, pyrazolotriazoles, pyrazolobenziinidazoles and ind azolones and further the cyan dye producible coupler includes phenols and naphthols. These couplers each is capable of pro ducing the coupler portion COUP. The aforesaid stabilizing group has sufficient molecular size and form for rendering the coupler nondiffusible. The useful stabilizing group of the kind includes groups having alkyl components and aryl components having not less than 8 carbon atoms, and preferably from S to 32 carbon atoms. The stabilizing group may be one that is substituted by such a group as capable of changing the reactivity of the coupler, and may also have a cross linking group in the coupling posi tion thereof. Those typical cross linking groups oA the kind include, e.g., O , S , N N ,EMI8.1 wherein Z is a group of atoms necessary to form a 5 or 7 member heterocyclic group afld the like.Those preferred stabilizing groups include 8 to 32 carbon atoms having alkoxy, aryloxy, alkyloxy, arylthio and nitrongen containing heterocyclic groups. The foregoing control group, in one extreme case, is a group having molecular size and form suitable for rendering the produced dye slightly movable and, in the other extreme case, is an alkali soluble group capable of rendering the dye completely diffusible. Those preferred as the above group suitable for rendering the dye slightly movable are alkyl groups having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms and aryl groups hav ing from 6 to 20 carbon atoms. These groups are allowed to be further substituted by a group capable of changing the spectral characteristic and diffusibility of the dye.These control groups are also allowed to have a cross linking group for linking the same to the coupler s mother nucleus, the crosslingking group including, e.g., O , S , CO , COO , NR , CONR , NRCO , SO2NR , NR502 , NRCONR wherein R is a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group or an aryl group , and the like. The alkali soluble group rendering the dye completely diffusible, on the other hand, is a group capable of being ionized under a processing condition, and is a group containing, e.g., a hydroxy group, a carboxylic acid group, a sulfonic acid group, or an aminosulfonyl group, and not less than one salt thereof. These groups also are allowed to be ones having a cross linking group for linking the group to the coupler s mother nucleus, the cross linking group being typified by, e.g., o , S , cO , COO , NR , COI4R , sRco SO2NR , NRSO2 , NRCONR wherein R is a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group or aryl group , and the like.

Publication Nos.10135 1975 and 123341 1975. In order to improve the photographic characteristics, the photographic light sensitive material may also contain a colorless dye formable coupler, the so called competing coupler. The silver halide photographic emulsion for use in the present invention comprises a hydrophilic macromolecular material such as gelatin into which is dispersed in the colloidal particle form silver chloride, silver bromide, silver chlorobromide, silver chloroiodide, silver iodobromide, or silver chloroiodobromide, which may be prepared in various manners. The above silver halide photographic emulsion can be sensitized by chemical sensitizers of the prior art, which include noble metallic sensitizers, sulfur sensitizers, selenium sensitizers, and reduction sensitizers, which may be. used singly or in combination. Further, the silver halide photographic emulsion of the present invention may, if necessary, be spectrally sensitized by use of sensitizing dyes of the prior art. It may be desirable for displaying sufficiently the ef fect of the present invention to use in the light sensitive silver halide emulsion layer or the hydrophilic colloidal layer adjacent thereto by incorporating in combination a reducing agent or oxidation inhibitor including, e.g., sulfites sodium sulfite, potassium sulfite, etc , hydrogensulfites sodium hydrogensulfite, potassium hydrogensulfite, etc. , hydroxylamines hydroxylamine, N methyl hydroxylamine, etc. , sulfinates sodium phenyl sulfinate, etc. , hydrazines N,N dimethyl hydrazine, etc. , reductones ascorbic acid, etc. , aromatic hydrocarbons having at least one hydroxyl group paminophenol, gallic acid, catechol, pyrogallol, resorcinol, 2,3 dihydroxynaphthalene, etc. , and the like. Further, in order to improve the light resistance of the magenta dye image formed from the magenta coupler used in the present invention, there may be incorporated into the emulsion layer or the adjacent layers thereto p alkoxyphenols or phenolic compounds. The construction of the silver halide color photographic light sensitive material of the present invention may be on the basis of the subtractive color process. As a ruler the fundamental construction of the material is comprised principally of three layers a blue sensitive layer containing an yellow coupler for the formation of an yellow dye, 2 greensensitive layer containing a magenta coupler for the formation of a magenta dye, and a red sensitive layer containing a cyan coupler for the formation of a cyan dye. Further, at least one of these three layers or all the layers each is desirable to be composed of two or three superposed layers to thereby improve such photographic characteristics as the color forming characteristic, color reproductions, graininess of the color formed dyes, and the like. In addition to these fundamental emulsion layers, there may be appropriately used a protective layer as the topmost layer, interlayers and filter layers between the emulsion layerr, subbing layer as the bottom layer, and further an antihalation layer to thereby enable to improve the protection, prevention of color stain, graininess, color reproductions, layer adhesiveness of the light sensitive material. These emulsion layers and other layers are coated by any of known methods on an appropriate support material such as laminated paper, cellulose acetate, polystyrene, or the like. In order to prevent possible deterioration of the speed or occurrence of fog during the manufacture, storage, or processing of the color light sensitive material, to the silver halide emulsion may be added various compounds including such a heterocyclic compound as, e.g., l phenyl 5 mercaptotetrazole, 3 methyl benzothiazole, 4 hydroxy 6 methyl 1 ,3,3a, 7 tetraza indene, etc., a mercapto compound, a metallic salt, and the like. And the emulsion may be subjected to a hardening treatment in accordance with a usual manner. To the above silver halide emulsion may be added a single surfactant or a mixture of surfactants. As the surfactant, there may be used various active agents as coating aid, emulsifying agent, improving agent for the permeability of processing liquids into the emulsion, deforming agent, antistatic agent, anti adhesion agent, or for improving the photographic characteristics or controlling the physical property of the emulsion. In the silver halide photographic light sensitive material of the present invention, in order to prevent possible occurrence of unnecessary fog or stain due to the air oxida tion of an aromatic primary amino developing agent or to prevent possible diffusion of the oxidized product of the color developing agent into the adjacent layers during processing, it is advantageous to use in the silver halide emulsion layers or interlayers those alkyl substituted hydroguinone compounds as desclosed in U.S Patent Nos.2,728,659, 2,732,300 and 3,700,453, and Japanese Patent O.P.I.

On the other hand, Sample 3 also was prepared in quite the same manner as in Sample 1 with the exception that an yellow coupler lithe following Compound 2 was used in place of the Exemplified Coupler C 3 of the high speed blue sensitive emulsion layer, and the mordant layer was excluded. Sample 3 also was prepared in the same manner as inSample 2 except that following yellow Compound 2 was used in place of Exemplified Coupler C 3 . The above Exemplified Coupler C 3 is a diffusible dyeproducible coupler, while the coupler as the following Compound 2 and other couplers used in Samples 1 to 3 are all nondiffusible dye producible couplers. The reason that the quantity of the silver halide was reduced in Sample 2 is because all the samples should be adjusted so as to indicate almost equal characteristic curves.

And the measured results are given in Table 1 in the normalized granularities n obtained at densities 1.2 and 2.3. The normalized granularity can be obtained by first subtracting from the density of the masking colored coupler in the film the contribution to the above density, and then by dividing the RMS granularity by the subtracted density. On the other hand, each of Samples 1 to 3 was exposed so that its density becomes 1.8 to soft X rays through a wedge having spatial frequencies varied in the range of from 3 lines mm to 100 lines inin, and processed in the sane manner as previously described The obtained color image was used to obtain MTF Modulation Transfer Function using a blue light.The resulting MTF values under the spatial frequency condition of 30 lines nm are as given in Table 1. The MTF value is obtained by the density measurement made through a slitter with the dimensions of 300 microns by 2 microns, and shown in percentage of the output to the input. In addition, the speed values given in Table 1 are each represented by the relative speed to the speed of Sample 1 regarded as 100.
