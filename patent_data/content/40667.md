# Tire security cap.

## Abstract
The cap is provided for the purpose of enabling one to detect whether a specific wheel has been removed from an automobile. The cap assembly comprises a shroud 20 and a sleeve 21 , to which is initially attached a breakaway nut 28 . Skirt 22 of shroud 20 slips over lug nut 12 , which secures the wheel to the car axle. It is held in place by sleeve 21 , which is internally threaded 26 to engage the exposed threads of lug 11 . When sleeve 21 is tightened on to lug 11 , nut 28 breaks off. Shroud 20 , which is made of frangible material, must be broken away to remove lug nut 12 .
