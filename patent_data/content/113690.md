# Apparatus for the control of an aerial propeller.

## Abstract
Apparatus for controlling the pitch of the blades of a variable pitch, governor controlled, aerial propeller of which the pitch of the blades is variable between a coarse pitch limit and a fine pitch limit to match the torque of its prime mover has holding means A to maintain a forward thrust generating blade pitch angle greater than the fine pitch limit with the prime mover idling as when an aircraft propelled by the propeller is taxi ing whereby the propeller rotates more slowly, and hence more quietly, than it would otherwise. Preferably the holding means is effective by actuating a lock pitch solenoid valve 21 and an autofeather valve 18 .
