# CYCLE DERAILLEUR AND USE THEREOF

## Abstract
This invention relates to a cycle derailleur for use in switching a drive chain C from one sprocket to another of a multi stage sprocket assembly S attached to a cycle, said derailleur comprising a base member 1 a support member 2 mounted on said base member 1 a pair of linkage members 4,5 each pivotally connected at one end to said support member 2 and at its other end to a movable member 6 and a chain guide 7 connected to said movable member 6 said chain guide 7 being movable generally axially of said multi stage sprocket assembly S with respect to said base member 1. In such a derailleur adjustment of the chain guide for align ment of a high or low speed sprocket results in misalignment for the other sprockets. According to the present invention an adjusting mechan ism A is provided for moving said chain guide 7 generally axially of said multi stage sprocket assembly S with respect to said base member 1 thereby to adjust the position of said chain guide 7 with respect to said base member 1, said adjust ing mechanism A having a securing means 10 for fixing said chain guide 7 in a given position to which it has been adjusted by said adjusting mechanism A.
