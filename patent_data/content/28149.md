# Apparatus and method for treating an aggregate material with a flowing gas.

## Abstract
Aggregate directed into a rotary kiln 12 is preheated continuously and in a highly effective manner by directing the aggregate downwardly along a passageway 35 formed by a pair of gas permeable retaining walls 36 which extend generally vertically in opposing spaced relation to one another. The retaining walls 36 are of a zigzag configura tion so arranged as to direct the thin layer of aggregate along a sinuous path of travel in the course of its downward movement along the passageway 35 as heated gas from the kiln 12 is directed through the retaining walls 36 guiding the aggregate.
