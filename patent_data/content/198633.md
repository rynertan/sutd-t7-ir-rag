## Abstract
The present invention provides compounds of formula 1 CHEM and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts. In formula 1 R 1 and R 2 are the same or different and are hydrogen, C1 6alkyl, C1 6alkoxy or halogen R 3 is C1 6alkyl or optionally substituted phenyl or optionally substituted pyridyl, where the optional substituents are one or more C1 6alkyl, C1 6alkoxy, or hydroxy or halogen atoms a is from 2 to 4 R 4 is CH2 bR 5 where b is 1 6 and R 5 is phenyl optionally substituted by one or more C1 6alkyl, C1 6alkoxy, hydroxy, carboxy or an ester thereof or sulphonamido groups or halogen atoms pyridyl optionally substituted by one or more C1 6alkyl, C1 6alkoxy or hydroxy groups or halogen atoms or N oxo pryidyl optionally substituted by C1 6alkyl and r is 1 or 2.
