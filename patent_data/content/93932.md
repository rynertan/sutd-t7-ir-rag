# Device for eliminating static electricity.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a device, which entirely elim inates static electricity on technical equipment and charged materials. This is effected by using an electric circuit be tween charging media and machine part, which circuit com prises in series at least one resistor 2 , one tunnel diode 3 and one coupling diode 4 . A capacitor 5 is connected in parallel over the tunnel diode, and a direct voltage is laid over the resistor 2 and the tunnel diode 3 .
