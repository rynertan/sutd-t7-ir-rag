## Description
A PROCESS FOR PREPARING ETHYLENE COPOLYMERS This invention relates to a process for preparing a copolymer of a predominant amount of ethylene and a minor amount of an a olefin containing at least three carbons. More particularly, the invention relates to a process for preparing ethylene copolymers, by which low density ethylene copolymers having densities in 3 the order of not higher than 0.945 g cm , for example, can be produced with industrial advantage, assisted by excellent activity and effectiveness of the catalyst, without the need of pre polymerization treatment of the titanium containing catalyst component. That is, the invention relates to a process for preparing ethylene copolymers which comprises copolymerizing a predominant amount of ethylene with a minor amount of an a olefin of at least 3 carbon atoms, in the presence of a catalyst composed of A a non prepolymerization treated titanium catalyst component obtained by treating a solid titanium composition a containing at least magnesium, titanium and halogen and optionally containing less than 2 mols of an electron donor per gram atom of titanium, with 0.1 to tO mols, of an organoaluminum compound b per gram atom of titanium atom in said composition a , the halogen aluminum atomic ratio in said compound b being not more than 1, and B an organoaluminum compound catalyst component. It is known to polymerize or copolymerize ethylene, in the presence of a catalyst composed of a solid titanium composition a containing at least magnesium, titanium and halogen and optionally containing an electron donor, used as the titanium containing catalyst component, and an organoaluminum compound catalyst component B . e.g. U.S. Patent No. 3,888,835,U.S. Patent No. 3,644,318, British Patent No. 1,275,641 and German Laid Opcn Patent Application No. 2,365,235. Generally in case of producing high density ethylene polymers or copolymers through slurry polymerization in an inert solvent, the products having high bulk densities can be obtained in high yields the yields of solid polymers to the consumed ethylene . In the attempts to prepare low density ethylene copolymers, such as those having the density of not higher than 0.945 g cm3, by the copolymerization of a predominant amount of ethylene with a minor amount of an a olefin having at least 3 carbon atoms, various troubles take place, and frequently satisfactory results could not be obtained.For example, copolymers having sufficiently high bulk density are hardly obtained an innegligible amount of the inert solvent soluble copolymer is formed to reduce the yield of solid copolymer to the consumed ethylene and low density copolymers are hardly formed due to low copolymerizability of a olefins. Thus, solving of those troubles became an important technical problem. With the view to improve such troubles and to perform the slurry polymerization smoothly, it has been proposed to add a prepolymerization step, that is, a minor amount of ethylene or a olefin is prepolymerized at relatively low temperatures in the presence of a catalyst composed of the solid titanium composition a serving as the titanium catalyst component, in combination with an organoaluminum catalyst component B1, and the resulting prepolymerization treated titanium catalyst component is used to form a catalyst system in combination with the organoaluminum compound containing catalyst component B . This catalyst system then is used in the intended polymerization or copolymerization, performed at higher temperatures. Such a practice is known from, for example, U.S. Patent No. 4,128,607 andU.S.Patent No. 4,190,614. We have engaged in the research works, aiming at the development of a process for producing the desired low density ethylene copolymers without the additional pre polymerization treatment as described above, yet overcoming the various troubles occurring in the copolymerization of a predominant amount of ethylene with a minor amount of an a olefin having at least three carbon atoms. As the result, we discovered that it is possible to produce, with industrial advantage, low density ethylene copolymers freely from aforesaid troubles, under excellent catalytic effectiveness or activity, and without the additional step of subjecting the solid titanium composition a to a prepolymerization treatment, if a non prepolymerization treated titanium containing catalyst component Al, which is obtained by treating a solid titanium composition a containing at least magnesium, titanium and halogen and optionally containing less than 2 mols of an electron donor per gram atom of titanium atom that is, containing from zero to less than 2 mols of an electron donor with 0.1 to 10 mols, per gram atom of titanium atom. in said composition a , of an organoaluminum compound b , the halogen aluminum atomic ratio in said compound b being not more than 1, preferably not more than 0.5, is used as the catalyst, in combination with an organoaluminum compound catalyst component B , in the copolymerization of a predominant amount of ethylene with a minor amount of an a olefin having at least 3 carbon atoms. It is also found that the intended improvement can be advantageously achieved, upon adopting the combined requirements that, as said organoaluminum compound b , such a compound in which the halogen aluminum atomic ratio is not more than 1, preferably not more than 0.5, is selected, and that it is used in the amount corresponding to 0.1 to 10 mols per gram atom of titanium in the composition a . Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide an improved process for preparing ethylene copolymers. The above object and many other objects and advantages of this invention will become clearer from the following descriptions. The titanium composition a serving as the starting material of the titanium catalyst component zeal is a solid compound containing at least magnesium, titanium and halogen, which optionally contains less than 2 mols per gram atom of titanium of an electron donor. Such titanium composition a contains magnesium halide of lower degree of crystallinity than that of commercial magnesium halide, and normally has a specific surface area of at least about 3 m2 g, preferably about 10 to about 1000 m2 g, particularly about 40 to about 800 m2 g. Its composition undergoes substantially no change when washed with hexane at room temperature.In said titanium composition a , titanium is normally tetravalent, the halogen titanium atomic ratio ranges from about 5 to about 200, preferably from about 5 to about 100, and the magnesium titanium atomic ratio ranges from about 2 to 100, preferably from about 4 to about 50. The titanium composition a preferably contains a small amount of an electron donor, such as about 0.05 to less than 2 mols, preferably about 0.1 to less than 2 mols, per gram atom of titanium. Said composition a may also contain other metals, elements, functional groups and the like.Particularly the composition a containing alkoxyl or aryloxyl group at the ratio of, for example, about 0.05 to 4 equivalents per gram atom of titanium is preferred.When such a composition a is used, the improving effect of this invention often becomes all the more conspicuous. The composition a preferably has the average perticle diameters ranging from about 1 to about 100 microns, preferably with a narrow particle size distribution. Such a titanium composition a can be obtained, for example, by mutually contacting a magnesium compound or magnesium metal with a titanium compound, and further with an electron donor, if desired. Other reaction reagent, such as a compound of silicon aluminum or the like may also be employed as occasion demands. Methods for producing such titanium composition a are known, and useful for the present invention.

Some of those methods forming titanium composition a forming methods will be briefly described hereinbelow. 1 A solid described in the following i to iii is reacted with a titanium compound which is liquid under the reaction conditions i a magnesium compound or a complex of the magnesium compound and an electron donor. ii a solid product obtained by pulverizing a magnesium compound or a complex of the magnesium compound and an electron donor in the presence or absence of an electron donor and or a pulverization aid. iii a solid product obtained by treating a solid of above i or ii with a com pound such as an electron donor, an organoaluminum compound, a halogen containing silicon compound and a mixture thereof. 2 A magnesium compound in the liquid state having no reducing ability is reacted with a titanium compound in the liquid state in the optional presence of an electron donor, to cause precipitation of a solid titanium composition. 3 The product of 2 above is further reacted with a titanium compound. 4 The product of 1 or 2 is reacted with an electron donor and a titanium compound. 5 The product of any one of 1 to 4 is treated with halogen or a halogen compound.

In above compounds, an alkoxyl group has preferably 1 to 20 carbon atoms, more preferably 1 to 12 carbon atoms, and an aryloxyl group has preferably 6 to 20 carbon atoms, more preferably 6 to 12 carbon atoms. In the preparation of the titanium composition a , for example, the organoaluminum compound which may be used in the embodiment 1 above can be suitably selected from the later described organoaluminum compound catalyst component B . Furthermore, as the halogen containing silicone compound which may be used for preparing the titanium composition a according to the embodiment 1 above, for example, silicone tetrahalides, silicon alkoxyhalides, silicon alkylhalides and halopolysiloxanes may be named. Examples of the titanium compounds useful for preparing the titanium composition a include titanium tetrahalides, alkoxytitanium halides, aryloxytitanium halides, alkoxytitaniums and aryloxytitaniums. Of those, titanium tetrahalide, particularly titanium tetrachloride, is preferred. In above examples, an alkyl group has preferably 1 to 20 carbon atoms, more preferably 1 to 8 carbon atoms, an alkoxyl group has preferably 1 to 20 carbon atoms, more preferably 1 to 12 carbon atoms, and an aryloxyl group has preferably 6 to 20 carbon atoms, more preferably 6 to 12 carbon atoms. Also the examples of electron donors useful for preparing the titanium composition a include oxygen containing electron donors such as alcohols, phenols, ketones, aldehydes, carboxylic acids, esters of organic acids inorganic acids, ethers, acid amides and acid anhydrides and nitrogen containing electron donors such as ammonia, amines, nitriles and isocyanates. More specifically, for example, C1 C18 alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, pentanol, hexanol, octanol, dodecanol, octadecyl alcohol, benzyl alcohol, phenylethyl alcohol, cumyl alcohol and isopropylbenzyl alcohol C6 C25 phenols which may contain alkyl groups, such as phenol, cresol, xylenol, ethyl phenol, propyl phenol, cumyl phenol, nonyl phenol and naphthol C3 C15 ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, acetophenone and benzophenone C2 C15 aldehydes such as acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde, octylaldehyde, benzaldehyde, tolualdehyde and naphthaldehyde C2 C20 organic acid esters such as methyl formate, methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, vinyl acetate, propyl acetate, octyl acetate, cyclohexyl acetate, ethyl propionate, methyl butyrate, ethyl valerate, ethyl stearate, methyl chloroacetate, ethyl dichloroacetate, methyl methacrylate, ethyl crotonate, ethyl cyclohexanecarboxylate, methyl benzoate, ethyl benzoate, propyl benzoate, butyl benzoate, octyl benzoate, cyclohexyl benzoate, phenyl benzoate, benzyl benzoate, methyl toluate, ethyl toluate, amyl toluate, ethyl ethylbenzoate, methyl anisate, ethyl anisate, ethyl ethoxybenzoate, diethyl phthalate, dibutyl phthalate, dioctyl phthalate, y butyrolactone, 6 valerolactone, cumarine, phthalide and ethylene carbonate inorganic acid esters such as ethyl silicate, butyl silicate and vinyl ethoxysilane C2 C15 acid halides such as acetyl chloride, benzoyl chloride, toluic acid chloride and anisic acid chloride C2 C20 ethers such as methyl ether, ethyl ether, isopropyl ether, butyl ether, amyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, anisole and diphenyl ether C2 C15 acid amides such as acetic amide, benzoic amide and toluic amide C1 C25 amines such as methylamine, ethylamine, diethylamine, tributylamine, piperidine, tribenzylamine, aniline, pyridine, picoline and tetramethylethylenediamine and C2 C10 nitriles such as acetonitrile, benzonitrile and tolunitrile, may be exemplified. More than one of those electron donors may be used concurrently. Again they may be used in complex form with aluminum halide or other compounds. As the halogen atoms constituting the titanium composition, fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine or their mixtures may be named. Of those, chlorine is particularly preferred. The electron donors, of which presence in the titanium composition a are desirable, are those not containing active hydrogen, such as esters of organic or inorganic acids, ethers, ketones, tertiary amines, acid halides and acid anhydrides. Particularly the esters of organic or inorganic acids and ethers are preferred, the most preferred being aromatic carboxylic acid ester and alkyl containing ethers. Typical examples of preferred aromatic carboxylic acid esters include those containing 8 to 18 carbon atoms, particularly the lower alkyl esters of benzoic acid, lower alkylbenzoic acid and lower alkoxybenzoic acid. Here the term lower denotes the carbon number of 1 to 4, preferably 1 to 2.Also the preferred alkyl group containing ethers are those containing 4 to 20 carbon atoms, such as diisoamyl ether and dibutyl ether. As already mentioned, according to the invention conspicuous effect is frequently obtained when the titanium composition a containing alkoxyl groups or aryloxyl groups is used. Such preferred compositions a can be prepared by using the alcohols or phenols as above exemplified, in the course of their production. According to the present invention, the titanium composition a as above described is treated with an organoaluminum compound b , and the resulting product is used as the titanium catalyst component A .In that procedure, the type and the amount of the organoaluminum compound b used in the treatment are important. As the organoaluminum compound b , those in which the halogen aluminum atomic ratio in the average composition is no more than 1 are necessarily used. It is preferred that the said atomic ratio should be not more than 0.5, most preferably, zero. Specific examples of such organoaluminum compound b include trialkylaluminum, the alkyl group thereof preferably containing 1 8 carbon toms, such as triethylaluminum, triisobutylaluminum, trihexylaluminum and trioctylaluminum dialkylaluminum halides of which the alkyl group preferably containin 1 4 carbon atoms, such as diethylaluminum chloride, diisobutylaluminum chloride and diethylaluminum bromide dialkylaluminum hydride of which the alkyl group preferably having 1 4 carbon atoms, such as diethylaluminum hydride and the mixtures of the foregoing.Such organoaluminum compounds may also be obtained through reactions of organomagnesium compounds or organolithium compounds with halogencontaining aluminum compounds. Of the above named, trialkylaluminum or mixtures thereof with not more than an equivalent amount of dialkylaluminum halide are preferred, as their use occasionally achieves the further improvement in not only the bulk density of the copolymers but also in the catalytic activity or in the copolymer yield.If dialkylaluminum halide alone is used, the bulk density may be improved, in certain cases at the cost of the catalytic activity or copolymer yield to a certain extent. In contrast thereto, when an organoaluminum compound containing a large volume of halogen atom, such as alkylaluminum sesquihalides or alkylaluminum dihalides is used, substantially no bulk densityimproving effect is observed, and furthermore remarkable reduction in the catalytic activity or copolymer yield takes place. Hence, use of such organoaluminum compound should be avoided. The amount of the organoaluminum compound b to be used in the treatment is, per one titanium atom in the titanium composition a , 0.1 to 10 mols, preferably about 0.5 to about 5 mols. If its amount is less than the above lower limit, a sufficient improving effect cannot be obtained. On the other hand, if it is more than the above upper limit, heavy reduction in the catalytic activity or in the performance of formed copolymer takes place. If the organoaluminum compound b is replaced with organometallic compounds of other metals, for example, organomagnesium compound alone, the effect of this invention cannot be obtained. The treatment of the titanium composition a with the above described organoaluminum compound b is performed, for example, in a liquid inert hydrocarbon solvent, preferably at the temperature not higher than about 900C. , particularly from about 400C to about 700C., for preferably from about 5 seconds to about 10 hours, particularly from about 10 seconds to about 5 hours. Examples of the liquid inert solvents used for this purpose include aliphatic hydrocarbons such as n pentane, iso pentane, n hexane, iso hexane, n heptane, n octane, iso octane, n decane, n dodecane, kerosene and liquid paraffin alicyclic hydrocarbons such as cyclopentane, methylcyclopentane, cyclohexane and methylcyclohexane aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, xylene and cymene and mixtures of the foregoing. The concentration of the titanium composition a in the inert solvent in said treatment should preferably be about 0.01 to about 500 mmols liter, calculated as titanium atom, more preferably from about 0.1 to about 200 mmols liter. It should be noted that in this treatment, concurrent presence of free titanium compound or polymerizable olefin should be avoided. In thus obtained titanium catalyst component t A of this invention, the constituting ratio of magnesium, titanium and halogen is substantially same to that in the starting titanium composition a . If an electron donor is present in the titanium composition, normally the amount of the electron donor is somewhat reduced, and addition of the aluminum compound and partial or total reduction of titanium are observed. According to the invention, an organoaluminum compound catalyst component B is used together with the titanium containing catalyst component A , to assist the copolymerization of a predominant amount of ethylene with a minor amount of an a olefin having at least 3 carbon atoms. As such organoaluminum compound catalyst component B , the compound containing in its molecule at least one A1 C bond can be utilized. For example, i organoaluminum compounds of the formula, R 1mAl OR2 H X wherein RÃ and RÃª denote hydrocarbon groups normally containing 1 to 15 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 4 carbon atoms, and may be same or different, examples of such hydrocarbon groups including alkyl, alkenyl, and aryl X stands for a halogen atom,m is a number of O m 3, n is a number of O n 3, p is a number of 0 p 3, q is a number of O q 3, and m n p q equals 3 ii and alkyl metal complex of a metal of Group I of the periodic table with aluminum, expressed by the formula, M 1A1R1 1 1 4 in which M1 stands for Li, Na or K, and R1 are the same as defined above may be used. As the organoaluminum compounds belonging to the group i above, the following may be named those expressed by the formula RÃmAl OR2 3, in which R1 and R2 are the same as defined above, and m is preferably a number of 1.5 m 3 those expressed by the formula, RÃmAlX3 m in which RÃ is the same as defined above, X is a halogen atom, and m is preferably a number of O m 3 those expressed by the formula, RlmAlH3 m in which R1 is the same as defined above, and m is preferably a number of 2 m 3 and those expressed by the formula, P 1mAl OR2 nXq in which R1 and R are the same as defined above, X is a halogen atom, O m 3, O n 3, 0 q 3, and m n q equals 3 . Specific examples of the aluminum compounds belonging to group i include trialkylaluminums such as triethylaluminum, tributylaluminum and trihexylaluminum trialkenylaluminums such as tri isoprenylaluminum dialkylaluminum alkoxides such as diethyl aluminum ethoxide and dibutylaluminum butoxide alkylaluminum sesquialkoxide such as ethylaluminum sesquiethoxide and butylaluminum sesquibutoxide partially alkoxylated alkylaluminums such as a compound having an average composition expressed as R 2 5A1 OR2 o 5 in which R and R2 are the same as defined above dialkylaluminum halide such as diethylaluminum chloride, dibutylaluminum chloride and diethylaluminum bromide alkylaluminum sesquihalide such as ethylaluminum sesquichloride, butylaluminum sesquichloride and ethylaluminum sesquibromide alkylaluminum dihalide such as ethylaluminum dichloride, propylaluminum dichloride and butylaluminum bromide dialkylaluminum hydride such as diethylaluminum hydride and dibutylaluminum hydride alkylaluminum dihydride such as ethylaluminum dihydride and propylaluminum dihydride and alkylaluminum alkoxyhalide such as ethylaluminum ethoxychloride, butylaluminum butoxychloride and ethylaluminum ethoxybromide. Also as the compounds analogous to those of group i above, such organoaluminum compounds in which more than one aluminum atoms are bonded through oxygen or nitrogen may be used, examples thereof including C2H5 2AlOAl C2H5 2, C4H9 2AlOAl C4Hg 2, and C2H5 2AlNAl C2H5 2 C6H5 Specific examples of the compounds belonging to the group ii include LiAl C2H5 4 and LiAl C7H15 4. Of those organoaluminum containing catalyst component C Bt, trialkylaluminums or mixtures of trialkylaluminums and alkylaluminum halides are preferred. In practicing the subject process, the polymerization system may contain, besides the catalyst components A and B , the electron donating component and various halogen compounds such as hydrocarbon halide silicone halide, aluminum halide and the like. According to the present invention predominant amount of ethylene and minor amount of and olefin having at least 3 carbon atoms are copolymerized. Whereupon copolymers having the ethylene content of at least about 88 mol , preferably, at least 90 ol, can be produced.As the ratio molar ratio of ethylene a olefin having at least 3 carbon atoms in the copolymerization system, for example, at least 80 20, preferably 85 15, more preferably 88 12, may be employed. Other compounds such as diene, triene and the like may be concurrently present in the copolymerization system. As the a olefins having at least 3 carbon atoms to be copolymerized with ethylene, the following may be preferred a olefins of C3 C15, such as propylene, l butene, l pentene, l hexene, l octene, l decene, 4methyl l pentene, 3 methyl l pentene and 4 ,4 dimethyl l pentene. The process of this invention can be advantageously applied particularly to the preparation of lowdensity copolymers, for example, the ethylene copolymers 3 having the density not more than 0.945 g cm3, especially from 0.900 to 0.945 g cm3. The polymerization can be performed at liquid or vapor phase. In case of liquid phase polymerization, an inert solvent such as butane, pentane, hexane, keptane, kerosene, toluene or the like may be used as the reaction medium, or the a olefin itself may be utilized as the reaction medium. In the polymerization, the titanium catalyst component A may be isolated from the mixture resulting from the treatment of the titanium composition a with an organoaluminum compound b before the use, but normally such isolation is unnecessary. Use of the mixture as it is as the component A is operationally advantageous.The amount of the titanium containing catalyst component A is normally from about 0.001 to about 1 millimol, calculated as titanium atom, particularly from about 0.005 to about 0.5 millimol, per liter of the reaction volume. Incidentally, the reaction volume denotes the volume of the liquid phase in case of liquidphase polymerization, and the volume of polymerization zone in case of vapor phase polymerization. Even when the titanium catalyst component A is the aforesaid mixture resulting from the treatment of the titanium composition a with an organoaluminum compound b and does still contain the residual organoaluminum compound b , it is nevertheless necessary to add the organoaluminum catalyst component B . It is used preferably at such a ratio that the organoaluminum compound component in the reaction system should become at least about 11 more preferably at least about 15 to about 2000, in terms of Al Ti atomic ratio . The component A is supplied to the polymerization system, either separately from the component B or as preliminarily mixed with a part or whole of the component B , in both cases without any preceding preliminary contact with ethylene and or the a olefin.When it is preliminarily mixed with the whole or part of the component B , if Al Ti atomic ratio in the mixture exceeds 10, it is preferred that the preliminary mixture should be used for the copolymerization as soon as possible. The copolymerization temperature should be not higher than the melting point of the copolymer, preferably from about 500 to about 1200C., more preferably from about 600 to about 110 C. The copolymerization pressure may range from the atmospheric pressure to about 100 kg cmÃª, particularly from about 1 to 60 kg cmÃª. The copolymerization is practiceable batchwise, semi continuously or continuously. The continuous operation is industrially advantageous. It is also possible to perform the copolymerization in more than one stage under different reaction conditions. The molecular weight of the copolymer can be suitably controlled by the addition of hydrogen. Hereinafter the present invention will be explained more specifically, as to several embodiments for practicing the subject process, as demonstrated byExamples.Example 1 Preparation of Ti composition a A 2Q glass flask was charged with 4.76g of anhydrous magnesium dichloride, 25 ml of n decane and 18.3 ml of 2 ethyl hexanol under nitrogen atmosphere, and the mixture was heated at 130 C. for 2 hours to form a homogeneous solution. To the solution 0.84 ml of ethyl benzoate was added. The homogeneous solution was then dropwisely added into 200 ml of titanium tetrachloride which had been cooled to 0 C, under stirring, over 20 minutes. Then the temperature of the system was gradually raised to 80 C., and at said temperature 1.39 ml of ethyl benzoate was added. The stirring was continued for additional 2 hours at 80 C. Thus formed solid was recovered by filtration, suspended again in 200 ml of titanium tetrachloride, and the suspension was maintained at 90 C. for 2 hours. The solid reaction product was recovered by filtration, and thoroughly washed with refined hexane until free titanium compounds became no longer detectable in the washing. This titanium composition a contained 3.4 ,0 by weight of titanium, 20.0 wt of magnesium, 59.0 by weight of chlorine, 16.6 wt of ethyl benzoate and 0.7 by weight of 2 ethylhexyl alcohol radical. The composition was spherical, having an average particle diameter of 5p.The uniformity coefficient of the composition was 1.34. The composition had a specific surface area of 216 m2 g. In the X ray diffraction analysis thereof, all the maximum peak breadth of magnesium dichloride were broad. Treatment of the Ti composition a with an aluminum compound Into a thoroughly purified n decane 50 ml , the above Ti composition a of the amount corresponding to 0.5 mg atom calculated as Ti atom was added, followed by the addition of 1.5 mmols of triethylaluminum at 200C. Thereafter the system was stirred for 120 minutes, and used for the copolymerization as it was. Copolymerization Dehydrated and refined hexane solvent 1 liter was fed into a 2 liter capacity autoclave. After thoroughly nitrogen substituting the atmosphere in the autoclave, 2.25 mmols of triethylaluminum, and successively 0.4 kg cm2 of hydrogen, were supplied into the autoclave. Then ethylene containing 6.19 by mole of l butene was fed in the amount as would make the total pressure at 7OOC. 2.5 kg cm2. Subsequently 0.015 mg atom, calculated as Ti atom, of the above prepared Ti containing catalyst component A was added. The copolymerization was performed for 2 hours at 700C, continuously feeding the ethylene l butene mixed gas of the specified composition so as to maintain the total pressure of 2.5 2 kg cm .Whereupon 3.01g of an ethylene copolymer powder having a bulk density of 0.39 g ml and a melt index MI of 0.92 dg min was obtained. The copolymer had a 3 density of0.926 g cm , and the polymer dissolved in the hexane solvent amounted 2.5 wt .Examples 2 11 The Ti composition a prepared in Example 1 was treated with an organoaluminum compound shown inTable I and used for the copolymerization under the varied conditions as set forth in Table I below.

The solid was then suspended in 30 ml of kerosene, and into which 0.02 mol of isoamyl benzoate was added dropwise, followed by stirring for one hour at 60 C. After cooling the system, 200 ml of TiCl4 was added to the system, followed by 2 hours stirring at 100 C. The supernatant portion was removed by decantation, and further 200 ml of TiC14 was added to the remaining solid portion, followed by an hour s treatment at 100 C. Thus formed solid was hotfiltered, and washed thoroughly with hot kerosene and hexane. The resulting Ti composition a contained, calculated as atoms, 2.4 by weight of Ti, 62.0 wt ofC1, 21.0 wt of Mg, 1.6 by weight of ethoxy group and 8.7 by weight of isoamyl benzoate.

The inside pressure of the system was adjusted to 10 kg cm2 G with N2. Then the cock on the SUS stainless steel tube having an inner diameter of 3 mm which had been directly connected to the autoclave and maintained at 125 0C was opened, so as to transfer the content of the autoclave into a 5 liter capacity glass flask equipped with a stirrer charged in advance with 3 liters of refined kerosene which had been cooled to 150C. The amount of the transferred liquid was 1 liter, and the time required for the operation was approximately 20 seconds. The formed solid was recovered by decantation and thoroughly washed with hexane to provide the intended carrier. A microscopic observation of the solid revealed that the product was truly spherical. Preparation of the Ti composition a A 300 ml glass flask was charged with 150 ml of TiCl4, and then with 7.5 g of the solid obtained above as suspended in 15 ml of refined kerosene, at 20 C under stirring, followed by further addition of 1.83 ml of ethyl benzoate. The temperature of the system was raised to 1000C. , and the system was stirred at said temperature for 2 hours. Removing the supernatant portion by decantation, further 150 ml of TiCl4 was added to the system, followed by stirring for 2 hours at 1100C The solid was recovered by hot filtration and washed thoroughly with hot kerosene and hexane, to provide aTi composition a . The composition contained, calculated as atom, 4.4 by weight of Ti, 59.0 by weight of Cl, 19.0 by weight of Mg, 13.0 by weight of ethyl benzoate and 0.9 by weight of ethoxy group.Its shape was spherical, having a specific surface area of 207 m2 g.The average particle diameter was 13 , and the uniformity coefficient was 2.75. The X ray diffraction analysis thereof revealed that the maximum peaks of MgC12 were all very broad the half breadth of 110 plane 2.50 . Treatment of Ti composition a with an organoaluminum compound Into a suspension of 0.75 mg atom of the aboveTi composition, calculated as Ti atom, in 50 ml of ndecane, 2.25 mmols of triethylaluminum was added at 200C, and the suspension was stirred for 2 hours. Then the solid portion thereof was separated by decantation and washed thoroughly with n decane. Polymerization A 5 liter autoclave equipped with a stirrer was thoroughly N2 substituted, and into which lOOg of a thoroughly refined polyethylene powder having a bulk density of 0.37, a density of 0.920 and an MI of 25, and subsequently 5 mmols of triisobutylaluminum and 0.02 mg atom, calculated as Ti atom, of the above Ti containing catalyst component A , were added. In the following vapor phase polymerization, the feed rates of ethylene 4methylpentene 1 hydrogen composition were 600 Nl hr. 400 ml hr. 200 Nl hr., the pressure was 6 kg cm2G, and the temperature was 700C. The copolymerization was performed for 2 hours. Thus 368g of a powdery copolymer having a bulk density of 0.37 g ml, a density of 0.920 g cm3 and anMI of 24 dg min was obtained.
