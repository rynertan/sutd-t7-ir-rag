# Cascoded bistable circuit for level sensitive scan design.

## Abstract
The circuit for level sensitive scan design LSSD com prises an L1 bistable device 11 , an L2 bistable device 11 . one current source 25 , a first current switch logic means 17, 18 responsive to a first clock signal for selectively transferring data in L1 device 10 to L2 device 11 , and a second current switch logic means 15, 16 device to supply current serially through said current switch logic means 15, 16 and L1 L2 devices so as to maintain each in a latch condition.
