## Description
The present invention relates to a particular type of zirconium phosphate and to the method for its preparation. One among the most widely used and studied ion exchangers belonging to the class of acid salts of tetravalent metals is zirconium phosphate with layer structure of alpha type A. Clearfield, Inorganic Ion Exchange Materials, C.R.C. Press, Boca Raton FA USA, 1982 . Such an ion exchanger has been obtained by two different preparation methods. In the first method, known as the reflux method , zirconium phosphate is first prepared in the amorphous state, and the product is then crystallized by refluxing it in aqueous solutions of phosphoric acid A. Clearfield and J.A. Stynes, J. Inorg. Nucl. Chem. In the second method, also known as the method by direct precipitation in the presence of HF , a solution is first prepared containing a zirconium IV fluorocomplex in phosphoric acid G. Alberti, E. Torraca, J.Inorg. Nucl. Chem. By slow thermal decomposition of Zr fluorocomplexes crystals having a size of a few millimeters can be prepared. G.Alberti, R.Giulietti, J.Inorg.Nucl.Chem., Independently of the method of preparation, a zirconium phosphate having an alpha type layered structure has the composition Zr HPO₄ ₂.H₂O and an interlayer distance of 0,76 nm 7,6 angstrom . The water molecule is lost by heating to 110 C and the interlayer distance drops from 0,76 nm to 0,74 nm 7,6 angstrom to 7,4 angstrom . Such a dehydration is irreversible and the anhydrous Zr phosphate cannot be rehydrated even by soaking it in water. The crystalline structure of alpha Zr HPO₄ ₂.H₂O is well known at present A.Clearfield and G.D.Smith, Inorg.Chem., The arrangement of the EP A 0 094 919 discloses a method for preparing Zr phosphate comprising the steps of intercalating, into a crystalline Zr phosphate alpha Zr HPO₄ ₂.H₂O an organic substance containing a proton acceptor group and water, thus obtaining a colloidal aqueous suspension of said intercalated Zr phosphate which is then treated with acids, with the formation of a Zr acid phosphate with modified lamellar structure, the precipitate being separated from the mother liquors, and finally washed with diluted acids and or water. It has been surprisingly found that a type of Zr phosphate permits the passage of and the intercalation of ions larger than the potassium ion and thus the drawbacks of the prior art can be overcome. This invention, therefore, provides a particulate zirconium acid phosphate of modified structure, characterized in that it has a particle size of from 1 micrometre to 100 micrometres, a lamellar structure with interlayer of distance in the anhydrous state of from 0,79 nm to 0,82 nm 7,9 Angstrom to 8,2 Angstrom and a surface area of from 9 m² g to 20m² g. According to another aspect of the present invention, a process is provided for preparing the particulate zirconium phosphate as defined above by intercalating, into crystalline zirconium phosphate alpha Zr HPO₄ ₂.H₂O having an interplanar distance of 0,76 nm 7,6 Angstrom , an organic substance containing a proton acceptor group and water until a stable colloidal aqueous suspension of intercalated zirconium phosphate is prepared, characterized in that it further comprises the steps of In a preferred embodiment, the treatment with ultrasounds is continued until such time as the optical density of the suspension remains constant and is thenceforth unaffected by the ultrasounds. It should be observed that the zirconium acid phosphate having modified lammelar structure obtained according to the invention and hereunder indicated also as delaminated ZPH , has properties of exchange, intercalation and absorption very different from those of the materials of the prior art on the basis of lamellar zirconium phosphate with layer structure of alpha type. As the organic substance containing proton acceptor groups, an amine is preferably used and this is preferably selected between methylamine and n propylamine. In the following, reference is made to this latter for easiness sake, and the phenomena which can be evidenced during the process of the invention are explained. The crystals of α Zr HPO₄ ₂.H₂O are dispersed in water and n propylamine is added to the dispersion under mechanical stirring. For example, the amount of propylamine can be varied within the range of from 25 to 75 preferably 50 of the number of gram atoms of acidic protons present in the α Zr HPO₄ ₂.H₂O amount used usually, n propylamine is added at a slow addition rate, but the addition modalities are not crytical. Also the ratio between the amount of crystals and the amount of water used can be varied within a wide range, from a minimum of 0.05 g per 100 g of water up to a maximum value which is essentially a function of the stirring system used and of its efficiency. In fact, while the amine is being progressively added, the mixture viscosity tends to increase, and the higher the zirconium phosphate water ratio, the greater such an increase in viscosity. The modification in lamellar structure caused by the intercalating of n propylamine is such, that a very stable colloidal suspension is even formed. Such a suspension can be obtained also by causing the intercalation to take place in a non aqueous medium e.g., in an alcohol, in particular in methanol and then adding water. The suspension of zirconium phosphate with modified lamellar structure obtained by intercalation in water or by dispersion in water of the intercalated product previously prepared in a non aqueous medium is used for the treatment with ultrasounds. The regeneration of zirconium phosphate in hydrogen form is carried out by acidifying the colloidal suspension up to a pH value comprised within the range of from 0 to 3, preferably to pH 1. The acidification causes also the flocculation of zirconium acid phosphate, which can be recovered by simple filtering, and washing and drying in air at room temperature or by spray drying or freeze drying. Differently from α Zr HPO₄ ₂.H₂O For example, the absorption of Cs ion from an 0.1 M CsCl aqueous solution maintained at pH 3 is of 1.25 meq g, that of methylene blue from aqueous solution arrives up to 1.85 meq g, bornylamine and quinine can be accomodated inside the interlayer region, whilst alcohols are even intercalated by the exchanger also by simple cold washing with them. The dry product has also the property of considerably hydrating when it is contacted with water, with formation of a Zr HPO₄ ₂.nH₂O, the value of In some samples the hydration is so high that when they are placed in water, they swell up to yield a gelified mass showing an X ray diffraction spectrum similar to that of the amorphous substances. However, by carrying out a gradual drying, it has been found, by controlling the X ray diffraction spectrum of the samples, that the peaks typical of the phases with lower hydration degree gradually reappear, until finally the anhydrous compound having an interlayer distance comprised within the range of 0,79 nm to 0,82 nm from 7.9 to 8,2 Å is obtained. Such a behaviour would let think that the interlayer distance of the samples dipped into water may reach even larger values than those obtained by the conditioning under relative moisture of 92 1,01 nm 10,1 Å . It should be observed that the method according to the present invention leads also to the obtainment of powders constituted by particles the planar dimensions of which are of the same order of magnitude as of the initial α Zr HPO₄ ₂. H₂O crystals, whilst the thickness, due to the modification occurred in the lamellar structure, is considerably lower from 10 to 200 times lower . As a consequence, the surface area of delaminated ZPH according to the present invention is considerably larger than that of crystalline zirconium phosphate α Zr HPO₄ ₂.H₂O being used as the starting material. By starting for example from crystals having sizes of some tens of µm and surface areas of 0.1 0.2 m² g, products with surface areas of 9 20 m² g can be obtained. The combination of a high surface area with particles having considerable planar distances is a typical characteristic of delaminated ZPH according to the present invention and such a characteristic, besides to the purpose of the surface absorption of various polar substances, can be advantageously used in all catalytic processes in which zirconium phosphate is used, both as catalyst and as catalyst support. Some examples are now supplied to the purpose of better illustrating the invention, it being understood that the invention must not be considered as limited to them or by them. Because the number of equivalents of acidic protons present per g of delaminated ZPH depends on the hydration degree, which depends in its turn on the relative humidity under which the sample has been conditioned, in the following examples the absorption capacity, for comparison homogeneousness sake, is referred, unless otherways specified, to 1 g of anhydrous product. Zirconium phosphate with layer structure of alpha type has been prepared by the method of direct precipitation in the presence of hydrofluoric acid. In particular, 85 g of ZrOCl₂.8H₂O was dissolved in 1.2 l of water. To the solution first 80 ml of concentrated solution at 40 by weight of HF and then 715 ml of phosphoric acid at 85 by weight were added. The clear solution placed in a plastics vessel was heated in water bath at 80 C and into it pre humidified air was bubbled. The complete precipitation was reached over a time of about 4 days. The crystals were separated from the solution, washed with distilled water up to pH 4 4.5 and stored in dryer over phosphoric anhydride. One gram of α Zr HPO₄ ₂.H₂O prepared as above said with average crystal size around 15 µm and surface area of 0.2 m² g was suspended in 100 ml of water, and 50 ml was added of an 0.066 M n propylamine aqueous solution. The additions was carried out slowly, dropwise during about 4 hours under vigorous stirring. By keeping the mixture stirred for further about 20 hours a colloidal suspension of product with modified lamellar structure was obtained. This suspension was treated with ultrasounds frequency of 7 MHz and power of 150 W for a total time of 14 minutes. The ultrasound treatment was carried out by alternating 2 minutes of treatment to one minute of rest interval, during which the vessel was cooled by dipping into water. After this treatment, the optical density of the suspension at 620 nm varied from the initial value of 0.41 to an end value of 0.10. The solution was then acidified with 6 M HCl up to pH 0.7. The so obtained precipitate was filtered off, washed three times each time with 100 cc of 0.1 M HCl, and finally with water until the washing liquors reached a pH 3.5. To the moist product obtained water was added up to a total volume of 60 ml, and stirred, to obtain a suspension which was poured by small portions into liquid nitrogen. The frozen granules were freeze dried. The solid product obtained was further dried at 70 C and under a pressure of 19.95 mbar 15 mm The obtained product, after conditioning at room temperature over phosphoric anhydride, had an interlayer distance,measured from the powder X ray dispersion spectrum, of 0,81 nm 8.1 Å . It should be observed that during the determination of the diffraction spectrum the sample must be protected against atmospheric humidity, otherways phenomena of rehydrating occur, which cause an increase of the interlayer distance . The surface area of the product, computated from the nitrogen absorption data by the BET method, was of 19 m² g. In Fig. 1A a photomicrograph of the product taken with by a scanning electron microscope Philips Mod. 501 B at 791X magnification, and in Fig 1B the photomicrograph of the same product at 6330X magnification, are reported. In the two photomicrographs the white segments represent 10 µm and 1 µm respectively. From the two photomicrographs the dimensions and the morphological characteristics of the individual particles can be easily seen. The absorption power of the product for methylene blue from aqueous solution has resulted of 1.1 mmol of dye per g of product. One gram of α Zr HPO₄ ₂.H₂O of Example 1 was suspended in 50 ml of water and to it 25 ml of 0.13 M n propylamine aqueous solution was added. The addition modalities and all other operations were carried out exactly as described in Example 1. The end yield in dry delaminated ZPH was of 0.97 g, its interlayer distance at room temperature and under relative humidity 60 was 0,87 nm 8.7 Å . Its absorption power for methylene blue was 1.2 mmol g. The process was carried out exactly as described in Example 2, with the difference that the recovery of the product in the dry state was carried out by spray drying. The yield was 0.8 g, the interlayer distance of the product obtained under the same conditions as of Example 2 was 0,86 nm 8.6 Å , and the absorption power for methylene blue was 0.9 mmol g. The process was carried out exactly as described in Example 2. The recovery of the end product in the dry state was carried out by direct drying of the moist product at 70 C and under a pressure of 19.95 mbar 15 mm The yield was 0.92 g, the interlayer distance was 0,88 nm 8.8 Å , relative humidity of 60 and the absorption power for methylene blue 1.3 mmol g. One gram of α Zr HPO₄ ₂.H₂O, the same sample as of Example 1, was suspended in 50 ml of absolute methanol containing 0.28 ml 0.0033 mol of n propylamine and was kept under stirring for about 10 hours. The intercalary amine containing product, after filtering and drying, was suspended in 150 ml of water and stirred for 30 minutes. The so obtained colloidal suspension was submitted to treatment with ultrasounds by the same modalities as described in Example 1. The optical density of the ultrasound treated end solution was of 0.099 at 620 nm. By proceeding exactly as described in Example 1, 0.94 g of product having and interlayer distance of 0,86 nm 8.6 Å relative humidity 60 and an absorption power for methylene blue of 0.9 mmol g of product conditioned over P₂O₅ was obtained. The surface area of this product BET was of 15 m² g. An amount of 1.000 g of product obtained as described in Example 1 was brought to constant weight in vacuum dryer over phosphoric anhydride and subsequently equilibrated over saturated solutions of magnesium nitrate relative humidity R.H. 60 , of sodium chloride R.H. 75 , and barium chloride R.H. 92 . The following weight increases and the following values of interlayer distance were recorded The sample reconditioned over phosphoric anhydride returned back to its starting weight of 1.000 g. Another sample of 0.284 g of delaminated ZPH, prepared according to Example 2, stored in air R.H. 60 , dried in oven at 150 C for 24 hours showed a weight loss of 7.6 . This dry product, kept resting in air on the analytical balance returned to its initial weight within of about 2 hours. One gram of zirconium phosphate with modified lamellar structure and conditioned over P₂O₅ prepared as described in Example 2 was dispersed with strong stirring in 100 ml of 0.100 M CsCl solution having pH 3.00. An immediate decrease in the pH value was observed in the solution, which value, about 1 minute after the addition of delaminated ZPH resulted equal to 1.79. In order to raise the pH to a value of 3.00, 12.5 ml of a 0.100 M CsOH solution was added. It can be inferred that under these conditions 1 g of delaminated ZPH exchanges 1.25 mmol of its acidic protons with 1.25 mmol of Cs . The same test has been carried out by using 1 g of α Zr HPO₄ ₂.H₂O starting material of Example 1 used to obtain the delaminated ZPH . In this case, no appreciable changes in pH were observed in solution and hence no absorption of Cs had occurred. One gram of delaminated ZPH conditioned over P₂O₅ prepared as described in Example 2 was dispersed under strong stirring in 150 ml of a 0.050 M BaCl₂ solution having pH 5.25. An immediate decrease in pH value was observed in solution, which value, about 1 minute after the addition, resulted equal to 1.75. The analysis of the supernatant solution for Ba content showed the presence of residual 6.45 mmol of Ba ions, as compared to the 7.50 mmol initially present. It can be inferred that under these conditions 1 g of delaminated ZPH exchanges 2.1 mmol of its acidic protons with 2.1 mmol of Ba ions. One g of α Zr HPO₄ ₂.H₂O was treated as described in Example 1, until the colloidal solution was obtained. This latter, after having undergone the treatment with ultrasounds was acidified. The obtained precipitate was washed first with 0.1 M HCl and then with water as described in Example 1. The moist product which was obtained was washed three times with absolute ethanol. Its interlayer distance resulted to be 1,42 nm 14.2 Å , similar to that of crystalline zirconium phosphate with two intercalary alcohol molecules. Another aliquot of the product was washed with n propyl alcohol three times . In this case, the moist product showed on X ray analysis an interlayer distance of 1,66 nm 16.6 Å , similar to that of the intercalation compound Zr HPO₄ ₂.n propanol U. Costantino, J. Chem. S. Dalton, 402 1979 . One g of α Zr HPO₄ ₂.H₂O underwent the lamellar structure modification, ultrasound treatment and washing as described in Example 1, until a moist product was obtained. This latter was dispersed again in water up to a total volume of 100 ml. This suspension was analyzed for its content in zirconium phosphate by drawing, under stirring, 5 ml portions, which, placed inside weighing bottles, were kept at 70 C and under a pressure of 19,95 mbar 15 mm To 10 ml of suspension 25 ml was added of a 0.0102 M aqueous solution of methylene blue equivalent to 0.255 mmol . After letting the equilibrium to be reached under stirring for 48 hours, the supernatant solution was analyzed for its content in methylene blue. The residual content was 0.088 mmol. It can be inferred that the product had absorbed 1.85 mmol of dye per g of product conditioned over phosphoric anhydride. To 15 ml of the aqueous suspension of Example 10, containing 142.5 mg of anhydrous product, 55 ml of absolute ethanol and 30 ml of a 0.073 M solution of bornylamine in alcohol were added. After 24 hours of equilibration, 10 ml of supernatant solution was drawn and titrated with 3.16 ml of 0.05 M HCl, from which it can be inferred that the intercalary bornylamine was equal to 4.28 mmol g. To 8 ml of the aqueous suspension of Example 10, containing 76 mg of anhydrous product, 89.5 ml of absolute ethanol and 2.5 ml of a 0.052 N solution of quinine in alcohol were added. After 24 hours of contact time, the supernatant solution was analyzed for its content in residual quinine. Such a content resulted equal to 0.0809 mmol as compared to the 0.130 mmol initially added to react. It can be inferred that the product capacity to absorb quinine was equal to 0.31 mmol of quinine per g.
