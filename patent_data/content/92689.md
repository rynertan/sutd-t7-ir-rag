# Electrostatic copying apparatus.

## Abstract
An electrostatic copying apparatus of the type including a support frame 6 having a front support wall 76 and a rear support wall 78 located with a predetermined space therebetween in the front and rear direction, said support frame 6 being mounted on a housing defining the appar atus, so that it is slidable in the front and rear direction between its operating position within the housing and its pull out position forwardly of the housing, and mounted on said support frame, a rotating drum 10 having a photosen sitive member disposed on its peripheral surface and a developing device 14 for developing a latent electrostatic image formed on the photosensitive member. Each of the rear surface of the front support wall and the front surface of the rear support wall in the support frame has a semicircular receiving portion 144, 146 having an open top, and each end of the rotating drum has mounted thereon a shaft bearing member 106, 108 having a circular peripheral surface.
