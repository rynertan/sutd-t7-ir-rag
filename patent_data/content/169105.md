## Description
This invention concerns an osmotically activated system for dispensing pharmacologically active agent s . The system comprises an inner core compartment of osmotically active composition surrounded by an enclosing wall material. The core comprises pharmacologically active agent s soluble in an external fluid, or a mixture of agent s having a limited solubility in the external fluid with osmotically effective solute s that is are soluble in the fluid, which exhibit an osmotic pressure gradient across the wall against the external fluid. The wall constitutes a layer of controlled porosity that is substantially permeable to both the external fluid and the core composition. Agent is released from he system by fluid imbibition through the wall into the inner core compartment at a rate controlled by the wall composition and dimensions, producing a solution containing agent that is released through the wall at a controlled rate in response to fluid volume flux, dV dt, resulting from the osmotic pressure gradient, and diffusive flux, dM dt of the active agent in the dissolved core composition and remains constant when excess solid core mass is present. For the special case where the core mass is pure active agent, the dissolved concentration is equal to the active agent solubility, S, in the fluid. In the present invention the volume flux contribution, dV dt C, to the total rate is greater than the diffusive contribution, dM dt The object of this invention is to provide an osmotically actuated system for controlled delivery of pharmacologically active agents to biological receptor sites over a prolonged period of time. The controlled porosity wall of the present invention is substantially permeable to both solute and external fluid. The wall is composed of materials that maintain their physical and chemical integrity during the controlled dispensing of agent in mixture with materials that can be leached into the external fluid. The wall has programmable fluid transmission and agent release rates which provide for controlled release of agent which is free from environmental influences including pH and degree of external fluid agitation. The wall may be composed of either insoluble, non erodible materials mixed with leachable additives, or bioerodible materials containing leachable additives. Bioerodible materials would be selected to bioerode after a predetermined period with bioerosion occurring subsequent to the period of agent release. Another object of the invention is to provide an osmotic system that is readily manufactureable to deliver a pre determined dose of agent at a programmed rate from compositions of matter in the varied geometries and sizes of tablets, pellets, multi particulates, and such related dosage forms as familiar to those skilled in the art for oral, buccal, vaginal, rectal, nasal, ocular, aural, parenteral and related routes of administration.

The pores can be continuous pores that have an opening on both faces of a microporous lamina, pores interconnected through tortuous paths of regular and irregular shapes including curved, curved linear, randomly oriented continuous pores, hindered connected pores and other porous paths discernible by microscopic examination. Generally, microporous lamina are defined by the pore size, the number of pores, the tortuosity of the microporous path and the porosity which relates to the size and number of pores. The pore size of a microporous lamina is easily ascertained by measuring the observed pore diameter at the surface of the material under the electron microscope as shown in Figure 17. Generally, materials possessing from 5 to 95 pores and having a pore size of from 0.001 to 100 µm can be used. Any pH insensitive pore forming additives may be used in the instant invention. The microporous wall may be formed The microporous materials can be made by etched nuclear tracking, by cooling a solution of flowable polymer below the freezing point with subsequent evaporation of solvent to form pores, by gas formation in a polymer solution which upon curing results in pore formation, by cold or hot stretching at low or high temperatures until pores are formed, by leaching from a polymer a soluble component by an appropriate solvent, by ion exchange reaction, and by polyelectrolyte processes. Processes for preparing microporous materials are described in It is generally desirable from a preparation standpoint to mix the polymer in a solvent.

Exemplary plasticizers suitable for the present purpose include plasticizers that lower the temperature of the second order phase transition of the wall or the elastic modulus thereof and also increase the workability of the wall, its flexibility and its permeability to fluid. Plasticizers operable for the present purpose include both cyclic plasticizers and acyclic plasticizers. Typical plasticizers are those selected from the group consisting of phthalates, phosphates, citrates, adipates,tartrates, sebacates, succinates, glycolates, glycerolates, benzoates, myristates, sulfonamides, and halogenated phenyls. Generally, from 0.001 to 50 parts of a plasticizer or a mixture of plasticizers are incorporated into 100 parts of wall forming material.

Procedures for selecting a plasticizer having the described characteristics are disclosed in the The expressions flux regulator agent , flux enhancing agent and flux decreasing agent as used herein mean a compound that when added to a wall forming material assists in regulating the fluid permeability of flux through the wall. The agent can be preselected to increase or decrease the liquid flux. Agents that produce a marked increase in permeability to fluid such as water, are often essentially hydrophilic, while those that produce a marked decrease to fluids such as water, are essentially hydrophobic. The flux regulators in some embodiments also can increase the flexibility and porosity of the lamina. Examples of flux regulators include polyhydric alcohols and derivatives thereof, such as polyalkylene glycols of the formula H O alkylene Additional flux regulators include poly α,ω alkylenediols wherein the alkylene is straight or branched chain of from 2 to 10 carbon atoms such as poly 1,3 propanediol, poly 1,4 butanediol, poly 1,5 pentanediol and poly 1,6 hexanediol. The diols also include aliphatic diols of the formula HOC Other flux regulators include esters and polyesters of alkylene glycols of the formula HO alkylene O The amount of flux regulator added to a material generally is an amount sufficient to produce the desired permeability, and it will vary according to the lamina forming material and the flux regulator used to modulate the permeability. Usually from 0.001 parts up to 50 parts, or higher of flux regulator can be used to achieve the desired results. Surfactants useful for the present purpose are those surfactants, when added to a wall forming material and other materials, aid in producing an integral composite that is useful for making the operative wall of a device. The surfactants act by regulating the surface energy of materials to improve their blending into the composite. This latter material is used for manufacturing devices that maintain their integrity in the environment of use during the agent release period. Generally, the surfactants are amphipathic molecules comprised of a hydrophobic part and a hydrophilic part. The surfactants can be anionic, cationic, nonionic or amphoteric, and they include anionics such as sulfated esters, amides, alcohols, ethers and carboxylic acids sulfonated aromatic hydrocarbons, aliphatic hydrocarbons, esters and ethers acylated amino acids and peptides and metal alkyl phosphates cationic surfactants such as primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary alkylammonium salts acylated polyamines and salts of heterocyclic amines, arylammonium surfactants such as esters of polyhydric alcohols alkoxylated amines polyoxyalkylene esters and ethers of polyoxyalkylene glycols alkanolamine fatty acid condensates tertiary acetylamic glycols and dialkyl polyoxyalkylene phosphates and ampholytics such as betamines and amino acids.

Suitable surfactants can be selected from the above and from other surfactants for blending with wall forming materials by using the surfactant s hydrophile lipophile balance number, HLB. This number represents the proportion between the weight percentages of hydrophilic and lipophilic groups in a dispersant. In use, the number indicates the behavior of the surfactant, that is, the higher the number the more hydrophilic the surfactant and the lower the number the more lipophilic the surfactant. The required HLB number for blending wall forming materials is determined by selecting a surfactant with a known number, blending it with the materials and observing the results. A homogeneous composite is formed with the correct number, while a heterogeneous mixture indicates a different number is needed. This new number can be selected by using the prior number as a guide. The HLB number is known to the art for many surfactants, and they can be experimentally determined according to the procedure in The osmotically active core composition mass 3 of Figure 1, is typically in the form of a solid conventional tablet, pellet, or multiparticulate. The core is completely encased by the controlled porosity wall 2 . The core can be comprised of either a pure agent 4 or a mixture of agents 4, 5, etc. combined to give the desired manufacturing and ultimate agent s delivery characteristics. The number of agents that may be combined to make the core is substantially without an upper limit with the lower limit equalling one component. The preferred specifications for the core are summarized below and include S ρ ratios greater than 0.1 fall within the workings of the invention and result in lower percentages of initial core mass delivered under zero order kinetics. S ρ can be selected to give acceptable combined characteristics of stability, release rate, and manufacturability. In cases where the active agent has the desired solubility, osmotic pressure, density, stability, and manufacturability characteristics, there is no critical upper limit as to the amount that can be incorporated into a core mass and typically will follow the core loading size specification 1. The lower limit ratio of agent to excipient is dictated by the desired osmotic activity of the core composition, the desired time span of release, and the pharmacologicial activity of the active agent. Generally the core will contain 0.01 to 90 by weight or higher, of an active agent in mixture with another solute s . Representative of compositions of matter that can be released from the device and can function as a solute are, without limitation, those compositions soluble in fluids inside the core compartment as described. The solubilized constituents create a water activity gradient across the wall, 2 , of Figure 1, resulting in osmotically actuated fluid movement constituting the osmotic pump action of the invention.

Examples of beneficial drugs are disclosed in The drug can be in various forms, such as uncharged molecules, molecular complexes, pharmacologically acceptable salts such as hydrochlorides, hydrobromides, sulfate, laurylate, palmitate, phosphate, nitrite, borate, acetate, maleate, tartrate, oleate, and salicylate. For acid drugs, salts of metals, amines or organic cations, for example quaternary ammonium can be used. Derivatives of drugs such as esters, ethers and amides which have solubility characteristics suitable for use herein can be used alone or mixed with other drugs. Also, a drug that is water insoluble can be used in a form that is a water soluble derivative thereof to effectively serve as a solute, and on its release from the device, is converted by enzymes, hydrolyzed by body pH or other metabolic processes to the original form, or to a biologically active form. The agent can be in the reservoir as a solution, dispersion, paste, cream, particle, granule, emulsion, suspension or powder. Also, the agent can be mixed with a binder, dispersant, emulsifier or wetting agent and dyes. The amount of active agent or active agent admixed with other osmotically active solutes present in the device is initially in excess of the amount than can be dissolved in the fluid that enters the reservoir. Under this physical state when the agent is in excess, the device will osmotically operate to give a substantially constant rate of release. The rate of agent release pattern can also be varied by having different amounts of agent in the reservoir to form solutions containing different concentrations of agent for delivery from the device. Generally, the device can house from 0.05 ng to 5 grams or more, with individual devices containing, for example, 25 ng, 1 mg, 5 mg, 250 mg, 500 mg, 1.5 g and the like. Preferably at least 1 mg of active agent is used. Mixtures of drug agent s with other osmotically effective compounds may be used to attract fluid into the device producing a solution of compound which is delivered from the device concomitantly transporting drug agent to the exterior of the device. Examples include magnesium sulfate, magnesium chloride, sodium chloride, lithium chloride, potassium sulfate, sodium carbonate, sodium sulfite, lithium sulfate, potassium chloride, calcium bicarbonate, sodium sulfate, calcium sulfate, potassium acid phosphate, calcium lactate, d mannitol, urea, inositol, sorbitol, magnesium succinate, tartaric acid, carbohydrates such as raffinose, sucrose, glucose, α d lactose monohydrate, and mixtures thereof. The compound is initially present in excess and it can be in any physical form such as particle, crystal, pellet, tablet, strip, film or granule. The osmotic pressure of saturated solutions of various osmotically effective compounds and for mixtures of compounds at 37 C, in water, is listed in Table 2. In the table, the osmotic pressure , is in atmospheres, atm. The osmotic pressure is measured in a commercially available osmometer that measures the vapor pressure difference between pure water and the solution to be analyzed, and according to standard thermodynamic principles, the vapor pressure ratio is converted into osmotic pressure difference. In Table 2, osmotic pressures of from 20 atm to 500 atm are set forth of course, the invention includes the use of lower osmotic pressures from greater than zero, and higher osmotic pressures than those set forth by way of example in Table 2. For example, in the gastrointestinal tract, the osmotic pressure gradient across the wall in the compartment will be from greater than 0 up to 500 atm per membrane thickness. That is, the osmotic pressure in the compartment will be typically in excess of 8 atm up to 500 atm. The resulting device will have a water permeability driven by a saturated solution of the active agent, or mixtures of active agents with other osmotically active solutes, at the temperature of use, of 0.01 ml per cm² of surface area per day to 10 ml per cm² of surface area per hour. A plurality of osmotic systems for the osmotically controlled release of the beneficial drug potassium chloride were made as follows First, 650 mg aliquots of commercially available reagent grade potassium chloride active agent were compressed to a hardness of 15Kg by standard compression techniques in a Stokes tableting machine fitted with a 0.95 cm 3 8 inch extra deep concave punch. A total of 700 g of such tablets were prepared as osmotic core composition masses of the invention. Next, 36 g of Eastman cellulose acetate 398 10 polymer were added to methylene chloride solvent , with subsequent addition of methanol solvent with high speed mechanical stirring to complete the dissolution of the polymer. To this was added 7.9 g of polyethylene glycol 400 plasticizer, liquid pore forming additive and flux regulator . To this solution was added in dropwise fashion with stirring a second solution of water and methanol solvent containing 18 g of dissolved sorbitol solid pore forming additive , to constitute the solution utilized to form the controlled porosity wall of the invention. The final solution contained approximately 2 , by weight, polymer in a solvent system of methylene chloride, methanol, and water in the approximate weight ratio of 15 10 1. The fluid permeability of the wall was 2.28 x 10 ¹⁵ cm³ sec g. Next, 700 g of the potassium chloride osmotic core tablets was charged into a commercial Uni Glatt fluidized bed machine wherein the wall forming solution was applied to the cores until a thickness of 0.016 cm was attained. The finished osmotic systems were dried in an oven at 50 C to facilitate removal of residual solvents. Finally, the potassium chloride release from these osmotic systems into distilled water was monitored conductiometrically at 37 C in a commercial Applied Analytical standard dissolution apparatus providing 100 rpm stirring. The release profile is depicted in Figure 2 labelled as MMP 50 modified microporous, sorbitol 50 of polymer wt and was found to be continuous at a mean rate of 139 mg per hour for a prolonged period of approximately 4 hours. Since the solute is passing through the wall, it has a reflection coefficient substantially less than 1. The amount of potassium chloride released with zero order kinetics was consistent with the theoretically anticipated amount which was calculated with Equation 1 to be 82.7 of the initial KCl loaded into the core mass where M A plurality of osmotic systems were manufactured according to the procedure of Example 1, wherein the conditions were as described except that the sorbitol content of the wall forming solution was 9 g. Potassium chloride release from these systems was monitored according to the procedure of Example 1. The release profile is depicted in Fig. 2 labelled as MMP 25 and was found to be continuous for a prolonged period at a mean rate of 120 mg per hour for approximately 5 hours. The fluid permeability of the wall was 1.69 x10 ¹⁵ cm³ sec g. A plurality of osmotic systems were manufactured according to the procedure of Example 1, wherein the conditions were as described except that the sorbitol content of the wall forming solution was 3.6 g. Potassium chloride release from these systems was monitored according to the procedure of Example 1. The release profile is depicted in Fig. 2 labelled as MMP 10 and was found to be continuous for a prolonged period at a mean rate of 80 mg per hour for approximately 7.5 hours. The fluid permeability of the wall was 0.81 x 10 ¹⁵ cm³ sec g. A plurality of osmotic systems were manufactured according to the procedures of Example 1. Potassium chloride release from these systems was monitored conductiometrically at 37 C in a commercial Applied Analytical standard dissolution apparatus under the various conditions of stirring a 100 rpm continuously b 100 rpm intermittent with 0 rpm c and 0 rpm continuously. The potassium chloride release profiles of Fig. 3 kept their uniformity and configuration for a prolonged period without stirring induced effects for osmotic systems MMP 10, MMP 25, and MMP 50. A plurality of osmotic systems were manufactured according to the procedure of Example 1, wherein the conditions were as described except that the wall forming solution was applied for sufficient duration so as to produce osmotic systems with wall thicknesses of 0.016 cm, 0.029 cm, and 0.044 cm. Potassium chloride release from these osmotic systems was monitored according to the procedure of Example 1. The release profiles depicted in Fig. 4 were continuous for a prolonged period with release rates decreasing with increasing wall thickness. A plot of 1 wall thickness versus mean release rate is given in Fig. 5 indicating that the osmotic release of potassium chloride is in accordance with the inverse proportionality A plurality of osmotic systems were manufactured according to the procedure of Example 1, wherein the conditions were as described. Release of potassium chloride from these osmotic systems into 200 ml volumes of unstirred water, pH 1.2 HCl buffer, or pH 8 phosphate buffer solutions adjusted with sodium chloride to be isoosmotic with blood was followed by conductiometrically analyzing the potassium chloride residue from 3 osmotic systems at each time interval by cutting the wall and dissolving the contents in distilled water. Based on an initial amount of 0.65 g KCl in the core composition, the amount of KCl released at each time was calculated with equation 2. The release profile is depicted in Fig. 6 where a clear independence of release rate from the pH of the external fluid is evident. A plurality of osmotic systems were manufactured according to the procedure of Example 1, wherein the conditions were as described. Release of potassium chloride from these osmotic systems into 200 ml volumes of unstirred distilled water, 1.5 molar urea, 3 molar urea, 5.3 molar urea, or 7.5 molar urea at 25 C was followed by conduction metrically analyzing the potassium chloride residue from 3 osmotic systems at each time interval by cutting the wall and dissolving the core composition contents in distilled water. The release profiles are depicted in Fig. 7 where increasing the urea concentration in the external fluid reduced the release rate of the potassium chloride from the osmotic system as evidenced by the diminishing slopes of the lines. The osmotic pressures of the various fluids of concern were calculated using established thermodynamic relationships and experimental data as given in A plot of potassium chloride release rate versus π net is given in Fig. 8 to illustrate the dependence of core composition release rate on the osmotic pressure difference across a wall barrier permeable to both an external fluid and core composition. A plurality of osmotic systems for the osmotically controlled release of the beneficial drug sodium indomethacin trihydrate were made as follows First, 3 g sodium indomethacin trihydrate were mixed with 4.5 g sorbitol in a commercial Mini Mill for 1 minute. 250 mg aliquots were individually weighed and compressed in a standard 3 8 inch extra deep concave tableting die under 3 tons pressure on a Carver hydraulic press to form the core composition masses of the invention. 30 Such core masses were manufactured. The solution utilized to form the controlled porosity wall was prepared according to the procedure of Example 1, wherein the conditions were as described, except that the sorbitol content of the wall forming solution was 9 g. Next, 30 core composition masses were mixed with 700 g of potassium chloride placebo tablets in a commercial Uni Glatt fluidized bed machine, wherein the wall forming solution was applied to the core masses until a thickness of 95 µm was attained. The finished osmotic systems were dried in an oven to 50 C to facilitate removal of residual solvents. The release of sodium indomethacin from these osmotic systems into 0.07M phosphate buffer, pH 6.6, was monitored by ultraviolet light absorption measurements at a wavelength of 320 nm in standard 1 cm pathlength quartz cells in a commercial double beam Beckman Acta V spectrophotometer. Release was conducted at 37 C with 100 rpm stirring provided by paddles in a commercial Applied Analytical standard dissolution apparatus. The release profile is depicted in Fig. 9 where the equivalent mgs of indomethacin in free acid form released versus time in hours is plotted. The release was continuous and uniform for a prolonged period at a mean rate of 34.6 mg hr. A plurality of osmotic systems for the osmotically controlled release of the beneficial drug sodium indomethacin trihydrate were made as follows First, 3 g sodium indomethacin trihydrate was mixed with 13.5 g sorbitol in a commercial Mini Mill for 1 minute. 550 Mg aliquots were individually weighed and compressed in a standard 0.95cm 3 8 inch extra deep concave tableting die under 3 tons pressure on a Carver hydraulic press to from the core composition masses of the invention. 30 Such core masses were manufactured. The wall forming solution was prepared according to the procedure of Example 8, wherein the conditions are as described except that the sorbitol content of the wall forming solution was 3.6 g. Next, 30 core composition masses were mixed with 700 g of potassium chloride placebo tablets in a commercial Uni Glatt fluidized bed machine, wherein the wall forming solution was applied to the core masses until a thickness of 130 µm was attained. The finished osmotic systems were dried in an oven at 50 C to facilitate removal of residual solvents. The release of sodium indomethacin from these osmotic systems into 0.07M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, made isoosmotic to blood with additional sodium chloride was monitored by ultraviolet light absorption measurements at a wavelength of 320 nm in standard 1 cm pathlength quartz cells in a commercial Beckman DU 7 spectrophotometer. Release was conducted at 37 C with 100 rpm stirring provided by paddles in a commercial Applied Analytical dissolution apparatus. The release profile is depicted in Fig. 10 where the mgs of sodium indomethacin trihydrate released versus time in hours is plotted. The release was continuous and uniform for a prolonged period at a mean rate of 20.7 mg hr of sodium indomethacin trihydrate. A plurality of osmotic systems for the osmotically controlled release of the beneficial drug cyclobenzaprine HCl were made as follows First, 3.7 g cyclobenzaprine HCl were mixed with 60 g α D glucose and 17.5 g distilled water to form a mass that was forced through a No. 12 screen and dried The release of cyclobenzaprine HCl from these osmotic systems into distilled water was monitored by ultraviolet light absorption measurements at a wavelength of 290 nm in standard 1 cm pathlength quartz cells in a commercial Beckman DU 7U spectrophotometer. Release was conducted at 37 C with 100 rpm stirring provided by paddles in a commercial Applied Analytical standard dissolution apparatus. The release profile is depicted in Fig. 11 where the mgs of cyclobenzaprine HCl released was continuous and uniform for a prolonged period at a mean rate of 6.9 mg hr. The total amount released in a zero order fashion was approximately 18 mg which agrees well with the theoretically anticipated amount based on the solubility and density of the major osmotic agent in the core composition as calculated from Equation 4 In this example glucose was the major osmotic agent with a solubility to density ratio of 0.38 that calculates to 17.9 mg cyclobenzaprine HCl released in zero order fashion. A plurality of osmotic systems for the osmotically controlled release of the beneficial drug cyclobenzaprine HCl were made according to the procedure of Example 10, wherein the conditions were as described except that the core masses contain 25 mgs cyclobenzaprine HCl and the wall applied to a final thickness of 260 µm. The release of cyclobenzaprine HCl from these osmotic systems into 0.07M phosphate buffers, pH 5 and pH 8, and HCl buffer pH 1 was monitored by ultraviolet light absorption measurements at a wavelength of 290 nm in standard 1 cm pathlength quartz cells in a commercial Beckman DU 7U spectrophotometer. Release was conducted at 37 C with 100 rpm stirring provided by paddles in a commercial Applied Analytical dissolution apparatus. The release profiles are depicted in Fig. 12 where cyclobenzaprine HCl release was uniform and continuous at all pH s examined for a prolonged period with zero order release kinetics observed for delivery of 15.5 mgs which is the theoretically anticipated value based on the solubility and density of the major osmagen, glucose. The mean release rates at pH 1, pH 5, and pH 8 were 1.80 mg hr, 2.14 mg hr, and 1.65 mg hr respectively. Cyclobenzaprine HCl has a pKa of about 8.5 and would be anticipated to have a reduction in solubility as the pH increases. Analysis of fluid within the core of osmotic systems indicated that the pH within the core was not the same as the pH in the external fluid, and that cyclobenzaprine HCl was present in a dissolved state within the core fluids. The observed insensitivity of cyclobenzaprine HCl release to external fluid pH suggests that the intrinsic solubility of cyclobenzaprine is not exceeded in the examples given and the release rate is determined principally by the solubility behavior of the glucose component in the core. A plurality of osmotic systems for the osmotically controlled release of the beneficial drug potassium chloride were made as follows First, 0.78 g aliquots of potassium chloride were compressed to a hardness of 15 kg by standard compression techniques in a Stokes tableting machine fitted with a 0.95 cm 3 8 inch extra deep concave punch. A total of 2 kg of such tablets were prepared as osmotic core composition masses of the invention. Next, 50 g of commercial polymer Eudragit RS 100 were added to methylene chloride with subsequent addition of methanol and high speed mechanical stirring to complete the dissolution of the polymer. To this was added 11 g of polyethylene glycol 400. To this solution was added in dropwise fashion, with stirring, a second solution of water and methanol containing 12.5 g of sorbitol, to constitute the solution utilized to form the controlled porosity wall of the invention. The final solution contained approximately 2.5 , by weight polymer in a solvent system of methylene chloride, methanol and water in the approximate weight ratio of 15 10 1. Next, about 500 ml of the potassium chloride tablet core masses were charged into a commercial Freund Hi Coater baffled pan coating machine wherein the wall forming solution was applied to the cores until a thickness of 120 µm was attained. Twenty five of the tablets were removed at this point with the remainder coated to a final thickness of 190 µm. The release of potassium chloride from these osmotic systems into distilled water was monitored conductiometrically at 37 C in a commercial Applied Analytical standard dissolution apparatus providing 100 rpm stirring. The release profiles are depicted in Fig. 13 and were continuous and uniform for prolonged periods and agreed with the theoretical predictions of Equation 1, Example 1. The mean release rates are 0.14 g hr and 0.078 g hr for the 120 µm and 190 µm wall thicknesses respectively with the rate inversely proportional to the wall thickness. A plurality of osmotic systems for the osmotically controlled release of the beneficial drug cyclobenzaprine HCl were made as follows Core composition masses were manufactured according to the procedures of Example 9, wherein the conditions were as described except that the cyclobenzaprine HCl content of each core was 26 mg. Next, 37.5 g Eudragit RS 100 and 12.5 g Eudragit RL 100 polymers were added to methylene chloride solvent with subsequent addition of methanol solvent and high speed mechanical stirring to complete the dissolution of the polymer and give a polymer blend having a water permeability intermediate to that of the individual Eudragit components. To this solution was added in dropwise fashion, with stirring, a second solution of water and methanol containing 25 g of dissolved sorbitol, to constitute the solution utilized to form the controlled porosity wall of the invention. The final solution contained approximately 2.5 , by weight, polymer in a solvent system of methylene chloride, methanol and water in the approximate weight ratio of 15 10 1. Next, 30 core composition massed were mixed with 500 ml of placebo potassium chloride tablets in a commercial Freund Hi Coater pan coating machine wherein the wall forming solution was applied to the cores until a thickness of 285 µm was attained. The release of cyclobenzaprine HCl from these osmotic systems into 0.07M .05 phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, made isoosmotic to blood with sodium chloride, was monitored by ultraviolet light absorption measurements at a wavelength of 290 nm in standard 1 cm pathlength quartz cells in a commercial Beckman DU 7U spectrophotometer. Release was conducted at 37 C with 100 rpm stirring provided by paddles in a commercial Applied Analytical dissolution apparatus. The release profile is depicted in Fig. 14 where cyclobenzaprine HCl release was uniform and continuous for a prolonged period with zero order kinetics in effect for release of approximately 16 mg of drug which agreed closely with the theoretically anticipated amount of 16.1 mg calculated with Equation 4 of Example 10 with the major osmotic agent, glucose, dominating. Multiparticulate osmotic systems for the controlled release of the beneficial drug potassium chloride were made as follows First, 45 mg aliquots of commercial reagent grade potassium chloride were compressed by standard compression techniques in a Stokes tableting machine fitted with a 0.317 cm 1 8 inch concave punch. A total of 1500 g of such particles were prepared as core masses of the invention. The wall forming solution was prepared according to the procedure of Example 1, wherein the conditions were as described except that the sorbitol content was 9 g. Next, 500 g of the core particles were charged into a commercial Uni Glatt fluidized bed machine wherein the wall forming solution was applied to the cores until a thickness of 0.015 cm was attained. These particulate osmotic systems served as the multiparticulate components of the finished composition osmotic system. The particulate osmotic systems thus prepared were then utilized to deliver potassium chloride when administered as either a single particle, or a multiplicity of particles, to give the desired dose and rate of drug delivery. As a matter of convenience multiparticulates are commonly loaded into gelatin capsules for administration. The release of potassium chloride from multiparticulate osmotic systems into 12 one liter aliquots of distilled water receptor media was monitored conductiometrically at 37 C in a commercial VanKel standard dissolution apparatus providing 100 rpm stirring with paddles. Each of six receptor media were charged with 1 No. 00 gelatin capsule containing 15 particulate osmotic devices. The remaining 6 receptor media were charged with 15 particulate osmotic devices without the aid of a gelatin capsule. The release profiles are depicted in Fig. 15. The release rates with and without gelatin capsules were 0.274 g hr and 0.278 g hr respectively, which suggested the steady state release rate was independent of the gelatin capsule. The lag time was approximately 8 minutes longer with the gelatin capsule systems reflecting the time required for water to penetrate the gelatin before osmotic delivery of agent could begin. The theoretically anticipated release of 0.56 g of KCl with zero order kinetics was observed. The release rates for these multiparticulate systems were within 7 of the release rates observed with a single large osmotic system having a similar wall Example 2 when the rates were normalized for wall thickness and surface area differences. This indicated that the mechanism of osmotic delivery did not change with the size reduction to small particles. Transmembrane flux of water was measured at 37 C in a jacketed glass osmosis cell having two compartments of equal volume 185 ml separated by a 14.34 cm² water equilibrated membrane sheet. Each compartment was stirred continuously at 600 rpm with internally driven magnetic stir bars positioned immediately adjacent to the membrane. Initially, one chamber was filled with deionized water. The second chamber was filled with a saturated aqueous solution of potassium chloride containing excess solid and fitted with a capillary tube 35 cm long with an 0.5 mm diameter core. The capillary was gravimetrically calibrated for volume using deionized water. The osmotically driven volume flux of water, dV dt, from the first chamber into the second was measured by following the rise of fluid in the capillary with a cathetometer accurate to 0.01 cm. The diffusive flux of potassium chloride from the second chamber into the first chamber was measured conductiome trically under the same conditions as the water flux measurements except that the capillary was eliminated. Fluid levels in both chambers were kept equal throughout the diffusion experiments to eliminate hydrostatic pressure effects. The membranes examined were identical in composition to walls applied to core tablets in Examples 1, 2 and 3 and were prepared by spraying onto a flat glass substrate. The measured volume flux of water, dV dt, of Equation 1, for each membrane was multiplied by the potassium chloride solubility, S 0.343 g cm³, and normalized to a wall thickness of 0.016 cm and area of 2.67 cm² to correspond to the wall dimensions of the devices in Examples 1, 2 and 3. This was the calculated osmotic pump contribution to the total release. The diffusive contribution, dM dt In all cases the walls were highly permeable to both water and salt. The agreement between the calculated rates and the actual rates indicated that the walls had a low level of selectivity between water and salt flux. The reflection coefficient,σ, is an established indicator of membrane selectivity and has been defined in Sections of the walls from devices described in Example 2 were equilibrated in deionized water for 8 hours to leach out the water soluble pore forming additives. These samples were critical point dried with carbon dioxide by standard methods and viewed with a scanning electron microscope. A typical micrograph is presented in Figure 17. The walls were sponge like in appearance with a distribution of pores that were less than 100 µm in diameter.
