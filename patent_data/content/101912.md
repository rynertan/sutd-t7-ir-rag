# ANTIGEN ASSAY METHOD AND KIT

## Abstract
A method of determining the concentration of an antigen in a sample solution comprising a coating an antigen protein conjugate onto a solid matrix, b conjugating an enzyme to an antibody specific for said antigen, c to a known quantity of a solution containing the antibody enzyme conjugate of b adding a specified quantity of a sample containing an unknown amount of the antigen whose content is to be determined, d acting the coated solid matrix of a with the solution c and incubate so as to effect binding between the antibody and antigen, some of the antigen being that from the sample and some being that on the solid matrix, e removing the solid matrix from the solution and washing, f immersing the solid matrix in a solution containing a known amount of an enzyme substrate which is acted upon by the enzyme so as to effect reaction between the enzyme and enzyme substrate to produce a product, and then separating the solid matrix from the solution of enzyme substrate, and g then measuring the solid matrix and or the solution of enzyme substrate with a pre established standard to indicate the amount of antigen which was in the sample added in c .
