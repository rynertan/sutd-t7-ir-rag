## Description
Specification The present invention relates to a method for stabilizing interferon and to compositions which contain interferon and a saccharide or inorganic salt for stabilizing the interferon. Interferon is a physiologically active substance useful as a therapeutic agent because of its biological activities such as antivirus, anti cancer and like activities. Interferon is classified into type a, type 6, type y, etc., according to the physiological and physicochemical properties, and the origin. Interferon has been produced by incubating cells of animals, in particular, cells of humans, but since the supply of such cells was limited, there has been developed a process for producing interferon which comprises cloning an interferon gene by recombinant DNA technology, introducing it into a microorganism e.g., Escherichia coli, and incubating the microorganism. Interferon is a protein or a sugar protein which is unstable and its biological activity is decreased during clinical application. Heretofore, it is known that pH adjustment, addition of serum albumin, addition of soluble lanthanide or calcium salts U.S. Patent 4,252,791 , addition of polyethylenic nonionic surfactants, antibiotics, carboxylic acid, chelating agents, amino acids, etc. Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application No.102519 1980 , addition of polyethylenic nonionic surfactants, antibiotics, chelating agents, amino acids, etc., addition of acid sugars and addition of sulfur containing reducing agents European Patent Publication No. 80879 , addition of HSA human serum albumin and, subsequently, freeze drying it Progress of Interferon Research, extra issue for Protein, Nucleic Acid and Enzyme, No . 25, p. 358 1981 , Kyoritsu Shuppan , and so forth, are effective for stabilizing interferon.However, there is always a demand for a new method for stabilizing interferon. As the result of intensive studies of a method for stabilizing interferon, it has been found that the stability of interferon is remarkably enhanced by admixing the interferon with an inorganic salt such as sodium chloride, potassium chloride, etc., either alone or in combination with, for example, serum albumin. Further, it has been found that the stability of interferon can also be remarkably increased by bringing interferon into contact with a saccharide alone or admixed with other additives. Examples of interferon used in the present invention include natural interferon, interferon produced by incubation of animal cells, interferon produced by incubation of a microorganism obtained by recombinant DNA technology, etc., and also interferon of any of types a, ss and y may be included. In the present invention, in particular, an excellent effect may be expected with Interferon S hereinafter referred to as G ss IFN obtained by recombinant DNA technology. As the non toxic inorganic salt, alkali metal salt, such as sodium chloride, potassium chloride and lithium chloride, or magnesium chloride is used, and in particular, sodium chloride and potassium chloride are remarkable in the stabilizing effect. In order to stabilize interferon, the inorganic salt is formulated i.e., admixed with the interferon, in an amount of lx l0ll 3 x 10 mole per unit of interferon international unit latest Interferon compiled by Kotaro Rishida, Asahi Science 1981 , preferably, 3xl011 5 x 10 11 mole per unit of interferon. The inorganic salt exhibits a remarkable effect even when used alone and the effect may be even further enhanced by using it in combination with, for example, serum albumin, surfactants, antibiotics, chelating agents, amino acids, etc. The conventional G B IFN freeze dried preparation employing serum albumin as a stabilizer becomes insoluble in water in 7 days or 14 days at 70 C, and its biological activity is reduced to 50 7 whereas a G B IFN preparation containing serum albumin and sodium chloride can be readily dissolved in water in the same period of time, and about 90 of its biological activity remains. Furthermore, the stability of G ss IFN in an aqueous solution is examined by measuring the biological activity of 3 x 106 units ml G B IFN under a temperature condition of 400C. In the case where serum albumin is used, the G IFN activity is reduced to 20 after 6 hours.On the other hand, where serum albumin and sodium chloride are used, 40 the G B IFN activity still remains after 6 hours. As mentioned above, the stabilizing effect is achieved by bringing interferon. into contact with a saccharide. Examples of a useful saccharide include dextran e.g., dextran 40 average molecular weight 40,000 , and dextran 70 average molecular weight 70,000 , chondroitin sulfuric acid, starch, glycogen, inulin, dextrin, alginic acid salts, etc. In order to stabilize interferon, the saccharide is formulated with the interferon in an amount of 5 x10 14 4 x10 12 mole per unit of interferon international unit a value determined based on an international standard sample Latest Interferon 1 in Asahi Science 1981 , preferably, lxl013 2x10 12 mole per unit of interferon. The saccharine exhibits an effect even when used alone, and the effect may be even further enhanced by using it in combination with inorganic salts, surfactants, serum albumin, antibiotics, chelating agents, amino acids, buffers, and the like additives which are non toxic and pharmaceutically acceptable additives. For example, when an inorganic salt e.g., sodium chloride, potassium chloride, magnesium chloride, calcium chloride, etc. is to be used in combination with the saccharide, the amount of the inorganic salt added is 1x10 ÚÚ 3 x10 10 mole per unit of interferon, and the amounts of the other additives may be, more or less, the same as that of the inorganic salt, although the amount to be added is dependent on their molecular weights, etc. Further, the effect of a saccharide to stabilize interferon is more enhanced by storing a preparation containing interferon and a saccharide in a freeze dried state rather than in a solution state. The present invention also relates to compositions which contain interferon, and an inorganic salt or a saccharide. The amount of an inorganic salt or a saccharide to be contained in the compositions is the same as described for the above stabilizing method. Such compositions may incorporate, in addition to the inorganic salts or saccharides, pharmaceutically acceptable preservatives, stabilizers, binding agents, excipients, disintegrating agents, wetting agents, lubricants, coloring agents, aromatic agents, flavoring agents, coating agents, suspending agents, emulsifiers, dissolution aids, buffers, isotonic agents, plasticizers, plastic surfactants, etc. Examples of the present invention are given below.Example 1 1 Preparation of G ss IFN Purified G ss IgN was prepared according to the procedures dessnbe in Ezz nezn Patent Pdb . cXion No. 22t6, published on December 23, 1981 and about 200 mg of serum albumin HSA produced by CRYOSAN or BSA produced bySeikagaku Sogyo was added to about 5 iig of purified G ss IFN. 2 Preparation of Samples Serum albumin and, as a stabilizer, an inorganic salt such as sodium chloride were added to the aforesaidG ss IFN, and the mixture was freeze dried.
