# Microprocessor stepper motor drive.

## Abstract
A microprocessor stepper motor drive uses a single acceleration deceleration profile regardless of the final veloc ity of the device being driven. A first down counter 22 stores the desired final velocity 20 from a microprocessor. An acceleration deceleration profile is stored in a storage device 12 and added to the desired final velocity to produce a smooth velocity profile.
