The resulting compound of the formula 4 is then treated with sodium dithionite and formic acid followed by further treatment with formic acid and formamide at elevated temperatures to afford the compound of Formula 8. Alternative, starting materials of Formula 8 may be prepared according to a modified method ofC. W. Noelland, R. K. Robins in J. Hed. Chem., 5, 55d, 1962 starting with a compound of the Formula S whicn is reacted with an appropriate heteroaryl alkyl amine of Formula 3, then with nitrous acid to form the 5 nitrosopyrimidine, 6, which is reduced and ring closed by treatment witn sodium dithionite, formic acid and formamide as described above. The heteroaryl alkyl amines of Formula 3 are either commercially available or may be prepared by known methods.

III. Scheme 2 Method AEMI18.1 IV. Scheme 3 Method CEMI19.1 Generally, the processes of the present invention as shown in scheme 2 above are as follows A 2 amino 6 chloro 4 pyrimidinol, that may be in the monohydrate form, is suspended in methoxyethanol, in the presence of excess amine or an organic base such as triethylamine. The compound of Formula XXX having n, m, R4, Rg, and Ar as defined above is added to the suspension and heated optimally to a temperature at which the suspension refluxes.Refluxing is continued until thin layer chromatography, for example, with 20 methanol in methylene chloride, shows the reaction producing a compound of Formula XX wherein n, m, R4, Rg, and Ar are as defined above is complete. The reaction mixture having the compound ofFormula XX is then diluted with water and treated with sodium nitrite in the presence of acetic acid. A nitroso of the Formula X again having n, m, R4 Rs, and Ar as defined above is obtained from the treatment by the nitrite as evidenced by a color change and precipitate. The temperature of the treatment is at about room temperature. The treatment mixture having therein the nitroso of Formula X is contacted with sodium dithionite in a solvent mixture such as formamide, formic acid, at a temperature of from 60 90 C, preferably from 7C 80 C The temperature is then raised to the boiling pot of the solvent mixture, approximately 130 140 C for up to an hour, preferably at least 20 minutes, or when the color of the nitroso containing mixture described above disappears and an inorganic salt precipitates. The product of this contact is a compound of the Formula IV wherein n, m, R4, R5, andAr are as defined above. Subsequently, the compound of Formula IV is dried and suspended in an anhydrous solvent such as methanol, ethanol, and the like. The suspension is then treated with a dry acid such as HCl, to form the acid salt shown as, Formula IVa, wherein n, m, R4, R5, and Ar are as defined above, or salt corresponding to the acid used for the treatment. The salt IVa is basified with a concentrated mixture of KH40H and 979 hydrazine to obtain a base of the Formula IVb wherein n, m, R4, R5, and Ar are as defined above. The base is unstable, however, is dried, for example in a vacuum over P205. The dried free base IVb is added to a solution of R6OOCNCS wherein R6 is as defined above. The solution of R6OOCNCS may be prepared by suspending potassium thiocyanate in a solvent such as acetonitrile and treating with slightly less than an equivalent of ClCOOR6 wherein R6 is as defined above at reflux for about one hour, cooled, then stirred to insure all of the alkylchioroformate is reacted before the base IVb is added. The reaction of dried free base rVb with the R6OOCNCS is monitored to completion with thin layer chromatography using silica in 20 methanol in methylene chloride to obtain a compound of Formula II wherein R6, n, m, R4, R5, and Ar is as defined above. A mixture of the compound of Formula II and a coupling agent such as N,N dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, in a solvent such as anhydrous dimethylformamide, is stirred at about room temperature until completion of the reaction is shown by thin layer chromatograph to yield a compound of Formula III wherein R6, n, m,R4, R, and Ar are as defined above. The reaction mixture having the compound ofFormula III and anhydrous potassium carbonate are suspended in a solvent such as anhydrous methanol, and refluxed until thin layer chromatography shows the reaction producing a compound of Formula I wherein R1 is O or OH, R3 is NHCOOR6, wherein R6 is as defined above and n, m, R4, R5, and Ar are as defined above. The compound of Formula I wherein R1, is 0 and OH and R3 is NHCOOR6 may then, if desired be used to produce by known methods a compound ofFormula I wherein R3 is NHR wherein R is as defined above other than COOT. Likewise, a compound of Formula I wherein RI is S or SE may be prepared by known methods from the compounds of Formula I wherein R1 is O or OH. The preparation of compounds IV, II, III, and I may be carried out in one pot. However, separation and purification of each of the compounds IV, II, III, or I may be effected by conventional methods, if desired. Generally the processes of the present invention as shown in Scheme 3 Method C above are as follows A mixture of 2 amino 6 chloropurine, potassium carbonate, and the starting material of the formula shown as 2 in Scheme 3 Method C, that is generally commercially available or can be prepared by methods analogous to those known in the art, are stirred under nitrogen for from about 2 to 48 hours.
