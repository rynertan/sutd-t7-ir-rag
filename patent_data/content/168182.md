# Optical measurement apparatus.

## Abstract
Optical measurement apparatus, for example for the measurement of displacement, comprises a radiation source 2 coupled to an optical fibre 1 connected to a sensing head 12 comprising a Y coupler 8 supplying an optic fibre tip 5 and a parallel path incorporating a delay 10 and terminating in a tip 11. A lens 4 of appropriate focal length is positioned between tip 5 and a reflector 3 to focus light onto reflector 3 so that the amount of light reflected back to tip 5 is a function of the position of the reflector. A signal detector 6 is also coupled to fibre to detect and measure the reflected light. Tip 11 is positioned at the focus of lens 4 so that the light reflected back to tip 11 is independent of the position fo reflector 3. The ratio of the two reflected signals detected in detector 6 is calculated to give the position of reflector 3 with compensa tion for the effects of deterioration of the parts of the apparatus in which there is a common path for the two quantities of light.
