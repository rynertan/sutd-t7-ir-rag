# Endoscopic photographing apparatus.

## Abstract
An endoscopic photographing apparatus comprises an endoscope, an endoscopic camera and a light supply unit. A CPU 21 is incorporated into at least one of the endoscopic camera and light supply unit to discriminate the kind of the other. The CPU 21 achieves its kind discrimination depend ing upon whether a response is present or not after a certain time period since the generation of a flag signal. Further, the CPU 21 achieves its kind discrimination depending upon whether it receives the flag signal or not within a certain time period since the start of its operation.
