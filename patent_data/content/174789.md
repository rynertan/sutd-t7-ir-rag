# Methods of and apparatus for reproducing signals.

## Abstract
In an apparatus for reproducing signals in a plurality of oblique tracks 5A,5B on a recording medium 2 by a rotary head 1A,1B , the signals in the tracks 5A,5B contain a digital information signal in a first predetermined area on the oblique tracks 5A,5B and a tracking control signal including a tracking pilot signal P and an erase signal E in a second predetermined area. When the recorded tracks 5A,5B are reproduced by a rotary playback head 1A,1B having a tracing width greater than the track width, the pilot signals P from the adjacent tracks 5A,5B will be detected and compared in level. A tracking signal for controlling the tracking alignment of the rotary playback head 1A,1B is generated in response to the level comparison, and is adjusted in level response to the level of the tracking control signal.
