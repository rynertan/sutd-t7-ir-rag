# Catalyst and method for producing the catalyst.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a catalyst and a method for producing said catalyst. At least 60 per cent by weight of the catalyst consists of copper oxide, aluminium oxide spinel and 60 100 per cent of the copper present is bound to aluminium oxide as copper oxide, aluminium oxide spinel where the atomic ratio Cu Al 9.25 0.50. The catalyst itself contains 1 20 per cent by weight of zinc oxide which is present in the pores of the spinel. Further amounts of zinc oxide may be admixed mechanically or be present as a coating on the catalyst. The catalyst is expecially well suited for conversion of carbon monoxide with steam. The catalyst is produced by precipitation of copper and aluminium salts at pH 6.0 6.5 during addition of an ammonium or alkali carbonate solution. After filtration and drying, the products is calcined at 750 850 C until it is obtained 60 100 per cent spinel structure. Zinc salt is instroduced in the pores of the spinel, and the product thereby formed is heated up to at least the decomposing temperature for the zink salt which is then converted to zinc oxide. Possible addition of zinc oxide in addition so that introduced to the pores of the spinel may be admixed mechanically.
