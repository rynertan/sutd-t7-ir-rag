# ULTRASONIC FRICTION FUSION METHOD AND APPARATUS

## Abstract
Apparatus and method for securing a thermoplastic strap around a package by compressing the overlapping strap end portions together and moving one of the overlapping end por tions in a transverse direction relative to the other at a very high frequency and small amplitude to melt and fuse the inter face regions therebetween. The transducer used to produce the ultrasonic vibrations is supported solely at its nodal point where it is vibration free.
