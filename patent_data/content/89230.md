## Description
SILVER HALIDE PHOTOGRAPHIC MATERIAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a silver halide photographic material that is designed to produce an image having a minimum quality deterioration and reduced fog. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Recent versions of silver halide photographic materials use more silver than gelatin to improve the photographic characteristics and to make it more compatible with processing steps such as development and fixation. The development step is usually performed rapidly within 20 to 50 seconds at high pHs under elevated temperatures 30 to 400C , and this often causes troubles such as the shedding of layers or scrathing, producing only a photographic image of deteriorated quality. In the manufacture of silver halide photographic materials, there is an increasing demand for shortening the period of drying the silver halide emulsion layer formed on the base.This demand for a shorter drying period or faster coating operation makes drying at low humidities unavoidable. The silver halide photographic material dried quickly at low humidities has a lower degree of hardening than the material dried by the conventional method, and when it is subjected to the subsequent rapid development at elevated temperatures, a photographic image of greatly impaired quality is formed.Many studies have been made on the method of producing silver halide photographic materials that withstand severe conditions employed for rapid processing at elevated temperatures. One typical method is to use a hardener for hardevnmj v gelatin used as a binder in the photographic material. Known hardeners are inorganic compounds such as chrome alum, as well as organic compounds such as aldehyde compounds e.g.formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde , compounds having active halogens as described in U.S. Patent No. 3,288,755, compounds waving reactive ethylenically unsatrated bonds as described in U.S. Patent No. 3,635, 718, epoxy compounds of the type described in U. S. Patent No. 3,091,537, and halogen carboxyaldehydes such as mucochloric acid. But if these hardeners are incorporated in the silver halide photographic material in the amount necessary for making it resistant to rapid processing at increased temperatures, they cause adverse effects on the properties of the photographic material by increasing the fog, decreasing the sensitivity, varying the gradation or reducing the maximum density, or their hardening power changes with time to cause after hardening .Another method for preparing a silver halide photographic material capable of producing a quality image after rapid processing under elevated temperatures is to incorporate more gelatin binder with respect to the amount of silver in the photographic material, but this method either reduces the sensitivity or renders the photographic material less compatible with development, fixing or washing procedures. Therefore, it has long been desired to devise a technique for preparing a silver halide photographic material that forms a high quality image after repid processing at elevated temperatures without increasing the amount of gelatin binder with respect to the silver content. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An object of the present invention is to provide a silver halide photographic material that is free from the defects of the conventional product and which withstands image forming processing under severe conditions such as repid development at elevated temperatures. These objects of the present invention can be accomplished by a silver halide photographic material that contains in one or more of the constituent layers of the photographic material at least one compound of the following formula I and at least one compound selected from amoung compounds of the following formulas II , III and IV EMI3.1 EMI4.1 Wherein A and B are each a group of non metallic atoms necessary to form a hereto ring X is a negative ion e.g. C1 , By , Coo4 or CH3SO3 , R1 is a hydrogen atom, a hydroxyl group, the same or different halogen atoms, an alkyl group which may have a substituent, an aralkyl group which may have a substituent, an alkoxy group which may have a substituent, an acyl group which may have a substituent, a carboxymethyl group which may have a substituent, COOM or S03M group M is a hydrogen atom, an alkali metal atom or an ammonium group R2, R3 and R4 are each a COOM or S03M group M is a hydrogen atom, an alkali metal atom or an ammonium group n and n are each 1, 2 or 3 ns is 1 or 1 2 2 and n3 and n4 are 0 or 1 but they are not both 0. The present invention is characterized by incorporating a compound of formula I and at least one compound which is represented by formulae II , III and IV in combination in a silver halide photographic material. At least one compound of each type may be incorporated in at least one constituent layer, or the two compounds may be incorporated separately in two or more constituent layers on the same side of the support on which the silver halide emulsion layers are formed. The object of the present invention can be achieved in either way.In a preferred embodiment, the compound of formula I hereunder referred to as compound A is added to a silver halide emulsion layers and at least one compwad represented by formulae II , III and iv is incorporated in the same emulsion layer and or a non sensitive layer. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Compounds A used in the silver halide photographic material of the present invention are described in JapanesePatent Publication Nos. 41095 72, 39169 73 and 48172 74 as compounds capable of hardening protein, forming a gelatin hardened image, and hardening vinyl polymers. If compunds A are contained in a silver halide photographic material in such an amount that they exhibit the hardening effect i.e. when they are used as binders , the sensitivity of the photographic material is decreased or its gradation properties impaired. On the other hand, if these cas unds are used in such an amount that they do not exhibit the hardening effect i.e. if they are not used as binders , the decrease in the sensitivity and gradation properties of the photographic material can be prevented, but then the material is prone to cause heavy fogging. Compounds B also used in the present invention are known as stabilizers for inhibiting the occurrence of fog in silver halide photographic materials, but is the photographic material containing these compounds is subjected to rapid processing under severe conditions such as elevated temperatures, only a low quality image is produced. Therefore, canpwnd A and B .have canflictije properties ies but when they are contained in a silver photographic material in combination, it is given good photographic characteristics in that it produces a quality image after rapid processing under elevated temperatures without increasing the degree of binder hardening i.e. reducing the sensitivity or experiencing increased fog. Preferred compunds A are such that groups A and orB of non metallic atoms necessary to form a heterp ring are represented byEMI6.1 wherein R is a hydrogen atom or a lower alkyl group n is 2 or 3.
