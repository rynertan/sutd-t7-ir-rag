## Description
CERAMIC CHIP CARRIER WITH REMOVABLE LEAD FRAME SUPPORT This invention relates to a process for manufacturing a ceramic chip carrier wherein the inner tips of a lead frame are accurately positioned to permit wire bonding to a semiconductor chip by means of automatic wire bonding machinery. In the formation of ceramic chip carriers, lead frames are normally bonded to the ceramic substrate by well known methods with subsequent connections being made to the leads of the lead frame from appropriate pads on semiconductor chips secured to the ceramic substrate. These connections from the pads on the chip to the leads of the lead frame are made manually or by means of automatic wire bonding machinery or by mass bonding techniques using spider tape. The automatic wire bonding machinery is normally computer operated on an x y coordinate basis and it is therefore necessary that the leads of the lead frame be accurately positioned on the substrate so that wiring is run from pads on the semiconductor chip to the appropriate lead on the lead frame. There is disclosed in US A Patent No. 4,141,712 a process for manufacturing a semiconductor chip carrier of the type comprising a ceramic substrate with a lead frame attached thereto, the lead frame comprising a plurality of leads having outer portions which extend to the edge of the substrate and tip portions proximate to the interior region thereof, the tip portions having integral support means attached thereto.This manufacturing process requires that an aperture be provided in a package support to which the lead frame is bonded so that the common support for the tip portions may be removed by punching the support out through the aperture in the package support. In an alternative method, discrete tabs are provided which connect groups of substantially non parallel tip portions. These supports are bent to prevent bonding to the package support and are removed after bonding. A similar process is disclosed in US A Patent No. 4,137,546, where the tabs and tip portions overlie a cavity in the substrate. US A Patent No. 4,012,766 discloses support means in the form of a common rim attached to the tip portions, but this is utilized in an injection molded plastic package having an aperture which permits shearing of the rim. In the above described patents, it is necessary to have an aperture in the member to which the lead frame is attached, where it is desired to have a common support member for the tip portions. The aperture facilitates removal of the support member, but precludes the possibility of bonding the semiconductor chip to a substrate on a common surface with the lead frame. Where tabs connecting tip portions of discrete groups of leads are employed, it is not possible to maintain precise spacing of the groups of leads relative to each other. None of the prior art suggests bonding a copper or copper surfaced lead frame directly to a ceramic substrate, but rather disclose embedding the leads in a glass composition on the substrate or other conventional process. According to the invention, therefore, a chip carrier as defined above is characterized in that the lead frame has a copper surface which is bonded directly to the substrate and the support means comprises a common rim which overlies the substrate and is spaced therefrom. The bonding process simplifies manufacture and assures low thermal and electrical resistance. The common rim assures that all tip portions are accurately spaced relative to each other during the bonding process.The spacing of the rim from the substrate assures that the rim will not be bonded to the substrate during the bonding process. The rim is removed from the lead frame after bonding of the lead frame to the ceramic substrate, and the semiconductor chip is thereafter bonded to the interior region of the substrate. It is also desirable that a ground pad be provided in the event the bottom surface of the semiconductor chip is to be maintained at ground potential. According to one embodiment of the invention, therefore, a ground pad is attached to the support rim and is bonded to the interior region of the substrate prior to removing the rim.The rim is removed by shearing, pinch cutting, etching, or the like. Three embodiments of the invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which FIGURE 1 is a plan view of a first embodiment of a semiconductor chip carrier with the common rim still attached FIGURE 2 is a cross section of the chip carrier of Figure 1 with a cutting element positioned thereabove FIGURE 3 is a plan view of the chip carrier of Figure 1 after the rim has been removed FIGURE 4 is a cross section of the chip carrier ofrigure 1 after the cutting element has severed the rim FIGURE 5 is a plan view of a second embodiment of a chip carrier with a ground pad attached to the common rim FIGURE 6 is a partial plan view of the chip carrier of Figure 5 after the rim has been removed FIGURE 7 is an enlarged perspective of a portion of the embodiment shown in Figure 5 FIGURE 8 is a cross section of the chip carrier of Figure 5 taken along tine 8 8 of Figure 7, showing a cutting edge positioned to sever the rim FIGURE 9 is an enlarged perspective of a portion of the embodiment shown in Figure 6 FIGURE 10 is a partial plan view of a third embodiment of a chip carrier having a rim which has extended portions and is bent away from the substrate FIGURE 11 is a cross section of the chip carrier of Figure 10 with a cutting element positioned thereabove and FIGURE 12 is a cross section of the chip carrier of Figure 10 after the cutting element has severed the rim. Referring first to Figure 1, there is shown a ceramic substrate 1 which is formed of alumina, beryllia, or other appropriate material.Positioned on the substrate 1 is a first embodiment of lead frame 3 comprising a plurality of leads having outer portions 5 which extend to the edges of the substrate 1 and tip portions 7 proximate to the interior region 9 of the substrate 1. The tip portions 7 will ultimately be wire bonded to a semiconductor chip which will be bonded to the interior region 9 in known manner. The lead frame 3 is preferably formed of copper or copper surfaced metal and is oxidized on the surface adjacent the ceramic substrate. The lead frame is then bonded to the ceramic substrate by the procedure described in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,744,120 Burgess et al , 3,766,634 Babcock et al , 3,854,892 Burgess et al , 3,911,553 Burgess et al , 3,994,430 Cusano et al , and 4,129,243 Cusano et al . After firing and bonding the lead frame 3 to the substrate 1, the common support rim 13 is removed.In order to prevent relative movement of the tip portions 7 during the bonding procedure, a common rim 13 is attached to all of the tip portions 7. As shown in Figure 2, each tip portion 7 has a reduced thickness portion 11, which is attached to the common support rim 13 which is also of reduced thickness. This configuration prevents the reduced thickness portions 11 of the tip portions 7 and the rim 13 from being in contact with the substrate 1 during the bonding procedure. After the firing takes place which bonds the lead frame 3 to the substrate 1 in accordance with the teachings of the above noted patents, the rim 13 is removed by shearing element 17. The rim 13 may also be removed by pinch cutting, etching, or the like. Figure 3 shows the lead frame 3 as bonded to the substrate 1 after the rim 13 Figure 1 has been removed. The tip portions 7 have the same relative spacing as before firing and are properly positioned and available for bonding of wires thereto by automatic wire bonding machinery. Figure 4 shows a cross section through Figure 3 after the rim 13 has been severed by the shearing element 17. Figure 5 is a plan view of a second embodiment of lead frame 3 which further includes a ground pad 10 attached to support rim 13 by means of tabs 14. As in the first embodiment described in conjunction with Figures 1 through 4, the lead frame 3 and ground pad 10 are formed of copper or copper surfaced metal and are bonded to the substrate by the procedure described in the above noted patents. The ground pad 10 is in the form of a grid capable of passing gases therethrough which may form during the bonding process. The passage of gas through the grid prevents formation of blisters between the ground pad 10 and the interior region 9. Figure 6 is a partial plan view of the chip carrier after the support rim 13 has been removed. Figure 7 is a partial perspective showing the tip portions 7 and ground pad jO as bonded to the substrate, prior to removal of support rim 13. As in the first embodiment described in conjunction with Figure 1 through 4, the tip portions 7 have reduced thickness portions 11, which are integral with common rim 13 which is also of reduced thickness, as are tabs 14. This thickness is about one half that of the remainder of the lead frame excepting the ground pad 10, which is also of reduced thickness. The actual thickness of the temporary support rim 13 is determined by the dimensions of the lead frame 3 involved. As a practical matter, the thickness of the support 13 must be such that it will not sag sufficiently during the bonding procedure to come in contact with the ceramic substrate 1. Figure 8 depicts a shearing element 17 which will sever the temporary support rim 13 from tabs 14 and the tip portions 7. The resulting lead frame is shown in partial perspective in Figure 9. Figure 10 is a partial plan view of a third embodiment of a lead frame having tip portions 7 and a common support rim 23 having extended portions 15 which connect substantially non parallel tip portions 7. The tip portions 7 have raised portions 21 proximate to the rim 23 which prevent the rim 23 from bonding to the substrate 1 when the lead frame is bonded thereto in accordance with the procedure set forth in the above noted patents. The extended portions 15 prevent movement of the tip portions 7 from their initial position as the rim 23 is bent upward from the substrate 1 prior to lead frame attachment. The extended portions 15 undergo deformation which permits an increase in the perimeter of rim 13 which occurs only in the extended portions 15 and is not uniformly distributed around the perimeter. Thus the tip portions 7 will remain in their initial position after bending the rim 23 and will be accurately positioned for subsequent wire bonding. Figure 11 shows a pinch cutting element 17 prior to severing the temporary support rim 23 and raised portions 21 from the remainder of tip portions 7, which are bonded to the substrate 1. Figure 12 is a similar view to Figure 11 after the rim 23 has been severed, leaving the tip portions 7 suitably positioned for automatic wire bonding. Several methods have been described whereby lead frames can be positioned on ceramic substrates with the leads on the lead frame retaining their relative positions during the bonding operation, and whereby a ground pad can be provided which is positively positioned relative to the lead frame.
