# Side lifting apparatus.

## Abstract
In a side lifting apparatus for detachable connection to a container 7 from the side, which comprises a horizontal main girder 1 and two downwardly directed locking pins 24, 25 arranged turnably in bearing housings 22, 23 to be brought into locking engagement with top corner fittings 31, 32 of the container, it is suggested according to the invention to arrange at the ends of the main girder 1 two vertical columns 2, 3 carrying said bearing housings 22, 23 and locking pins 24, 25 and comprising an upper member 16 17 carrying the locking pin 24 25 , and a lower member 14 15 rigidly mounted to the horizontal main girder 1 , said two members 14, 16 15, 17 of each column 2 3 being axially displaceable in relation to each other in order to alter the distance of the locking pin 24 25 to the main girder 1 . When handling an inclined container 7 , the locking pins 24 25 are arranged by extending the column 2, 3 in question, to be set at different levels in relation to each other, said difference in levels corresponding to the inclination of the container.
