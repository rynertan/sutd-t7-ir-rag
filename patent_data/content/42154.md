The mixture was poured into cold diisopropyl ether 20 ml under stirring and resulting precipitates were collected by filtration.The powder was suspended in water 18 ml , adjusted to pH 4 to 5 with aqueous solution of sodium bicarbonate and an insoluble material was filtered off. The filtrate was subjected to column chromatography on a non ionic adsorption resin Diaion HP 20 TrademarkPrepared by Mitsubishi Chemical Industries 20 ml .After the column was washed with water, the elution was carried out with 208 aqueous methanol.
