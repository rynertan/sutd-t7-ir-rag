## Description
Short title Method and device for measuring and dispensing powder at a preselected rate. powder at a preselected rate. The invention relates to a method and a device for dispensing powder at a preselected rate. Such a method and such a device are, in general, of interest for use in works in which predetermined powder doses are added to the raw material in order to improve procesvsing of said raw material for a desired product or to impart a given consistency or colour to the product and they are particularly interesting for brick works in which very finely comminuted manganese oxide MnO2 is added to the clay or other raw material for the bricks in order to colour the bricks to be produced.In particular, accurate dosing of the fine MnO2 powder, which is in a very dry state in behalf of transport and doing when supplied to the user or dosing of said powder in the mixing and kneading device gives rise to difficulties during the transport of the raw material for the bricks to be made to said device, since unacceptable dust clouds are formed in the air around the dosing area. The invention has for its object to provide a method and a device by which the difficulties hitherto experienced in dosing and admixing of the powder required for the product to be made are obviated. According to the invention this is achieved in the first place by using a method in which dry powder is passed from a feedstock or bunker in a predetermined flow through a dust tight space, in which space it is wetted. In this case dosing is carried out in a dusttight space and the powder is spread only in the moist state on the raw material for the product to be made and passed along herewith or it is shed in a mixing and kneading machine or other processing device, which is open at the top.In the moist state the powder wtll not disperse so that the ambient air will not be dust laden. According to the invention i t i Rdva,nta,geous t9 proceed so that from a first compartment of the dustvttght space communicating with the feedstock or the bunker the dry powder is passed, for example, in metered portions to a second compartment of said space for wetting the powder.Dosing is then carried out after the powder is introduced into the closed space and before t is wetted. Dosing of the powder can be facilitated and performed with greater accuracy when the powder is fluidized in the first compartment of the dust tight space. In this way formation of lumps and bridges in the powder mass Xn the dust tight space preceding the dosing device ts avoided. The device for carrying out the method according to the invention may be characterized bysa supply vessel or bunker for the dry powder, a dust tight space communicating with the former, wetting means contained in said space, a dosing device between the place of the wetting means in said space and the supply vessel o r the bunker and by transport means for conducting moist powder out of the dusttight space.Advantageously the dust tight space may then comprtse a first compartment communicating with the supply vessel or the bunker and a second compartment provided with the wetting means and being connected with the transport means for the evacuation of moist powder and the dosing device may be arranged between said two compartments. When it ts ensured that the first compartment remains filled with powder to a given level, the dosing device will invariably receive an adequate amount of powder. In order to facilitate and improve the precision of dosing it is advisable to provide a device for fluidizing the dry powder contained in the first compartment of the dust tight space. The fluidized powder can be readily passed to a measuring recipient for dosing. The fluidizing device may be designed to pass a rising gas stream, for example, an air stream across the mass of dry powder contained in the first compartment of the dust tight space. In order to allow the gas blown into the first compartment for fluidizing the powder mass to escape dustfree therefrom, at least part of the compartment wall extending above the fluidized mass of dry powder contained in the first compartment of the dusttight space during operation ma consist of filter cloth. Part of the wall of the second compartment of the dust tight space located between the dosing device and the wetting means may likewise consist of filter cloth. If subsequent to dosing the powder still contains gas, the gas can as yet escape from the second compartment in a dust free state. Moreover, no air can enter from the outside. The dosing device mar comprise a sluice vessel having an inlet orifice to be closed by a first flap and an outlet orifice to be closed by a second flap and means for alternately and consecutivelS opening and closing said flap with a predetermined delay. Dosing is thus carried out batchwise with the aid of a measuring recipient which is alternately filled and emptied. The dosing device for metering and passing on the powder may, as an alternative be designed as a tourniquet sluice. Such a device operates without flaps so that the construction is simpler and filling and emptying of the sluice cells can be performed more rapidly. The part of the dust tight space comprising the wetting means may be constructed in the form of a shakeahle vessel containing discrete metal bodDes such such as grains, lumps or pellets and having in its bottom or at the edge thereof in a standing wall at least one outlet orifice, which is large enough for passing the moist powder, but too narrow for passing bodies. The invention will be explained more fully with reference to the embodiments of a powder dosing and wetting device shown in the drawing. The drawing shows in Fig. 1 a vertical sectional view of a powder dosing and wetting device embodying the invention, Fig. 2 a vertical sectional view of a variant of part of the device shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 3 a vertical sectional view of a variant of a further part of the device of Fig. 1. The device shown in Fig. 1 comprises a supply vessel or bunker 1 containing dry powder, for example, manganese oxide MnO2 for the brick industry. This supply vessel communicates though a conduit 2 including a closing member not shown with a first compartment 4 in the upper part of a vessel designated generally by 3, having a dusttight space, said compartment communicating through a tourniquet sluice 5 having cells 6 of given capacity with a compartment 7 provided in the lower part of the vessel 3 and having a worm conveyor 8 and a wetting device 10 connected with a fluid pipe 9, for example, a water conduit. At the top the compartment 4 is closed in dusttight manner by means of an inverted bag 11 of filter cloth, which permits air or another gas to pass but does not pass powder and dust. The compartment 4 accommodates the sensor 12 of a level control not shown , which ensures by opening and closing the closing member in the conduit 2 that the level of the powder poured into the compartment 4 from the supply vessel or the bunker 1 remains substantially the same. The wall of the funnel shaped bottom of the compartment 4 adjacent the tourniquet sluice 5 is covered by a porous mass 13, across which gas air supplied through ducts 14 is introduced by pressure. This gas or air serves to fluidize the powder mass contained in the compartment. The fluidization facilitates the flow of the powder and the cells 6 of the sluice 5 can thus be filled more accurately with powder so that dosing is improved. The sluice 5 ejects each time an accurately metered powder portion into the second compartment 7, in which the worm conveyor 8 passes the dry powder on below the wetting device 10. Then the moist powder, which is no longer likely to whirl up dust, is conducted away by the worm conveyor 8 and poured into the conveyor belt 15, which passes the powder to a processing device, for example, the mixing and kneading machine of the brick works. Part of the wall of the second compartment 7 consists of filter cloth 16, through which gas or air can escape in a dust free state by excess pressure, whilst at any subatmospheric pressure caused by the worm conveyor 8 the air can flow in. The device shown in Fig. 2 differs from that ofFig. 1 in that the worm conveyor 8 in the compartment 7 is replaced by an inclined, shakeable trough 17 provided with the wetting device 9, 10 and containing balls 18. The trough 17 is arranged on pivotable supports 19 and it can be shaken to and fro a crank 20 and a crank shaft 22 driven by a motor having a flrheel 21. At the lower end the trough 17 has an outlet orifice 23, which can pass the moist powder, but which is too narrow for the balls 18. Fig. 3 shows a powder dosing and wetting device which corresponds with the device of Fig. 1 with the exception of the construction of the dosing device. In this device dosing is not performed by means of a tourniquet sluice with cells as in Fig. 1, but means of a measuring recipient 24 having an inlet orifice 26 that can be closed by a flap 25 ànd an outlet orifice 28 that can be closed by another flap 27.The flaps 25 and 27 are rigidly connected with one another in a manner such that when one orifice is opened the other orifice is closed. The flaps 25 and 27 are fastened to a common flap stem 29, which can be hydraulically or pneumatically moved up and down by a double acting cylinder 30 with a piston 31.
