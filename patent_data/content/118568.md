# SEMICONDUCTOR IMAGE PICKUP DEVICE.

## Abstract
A semiconductor image pickup device of a static induc tion phototransistor type comprises a control gate region 20 in a first gate region for control, and a shielding gate region 21 in a second gate region. A distance W₁ between an n type source region 3 and a control gate region 2 , and a distance W₂ between the n type source region 3 and a the shielding gate region 21 have the relationship W₁ W₂. A shielding mask 22 may be provided over the shielding gate region 21 . Thus the separation between adjacent photocells can be improved, thereby markedly improving their integration.
