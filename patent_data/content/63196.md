# TRANSPARENCY VIEWER

## Abstract
A transparencv viewer comprises a framework 10 having an array of apertures 14 through which mounted transparen cies 39, received in a corresponding array of recesses 36 in a translucent tray 34, are viewed. The loaded tray 34 is slidable from the framework 10 and can readily be replaced by a different loaded tray. A viewing lens member 22 has a foot 52 at each corner engaging a guideway system made up of an outer rim 24 of the framework 10 and grooves 21 formed by flanges 20 on collars 18 which are a snap fit around the apertures 14. In this way, the lens member 22 can be moved along any rank or file of apertures 14 into registration with a chosen transparency. Gaps 26 in the rim 24 allow the lens member 22 to be removed from the framework 10 at one point only.
