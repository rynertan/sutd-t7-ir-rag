# SOUND SYNCHRONIZED SLIDE PROJECTOR AND SOUND SYNCHRONIZING DEVICE FOR SLIDE PROJECTORS

## Abstract
The invention relates to a sound synchronizing device suitable for being easily built in or connected to photo graphic slide projectors, comprising a continuous sine wave oscillator and a sine wave modificator, cooperating to generate a recordable signal, and a detector for sine wave signals, comprising a filtering device for the sine wave frequency generated by the sine wave oscillator, said de tector being able to read, amplify and modify said signal, and thereby actuate the slide change control device of the slide projector. The invention also relates to apparatuses for the pro jection of photographic slides, comprising such sound synchronizing device.
