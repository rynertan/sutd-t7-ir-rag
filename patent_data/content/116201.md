## Description
Hybrid DNA technology has revolutionized the ability to produce polypeptides of an infinite variety of compositions. Since living forms are composed of proteins and employ proteins for regulation, the ability to duplicate these proteins at will offers unique opportunities for investigating the manner in which these proteins function and the use of such proteins, fragments of such proteins, or analogs in therapy and diagnosis. There have been numerous advances in improving the rate and amount of protein produced by a cell. Most of these advances have been associated with higher copy numbers, more efficient promoters, and means for reducing the amount of degradation of the desired product. Is is evident that it would be extremely desirable to be able to secrete polypeptides of interest, where such polypeptides are the product of interest. Furthermore, in many situations, the polypeptide of interest does not have an initial methionine amino acid. This is usually a result of there being a processing signal in the gene encoding for the polypeptide of interest, which the gene source recognizes and cleaves with an appropriate peptidase. Since in most situations, genes of interest are heterologous to the host in which the gene is to be expressed, such processing occurs imprecisely and in low yield in the expression host. In this case, while the protein which is obtained will be identical to the peptide of interest for almost all of its sequence, it will differ at the N terminus which can deleteriously affect physiological activity. There are, therefore, many reasons why it would be extremely advantageous to prepare DNA sequences, which would encode for the secretion and maturing of the polypeptide product. Furthermore, where sequences can be found for processing, which result in the removal of amino acids superfluous to the polypeptide of interest, the opportunity exists for having a plurality of DNA sequences, either the same or different, in tandem, which may be encoded on a single transcript. U.S. Patent No. 4,336,336 describes for prokaryotes the use of a leader sequence coding for a non cytoplasmic protein normally transported to or beyond the cell surface, resulting in transfer of the fused protein to the periplasmic space. U.S. Patent No. 4,338,397 describes for prokaryotes using a leader sequence which provides for secretion with cleavage of the leader sequence from the polypeptide sequence of interest. U.S. Patent No. 4,338,397, columns 3 and 4, provide for useful definitions, which definitions are incorporated herein by reference. Kurjan and Herskowitz, Cell 1982 30 933 943 describes a putative α factor precursor containing four tandem copies of mature α factor, describing the sequence and postulating a processing mechanism. Kurjan and Herskowitz, Abstracts of Papers presented at the 1981 Cold Spring Harbor meeting on The Molecular Biology of Yeasts, page 242, in an Abstract entitled, A Putative α Factor Precursor Containing Four Tandem Repeats of Mature α Factor, describe the sequence encoding for the α factor and spacers between two of such sequences. Blair et al., Abstracts of Papers, The subject matter of the invention is defined in the claims. Methods and compositions are provided for producing mature polypeptides. DNA constructs are provided which join the DNA fragments encoding for a yeast leader sequence and processing signal to heterologous genes for secretion and maturation of the polypeptide product. The construct of the DNA encoding for the N terminal cleavable alpha factor leader or fragments or analogs thereof and the DNA sequence encoding for the mature polypeptide product can be joined to appropriate vectors for introduction into yeast or other cell which recognizes the processing signals for production of the desired polypeptide. Other capabilities may also be introduced into the construct for various purposes. Fig. 1 is a flow diagram indicating the construction of pYαEGF 21. Fig. 2 shows sequences at fusions of hEGF to the vector. a. through e. show the sequences at the N terminal region of hEGF, which differ among several constructions and f. shows the C terminal region of hEGF. In accordance with the subject invention, eukaryotic hosts, particularly yeast are employed for the production of mature polypeptides, where such polypeptides may be harvested from a nutrient medium. The polypeptides are produced by employing a DNA construct encoding for an alpha factor leader or fragments or analogs thereof and processing signals joined to a polypeptide of interest, which may be a single polypeptide or a plurality of polypeptides separated by processing signals. The resulting construct encodes for a pre pro polypeptide which will contain the signals for secretion of the pre pro polypeptide and processing of the polypeptide, either intracellularly or extracellularly to the mature poypeptide. According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, there is provided a DNA construct comprising a sequence comprising the formula The constructs of the subject invention will for example have at least the following formula defining a propolypeptide The pro polypeptide has an N terminal processing signal for peptidase removal of the amino acids preceding the amino acids encoded for by Gene . For the most part, the constructs of the subject invention will have at least the following formula The construct when n is 0 will have the following formula Of particular interest is the leader sequence of α factor which is described in Kurjan and Herskowitz, While the above formulas are preferred, it should be understood, that with suppressor mutants, other sequences could be provided which would result in the desired function. Normally, suppressor mutants are not as efficient for expression and, therefore, the above indicated sequence or equivalent sequence encoding for the same amino acid sequence is preferred. To the extent that a mutant will express from a different codon the same amino acids which are expressed by the above sequence, then such alternative sequence could be permitted. The dipeptides which are encoded for by the sequence in the parenthesis will be an acidic amino acid, aspartic or glutamic, preferably glutamic, followed by a neutral amino acid, alanine and proline, particularly alanine. In providing for useful DNA sequences which can be used for cassettes for expression, the following sequence can be conveniently employed Of particular interest is the following construct wherein The coding sequence of Gene may be joined to the terminal T, providing that the coding sequence is in frame with the initiation codon and upon processing the first amino acid will be the correct amino acid for the mature polypeptide. The 3 terminus of Gene can be manipulated much more easily and, therefore, it is desirable to provide a construct which allows for insertion of Gene into a unique restriction site in the construct. Such a construct would provide for a restriction site with insertion of the Gene into the restriction site to be in frame with the initiation codon. Such a construction can be symbolized as follows Illustrative of a sequence having the above formula is where W is the sequence GA and n is 2. Of particular interest is where the sequence encoding the terminal dipeptide is taken together with W to define a linker or connector, which allows for recreation of the terminal sequence defining the dipeptide of the processing signal and encodes for the initial amino acids of Gene , so that the codons are in frame with the initiation codon of the leader. The linker provides for a staggered or butt ended termination, desirably defining a restriction site in conjunction with the successive sequences of the Gene . Upon ligation of the linker with Gene , the codons of Gene will be in frame with the initiation codon of the leader. In this manner, one can employ a synthetic sequence which may be joined to a restriction site in the processing signal sequence to recreate the processing signal, while providing the initial bases of the Gene encoding for the N terminal amino acids. By employing a synthetic sequence, the synthetic linker can be a tailored connector having a convenient restriction site near the 3 terminus and the synthetic connector will then provide for the necessary codons for the 5 terminus of the gene. Alternatively, one could introduce a restriction endonuclease recognition site downstream from the processing signal to allow for cleavage and removal of superfluous bases to provide for ligation of the Gene to the processing signal in frame with the initiation codon. Thus the first codon would encode for the N terminal amino acid of the polypeptide. Where T is the first base of Gene , one could introduce a restriction site where the recognition sequence is downstream from the cleavage site. For example, a The construct provides a portable sequence for insertion into vectors, which provide the desired replication system. As already indicated, in some instances, it may be desirable to replace the wild type promoter associated with the leader sequence with a different promoter. In yeast, promoters involved with enzymes in the glycolytic pathway can provide for high rates of transcription. These promoters are associated with such enzymes as phosphoglucoisomerase, phosphofructokinase, phosphotriose isomerase, phosphoglucomutase, enolase, pyruvic kinase, glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase, and alcohol dehydrogenase. These promoters may be inserted upstream from the leader sequence. The 5 flanking region to the leader sequence may be retained or replaced with the 3 sequence of the alternative promoter. Vectors can be prepared and have been reported which include promoters having convenient restriction sites downstream from the promoter for insertion of such constructs as described above. The final construct will be an episomal element capable of stable maintenance in a host, particularly a fungal host such as yeast. The construct will include one or more replication systems, desirably two replication systems, allowing for maintenance in the expression host and cloning in a prokaryote. In addition, one or more markers for selection will be included, which will allow for selective pressure for maintenance of the episomal element in the host. Furthermore, the episomal element may be a high or low copy number, the copy number generally ranging from about 1 to 200. With high copy number episomal elements, there will generally be at least 10, preferably at least 20, and usually not exceeding about 150, more usually not exceeding about 100 copy number. Depending upon the Gene , either high or low copy numbers may be desirable, depending upon the effect of the episomal element on the host. Where the presence of the expression product of the episomal element may have a deleterious effect on the viability of the host, a low copy number may be indicated. Various hosts may be employed, particularly mutants having desired properties. It should be appreciated that depending upon the rate of production of the expression product of the construct, the processing enzyme may or may not be adequate for processing at that level of production. Therefore, a mutant having enhanced production of the processing enzyme may be indicated or enhanced production of the enzyme may be provided by means of an episomal element. Generally, the production of the enzyme should be of a lower order than the production of the desired expression product. Where one is using α factor for secretion and processing, it would be appropriate to provide for enhanced production of the processing enzyme Dipeptidyl Amino Peptidase A, which appears to be the expression product of Alternatively, there may be situations where intracellular processing is not desired. In this situation, it would be useful to have a Host mutants which provide for controlled regulation of expression may be employed to advantage. For example, with the constructions of the subject invention where a fused protein is expressed, the transformants have slow growth which appears to be a result of toxicity of the fused protein. Thus, by inhibiting expression during growth, the host may be grown to high density before changing the conditions to permissive conditions for expression. A temperature sensitive Furthermore, as already indicated, the Gene may have a plurality of sequences in tandem, either the same or different sequences, with intervening processing signals. In this manner, the product may be processed in whole or in part, with the result that one will obtain the various sequences either by themselves or in tandem for subsequent processing. In many situations, it may be desirable to provide for different sequences, where each of the sequences is a subunit of a particular protein product. The Gene may encode for any type of polypeptide of interest. The polypeptide may be as small as an oligopeptide of 8 amino acids or may be 100,000 daltons or higher. Usually, single chains will be less than about 300,000 daltons, more usually less than about 150,000 daltons. Of particular interest are polypeptides of from about 5,000 to 150,000 daltons, more particularly of about 5,000 to 100,000 daltons. Illustrative polypeptides of interest include hormones and factors, such as growth hormone, somatomedins epidermal growth factor, the endocrine secretions, such as luteinizing hormone, thyroid stimulating hormone, oxytocin, insulin, vasopressin, renin, calcitonin, follicle stimulating hormone, prolactin, etc. hematopoietic factors, e.g. erythropoietin, colony stimulating factor, etc. lymphokines globins globulins, e.g. immunoglobulins albumins interferons, such as α, β and γ repressors enzymes endorphins e.g. β endorphin, enkephalin, dynorphin, etc. Having prepared the episomal elements containing the constructs of this invention, one may then introduce such element into an appropriate host. The manner of introduction is conventional, there being a wide variety of ways to introduce DNA into a host. Conveniently, spheroplasts are prepared employing the procedure of, for example, Hinnen The product may be harvested by any convenient means, purifying the protein by chromatography, electrophoresis, dialysis, solvent solvent extraction, etc. In accordance with the subject invention, one can provide for secretion of a wide variety of polypeptides, so as to greatly enhance product yield, simplify purification, minimize degradation of the desired product, and simplify processing, equipment, and engineering requirements. Furthermore, utilization of nutrients based on productivity can be greatly enhanced, so that more economical and more efficient production of polypeptides may be achieved. Also, the use of yeast has many advantages in avoiding enterotoxins, which may be present with prokaryotes, and employing known techniques, which have been developed for yeast over long periods of time, which techniques include isolation of yeast products. The following examples are offered by way of illustration and not by way of limitation. A synthetic sequence for human epidermal growth factor EGF based on the amino acid sequence of EGF reported by H. Gregory and B.M. Preston Int. J. Peptide Protein Res. where 5 indicates the promoter proximal end of the sequence. The sequence was inserted into the Approximately 30µg of p328EGF 1 was digested with This linker restores the The This linker has two stop codons and joins the The resulting 181 base pair fragment was purified by preparative gel electrophoresis and ligated to 100ng of pAB112 which had been previously completely digested with the enzymes The resulting mixture was used to transform Plasmid pC1 1 is a derivative of pJDB219, Beggs, Nature 1978 275 104, in which the region corresponding to bacterial plasmid pMB9 in pJDB219 has been replaced by pBR322 in pC1 1. This mixture was used to transform Fifty milliliter cultures of yeast strain AB103 For further characterization, human EGF present in the supernatant was purified by absorption to the ion exchange resin Biorex 70 and elution with HCl 10mM in 80 ethanol. After evaporation of the HCl and ethanol the EGF was solubilized in water. This material migrates as a single major protein of MW approx. 6,000 in 17.5 SDS gels, roughly the same as authentic mouse EGF MW 6,000 . This indicates that the α factor leader sequence has been properly excised during the secretion process. Analysis by high resolution liquid chromatography microbondapak C18, Waters column indicates that the product migrates with a retention time similar to an authentic mouse EGF standard. However, protein sequencing by Edman degradation showed that the N terminus retained the glu ala sequence. A number of other constructions were prepared using different constructions for joining hEGF to the These fusions were made as follows. Construction a was made as described above. Construction b was made in a similar way except that linker 2 was used instead of linker 1. Linker 2 modifies the The plasmid pAB114 was derived as follows The resulting yeast plasmid is named pYαEGF 23 and was deposited at the American Type Culture Collection on 12th August 1983 under ATCC Accession no. 40079. Construction d , in which a new Yeast cells transformed with pYαEGF 22 were grown in 15 ml cultures. At the indicated densities or times, cultures were centrifuged and the supernatants saved and kept on ice. The cell pellets were washed in lysis buffer 0.1 Triton X 100, 10mM NaHPO₄ pH 7.5 and broken by vortexing 5min in 1min intervals with cooling on ice in between in one volume of lysis buffer and one volume of glass beads. After centrifugation, the supernatants were collected and kept on ice. The amount of hEGF in the culture medium and cell extracts was measured using the fibroblast receptor binding competition assay. Standard curves were obtained by measuring the effects of increasing quantities of mouse EGF on the binding of a standard amount ¹²⁵I labeled mouse EGF. Proteins were concentrated from the culture media by absorption on Bio Rex 70 resin and elution with 0.01 HCl in 80 ethanol and purified by high performance liquid chromatography HPLC on a reverse phase C18 column. The column was eluted at a flow rate of 4ml min with a linear gradient of 5 to 80 acetonitrile containing 0.2 trifluoroacetic acid in 60min. Proteins 200 800 picomoles were sequenced at the amino terminal end by the Edman degradation method using a gas phase protein sequencer Applied Biosystems model 470A. The normal PROTFA program was used for all the analyses. Dithiothreitol was added to S2 ethyl acetate 20mg liter and S3 butyl chloride 10mg liter immediately before use. All samples were treated with 1N HCl in methanol at 40 for 15min to convert PTH aspartic acid and PTH glutamic acid to their methyl esters. All PTH amino acid identifications were performed by reference to retention times on a IBM CN HPLC column using a known mixture of PTH amino acids as standards. Secretion from pYαEGF 22 gave a 4 1 mole ratio of native N terminus hEGF to glu ala terminated hEGF, while secretion from pYαEGF 23 25 gave only native N terminated hEGF. Yields of hEGF ranged from 5 to 8µg ml measured either as protein or in a receptor binding assay. The strain JRY188 These results indicate that the hybrid In accordance with the subject invention, novel constructs are provided which may be inserted into vectors to provide for expression of polypeptides having an N terminal leader sequence and one or more processing signals to provide for secretion of the polypeptide as well as processing to result in a mature polypeptide product free of superfluous amino acids. Thus, one can obtain a polypeptide having the identical sequence to a naturally occurring polypeptide. In addition, because the polypeptide can be produced in yeast, glycosylation can occur, so that products can be obtained which are identical to the naturally occurring products. Furthermore, because the product is secreted, greatly enhanced yields can be obtained based on cell population and processing and purification are greatly simplified. In addition, employing mutant hosts, expression can be regulated to be turned off or on, as desired. Although the foregoing invention has been described in some detail by way of illustration and example for purposes of clarity of understanding, it will be obvious that certain changes and modifications may be practiced within the scope of the appended claims.
