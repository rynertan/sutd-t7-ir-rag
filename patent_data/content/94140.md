# Data processing system with system bus for transfer of information.

## Abstract
A CPU 10 communicates with various devices on a system bus 11 and communicates with two further groups of devices by way of interfaces 14 and 14A and corres ponding buses 15 and 15A whose timing and control characteristics are different from each other and from those of the system bus 11 . The interface 14 polls the devices which may be on its bus 15 and keeps a record of the de vices actually present. When access to a device is required, the interface 14 provides access via its bus 15 if the de vice is recorded as present on that bus. Otherwise it pro vides a signal to the interface 14A to enable access via the corresponding bus 15A . The bus 11 operates with a two phase cycle and a device requesting access to the bus does so in the first phase of a cycle and asserts a signal prevent ing other devices putting data on the bus. A device putting data on the bus in the second phase asserts a signal locking out other devices and a further signal keeps the bus locked if the time taken for the data transfer is such as to extend into the next operating cycle.
