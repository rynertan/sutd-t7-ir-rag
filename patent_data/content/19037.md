# Improved tubesheet and tubesheet hollow fibre assembly for high temperature battery cells, and method of manufacturing same.

## Abstract
A small amount of SiO₂ is added to a sodium borate solder glass for making tubesheets in hollow fiber, high temperature battery cells. The glass is more easily ground and has a lower softening temperature. When the powdered glass is fused, to form the tubesheet and sealingly engage the fibers 3 , the fiber weakening fluxing action of the glass is considerably reduced. The invention also resides in a method of making the tubesheet whereby the internal structure is modified so that it has a closed upper surface 2 while the underlying structure of the tubesheet is more open or porous 1 .

## Description
IMPROVED TUBESHEET FOR HOLLOW FIBER TYPE, HIGHTEMPERATURE BATTERY CELLS AND METHOD OF FABRICATING THE SAME High temperature battery cells most notably sodium sulfur battery cells in which the electrolyte separator takes the form of a plurality of cation permeable hollow fibers or tubules, are now well known.See, for example, U.S. Patents 3,476,062 3,672,995 3,679,480 3,703,412 3,749,603 3,765,944 3,791,868 3,829,331 3,917,490 and 4,050,915. In a typical Na S battery cell, the electrolyte separator takes the form of a plurality of generally parallel, Na ion permeable tubules or hollow fibers, each fiber being open at one end and closed at the other end. The open ends terminate in the upper surface of a horizontal, disc like tubesheet or wall member, through which the fibers pass in sealing engagement and from the lower surface of which the fibers depend as closed ended portions. It is a difficult problem to devise or find a specific tubesheet material which is suitable for use with a given specific fiber material under a particular set of conditions. To be suitable for such use, the candidate material must meet each of some seven different requirements. In a sodium sulfur battery cell, for instance, the tubesheet material must be inert to not detrimentally reactive to an intolerable extent with both sodium and sulfur sodium polysulfide mixtures, at temperatures of up to at least 3250C. It must also be electronically non conducting. Further, the candidate material must be reducible to a finely ground powder which, in turn, can be slurried with a readily evaporated or decomposed liquid vehicle to form a viscous, yet extrudeable, paste.In addition, the powder residue left after the vehicle has been removed must have enough coherence to maintain the shape that was imposed on the slurry. The powder must also be fusible, to form a rigid, fluid tight wall member sealingly bonded to the fibers, at a temperature such that the fibers do not become appreciably distorted in the length of time required to effect the fusion. Finally, the thermal coefficients of expansion of the fiber and tubesheet materials must substantially match, at least over the range of temperatures at which the cells are made, stored and used. It has now been recognized that still another requirement must be met, if breakage of fibers in tubesheet fiber assemblies is to be minimized. That is, the tubesheet material should not flux the fibers in such manner or to such an extent that they are markedly weakened where they emerge from the tubesheet. The most satisfactory combination of fiber and tubesheet materials previously found for use in high temperature Na S battery cells was that in which the fibers have compositions essentially as disclosed in U.S. Patents 3,829,331 and 4,050,915 and the tubesheet composition is essentially that disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,197,490. Typical such fiber and tubesheet compositions are Fibers Na2O, 2B203, 0.16 NaCl, 0.2 SiO2 Tubesheet Na2O, 13,88 B203. A number of reasonably long lived sodium sulfur cells have been made with the foregoing materials. However, cells of this type often fail prematurely and the apparent cause of failure frequently is breakage of some of the fibers where they emerge from the tubesheet.It is believed that the fibers are embrittled and or weakened by a fluxing action of the molten tubesheet material during the fusion step. Of course, weakening of the fibers in the foregoing manner also greatly increases the susceptibility of the fibers to breakage during cell assembly. When an alternative, otherwise suitable, tubesheet material Na20, 18.80 B203 was employed, similar results were experienced, i.e., the fluxing problem was not solved. Thus, a need for a tubesheet material which meets all of the other requirements listed above, but which does not so severely flux the fibers, is apparent. The sodium borate tubesheet glasses previously used are soft and quite difficult to adequately grind.The use of special grinding agents and techniques see the cited 490 patent is required. An easier to grind tubesheet material is also highly desirable. Sodium borosilicate glasses of widely varying proportions of sodium, silicon and boron oxides are well known. However, such glasses are not obvious candidate tubesheet materials. The addition of SiO2 to the sodium borate tubesheet materials might improve their grindability but also would tend to make them more nearly resemble the fiber composition thereby perhaps increasing, rather than decreasing, the tendency for fluxing to occur. It is also highly important, in handling tubesheet hollow fiber assemblies, to avoid breaking off even one of the fibers, which are exceedingly small and fragile. It was conceived that the breakage tendency could be reduced if the flexure of the fiber, where it emerges from the bottom of the tubesheet, could be made less abrupt, i.e., could be distributed over a portion of the fiber length, rather than concentrated at the point of emergence. An ideal but difficult to attain improvement would be to have each fiber emerge from its own well in the lower tubesheet surface having the general shape of a trumpet bell.However, a further consideration is that a fluxing action of the tubesheet material on the fiber walls during densification fusing of the tubesheet apparently augments the tendency of the pendant fiber portions to break off, and this would not be eliminated by the latter improvement. A modification which would appear to approach the ideal shape of the lower tubesheet surface and also to move the zone of fiber weakening up into the tubesheet body where it is of much less concern is to minimize the degree of contact between the fiber walls and a bottom portion layer of the tubesheet material.This might be done by utilizing a more open internal tubesheet structure. However, maintaining the essential impermeability of the tubesheet and sealingly engaging it with the fibers then become serious problems. Accordingly, the invention provides an improved tubesheet material which not only meets all the known requirements for hollow fiber type, high temperature battery cells but also has a considerably less deleterious effect on the resistance of the fibers to breakage. The invention also provides an improved tubesheet fiber assembly comprising a wall member composed of the latter material. The invention further provides a tubesheet material which is more easily ground but also has a lower softening temperature. Additionally, the fiber breakage experienced in assembling and operating hollow fiber type, high temperature battery cells, is considerably reduced with the tubesheet of the present invention. The present invention also provides a high temperature, hollow fiber type battery cell in which the fibers have a reduced tendency to break off where they emerge from the tubesheet. The present invention also resides in an improved tubesheet hollow fiber assembly whereby the tendency of the fibers to break off is reduced but the essential impermeability of the assembly is retained.More specifically, the invention provides for a relatively simple, straight forward and easily controlled process for fabricating the improved assembly. As a corrolary, the present invention reduces the necessity for plugging, or otherwise remedying, broken fiber ends in completed tubesheet fiber assemblies. The foregoing improvement in tubesheet fiber assemblies are achieved without departing from the use of tubesheet materials already proven to be suitable as to coefficient of expansion match with the fibers, strength, melting point, etc. . It has now been found that the foregoing improvements can be attained with tubesheet hollow fiber assemblies in which the tubesheet comprises a wall member composed of sodium borate glass compositions containing up to about 8 mole of SiO2 and the fibers are of a ceramic material compatible with the tube sheet glass. The present invention may be more particularly defined as a tubesheet for use in a high temperature hollow fiber battery cell comprising a glass having the composition Na2O, from 1 to 6.1 mole six2, from 2.5 to 7.5 mole and B203, from about 86.5 to about 96.5 mole . The present invention may also be defined as a tubesheet hollow fiber assembly comprising a wall member with which a plurality of hollow fiber lengths passing therethrough are engaged, said wall member comprising a glass having the composition Na2O, from 1 to 6.1 mole Six2, from 2.5 to 7.5 mole and B203, from 86.5 to 96.5 mole and said fibers being composed of a ceramic which has a distortion temperature higher than the fusion temperature of said glass, has a thermal coefficient of expansion which within the range from 250C up to its transi tion temperature does not differ from that of said glass by more than 10x10 7 units C, and is capable of sealingly bonding with said glass at said fusion temperature without being fluxed by the glass to such an extent that the flex strength of said fibers is reduced by more than 50 . It has also been discovered that the internal structure of the tubesheet can be modified so that it has a closed helium tight upper surface but the underlying structure is more open or porous. This is done by broiling the uppermost layer of a tubesheet to be which consists essentially of sintered edge and or point bonded particles. The structure of a tubesheet hollow fiber assembly is more clearly depicted in Figure 1 of the drawing as a considerably enlarged, vertical cross section of a portion of the assembly. A ceramic tubesheet not numbered has first and second generally opposed faces 1 and 2, respectively pierced by a plurality of hollow fibers 3 having closed ends 4 depending from the lower surface 1 of the tubesheet and open ends 5 terminating in the upper surface 2 . The latter surface is defined by a fused, impervious upper layer 6 of the tubesheet material and the lower surface is defined by the lowermost of a body of edge and point bonded particles 7 , of the same material, which make up the rest of the tubesheet. More precisely, the article assembly of the present invention may be described as a helium tight tubesheet fiber assembly comprising a ceramic tubesheet which has first and second generally opposed faces and is pierced by a plurality of inorganic hollow fibers having closed ended sections extending from said first face and open ends terminating in or beyond said second face, the portion of said tubesheet subjacent to and defining said second face being non porous and sealingly engaged with the fibers, the remainder of the tube sheet being contiguous with said portion but not itself sealingly engaged with the fibers, and consisting essentially of sintered particles having the same chemical composition as said portion. It should be noted that the foregoing definition is not limited to fluid impermeable or ion permeable fibers or to assemblies in which the tubesheet or wall member has been cured or fired . Certain of the terms employed in the description are defined as follows The wall member may consist, at one extreme, of discrete particles of the tubesheet glass cohered by secondary bonding forces and mechanical interlocking.At the other extreme, the wall member may be a monolithic body of the glass, formed by particle fusion or otherwise . Between these extremes, the particles may be fused to each other at edges and points, as by sintering, or may be held together by a minor amount of a cement or adhesive which can be removed prior to the fusion step. The term engaged applies to any interaction between the fibers and the wall member which resists motion of the fibers relative to the wall member or vice versa . Inorganic hollow fiber a capillary tubule having an outer diameter of less than 6500 microns and consisting of an inorganic material. Intended to include graphite, ceramics or any other such high melting material having a comparably low heat conductivity. For the purposes of the present application, such fibers are considered fragile if they have the character of ordinary glass, that is, if they cannot be sharply flexed without breaking. A preferred assembly of the present invention is one in which the recited tubesheet is the only tubesheet comprised in the assembly. However, the invention is not limited to single tubesheet assemblies. That is, the closed ended sections of the fibers may penetrate into or pass through a second tube sheet which is spaced apart from the first and is not necessarily sealingly engaged with the fibers or otherwise identical to the first tubesheet. When the fibers terminate within the second tubesheet, their ends therein may be closed by forming a helium tight seal between them and the surrounding tubesheet material. If the closed ends of the fibers extend beyond the second tubesheet, they may later be cut off to adapt the assembly for a use which requires the portions of the fibers between the tubesheets to be unbroken and at least the first tubesheet to be helium tight. The specified hollow fibers are either linear or are generally U shaped loops. If they are linear, they may have two open ends, each terminating at or adjacent to the outer face of a different one of two spaced apart tubesheets, or may have one open end terminating in or adjacent to the outer face of one tubesheet and closed ended portions extending from the inner face thereof. If the fiber lengths are looped, both of their open ends terminate at or adjacent to the outer face of the same tubesheet. The inner face of the tubesheet is that from which the fiber bundle depends or extends. The term ceramic is intended to mean any or all products made from earth by the agency of heat, such as glass, enamels, or cements. The term fluxed means dissolution, leaching, or swelling of the fibers by the wall member material or any exchange of ingredients therebetween. The flex strength of the fibers is the force which must be applied to break off a fiber clamped at one end and free to deflect at the other end, the force being applied at essentially a right angle to the fiber and at a specified distance from the point at which no deflection can occur. Non porous having a closed surface, i.e., a tubesheet surface which has no openings connected to channels through which a fluid may flow intended to include closed cell foam structures. Helium tight having an internal structure such that less than 10 9 cc. of helium measured at standard conditions can diffuse through the tubesheet per second. It should be noted that the rate is an absolute rate and is not expressed in terms of volume of helium per unit of time per unit of area the helium passes through the tubesheet only by way of leaks, at a rate independent of tubesheet area diameter .Wall member Structure and Composition The wall member may consist essentially of particles and thus have a porous structure , so long as those particles are sodium borosilicate particles having a composition which can be represented by the formula Na2O, xSiO2, yB203, wherein x and y have values consistent with the mole percent ranges set out in the preceding definition of the invention. Preferably, the glass from which the wall member is formed has the composition Na20 1.5 4.5 mole 1.9 most preferred SiO2 2.5 4.0 mole 2.9 most preferred B203 92 96 mole 95.2 most preferred . As presently contemplated, the utility of such porous wall members is as intermediate structures which can be converted to non porous, i.e., fluid tight, unitary wall members which are sealingly engaged with the fibers. The sodium borosilicate particles may include dissolved incidental impurities and small amounts of other materials may be present within the interstices between the particles or on their surfaces. Those of the latter materials which are insoluble in the tubesheet glass are of less concern but those which are soluble may have a greater effect on the critical balance of properties which is essential to the functioning of the wall member material during, and after, the fusion step. Consequently, the total amount of soluble impurities which can be tolerated will usually not exceed a few tenths of a percent by weight .Preferably, the content of materials other than the specified borosilicate glass is no more than about a tenth of a percent.slurry Preparation When the wall member is to be formed from a slurry, the solids to liquid ratio in the slurry should be as high as possible, in order to minimize the shrinkage achieved upon fusion of the liquid free particles.This is done by adjusting the particle size distribution of the glass powder used, according to known principles of particle packing Some of the powder particles must have effective diameters of less than 10 microns. Preferably, most of the particles have diameters of less than 2 microns and at least 20 of them are less than 1 micron in diameter . From 40 to 60 parts by weight of the powdered glass is mixed with from 60 to 40 parts of 140 to 325 mesh particles of the same or a different sodium borosilicate glass as specified earlier herein . Preferably, the latter particles are at least generally spherical in shape, to improve the extrudeability of the slurried mixture. If the preceding particle mixture is mixed in turn with from 7 to 14 parts by weight of a volatilizeable non aqueous, liquid suspending vehicle, such as for example cumene, the resulting slurry is fluid enough to be readily extrudeable but viscid enough to hold the shape imposed on it until a complete wall member can be formed and green cured free of volatiles . The grinding method disclosed in the above cited 490 patent is quite suitable for the production of the sodium borosilicate glass powder employed in the practice of the present invention. However, considerably shorter grinding times are required for these glasses than for the sodium borate tubesheet glasses previously used See Example 2, herein .Fibers Composition and Preparation The fibers employed in the present invention can consist of any otherwise suitable material which can be fabricated in hollow fiber form and meets the requirements set forth in the preceding definition. If the fibers are to be employed in a high temperature battery cell, they must also be substantially ion permeable, at least at the normal working temperatures contemplated for that cell. When employed in alkali metal chalcogen cells, the fibers should be sufficiently permeable to cations of the alkali metal that the over all, internal electrical resistance of the cell at its normal operating temperature is acceptably low, for the particular cell use contemplated. The most important application of the present invention now known of is in sodium sulfur battery cells.For this purpose, the fibers necessarily are permeable to Na ions and should have the following properties distortion temperature at least 340 C, thermal coefficient of expansion within the range of from 100 to 130x10 7 units per 0C and electrical Na conductivity of at least 5x105 ohm cm at a temperature of from 280 to 3250C. The material used to make the fibers must be processable in some manner to form the fibers in the first place. The only known practicable method of fabricating ceramic hollow fibers which typically are hairlike and fragile is by melt spinning, essentially in the manner disclosed in the above cited 915 patent. Materials having the compositions disclosed in the latter patent and the above cited 331 patent are generally suitable for the preparation of hollow fibers to be employed in Na S batter cells. The preferred materials for such fibers have the following composition Na2 0 25 34 mole B203 50 66 mole Sio2 0 11 mole NaCl 0 6 mole A more preferred composition for the latter fibers is Na2 29.0 30.5 mole X29.8 most preferred B203 58 60 mole 59.5 most preferred Sio2 5.5 6.5 mole 5.9 most preferred NaCl 4.5 5.5 mole 4.8 most preferred . Because quite small amounts of impurities can markedly alter the ionic conductivity of the fiber material, the requirements in this regard for battery cell fibers are even more stringent than for the wall member material.In general, materials of the foregoing composition which include more than 0.5 by weight of impurities should not be used for the preparation of battery cell fibers preferably, the impurities content is less than 0.1 by weight. As will be apparent to those knowledgeable in the art, the requirements for fibers to be employed in types of devices other than battery cells will differ in some respects. Thus, if the fibers are to be employed, in a permeability separatory device, as a member resistnat to high temperatures and or corrosive materials, they need not be ion conductive but will have to be selectively permeable to at lease one of the materials to be separated. Similarly, fibers of the latter type or microporous ceramic fibers may be advantageously utilized for the introduction to a first fluid stream of a second fluid, as in sparging a gas into a liquid under severe conditions. Ceramic glass fibers adatped to applications of the foregoing types are known see, for example, Nimelnyk andH. B. Habgood, 2Extraction of Helium From Natural Gas. The Diffusion Through Glass Process , Annual Meeting,Petrol. Nat. Gas Division, Edmonton, May, 1960 Canadian Mining Metallurgical Bulletin for October, 1961 Montreal, Canada, pp. 768 774. Selection of Tubesheet and Fiber Material Pairs In selecting the wall member and fiber materials for a given application, it will generally be essential that the match between their thermal coefficients of expansion be such that the assembly can be cooled down, after the fusion step, without fibers breaking or cracks developing in the wall member. However, this does not necessarily require that as close a match as possible be attained. The maximum tolerable extent of mismatch for a given, specific application of course can be determined, by well known methods, without undue experimentation. The following tabulation is indicative of the effect of compositional differences on the thermal coefficient of expansion for sodium borate borosilicate glasses. Softening points and glass transition temperatures are also given for some of the glasses. TABLE I EFFECT OF COMPOSITION ON THERMAL COEFFICIENT OF EXPANSIONGlass Composition Mole s Temp. Trans.

The 325 mesh portion of the milled glass was screened out and gorund essentially in the manner disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,917,490 with 1.5 wt. of n decylamine in a ball mill, at 900C, for 3 days. The resulting powder, when mixed with an equal weight of 140 325 mesh spherical particles of the same composition as the powder and then with 10 by weight of cumene yielded a more easily extruded paste than is obtained with otherwise essentially identical mixtures, the glass powder component of which has been made by ball milling either of the prior art glasses f or h Table I in the same way for 7 10 days. A quantity of hollow fiber, 50 pI.D. by 80 O.D., was spun, essentially as described in U.S.Patent 4,050,915 from glass m Table I . A tubesheet fiber assembly of the type used in experimental 6 ampere hour Na S battery cells was constructed in the manner described earlier herein, using about 3000, 10 cm lengths closed at one end of the fiber. When this assembly was heated for 4 hours at 372 30C, the green tubesheet was cured to a unitary disc about 2 cm in diameter and 0.4 cm thick.The assembly was found as described below to be helium tight and the fibers were found not to have been substantially weakened or embrnttled. In contrast, otherwise essentially identical assemblies prepared from the prior art tubesheet glasses f or h, Table I must be fused cured at temperatures in the range of froma bout 383 4050C in order to be made helium tight and the fibers become quite brittle where they emerge from the lower surface of the wall member. The method used to check the assembly for tubesheet cracks, broken fibers and or imperfect fiber tubesheet bonding is as follows. A commercial helium detector A Varian, Model 925 40, mass spectograph unit which can detect helium flows as small as 10 9 cc S.T.P. per second is connected to the stem of an inverted funnel which is sealingly engaged with the periphery of the wall member and helium gas is discharged just below the wall member, at about the center of the fiber bundle which ordinarily is formed around a hollow mandrel which conveniently functions as a conduit for the helium .The helium flows rasially outward between the fibers and across the lower face to the wall member. If the rate of helium flow through the detector is so low 10 cc sec as not to be detectable, the assembly is considered leak free. A typical helium flow when a leak results from imperfect bonding between the wall member and a single fiber is about 10 7 cc second. Example 3 Retention of Fiber Strength The extent to which fibers of a specific size.and composition are weakened when potted in a specific tubesheet glass can be determined within statistically assessed confidence limits by means of the following procedure which should be carried out in a reproducible, controlled environment, such as is afforded by a dry box or dry room. A 1 cm diameter hole is drilled through a 1.5 cm thick cylindrical test block of a material which does not soften at the glass cure temperature and has a thermal coefficient of expansion which is the same as or not more than 20x10 7 units C greater than that of the glass. The block has a flat lower face to which the axis of the hole is perpendicular and is closely fitted in a flat bottomed cylindrical cavity in a tapered TEFLON stopper. A hole somewhat larger in diameter than the fiber to be tested is drilled through the stopper along the same axis as the hole in the test block. The stopper is tightly inserted in the mouth a tapered, ground glass female joint of a test tube havie a side arm.A length of the fiber, having one end closed, is inserted in the test tube through the small hole until its closed end rests on the test tube bottom and the open end of the fiber extends above the upper surface of the test block. A source of vacuum is connected to the side arm of the test tube and the fiber portion in the test block is potted by filling the space around it the hole in the blcok with the same viscous paste of glass particles and liquid vehicle as is used in preparing tubesheet. A syringe is convenient for the latter operation. An invenrted funnel is fitted over the block and stopper assembly, sealingly engaged with the outer surface of the test tube by means of a gasket and connected to the same vacuum source as the side arm. The vacuum is gradually increased while the assembly is slowly warmed, to remove the liquid component of the paste.The potting material has now been green cured . The vacuum sourse is disconnected and air allowed to bleed slowly into the assembly. The funnel is disengaged from the test tube and the test block and fiber carefully removed from the stopper and test tube. The block, fiber and potting material are now heated in the same manner employed when preparing tubesheets from the glass, thereby curing the potting material i.e., forming a unitary wall member sealingly engaged with the fiber . If desired, the bottom of the wall member can be examined with a microscope and or the asembly tested for leaks as described inExample 2. The block is clamped in a suitable jig with the closed ended portion of the fiber extending down at an angle to the horizontal and tangentially contacting the bottom of an endless groove in the periphery of a small TEFLONS wheel spaced an arbitrary distance from the test block. The vertical position of the wheel is adjusted until the portion of the fiber between the block and the wheel appears to be essentially straight. The distance from the block to the wheel and the angle to the horizontal made by the fiber are measured. The wheel is then gradually raised, along a rectilinear or arced path, as appropriate, until the fiber breaks. Another, esentially identical, length of the fiber is tested in th e same way, except that the potting material used is a comparably viscous resin which is inert to the fiber material and is readily cured to a hard, inflexible material. The ratio of the first distance the wheel has to be moved to break the fiber to the second distance is taken as a measure of the extent to which the fiber retains its strength when the tubesheet glass is fused around it. Of course, a better indication of strength retention is obtained by testing several fiber lengths potted with the tubesheet glass or the resin but contacting the wheel at different initial distances from the test block, and plotting the respective ratios against the latter distances. When the foregoing test is carried out on individual fibers which meet the requirements set forth earlier herein and are potted with tube sheet glasses having the composition specified herein, substantially better strength retention is observed, as compared to the same kind of fibers potted in the prior art glasses glasses f and h, Table I, for example . By substantially better is meant consistently greater than 50 retention usually greater than 70 , as compared to consistently less than 50 usually less than 40 . In a preferred embodiment of the foregoing process invention, the fiber pierced, sintered ceramic particle mass is first formed as a green cured , un sintered, shaped particle mass and then sintered at a temperature below the softening point of the fibers.The sintered mass is then treated to form a fused, impervious upper layer of the tubesheet.Bake and Boil of Tubesheet Hollow Fiber Assmebly According to procedures presently employed, a green cured disc is fired or cured by heating the assembly to degrade and or remove the cement components and any remaining suspension medium and to fuse together the glass or ceramic particles in the disc to form a densified, unitary tubesheet member with which the fiber portions passing through it are bonded in sealing engagement. This is done by supporting the assembly at the tubesheet periphery in an open pyrex container, which in turn is fitted closely within a closed metal casing, connecting the casing to a vacuum pump and placing the casing and contents in a furnace. The disc is heated, essentially by irradiation from and through the pyrex container, to a temperature of about 3400C and kept at that temperature for about 2 hours.It is next further heated in the same manner, for about 4 hours at a final temperature which is about 150 above the glass transition temperature of the tubesheet material but well below the softening temperature of the fiber material, and is then allowed to cool slowly. With a solder glass type of tubesheet materials as disclosed in the above cited 490 patent, for example, the final temperature will range from 3750 to 4000C. In order to modify the latter step to the practice of the present invention, the following require ments must be met. A first requirement for a leak free helium tight tubesheet and fiber assembly is an adequate matc between the coefficients of thermal expansion of the fiber and tubesheet materials. As a general rule, said coefficients should not differ by more than 20x10 7 units per C. Additional requirements for a suitable tubesheet material are 2 it can be formed as a coherent mass of particles which are sinterable at a temperature well below their glass transition tempera ture 3 it can be melted at a temperature below the softening temperature of the fibers 4 the resultant melt must bond with the fibers and 5 the sintered particle mass and fibers must not conduct heat so efficiently as to render impractical the achievement of localized melting, i.e., melting of just the portion of the sintered mass subjacent to and defining the irradiated tubesheet fiber. The first, third and fourth of the foregoing requirements are implied or specifically disclosed in the prior art. However, the second and fifth requirements are novel and a further object of the present invention The heating step in the foregoing procedure is modified, according to the present invention as fol lows. The assembly comprising the tubesheet and fiber is heated or Baked under reduced pressure at a temper ture and for a time such that sintering occurs but sub stantial fusion does not result. Then the upper portie of the sintered particle mass is briefly seared or Broiled at a temperature which Is high enough to cause formation of a fused layer which will effect a tight seal with the fibers when it is allowed to solidify. The sintering may be carried out in any appropriate fashion. One suitable method is simply to employ a low enough temperature in the second stage of heating so that substantial fusion does not occur. Preferably, however, the sintering is accomplished in a single stage operation in which the assembly is heated under diffusion pump vacuum, i.e., at 10 4 to 10 7 torr at the latter temperature for a sufficiently long time to ensure that the particles are well joined edge or point bonded .Thus, the assembly comprising a conventional green cured tubesheet consisting of particles of sodium borate type solder glass 4.5 mole Na2O 95.5 mole B203 or 6 mole Na2O 94 mole B203, for example is maintained at an appropriate temperature 345 or 355o, respectively for four hours. Of course, a finite time is required for the assembly to attain the set furnace temperature, but this is advantageous in that any remaining volatiles can be removed before the sintering temperature is reached, thereby avoiding any tendency for foaming to occur where the material involved in particle bonding becomes relatively plastic . The fusion step also can be carried out in any appropriate fashion. One method would be to supply the heat utilized in sintering the main portion of the tubesheet through a temperature gradient such that the uppermost portion would be at the required fusion temperature. However, this would be more difficult to control and the preferred method is to cool the sintered assembly and then place it in a suitable housing such as a pyrex housing, for example , where a graphite disc of about the same diameter as the tubesheet and about 3.2 mm thick for example is positioned an appropriate distance such as about 2 cm, for example above it on and supported by an intervening, short, vertical VYCOR sleeve. The entire assembly is heated to a temperature above the annealing point of the particles 350 3600C, for example and maintained under nitrogen 0.1 1 atm . A radio frequency induction heating coil is placed around the housing at the level of the graphite disc and used to heat the disc to redness X700 C . The heat radiated from the disc melts the adjacent surface layer of the tubesheet, which can be observed through the housing. When the depth and liquidity of the molten layer is judged by experience to be sufficient after 3.5 minutes, for example , the heating is discontinued and the assembly allowed to cool. Of course, when broiling is accomplished in this manner, the fibers usually will not extend substantially above the uppper second tubesheet surface and must not extend far enough above it to touch the carbon disk or otherwise detrimentally effect the procedure. Presumably as a consequence of minute amounts of gas being trapped in the sintered precursor structure, some foaming occurs in the molten layer formed during the latter operation. However, this does not result in a porous structure as defined earlier herein .That is, the upper layer of the finished tubesheet has the structure of a closed cell foam and is impervious.This is fortunate and somewhat surprising but the present invention of course is not limited to any particular fine structure of the upper layer. All that is necessary is that the layer be non porous and sealingly engaged with the fibers. It will be recognized that the above described sintering and fusion broiling steps can be carried out in the same housing and without opening it between the two operations. That is, the spacing sleeve may be supported other than by resting on the tubesheet periphery and the carbon disc introduced before sintering is commenced. After sintering, the induction coil is positioned around the housing and the broiling step is carried out in situ . It will also be recognized that any other means for producing the radiant heat used to broil the upper tubesheet portion may be employed.That is, the broiling step is not limited to the use of an RF heated carbon disc.Example 4 A relatively large number of Na S battery cells having a nominal rating of 6 ampere hours were made by the above described prior art procedure before the bake and broil method was invented. A comparable number of otherwise essentially identical cells made by the modified procedure of the present invention were compared, as to tightness and operating lifetimes with the prior art cells. A much higher proportion of gas tight cells was obtained using the baRe and broil method of the present invention. Details as to cell components and testing procedures follow. Each cell comprised a cylindrical, 316 stainless steel casing, 1 1 4 in outer diameter by 8 1 2 tall, the bottom of which was internally connected to the cathodic current collector foil roll . The top of the casing was extended, off center, by a length of stainless steel tubing which served first as a catholyte fill port and was then closed and used as the cathode electrical lead from the cell. The tubular, upward extending portion of the anode tank extended through a KOVAR insulating seal at the center of the casing top and functioned first as a sodium fill port and was then closed and used as the anode lead from the cell. The fiber cathode foil spacer tape mandrel and tubesheet assembly comprised about 2000 hollow glass fibers, 80p O.D, x 50 I.D. x about 5 long and a tubsheet disc about 0.2 inch thick x about 0.96 in diameter. The portion of the fiber etc. bundle below the tubesheet was about 0.625 in diameter at the spacer tape level. Most of the space between the bundle and the casing wall was occupied by a 316 stainless steel sleeve which rested on the casing bottom but did not extend up far enough to touch the tubesheet. The cathode foil also did not extend as far as the tubesheet and molten catholyte was able to flow from the fill port between the casing wall and anolyte tank, past the tube sheet and into the spaces between the fibers within the bundle, when the cell was charged. The amounts of catholyte sulfur and sodium charged to the cell were about 25 cc and 15 cc, respectively. The compositions of the fiber and tubesheet glasses in mole ratio were Na20 2B2O3 0 2 NaCl 0.16 Sino2 and 3.9 Na20 92.9 B203 3.2 SiO2 respectively. The softening point of the tubesheet glass is much lower than that of the fiber glass but affords a good match thereto in thermal coefficients of expansion. The fiber, foil, etc. bunder was formed around an aluminum tubing length mandrel by rolling up on it a length of 0.5 ml thick x 4.4 wide aluminum foil on which was disposed a ladder of hollow fibers spaced at 20 per cm and a length of 5 mil x 0.26 wide aluminum spacing tape. The tubesheet material was applied at the nip of the developing roll and adjacent the open ends of the fibers, as a 90 by wt. solids content slurry, in cumene, of a powder consisting of spherical particles about 40p in diameter and less regularly shaped, fine particles having effective diameters of about Sp. The resulting tubesheet fiber etc. assembly was pre dried overnight to remove most of the cumene, and heated in vacuo in such manner that the tubesheet was either fused the prior art procedure or sintered and then 1,broiled1, the present invention . The majority of the prior art cells were made before a helium detector was obtained for leak testing. Prior to that time, a bubble counting device was used for this purpose. The latter device consists essentially of a pressurized nitrogen gas source, a pressure regulator and two vessels connected in series between the regulator and the cell the anolyte fill port, conveniently being tested. The first vessel,A, is relatively large, and acts as an essentially constant pressure reservoir and has a side arm which passes in sealing engagement through the wall of the second smaller vessel, B, and terminates in a capillary tip which opens just below the surface of a small body of liquid such as kerosene at the bottom of B.Nitrogen is charged through a valve to pre purged vessels A and B through A until a preselected pressure 5 psig is attained therein. The valve is then closed.If any nitrogen passes out of B through the tubesheet fiber assembly, it is replaced by a corresponding amount of nitrogen from A, which is seen as bubbles emerging from the capillary tip. Unless the leak is large, no significant change in the AP occurs during the short period of time required to determine the bubble rate. The dimensions of the capillary are such that, at a AP of 5 psig, twenty bubbles are formed per cc of nitrogen gas passed. Thus, a bubble rate of 1 bubble per minute at 5 psig is equivalent to 1 20 0.05 cc of nitrogen per minute. This is about the rate attributable to a single broken fiber or an equivalent leak through the tubesheet or along a tubesheet fiber contact surface . The completed cells designated herein as prior art cells were considered acceptable if their observed leak rates were not greater than 0.5 bubble per minute one N2 bubble every two minutes equivalent to about 0.4 x 10 2 cc of helium per second, at a AP of 1 atmosphere commat 250C . None of the prior art cells tested with the helium detector were helium tight passed less than 10 9 cc sec of helium . Even those cells which were acceptable by the bubble rate criterion exhibited relatively short lifetimes up to about 21 days maximum, when repeatedly subjected to deep charge discharge cycles in a standard testing protocol . Dramatic improvements in acceptance rates and operating lifetime resulted when the tubesheet curing procedure was modified according to the present invention. A high proportion 7 out of a total of about 10 tubesheet fiber etc. assemblies were helium tight as formed. Of these, about 50 survived the stressing inherent in the cell assembly procedure and gave helium tight cells. The operating lifetimes of the latter cells ranged up to as high as 131 days, and post mortem of the failed cells showed that failures were generally not due to anolyte catholyte contact resulting from leaks.
