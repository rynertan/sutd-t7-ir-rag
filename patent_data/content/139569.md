# ARBITRATION MECHANISM FOR ASSIGNING CONTROL OF A COMMUNICATIONS PATH IN A DIGITAL COMPUTER SYSTEM

## Abstract
Devices for interconnection into a digital computer system contain arbitration mechanisms for assigning control of a common communications path among the devices. Several modes of device arbitration are provided for, and the modes may be mixed among devices, and changed during operation of the system, in the system without interfering with communications. The arbitration mechanism requires only a single additional line in the communications pathway, and thus a single additional pin on the integrated circuit on which it is implemented, for the arbitration function. It thus facilitates implementation of the arbitration mechanism along with all other interconnect logic on a single integrated circuit.
