## Description
INHALATION DEVICEThis invention relates to improvements in inhalation devices for aerosol products contained in aerosol con tainers and in particular to an inhalation device especially suited for the oral administration, by inhalation, of medicaments such as bronchodilators and corticosteroids.On inhalation, these medicaments must reach the smallest bronchial tubes in the lungs to get into contact with the endothelial lining, where their medicinal effect is needed for example in the treatment of patients suffering from obstructive bronchitis or asthma. However, many patients on long term inhalation therapy find it difficult to use inhalation devices for medicaments correctly and consequently do not obtain full benefit from the medicament. Ideally, the patient should exhale as far as possible, hold the mouth piece of the inhalation device between his teeth, close his lips and inhale as deeply as possible through the mouth, and, while inhaling, actuate the aerosol container within the inhalation device in order to obtain a metered dose of medicament.If the patient correctly carries out this procedure, the medicament is carried down into the bronchial tubes of the lungs where its therapeutic effect is needed.Unfortunately, many patie nts find it difficult to synchro nise actuating the aerosol container and inhaling the medilament expelled therefrom they may not inhale sufficient ly or even not inhale at all. The result is that the active substance is not inhaled into the lungs but lodges in the mouth or throat instead, where it is ineffective for the treatment of asthma or obstructive bronchitis.It has therefore been proposed The Lancet , December 4 1976 to modify the inhalation device by attaching a whistle or siren to the outside and by blocking any airspaces between the aerosol container and the adjacent part of the housing of the inhalation device. When the patient correctly uses this modified device, the whistle or siren sounds as the air passes through it, and the resulting audible sg nal indicates to the patient that he should press the container in order to receive the metered dose.This modified device unfortunately suffers from a number of disadvantages it is not simple to manufacture it is too bulky and the externally attached whistle or siren can get damaged or broken off if the inhalation device with its aerosol container is simply carried in the pocket or a case along with other articles. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an improved inhalation device that generates an audible signal on correct inhalation, and in part.i ., an improved inhalation device that, in a preferred ej ment, avoids or mitigates the aforesaid disadvantages by having its audible signal generating means in a pc i tion where it cannot be damaged in normal use, by beg simple and cheap to manufacture, and by being no more bulky than the standard known inhalation device.Accordingly, the invention provides an inhalation device comprising a body having a skirt and a head piece, a mouthpiece extending from said head piece and in communication therewith, an air passageway extending through at least part of said body to said mouth piece and providing a path for air to flow into the mouth piece upon inhalation through the mouth piece, and an audible signal generating means, said skirt being adapted to receive and locate an aerosol container of the type having a composition under pressure therein and having metering valve means including a valve stem and associated metering means, the valve stem having an axial discharge tube extending therethrough for discharge of a metered dose upon actuation of said metering valve means by depression of said valve stem, said head piece having actuating means for said metering valve means and a discharge passageway leading to a discharge orifice, said actuating means being engageable wit the valve stem upon location of the container within the skirt and operable to actuate the metering valve means whereby a metered dose is discharged through the valve stem discharge tube and the discharge passageway and discharge orifice into the mouth piece, wherein said audible signal generating means is located in said air passageway within the body and is actuatable upon inhalation through said outh piece when said inhalation device is in engagement ith said container.The actuating means for said metering valve means is preferally a valve stem boss adapted to receive the valve stem within a discharge passageway therein, said discharge passageway having means for limiting entry therein of said valve stem and a discharge orifice communicating with said dlscharge passageway and adapted to discharge said metered dose through said mouth piece.Although the valve stem boss is designed to grip the valve stem of the container, the container is relatively easily dislodged e.g. if the inhalation device is carried loose in the pocket or a case with other articles unless the skirt is long enough to accommodate and protect the container. The skirt therefore should not simply overlap the top part of the container but extend at least half way, preferably at least three quarters of the way, along the container, and thus accommodate the container and hold it snugly inside.The audible signal generating means for convenience hereinafter referred to as sounding device is located preferably inside the head piece or the adjacent part of the skirt where it will neither interfere with the movement of the container necessary to actuate the valve and discharge the metered dose nor obstruct the discharged metered dose, thus preferably in the air path upstream from the di charge orifice. A convenient position is between the Sp Rs reserved for the container and the valve stem boss in pn r ticular the sounding device can be placed adjacent tc ard most preferably abutting against the valve stem boss, nez the junction of the head piece and skirt. In order to provide an air path through the body to the mouth piece, a small hole can be left opposite the mouth piece near the junction of the skirt and head piece, and the sounding device can be located between this hole and the mouth piece. However, preferably one or more channels are provided between the container and the skirt as a path for air to pass into the headpiece and then out of the mouth piece on inhalation.The sounding device is preferably a thin membrane having a vibratory reed or tongue therein. Such a sounding device is cheap and simple to produce, can easily be inserted into and retained in the inhalation device, and does not hinder the normal use of the inhalation device. Moreover, because it fits inside the inhalation device, it does not add to the bulk of the inhalation device and is not subject to damage in normal use. A particularly preferred embodiment of the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a side elevational view of a preferred form of inhalation device, partly in section, andFig. 2 is an enlarged sectional view of the inhalation device taken along line 2 2 of Fig. 1.The inhalation device 1, which is preferably made of rigid or semi rigid plastic material, comprises a skirt 2 and a head piece 3, together constituting a body, and a mouth piece 4. The skirt 2 is designed to receive an aerosol container 5 of standard type, which upon depression of a valve stem 6 dispenses metered doses of medicament through an axial discharge tube therein. In Fig. 1, the container 5 is indle broken lines, since its presence is not necessary to the general description of the invention but only to how the invention is used. The head piece 3 of the inhalation device 1 has a top portion 7 from which a valve stem boss 8 depends. Valve stem boss 8 is adapted to receive and grip valve stem 6 of container 5 by means of a long tudinal discharge passageway 9 therein.This discharge passageway 9 has one or more abutments 10 therein designed to limit the penetration of the valve stem 6 into the boss 8 when pressure is exerted on the opposite end of the container 5. The discharge passageway 9 commu niches with a discharge orifice 11 substantially on the longitudinal axis of the mouth piece 4. The mouth piee can be closed by a cap 20 when the inhalation device 1 is not being used.The inhalation device 1 contains a thin metal membrane 12 abutting against the boss 8. This membrane 12, which is shown in elevation in Fig. 2, has an aperture 13 at its center to receive the valve stem 6, and in particular has a U shaped or rectangular reed or tongue 14 stamped in it. The reed or tonoue 14 is preferably set at a small angle to the plane of the membrane 12 and bent towards the container 5, so that it will vibrate only when the air flows first past the membrane 12 and then out through the mouth piece 4, as in inhalation. This provides a one way sounding device.The skirt 2 of the inhalation device 1 preferably has small ribs 15 protruding therefrom inside, these having the dual function of strengthening the skirt 2 and limiting the sideways movement of the container 5. The membrane 12 is correspondingly notched to accommodate these ribs 15. Normally the membrane 12 will reside comfortably inside the inhalation device 1 without further support, but if desired a number of abutments 17 can be provided in the head piece 3 of the inhalation device 1, e.g.as continuations of the ribs 15. The membrane 12 fits snul side the skirt 2 but has sufficient air gaps around or through it to allow good inhalation by the patient mall gaps, as at 16, are sufficient. If necessary, a small erture or a number of small apertures may be made in the membrane 12. However, the air gaps in or around the membrane must be sufficiently constricted to force an air flow past the reed or tongue 14 during inhalation and thus activate it.The container 5 is circular in cross section, so an air path generally shown by double headed arrows in Fig. 1 is provided between the container 5 and the skirt 2 in the direction of the air gaps 16, and this extends past the membrane 12 and through the head piece 3 and mouth piece So Tne membrane 12 should be sufficiently rigid to allow insert tion into the inhalation device 1 without suffering deforrea tion. It should be made of a readily available cheap metal that can be readily stamped to the desired form, e.g. a moderately hard metal such as hard or semi hard brass. Brass sheet 0.1 to 0.2 mm.thick is very suitable.Reed or tongue 14 may be for example 5 to 20 mm. long, preferably 7 to 15 mm. long and in particular about 9 to 12 mm. long it iay be 2 to 7 mm. wide, more preferably 3 to 5 mm. wise, in particular about 3.5 to 4 mm. wide and it may be about 2 to 4 times as long as it is wide, preferably about 2.5 to 3 times. In order to produce the desired one way sounding as DCWJ as mentioned above, the reed or tongue 14 is preSer b set towards container 5 at a small angle to the plane of the membrane 12. The a le may be for example about 2 to 4 degrees, preferably about 3 degrees for a reed or tongue 9 to 12 mm. long, its free end should be about 0.5 mm. out of the plane of the membrane.If necessary, more than one reed or tongue 14, if desired tuned to different pitches, can be incorporated into the membrane 12.The membrane 12 may be if necessary pigmented or metalplated on one surface so that the two surfaces have a different appearance this provides a visual check that it has been inserted correctly.The membrane 12 can be stamped out on a suitable machine, which can simultaneously set the reed or tongue 14 at the necessary angle for example by means of a slight protrusion on the punch. It can then be inserted into the inhalation device 1. I u3 rg, the inhalation device 1, the patient inserts the container 5 into the skirt 2 he empties his lungs, puts the th piece 4 e into his mouth, grips it with his teat arld c ases his lips He then deeply inhales through the mouth, and presses the container 5 to actuate it when he hears the sound from the membrane 12. He continues inhaling for as long as possible after actuating the container, and then holds his breath as long as possible. The present inhalation device can also be used by a doctor in demonstrating to a patient the importance of synchronizing inhalation through the mouth and actuating the container, so that the patient can better use an unmodified device.
