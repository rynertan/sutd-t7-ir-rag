# Speech analysis synthesis with energy normalization.

## Abstract
Energy normalization in speech synthesis systems is achieved by a look ahead adaptive normalization procedure, wherein energy is adaptively tracked, and the adaptive energy tracking value is used to normalize a much earlier frame s energy value. In another aspect, silence suppression in speech synth esis systems is achieved by detecting and processing only segments of voice activity. A segment is classified as speech if the energy of the signal is greater than an adaptively adjusted threshold. The adaptively adjusted threshold is preferably defined as the maximum of scaled values of two separate envelope parameters, which both track the variation in energy over the sequence of frames of speech data. One contour is a slow rising fast falling value, which is updated only during unvoiced speech frames, and therefore tracks a lower envelope of the energy contour. This parameter in effect tracks an ambient noise level. The other parameter is a fast rising slow falling parameter, which is updated only during voiced speech frames, and thus tracks an upper envelope of the energy contour. This in effect tracks the average speech level.

## Description
Background and Summary of the Invention The present invention relates to voice coding systems. A very large range of applications exists for voice coding systems, including voice mail in microcomputer networks, voice mail sent and received over telephone lines by microcomputers, user programmed synthetic speech, etc. In particular, the requirements of many of these applications are quite different from those of simple speech synthesis applications such as a Speak Spell TM , wherein synthetic speech can be carefully encoded and then stored in a ROM or on disk. In such applications, high speed computers with elaborate algorithms, combined with hand tweaking, can be used to optimize encoded speech for good intelligibility and low bit requirements. However, in many other requirements, the speech encoding step does not have such large resources available. This is most obviously true in voice mail microcomputer networks, but it is also important in applications where a user may wish to generate his own reminder messages, diagnostic messages, signals during program operation, etc.For example, microcomputer system wherein the user could generate synthetic speech messages in his own software would be highly desirable, not only for the individual user, but also for the software production houses which do not have trained speech scientists available. A particular problem in such applications is energy variation. That is, not only will a speaker s voice intensity typically contain a large dynamic range related to sentence inflection, but different speakers will have different volume levels, and the same speaker s voice level may vary widely at different times. Untrained speakers are especially likely to use nonuniform uncontrolled variations in volume, which the listener normally ignores. This large dynamic range would mean that the voice coding method used must accommodate a wide dynamic range, and therefore an increased number of bits would be required for doding at reasonable resolution. However, if energy normalization can be used i.e. all speech adjusted to approximately a constant energy level these problems are ameliorated. Energy normalization also improves the intelligibility of the speech received. That is, the dynamic range available from audio amplifiers and loudspeakers is much less than that which can easily be perceived by the human ear. In fact, the dynamic range of loudspeakers is typically much less than that of microphones. This means that a dynamic range which is perfectly intelligible to a human listener may be hard to understand if communicated through a loudspeaker, even if absolutely perfect encoding and decoding is used. The problem of intelligibility is particularly acute with audio amplifiers and loudspeakers which are not of extremely high fidelity. However, compact low fidelity loudspeakers must be used in most of the most attractive applications for voice analysis synthesis, for reasons of compactness, ruggedness, and economy. A further desideratum is that, in many attractive applications, the person listening to synthesized speech should not be required to twiddle a volume control frequently. Where a volume control is available, dynamic range can be analog adjusted for each received synthetic speech signal, to shift the narrow window provided by the loudspeaker s narrow dynamic range, but this is obviously undesirable for voice mail systems and many other applications. In the prior art, analog automatic gain controls have been used to achieve energy normalization of raw signals.However, analog automatic gain controls distort the signal input to the analog to digital converter. That is, where e.g. reflection coefficients are used to encode speech data, use of an automatic gain control in the analog signal will introduce error into the calculated reflection coefficients. While it is hard to analyze the nature of this error, error is in fact introduced. Moreover, use of an analog automatic gain control requires an analog part, and every introduction of special analog parts into a digital system greatly increases the cost of the digital system. If an AGC circuit having a fast response is used, the energy levels of consecutive allophones may be inappropriate. For example, in the word six the sibilant s will normally show a much lower energy than the vowel i .If a fast response AGC circuit is used, the energy normalized word nSjrX is le ft with a sound extremely hissy, since the initial s will be raised to the same energy as the i , inappropriately. Even if a slower response AGC circuit is used, substantial problems still may exist, such as raising the noise floor up to signal levels during periods of silence, or inadequate limiting of a loud utterance following a silent period. Thus it is an object of the present invention to provide a digital system which can perform energy normÅalization of voice signals. Xt is a further object of the present invention to provide a method for energy normalization of voice signals whsich will naot overemphasize initial constants. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a method for energy normalization of voice signals which can rapidly respond to energy variations in a speaker s utterance, without excessively distorting the relative energy levels of adjacent allophones with an utterance. A further general problem with energy normalization is caused by the existence of noise during silent periods.That is, if an energy normalization system brings the noise floor up towards the expected normal energy level during periods when no speech signal is present, the intelligibility of speech will be degraded and the speech will be unpleasant to listen to. In addition, substantial bandwidth will be wasted encoding noise signals during speech silence periods. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a voice coding system which will not waste bandwidth on encoding noise during silent periods. The present invention solves the problems of energy normalization digitally, by using look ahead energy normalization. That is, an adaptive energy normalization parameter is carried from frame to frame during a speech analysis portion of an analysis synthesis system. Speech frames are buffered for a fairly long period, e.g. F second, and then are normalized according to the current energy normalization parameter. That is, energy normalization is look ahead normalization in that each frame of speech e.g.each 20 millisecond interval of speech is normalized according to the energy normalization value from much later, e.g. from 25 frames later. The energy normalization value is calculated for the frames as received by using a fast rising slow falling peakntracking value. In a further aspect of the present invention, a novel silence suppression scheme is used. Silence suppression is achieved by tracking 2 additional energy contours. One contour is a slow rising fast falling value, which is updated only during unvoiced speech frames, and therefore tracks a lower envelope of the energy contour. This in effect tracks the ambient noise level. The other parameter is a fast rising slow falling parameter, which is updated only during voiced speech frames, and thus tracks an upper envelope of the energy contour. This in effect tracks the average speech level. A threshold value is calculated as the maximum of respective multiples of these 2 parameters, e.g. the greater of 5 times the lower envelope parameter , and one fifth of the upper envelope parameter . Speech is not considered to have begun unless a first frame which both has an energy above the threshold level and is also voiced is detected. In that case, the system then backtracks among the buffered frames to include as speech all immediately preceding frames which also have energy greater than the threshold. That Is, after a period during which the Ercirnr n of parameters received have been identified as silent frames, all succeeding frames arse tentively identified as silent frames, until a super threshold energy voiced frame is found.At that point, the silence suppression system backtracks among frames immediately preceding this super threshold energy V 0 1 c e d frame u n t il a n b r 0 k e n string subthreshold energy frames at least to 0.4 seconds long is found. When such a 0.4 second interval of silence is found, backtracking ceases, and only those frames after the 0.4 seconds of silence and before the first voiced super threshold energy frame are identified as non silent frames. At the end of speech, when a voiced frame is detected having an energy below the threshold T, a waiting counter is started. If the waiting reaches an upper limit e.g. 0.4 seconds , without the energy again increasing above T, the utterance is considered to have stopped. The significance of the speech silence decision is that bits are not wasted on encoding silent frames, energy tracking is not distorted by the presence of silent frames as discussed above, and long utterances can be input from an untrained speakers, who are likely to leave very long silences between consecutive words in a sentence.

Description of the Preferred Embodiments The present invention provides a novel speech analysis synthesis system, which can be configured in a wide variety of embodiments. However, the presently preferred embodiment uses a VAX 11 780 computer, coupled with a DigitalSound Corporation Model. 200 A D and D A converter to provided high resolution high bit rate digitizing and to provide speech synthesis. Naturally, a conventional microphone and loudspeaker, with an analog amplifier such as a Digital SoundCorporation Model 240, are also used in conjunction with the system. However, the present invention contains novel teachings which are also particularly applicable to microcomputer based systems. That is the high resolution provided by the above digitizer is not necessary, and the computing power available on the VAX is also not necessary. In particular, it is expected that a highly attractive embodiment of the present invention will use a TI Professional Computer TM , using the built in low quality speaker and an attached microphone as discussed below. The system configuration of the presently preferred embodiment is shown schematically in Figure 5. That is, a raw voice input is received by microphone 10, amplified by microphone amplifier 12, and digitized by D A converter 14.The D A converter used in the presently preferred embodiment, as noted, is an expensive high resolution instrument, which provides 16 bits of resolution at a sample rate of 8kHz. The data received at this high sample rate will be transformed to provide speech parameters at a desired frame rate. In the pre.ently preferred embodiment the frame rate is 50 frames per second, but the frame period can easily range between 10 milliseconds and 30 milliseconds, or over an even wider range. In the presently preferred embodiment, linear predictive coding based analysis is used to encode the speech. That is, the successive samples at the original high bit rate, of, in this example, 8000 per second are used as inputs to derive a set of linear predictive coding parameters, for example 10 reflection coefficants kl klo plus pitch and energy, as described below. In practicing the present invention, the audible speech is first translated into a meaningful input for the system.For example, a microphone within range of the audible speech is connected to a microphone preamplifier and to an analog to digital converter. In the presently preferred embodiment, the input stream is sampled 8000 times per second, to an accuracy of 16 bits. The stream of input data is then arbitrarily divided up into successive frames, and, in the presently preferred embodiment, each frame is defined to include 160 samples. That is, the interval between frames is 20 msec, but the LPC parameters of each frame are calculated over a range of 240 samples 30 msec . In one embodiment, the sequence of samples in each speech input frame is first transformed into a set of inverse filter coefficients ak, as conventionally defined. See, e.g., Makhoul, Linear Prediction A Tutorial preview , proceedings of the IEEE, Volume 63, page 561 1975 , which is hereby incorporated by reference. That is, in the linear prediction model, the ak s are the predictor coefficients with which a signal Sk in a time series can be modeled as the sum of an input uk and a line ar combination of past values Sk,, in the series. That is EMI10.1 Each input frame contains a large number of sampling points, and the sampling points within any one input frame can themselves be considered as a time series.In one embodiment, the actual derivation of the filter coefficients ak for the sample frame is as follows First, the time series autocorrelation values Ri are computed asEMI11.1 where the summation is taken over the range of samples within the input frame. In this embodiment, 11 autocorrelation values are calculated R0 R10 . A recursive procedure is now used to derive the inverse filter coefficients as follows EMI11.2 These equations are solved recursively for i l, 2 , . . .. up to the model order p p 10 in this case . The last iteration gives the final ak values. The foregoing has described an embodiment usingDurbin s recursive procedure to calculate the ak s for the sample frame. However, the presently preferred embodiment uses a procedure due to Leroux Gueguen. In this procedure, the normalized error energy E i.e. the self residual energy of the input frame is produced as a direct byproduct of the algorithm. The Leroux Gueguen algorithm also produces the reflection coefficients also referred to as partial correlation coefficients ki. The reflection coefficients kr are very stable parameters, and are insensitive to coding errors quantization noise . The Leroux Gueguen procedure is set forth, for example, in IEEE Transactions on Acoustic Speech and SignalProcessing, page 257 June 1977 , which is hereby incorporated by reference. This algorithm is a recursive procedure, defined as follows EMI12.1 This algorithm computes the reflection coefficients ki using as intermediaries impulse response estimates ek rather then the filter coefficients ak. Linear predictive coding models generally are well known in the art, and can be found extensively discussed in such references as Rabiner and Schafer, Digital Processing ofSpeech Signals 1978 , Market and Gray, Linear PredictiveCoding of Speech 1976 , which are hereby incorporated by reference, and in many other widely available publications.It should be noted that the excitation coding transmitted need not be merely energy and pitch, but may also contain some additional information regarding a residual signal. For example, it would be possible to encode a bandwidth of the residual signal which was an integral multiple of the pitch, and approximately equal to 1000 Hz, as an excitation signal. Such a technique is extensively discussed in PatentApplication No. 484,720, filed April 13, 1983, which is hereby incorporated by reference. Many other well known variations of encoding the excitation information can also be used alternatively. Similarly, the LPC parameters can be encoded in various ways. For example, as is also well known in the art, there are numerous equivalent formulations of linear predictive coefficients.These can be expressed as the LPC filter coefficients ak, or as the reflection coefficients ki, or as the autocorrelations Ri, or as other parameter sets such as the impulse response estimates parameters E i which are provided by the LeRoux Guegen procedure. Moreover, the LPC model order is not necessarily 10, but can be 8, 12, 14, or other. Moreover, it should be noted that the present invention does not necessarily have to be used in combination with anLPC speech encoding model at all. That is, the present invention provides an energy normalization method which digitally modifies only the energy of each of a sequence of speech frames, with regard to only the energy and voicing of each of a sequence of speech frames. Thus, the present invention is applicable to energy normalization of the systems using any one of a great variety of speech encoding methods, including transform techniques, formant encoding techniques, etc. Thus, after the input samples have been converted to a sequence of speecll Lrames each having a data vecenc Inct.ihin l an energy value, the present invention operates on the energy value of the data vectors. In the presently preferred embodiment, the encoded parameters are the reflection coefficients kl kl0, the energy, and pitch. The pitch parameter includes the voicing decision, since an unvoiced frame is encoded as pitch zero. The novel operations in the system of the present invention begin at this point. That is, a sequence of encoded frames, each including an energy parameter and modeling parameters, is provided as the raw output of the speech analysis section.Note that, at this stage, the resolution of the energy parameter coding is much higher than it will be in the encoded information which is actually transmitted over the communications or storage channel 40. The way in which.the present invention performs energy normalization on successive frames, and suppresses coding of silent frames, may be seen with regard to the energy diagrams of Figures 1 4. These show examples of the energy values E i seen in successive frames i within a sequence of frames, as received as raw output in the speech analysis section. An adaptive parameter ENORM i is then generated, approximately as shown in Figure 1. That is, ENORM 0 is an initial choice for that parameter, e.g. ENORM 0 100.ENORM is subsequently updated, for each successive frame, as follows If E i is greater than ENORM i l , then ENORM i is set equal to alpha times E i alpha timesENORM i l Otherwise, ENORM i is set equal to beta times E i 1 beta times ENORM i l , where alpha is given a value close to 1 to provide a fast rising time constant preferably about 0.1 seconds , and Beta has given a value close to 0, to provide a slow falling time constant preferably in the neighborhood of 4 seconds . It should be noted that in the software attached as apendix A, which is hereby incorporated by reference, the parameter alpha is stated as alpha up , and the parameter beta is stated as alpha downt . Thus, the adapative parameter ENORM provides an envelope tracking measure, which tracks the peak energy of the sequence of frames I. This adaptive peak tracking parameter ENORM i is used to normalize the energy of the frames, but this not done directly. The energy of each frame I is normalized by dividing it by a look ahead normalized energy ENORM i , where ENORM i is defined to be equal to ENORM i d , where d represents a number of frames of delay which is typically chosen to be equivalent to F second but may be in the range of 0.1 to 2 seconds, or even have values outside this range .Thus, the energy E i of each frame is normalized by dividing by the normalized energy ENoRM i E i is set equal to E i ENORM i . This is accomplished by buffering a number of speech frames equal to the delay d, so that the value of ENORM for the last frame loaded into the buffer provides the value of ENORM for the oldest frame in the buffer, i.e. for the frame currently being taken out of the buffer. The introduction of this delay in the energy normalization means that the energy of inital low energy periods will be normalized with respect to the energy of immediately following high energy periods, so that the relative energy of initial consonants will not be distorted.That is, unvoiced frames of speech will typically have an energy value which is much lower than that of voiced frames of speech. Thus, in the word six the initial allophone s should be normalized with respect to the energy level of the vowel allophone i . If the allophone s is normalized with respect to its own energy, then it will be raised to an improperly high energy, and the initial consonant s will be greatly overempha izcf3. Since the falling time constant corresponding to the parameter beta is so long, energy normalization at the end of a word will not be distorted by the approximately zero energy value of the following frames of silence. In addition, when silence suppression is used, as is preferable, the silence suppression will prevent ENORM from falling very far in this situation. That is, for a final unvoiced consonant, the long time constant corresponding to beta will mean that the energy normalization value ENORM of the silent frames F second after the end of a word will be still be dominated by the voiced phonemes immediately preceding the final unvoiced consonant. Thus, the final unvoiced constant will be normalized with respect to preceeding voiced frames, and its energy also will not be unduly raised. Thus, the foregoing steps provide a normalized energyE i for each speech frame i. In the presently preferred embodiment, a further novel step is used to suppress silent periods. As shown in the diagram of Figure 5, silence detection is used to selectively prevent certain frames from being encoded. Those frames which are encoded are encoded with a normalized energy E i , together with the remaining speech parameters in the chosen model which in the presently preferred embodiment are the pitch P and the reflection coefficients ki kio Silence suppression is accomplished in a further novel aspect of the present .nvention, by carrying 2 envelope parameters ELOW and WEIGH.Both of these parameters are started from some initial value e.g. 100 and then are updated depending on tie energy E i of each frame i and on the voiced or unvoiced s atus of that frame. If the frame is unvoiced, then only the lower parameter ELO is updated as follows If E i is greater than ELOW, then ELOW is set equal to gamma times E i 1 gamma times ELOW otherwise, ELOW is set equal to delta times E i 1 delta times ELOW, where gamma corresponds to a slow rising time constant typically 1 second , and delta corresponds to a fast falling time constant typically 0.1 second . Thus, ELOW in effect tracks a lower envelope of the energy contour of EI. The parameters gamma and delta are referred to in the accompanying software as ALOWUP and ALOWDN. If the frame I is voiced, then only EHIGH is updated, as follows If E i is greater then EHIGH, the EHIGH is set equal to epsilon times E i 1 epsilon times EHIGH otherwise, EHIGH is set equal to zeta times E i 1 zeta times EHIGII, where epsilon corresponds to a fast rising time constant typically 0.1 seconds , and zeta corresponds to a fast falling time constant typically 1 second . Thus, EHIGH tracts an upper envelope of the energy contour. The parameters ELOW and EHIGH are shown in Figure 3. Note that the parameter EHIGH is not updated during the initial unvoiced series of frames, and the parameter ELOW is not disturbed during the following voiced series of frames. The 2 envelope parameters ELOW and EHIGH are then used to generate 2 threshold parameters TLOW and THIGH, defined as TLOW PL times ELOW THIGH PH times EHIGH, where PL and PH are scaling factors e.g. PL 5 and PH 0.2 . A threshold T is then set as the maximum of TLOW andTHIGH. Based on this threshold T, a decision is made whether a frame is nonsilent or silent, as follows If the current frame is a silent frame, all following frames will be tentatively assumed to be silent unless a voiced super threshold energy and therefore nonsilent frame is detected. The frames tentatively assumed to be silent will be stored in a buffer preferable containing at least one second of data , since they may be identified later as not silent. A speech frame is detected only when some frame is found which has a frame energy E i greater than the threshold T and which is voiced. That is, an unvoiced super threshold energy frame is not by itself enough to cause a decision that speech has begun.However, once a voiced high energy frame is found, the prior frames in the buffer are reexamined, and all immediately preceding unvoiced frames which have an energy greater than T are then identified as nonsilent frames. Thus, in the sample word six , the unvoiced super threshold energy frames in the constant s would not immediately trigger a decision that a speech signal had begun, but, when the voiced super threshold energy frames in the i are detected, the immediately preceding frames are reexaminedt and the frames corresponding to the s which have energy greater than T are then also designated as speech frames. If the current frame is a speech nonsilent frame, the end of the word i.e. the beginning of silent frames which need not be encoded is detected as follows. When a voiced frame is found which has its energy E i less than T, a waiting counter is started. If the waiting reaches an upper limit e.g. 0.4 seconds without the energy ever rising aboveT, then speech is determined to have stopped, and frames after the last frame which had energy E i greater than T are considered to be silent frames. These frames are therefore not encoded. It should be noted that the energy normalization and silence suppress ion features of the system of the present invention are both dependant in important ways on the voicing decision. It is preferable, although not strictly necessary, that the voicing decision be made by means of a dynamic programming procedure which makes pitch and voicing decisions simultaneously, using an interrelated distance measure. Such a system is presently preferred, and is described in greater detail in U.S. Patent Application No. 484, 718, filed April 13, 1983, which is hereby incorporated by reference TI 9623 . It should also be noted that this system tends to classify low energy frames as unvoiced. This is desirable. The actual encoding can now be performed with a minimum bit rate. In the presently preferred embodiment, 5 bits are used to encode the energy of each frame, 3 bits are used for each of the ten reflection coefficients, and 5 bits are used for the pitch. However, this bit rate can be further compressed by one of the many variations of delta coding, e.g. by fitting a polynomial to the sequence of parameter values across successive frames and then encoding merely the coefficients of that polynomial, by simple linear delta coding, or by any pf the various well known methods. In a further attractive contemplated embodiment of the invention, an analysis system as described above is combined with speech synthesis capability, to provide a voice mail station, or a station capable of generating user generated spoken reminder messages. This combination is easily accomplished with minimal required hardware addition. The encoded output of the analysis section, as described above, is connected to a data channel of some sort. This may be a wire to which an RS 232 UART chip is connected, or may be a telephone line accessed by a modem, or may be simply a local data buss which is also connected to a memory board or memory chips, or may of course be any of a tremendous variety of other data channels.Naturally, connection to any of these normal data channels is easily and conveniently made two way, so that data may be received from a communications channel or recalled from memory. Such data received from the channel will thus contain a plurality of speech parameters, including an energy value. In the presently preferred embodiment, where LPC speech modeling is used, the encoded data received from the data channel will contain LPC filter parameters for each speech frame, as well as some excitation information. In the presently preferred embodiment, the data vector for each speech frame contains 10 reflection coefficients as well as pitch and energy. The reflection coefficients configure a tense order lattice filter, and an excitation signal is generated from the excitation parameters and provided as input to this lattice filter.For example, where the excitation parameters are pitch and energy, a pulse, at intervals equal to the pitch period, is provided as the excitation function during voiced frames i.e. during frames when the encoded value of pitch is non zero , and pseudo random noise is provided as the excitation function when pitch has been encoded as equal to zero unvoiced frames . In eithex case, the energy parameter can be used to define the power provided in the excitation function. The output of the lattice filter provides the LPC modeled synthetic signal, which will typically be of good intelligible quality, although not absolutely transparent.This output is then digital to analog converted, and the analog output of the d a converter is provided to an audio amplifier, which drives a loudspeaker or headphones. In a further attractive alternative embodiment of the present invention, such a voice mail system is configured in a microcomputer based system. In this embodiment, at TexasInstruments Professional Computer TM with a speech board incorporated is used as a voice mail terminal. Additional information regarding this hardware configuration is provided in Appendix B attached hereto, which is hereby incorporated by reference. This configuration uses a 8088 based system, together with a special board having a TMS 320 numeric processure chip mounted thereon. The fast multiple provided by the TMS 320 is very convenient in performing signal processing functions. A pair of audio amplifiers for input and output is also provided on the speech board, as is an 8 bit mu law codec.The function of this embodiment is essentially identical to that of the VAX embodiment described above, except for a slight difference regarding the converters. The 8 bit codec performs mu law conversion, which is non linear but provides enhanced dynamic range. A lookup table is used to transform the 8 bit mu law output provided from the codec chip into a 13 bit linear output.Similarly, in a speech synthesis operation, the linear output of the lattice filter operation is pre converted, using the same lookup table, to an 8 bit word which will give an appropriate analog output signal from the codec. This microcomputer. embodiment also includes an internal speaker, and a microphone jack. A further preferred realization is the use of multiple micro computer based voice mail stations, as described above, to configure a microcomputer based voice mail system. In such a system, microcomputers are conventionally connected in aslocal area network, using one of the many conventional LAN protoacalls, or are connected using PBX tilids. Substantial background information regarding such embodiments is contained in Appendix C, which is hereby incorporated by reference. The only slightly distinctive feature of this voice mail system embodiment is that the transfer mechnizam used must be able to pass binary data, and not merely ASCII data.As between microcomputer stations which have the voice mail. analysis synthesis capablities discussed above, the voice mail operation is simply a straight forward file transfer, wherein a file representing encoded speech data is generated by an analysis operation at one station, is transferred as a file to another station, and then is converted to analog speech data by a synthesis operation at the second station. Thus, the crucial changes taught by the present invention are changes in the analysis portion of an analysis synthesis system, but these changes affect the system as a whole. That is, the system as a whole will achieve higher throughput of intelligible speech information per transmitted bit, better perceptual quality of synthesized sound at the synthesis section, and other system level advantages. In particular, microcomputer network voice mail systems perform better with minimized channel loading according to the present invention. Thus, the present invention provides the objects described above, of energy normalization and of silent suppression, as well as other objects, advantageously. As will be obvious to those skilled in the art, the present invention can be practiced with a wide variety of modifications and variations, and is not limited except as specified in the accompanying Claims.
