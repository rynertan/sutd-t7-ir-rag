# Improvements made in seamed tubular tyres for cycles.

## Abstract
The tubular tyres for cycles having the carcass seamed on the intrados, presents the stitching 6 protected by an outer band 5 which is extended axially from one extremity to the other of the surface which is in contact with the mounting rim. The band is jointed by overstitching, and the outer edge 10 of the overstitching is separated from the inner edge 20 in correspondence of a limited zone, in the proximity of the band end, by means of an anti adhesive plate 13 . The circumferential sides of the said plates, materialize two predetermined circumferential lines of fracture 11, 12 that allow for tearing the band along these lines for, in this way, baring the stitching and simultaneously safeguarding the band ends and the corresponding carcass zone.
