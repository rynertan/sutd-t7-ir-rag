# Water ring vacuum pump.

## Abstract
A water ring vacuum pump having a body 10 with end members 11, 12 , an impeller 20 in the body and having a shaft which extends through the end members and being journalled for rotation 24 therein. One end member has an inlet 46 and the other an outlet. A port plate 30 is located in each member and adjacent the ends of the blades 22 of the impeller whereby a manifold 32 is formed between each port plate and its adjacent end chamber, the port plates being moveable relative to their adjacent end members by screws 40 or the like passing through the end member, which screws abut the face of the port plate and can act to vary its location relative to the impeller 20 and locking means 39 passing through the end member and into threads in the port plate whereby the port plate can be moved away from the impeller, which locking means, when the impeller is correctly positioned, acts against the screws or the like which abut the port plate, thus serving to lock the port plate in position. The pump also provides a hollow impeller whereby there can be movement of air direct from the inlet end to the exhaust end through the hollow portion of the impeller.
