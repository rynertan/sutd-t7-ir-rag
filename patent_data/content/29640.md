# Improvements in or relating to fumigation apparatus.

## Abstract
Fumigation appts. comprises a gas tight cabinet having a sealable door. Heaters are provided and a fan for circulating a fumigant around the cabinet. Air can be passed through an inlet and outlet both of which can be closed from the cabinet. Both the inlet and outlet contain U shaped passageways to the bottom of which liquid can be supplied. The liquid level can be raised to cut off the two sides of the U from each other to close the passageway. The level can be lowered to open the passageway by communication of the two sides of the U. The appts. is partic. designed for the fumigation of hatching eggs using a formaldehyde fumigant. It may also be used however for the fumigation of small plants or seedlings using a nicotine fumigant. The fumigator is relatively cheap to construct and operate while being completely safe in operation as regards release of noxious fumes.

## Description
IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO FUMIGATION APPARATUS This invention relates to fumigation apparatus for fumigation of hatching eggs and any other matter which it is required to fumigate to kill surface bacteria such as plants. Fumigation of eggs with formaldehyde gas is necessary in order to kill bacteria which may be present on the surface of the eggs. This is best done as soon as possible after an egg has been laid. When an egg it laid, it is at the temperature of the body of the hen but rapidly cools. The egg shell is full of pores through which it is possible for bacteria to enter. If the egg is laid in a dirty nest box or on the floor litter of a poultry house bacteria will enter the shell through the pores while the egg is still warm before it has contracted slightly and the pores have closed up. When the egg is incubated, the pores open up again in the warm, humid environment of the incubator.The pores in the shell are necessary because they enable the developing embryo of the chick to take in oxygen and expel carbon dioxide. Formaldehyde gas will kill most germs and bacteria but it is vital that the gassing is done as quickly as possible after the egg has been laid in order to kill these germs and bacteria while they are still present on the surface of the egg shell or at worst have only just got under the surface of the shell.It has been the practice for many years to collect eggs from farms once or twice a day to fumigate the eggs at the hatchery. Sometimes eggs are held for up to seven days in a cold room and are fumigated in a large fumigation chamber either immediately before or at best twentyfour hours before placing them in an incubator. In many cases the fumigation is of very little use at this stage because the bacteria bave had plenty of time to get into the egg and the gas will not kill them. An incubator is then an ideal breeding ground for bacteria and they multiply rapidly with the egg which eventually results in the death of the developing embryo. When the eggs are gas sea they are placed in a fumigation chamber where the temperature is raised to about 90 F. and the relative humidity is about 85e. This tends to open the pores of the eggs and allows the gas to penetrate. If the eggs are fumigated at the farm, the chances are greater killing any bacteria present and therefore ensuring that the maximum number of embryos survive to become live chicks The world poultry industry has been aware of the need to fumigate eggs as early as possible but until recently the capital cost of installing a fumigation chamber at each farm has outweighed the advantages of early fumigation. The usual fumigation chamber at a commercial hatchery is of brick and cement construction with refrigeration type doors and, expensive ventilation, heating and humidification equipment. Depending on the capacity of the hatchery it can have up to twenty farms supplying it with hatching eggs.To build an efficient fumigation chamber on each farm would therefore be very costly. The fumigation chamber described below has been designed to do all of the tying that a large brick buIlt chamber will do but at a fraction of the capital cost and at a very low operating cost. Several such fumigation chambers for on farm gassing have been built before this invention but because of their design they have either failed, two fumigate all of the eggs properly or have leaked gas into the egg room or both. Formaldehyde gas can cause irritation to the skin, eyes and respiritory tract and has an unpleaseant smell Health and Safety Regulations in many countries make it impossible to operate egg fumigation chambers which may be a health hazard to the operators. The fumigation cabinet described has been so designed that it is completely safe to use while being extremely efficient in fumigation of hatching eggs Where other matters such as vegetable matter is to be fumigated, other fumigants may be used but it is invariably the case that such fwiigants are either noxious or have unpleasant side effects and so it is important to prevent release of such funigants to the environment in which the operator works The invention provides fumigation apparatus comprising, a gas tight cabinet to receive the matter to be fumigated, at least one sealable opening in the cabinet through which eggs to be fumigated can be placed in or removed fran the cabinet, means to heat the cabinet, means to circulate a fumigant in the cabinet, an exhaust outlet for fumigant fran the cabinet, an air inlet into the cabinet and means for closing both the inlet and outlet to the cabinet c1rising, in both the inlet and outlet, U shaned passageways and means to supply liquid to the bottan of each passageway and means to raise the level of liquid in the passageway to a level at which the two sides of the U are cut off from each otter to close the passageway and to lower the liquid level to a level in which the two sides of the U are in communication to open the passageway . The following is a description of same specific embodiments of the invention, reference being made to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is front perspective of a fumigation cabinet Figure 2 is a side view of the cabinet Figures 3 to 6 illustrate air inlet and exhaust outlet ducting arrangements for the cabinet Figure 7 illustrates a heater and thermometer tray assembly for the cabinet Figure 8 illustrates a moisture tank assembly for the cabinet Figure 9 illustrates a header tank for the cabinet and Figure 10 illustrates a trolley for supporting trays of hatching eggs for use with the cabinet. Referring now to Figures 1 and 2 of the drawings, there is shown a fumigation cabinet indicated generally at 10 which is in the form of an upright rectangular box haying front and rear doors 11 and 12 respectively, sides 13, a roof 14 and a base 15. The cabinet is built of a material known as farm board which is impervious to formaldehyde gas.Each door is made of plywood fastened to a. softwood frame and the inner surface of the door is clàd with galvanised steel sheet. The cabinet has a false ceiling 16 which is also made of farm board . The floor of the cabinet is made of steel plate of a thickness of three sixteenths of an inch or one eighth of an inch and is electro galvanised to prevent corrosion. The whole cabinet is sealed at all the joints with a mastic sealer as well as being nailed and glued when constructed. The framework on the outside is made of hardwood. The farm boardl panels which make up the sides, back, roof and false ceiling are fastened to the framework. Each door is hinged at one side to the framework and fastened at the other side with three handles 17. The handles 17 are of such design that they pull the door in towards the framework. The door is not recessed but is on the outside of the framework. A groove 18 is cut into the framework at each side of the door and at the top of the door. A neoprene rubber strip 19 is inserted and glued into this groove and stands proud of the framework by appr,oxbmately a quarter of an inch . Wh..en the door is closed, it is pressed against this strip, compressing it and thus forming an efficient seal at the sides and top of the door. The cabinet isof such dimensions that it is capable of housing a trolley which is laden with trays of eggs. When the trolley has been pushed into the cabinet, a length of angled steel 20 is fitted onto the steel floor at the entrance to the cabinet. This clips into three brackets 21 which are welded to the steel floor. The cabinet frame is recessed slightly to allow a length of angled steel which is slightly longer than the interior width of the cabinet to fit across the base of the cabinet. The door has a strip of neoprene rubber 22 fastened across its width about half an inch from the bottom of the door on the inner lining of the door.When the door is closed, this neoprene strip is compressed against the angled steel and therefore provides a gas tight seal. The provision of a door at the back as well as a door at.tSle he front allows a trolley full of eggs to be removed into a sterile room at the other side of the fumigation cabinet. The door is sealed in exactly the same manner as described previously. It is thought to be an improvement to have a second door and to position the cabinet in the egg room of a poultry house or farm egg store so that the room can be divided and the cabinet to be fitted into a dividing wall.Eggs are then placed into the cabinet through the front door, from the room which is considered to be the dirty area. When the gassing cycle has finished, the eggs are removed through the rear door into the clean area. By not removing the fumigated eggs via the front door there is less risk of the eggs being contaminated after fumigation by air borne bacteria.The cabinet can however be provided with a single door only. The false ceiling 16 of the cabinet has in it two holes of equal diameter. Into the left hand hole is fitted a fan and motor unit 25. This motor 23, 24 can turn in a clockwise or anti clockwise direction and thè impellor is do designed that itcan push air or pull air. The reason for this is described later. A trolley 26 for holding a supply of eggs to be fumigated is shown in Figure 10 and is constructed of square steel tubing and angled steel, which is hot dipped galvanised after construction.The trolley is mounted on two fixed and two swivel castors 27 or alternatively four swivel castors. The trolley is so designed as to be capable of holding plastic trays each 35 inches long by 12 inches wide by 2 inches high. The trays slide onto angled steel runners which are fastened within the framework of the trolley. Each plastic tray is capable of holding in ,indlvidnal pockets, 132 chicken eggs. A similar tray of the same dimensions is capable of holding in individual pockets, 100 turkey eggs or 100 duck eggs. Three types of trollies are available. Each trolley is designed to hold two stacks of trays and is therefore approstRately 28 inches wide by 37 inches long. A trolley holding two stacks of fifteen trays 3960 chicken eggs , two stacks of eighteen trays 4752 chicken eggs , two stacks of sixteen trays 3200 turkey or duck eggs is available. The cabinet is so constructed that it will accept all three trollies.The trollies are identical in length and breadth but vary in height. Between the roof of the cabinet and the false ceiling is a space which is divided into three separate chambers as can be seen in Figures 4 and 6. The centre chamber 28 is sealed in order that gas may not escape but is open to the interior of the cabinet by the two large diameter holes 23, 24, one of which has the fan 25 mounted over the hole. The outer chambers 29 contain the control panel 3Q at the front, and if it is a cabinet with front and rear doors, has a second electrical panel contained within the rear chamber. Mounted on the outside of the cabinet on the r ght hand side near the top is a stainless steel tank 31 containing a ball valve 32 and an immersion heating element 33 as shown in Figure 8. When the fumigation cabinet is gatrig through its gassing cycle, the immersion heater switches on automatically, heats the water and creates steam.. The steam enters the centre chamber 28, between the cabinet roof and the false ceiling, through a copper tube not shown . This tube is of half an inch diameter and is connected through the side of the stainless steel tank above the water level. It enters the centre chamber through a hole in the side of the cabinet and runs at a slight incline up into the centre chamber.The end of the tube which protrudes into the cabinet is capped and a series of small holes are drilled in the wall of the tube on the uppermost portion.Steam can escape through these small holes into the centre chamber. By having the tube running up an incline, any steam which condenses in the tube will not cause dripping onto the false ceiling. The water will flow back to the tank. The purpose of this steam vessel is twofold. It provides the necessary humidity within the fumigation cabinet and also assists with the heating of the cabinet. As the steam vessel is at head height for the average human, it is covered by a suitable guard to prevent anyone accidentally coming into contact with the hot metal of the vessel. Inside the cabinet there are recesses in both of the side walls into which are fitted mild steel cadmium plated trays 34 see Figure 7 . These recessed sections each contain an electric heating element 35, each being 650 watts. The elements are suitably guarded to prevent anyone from touching a hot element or being electrically shocked by touching a live terminal.The recesses are long enough to enable the air and gas which is being driven by the fan, to pick up the heat from the heating element without interrupting the air flow and causing currents of air to eddy . Into the top of one of the recesses is fitted an electrical contact thermometer 36. This thermometer is held in place by two spring clips through which a current of electricity can pass. When the desired temperature has been reached, the mercury in the thermometer completes the circuit by bridging the two clips, which are connected to electrical wires to a relay in the control panel. The action of the mercury making and breaking will cayse both heating elements to be switched on and off. This controls the heat in the fumigation cabinet to a certain accuracy. The thermometer is of the fixed contact type which is set at 850F., but this can be o,f whatever temperature is requested by a client.As long as the temperature of the eggs does not exceed 10off. for more than about 30 minutes, the temperature setting is not critical. The heaters are switched on and off according to the reading of the thermometer but is is possible for the heat to over ride this fixed temperature a little due to the heat givenoffby the steam tube. The gas is produced by one of two methods, according to the customers requirements. The usual method of releasing gas in large fumigation chambers is by adding a 40 formalin solution to crystals of potassium permanganate. The chemical reaction causes the liquid to heat rapidly to about 4500C. and gas is released.This method is used in the fumigation cabinet. Potassium permanganate crystals are placed in a stainless steel container 37. The container is placed into the left hand recess in the cabinet. A stainless steel tube leads from a funnel not shown on the outside of the cabinet to a point inside just above the container. The method is to place a measured amount of crystals into the container, to place the container in position in the left hand recess, to wheel in the trolley full of eggs to be fumigated, close and fasten the door. After pre heating the cabinet for ten minutes, during which time the steam vessel is in operation, the formalin solution is poured into the funnel and a stainless steel spring loaded cap is locked onto the top of the funnel to stop any escape of gas. The machine is then switched on to its automatic cycle. An alternative system is available, which avoids the mecessity of measuring out the correct amount of crystals of potassium permanganate and formalin solution for each fumigation operation. For the alternative system an aluminium vessel containing a heating element is fitted into the left hand recess in the inside of the cabinetInto this vessel a measured amount of crystals of paraformaldehyde are placed. After the eggs are put into the cabinet and the door is closed, the machine is switched on and the heating element in the aluminium vessel is automatically switched on. The heat causes the crystals to release formaldehyde gas. The element is controlled by a timer which switches it off after all the crystals have turned into gas. Although the cabinet is completely sealed, it must have an outlet through which to disperse the gas when the fumigation cycle is completed. It must also have an air inlet to admit fresh air to the cabinet in order to replace the gas and air mixture which is being expelled. The construction of the air inlet and exhaust outlet will now be described with reference to Figures 3 to 6. In tile roof of the cabinet are two oblong holes 38 only one of which can be seen in communication with the central chamber 28 above the false ceiling of the cabinet, the holes being positioned adjacent the large diameter holes 23, 24 in the false ceiling respectively. Mounted over these oblong holes on the ceiling are two stainless steel ducts 40, 41 which are oblong in shape and each duct has a lid which is fastened down and is made air tight by a neoprene rubber seal not shown around the top edge. The end wall of each duct remote from the aperture 42 in the base has an opening 43 formed with a peripheral flange 44 for connection to a further conduit. Mid way along each duct 40,41 there is a transversely extending open topped tank 45, 46 which extends across the full width of the tank and is supported on a wall 47 also extending across the full width of the tank.A baffle plate 48 extends downwardly from the top of each duct stopping short of the bottom of the duct to defineU shaped passages 45a, 46a through the tanks underneath the baffle plates. The tanks 45, 46 contain a liquid, preferably light oil, which can be raised above the lower edge of the baffle plate to close off the passageway between one side of the baffle and the other or lowered below the baffle plate to open the passageway from one side of the baffle to the other as illustrated in Figures 4 and 6 respectively. The two tanks 45,46 are connected together by a pipe 49 so that as the level of the liquid is raised or lowered, the levels will always be identical. In order to raise ahd lower the liquid level it is necessary to have a tank 50 to drain into or fill up from. Ihe third tank is a closed vessel 50 which has a filler hole 51 in the top with a screw cap 52 and has an air vent not s rown . It is situated forward of the other tanks and is hinged at 53 along the base at the rear so that it can either be upright or tilted forward by an actuator 54. It is connected to the other tanks by a flexible pipe 55 which has a junction with the pipe that connects the two main tanks. If this vessel is tilted forwards to an angle of 45 degrees, the greater portion of it is below the level of the main tanks and the liquid will draim from those tanks into this holding vessel. When moved into the upright position, the liquid will flow back into the main tanks and the liquid level will rise sufficiently to close off the gap between the surface of the liquid and the bottom of the baffle plates. This liquid resenroii is tilted forwards and backwards by an electrically propelled piston or actuator. The control panel 37 for the fumigation cabinet is situated in the front cavity between the false ceiling and the roof and has a facia panel which has various switches and pilot lamps to monitor the fumigation cycle. Apart from a mains switch, there are two fuses for the protection of the instrument circuit and heater circuit respectively. Each fuse has a small pilot lamp situated below the fuse. Should a fuse blow the pilot lamp will light. The mains switch also has a pilot lamp to indicate that the power is. switched on. There is a cycle button which must be depressed in order to start the fumigation cycle. There is a two way switch to put the machine on to preheat or cycle. Additionally there are several pilot lamps which indicate cycle ont, heaters , gassing , exhaust , cycle off and preheat . The trollies which go into the fumigation cabinet, have a divider 56 between tbe two columns of trays. This is made of galvanised sheet metal and is permanently fixed within the framework of the trolley.There is a flap made of rubber sheeting, fixed to the ceiling of the cabinet. when the trolley is in the cabinet, this flap is in line with the sheet metal divider in the trolley, It therefore, together with the metal divider, separates the left hand and right hand portions of the cabinet, with the exception of the space underneath the trolley frame to provide with the chamber at the top of the cabinet, a p2tl and Which the fumigant is circulated by tile fan 25 to act on the eggs on the trolley. The fumigation operation is as follaws Potassium permanganate crystals or Paraformaldehyde crystals are placed in the receptacle provided inside the cabinet.The type of crystals used depends on the type of fumigation cabinet, as has been previously described. The trolley laden with trays of eggs is then pushed into the cabinet. The piece of angled steel is placed in position on the floor of the cabinet in the doorway and the door is closed and fastened. The mains switch is put to the on position and the two way switch to the preheat position. This starts the.fan motor and energises the heaters and also the immersion heater in the steam vessel. The fan blows air downwards through the let hand column of trays, underneath th e trolley, upwards through the right hand column of trays, through the bole in the right hand portion of the false ceiling, across the chamber above the ceiling and back to the fan.The air is therefore being forced around the cabinet in an anticlockwise direction. On the way round, the air picks up warmth from the heaters and steam from the steam pipe. After a few minutes the cabinet should be sufficiently heated for the heater pilot lamp to go of, indicating that the desired temperature has been reached. The two way switch is now put to the cycle position and the cycle button depressed. Everything will now be done automatically. The heater in the fumigation vessel will now be energised and gas wili be released from the crystals of paraformaldehyde. If the machine is built for the other type of fumigant, then the formalin should be poured in through the funnel and the spring loaded cap replaced before pressing the cycle button. The fan will continue to drive the gas around the cabinet for a period of twenty minutes, during which time the heaters will work intermittently in order to keep the desired temperature and the steam vessel will operate continuously. After the twenty minutes gassing cycle, the fan will stop, the heaters Mill go off and the steam vessel wall cease operation. The gas is then allowed to remain static for a period of ten minutes. Following this, the fan motor starts again but this time in the opposite direction so that it is pulling instead of pushing the gas, The actuator on the top of the cabinet will move the holding vessel forwards and oil will flow into it from the main tanks. This will allow the gas to be forced out by the fan, which at tbe same time will draw in fresh air to replace the gas. Twerity minutes is the time allowed for the exhaust cycle. When this time has elapsed, the fan will stop and the actuator will move the holding vessel into the upright position in order to refill the main tanks with oil in readiness for the next fumigation cycle. The door can now be opened and the trolley full of eggs removed. During the fumigation cycle the pilot lamps on the facia of the control panel will indicate what is happening in the machine, i.e. gassing, heaters on, exhausting, cycle finished etc. On models which have a door at the rear, a monitor panel is fitted into the rear chamber between the ceiling and the roof and pilot lamps on the facia of this panel will indicate to the person who is to remove the eggs into the clean room, what is happening and when it is safe to open the rear door. Although the cabinet is absolutely gas tight, there may still be a smell of gas when the eggs are removed. This is due to gas which hasXentered through the pores of the eggs, escaping slowly into the air.However, the concentration is so low that it is completely safe and is not a health hazard. The smell of gas is less obvious from one trolley full of eggs after removal from a small fumigation chamber than it is from several trolley loads of eggs which have been removed from a large fumigation room in a commercial hatchery. The cabinet described above is intended particularly for the fumigation of hatching eggs using a formaldehyde fumigant. The cabinet is however equally applicable to fumigation of other material including vegetable matter and it will be understood that the fumigant used and the operating conditions including temperature and humidity are selected to suit the matter to be fumigated. For example the cabinet is particularly suitable for fumigation of small plants or seedlings for which a nicotine fumigant is used. Nicotine is supplied in liquid form to the fumigation vessel of the cabinet to produce the fumigating atmosphere. The internal temperature of the cabinet is maintained at a lower level than that used for fumigating eggs and the steam supply system for raising the humidity in the cabinet is not used. A trolley substantially the same as that used for carrying the eggs is used for supporting the plants seedlings except that the trolley is equipped with performated shelves to support the plants seedlings and allow the flow of fumigatory gas.to pass through the shelves and over the plants seedlings stored thereon.
