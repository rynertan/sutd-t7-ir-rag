## Description
A GAS INSULATED ELECTRIC BUS ASSEMBLY This invention relates to a gas insulated electric bus assembly which has a plurality of electric buses connected together in end to end relation. Many gas insulated compact electric substations have been established in recent years because of the increase in the demand for electrical power and the necessity of delivering electrical power into large cities. Gas insulated transmission lines, which are called gas insulated buses, are utilised in the manner of transmission lines connected to a substation. Such a gas insulated bus is constructed by sealing insulating gas, such as SF6, into a metal pipe holding a conductor therein which is supported in an insulating manner. The main considerations in the design of gas insulated buses are, therefore, concerned with achieving good insulating properties, providing easy on site installation of these buses and reduction of insulating gas leakage. Gas insulating buses can be laid irrespective of the ground configuration and in inclined regions.This is very useful in applying gas insulating buses to Un T substations constructed in mountainous areas. Figure 1 of the accompanying drawings shows a conventional gas insulating bus. Conductors 1 , inc are supported by means of solid insulating support members lob in metal pipes 2 , 2a , in which insulating gas la is sealed. The metal pipes 2 , 2a are butt welded together using an internal strap 3 and the conductors 1 , lc are connected by means of a connecting conductor 4 . The gas insulating bus is laid on the installation surface 5 . Figure 2 shows a cross sectional view of a gas insulating bus assembly which has one of the sections provided vertically or at an angle of inclination with respect to the other sections. The metal pipe 2 of one section is welded in end to end relation with a bent metal pipe 7 of the inclined section and the conductor 1 of the two sections are connected together by a plug in socket 6 . The welding of the metal pipes 2 , 7 is achieved on a horizontally arranged surface so as to provide easy welding. One of the problems with the arrangement ofFigures 1 and 2 is that considerable debris 8 , such as metal particles, enters into the pipes 2 , 7 during the welding operation of the metal pipes 2a , 2 and 2 , 7 , as shown in Figures 1 and 2. When an AC voltage is applied to the conductor 1 , the metal particles 8 repeatedly move inside the pipes 2 , as illustrated in the figures.The behaviour of the particles 8 in a horizontally disposed construction is shown in Figure 1. In the case of a bus assembly having a section inclined as shown in Figure 2, with the exception of some of the metal particles 8 that fall down the inclined section, most of the particles 8 remain in the horizontal section. In both arrangements, the repeated movement of metal particles and any other debris poses a threat to the insulating properties provided by the support members lb . An object of the present invention is to provide a gas insulated electric bus assembly which has improved insulating properties as compared with the prior art arrangements described above. According to the present invention, a gas insulated electric bus assembly comprises a first electric bus located at a higher level than a second electric bus and a third electric bus interconnecting the first and second bus, each bus including a metal outer pipe and the pipes being welded together in endto end relation, characterised in that the welded joint between the first and third pipes and the welded joint between the second and third pipes are so positioned that debris entering the pipes as the joints are formed passes to a region below the joint between the second and third pipes and a debris trap is located at this region. The third electric bus may be vertical or otherwise inclined at an angle to the first and second buses. The joint between adjacent metal pipes may be made by inserting the lower metal pipe into the upper metal pipe or by butt welding. In order that the invention may be more readily understood, it will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a cross sectional view of a prior art gas insulated bus arranged horizontally Figure 2 is a cross sectional view of a prior art gas insulated bus assembly having an inclined section Figure 3 is a cross sectional view of a gas insulated electric bus assembly according to the present invention and Figures 4 and 5 are enlarged cross sectional views of alternative forms of the joints between the pipes. An installation surface 11 has a first high level substantially horizontal surface lla , a second low level substantially horizontal surface llb and an inclined surface ill which is formed between the first and second surfaces. The surface ill can be a substantially vertical surface. Metal pipes 12 , 13 and 14 are arranged along the surface 11 including the inclined surface llc . These metal pipes 12 , 13 and 14 are jointed together in endto end relation and conductors 16 , 17 and 18 are supported in the pipes by means of insulating support members 15 . The pipes 12 , 13 and 14 are filled with insulating gas 19 , such as SF6, which is sealed inside them.A gas insulated electric bus assembly 20 is thus composed of a first high level bus section 21 and a second low level bus section 22 which are joined by an inclined third bus section 23 . As previously indicated, although bus section 23 is shown as inclined in Figure 3, it could be arranged vertically. One end of the first bus section 21 is bent downwardly with respect to the remainder of the pipe so as to coincide with the upper end of the section 23 , and one end of the second bus section 22 is bent upwardly for a certain length so as to coincide with the other end of the section 23 . The first and second bus sections 21 and 22 are connected to the third bus section 23 at joints 25 and 26 . Only the upper joint 25 will now be described in more detail because the joints 25 and 26 are practically of the same construction. The metal pipe 12 of the first bus 21 and the metal pipe 13 of the third bus 23 are butt welded together from the outside of the pipes but with a strap 27 placed against the inside of the joint 25 . The conductors 16 and 17 that are placed in the pipes 12 and 13 are joined together by inserting a plug 28b on conductor 16 into a plug in socket 28a on conductor 17 . The lower joint 26 is made in the same way. In the vicinity of the lower bus 22 below the joint 26 , and in the region where the bending takes place, there is provided a debris trap 30 in the form of a pocket opening into the interior of the metal pipe 14 . The debris trap 30 is placed on the underside of the bent region 29 , i.e. close to the second surface llb . The operation of the assembly of Figure 3 will now be described. Since the joints 25 and 26 are both located in the inclined section, any debris 31 , which would have an undesirable influence on the insulation and which could enter the pipes 12 , 13 and 14 during the above assembly and butt welding, is compelled to fall down to the bottom of the inclined pipe 13. This dust is then captured by the debris trap 30 . The effect of capturing debris is enhanced by applying vibration to the outside of the metal pipes 12 , 13 and 14 , or by temporarily applying a low voltage to the conductors 16 , 17 and 18 to make the metal particles move progressively downwards, as shown in Figure 3 by the dotted line, until they are captured in the debris trap 30 .As mentioned above, because the debris 31 is captured by the debris trap 30 , the harmful influence on the insulating characteristics due to accidental entry of the debris during the making of the joints is removed. The gas insulated bus assembly which is shown in Figure 3, for example, can be applied to a system having a transformer connected to the free end of bus 21 and a gas insulated switch connected to the free end of bus 22 . Figure 4 is a cross sectional view of a joint between adjacent pipes. An upper metal pipe 35a and a lower metal pipe 35b are connected at a joint 36 .The diameter of the end 36a of the upper metal pipe 35a is formed larger than that of the remaining part of the pipe. That is, the end 36a is expanded so that the adjacent end of the lower pipe 35b can be inserted in the end 36a of the upper pipe 35a with a certain margin of overlap. Thus, the end 36a of the metal pipe 35a fits over the end of the metal pipe 35a to cover it from above. The upper and lower pipes 35a and 35b are then joined together by welding the part 36b . The conductors 37a and 37b inside the pipes 35a and 35b are provided at their ends with plugs 28b so that they can be joined together by means of a connecting conductor 38 which has plug in sockets 28a at both ends. The conductors 37a and 37b are supported by insulating support members 15 .The entrance of metal debris, produced, for example, by sputtering at the weld part 36b , into the pipes 35a , 36b is reduced by the structure ofFigure 4 so that the resultant negative influence on the insulating properties is reduced. Figure 5 is a cross sectional view of another joint between two pipes. An end face of the upper pipe 35a faces an end face of the lower pipe 35b . A ring 40 projects slightly into the metal pipe 35a from the end face of the metal pipe 35b . The ring 40 is fixed on the inside surface of the lower metal pipe 35b so that the upper end of this ring forms a gap between itself and the inside surface of the metal pipe 35a . A pcking 41 is provided on the side of the ring facing the inside surface of the metal pipe 35a . The inside of the metal pipe 35a can, therefore, be sealed by the packing 41 of the ring 40 when the lower end of the upper metal pipe 35a and the upper end of the lower metal pipe 35b are brought together. The joint is then welded at the weld 42 . The internal conductors 37a and 37b are connected to each other in the same way, as shown in Figure 4. This method of jointing reduces the chance of metal debris entering into the pipes 35a and 35b . In the above description, the first and second buses 21 and 22 are arranged parallel to each other on parallel installation surfaces. However, there is no need for these first and second surfaces to be parallel they could be inclined to each other.Furthermore, although the case has been described where there is an inclined surface ill which links the first and second surfaces lla and ill , this inclined surface is not necessary. So long as the upper and lower buses are supported on the first and second surfaces, the inclined transition installation surface need not be physically present as a foundation.
