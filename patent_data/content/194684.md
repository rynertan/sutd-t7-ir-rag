# A composite membrane for use in gas separation.

## Abstract
There is disclosed a composite membrane comprising A a polysulfone type porous membrane capable of reject ing 90 or more of dextran molecules having a weight average molecular weight of 70,000 and B a specific styrene type resin coated on at least one side of the polysulfone type porous membrane in a thickness of 5 µm or less and in an amount of 1 x 10 ⁷ g cm² of the polysulfone type porous membrane, the styrene type resin being selected from the group consisting of I a specific styrene type linear polymer having a weight average molecular weight of 1 x 10 ⁵ or more, II a specific blend polymer prepared by blending at least two different styrene type linear polymers each as defined above and III a specific crosslinked polymer selected from the group consisting of i one prepared by a crosslinking a styrene type linear polymer having a weight average molecular weight of 1 x 10 ³ or more and ii one prepared by blending at least two different styrene type linear polymers each having a weight average molecular weight of 1 x 10³. Such a composite membrane has been found to be advantageously employed for gas separation because of its high gas permeability and high selective gas permeability.
