## Description
The present invention relates to rendering polysiloxane fluids resistant to depolymerization under the influence of substances which promote such depolymerization, in particular to clay induced degradation. Thiofunctional polysiloxane fluids as well as organopolysiloxane fluids may be prepared by reacting silanes or siloxanes in the presence of acid clays to form thiofunctional polysiloxane fluids and organopolysiloxane fluids. It is known that these siloxane fluids will degrade, especially at elevated temperatures, in the presence of acid clays to form volatile, lower molecular weight siloxanes and odor forming products. This often results in the loss of desirable functional groups and produces lower molecular weight siloxanes. When polysiloxane fluids, such as blends of thiofunctional polysiloxane fluids and organopolysiloxane fluids are used in an electrostatic copying apparatus to effect release between the toner treated paper which is impregnated with kaolin clay and a heated fuser roll, the siloxane fluids have a tendency to degrade and form low molecular weight siloxanes and odor producing products. It is believed that this is due to the kaolin clay which is present in the paper residue that collects in the sump along with the excess release agent. When the sump contents are reused, the combination of acidic kaolin clay and the high temperature of the fuser roll causes the siloxane fluids to degrade to form volatile, low molecular weight siloxanes having reduced functional groups. Condensation of the low molecular weight volatile siloxanes on electrical switches can inhibit the switches function due to the good dielectric properties of the siloxanes. Therefore, it is an object of this invention to provide stabilized polysiloxane fluids containing a thiofunctional polysiloxane fluid and or an organopolysiloxane fluid. Said polysiloxane fluids desirably are stable, against degradation e.g. in the presence of heat and kaolin clay without significantly affecting the properties of the siloxane fluids. The foregoing objects and others which will become apparent from the following description are accomplished in accordance with this invention, generally speaking, by the use of an aminofunctional compound for stabilizing a polysiloxane fluid containing a thiofunctional polysiloxane fluids and or an organopolysiloxane fluid against depolymerisation under the influence of substances which promote such depolymerisation, e.g. of kaolin clay, wherein the aminofunctional compound is used in an amount of at least 0.001 percent by weight based on the weight of the aminofunctional compound and the polysiloxane fluid, preferably at a temperature of from 20 C to 200 C.

Also, they may be prepared in accordance with the process described in U.S. Patent No. 3,598,853 to Friedman et al, in which an aminofunctional silane is condensed with a silanol terminated polydiorganosiloxane. Other methods for preparing aminofunctional siloxane fluids are described in U.S. Patents Nos. 3,890,269 to Martin 2,930,809 to Jex et al and 3,045,036 to Jex et al. Representative examples of aminofunctional siloxanes are The aminofunctional organopolysiloxane copolymers may be prepared in accordance with the procedure described in U.S. Patent No. 3,544,498 to Holdstock et al, in which a mixture containing the silanol chain terminated polyorganosiloxane and an aminoalkoxyalkylsilane or aminoalkoxyalkenylsilane and if desired, an aminoalkylsilane are partially hydrolyzed and condensed by adding the necessary amount of water to provide the degree of hydrolysis and condensation desired. Generally, the amount of hydrolysis and condensation desired is that amount which will result in a copolymer having the desired viscosity and the desired alkoxy content. After the partial hydrolysis and condensation, the reaction mixture consists of the organopolysiloxane copolymer, free alcohol corresponding to the alkoxy group which is hydrolyzed from the silane by the water addition and water resulting from the condensation of the silanol groups. The water and alcohol are stripped from the reaction mixture at reduced pressure and at a temperature ranging from room temperature up to about 60 C and more preferably at a temperature up to about 40 C. The amount of aminofunctional compound which may be added to the polysiloxane fluid consisting of a thiofunctional polysiloxane fluid and or an organopolysiloxane fluid to prevent degradation in the presence of acid clays may range e.g. from 0.001 up to 10 percent by weight, preferably from 0.005 to 5 percent by weight and more preferably from 0.1 to 1 percent by weight based on the weight of the polysiloxane fluid s and the aminofunctional compound. It is preferred that the aminofunctional compound be added to the polysiloxane fluid s at a temperature of from 20 C to 40 C and then heated up to a temperature of 80 C and more preferably from 60 C to 80 C. However, it has been found that the polysiloxane fluid s consisting of thiofunctional polysiloxane and or organopolysiloxane fluids may be stabilized in the absence of heat by merely mixing the amine with the polysiloxane fluid s at temperatures as low as 20 C. The polysiloxane fluid s stabilized according to this invention are stable at elevated temperatures in the presence of acid clays. These polysiloxane fluid s may be used as fuser agents in an electrostatic copying apparatus where they contact clay impregnated paper without gelling even at elevated temperatures. Specific embodiments of this invention are further illustrated in the following examples in which all parts are by weight unless otherwise specified. The thiofunctional polysiloxane fluids used in the following examples are prepared in the following manner About 99.95 parts of a trimethylsiloxy endblocked dimethylpolysiloxane having a viscosity of 350 mPa.s at 25 C are mixed with 0.05 parts of 4,4 bis alpha methylbenzyl diphenylamine of the formula at a temperature of from 20 to 30 C. About five parts of the mixture are placed in two aluminum evaporating dishes. To one dish is added 0.1 part of kaolin clay available from R.T. Vanderbilt Co. , and then both dishes are placed in a 200 C forced air oven for 24 hours. The percent of weight loss is determined. The results are illustrated in Table I. The procedure of Example 1 is repeated, except that 99.5 parts of a trimethylsiloxy endblocked dimethylpolysiloxane fluid having a viscosity of 350 mPa.s at 25 C and 0.5 parts of the amine are used. The results are shown in Table I. The procedure of Example 1 is repeated, except that the amine is omitted. The results are shown in Table I.

The percent of volatiles obtained in the presence of kaolin clay is substantially reduced. The procedure of Example 13 is repeated, except that 0.5 parts of an aminofunctional polysiloxane fluid, whose preparation is described below, are substituted for the 4,4 bis alpha methylbenzyl diphenylamine. The volatiles developed as the result of heating the thiofunctional polysiloxane fluid in the presence of kaolin clay are substantially reduced. The aminofunctional polysiloxane fluid used in this example is prepared by heating a mixture containing about 265 parts of octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane, 2.2 parts of beta aminoethyl gamma aminopropyltrimethoxysilane and 0.03 parts of potassium hydroxide to a temperature of 145 C for three hours. After cooling the liquid product to room temperature, 0.03 ports of acetic acid are added to neutralize the catalyst. The product is filtered and a liquid product having a viscosity of about 40 mpa.s at 25 C is recovered. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance NMR analysis indicates that the ratio of beta aminoethyl gamma aminopropyl to OCH₃ to CH₃ ₂SiO groups is about 1 3 36. The procedure of Example 1 is repeated, except that varying amounts of 4,4 bis alpha methylbenzyl diphenylamine are mixed with a blend of siloxane fluids consisting of 10 parts by weight of the thiofunctional polysiloxane fluid prepared in A above and 90 parts by weight of a trimethylsiloxy endblocked dimethylpolysiloxane fluid having a viscosity of about 300 mPa.s at 25 C at a temperature of about 25 C.
