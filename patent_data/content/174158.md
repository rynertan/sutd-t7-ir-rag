# Charge injection device.

## Abstract
In charge injection apparatus comprising essentially a charge injector 1 and a fluid supply arrangement 2 for the charge injector, fluid to be charged is introduced into a mixing chamber 20 via a supply line 25 where it becomes mixed with a volatile fluid, such as a high vapor pressure hydrocarbon or a halogenated component supplied through line 28 . The resulting fluid mixture is introduced into the charge injector and, on emerging through the exit orifice 5 of the charge injector into ambient atmosphere, the volatile fluid volatilizes to form a blanket of gas of higher dielectric strength than that of the ambient atmosphere. In this way, resistance to dielectric breakdown is increased which en ables the charge injector to be operated at higher potentials than would be the case in the absence of the volatilized fluid, without dielectric breakdown occurring.
