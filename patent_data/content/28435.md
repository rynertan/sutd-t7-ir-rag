# Aircraft climb out guidance system.

## Abstract
An aircraft guidance system operable during both takeoff and go around maneuvers allows safe operation even under adverse wind shear conditions. Initially the system controls vertical speed to achieve an acceptable, minimum climb rate regardless of airspeed loss. Should excess thrust exist such that the acceptable minimum clibm rate is exceeded, increased vertical speed and airspeed are commanded. When the climb rate significantly exceeds the acceptable minimum, airspeed is controlled to a specified value. Should the aircraft ever approach the stick shaker condition, an override command limits aircraft angle of attack.
