# Improvements relating to image enhancement.

## Abstract
Scanning apparatus for generating signals representing colour components of successively scanned picture ele ments of an original coloured image comprises a light source 1 means 42,45 for causing relative movement between the original image 3 and a light beam generated by the light source 1 whereby successive picture elements of the original image are scanned. Means 13 for generating a sharp light beam for each color component of each element and an unsharp light beam for at least one color component of each element are provided. Common detection means 10 receives the sharp and unsharp light beams and provides corresponding output signals. Sequencing means such as a filter wheel 13 causes the sharp and unsharp beams sequentially to impinge on the detection means 10 .
