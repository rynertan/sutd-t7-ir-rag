# PROCESS FOR PRODUCING PERMANENT MAGNET ALLOY.

## Abstract
A process for producing a permanent magnet alloy of R₂Co₁₇ series among rare earth element R Cobalt Co intermetallic compounds. As to R₂Co₁₇ intermetallic com pounds having stoichiometric composition Sm₂Co₁₇, wherein R in R₂Co₁₇ is samarium Sm , has not as yet made available a coercive force in spite of the possibility of a high energy product due to its high saturation magne tization and high Curie temperature. Permanent magneti zation of such compound has therefore hardly been ac complished This invention enables the permanet magneti zation of R₂ Co, Fe, M ₁₇ wherein M represents one, two or more elements of Ti, Cr, Ni, Cu, Zr, Nb, Hf, Ta, and W by subjecting the sintered product thereof to artificial aging at 700 800 C for 0.5 200 hours in a magnetic field in the heat treatment step, thus increasing the coercive force.
