Projectile according to claim 1, c h a r a c t e r i z e d i n t h a t said thermal barrier 40 comprises a punching of Kapton inserted into said liner 26 from the lager end thereof. 4. Projectile according to claim 1 or one of the following claims, c h a r a c t e r i z e d b y a fuze 13 connected to the forward end of said projectile body 22 by means of threaded connection, and having a lead explosive 33 arranged to impell high velocity mass rearwardly to said booster pellet 32 .

## Description
PROJECTILE TECHNICAL FIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to a projectile according to the preamble of claim 1.Well known munitions rounds comprise a cartridge case, of an appropriate caliber for insertion into the breach of a gun having rifling lands and a projectile attached to the cartridge case and including a forward fuze and a rearward body bearing a rotating ring and containing a charge of high explosives surrounding a liner having a booster charge to be fired by a lead explosive in the fuze.It has been found that occasionally preignition of a high explosive charge occurs, while the projectile is still in the gun barrel. This is destructive of gun barrels and hazardous to personnel.It is therefore the object of the present invention to improve known projectiles in such a manner that preignition may not occur. This object is achieved by the characterizing features of claim 1. Further advantageous embodiments of the present invention may be taken from the subclaims. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention takes into account that at the moment of firing there is a possibility of hot propellant gasses from the cartridge case leaking between the fuze and body of the projectile to ignite the booster charge, and provides a thermal barrier be posi tioned in the retainer of the booster charge in such a way as to prevent such propellant gasses from reaching the booster, without disabling the more direct and power ful ignition effect of lead explosion by operation of the fuze. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING The single figure of the drawing is a somewhat schematic view in longitudinal section of a munition round of the type under discussion, ready to be fired from a gun. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT FIGURE 1 shows a munition round 10 in the barrel 11 of a gun. Round 10 comprises a cartridge case 12 and a projectile 13 interconnected by crimping at a connection 14. Cartridge case 12 includes a charge 19 of propellant and means 16 for firing the charge, which may include a primer 17 and a flash tub 20. Projectile 13 comprises a forward fuze 21 and a rearward body 22, interconnected by a threaded connection 23.Body 22 includes a rotating ring 24 and a charge of high explosives 25, which is consolidated around a liner 26 secured in body 22 by a threaded retainer 27.Liner 26 is of generally conical hollow configuration, and tapers outwardly from a rearward neck 30 to a forward rim 31 engaged by retainer 27. A booster charge 32 is consolidated in neck 30 and positioned to be detonated by impact of a high velocity mass impelled rearwardly by discharge of a lead explosive 33 centrally located at the rear of fuze 21. The function of ring 24 is to engage spiral lands in barrel 11, partly to cause projectile 13 to spin about its longitudinal axis as it leaves the barrel, and partly to minimize the passage of propellant gasses past the projectile to discharge uselessly at the muzzle of the gun, and upon firing of the piece hot gasses are present around the connection between fuze 21 and body 22. It has been discovered that on occasion hot gasses leak through the connection 23 into the center of retainer 22, and reach booster 32, igniting the booster which in turn ignites the high explosive, sometimes while the projectile is still in the gun barrel, to the damage of the gun and the possible injury of personnel at the gun. The invention here comprises a thermal barrier 40 positioned in neck 30 between booster 32 and retainer 27. Experience has shown that punchings of DuPont Kapton, so positioned, prevent any momentarily present hot gasses leaking past connection 23 from thermally contacting booster 32 to ignite it a sufficient thickness of Kapton to serve as a barrier of this sort has been found not to interfere with the impact on the booster of the high velocity mass from lead explosive 33, which can penetrate the barrier and reliably detonate the booster charge. It is convenient to punch the Kapton barriers sequentially from a roll of the material and concurrently introduce them into the liners, through the larger ends thereof, into contact with the boosters. In one successful embodiment of the invention the thermal barrier was made of one layer of Kapton 0,0762 mm thick, inserted into neck 30 in contact with booster 32. From the above it will be..evident that the invention comprises means for preventing preignition of the booster charge in high explosive projectiles, by interposing a thermal barrier between the charge and adventitous hot gasses entering the projectile between the fuze and the projectile body.
