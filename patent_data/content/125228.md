# Plasmids and modified strains of Vibrio cholerae, their preparation and derived vaccines.

## Abstract
Plasmids and modified strains of Vibrio cholerae are pre pared which are a genetically stable nontoxinogenic form of Vibrio cholerae which has a deletion mutation in both copies of the A₁ peptide encoding gene, resulting in the loss of a gene sequence required for expression of a toxic A₁ peptide. The modified strains are useful as live or dead oral vaccines.
