In a fuse holder for use in switchboards and conductor rail systems and comprising a socket part 10 having mounting means for mounting contact parts 13 and termi nal parts 15 , the socket part 10 is in each end provided with a vertically through going recess 33 and an longitudi nally extending screw or bolt hole 47 ending in the re cess. The recess 33 is on the rear side of the socket part 10 provided with a transverse partition 45 forming a clearance 44 for a nut part 41 , which together with a mounting screw 43 and a washer 53 allows fastening of the contact parts and the terminal parts to the socket part. This through going recess in each end of the socket part in creases the number of applications considerably, as there is now also a possibility of power supply and power dis charge on the rear side of the holder. The fuse holder is further provided with a cap 70 for covering a contact part. The cap 70 is constructed in such a manner that no contact can be established to live parts by means of a DIN standar dized test digit.
