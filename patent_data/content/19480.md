# Method and apparatus for measuring the temperature of hot gases.

## Abstract
The temperature of a hot gas 1 is measured by heat tubes 2, 3 the ends of which project into the gas, and which are maintained at a temperature considerably lower than that of the gas. The heat transferred from the gas to the heat tubes is conducted away, e.g. through rods 8 and 9 . From knowledge of the temperature of each heat tube and of the heat flow through the tube, the gas temperature can be computed. The use of the two heat tubes working at different temperatures enables the elimination from the computation of some uncertain parameters.
