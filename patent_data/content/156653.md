## Description
IMPROVEMENTS TO POLONAL STACKABtE DRUMS Field of the inventionThe present invention reiates to improvements to polygonal stackable drums. Background ArtSpanish Utility Model No. 241877 discloses a stackable, square drum whose base had holes to allow the passage of the prongs of fork lifts provided with beveled ends, in the jambs, and with a lintel in an inclined plane for displacing the centre of gravity towards the geometric centre of the load assembly, which enabled the usual load platforms or four elements pallets, to be dispensed with, and assisted the prongs of the fork lift to enter and leave the holes, avoiding the possibility of their unexpectedly getting snagged or dragged..Drums as described in, and contempory with, the abovementioned prior art had an upper lid in which the perimetral bourdon, or rim, remained under the supporting member of a second drum placed on top of a first, whereby the weight load was applied in part directly to the lid and created the risk of denting the lid. Furthermore the actual shape of the lid was such that in certain cases fitting drums into a stack was difficult.United States Patent Application Serial Number 134874 filed March 28, 1980 and it s continuation in part filed 12 July 1982, disclose a drum wherein the perimetral bourdon is raised and Ã…a channel for drainage is formed parallel to the perimeter and immeadiatly interior to the raised bourdon. Furthermore, the support points of the lower base of each drum were provided with a step so disposed that the weight of each drum passed directly through the vertical faces of the drum stacked below it.It has now been deeermiffied that further improvements may be made to drums whereby the operational lifetime may lengthened and the resistance of the drum to damage while in use may be increased.

The pcrimetral rim 3 is formed as an upward extension of the side wall surface 6. A square base portion 31 is provided at the bottom of the drum and forms both the floor 8 of the drum and each foot 9 to be received within the channel 30 of an identical drum when a plurality of such drums are stacked vertically on top of each other.The foot 9 is provided with an outwardly projecting step 10 to rest upon the perimetral rim 3 of an identical drum.The a side wall surface 6 is seamed to the the top 2 and the base portion 31 at locations 5 and 7 respectively, the nature of one possible variant on these seams being shown in figures 2 and 3 respectively. The side wall surface 6 has pressings 11 and 12 which act to strenghten the side wall surface and prevent collapse of an empty drum when a full drum is stacked above it. Thepressing 11 is a window like pressing while the pressing 12 comprises a substantially vertical rib which is provided in the side wall surface 6 to act as a strut.An orifice 4 for a closure member is provided in the top 2. Turning now to figure 4, there is shown a view of one foot of a drum according to the present invention seen from inside the drum. The pressed or rolled step 10 is seen from the inside together with the seam 7 between the side wall surface 6 and the base portion 31. In use the space within the foot 9 may be filled with a resin or other sealing compound to the level of the floor 8, to prevent residues accumulating when the drum is emptied.The pressings 12 acting as struts may be formed in pairsDisposed adjacent at least some of the vertical edges of the drum, with one rib of each pair disposed on each side of the respective vertical edge.Figures 6 and 7 show respectively, a view similar to that of figure 4, but with a draining hole 13 provided in the wall of the foot 9 and a section through one foot of a drum according to the present invention with details of a shoe 14 having a drain hole 17 in the sole thereof.In In f ig ur e 7, The shoe 14 substantially follows the contour of the foot 9. The drain hole 17, pierces both the shoe 14 and the foot 15, and is sealed by a drain plug 16. In embodiments such as this, the sealing of the feet as described above is of particular utillity. The sloping surface 15, which forms the inward facing surface of the drum slopes between the sole 32 of the foot and the floor 8 of the drum, as does the sloping surface of the shoe 14. This sloping surface 14 is particularly useful when the drum is being lifted by a fork lift, when the forks are centred from any off centre position as they impinge upon this surface.Figure 8 shows a detail of the upper rim 3 of a drum provided wit h an aperture 18 in the rim. The aperture is provided with an inner lining sleeve 19 extending through the aperture and flanged so as to retain the sleeve within the said aperture. This aperture may act as a fixing point for a handle or a slinging hook. By providing a series of apertures lined with sleeves in the manner described above it is possible that a plurality of laterally disposed drums may be secured together, or a single drum may be secured to a frame or support member by the use of a screw fixing, a drop pin or the like. Furthermore the aperture may provide the funtion of a drain hole to drain water from the channel without weakening the structure of the drum.An additional feature shown in figure 8 is the inward pressing 60 of the side wall surface 6, which in this instance bears upon the undersurface of the top 2 along line 61. By providing such an inward pressing it is possible to produce a structure by means of which a filled drum may be handled without deformation.Figure 9 shows a detail of the lower seam 7, i.e. the seam at the lower edge of the side wall 6. In this variant of the invention, a handle 20 is pressed into the side wall 6 above the seam. As an alternative or in addition, a similar handle may be provided as an inward pressing of the side wall beiow the upper seam 5.Figure 10 shows a section through a drum according to the present invention taken along a diagonal, with added ribs 21 provided to further strengthen the side wall surfaces 6. The added ribs are shown in a St. Andrewls Cross formation but other formations such as diagonal vertical or horizontal corrugations may be employed. As a yet further alternative, the St. Andrew 5 Cross formation may extend over at least one entire face of a polyhedral drum, in a manner with which the Jerry Can may be considered analogous.Figure 10 also shows a drop down handle 34 attached to the side wall surface by mountings fixedly attached to the surface.Figure tl, shows a section through one foot 9 of a drum according to the present invention with a variant of the shoe 22 attached by spot welding at points 23. It should be noted that this shoe does not follow the contour of the foot over its entire outer surface and thus forms an energy absorbing member, both to, give added mechanical protection to the drum in handling and to overcome the effects of evviromental shock or vibrations during storage and transportation. Figure 12, shows the upper part of a drum according to the present invention, provided with a lid 25, in the top 2. The lid 25 may be located centrally or offsetA dependent flange 24 forms a fixing point for a bag 27, which is held in place by a ring 28 provided with an over centre clasp means 29. The lid may be secured in place by a sealing ring 26 which may have deformable lugs to hold the lid in place, in the event of a shock. Figure 13 shows a modified shoe 40 attached to a foot 49 which has a rolled step 41. A further optional feature is shown in the figure wherein a D ring 48 is passed through the central void 42 of the rolling, thereby enabling the drum to be n.ore easily handled.Figure 14 shows a modified shoe 43 attached to a foot 50, provided with a corresponding aperture 44 to an inward pressing of the foot 48, whereby a slinging hook or the like not shown may enter the inward pressing of the foot and thereby enable the drum to be lifted. Figure 15 shows a modified foot 45, provided with a corresponding inward pressing 46 which substantially follows the contour of the. inward pressing 47 of the shoe 51, whereby a slinging hook or the like not shown may enter the inward pressing of the shoe and thereby enable the drum to be lifted. In either of the two cases outlined above, as illustrated in figures 14 and 15, the aperture adapted to receive the slinging hook or the like may be threaded, or otherwise provided with means to lock a carrying means in place. Furthermore, the floor 8 of the drum is provided with at least one inward pressing of which only one 57 is shown which acts aS a purchase for carrying and or handling of the drum. Figure 16 shows in profile a further variant on the present invention, wherein the foot 54 is adapted to fit within a shoe 53 provided with a pressed step 55. A cable or wire 56 is passed through a void between the foot 54 and the shoe 53, thereby enabling the drum to be more easily handled.
