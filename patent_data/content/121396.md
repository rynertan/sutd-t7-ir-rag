# ENERGY ABSORBING POLYURETHANE COMPOSITIONS

## Abstract
Energy absorbing polurethane elastomer composition having a density of from about 0.4 to about 1 gm cc, a com pression set of less than about 5 and a recovery time of from about 10 to about 1000 milliseconds containing a light weight filler are formed by reaction of a urethane forming compo nent comprising a compound containing at least four urethane forming reactive sites and capable of forming stable complexes through unsatisfied urethane forming reactive sites, an elasticising polyol selected from the group consisting of diols and triols, and a diisocyanate in less than stoichiometric amounts.
