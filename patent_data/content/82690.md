A plurality of responders, or separate ones thereof, can be identified at any one time up to the total number of data bits in use in a particular system of code used. 23. A plurality of data bits of a code can be used to identify selected pluralities of responders, e.g. so as to indicate or identify individual pluralities of responders. It will be appreciated that said signal S2 can be adapted to contain information for affecting at least one mode of operation of at least one sensor means responsive to said responder. A base station or programmer can have at least one mode of operation responsive to at least one signal S2, different signals S2 being able to produce e.g. a change in mode of operation of said base station, for instance to reject a code contained by a signal S2, and or modify a code in a signal S1 so as to reprogram at least one responder with another code.

In the accompanying drawings, which are given by way of example Fig. 1 shows schematic circuitry for one embodiment of a base station according to the present invention Fig. 2 shows schematic circuitry for one embodiment of a responder according to the present invention. The circuits of Figs. 1 and 2 are adapted to operate in accordance with the above mentioned preferred mathematical relationship 1 n n. f2 In Fig. 1, the base station is a transmitter receiver apparatus having a master oscillator 2 e.g.a crystal controlled oscillator resonating at a master frequency f that controls carrier continuous electromagnetic wave frequency transmitted by a transmitter system shown in box T1. The frequency f can have any value, subject to the frequency of the maximum clock rate of the responder Fig. 2 , and subject to any frequency restriction prescribed by a licensing authority. The frequency f passes from master oscillator 2 to one input of NAND gate 3. The other input of gate 3 is connected to programmable, mark space, monostable device 21 see later below in a logic system L1.Device 21 is programmable by data selector 32 so as to control the period s of time signals are switched on i.e. mark to the period s of time signals are switched off i.e. space , for signals to NAND gate 3 and flip flop 23 see later below . Device 21 call have any suitable oscillator means and gate means for providing that switching. The output of gate 3 passes the frequency f to transmitter system T1 and to programmable divider 4.An integrated circuit 22 within logic system L1 sets both divider 4 and a programme phase comparator 5 connected to the output of divider 4 which provides reference tiring data , so that the operating and capture ranges of comparator 5 are in accordance with the receiver system comprising detector 10 shown in box R1 and the bandwidth of aerial 1 of receiver system R1, such that only signals from the responder Fig. 2 compatible both in frequency and phase will be processed by base station . Data in the form of pulse position modulation i.e.PPM generated by comparator 5 from signals from detector 10 and divider 4 are fed from comparator 5 into a data sampling unit 23 in logic system L1 together with timing data from divider 4, and checked in sampling unit 23 for data content and errors in data frames before being passed to temporary holding registers 24, 25 in logic system L1. Each register 24 or 25 is a serial to parallel converter, whose register capacity is equal to the maximum code length to be stored by that register. The outputs of registers 24, 25 are fed to a magnitude comparator 26. The comparator 26 determines whether or not the totals in registers 24, 25 are greater than, less than, or equal to one another.If the total entered in register 24 equals that in register 25, then a data available flag can be set to provide a strobe pulse generated in monostable strobe generator 27, or utilised in any other way, e.g. request for interrupt processing of a multiprocess not shown . The strobe pulse is addressed to section A of integrated circuit 22 so as to indicate that data on lines lo to I7 only lines 10 and I7 are shown are valid during the duration of the strobe pulse. Transmitter T1 includes switch 40 for enabling master frequency f from gate 3 to go either to a first transmitter 41 or to one input of NAND gate 42. The second input of gate 42 is connected to an oscillator 43 having a higher resonance frequency than frequency f.Gate 42 enables a second transmitter 44 to transmit or not transmit frequency from oscillator 43. The lentil of code received by receiver system fi1 is controlled by a signal from the programmable, mark space, monostable device 21 present in logic system L1.The device 21 determines the period of transmission time from transmitter system T1. The device 21 enables access time for interrogation of the responder Fig. 2 to be tailored to meet the degree of acceptance in the environment of the responder, e.g. the number of data bits desired times frame width equals access time required, e.g. 48 x 4 ms 192 ms. Transmission from the base station can be switched off for e.g. a minimum of 10 ms to permit the responder Fig. 2 to reset counts etc. An output from the device 21 is coupled to an input of gate 3, and enables an input of flip flop unit 28 whose two outputs Q, F pass via first inputs of the respective IjAT3D gates 29, 30 to registers 24, 25.Flip flop 28 requires two successive pulse inputs for providing one pulse output. The second inputs of gates 29, 30 are coupled together and connected to a monostable delay unit 31, which is connected to a line coupling programmable divider 4 and phase comparator 5, and also connected to sampling unit 23. The delay unit 31 enables input data to registers 24, 25 to settle before entering those registers. Operation of decoding provided by the base station can be expanded to sample groups of data via data selector 32 in logic system L1, and to decypher encrypted code. Thus, the decoding can expand the number of possible codes attainable by e.g. simple binary arithmetic. Integrated circuit 22 interfaces between circuitry shown in Fig. 1 and other circuitry not shown . Line J provides serial input addressed to section B of circuit 22. Line K provides serial output from circuit 22.Integrated circuit 22 provides a clock signal to Baud rate generator 33 that provides nother clock signal.The generator 33 is coupled to a line connecting oscillator 2 to gate 3. The integrated circuit 22 has two sections, Section A, Section B. The Section A of circuit 22 is coupled to eight output stages shown as 0o to 07 of data selector 32. Section B of circuit 22 has three outputs shown as Oo to 2 coupled to three inputs shown as ho to A2 of data selector 32 the three outputs are also coupled to corresponding inputs of device 21. Three further outputs shown as 03 to 05 of the circuit 22 are coupled to lines each respectively connected to inputs of divider 4 and comparator 5. In Fig. 2, the responder is a receiver transmitter having a receiver system shown in box R2 and a transmitter system shown in box T2. Receiver systemR2 contains a detector 51 for detecting carrier wave frequency f in the transmission from the base station.Receiver system R2 contains alternative optional tuned circuits a , b which can b energised by aerial 50 so as to provide signals for use in receiver system R2 A demodulator 52 which can include a Schmidt trigger circuit for providing acceptable logic levels of a demodulated signal reods to a signal of sufficient amplitude fro detector 51, so that demodulator 52 feeds an output signal into a release line D leading e.g. to programumabl e memory e iii a logic system shown in the box L2. The release line D can enable a signal from demodulator 52 to release i.e. unlock a counter 61, such that the carrier frequency f will enable the released counter 61 to count as long as that frequency is present.The portion of release line D which couples demodulator 52 and counter 61 is also connected to an input of data frame width control unit 62. The control unit 62 sets the nominal frame width i.e. the duration of two successive data bits of the data to be processed by the logic system L2. After a delay preset in control unit 62, an output of control unit 62 is fed to counter 61. Counter 61 has a plurality of outputs coupled to inputs of data multiplexer 63 so as to address binary encoded signals to those inputs. As counter 61 counts, Lis mulLiplexer 63 samples bits stored in programmable memory 60. Outputs from counter 61 and from multiplexer 63 are fed into the input of pulse position modulator 65, whose output is to modulate the transmitter system T2. A programming control system shown as a subdivided box P of logic system L2 is used to enable or disenable entry of data from reset line 4 into reprogrammable memory 60. A programme enable flip flop 70 has an output Q coupled to an input of AND gate 71, whose other input is coupled both to a clocking system shown in boxC which is part of the logic system L2, and to a register 72 having an output coupled to input D of flip flop 70. Clock signals S3 from the clocking system C cannot reach the corresponding input of memory 60 when the gate 71 is in a blocking mode. Clocking system C can receive a signal S4 via an aerial or other means, so as to enable signal S3 to be provided.The Q output of flip flop 70 can only be changed by preloading a count into register 72 from the clocking system C, and providing carrier frequency f is present to release line D. When line D is released by carrier frequency f, and after sufficient time has passed to enable flip flop 70 to be clocked via register 72, tlse clock systemC is modulated so that the output of register 72 is changed to enable change in input D of flip flop 70. When carrier frequency f has enabled sufficient clocking of flip flop 70, the outputs Q, 5 of flip flop 70 are inverted, the Q output then enabling the clocking systemC via AND gate 71 to coniniunicate with memory 60, and the 5 output causing AND gate 74 to prevent reset line D from affecting flip flop 70 via gate 74 coupled to flip flop 70 s input R. The mode of flip flop 70 remains unchanged until the next clocking period regardless of the state of reset line D. Counter 61 provides a clock signal to a line interconnecting pulse position modulator 65 and a divide by two flip flop 75 which delays clock output from the counter 61 . An output of flip flop 75 is coupled to an input of the flip flop 70. The programming clocking system C cannot reach memory 60 during the blocking mode of AND gate 71, whose other input is controlled by the Q output of flip flop 70. When the clocking systemC can affect memory 60, data will be shifted in serial form into the memory 60 from line D. Memory 60 has three address lines XYZ for enabling a maximum of eight signals to address programmable divider 76 for it to divide the carrier frequency by a said number n. Divider 76 has an input coupled to a line connected to output of detector 51, and is also coupled to an input of width control unit 62. The XYL lines are also coupled to an analogue one of eight multiplexer 77, so that at least one input of a possible eight inputs can be passed at any one time by multiplexer 77 to transmitter T2. The data lines X, Y,Z can enable output frequency and tuning of transmitterT2 to be determined. Output of divider 76 and output of modulator 65 are coupled to inputs of AND gate 78, whose output is coupled to transmitter T2. Irrespective of the code length transmitted by the transmitter system T2, the train of transmitted data can contain a start bit for synchronisation, and a bit for indicating a low level of charge of a battery supply not shown for operating the responder, thereby enabling precautionary action to be taken before the battery charge level has fallen to cause corruption or loss in the code. Voltage comparator 80 is coupled to an input of multiplexer 63, and can be utilised in said charge level indicating. In Fig. 1, optional lines c,D, 51 enable two outputs from magnitude comparator 26 to be utilised in any useful way. The flip flop 28 is shown with II 2 so as to indicate that flip flop 28 changes from one mode of operation to an opposite mode of operation, in order to enable data acquisition in register 24 or in register 25. The truth table of any said AND gate is Input A Input B Output C 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 The truth table of any said NAND gate is Input A Input B Output C 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 Clocking system C provides one example of a programming enable clock responsive to an incoming signal S4 that is a continuous electromagnetic wave of radio frequency and amplitude modulated with data.Clocking system C receives signal 54 via an optional aerial 100. Signal S4 could be received via some other means, e.g. permanent or temporary physical linkage with a programmer. A responder can be programmed at any suitable distance from sources of signals S1, S4, without physical linkage to those sources when those signals are suitable, e.g. suitable radio frequency signals.Clocking system C has an aerial tuning capacitor 101, a diode rectifier 102, a demodulation circuit formed by capacitor 103 and resistor 104, and a Schmitt trigger circuit 105 for providing acceptable logic levels of signal S3.
