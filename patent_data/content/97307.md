# THERMO CHEMICALLY CROSS LINKED POLY P METHYLSTYRENE AND PROCESS TO OBTAIN IT

## Abstract
According to the present invention there is provided a thermo chemically cross linked poly p methylstyrene hav ing a Vicat softening temperature of at least 99 C. This composition is prepared by incorporating a high tempera ture initiator in the monomeric p methylstyrene and polymerizing this, usually in the presence of a conventional polymerization initiator, to produce a cross linkable poly p methylstyrene , which is then cured at elevated tempera tures sufficient to activate the high temperature initiator and cross link the polymer.
