# A method for producing a semiconductor device.

## Abstract
A method for producing a semiconductor device com prising the steps of forming, in a well 2 having a first conductivity type p and selectively provided in a semicon ductor substrate 1 having a second conductivity type N , two first impurity diffusion regions 6s, 6d having the second conductivity type and in an exposed surface region of the substrate 1 , two second impurity diffusion regions 8s, 8d respectively forming, in the well 2 and the exposed surface region of the substrate 1 , a third impurity diffusion region by implanting impurity ion having a P type or N type into the semiconductor substrate 1 and forming an electric current channel 9 either between the two first impurity diffusion region or between the two second impurity diffu sion region, thereby forming various integrated circuits by changing wiring channel.
