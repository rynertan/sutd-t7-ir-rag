## Description
The present invention relates to an outer sole for a basketball or like shoe. The game of basketball, being primarily a running game, subjects its players to a rather high degree of wear and tear, especially to their legs, knees, ankles and feet. For example, an average guard in a professional basketball league could very easily run between 4 7 kilometers per game. Even though the running is not continuous and, in fact, is interrupted by many stops and turns, the sheer amount of shock introduced into the lower limbs of a basketball player is extremely large. Unfortunately, presently known basketball shoes have been designed, by and large, with very little attention being paid to shock absorption or little attention being paid to shock absorption or dissipation qualities. A basketball shoe which could reduce the amount of shock being fed back up through the foot, ankle, leg, knee and even back of a player is long overdue. Many basketball players, in addition to suffering from stress type fractures as a result of poor shock absorbing qualities of prior basketball shoes, also suffer from injuries relating to such shoes instability problems. Clearly, the wider the base of the shoe that contacts the floor, the more stable the particular shoe would be. However, present and previously known basketball shoes are manufactured with a slight side taper which results in a construction that is the antithesis of stability. Another problem with presently known designs is the sharp definition of the outer edge at the junction between the bottom of the sole and side of the sole. The sharp edge clearly defines a fulcrum which becomes unstable as soon as the centre of gravity of the wearer passes over same. It is clear that a basketball shoe which could increase stability by providing a larger base, and which could eliminate the sharp fulcrum which results in ankle twists and similar injuries would be highly desirable. Although my original, basic design of a cantilevered or kinetic running shoe, as set forth in my CA A 1 097 064 is today well known, no one has yet applied any of the shock dissipation features of my design to basketball or like shoes. Typical basketball shoe designs of which I am aware are exemplified by the following United States patents 1,962,526 1,988,784 and 2,071,431. My original kinetic lever or cantilevered outer sole design, set forth in CA A 1 097 064, features means for cushioning the foot and leg of a wearer against impact loads which comprises a plurality of resilient tread members disposed about the peripheral portions of the lower surface of the outer sole, so as to support the central portion of the lower surface in a cantilever fashion. The tread members are inclined downwardly and outwardly from the peripheral portion of the lower surface so as to form a longitudinally and laterally oriented concavity for the outer sole. Each of the tread members includes shock absorbing means for permitting same to be resiliently urged laterally outwardly with respect to the central portion of the lower surface of the outer sole upon impact with the ground. Although CA A 1 097 064 discloses a sole having tread members inclined downwardly and outwardly to form a concavity, each tread member being resiliently urged laterally outwardly upon impact with the ground, it is directed towards an athletic or running shoe having a solid mid sole and a solid heel wedge. The mid sole of this shoe is sufficiently soft to provide the desired low resistance to tread member flexure during running. However, such a running shoe sole is unsuitable for a basketball or like shoe in which much greater foot induced impacts occur than during running. An object of the present invention is to provide a lightweight sole having the advantages of my sole of CA 1 097 064 and which facilitates flexing of the foot at a metatarsal head portion and pivoting of the foot at the ball of the great toe. In accordance with the present invention an outer sole for a basketball or like shoe comprises an outer sole for a basketball or like shoe, which comprises a heel portion, an arch portion, a metatarsal head portion and a toe portion an outer surface having a central portion and a peripheral portion a plurality of resilient tread members formed in said heel portion and extending downwardly and outwardly about said peripheral portion of said heel portion so as to support said central portion in a cantilever fashion characterised in that groove means extend transversely along said outer surface across said metatarsal head portion for facilitating flexing of the foot thereat and pivot means is formed in said outer surface under the position of the ball of the great toe for facilitating pivoting of the foot thereat. An embodiment of the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Referring now to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals represent identical or corres ponding parts throughout the several views, and more particularly to Figures 1 and 2 thereof, a shoe sole or outer sole is indicated generally by reference numeral 10 and is particularly designed for use as the sole of a basketball shoe as will become more clear hereinafter. The outsole 10 may be made of any suitable material, such as rubber or synthetic plastics. An upper 12 constructed of leather or canvas may be attached by conventional means to outer sole 10. A fibrous board 15 Figure 3 may be positioned within outsole 10 as a means for facilitating attachment of upper 12 as is well known by a person of ordinary skill in the art. Outsole 10 includes an outer or bottom surface 13 and an inner or inside surface 17 Figures 4 and 5 . A side wall 19 extends upwardly from the peripheral portion of the inner surface 17 so as to define a cup like recess within which upper 12 is received Figure 3 . The outside of side wall 19 may be provided with an indent 21 to facilitate stitching of the upper 12 to the outsole 10. The bottom of the outsole includes, as seen in Figure 4, a relatively broad base portion 25 which is generally concave and is defined by a plurality of levers or tread members 14 40. More particularly, the tread members 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24 and 26 extend downwardly and outwardly from outer surface 13 generally from the peripheral portion at one side thereof, while an opposed set of tread members 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38 and 40 extend downwardly and outwardly in the opposite direction from the other side of the sole. The tread members on the left and right sides of the outer sole are preferably arranged in opposed, aligned pairs, such as tread members 16 and 30, so as to coact in a manner which will be explained in greater detail hereinafter. It may be appreciated from Figures 3 and 4 that each of the tread members, such as tread members 16 and 30, generally may be said to include a down wardly and outwardly inclined lower wall 42 and 44, respectively, as well as a downwardly and outwardly inclined upper wall 46 and 48. Reference numeral 52 refers to a relatively thin, downwardly and inwardly inclined lower portion of side wall 19. Portion 52 forms, with the tread upper walls, for example, upper wall 46 of tread member 16, an outwardly facing recess or groove 50 at the junction of each tread member with the side wall 19. It may be appreciated that the tread members extend a substantial distance beyond the junction of each tread member with side wall 19 so that, upon contacting the ground, the tread members will flex more readily upwardly as a result of the lack of resistance immediately above the upper tread walls. In the preferred embodiment, tread members 14 40 extend outwardly beyond the entire side wall 19. For satisfactory shock absorption, however, it is only necessary that the tread members extend at least beyond the junction thereof with wall portion 52, whereby the extended portion of the treads may flex upwardly into groove 50. Further, at least portion 52 of side wall 19 is sufficiently thin so as to be flexible, allowing portion 52 to flex or collapse upon impact of the sole with a surface. Consequently, upon flexing, tread members 14 40 will move generally into a space defined by a cavity 104, as will be described in greater detail hereinafter. As portion 52 collapses or flexes, it also serves as a stop surface to limit upward movement of tread members 14 40, as will also be explained in greater detail hereinafter. Although the illustrated shape of the tread members is somewhat rectangular in plan and triangular in section, it may be appreciated that any of a number of shapes and configurations are capable of performing the same shock absorbing and dissipating functions as herein set forth. The important qualities are that the tread members extend from outer surface 13 down wardly and outwardly from the peripheral portion of the outsole to form a transverse concavity such that the tread members compress and flex, spreading laterally outwardly upon foot induced ground impact to dissipate shock components away from the central portion of the sole, and hence the foot of the wearer. The lower walls, for example walls 42 and 44, of the tread members may also be provided with gripping recesses 54 or the like to increase frictional stability. It is also noted from Figures 1 and 2 that the heel portion 56 is provided with an upper wall 58 that defines a groove 60 at the junction with side wall 19 so that heel 56 can flex in much the same manner as the other tread members. Referring still to Figures 1 and 2, it may be appreciated that in the forefoot portion of the sole 10 there is formed a somewhat oval herringbone or similar tread surface 62 to provide surface friction. A plurality of ridges 66 extend transversely across that portion of the outer sole above which the meta tarsal heads of the foot are positioned. Ridges 66 form transverse grooves 64 therebetween to facilitate forefront flexing. Positioned generally under the head of the ball of the great toe is a pivot stud 70 preferably in the form of a concave cup about which are formed concentric part circular grooves 68 which are an extension of the grooves 64. This construction facilitates simultaneous flexing and pivoting of the foot. The inner construction of shoe sole 10 is not normally in view when the sole 10 is attached to the upper 12. As viewed in Figures 3 5, the inner con struction includes a centrally formed, relatively rigid pedestal structure indicated generally by reference numeral 100. The pedestal structure 100 is designed to cooperate with the outer tread members to produce the optimum shock absorbing action, as will be hereinafter described. The pedestal structure 100 comprises a plurality of substantially parallel transverse main walls 72 84 which extend substantially vertically upwardly from the inner surface 17. Each main wall preferably extends along the approximate transverse centerline of a respective opposed pair of tread members. For example, wall 74 is formed along the transverse center line of tread members 16 and 30, as may be appreciated from Figure 5. Supporting the ends of main wall 74, and acting as a transition structure to the outer tread members, are two pair of substantially triangularly shaped support members 92 and 94. A pair of side support walls 86 and 88 extend longitudinally of inner surface 17 and connect the respective ends of each of the transverse main walls 72 84. A central longitudinally arranged support wall 90 may also be provided to further stiffen and support the pedestal structure. Positioned midway between adjacent transition side support members 92 and 94 of the inner walls 72 84 are a pair of opposed, substantially rectangular auxiliary support members 96 and 98 whose height is substantially the same as that of the transverse main walls 72 84. An inwardly extending rib 102 serves as a ledge for fibrous board 15 Figure 3 and also defines therebelow cavity 104 which extends about the periphery of the inner surface 17. Other boundaries of cavity 104 include the pedestal structure 100, side wall 19 and inner surface 17. The presence of cavity 104 immediately above the tread members further reduces resistance to flexure thereof and allows the tread members to compress more fully and more rapidly. Since the distance that the tread members travel upon ground impact is important to the amount of shock that can be absorbed or dis sipated, cavity 104 is of extreme significance in permitting a greater distance of compression or move ment during flexure of, for example, tread member 16 before upper wall 46 thereof meets and is stopped by side wall portion 52. The relatively rigid central pedestal structure 100 forms a connecting bridge for the cantilevered tread members and permits same to be fully compressed while the foot is properly supported. In the foregoing ways, the shock absorption qualities of this shoe sole are greatly increased. It will be noted from Figures 1, 2 and 5 that the central inner structure tapers from the heel towards the toe to a position where it merges into a sub stantially planar forefoot inner surface. The inner construction therefore is compatibly designed with the outer construction wherein the tread members are pro vided only up to the transverse metatarsal arch. In the game of basketball, it is believed to be more important to cushion shock at the initial heel strike, while the forefoot of the shoe is designed for the other basketball foot movements of flexing and pivoting. The described embodiment also provides improved stability in that the base 25 is wider, generally by the degree of lateral extension of the tread members, than in a normal basketball shoe. Further, as the shoe tips to the left or right, the tread members tend to extend their edge formed fulcrum point by stretching, bending and compressing, thereby further increasing stability and preventing premature out of balance conditions and consequent ankle stress. Obviously, numerous modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings. It is therefore to be understood that, within the scope of the appended claims, the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described herein.
