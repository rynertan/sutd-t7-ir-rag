# Exhaust gas sensor.

## Abstract
An exhaust gas oxygen sensor adapted for installation in an exhaust conduit of an internal combustion engine, com prises a sensing element 46, 48 responsive to the partial pressure of oxygen in the exhaust gas having electrical leads 42, 44 extending therefrom. A ceramic insulator 16 sup ports the sensing element at one end and includes a pedestal 60 located adjacent passages 22, 24 in the insulator 16 through which the lead wires pass. The pedestal 60 passes the sensing element 46, 48 from the ends of the passages 22,24 thereby minimizing cold working of the lead wires dur ing assembly. This aids in preventing fracture of the wires dur ing their use in a feedback fuel control system employing the oxygen sensor.
