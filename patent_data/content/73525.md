# A method in the preparation of poly arylene sulfide .

## Abstract
A method for dehydrating pre polymerization mixtures in the preparation of poly arylene sulfide in which a reac tion mixture of a sulfur source and an organic amide are contacted at a first pressure within a range of 138 kPa to 414 kPa and an initial temperature in a range of 149 C to 204 C to form a complex of the reactants with the mixture subse quently subjected to a decrease in pressure while elevating the temperature to a second temperature at which, at the chosen pressure, essentially all water is removed from the mixture. Other compounds including bases, alkali metal carboxylates, alkali metal carbonates, lithium halides, and lithium borate can be present in the reaction mixture. Pre ferably the sulfur source is sodium sulfide and the organic amide is N methylpyrrolidone.
