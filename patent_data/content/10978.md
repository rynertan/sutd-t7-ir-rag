# Electrodes with manganese dioxide coatings and method for manufacturing them.

## Abstract
An electrode for use in electrochemical processes is made in the form of a valve metal substrate such as titanium mesh, which carries a semiconductive inter mediate coating consisting of tin and antimony oxides, advantageously laid down upon the valve metal substrate in a series of layers, and an electrocatalytically active top coating of an oxide of manganese, applied in a series of layers of one or more thermally decomposable manganese compounds or by the direct electrodeposition of manganese oxide, the coated or electroplated substrate subsequently being baked in an oxidizing atmosphere at a temperature in the range of 380 to 420 C so as to convert the one or more compounds or the electro deposited oxide to an electrocatalytically active form of an oxide of manganese.
