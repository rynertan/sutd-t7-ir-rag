# Combination loading sensor.

## Abstract
The performance and condition of a tool 101, workpiece 519 or machine tool is sensed during machining operations by securing a single or plural 2603 strain gages to the tool holder. To increase the sensitivity of the strain gages on stationary tool holders, the tool holders are contoured to provide loca tions 1702, 2602 of higher strain in which the strain gages are attached. A single or plural strain gages 1702, 2602 are positioned to sense the combined effect of different strains such as axial thrust and torque and are electrically connected to provide a single Wheatstone bridge output signature which may be monitored to detect a defective operation. In rotating tools, the single signature output greatly reduces the coupling equipment such as rotary transformers and also reduces the monitoring equipment. A unique arrangement of a single strain gage or alternatively a plurality of gages enables monitoring of both torque and thrust simultaneously. The output from the plurality of strain gages can be made additive to increase sensitivity and yet requires only a single bridge circuit. The design is flexible in that the gages may be arranged for optimization of the single bridge output for either torque or thrust.
