# An angling aid.

## Abstract
An angling aid consists of a ring 10 of rigid plastics, formed with a diametral bore 12 and a fishing line passage, 13 and a split pin 11 which is a resilient fit in the bore. In use the pin traps a loop on a sinker line 17 in the ring opening. The fishing line passes through the passage, 13 is tied to the head 15 of the split pin and continues on to the hook. If a sinker gets snared, it may be detached from the line simply by relaxing the line so that the fish may pull the pin out of its bore.

## Claims
CLAIMS 1. An angling aid for use while angling with a sinker Characterized bya body formed with a bore, a peg adapted to be resiliently retained in the bore, a line attachment head on the peg, and a line passage through the body along which the line may pass from the head at an acute angle to the long axis of the peg, so that a loop on an auxiliary line may be held captive on the peg by passing the peg into the bore with a fishing line extending from the head to a baited hook and from the head throuah the passage to a fishing rod. 2. The angling aid claimed in claim 1 including a recess intersecting the bore so that the loop may be held captive by passing the peg into the bore and through the loop positioned in the recess. 3. The aid claimed in claim 2 in which the body is an annul us with the opening surrounded by the annul us forming the recess. 4. The aid claimed in claim 3 in which the bore passes diametrally through one thickness of the annul us and at least ends in an opposed blind bore. 5. The aid claimed in any one of the above claims in which the peg is a split pin, 6. The aid claimed in claim 5 in which the split pin is made of stainless steel. 7. The aid claimed in any one of the above claims in which the body is made of a rigid plastics.

## Description
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONTHIS invention relates to an angling aid.When angling with the aid of a sinker it often happens that when a fish has been hooked, the sinker or the sinker line gets entangled with rocks, reeds or other obstructions. The angler not only has to fight the fish, but also the entanglement often resulting in the loss of the fish with the hook, part of a line and the sinker.An object of the invention is to provide a device by means of which the fisherman may cause the sinker to be detached from the line.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONAn angling aid for use while angling with a sinker comprises a body formed with a bore, a peg adapted to be resiliently retained in the bore, a line attachment head on the peg, and a line passage through the body along which the line may pass from the head at an acute angle to the long axis of the peg, so that a loop on an auxiliary line may be held captive on the peg by passing the peg into the bore with a fishing line extending from the head to a baited hook and from the head through the passage to a fishing rod.The loop may simply be engaged over the peg between the head and the body, but there is a risk that the sinker may inadvertently pull the peg out of the body. In the preferred form of the invention there is a recess intersecting the bore so that the loop may be held captive by passing the peg into the bore and through the loop positioned in the recess. In one form of the invention the body is an annul us with the opening surrounded by the annul us forming the recess. In this case the bore passes diametrally through one thickness of the annulus and at least ends in an opposed blind bore.The peg is conveniently a split pin made of stainless steel and the body is made of a rigid plastics.DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGSFigure 1 is an exploded view of the angling aid of the invention, andFigure 2 is a view showing the device in use.DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENTFigure 1 shows the basic elements of the angling aid of the invention.It comprises a ring 10 made of a suitable rigid plastics and a stainless steel split pin 11.The ring 10 is formed with a diametral bore 12 in which the split pin 11 is a resilient fit. Almost parallel to the bore 12 is a passage 13 through which a fishing line may pass. It will be seen that the continuation of the passage 13 intersects the continuation of the bore 12 at a. sharply acute angle.In use a fishing line 14 is passed through the passage 13 and tied to the head 15 of the split pin 11. The line 14 continues as the trace 16 for a hook, or a separate trace may be tied to the head 15. Next a loop is connected to or formed at the free end of a sinker line 17 of a sinker 18. The loop is held in the central opening of the ring 10 and the pin 11 inserted to snare the loop.Angling may now commence and be carried out in the usual way. If a fish is caught and the sinker 18 gets snared on an obstruction the angler has two choices a he may elect to pull the fish and sinker from the water or b he may elect to lose the sinker and attempt to pull in the fish.In the latter event he relaxes his pull on the line 14. As the fish tries to pull away, it dislodges the pin 11 from the ring 10 which frees the loop on the sinker line 17. The fish may now be brought in and the angling aid comprising the ring 10 and the pin 11 with it. However, the sinker 18 is now lost.The illustrated device may also be used for kite fishing. In this case the suspending line from the kite has a loop passing around the pin 11.
