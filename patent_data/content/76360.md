# SINGLE CRYSTAL NICKEL BASE SUPERALLOY, ARTICLE AND METHOD FOR MAKING

## Abstract
A nickel base superalloy, particularly adapted for use in gas turbine engine single crystal blades and vanes is provided with a specific composition and heat treated in a particular manner to exhibit an improved balance of critical high temperature mechanical properties and resistance to oxidation and hot corrosion significantly superior to present ly available alloys. In its broad form, the alloy composition comprises, by weight, 7 12 Cr, 1 5 Mo, 3 5 Ti, 3 5 Al, 5 15 Co, 3 12 W, up to 10 Re, 2 6 Ta, up to 2 Nb, up to 3 V, up to 2 Hf, the balance being essentially nickel and incidental impurities. Nickel base superalloy single crystal articles formed of the alloy are described, as is the method, including heat treatment, employed to make the article.
