# Flueric partial pressure sensor.

## Abstract
A flueric partial pressure sensor includes a flueric bridge having two bridge legs 12, 13 adapted for sensing a reference gas and sample gas mixture. A linear resistor 24, 23 and an orifice resistor 26,25 are incorporated in each of the bridge legs 12,13 which are conjoined to discharge from a single outlet. The resistors 24,23,26,25 are arranged to provide an asymmetric balance of the flow rates through the bridge legs 12,13 . The asymmetric balance is selected so that in operation a constant pressure output signal is gener ated for a chosen partial pressure of a constituent gas of the sample gas mixture in varying absolute pressure conditions such as changes in altitude. Respective pressure signal outlets 22, 21 connected one with each bridge leg 12, 13 at a position between the linear resistor 24, 23 and the orifice resistor 26, 25 , are used to effect control of a flueric laminar flow proportional amplifier 11 . Outputs from the flueric amplifier 11 may be used to regulate a fluid mixing valve 51 , or to effect switching of an indicator device 81 .
