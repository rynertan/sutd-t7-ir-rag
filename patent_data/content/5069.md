## Description
WASHING INSTALLATION FORMACHINED PARTS This invention relates to a washing installation for washing articles such as machined parts having internal ducts, said installation comprising a washing machine and a transfer device for transferring articles to be washed to the washing machine, said washing machine comprising a rotary article holder which is rotatable step wise from an article loading and unloading station and through a plurality of washing stations before returning to the loading and unloading station, a plurality of holding locations provided on said holder to hold a plurality of articles, a plurality of washing devices provided one at each of said holding locations for applying a washing medium to the article held at the location, and a plurality of latching devices provided one at each of said holding locations for holding a corresponding article at each location during rotation of the article holder through said washing stations. Washing machines are very well known in which the articles to be washed are transferred by a conveyor device or pushed by a system of push bars with eclipsable fingers. These machines have wheels placed on the bars and the articles pass from these bars to the wheel and are taken step by step by the wheels through washing stations until they have gone round completely and returned to the original positions. A variation in these known machines consists of placing washing boxes at each of the wheel stations, so that washing takes place the whole time the article moves from station to station, due to the gradual turning of the wheel. The articles are normally fixed within each of the wheel stations by means of a latch finger which is opened by the action of a spring and an eccentric. This latch finger is open in the loading and unloading station and closed in all the other stations. One of the main disadvantages of placing the articles on washing jets of the actual wheel, consists of the fact that the flow of liquid is continuous in all of the stations, including the loading and unloading stations. As a result of this , the force of the jets acts during the loading and unloading of articles, which is a very delicate moment and there is the risk that the jets may make the articles jump and not become properly held in position and or cause damage to the washing machine or the articles. A washing installation according to the invention is able to overcome the disadvantages of the known washing machines and achieves greater efficiency in forcing the washing liquid through the inner ducts of the article to be washed when the article is an internally ducted part such as a machined part . Accordingly, the present invention provides a washing installation for ashing articles such as machined parts having internal ducts, said installation comprising a washing machine and a transfer device for transferring articles to be washed to the washing machine and said washing machine comprising a rotary article holder which is rotatable stepwise from an article loading and unloading station and through a plurality of washing stations before returning to the loading and unloading stations, a plurality of holding locations provided on said holder to hold a plurality of articles, a plurality of washing devices provided one at each of said holding locations for applying a washing medium to the article held at the location, and a plurality of latching devices provided one at each of said holding locations for holding a corresponding article at each location during rotation of the article holder through said washing stations characterised in that each washing device is connected to a corresponding one of said latching devices so that an article, when held in the corresponding holding location, is also held against the washing device to be washed thereby. According to a preferred embodiment, there is provided a distribution device for distributing washing liquid to the washing devices and comprising a fixed casing through which is taken a drive shaft for said article holder, a supply pipe connected to said casing, and a distributor mounted on the drive shaft for rotation therewith and having ducts corresponding in number to the number of washing devices and communicable with the interior of the casing and leading to said washing devices. The invention will now be described in detail, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a perspective view of a washing installation according to the invention and comprising a washing machine formed by two rotary article holders, and a transfer device for transferring articles to the article holders Figures 2 and 3 are detailed views, in size elevation and in front eievation respectively, of a washing station of one of the article holders shown inFigure 1 and Figures 4 and 5 illustrate transverse and longitudinal cross sectional views respectively, of a distributor element for controlling the supply of washing liquid to the washing stations of the articleholders. Referring now to the drawings, there is shown a washing installation comprising a washing machine formed by two rotary article holders, and a transfer device for transferring articles, such as internally ducted machined parts, to the article holders. The transfer device is designated by reference numeral 1 and comprises fixed and movable longitudinal bars. An article can be supported on the fixed bars, and is then transferred by the movable bars to a loading and unloading station of each article holder. Each article holder takes the form of a rotary wheel 2 which is provided with a plurality of article holding locations, formed by housings 3, and which is rotatable step wise from the loading and unloading station and through a plurality of washing stations before return ing to the loading and unloading station at which a washed article may be transferred back to the transfer device 1. The loading and unloading station is provided, at any one time, by the outermost of the housings 3.As shown in Figures 2 and 3, an article 7 is held at the loading and unloading station. At all times, except for the instant of loading or unloading of the articles 7, a latching device provided at each housing 3 is operative to hold the article 7 in position and comprises a latch finger 8. Each housing 3 includes flanged holders 4 which cooperate with the latch finger 8 in order to hold the article 7 in position. At each housing 3, there is provided a washing device in the form of a washing box 5 having outlet nozzles 6 which direct washing liquid onto the article 7. As will be seen in Figures 2 and 3, the outlet nozzles 6 contact the surface of the article 7, and may be in registry with entrance holes to internal ducts formed in the article 7, when the latter is a machined part. Each latch finger 8 is pivotally mounted on the wheel 2 for movement between a closed, article holding position, as shown in Figures 2 and 3, and an open, release position not shown . When the latch finger 8 is in the release position, an article 7 may be loaded or unloaded from or to the transfer device 1. In order to provide improved washing efficiency, each washing box 5 is connected to a corresponding latch finger 8 for movement therewith. Thus, when the latch finger 8 moves to the closed position as shown, the washing box 5 applies a clamping force to the article 7 preferably via the nozzles 6 to push the article 7 against the flange holders 4, and a very powerful washing action can be applied to the surface of the article 7 and or to internal ducts of the article 7. As will now be described with reference toFigures 4 and 5, a washing liquid distribution arrangement is provided to supply washing liquid to the washing boxes when the latter are in positions other than the loading and unloading station. On the common shaft 9 of the two wheels 2 there is mounted a distributor device 10 which comprises a fixed housing through which the shaft 9 is taken. Washing liquid is supplied to the distributor device 10 via a supply pipe 11, which then passes to the washing boxes 5 via ducts 13, equal in number to the number of washing boxes 5, which lead from outlet passages provided in a distributor 12 which is rotatable with the shaft 9. In order to control the distribution of washing liquid to the washing boxes 5 as a function of the rotation of the wheels 2, an apertured control plate 14 is fixed in the device 10 and has apertures 15 which register intermittently with the ducts 13. Thereby, the outlet points of the washing liquid can be pre set. The arrangement of the control plate 14 is such that no washing liquid is supplied to a washing box 5 when the latter is at the loading and unloading station for the articles 7. When a washed article 7 is to be unloaded e.g.from the left hand wheel 2 of Figure 1, the latch finger 8 and the washing box 5 connected thereto is pivoted against spring action to a released position not shown , and the movable bars of the transfer device 1 then move upwardly, horizontally and then downwardly in order to transfer the washed article 7 from the unloading station onto the fixed bars of the transfer device 1 at a position intermediate the two wheels 2.Thereafter, the article may be transferred to undergo a washing sequence in the right hand wheel 2.
