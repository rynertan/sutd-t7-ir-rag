# Gate valve and seat therefor.

## Abstract
An expanding gate valve including a valve body 12 having a cavity 16 formed therein and an inlet 74 and out let 18 formed in the body, both of which intersect the cav ity. A counterbore 92, 50 is formed about the circumference of both the inlet and the outlet at their respective intersec tions with the cavity. An annular seat 72 having a rear sur face and a front seat surface is received within the inlet counterbore 92 . An annular seal 88 is formed on the front seat surface and a second annular seal 88 is disposed be tween the rear surface 76 and the valve body. The front an nular seal has an outer diameter D₂ greater than the rear annular seal diameter D₁ and an annular recess 84 is formed on the front seat surface on the radially inward side of the annular seal, whereby fluid pressure in said inlet port will tend to urge the valve seat more firmly into the inlet port regardless of the position of the gate 32 .
