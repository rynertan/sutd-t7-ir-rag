# TAPPING ATTACHMENT ADAPTED FOR NUMERICAL COMPUTER CONTROL

## Abstract
A tapping attachment particularly adapted for use with machines under numerical computer control. The attach ment embodies tension cushion for the spindle by way of a tension spring as well as compression cushion for the spindle. The compression cushion is provided by way of an adjustable spring member which is in a bore of the spindle and which has a helical spring formed in it. The tension spring is on the inside of the compression spring member. The attachment as a whole is of relatively short overall length, adapting it for use in an automated system wherein attachments are automatically inserted in the machine and interchanged. The attachment embodies a hard start feature provided by way of releasable securement which will release the spindle for movement in response to predetermined axial force, so that in the case of a dull tap the automated movement of the attachment under computer controll will be kept accurately programmed. In one form of the invention the releasable securement is between the spindle and the body of the attachment. In a second form of the invention the releasable securement is between the spindle and the compression spring member carried within the spindle.
