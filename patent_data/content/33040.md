## Description
Pad Wiping Material for the Wiping of Coated Wire or Strip and a Method of Fonning such Material This invention relates to the wiping of a metal coating applied to a wire or strip. The invention has particular, although not exclusive application to the wiping of a coating as wire or strip emerges from a bath of molten metal such as zinc, or some other suit able metal coating material. Up until this time, in the galvanising of wire or coating of wire, the wire or strip has been taken from the bath at a shallow angle to the horizontal and wiped with an asbestos pad or asbestos string. In one case of asbestos string, the asbestos string is wound around the wire and the wire passed through a slot between a pair of fingers, so that the string is wedged into the slot, thus wiping the surface of the wire or strip. In the case of pads, these have generally been formed by hand, by winding asbestos card into a pad or disc, the pad or disc then being placed in a suitable pad holder. It is an object of this invention to go someway towards providing an improved material for the wiping of coated wire or strip, and to at least provide the public and manufacturers with a useful choice. Other objects will become apparent from the following description. According to one aspect of this invention, there is provided a material for wiping coated wire or strip, said mat erial including a compressed, non combustible material. According to a further aspect of this invention, there is provided a wiping material for pad wiping of coated wire or strip, wherein said material includes a compressed alumino silicate fibre material. According to a further aspect of this invention, there is provided a material for pad wiping of coated wire or strip including compressing a non combustible material into a pad by an applied pressure in a range 7 to 20 tonnes per square inch. This invention will now be described by way of example only, and it should be appreciated that modifications and improvements may be made to the invention without departing from the scope or spirit thereof. It has been found in experimentation, that a compressed non combustible material has particular advantages in the wiping of wire or strip, which has been coated with a suitable coating such as zinc, or some other metal coating material during the processing of wire or strip In one form of the invention, the material forming the pad wiping material is an asbestos material which is impregnated with graphite. This is conveniently formed by rolling asbestos string in powdered graphite, thereafter compacting the impregnated string into a mass, for example by crumpling it into a ball, and thereafter compressing this within or by way of a suitable press, not shown of a known type, at a pressure in the range of about 7 to about 20 tonnes per square inch. In one form of the invention, the press consists of a piston moving within a tubular member or housing of a cross section corresponding substantially to that of the resulting pads. The applied pressure or pressure applied to the pads will vary depending upon the size of the wire to be wiped, and hench the ability of the pad to wrap around the wire on the other hand the ability of the pad to remain as an integral unit during wiping. When compacted impregnated asbestos string is used therefore, it will be appreciated that the compacting of the asbestos into a pad, causes the pad to remain as an integral unit during wiping. For large diameter wires, the pads are preferably softer that is to say compressed at a lower pressure than would be the case for pads suitable for small diameter wires. In use, it has been found that a lubricant, for example powdered graphite, is required at the beginning of a wiping operation, that is to say, when the wire or strip begins to pass through or past the pad. However, the graphite material will function as a lubric .ant for the passage of wire or strip through or by the pad or pads. The use of the impregnated asbestos is however, by way of example only,and it is envisaged that glass fibre impreg nated teflon, when suitably compressed would also have the same advantages. In a further form of the invention, a pad is formed of an alumino silicate fibre material. It has been found that by using an alumino silicate fibre material, which is compressed into a pad by an applied pressure in the range of about 7 to about 20 tonnes per square inch, there are a number of advantages. By way of example the advantages are 1. The use of alumino silicate fibre removes or at least reduces health hazards which might be present by using the asbestos material as described herein before by way of example. 2. It has been found during experimentation that the use of alumino silicate fibre material, as a pad wiping material, enables the pad wiping material to withstand temperatures generally higher than asbestos material. For example it has been found that alumino silicate fibre material can generally withstand high temperatures such as found during wiping operations of up to approximately 13000C. 3. The use of alumino silicate fibre material as a pad wiping material has generally been found to give a longer and high pad life than other wiping materials such as asbestos . 4. By using alumino silicate fibre material as a pad wiping material, it has been found that a more even wipe is obtained over the wire or strip, than is generally obtained by using other materials such as asbestos . 5. The use of alumino silicate fibre results in a tighter wipe about the wire or strip, and generally speaking results in a low coating thickness as compared with other materials. The use of alumino silicate fibre is there fore somewhat more economic than other materials. As stated hereinbefore the non combustible material, be it asbestos, teflon or alumino silicate fibre is compressed into a unit by pressure in the range of 7 to 20 tonnes per square inch, so as to result in a compressed pad or disc, which is able to be used for the wiping of coated wire or strip. It should therefore be appreciated that improvements or modifications to this invention may be made without departing from the scope thereof, as defined by the appended claims.
