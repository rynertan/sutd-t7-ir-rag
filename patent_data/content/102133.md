# METALLIZED ARTICLE COMPOSED OF POLYPHENYLENE ETHER RESIN, HIGH IMPACT POLYSTYRENE, ALUMINA AND, OPTIONALLY, A STYRENE BUTADIENE RADIAL TELEBLOCK COPOLYMER

## Abstract
The adhesion of metal deposited from a metal deposi tion bath on the surface of an article molded from a thermoplastic composition of a polyphenylene ether resin is considerably improved by including alumina in the substrate composition, as described. The resultant parts. in stressed and unstressed form, exhibit bond strengths of at least 0.7 Kg cm. initially and after aging for several days, and are much more likely to withstand conditions normally causing separation of the metal deposit from the substrate.
