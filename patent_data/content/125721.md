# Method of providing magnesium fluoride layers.

## Abstract
Magnesium fluoride layers are obtained by disproportio nation of fluorine containing organic magnesion compounds, notably magnesium trifluoroacetate, magnesium trif luoroacetylacetonate and magnesium hexafluoroacetyl ace tate. A solution of such a compound in an organic solvent is provided on the substrate by spinning or dipping at room temperature after which the layer is heated to 500 C. The solution may also be atomized and sprayed onto the substrate which is maintained at a temperature of 600 C. It is possible by means of this method to provide pure magnesium fluoride layers at a comparatively low tempera ture in air and without using film forming vehicles. The MgFâ‚‚ layers obtained according to said method are useful as anti reflective layers on display screens, on optical elements and as components in a multilayer packet, for example a dichroic mirror.
