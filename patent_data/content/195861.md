# Suspension bridge.

## Abstract
This invention relates to suspension bridges. A mod ular component for a suspension bridge structure com prises in combination an elongated member 10 having one end 11 thereof supported upon a base 20 and the other free end 12 thereof disposed upwardly of the base. An elongated boom like member 30 is disposed to be support ed upon one end 31 of the base angularly relative to the other elongated member whereby the free ends 12, 32 of the members respectively are spaced one from another in a first vertical plane. A first tie means 40 extends between the free ends of the members 10 and 12 and a second tie means 50 extends between the free end of the elongated member 10 and a first anchor point 51 spaced from the base 20 whereby an acute angle is formed between the second tie means and the elongated member 10 . A further mirror image modular component is formed based on a second base so that the first and second bases are positioned in selected spaced relation one to another. An elongated traffic deck structure 60 is disposed below and longitudinally of the elongated boom like members 30 and supported thereform via respective tie means 71 . A novel method of constructing a bridge is also dis closed.
