# Discoloration resistant spandex fiber.

## Abstract
Increased resistance to discoloration induced by smog or heat is imparted to a spandex fiber by incorporating within the fiber a phenolic antioxidant and a dialkyl phenyl phos phite in which at least half of the alkyl groups are branched at the alpha position and the phenyl groups are unsubstituted or monoalkyl substituted.
