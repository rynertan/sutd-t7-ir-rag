# Flame retardant polymer compositions.

## Abstract
Polyolefins, such as polyethylene and polypropylene, are rendered flame retardant by incorporating therein a combination of 1 a Diels Alder adduct of a chlorinated cyclopentadiene and a polyunsaturated cycloaliphatic compound and 2 a ring brominated aromatic compound.
