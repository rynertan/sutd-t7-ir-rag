# FULL ADDER CIRCUIT USING DIFFERENTIAL TRANSISTOR PAIRS

## Abstract
A high speed full adder circuit comprising a plurality of dif ferential transistor pairs and operating at multiple logic levels. This full adder can be made up of basic logic circuits, each hav ing differential transistor pairs, such as exclusive OR circuits, AND circuits and OR circuits. To reduce the chip size of the full adder, while ensuringing a high speed operation, transistors which may be used in common are replaced by a smaller num ber of transistors, thereby reducing the number of required transistors.
