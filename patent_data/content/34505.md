# PLASTICIZING SCREW

## Abstract
The invention relates to plasticizing screws for use in screw extruders A problem with known screws and extruders is that the quality and uniformity of the extrudate is poor, with implasticised material being encapsulated in the melt. The screw shown has a first flight 33, 37 which extends through a feed section 35 and a plasticizing section 40 , and a second flight 36 which extends through the plasticizing section. The flights define a feed channel 34 , a solids channel 39 and a melt channel 38 . The solids channel 39 has an initial depth greater than the depth of the feed channel 34 and receives any solid material from the feed channel. There after, the depth of the solids channel is reduced, and the diameters of the flights allow plasticized material to pass from the solids channel to the 39 melt channel 38 .
