# FLUID PRESSURE ASSISTED ROTARY SHAFT SEAL WITH LABYRINTH BUSHING AND REPLACEMENT SEAL SLEEVE CARTRIDGE

## Abstract
A replaceable wear sleeve cartridge 20 fixedly mounted to a housing bore 32 carries internally the fixed race of an anti friction bearing 14 and a static seal race 28 . The wear sleeve cartridge defines with a labyrinth preseal bushing 22 fixed to the shaft, the basic elements of a labyrinth preseal and additionally resiliently couples through a seal wedge 24 , a rotating seal race 26 whose end face is both fluid pressure and resiliently biased against the end face of the annular static seal race.
