# APPARATUS FOR SENSING THE DISTANCE BETWEEN AN OBJECT OF ELECTRICALLY CONDUCTIVE MATERIAL AND A REFERENCE POINT

## Abstract
An apparatus for sensing the distance between an object 3, 4 of electrically conductive material and a reference point has an electrode 12h, 12v , the tip of which constitutes the said reference point. The electrode is connected via a supply line 15h, 15v to a high voltage source 14 adapted to generate high voltage pulses to provide an arc 16h, 16v between said electrode tip and said object 3, 4 . The apparatus also has an air cored measuring coil 17h, 17v disposed around said supply line 15h, 15v for sensing the electric field about said supply line and transmitting to a measuring signal sensing circuit 18h 25h, 18v 25v a measuring signal proportional to said electric field. The measuring signal sensing circuit preferably comprises a comparator unit adapted to compare the measuring signal with a signal corresponding to a predetermined distance between the object 3, 4 and the electrode tip.
