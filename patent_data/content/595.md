## Description
LAUNDRY DETERGENT COMPOSITIONS This invention relates to laundry detergent compositions containing no or low levels of phosphate materials, which exhibit highly improved particulate soil removal capabilities.These detergent compositions provide surprisingly effective clay soil removal performance even in the absence of detergency builders. Nonionic surfactants are generally used in laundry detergent compositions for their ability to remove greasy and oily soils. Cationic surfactants have also been used in detergent compositions, primarily to provide adjunct fabric care benefits, and not for the purpose of cleaning. Certain cationic surfactants have been included in detergent compositions for the purpose of yielding a germicidal or sanitization benefit to washed surfaces see, for example, U.S. Patent 2,742,434, Kopp, issued April 17, 1956 U.S. Patent 3,539,520, Cantor et al, issued November 10, 1970 and U.S. Patent 3,965,026,Lancz, issued June 22, 1976. Other cationic surfactants, such as ditallowalkyldimethylammonium chloride, are included in detergent compositions for.tthe purpose of yielding a fabric softening benefit, as disclosed in U.S.Patent 3,607,763, Salmen et al, issued September 21, 1971 andU.S. Patent 3,644,203, Lamberti et al, issued February 22, 1972. Such components are also used to control static, as well as soften laundered fabrics as, for example, in U.S.Patent 3,951,879, Wixon, issued April 20, 1976 and U.S.Patent 3,959,157, Inamorato, issued May 25, 1976. All of the above patents being incorporated herein by reference.However, none of these patents indicate that by the careful selection and combination of certain nonionic and cationic surfactants, to achieve specific nonionic cationic surfactant ratios and reduced cationic monomer concentrations, outstanding removal of particulate soils may be obtained. The compositions of the present invention have outstanding cleaning capabilities. In laundry tests, these compositions, not containing any builder components, have been shown to remove clay soils at least as well, and in some cases dramatically better, than fully built conventional laundry detergent compositions. In addition, the compositions inhibit the transfer of dyes, soften and control static through the washing and drying operations.Further, by selecting the preferred cationic components defined in this application, the compositions additionally provide biodegradability and excellent removal of greasy and oily soils, while also providing, in a single detergent.product, particulate soil removal, fabric softening, static control and dye transfer inhibition benefits to the laundered fabrics. The cleaning performance, which is superior to that previously demonstrated, is the result of a heretofore unrecognized cleaning potential of certain selected cationic surfactants when used in the presence of certain selected nonionic surfactants under the conditions specified herein. It is an object of this invention to provide laundry detergent compositions which yield outstanding particulate soil removal, and which also provide fabric softening, static control and dye transfr inhibition benefits. It is another object of this invention to provide laundry detergent compositions, yielding excellent particulate soil removal, which may be used in a variety of physi cal forms, such as liguid, solid, paste, granular, powder, or in conjunction with a carrier such as a substrate. It is a further more specific object of this invention to provide specific detergent compositions which yield excellent particulate soil removal and which are biodegradable. It is a still further specific object of this invention to define specific novel cationic surfactants which are biodegradable and which yield excellent particulate and greasy and oily soil removal performance, as well as fabric softening and static control, in the cationic nonionic surfactant systems of the present invention. It is another specific object of this invention to provide amide containing cationic nonionic surfactantcontaining compositions which yield both excellent particulate soil removal and anti redeposition properties. It is yet another object of this invention to provide a process for laundering fabrics which yiclds especially good particulate soil removal, using cationic and nonioic surfactant containing aetergcnt con ositions. Disclosure of the Invention The present invention relates to laundry detergent compositions, containing from 0 to about 20 phosphate materials, which are especially beneficial for the removal of particulate soils from fabrics and in preventing their redeposition back onto the fabric surfaces, which comprise from about 5 to about 100 of a surfactant mixture consisting essentially of a a biodegradable nonionic surfactant having the formula R OC2H4 nOH wherein R is a primary or secondary alkyl chain of from about 8 to about 22 carbon atoms and n is an average of from about 2 to about 12, having an HLB of from about 5 to about 17 b a cationic surfactant having the formula RmRXYLZ wherein each R1 is an organic group containing a straight or branched alkyl or alkenyl group optionally substituted with up to three phenyl or hydroxy groups and optionally interrupted by up to four structures selected from the group consisting ofEMI4.1 R1 and mixtures thereof, each R1 containing from about 8 to 22 carbon atoms, and which may additionally contain up to about 12 ethylene oxide groups, m is a number from 1 to 3, eachR2 is an alkyl or hydroxyalkyl group containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms or a benzyl group with no more than one R2 in a molecule being benzyl, x is a number from O to 11, the remainder of any carbon atom positions being filled by hydrogens, Y is selected from the group consisting of ta EMI5.1 EMI5.2 wherein p is from 1 to 12,EMI5.3 wherein each p is from 1 to 12,EMI5.4 9 mixtures thereof L is 1 or 2, the Y groups being separated by a moiety selected from the group consisting of R1 and R2 analogs having from 1 to about 22 carbon atoms and two free carbon single bonds, when L is 2 Z is an anion in a number to give electrical neutrality, and said cationic surfactant being at least water dispersible in admixture with said nonionic surfactant and c a fatty amide surfactant said composition having a pH of at least about 6.5 in the aqueous laundry solution, the ratio of said nonionic to said cationic surfactant being in the range of from about 1 1 to about 100 1, and the ratio of the combined nonionic and cationic surfactants to said amide surfactant being in the range of from about 5 1 to about 50 1. The compositions of the present invention are formulated so as to have a pH of at least about 6.5 in the laundry solution at conventional usage concentrations in order to optimize cleaning performance preferably, they are alkaline in nature when placed in the laundry solution and have a pH of greater than about 7. At pH lower than about 6.5, the overall cleaning performance of the compositions tend to decrease. Particularly preferred compositions have a pH of greater than about 8 in the laundry solution, in order to improve the removal of body soil. The compositions may be formulated so as to be free of oily hydrocarbon materials, such as many dry cleaning solvents, mineral oil, paraffin oil and kerosene, because these materials which are themselves oily in nature load the washing liquor with excessive oily material, thereby diminishing the cleaning effectiveness of the compositions of the present invention. The compositions may also be formulated such that the cationic component is free of hydrazinium groups due to their relatively high toxicity level which makes them unsuitable for use in the compositions in this invention. The compositions of the present invention comprise, by weight, from about 5 to 100 , particularly from about 10 to about 95 , and most preferably from about 20 to about 90 of a mixture of the particularly defined nonionic and cationic surfactants in the ratio stated. It is preferred that the detergent compositions contain at least about 1 of the cationic component otherwise sufficient cationic surfactant may not be present in the wash solution to provide the desired cleaning and conditioning results.Further, preferred compositions do not contain more than about 10 of the cationic component, due to cost and commercial availability considerations.Nonionic Component The nonionic surfactants used in the compositions of the present invention are biodegradable and have the formula R OC2H4 nOH wherein R is a primary or secondary alkyl chain of from about 8 to about 22, preferably from about 10 to 18, carbon atoms and n is an average of from 2 to about 12, preferably from about 2 to about 9, most preferably from about 2 to about 7, and especially from about 4 to about 7.The nonionic surfactants included within the present invention include branched alcohol ethoxylates. The nonionics have an HLB hydrophilic lopophilic balance of from about 5 to about 17, preferably from about 6 to about 14.Especially useful particulate soil removal can be obtained with nonionic surfactants having HLBs of from about 10 to about 13.5. These nonionic surfactants are preferably combined with less soluble cationic materials such as those having 2 or 3 long alkyl chains . Where more soluble cationic materials are used, nonionic surfactants of lowerHLB may be equally as beneficial. HLB is defined in detail in Nonionic Surfactants, by M.J.

Other biodegradable nonionic surfactants well known in the detergency arts may be used, in combination with one or more of the nonionic surfactants falling within the definition of the nonionic surfactants required in the present invention, to form useful nonionic surfactant mixtures. Examples of such surfactants are listed inU.S. Patent 3,717,630, Booth, issued February 20, 1973, and U.S. Patent 3,332,880, Kessler et al, issued July 25, 1967, each of which is incorporated herein by reference.

The specific cationic component to be included in a given system depends to a large extent upon the particular nonionic component to be included in the system, and is selected such that it is at least water dispersible, or preferably water soluble, when mixed with said nonionic surfactant. The term water dispersible means that the cationic and nonionic surfactants, as well as the anions discussed hereinafter, remain dispersed throughout the laundry solution during the washing process.Mixtures of the above defined cationic materials may also be used in the compositions of the present invention. Small amounts of other cationic materials can be tolerated in such mixtures When used in combination with nonionic surfactants, within the specific ratios and the preferred reduced cationic monomer concentrations, defined hereinafter, these cationic components provide excellent soil removal charac teristics, confer static control and fabric softening benefits to the laundered fabrics, and inhibit the transfer of certain dyes among the laundered fabrics in the wash solution.

R4 is a C1 to C10 alkylene or alkenylene group. n is from 2 to 4, preferably 2 y is from 1 to 20, preferably from about 1 to 10, most preferably about 7 a may be O or 1, and t may be O or 1, but t must be 1 when a is 1 and m is from 1 to 5, preferably 2. z2 is selected from the group consisting of EMI22.2 zl is selected from the group consisting of EMI22.3 and wherein at least one of said Z1 and Z2 groups is selected from the group consisting of ester, reverse ester, amide and reverse amide. N is an anion which will make the compound at least water dispersible, and is selected from the group consisting of halides, methyl sulfate, and nitrate, particularly chlqride, bromide, iodide, sulfate, and methyl sulfate.Mixtures of the above structures can also be used. These surfactants, when used in the compositions of the present invention, yield excellent particulate soil, body soil, and grease and oil soil removal. In addition, the detergent compositions control static and soften the fabrics laundered therewith, and inhibit the transfer of certain dyes in the washing solution. Further, these novel cationic surfactants are environmentally desirable, since both their long chain alkyl fragments and their nitrogen fragments are biodegradable, in that they degrade to yield environmentally acceptable compounds. Where this type of biodegradable cationic surfactant is used, it is preferred that the detergent compositions have a pH of not greater than about 11, preferably less than about 10, in the laundry solution, in order to minimize hydrolysis of the cationic surfactant. Preferred embodiments of this type of cat ionic component are the esters in which R1 is a methyl group and z2 is an ester or reverse ester group, particular formulas of which are given below, in which t is O or 1 and Y is from 1 to 20. EMI24.1 The preferred derivatives, described above, may be prepared by the reaction of a long chain alkyl polyalkoxy preferably polyethoxy carboxylate, having an alkyl chain of desired length, with oxalyl chloride, to form the corresponding acid chloride. The acid chloride is then reacted with dimethylaminoethanol to form the appropriate amine ester, which is then quaternized with a methyl halide to form the desired choline ester compound. Another way of preparing these compounds is by the direct esterification of the appropriate long chain ethoxylated carboxylic acid together with 2 haloethanol or dimethyl aminoethanol, in the presence of heat and an acid catalyst. The reaction product formed is then quaternized with methylhalide or used to quaternize trimethylamino to form the desired choline ester compound. As a guide in formulating compositions which deliver excellent particulate soil removal, the reduced cationic monomer concentration may be used. Thus, the nonionic and cationic components, defined above, may be combined into a surfactant mixture which has a ratio corresponding to a reduced cationic monomer concentration CR of from about 0.005 to about 0.2, preferably from about 0.008 to about 0.15, particularly from about 0.01 to about 0.1. A CR value within this range will yeild a composition which exhibits optimum particulate soil removal performance. Where the nonionic and cationic components used are pure, the more narrow CR ranges are preferred. In a preferred method of preparing the compositions of the present invention, the nonionic and cationic surfactants are intimately and completely mixed together prior to the addition of any additional components to the mixture.This intimate premixing of the nonionic and cationic components enhances performance of the compositions. An approximation of the CR of a surfactant mixture is obtained by dividing the concentration of the cationic surfactant monomer in the laundry solution by the critical micelle concentration CMC of the surfactant. As used in this application, CMC s are determined at 1050F in water containing 7 grains gallon of mixed hardness, unless otherwise stated. For purposes of this application, CR is calculated according to the equations given below. The concept of reduced monomer concentration is derived from the discussion in Tamamushi and Tamaki,Proceedings of the Second International Congress of SurfaceActivity, III, 449, Academic Press, Inc 1957 and inClint, J. Chem. Soc. Far. Trans., I, 71, 1327 1975 , incorporated herein by reference, in the context of an ideal solution, and is based on the following quadratic equation equation 11 in Clint EMI26.1 wherein in the above and the following equations C total analytical surfactant concentration in the solution moles l. sum of the cationic and non ionic concentrations C1 C2 wherein 1 denotes cationic surfactant .

The above equation is solved for the nonionic monomer concentration by taking its positive root equation 12 inClint .EMI27.1 By modifying this equation based on the assumptions of a regular, rather than an ideal, solution, the CR range for optimum performance was derived from the following equation EMI27.2 For a given cleaning test for a nonionic cationic system, x was found by inserting the values known from the test i.e., c1 , c2 , alpha , C and ss into equation 1 and solving iteratively for x, such that the error in x is less than 0.001. This procedure was repeated for a large number of tests, over varying usage conditions. The x values obtained were then used to solve for the cationic monomer concentrations using the following equation cn2 l x f2c2 . 2 The CR value was then calculated using equation 3 . CR c2 c2 3 The CR values obtained cover a large numbef of combinations and ratios of various nonionic and cat ionic surfactants, at various concentrations and temperatures, which have been evaluated for their ability to clean greasy oily soils. The examination of the resulting data revealed that for a given system the optimum cleaining of greasy oily soils was found at a CR value of from about 0.002 to about 0.2. This range of CR i.e., 0.002 to 0.2 can then be used to determine the range of optimum nonionic cationic ratios for any given combination of nonionic surfactant and cationic surfactant, for the desired wash concentration within the overall wash concentration range of from 100 parts per million ppm to 10,000 ppm of surfactant.This calculation is carried out in the following manner, where , CR, cl, c2, M1 and M2 are known for a given nonionic cationic surfactant pair a for a given nonionic surfactant, cationic surfac tant, and for each end of the CR range, solve for x using the equation 2 l x ef CR byEMI28.1 tb stassr6 tb numerical iterative techniques to anEMI28.2 tb r tb in x of less than 0.001 Lb find the range of Y from the equation Y l x X x 1 Y3 1000 N1 N2 W using 100 ppm and 10,000 ppm as the boundary values for W, for each end of the CR range c the nonionic cationic ratio NCR range for optimum performance is then within the range obtained by substituting the boundary values for Y into the formula Y NCR 1 Y Put another way, steps b and c may be combined into a single equation which may be solved directly for the NCR.EMI29.1 The above procedure is relevant only to wash solution concentrations above the critical micelle concentration of the nonionic cationic mixture. For concentrations which are as high as about five times the critical micelle concentrations, CR is essentially independent of concentration.This means that for conventional laundry usage concentrations e.g., 100 ppm to P0,000 ppm, and especially from about 250 ppm to about 3,000 ppm , the CR of most commerical cationic noniogic surfactant mixtures wherein the cationic component has a CMC of less than about 100 ppm, measured at 105 F water containing 7 grain gallon of mixed calcium and magnesium hardness will be independent of the actual uFage concentration, so that using a concentration of about 1,000 ppm in the above calcuLation will be a satisfactory approximatta for tbe entire range As used herein, if a concentratL range is not specified, the 1,000 ppm CR is meant. In addition to these reduced cationic monomer criteria, the nonionic cationic surfactant mixture may also satisfy tilt specific cloud point requirements, riven below. In addition to outstanding particualte soil detergency, these preferred compositions will be optimized for the removal of greasy oily soils. Thus, in preferred compositions, the cloud points of the nonionic cationic mixture and in preferred embodiments the nonionic cationic mixture plus any electrolytes present in the composition falls between about 0 and about 95 0C, preferably. between about 10 and about 700C, more preferably between about 20 and about 700C, especially between about 30 and about 500C.For cold water detergency, the surfactant mixture should have a cloud point between about 0 and about 250C. The fact that a composition has a cloud point within these temperature ranges assures that the composition can be utilized order laundry temperature compositions to achieve outstandLbg removal of greasy oily soils. If a composition does not have a cloud point within the temperature range specified, it will not yield outstanding greasy oily soil cleaning within that temperature range. The compositions will exhibit their best grease oil removal performance when the temperature of the wash solution in which they are used falls within about 20 C, preferably within about 15 C, and most preferably within about 10 C, of the cloud point of the nonionic cationic surfactant mixture.Put another way, the laundry solution temperature range in which the preferred compositions deliver optimum grease oil removal lies between the cloud point temperature of the system in the absence of the cationic component, and about 30 C, preferably about 25 C, most preferably about 20 C, above that cloud point temperature. As used herein, the term cloud point means the temperature at which a graph which plots the light scattering intensity of the compositions versus wash solution temperature begins to sharply increase to its maximum value, under the following experimental conditions The light scattering intensity is measured us r l aModel VM 12397 Photogoniodiffusometer, manufactured bySociete Francaise d instruments de controle et d analyses,France the instrument being hereinafter referred to asSOFICA . The SOFICA sample cell and its lid are washed with hot acetone and allowed to dry. The surfactant mixture is made and put into solution with distilled water at a concentration of 1000 ppm. Approximately a 15 ml. sample of the solution is placed into the sample cell, using a syringe with a 0.2p nucleopore filter.The syringe needle passes through the sample cell lid, so that the cell interior is not exposed to atmospheric dust. The sample is kept in a variable temperature bath, and both the bath and the sample are subject to constant stirring. The bath temperature is heated using the SOFICA s heater and cooled by the addition of ice heating rate 1OC minute the temperature of the sample is determined by the temperature of the bath.The light scattering intensity of the sample is then determined at various temperatures, using a green filter and no polarizer in the SOFICA. Fatty Amide Component In the present invention the nonionic cationic surfactant mixture additionally contains from about 2 to about 25 , preferably from about 2 to about 16 , and most preferably from about 3 to about 10 of a fatty amide surfactant.The ratio of the total cationic and nonionic components to the amide component in the composition is in the range of from 5 1 to about 50 1, preferably from about 8 1 to 25 1. When these compositions are formulated in accordance with the ratio and the preferred reduced cationic monomer concentration limits given herein, they result in excellent particualte soil removal performance as well as improved soil anti redeposition characteristics., Amides useful in these preferred compositions include, but are not limited to, carboxylic acid amides, sulfonic acid amides, phosphonic acid amides, and boronic acid amides. Preferred amides include those having the formulae EMI32.1 wherein R1 is a C8 C20 alkyl, alkenyl, alkyl phenyl or alkyl benzyl group, preferably C1O Cl8 alkyl, and most preferably C11 alkyl and each R2 is hydrogen, or C1 C8 alkyl or hydroxyalkyl, preferably hydrogen.Specific examples of these compositions include a mixture of stearoyl choline bromide present in the washing solution at 120 parts per million , the condensation product of coconut alcohol with 5 moles of ethylene oxide present in the wash solution at about 357 parts per million , and a mid cut coconut alkyl ammonia amide R1 coconut alkyl and R2 is hydrogen present in the wash solution at about 50 parts per million and a mixture of stearoyl choline bromide 100 ppm the condensation product of coconut alcohol with S moles of ethylene oxide 357 ppm , and lauramide R1 C11 and R2 is hydrogen at 45 ppm . Additional ComponentsWhile the compositions of the present invention may contain additive materials conventionally used in detergent compositions, the amount of anion producing materials, and hence anions, which will make the particular cationic surfactant used in the compositions non water dispersible should be minimized. Whether a particular anion constitutes an interfering anion depends upon the physical and chemical properties such as structure and dissociation constant of the particular anions and cationic surfactants used in a given composition.It is preferred that anionic materials be co itained in amounts sufficiently small such that not more than about 10 molar percent, preferably not more than about 5 molar percent, of the cationic surfactant contained in the laundry solution, is conplexed by the anionic material. Such a complexing of the anionic material with thr cationic surfactant decreases the overall cleaning and fabric conditioning performance of the composition. Suitable anionic materials may be selected based on their strength of complexation with the cationic material included in the composition as indicated by their dissociation constant . Thus, when an anionic material has a dissociation constant of at least about 1x10 3 such as sodium toluene sulfonate , it may be contained in an amount up to about 10 , by weight, of the cationic surfactant where the anionic material has a dissociation constant of at least about 1x10 5, but less han about 1x10 3, it may be contained in an amount up to about 15 , by weight, of the cationic surfactant and where the anionic material has a dissociation constant of less than about 1x10 5, such as sodium C11.6 linear alkylbenzene sulfonate , it should be contained only in amounts up to about 10 , by weight, of the cationic surfactant. It is preferred, in order to minimize the effects of interfering anions, that the compositions of the present invention be substantially free of phosphate, polyphosphate, silicate, and polycarboxylate builder anions, carboxymethyl cellulose, and anionic surfactants particularly preferred are those which are substantially free of phosphate, polyphosphate, and carboxymethyl cellulose materials. The compositions of the present invention contain frcrn 0 to about 20 of phosphate materials and, even though they contain no or low levels of phosphate materials, exhibit an outstanding level of articulate soil removal.It is preferred that the compositions be substantially free of phosphate materials both for performance and environmental reasons. The compositions of the present invention may also contain additional ingredients generally found in laundry detergent compositions, consistent with the restrictions on interfering anions, stated above, at their conventional artcatablished levels. Very low levels i.c., from about 1 to about 15 of electrolytes, such as perbo ates, phosphates, polyphosphates, carbonates o sulfates, may have a bene fi al effest on cleaning perfermange. The compositions of the present invention may contain up to about 15 , preferably up to about 5 , and most preforably from about .1 to 2 , of a suds suppressor component. typical suds suppressors include lonq chain fatty acids, such as those described in U.S. Patent 2,954,347, issuedSeptember 27, 1960, St. John, and combinations of certain nonionics therewith, as disclosed in U.S. Patent 2,954,348, issued September 27, 1960, Schwoeppc, both disclosures being incorporated herein by eference. Other suds suppressor components useful in the compositions of the present invention include, but are not limited to, those described below. Preferred suds suppressing additives are described inU.S. Patent 3,933,672, issued January 20, 1976, Bartolotta et al., incorporated herein by reference, relative to a silicone suds controlling agent. The silicone material can be represented by alkylated polysiloxane materials such as si ica a rog ls and xeroZgels and hydrophobic silicas of various types. The silicone material call be described as a siloxanc having the formula EMI36.1 wherein x is from about 20 to about 2,000, and R andR are each alkyl or aryl groups, especially methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl and phenyl. The polydimethyl siloxanes R and R are mett yl having a molecular weight within the range of from about 200 to about 200,000, and higher, are all useful as suds controlling agents. Additional suitable silicone materials wherein the side chain groups R and R are alkyl, aryl, or mixed alkyl and aryl hydrocarbyl groups exchibit useful suds controlling properties.Examples of the like ingredients include diethyl , dipropyl , dibutyl , methyl ethyl , phenylmethyl polysiloxanes and the like. dditonal useful silicone suds controlling agents can be represented by a mixture of an alkylated siloxane, as referred to hereinbefore, and solid silica. Such mixtures are prepared by affixing the silicone to the surfaces of the solid silica. A preferred silicone suds controlling agent is represented by a hydrophobic silanated most preferably trimethylsilanted silica having a particle size in the range from about 10 millimicrobs to 20 millinicrons and a specific srfce are above about 50 m2 gm. intimately admixed with dimethyl silicone fluid having a molecular weight in the range from about 500 to about 200,000 at a weight ratio of silicore to silanated silica of from about 19 1 to about 1 2. The silicone suds suppressing agent is advan tagcously rcleasably incorporated in a watcr soluhle or water dispersible, substantially non surface active det ergent impermeable carrier. Particularly useful suds supprcssors are the sclE cmulsifying silicone suds suppressors, such as DB 544, commercially available from Dow Corning, which contains a siloxane glycol copolymer together with solid silica and a siloxane resin. Plicrocrystalline waxes having a mclting point in the range from 350C 1150C and a saponification value of less than 100 represent addition examples of a preferred suds regulating component for use in the subject compositions, such waxes are described in U.S. Patent 4,056,481, Tate, issued November 1, 1977, incorporatcd herein by reference.The microcrystalline waxes are substantially water insoluble, but are water dispersible in the presence of organic sufactants. Preferred microcrystalline waxes have a melting point fron. about 65 C to 1000C, a molecular weight in tic range from 400 1,000 and a penctration value of at least 6, measured at 770F by ASTM D1321. Suitable examples of the above waxes include microcrystalline and oxidized micro crystalline petrolatum waxes Fischer Tropsch and oxidizedFisher Tropsch waxes ozokerite cercsin mown tan wax beeswax candelilla and carnauba wax. Alkyl phosphate esters represent an additional pref crred suds suppressant for use herein. These preferred phosphate esters are predeminantly monostearyl phosphate which, in addition thereto, can contain cli and tristearyl phosphates and monooleyl phosphates, which can contain diand trioleyl phosphates. The alkyl phosphate esters frequently contain some trialkyl phosphate. Accordingly, a preferred phosphate ester can contain, in addition to the monoalkyl ester, e.g., monostearyl phosphate, up to about 50 mole percent of dialkyl phosphate and up to about 5 mole percent of trialkyl phosphate. Other compatible adjunct components which may be included in the compositions of the present invention, in their conventional art established levels of use, include bleaching agents, bleach activators, soil suspending agents, corrosion inhibitors, dyes, fillers, optical brighteners, germicides, pH adjusting agents, enzymes, enzyme stabilizing agents, perfumes, fabric softening components, static control agents, and the like. However, because of the numerous and diverse performance advantages of the compositions of the present invention, many components, such as static control agents, fabric softening agents and germicides, will not usually be necessary. The compositions of the present invention may be manufactured and used in a variety of physical forms, such as solid, powder, granular, paste, or liquid. The compositions are particularly well suited for incorporation into substrate articles for use in the home laundering process. These articles consist of a water insoluble substrate which releasably incorporates an effective amount, preferably from about 3 to 120 grams, particularly from about 20 to 30 grams, of the detergent compositions of the present invention. A particularly preferred substrate article incorporates a bleaching component and a bleach activator on the substrate, together with the non ionic cationic surfactallt mixture ture. In a particularly preferred method of making the detergent compositions of tic present invention, the specif ically defined nonionic nic sur nts r in ly completely mixed at a temperature of from about 250C to about 95 C, preferably from about 400C to about 90 C, prior to the addition of any additional comporlents. Dy using this process, the components are taken from their original liquid or powder form and are made into a thick paste, which is ideally suited for use in the substrate articles, described above. when this process is used to make the compositions of the present invention, the components are present in non ionic cationic ratios of from 5 1 to about 1 1, preferably from 5 1 to about 5 3, and more preferably from about 10 3 to about 10 5, and are formed into mixtures which, satisfy the reduced cationic monomer concentration requirements, herein.In one p ,rticularly preferred embodiment of tis process, the components are intimately mixed together at a temperature of about .50C. Tn this embodiment, it is pre ferred that the anion contained in the cationic surfactant be bromide.Thus, when stearoyl choline bromide, a powder having the following formula,EMI39.1 is intimately mixed at a temperature of about 250C with the condensation product of 12 alcohol wi tli 5 moles of ethylene oxide, a liquid, at a nonionic cationic ratio of about 10 4, a thick paste product is formed Substantially simi ar results are obtained when the nonionic surfactant is the condensation product of coconut alcohol with 5 moles of ethylene oxide. In another particularly preferred embodiment of t iis process, the components are intimately mixed together at a tenperature of at least about 65 C. In this embodiment, it is preferred that the anion contained in tie cationic surfactant be chloride.Thus, when stearoyl choline chloride, a powder, is intimately mixed at a temperature of about 80 C with the condensation produce of C12 alcohol with 5 moles of ethylene oxide, a liquid, at a nonionic cationic ratio of about 10 4, a thick paste product is formed. If tie same components are mixed together at about 25 C, the mixture remains a liquid, which is much less desirable for use in raking substrate articles. Substantially similar results are obtained when the nonionic surfactant is the condensation protliict of coconut alcohol with 5 moles of ethylene oxide. The compositions of the present invention are used in the laundering process by forming an a ueous solution preferably one having a temperature of from about 10 to about 50 C containing from about O.Ol 100 parts p r million to 0.3 3,000 ppm , preferably from about 0.02 to 0.2 , most preferably from about 0.03 to about 0.15t, of tile nonionic cationic detergent mixture, and agitating tile soils fabrics in tliat solution. The fabrics are then rinsed and dried. When used in this manner, tlle compositions of tile present invention yield exceptionally good particulate soil removal performance.Further, the compositions also provide fabric softening, static control, and dye transfer inhibition benefits to the fabrics laundered therewith. Although not intending to be bound by theory, it is believed that tile clay removal mechanism is as follows. At the optimum nonionic cationic ratio, as defined by the reduced cationic monomer concentration, the cationic surfactant adsorbs onto ttle clay soil negatively charged in a mono layer, neutralizing the charge. This neutralized charge results in a hydrophobic surface which increases the adsorption of the nonionic surfactant onto the clay surface. The clay soil is then easily removed by the agitation. It has been found that when the nonionic cationic compositions of the present invention are used in a laundry solution, a threshhold concentration of at least about 50, preferably about 100, most preferably about 150, parts per nillion on tile cationic component must be present in the laundry solution in order to give the particulate soil removal benefit. Under conventional United States laundry conditions, which generally utilize fron about 150 to 1500 parts per million of a detergent composition in the laundry solution, nonionic surfactant to cationic surfactant ratios of frcm 5 1 to about 1 1 are necessary in order to provide this threshhold concentration in the laundry solution. All percentages, parts, and ratio used herein are by weight unless etherwise specified. Ihe following nonlimiting examples illustrate compositions and the method of the present invention.

The composition had outstanding clay soil removal performance and exhibited good anti redeposition properties. Substantially similar cleaning results are obtained where the detergent composition of the present invention does not contain the sodium chloride component, indicating that for the particular detergent composition defined above, sodium chloride does not contribute interfering anions to the laundry solution of the disclosed detergent compositions.

A mixture of the condensation product of C14 15 alcohol with 3 moles of ethylene oxide together with the condensation product of C14 15 alcohol with 7 moles of ethylene oxide in a ratio of lower etboxylate nonionic to higher ethoxylale nnnionic of about 2 1, or the mixture of the condensation product of coconut alcohol with 5 moles of ethylene oxide together with an alkyl glyceryl ether having the structural formula EMI45.1 in a ratio of alcohol ethoxylate to glyccryl ether of about 7 3. Results substantially equivalent to those obtained above are also obtained where the detergent composition has a ratio of nonionic surfactant to cationic surfactant of 1 1, 10 3, 5 3, 10 5,5 1, 8 1, 15 1 and 50 1. Substantially similar results are also obtained where the detergent composition is formulated, such as by the addition of monoethanolamine, to have a pH in the laundry solution of about 7, 8, 8.5, 9 or 10.

The detergent composition of the present invention, as formulated above, yields excellent particulate soil removal performance, good grease and oil removal, and gives fabric softening, static control and dye transfer inhibition benefits to fabrics laundered therewith. Substantially similar results are obtained where the nonionic component of the above composition is replaced by the condensation product of C10 alcohol with 3 moles of ethylene oxide, the condensation product of C12 alcohol with 5 moles of ethylene oxide HLB ll , the condensation product of coconut alcohol with 5 moles of ethylene oxide, the condensation product of coconut alcohol with 7 moles of ethylene oxide, the condensation product of C12 Cl3 alcohol with 6.5 moles of ethylene oxide, or the condensation product of C14 15 alcohol with 7 moles of ethylene oxide. Substantially similar results are also obtained when the ratio of nonionic surfactant to cationic surfactant used in the above composition is 10 3, 20 7, 10 5, 20 11, 5 3, 5 4, or 1 1. Similar results are also obtained where the cationic surfactant, used above, is replaced by one of the following surfactants EMI47.1 EXAMPLE III A control detergent composition was formulated by combining the condensation product of coconut alcohol with 5 moles of ethylene oxide together with the cationic surfactant having the formula EMI48.1 such that the ratio of nonionic surfactant to cationic surfactant was about 10 4. The detergent composition was used In the laundry solution at a concentration of about 500 ppm.A detergent composition of the present invention was formulated so as to contain the same nonionic and cationic components in the same ratio, but which additionally contained a C12 16 alkyl fatty acid ammonia amide, present in an amount such that the amide component would be present in the washing solution at a concentration of 50 ppm when the composition was used at a concentration of 500 ppm.This composition had a pH in the laundry solution of about 8.4. Nine swatches 3 cotton, 3 polyester, and 3 palyester cotton blend , were stained with a clay in wwatcr suspension and erc washed in a one gallon washing machine which simulates the action of a commercial washing machine, using each of the above two detergent composition .. Two 11 x 11 100 cotton terry cloths, with loop construction, were added to each washing machine as redeposition sites for tile soil removed from the stained swatches.The washing process was carried out for 10 minutes in water of about 1000F 38 C , containing 6.5 grains per gallon of mixed calcium and magnesium hardness. After washing the cloths in the respective test treatments and subsequently drying them, the reflectance of the terry cloths were read using a Hunter Reflectometer.The cleaning performance of both detergent compositions on the stained swatches was excellent. In addition, the control composition, containing only the non ionic and cationic components, yiclded terry cloths having a ref lectance of 53 hunter Whiteness Units, while the second composition, which additionally contained the amide component, yielded terry cloths having a reflectance of 71 hunter Whiteness Units. These data demonstrate the improved soil antiredeposition properties which are obtained by the inclusion of an amide component in the cationic nonionic detergent compositions of the present invention. Substantially similar results are obtained where the amide component is present in such an amount such that the concentration of amide in the washing solution is about 80 pFm, 75 ppm, 65 ppm, 55 ppm, 40 ppm, or 30 ppm. Similar results are also obtained where the amide component used above is replaced by amides having the formula EMI49.1 wherein R1 is Cn alkyl, C10 alkyl, C12 alkyl, C13 alkyl, C15 alkyl or C17 alkyl, and R is hydrogen, methyl, ethyl, propyl, or hydroxymethyl. Excellent results are also obtained ere the nonionic surfactant used above is replaced by the condensation product of C10 alcohol with 3 moles of ethylene oxide, the condensation product of coconut alcohol with 6 moles of ethylene oxide, tlie condensation product of coconut alcohol with 7 moles of ethylene oxide, the condensation product of C12 13 alcohol with 6.5 moles of ethylene oxide, the condensation product of C1415 alcohol with 7 moles of ethylene oxide, or the condensation product ofC12 13 alcohol with 3 moles of ethylene oxide stripped so as to remove nonethoxylated and lower cthoxylate fractions. Exccllent results are also obtained wherein the nonionic component is replaced by a mixture of tile condensation product of C10 alcohol with 3 moles of ethylene oxide toqether with the condensation product of a secondary C15 alcohol with 9 moles of ethylene oxide, in a ratio of lower ehoxylate nonionic to hither ethoxylate nonionic of about 3 1 or the mixture of the conden sation product of coconut alcohol with 5 moles of ethylene oxide together with an alkyl glyceryl ether having the formula EMI50.1 wherein the ratio of nonicnic surfactant to glyceryl ether is about 3 1. Substantially similar results are also obtained wherein tile ratio of nonlonic surfactant to cationic surfactant in the above copositions is 5 1, 10 3, 20 7, 20 9, 2 1, 5 3, or 1 1. Excellent results are also obtained where the cationic component of the above compositions is replaced by C12 a yl trimethylammonium chloride,C14 alkyl trimethylammonium chloride, di C10 alkyl dimethylammonium bromide, di C32 alkyl dimethyl ammonium bromide, tri C8 alkyl methylammonium chloride, or tri C10 alkyl methylammonium bromide.
