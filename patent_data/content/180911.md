# Control method and apparatus for a color printer.

## Abstract
In a control system for a thermal transfer color printer capable of color print, first and second sensors 12, 13 for detecting a printing paper are disposed before and after a platen roller 8 for carrying the printing paper, so that when the printing paper 1 is carried and detected by the first sensor, the printing paper is changed to a low speed and at the same time a thermal head 3 is pressed against the printing paper through an ink film 2 and when the printing paper is detected by the second sensor, the thermal head is supplied with a print signal for color printing.
