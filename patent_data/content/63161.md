## Description
DESCRIPTION TITLE OF THE INVENTION INDUSTRIAL ROBOT TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to an industrial robot.More particularly, the present invention relates to an improvement of a robot hand of an industrial robot in which the range of application of the industrial robot is broadened. BACKGROUND ART For attaining unmanned automation in machining processes, one industrial robot is arranged for one or a plurality of numerically controlled machine tools so that loading and unloading of workpieces or tools to and from the machine tools can be accomplished by the industrial robot.For example, when workpieces are attached to a machine tool by an industrial robot, it is necessary to perform a preparatory operation of arranging the workpieces in order in a predetermined region, and when the workpieces have a heavy weight and it is difficult to carry them manually, a long time is required for accomplishing this preparatory operation. The present invention has been devised in order to solve the above mentioned problems. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved industrial robot which can easily shift objective articles, such as workpieces and pallets placed in a service region of the industrial robot, to a service region of another industrial robot, and which enables the other robot to perform subsequent service operations automatically very easily and assuredly. According to the present invention, there is provided an industrial robot in which a wrist portion can be moved along at least three independent axes, said industrial robot being characterized in that a robot hand connected to said wrist portion is provided with at least one pair of claws extending parallel to each other. BRIEF EXPLANATION OF THE DRAWINGS The accompanying drawings illustrate one embodiment of the industrial robot according to the present invention. Fig. 1 is a perspective view of the robot. Fig. 2 is a side view of the robot hand. Fig. 3 is a back face view of the robot hand. Fig. 4 is a view showing the other side face of the robot hand. BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION The present invention will now be described in detail with reference to an embodiment of the present invention illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Fig. 1 is a partially cutaway perspective view illustrating one embodiment of the industrial robot according to the present invention. In Fig. 1, reference numeral I represents a robot hand especially contrived according to the present invention, and this robot hand 1 is connected to a wrist portion 2. The industrial robot has five control axes, that is, an axis extended along the vertical direction axis Z , a turning axis which turns on a horizontal plane with respect to the vertical axis axis 0 , an axis for a robot arm s which extends and contracts on a horizontal plane axis R , and two independent axes, one being a rotary axis and the other being a swinging axis for the rotary and swinging movements of the wrist portion attached to the top end portion of the robot arm s axes a and ss . A box like robot casing 5 supporting arms 3 and 4 is guided by vertical guide rods 7 arranged on a rotary base member 6, and the box like robot casing 5 is moved along the direction of the axis Z by rotating a ball screw shaft 8 by an electric servo motor 9 for the axis Z. A driving shaft of an electric servo motor 11 for the axis 6 mounted on a base member 10 is connected to a peripheral gear of the rotary base member 6 through a gear, and by rotation of the motor 11, the box like robot casing 5 and the arms 3 and 4 are turned along the axis 6 through the rotary base member 6 and vertical guide rods 7. An electric servo motor 12 for the axis R is arranged within the box like robot casing 5. The rotation of the motor 12 is converted to move the arms 3 and 4 along the axis R through a ball screw shaft 13, a nut 14 and an end plate 15. The rotary and swinging movements of the wrist portion 2, which is attached to the top end portions of the arms 3 and 4 through a reduction mechanism 16, along the axes a and ss, are accomplished by electric servo motors 17 and 18 arranged in the box like robot casing 5. More specifically, rotation of the motor 17 through a shaft 19 and rotation of the motor 18 through a shaft 20 are transmitted to the reduction mechanism 16 through the corresponding arms 3 and 4 to rotate the wrist portion 2 along the axes a and 6, respectively. In Fig. 1, the robot hand 1 is illustrated in the state where the plane of the robot hand 1, including a pair of claws 1 1 and 1 2, occupies the horizontal plane. The paired claws of the robot hand have a relatively narrow plate like shape and they are forkedly extended parallel to each other. Fig. 2 is a side view of the robot hand 1 connected to the wrist portion 2 Fig. 3 is a back face view of the robot hand 1, and Fig. 4 is a view showing the other side face of the robot hand 1. As is seen from Figs. 2 through 4, a pair of guide shafts 22 are secured parallel to each other between both the side walls of a hand casing 21 by bolts 23, and a pair of blocks 24 1 and 24 2 are fitted in the shafts 22. Claws 1 1 and 1 2 are secured onto the blocks 24 1 and 24 2, respectively, by bolts 25 so that the claws 1 1 and 1 2 extend in the direction intersecting the shafts 22 at a right angle. Incidentally, the claw 1 2 is omitted in Fig. 3.The blocks 24 1 and 24 2 are slidable along the shafts 22, and after the distance between the blocks 24 1 and 24 2 has been appropriately adjusted, the blocks 24 1 and 24 2 are secured to the shafts 22 by clamping the bolts 26. Incidentally, reference numerals 27, 28 and 29 represent, respectively, a wrist attachment portion, a hand attachment portion and bolts for connecting both the attachment portions to each other. The operation of the industrial robot of the present invention will now be described. By manual feeding instructions from an instructing operation panel not shown , movements of the robot hand along the respective control axes are performed. More specifically, the positions of the robot hand in the directions of the axes a and ss are determined so that the plane of the robot hand, including the claws 1 1 and 1 2, is substantially horizontal, as shown inFig. 1, and the claws 1 1 and 1 2 are inserted in the lower face of an objective article by movement in the direction of the axis Z and by an extending movement in the direction of the axis R. The claws 1 1 and 1 2 subsequently are elevated by a predetermined quantity along the axis Z to raise up the objective article. Then, by appropriately combining the movements along the axes Z, e and R, the objective article is set at a predetermined position. By repeating the above procedures, objective articles are arranged and set in order on a workpiece stand or the like. As will be apparent from the foregoing description, according to the present invention, even if objective articles are workpieces or pallets having a heavy weight, which can hardly be carried manually by operators, they can easily be shifted by being scooped up from below by the fork shaped hand and can be arranged in order on a predetermined stand or the like. Accordingly, the preparatory operation of arranging the objective articles can remarkably be facilitated.
