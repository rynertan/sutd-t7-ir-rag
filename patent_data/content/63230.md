A cover according to claim 1, wherein said hinge members are secured to the top plane of the machine by means of suitable bolts, resilient means being interposed between the outer ends of said bolts and the undersurface of said top plane and urging constantly said hinge members against the top surface of the top plane. 3. A cover according to the preceding claims, wherein said resilient means comprises suitable springs. 4. A cover according to any one of the preceding claims, substantially as described and as shown in the accompanying drawings.

## Description
Balanced opening cover for the tanks of ice cream making ma chines, pasteurizers and the like. This invention relates to the covers for the tanks of pasteurizers, of ice cream machines and similar machines. In order to close the tanks of these machines, covers are required having the following characteristics a a good thermal insulation, b inside visibility, c constructional simplicity to ensure good cleaning, d possibility of either partial or total balanced opening, e easy removability for washing with running water, f easy maneuverability with one hand by the operator. The main object of the present invention, therefore, is to provide a cover for the specified machines, which will meet all the requirements specified above. According to a main characteristic, the cover according to this invention is made of clear plastics and is provided, at the edge which is hinged to the top edge of the tank, with two co axial pivots protruding laterally outwards and each engaging in a semi circular groove formed in the lower side of the horizontal arm of two hinge members which are substantially shaped as an inverted L and are secured to the top plan of the machine, said hinge members being urged against said top plane by suitable springs. The hinge edge of the cover is provided with cam means cooperating with said top plane so as to provide one or more balanced opening positions. Advantageously, the securing means and the urging springs are located under said top plane. By virtue of this mounting on spring urged hinges, the cover can be easily disengaged from the hinges by moving it, when in the completely opened position, in such a direction as to resiliently disengage the pivots from said hinges. Other characteristics and advantages of this invention will be more apparent from the following detailed description thereof, made with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein Figure 1 is a top plan view of the cover according to the invention, mounted on an ice cream making machine, in the closed position Figure 2 is a fragmentary longitudinal sectional view, on the line II II of Figure 1 Figure 3 is a fragmentary longitudinal sectional view of the cover of Figure 2 during the lifting step, in a partially opened position, while trespassing the dead center thereof Figure 4 is a sectional view similar to Figure 2, with the cover in the position of stable partial opening Figure 5 shows the said cover in the position of total opening and Figure 6 shows the step of disengagement of the cover from its hinges. With reference to the drawings, the numeral 1 indicates the cover, made of clear plastics. One end side of the cover 1 is provided with an operating handle 101, and the opposite end side is provided with two lateral L shaped projections 201 comprising a wing portion 401 merging with the plane portion of the cover, an edge corner 501 cooperating with the plane 2 at the top edge of the tank of the machine, a second end portion 301 extending upwards when the cover is in the closed position. Said projections 201 have each a longitudinal through hole accommodating a pivot shaft 3 so that the two end portions thereof will protrude beyond the outer sides of the wing portions 201. Two hinge members 4 are resiliently secured to the top plane 2 in registry with the end portions of the shaft 3.These hinge members are shaped as an inverted L , and each of them is provided, in the lower side of the horizontal arm thereof, with a semi circular groove 304 having a diametre corresponding to the diametre of the shaft 3. The vertical arm 204 of each hinge member 4 is secured to the plane 2 by means of bolts 5 that traverse suitable holes in the plane 2 and are screwed to said vertical arm of each hinge member 4. Arranged between the heads of the bolts 5 and the plane 2, are springs 6 whereby said hinge members are urged against the plane 2 and yet are permitted to move vertically against the action of the springs 6. The operation of the device described above is now apparent. During the opening step, when the edge corner 501 bears against the plane 2 position shown in Figure 3 , it causes the hinge members 4 to lift against the action of the springs 6, until said corner 501 has moved beyond the vertical passing through the shaft 3, and the hinge members have been moved back against the plane 2 by the springs 6 position shown in Figure 4 . In this position, the cover is partially opened and is firmly held thereat. By further continuing the opening movement, the cover will be brought to the position of total opening, wherein the free end of the wing portion 301 bears against the plane 2 position shown in Fig. 5 . If the cover is to be removed, it is moved from this position in the direction of the arrow A in Figure 6 until the pivot shaft 3 has disengaged from the semi circular grooves 304 of the hinge members 4 position shown in Figure 6 . If the cover is to be re engaged in place, it should be pushed merely against the hinge members 4 in the opposite direction. Of course, this invention is not limitede to the embodiment here shown and described, but it embraces all changes and modifications achieving the same advantages, and falling within the scope of the inventive principle.
