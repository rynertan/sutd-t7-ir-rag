# PROCESS AND APPARATUS FOR FABRICATING OPTICAL FIBER CABLES

## Abstract
A process and apparatus for fabricating an optical fiber communication cable are described herein. In a first aspect of the present invention, smooth operation of a die 18, 20 for forming a metal containment tube 30 for housing at least one optical fiber 14 is promoted by first passing a metal strip 12 through a shaving die 28 to remove any shearing burrs along the strip edges and to maintain the width of the strip 12 within a desired tolerance. In a second aspect of the present invention, various approaches for effectively sealing the con tainment tube 30 are described.
