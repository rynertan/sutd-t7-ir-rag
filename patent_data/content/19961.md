## Description
PREPARATION OF 2,T DIMETHThOCTA 1,T DIE The invention relates to a process for the preparation of 2,7 dimethylocta 1,7 diene by hydrodimerization of isoprene in the presence of a reducing agent, a catalyst comprising palladium complexed with a tertiary organophosphorus ligand and, optionally, of a solvent. 2,7 Dimethylocta 1,7 diene is a chemical intermediate, for example to aroma chemicals. In the process referred to in the beginning, as described in U.S. patent specification 3,732,328, formic acid is used as the reducing agent. This known process, however, allows 2,7 di methylocta 1,7 diene with a low selectivity, 3,6 dimethylocta 1,T diene primarily being formed. The selectivity, expressed as a percentage, to a certain compound, is defined as a 100 box100 wherein a is the amount of isoprene converted to this certain compound and b is the total amount of converted isoprene. The Applicants have now found that the use of a certain reducing agent allows a high selectivity to 2,7 dimethylocta1,7 diene, a mixture of dimethylocta 1,7 dienes having greater than fifty mol. per cent of the 2,7 dimethyl 1,7 diene isomer being formed. Accordingly, the invention provides a process for the preparation of 2,7 dimethylocta l ,7 diene by hydro dimerization of isoprene in the presence of a reducing agent, a catalyst comprising palladium complexed with a tertiary organophosphorus ligand and, optionally, of a solvent, characterized in that potassium formate is used as the reducing agent in the presence of water. Water must be present in the reaction mixture in greater than trace amounts. Preferred molar amounts of water are at least equal to the molar amount of potassium formate. Typically, the water will range from 1 to 5 mol. of water per mol. of potassium formate. Solvents are not essential to the process of this invention, but a good organic solvent can promote the rate of reaction by a factor of two or more. Non polar solvents, such as paraffinic, cycloparaffinic or aromatic solvents are useful in the process of this invention.The solvent can be a paraffin or cycloparaffin containing 5 to 16 carbon atoms per molecule, such as hexane, dodecane, pentadecane, cyclohexane and methylcyclohexane. Suitable solvents also include aromatic hydrocarbons, such as benzene, lower alkyl substituted aromatic hydrocarbons, such as toluene, m , p and o xylene, halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons including chloro , bromo and iodo substituted, for example, chlorobenzene. Halogenated lower aliphatic compounds, such as chloroform, methylene chloride and carbon tetrachloride may be used in particular chloroform is preferred. Further useful solvents are amine solvents. A wide range of amines are useful, provided that they are liquid under reaction conditions. Tertiary amines are preferred to primary and secondary amines. Suitable amine solvents include alkyl amines, cycloalkyl amines, aryl amines and iterocyclic amines, such as morpholine, pyridine, piperazine and piperidine. Examples of these classes of amines are the lower alkylamines containing 2 to 6 carbon atoms in each alkyl group, such as triethyl amine mono cyclohexyl amine, and N alkyl cyclohexyl amines containing up to 12 carbon atoms per molecule aniline and N alkyl anilines containing up to 12 carbon atoms per molecule and N alkyl morpholines containing up to 12 carbon atoms per molecule. Further useful solvents are those of moderate co ordinating ability, and which include nitriles, such as lower alkyl nitriles, hydrocarbon aromatic nitriles including acetonitrile and benzonitrile, amides including benzamide, acetamide, mono and di substituted amides where the substituent is preferably lower alkyl. Suitable substituted amides include N methyloacetamide, N,N dimethyLacetamide and dimethyl formamide. Diallyl sulphoxides, such as dimethyl sulphoxide and sulphones, such as sulfolane tetrahydrothiophene 1, 1 dioxide and alkyl substituted sulfolane are satisfactory. By dialkyl it is meant that the sulphur and nitrogen atoms are connected to two different carbon atoms.They may be separate alkyl groups or the same, i.e., a ring alkyl group, e.g., tetramethylene sulphoxide and N methylpyrrolidinone. The alkyl moieties have carbon numbers ranging from 1 to 6. Simple ethers, such as the di lower alkyl ethers including dimethyl ether and diethyl ether, function satisfactorily. Hydrocarbon aromatic ethers, such as the lower alkyl phenyl ethers may be also used. In addition, the cyclic diethers, such as 1,4 dioxane are also suitable solvents. Simple lower alkyl esters of lower alkanoic acids, such as ethyl acetate, methyl acetate and methyl butyrate as well as cyclic diesters, such as ethylene carbonate, are also suitable solvents of moderate co ordinating ability. Ketones, including lower aliphatic ketones, such as ethyl methyl ketone and hydrocarbon aromatic ketones, such as acetophenone, are also satisfactory solvents. Lower mono and di alkanols, such as isopropanol and ethylene glycol msy. be used, if desired. The preferred solvents of moderate co ordinating ability include nitriles, formamides, such as dimethylvformamide, di lower alkyl ethers, lower alkyl phenyl ethers, simple lower alkyl esters of lower alkanoic acids, ketones and lower alkanols. The particularly preferred solvents utilized in this invention include benzene, dimethyl,formamide, chlorobenzene, anisol, N,N dimethylacetamide, nitromethane, ethyl acetate, isopropanol, benzonitrile, chloroform, ethyl methyl ketone, acetonitrile, diethyl ether, acetophenone, toluene, ethylene glycol, ethylene carbonate, propylene carbonate and sulfolane.Particularly desired solvents are dimethyloformamide, N methylpyrrolidinone and dimethyl sulphoxide, which are good solvents for potassium formate. The preferred organic solvents will have carbon numbers ranging from 1 to 20. Particularly desired solvents are those which give two phase systems which allow easy product separation, for example nitromethane, ethylene carbonate and propylene carbonate. The amount of solvent added should be sufficient to dissolve the palladium complexed with a tertiary organo phosphorus ligand. Potassium formate is utilized in this process to provide the hydrogen for the hydrodimerization. It is desirable that some potassium formate be present during the entire course of the reaction. When operating the process batch wise, this can be accomplished by adding a stoichiometric amount of potassium formate initially, 1 mol. of potassium formate for every 2 mol. of isoprene, or by continuously or periodically adding additional amounts of potassium formate. The catalyst used in the process of this invention is palladium or a palladium compound complexed with a tertiary organo phosphorus ligand. The palladium may be in any of its possible valence states, e.g., 0, 2, etc. with the zero valence preferred. Suitable palladium compounds include the palladium carboxylates, particularly palladium carboxylates derived from alkanoic acids containing up to six carbon atoms per molecule, such as palladium acetate OAC , complexes such as palladium acetyl acetonate AcAc , bis benzonitrile palladium II and lithium palladous chloride as well as the palladium halides, nitrates and sulphates, such as palladous chloride and palladium nitrate Pd N03 2 0H2 and palladium sulphate. Suitable reduced palladium phosphine complexes are Pd R3P 2 or Pd R3P 3. The palladium is present in the reaction mixture in catalytic amounts preferably from 1 to 10 6 molar and more preferably from 10 1 to 10 4 molar. The palladium compounds complexed with a tertiary organophosphorus ligand are typically prepared by reacting the tertiary organo phosphorus ligand with the appropriate palladium compound as, for example, represented by the following equations EMI5.1 where R3P is a tertiary organo phosphine or may be made in situ by adding the palladium compound and the phosphine directly to the reactor. Any tertiary organo phosphorus ligand which can be dissolved in the reaction mixture may be used. Preferred ligands are represented by the formula RO aPRb I wherein the R groups which may be the same or different, attached to the phosphorus or oxygen atoms, represent hydrocarbyl groups, a is an integer from 0 to 3 and b is 3 a. Preferably, each R in formula I represents an aryl, alkyl, aralkyl or alkaryl group, each with less than 20 carbon atoms, preferably less than 12 carbon atoms. Suitable examples of groups represented by R are phenyl, p tolyl, o tolyl, m tolyl, m chlorophenyl, p anisoyl, m anisoyl, methyl, ethyl, propyl and butyl groups with methyl, ethyl, n propyl, n butyl, phenyl and chlorophenyl groups being preferred.It is also suitable for the organic radical R to contain functional groups or to satisfy more than one of the valences of the phosphorus atom, thereby forming a heterocyclic compound with the phosphorus atom. Preferably R represents aryl, alkyl, aralkyl, alkaryl or a mixture thereof having carbon numbers from 1 to 20, preferably 1 to about 12 carbon atoms and need not be the same, e.g., R1R2R3P, R10 PR2R3 and R10 R20 PR3.Preferably R represents an alkyl or aryl group and each R is the same. Alternatively the formula for the ligand can be expressed as RCRdRe P 0R4 f OR5 g OR6 h where c, d, e, f, g and h individually equals 0 or 1, c d e f g h equals 3 and R is as defined above. In the most preferred tertiary organo phosphorus ligands at least one R represents a benzyl group or a branched alkyl, aralkyl, alkenyl or cycloalkyl group, each of the latter four groups having from 3 to 10 carbon atoms with branching occurring at a carbon atom no more than two carbon atoms from the phosphorus or oxygen atom. This preferred R provides a steric hindrance to the catalyst complex which enhances selectivity. Illustrative of the preferred R moiety are, for alkyl, isopropyl, sec. butyl, tert. butyl, isobutyl, neopentyl, sec.pentyl, tert. pentyl, 2 methylbutyl, sec. hexyl, tert. hexyl, 2,2 dimethylpropyl for aralkyl, alpha methylbenzyl, alpha,alphadimethylbenzyl, alpha methyl alpha ethylbenzyl, phenylethyl, phenylisopropyl, phenyl tert. butyl for alkenyl,allyl, crotyl, methallyl, 1 methylethenyl, 1 methyl 2 propenyl, 2 methyl 2propenyl, 1,1 dimethyl 2 propenyl, 1 methyl 3 butenyl and, for cycloalkyl, cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl and cycloheptyl. Two or more of the ligands of formula I may be used in the same reaction. The mol. ratio of tertiary phosphorus ligand to palladium is suitably at least 1. Preferably, the mol. ratio of ligand to palladium ranges from 1 1 to 20 1 and more preferably from 2 1 to 5 1. The use of the tertiary organo phosphorus ligands of the invention provides extremely high selectivities to 2,7 dimethylocta 1,7 diene. Alternatively, the palladium or palladium compound and tertiary organo phosphorus ligand may be bound onto a crosslinked synthetic resin instead of being dissolved in the reaction medium. Suitable cross linked synthetic resins include cross linked polystyrene, poly alpha alkyl acrylates, poly carbonates and polyamides. In the generic sense, the bound ligand will have the generic formula Z P OR iRÅa, wherein R is as defined above, i is an integer from 0 to 2, Åa is 2 i and Z represents a cross linked synthetic resin. The bound tertiary phosphine may have the general formula EMI7.1 wherein R, i and j are defined previously, and R6 represents the repeating unit of the synthetic resin and where m is a positive integer, n is O or a positive integer, m n equals the total number of repeating units in the resin and the percentage of the repeating units substituted with the tertiary phosphine is represented by the formula m x 100Z. m n The number of repeating units substituted with the tertiary phosphine is not critical. When less than 5 of the repeating units contain a phosphorus substitute, large quantities of the resin must be used to form the bound catalyst. Accordingly, it is desirable to have at least 10 of the repeating units substituted with a tertiary phosphorus. It is preferred, however, that from 20 to 40 of the repeating units contain a phosphorus substituent. The substituent can be introduced into the resin using well known techniques, such as those described in theJournal of the American Chemical Society, 97 7 1749 1975 and in Ann. N.Y.Academy of Sciences, 239, 76 1974 . In accordance with those techniques, the palladium compound is complexed with the phosphorus substituted resin by admixing in a solvent for the palladium compound. The catalyst may be pretreated to enhance reactivity by contacting it with a reducing agent at a temperature of from 20 to 900C for from 0.1 to 5 hours. The reducing agent may be gaseous, solid or liquid. Examples of gaseous reducing agents are hydrogen and carbon monoxide. Examples of liquid or solid reducing agents are hydrazine, NaBH4, maOCH3, isopropyl 3P,Cu, Na, and Al alkyls. The reduction may be carried out in a separate autoclave or preferably is carried out in the hydrodimerization reactor prior to the introduction of the isoprene.The palladium complexed with a tertiary organo phosphorus ligand may be dissolved in the solvent used in this invention prior to reduction. The process can be either continuous or batch. The reaction temperature of the process is not critical, however, it is preferred to maintain the reaction between 0 to 100 C, preferably between 20 to 70 C. The process is conducted under a sufficient pressure to maintain liquid phase conditions at the reaction temperature. Typically the pressure is autogenous. The invention will now be illustrated by the followingExamples.EXAMPLES 1 4 To a 90 millilitre glass lined autoclave were charged 0.027 mmi. of palladium acetylacetonate, 0.054 mud. isopropyl 3phosphine, 18.5 nnnol. of potassium formate, 10 ml of the solvent listed in Table I, 1 ml 55.5 nnnol.
