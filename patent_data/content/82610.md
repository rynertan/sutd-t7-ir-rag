# Railway container and car.

## Abstract
An improved container 10 for bulk cargo is provided with a peripheral wall 12, 14, 18 , a top 30 , and a bottom 20 . The top 30 defines a longitudinally extending central ridge 31 and the bottom 20 defines two spaced, parallel, longitudinally extending skirts 34, 36 separated by a central recess 28 . The contour of the top 30 generally corresponds to the contour of the bottom 20 such that multiple containers 10 can be stacked one over the other. The container 10 is provided with a perforated floor which simultaneously braces the peripheral wall 12, 14, 16, 18 against spreading and provides a support surface for palletized cargo and the like. The floor perforations allow bulk cargo to fall from the upper portions of the container to the lower portions of the container 10 . A bulk cargo loading door 44 is provided in the top 30 along the uppermost portion of the central ridge 31 , and two bulk unloading doors 46 are provided along the lowermost portions of the skirts 34, 36 . In addition end doors 48 are provided for moving palletized cargo into and out of the container 10 . The container of this invention can be transported on a railway car of the type having an elongated central spine snaped to fit within the central recess 28 of the container 10 . This railway car defines four container attachment structures 114 , each of which supports the container 10 at a point well below the uppermost level of the spine. In this way, the center of gravity of the container 10 is kept low and close to the ground.
