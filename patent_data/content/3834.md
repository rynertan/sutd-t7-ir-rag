## Abstract
A retainer for skis and ski poles which, when used in two or more, forms a unitary assembly of a pair of skis and ski poles. Each retainer comprises a web band 10 for encircling a pair of skis in bottom to bottom parallel alignment and, attached thereto, a clamp block 45 having a pair of parallel, coextensive through bores 44, 46 for receiving the ski poles and a lock 53, 54 to secure said clamp block in gripping engagement of the received ski poles. Preferably the entire retainer is molded of a resilient elastomer, e.g., rubber and the like. The assembly of the skis and ski poles employs a pair of the retainers, at opposite ends of the assembly securing the skis in parallel, bottom to bottom array, and a parallel array of the ski poles.
