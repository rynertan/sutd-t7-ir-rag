# Glass forming composition containing metal fluorides.

## Abstract
Novel halide glass forming compositions in the CdF₂ AlF₃ PbF₂ and CdF₂ AlF₃ PbF₂ LiF composition fields are disclosed comprising in molar percent 20 46 CdF₂, 22 52 AlF₃ and 18 44 PbF₂ and optionally up to 20 LiF wherein the sum total of the mole percent of CdF₂ AlF₃ PbF₂ is at least 80 mole persent of the composition and wherein tha molar ratio of CdF₂ PbF₂ is greater than 1 2. The composition exhibit unusual glass stability. The constituents of these glasses are potentially vapor transportable, so that very pure glass articles can be produced exhibiting excellent infrared transparency.
