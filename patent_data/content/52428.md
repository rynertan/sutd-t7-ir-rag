# A spacer for supporting a heat detector cable.

## Abstract
A spacer 1 for a heat detecting cable 14 has a moulded column 2 with a cross section formed by a number of arms 3, 4, 5, 6 projecting from a web or centre. A tie 15 on the column or a slot 46 in the column holds the detector cable against the column and spaced from the connection with a cable tray. The column is preferably cruciform in cross section, but alternatively can be H , T , Y , or B shaped.
