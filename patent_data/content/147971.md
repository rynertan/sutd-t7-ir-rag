# Split back die segment.

## Abstract
A die segment for a crimp machine in which a plurality of such segments are disposed in a bowl to surround a coupling to be crimped, with crimping being effected by forced movement of the die segments toward a narrowed end of the bowl, typically by a hydraulic ram. Each of the segments is wedge shaped having a cylindrical inner face for engagement with the cylindrical sleeve of the coupling and a relatively large conical outer face matching the shape of the conical bowl and for engagement therewith for positioning the array of die segments and for guiding movement of the die segments radially inwardly. The outer face of each die segment is split into spaced, axially extended, contact surfaces 40 which provide improved alignment and force transmission characteristics.
