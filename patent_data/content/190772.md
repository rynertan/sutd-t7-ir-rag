# Electrically conductive plastics material.

## Abstract
An electrically conductive plastics material for use as a metal halogen battery electrode comprises a mixture of the systhetic base resin material, an electrically conductive carbon black and graphite. The material is suitable for use as an electrode for metal halogen batteries because of its resistance to diffusion of halogen and to degradation, while its volume resistivity is not affected by variations in temperature.
