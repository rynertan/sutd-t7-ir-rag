# YARN FEED DEVICE FOR A CIRCULAR KNITTING MACHINE

## Abstract
A feed device for a circular knitting machine capable of positively feeding the needles with an adequate amount of yarn without the needles having to require the necessary yarn by pulling it and increasing its tension is disclosed. it comprises two sets of toothed rollers 8, 9 adapted to mesh without the respective teeth 23 thereof making contact and a yarnguide 30 for each pair of rollers 8, 9 capable of adopting an operative position in which the yarn 4 guided by the eyelets 33 of the yarnguide 30 runs between the teeth 23 or an inoperative position in which the yarn 4 is spaced from the rollers. In the operative position it is contem plated that the rollers 8, 9 may be moved farther apart, whereby the yarn 4 feed speed is reduced.
