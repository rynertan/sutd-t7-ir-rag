# Digital quadrature amplitude modulator.

## Abstract
In a quadrature amplitude modulator, two binary, syn chronous data signals representing four possible phase states of a carrier signal are sampled and respectively fed into two shift registers comprising part of a finite impulse response lowpass filter. The samples in each corresponding pair of stages in the shift registers are multiplexed at twice the carrier frequency. Each multiplexer output is then added modulo two to a binary signal at the carrier frequency using exclusive OR gates. The gate outputs are weighted in a desired fashion and summed and converted to an analog signal which exhibits a preferred spectral shape. This approach enables the quadrature amplitude modulation function to be included within the structure of the finite impulse response lowpass filter. The binary synchronous nature of the input data enables the structure of the filter to be simplified and the number of multiplexers and modulo two adders to be reduced to a number equal to the number of bits stored from the input sequences. An extension of this basic concept includes higher levels of encoding, specifically the case of sixteen or more possible phase and amplitude states of a carrier signal. The particular method for weighting and summing the multiplexed and modulated signals may utilize digital logic combined with resistors, switched capaci tors, or a stored program combined with a digital to analog converter, and is suitable for integrated circuit fabrication.
