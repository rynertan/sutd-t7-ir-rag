# Apparatus for, and a method of, inserting tape mounted terminals into apertures in a workpiece.

## Abstract
Apparatus for inserting tape 168 mounted on electrical terminals 170, 172 into apertures 174, 176 in a connector housing 178 , comprises an assembly 16 for gripping the terminals 170, 172 and which is movable towards the housing 178 to insert the terminals 170, 172 into the apertures 174, 176 . The tape 168 is initially positioned on one side of a fixed mandrel 158 , such side being remote from the housing 178 with the terminals 170, 172 straddling the mandrel 158 and a shuttle 148 parked against the opposite side of the mandrel 158 . Jaws 140, 142 of the gripping assembly 16 entrain the shuttle 148 as the assembly 16 moves towards the housing 178 and so withdraw the terminals 170, 172 from the tape 168 .
