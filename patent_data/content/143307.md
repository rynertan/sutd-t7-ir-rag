# Cyclic hexapeptide somatostatin analogs process for their preparation and pharmaceutical compositions containing them.

## Abstract
Somatostatin analogs are prepared wherein a cyclic hexapeptide contains a secondary amino acid which re places seven of the ring amino acids of somatostatin. The cyclic hexapeptides are easier to synthesize, have a longer duration of activity, and many have a greater level of activity than somatostatin. The compounds have the properties of inhibiting the release of glucagon, growth hormone and insulin. Certain of the compounds also are capable of in hibiting the release of gastric acid secretions. The com pounds are particularly useful in the treatment of acromega ly, diabetes, diabetic retinopathy and peptic ulcers. These cyclic hexapeptides are prepared by the solid phase meth od.
