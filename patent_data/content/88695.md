## Description
The present invention relates to the covalent attachment of antibodies, including monoclonal antibodies and polyclonal antibodies conventional antisera , to soluble conjugate partners compounds or linkers to form antibody conjugates which are useful in a variety of diagnostic and therapeutic applications. More particularly, the invention is directed to methods of attachment to the carbohydrate moieties of an antibody molecule located outside the antigen binding domain of the antibody molecule. The product conjugates substantially retain the entire immunospecificity and immunoreactivity of the antibodies from which they are made, and further retain the ability to activate complement. This invention also relates to the general area of carrier systems capable of delivering compounds to target sites The present invention also includes the attachment of a substrate linker to an antibody so that the resulting antibody conjugates retain the ability to bind antigen and activate complement. In selected applications, this promotes the release of the compound in its active form at the target site. Various reactions can be used to covalently attach compounds to antibodies. This has been accomplished by reaction of the amino acid residues of the antibody molecule, including the amine groups of lysine, the free carboxylic acid groups of glutamic and aspartic acid, the sulfhydryl groups of cysteine and the various moieties of the aromatic amino acids. There are serious disadvantages to these methods of covalent attachment to the polypeptide backbone of an antibody molecule. The amino acid sequences of the light and heavy chains of immunoglobulins contain all of the amino acids relatively regularly and randomly dispersed throughout the molecule, including the antigen binding region. To the extent any chemical modification occurs in this antigen binding region, one has introduced a change in the recognition element of the antibody. Such changes would be expected to, and, in fact do, change the affinity and specificity of the antibody for antigen. In a population of different antibodies, such alteration in the antigen binding region results in complete inactivation of some antibodies and in lesser degrees of inactivation of others in relation to the proximity of the alteration to the antigen binding site. This inactivation may be due to a change within the antigen binding site to change the conformation of the binding site so as to make it unreactive, or may be due to a change in a region outside the antigen binding region so as to limit access of antigen to the antigen binding region. Probably the most commonly used non specific method of covalent attachment is the carbodiimide reaction to link carboxy groups of a compound to amino groups of the antibody. Additionally, bifunctional agents such as dialdehydes or imidoesters have been used to link the amino group of a compound to amino groups of the antibody molecule. Some investigators have used the Schiff base reaction to link compounds to antibody molecules. This method involves the periodate oxidation of a drug or cytotoxic agent that contains a glycol or hydroxy group, thus forming an aldehyde which is then reacted with the antibody molecule. Attachment occurs via formation of a Schiff base with amino groups of the antibody molecule. Additionally, compounds with reactive sulfhydryl groups have been coupled to antibody molecules. Isothiocyanate can be used as a coupling agent for covalently attaching compounds to antibodies. This method has been used to attach fluorescent compounds to antibody molecules for use in fluorescence microscopy Brandtzaeg, 1973, Scand. J. Immunol. Interchain disulfide bonds can also be used as sites of covalent attachment. If one is successful in selectively reducing only the interchain disulfide bonds, several functional properties of the antibody may be adversely affected, such as functional affinity, agglutination ability and the ability to fix complement. Alternative methods of attachment to antibody molecules outside the antigen binding region outside the variable domains may involve use of antibodies directed against the constant domain of the antibody molecule, or use of Staphylococcal protein A which is known to bind specifically to a site on the constant region. Since these modes of attachment are non covalent, either approach is limited and would not be efficient for separation and purification schemes. Any dissociation of antigen would likely lead to release of antibody from the support to which it is non covalently attached, so selective elution of antigen cannot be accomplished. Additionally, with respect to carrier systems see Section 2.3 , since non covalent bonds are more likely to be broken before the antibody complex reaches the target site, covalent linkages are preferred. A number of agents have been utilized as carrier molecules with limited success in drug delivery systems. In practice the carrier should be non toxic and target site specific. Ideally there should be a mechanism for release of the active form of the compound from the carrier at the target site. Carrier molecules such as DNA, liposomes, proteins, steroid hormones, and antibodies whole antibody molecules or Fab fragments have been used in conjunction with a broad spectrum of pharmaceutical or cytotoxic agents such as radioactive compounds Liposome mediated delivery of pharmaceutical agents has major drawbacks because of its lack of target specificity. Recently, investigators have attempted to overcome this problem by covalently attaching whole antibody or Fab fragments to liposomes containing a pharmaceutical agent Heath Most investigators have recognized another major problem inherent in the liposome targeting system, which is that binding of the targeted liposomes to the target cell does not ensure incorporation of the liposome contents, hence, the pharmaceutical agent, into the target cell Weinstein Finally, if the liposome is internalized into the target cell, there is no assurance that the pharmaceutical agent will be released in its active form. After phagocytosis the liposome contents are packaged within lysosomes of the target cell. The array of proteolytic enzymes contained within the lysosome may either degrade the pharmaceutical agent or render the agent inactive by altering its structure or cleaving the active site. The variety of proteolytic enzymes contained in the lysosome makes it very difficult, if not impossible, to devise bonding arrangements that will allow release of the pharmaceutical agent in its active form. Thus, reliance upon the enzyme content of the target cell lysosomes is, at best, a haphazard system to effect release of the active form of the pharmaceutical agent. A number of investigators have reported target systems involving attachment of compounds or pharmaceutical agents directly to conventional antibodies, monoclonal antibodies, or to Fab portions of antibodies directed against tumor antigens. See review articles, Various investigators have examined proteins other than antibodies as carriers in a target system. For example, desialylated glycoproteins are preferentially taken up by hepatocytes. See review articles, Although antibody carrier systems are more specific for the target than are the liposome carrier systems, a significant problem exists in the release of the pharmaceutical agent at the target site. As in the liposome mediated systems, the antibody drug compounds must be internalized by the tumor cell so that the drug can be released through cleavage by lysosomal enzymes see review articles, Radiopharmaceutical techniques currently used in non invasive FR A 2 418 237 discloses a process for obtaining compounds based on glycoproteins, usable as insolubilized glycoproteins or as markers. DE A 2 651 680 describes a method for attaching an amino containing solid, insoluble support to a carbohydrate residue of an organic compound. GB A 2 013 688 describes insolubilized compositions of antibodies or antigens coupled to a water insoluble substrate. EP A 0 044 167 discloses conjugates in which the attachment between the antibody and a cytotoxic agent is via a disulfide bond. The present invention relates to the covalent attachment of compounds to antibody molecules so that the resulting antibody conjugates retain the ability to bind antigen and activate complement. In particular, such methods of attachment consist in attachment to the carbohydrate moieties of antibodies. In a prefered embodiment, the present invention is concerned with covalent attachment to the carbohydrate moieties of the heavy chains of antibodies, and, generally, to the CH₂ domain. Since the carbohydrate is the constant region of the antibody outside the variable domain , modification of the carbohydrate According to the preferred embodiment, antibodies are modified by covalent attachment to the carbohydrate moiety using known reagents and reactions. Instead of dealing with protein chemistry, the present applicants utilize those reactions of carbohydrate chemistry unique to carbohydrates to modify the carbohydrate of the glycoproteins. In principle, there are may different enzymatic and non enzymatic reactions that are directed primarily, if not exclusively, to carbohydrate moieties. The object of the invention is a soluble antibody conjugate for a medical use comprising a water soluble therapeutic or diagnostic compound containing an amine group selected from the group consisting of secondary amine, hydrazine, hydrazide, hydroxylamine, phenylhydrazine and semicarbazide, attached through a covalent bond to an aldehyde group of an oxidized carbohydrate moiety of an antibody or antibody fragment said covalent bond between said amine group and said aldehyde group being an enamine, hydrazone, oxime, phenylhydrazone, semicarbazone or a reduced form thereof, and said soluble antibody conjugate having i substantially the same immunoreactivity and immunospecificity as the unconjugated antibody or antibody fragment, and ii aqueous solubility, such that the conjugate is suitable for Another object is also a soluble antibody conjugate for a medical use, comprising a water soluble therapeutic or diagnostic compound which comprises a water soluble linker attached to a second compound containing an amine group selected from the group consisting of primary amine, secondary amine, hydrazine, hydrazide, hydroxylamine phernylhydrazine and semicarbazide attached through a covalent bond to an aldehyde group of an oxidized carbohydrate moiety of an antibody or antibody fragment said covalent bond between said amine group and said aldehyde group being an imine, enamine, hydrazone, oxime, phenylhydrazone, semicarbazone or a reduced form thereof, and said soluble antibody conjugate having i substantially the same immunoreactivity and immunospecificity as the conjugated antibody or antibody fragment, and ii aqueous solubility such that the conjugate is suitable for The product conjugates of the present invention have been found to retain substantial, if not complete. immunoreactivity and immunospecificity. When such conjugates are prepared using monoclonal antibodies, the association constant and index of heterogeneity are unaffected by the present mode of covalent modification, whereas conventional means of modification decrease the average binding constant and introduce functional heterogeneity. Furthermore, the reagents usable with the novel techniques of the invention can be extremely selective so that there is no detectable reaction of the polypeptide portion of the antibody molecule. This procedure can be performed on intact molecules or functional monovalent fragments of antibodies. Finally, the modification can be done with a variety of antibody classes, including IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG and IgM, and antibodies from any source, including monoclonal antibodies. This invention also encompasses the use of antibodies as carrier molecules for the targeting of a compound or compounds for delivery to specific cells, tissues, organs, or any other site Antibodies directed against any desired target Once administered According to one process of the present invention, a compound is attached to an antibody carrier molecule of an immunoglobulin class that is capable of complement activation. This attachment is accomplished via linkers which are susceptible to cleavage by one or more of the activated complement enzymes, and one or more different compounds may be attached to each antibody molecule. The resulting antibody conjugate is administered to an individual. Subsequent to the binding of the modified antibody and antigen For the practice of this invention it is desirable to attach the compound to the antibody molecule without interfering with either the antigen binding capacity of the antibody, or with the ability to activate complement also called complement fixation . The present invention describes the novel linkers and methods of attachment which may be used to attach compounds to any antibody capable of activating complement. Alternatively, certain techniques, such as tumor imaging, require that the compound remain attached to the target site. In an alternate embodiment, when cleavage at the target site is Finally, for delivery of other compounds, The present invention may be more fully understood by reference to the following detailed description of the invention, examples of specific embodiments of the invention and the appended figures in which Glycoproteins are one of the several types of biologically important macromolecules which have found application in selected therapeutic and or diagnostic settings. Although the currently recognized classes of glycoproteins are far from complete, a catalog of such materials would include immunoglobulins, serum complement components, a variety of enzymes, cell surface histocompatibility antigens and cell surface receptors. These compounds have carbohydrate residues which are covalently attached to a polypeptide backbone. Antibodies are one class of glycoproteins whose carbohydrate moieties are generally located on the heavy chain of the immunoglobulin molecule. See FIG. 1 for a schematic representation of several immunoglobulins. The Fab or Fab fragments of any immunoglobulins which contain carbohydrate moieties may also be utilized in the reaction scheme described herein. The Fab fragments of IgG immunoglobulins are obtained by cleaving the antibody molecule with pepsin resulting in a bivalent fragment, Fab ₂ or with papain resulting in two univalent fragments, 2 Fab . According to the present invention, antibodies directed against any antigen or hapten may be used. Although conventional antibodies antisera may be used, monoclonal antibodies offer several advantages. Each monoclonal antibody is specific for one antigenic determinant. In addition, unlimited amounts of each monoclonal antibody can be produced. Antibodies used in the present invention may be directed against any determinant, Drugs of particular interest are opioids, amphetamines, barbiturates, steroids, catecholamines, dilantin, theophylline, histamine, cannabinoids, and the like. For a more complete list of antigens, see U.S. Patent 4,193,983, particularly columns 7 11, which patent specification is incorporated herein by reference. When delivery and release of the compound attached to the antibody are desired, immunoglobulins of the IgM class or certain subclasses of IgG should be used since these are the types of immunoglobulin that are known to activate complement. In other applications carrier immunoglobulins may be used which are not capable of complement activation. Such immunoglobulin carriers may include certain classes of antibodies such as IgA, IgD, IgE certain subclasses of IgG or certain fragments of immunoglobulins, In addition to the utilization of conventional methods, the present invention includes several novel methods for attaching compounds to the carbohydrate moieties of the antibody molecule. Whichever method is used, the attachment must not significantly change the essential characteristics of the antibody, such as immunospecificity and immunoreactivity. Additional considerations include simplicity of reaction and stability of the antibody conjugate produced. As explained in detail below, the carbohydrate side chains of antibodies may be selectively oxidized to generate aldehydes. The resulting aldehydes may then be reacted with amine groups Alternatively, the carbohydrate moiety of the antibody may be modified by enzymatic techniques so as to enable attachment to or reaction with other chemical groups. One example of such an enzyme is galactose oxidase which oxidizes galactose in the presence of oxygen. Oxidation of the carbohydrate portion or moiety of antibody molecules leads to formation of aldehyde groups. A variety of oxidizing agents can be used, such as periodic acid, paraperiodic acid, sodium metaperiodate and potassum metaperiodate. Among these, oxygen acids and salts thereof are preferred since secondary or undesirable side reactions are less frequent. For a general discussion, see Jackson, 1944, Oxidation of antibodies with these oxidizing agents can be carried out by known methods. In the oxidation, the antibody is used generally in the form of an aqueous solution, the concentration being generally less than 100 mg mℓ, preferably 1 to 20 mg mℓ. When an oxygen acid or a salt thereof is used as the oxidizing agent, it is used generally in the form of an aqueous solution, and the concentration is generally 0.001 to 10mM and preferably 1.0 to 50mM. The amount of the oxygen acid or salt thereof depends on the kind of antibody, but generally it is used in excess, for example, twice to ten times as much as the amount of the oxidizable carbohydrate. The optimal amount, however, can be determined by routine experimentation. In the process for oxidizing antibodies with oxygen acids or salts thereof, the optional ranges include a pH of from about 4 to 8, a temperature of from 0 to 37 C, and a reaction period of from about 15 minutes to 12 hours. During the oxidation of the glycoprotein with an oxygen acid or a salt thereof, light is preferably excluded to prevent over oxidation of the glycoprotein. Oxidation of the carbohydrate portion of antibody molecules may also be done with the enzyme, galactose oxidase Cooper, The antibody conjugates of the invention may be produced by reacting the oxidized antibody with any suitable conjugate partner having an available amine group. The immediately resulting products antibody conjugates contain a carbon nitrogen double bond resulting from elimination of a molecule of water from the initial addition products For a general discussion of the reaction of aldehydes with hydrazides, see March, 1978, A solution of the oxidized antibody at a concentration of from about 0.5 to 20 mg mℓ is mixed with the conjugate partner molar ratios of reactive conjugate partner group to antibody aldehyde ranging from about 1 to about 10,000 and the solution incubated for from about 1 to 18 hours. Suitable temperatures are from 0 to 37 C and pH may be from about 6 to 8. After the antibody conjugates have been formed between the antibody and its conjugate partner as described in Section 5.2.1.3, the antibody conjugates can optionally be stabilized with a suitable reducing agent, such as sodium cyanoborohydride or sodium borohydride Reducing agent is generally added to a molar excess of from about 10 to 100 fold molar excess over available aldehyde groups. For a general discussion, see Jentoft and Dearborn, 1979, J. Biol. Chem. According to the methods of the invention, antibodies can be attached to any suitable conjugate partner. The major limiting factor is that the attachment reaction must 1 be selective enough to limit competing, undesirable reactions and 2 be sufficiently mild so as not to severely interfere with antibody reactivity and selectivity. For purposes of description, conjugate partners are divided into a compounds of interest, which are attached directly to the antibody and b soluble linkers. The conjugate partner to which the antibodies are attached may be any compound which retains its essential properties after reaction with the antibody, and which enables the antibody to substantially retain immunospecificty and immunoreactivity. For example, when it is desired to attach an aldehyde of the oxidized carbohydrate portion of a glycoprotein to a conjugate compound, the compound should desirably contain a reactive group such as an amino or hydrazide group. Such conjugate compounds include various proteins, such as hormones, enzymes, transport proteins, catalysts, chelating compounds, receptor proteins and immunoglobulins and fluorescent or chemiluminescent compounds or potentially fluorescent or chemiluminescent compounds. By potentially fluorescent or chemiluminescent compounds is meant compounds which fluoresce or chemiluminesce only after reaction, modification or combination with another agent. Where a compound of interest does not contain an amino group, the compound can be modified to make an amino or hydrazide group available for coupling. The compound to be attached to an antibody for use in a delivery system is selected according to the purpose of the intended application According to the invention, antibodies may be covalently attached to any compound of interest through an intermediate soluble linking agent, or linker, having a number of reactive groups, one to react with antibody and one to react with the compound of interest or to an insoluble support. The linker must be chosen such that neither the reaction with antibody or a compound of interest nor the final product adversely affect antibody reactivity and selectivity. In general, these linkers would include heterobifunctional linkers such as mercaptoethanolamine which would bond to the oxidized antibody via its amino group. After deblocking the sulfur atom, free sulfhydryl groups would be available for further reaction. The linker may be of any appropriate size to permit the distance between the antibody and the compound of interest to be selected as desired. According to one embodiment of the present invention, a compound may be attached to an antibody directed against a target antigen. When release of the active form of the compound at the target site is desired, then the compound is attached to specific sites on an antibody molecule immunoglobulin belonging to a class that is capable of activating the complement cascade. This attachment is accomplished via chemical bonds The chemical linking methods described herein allow the resulting antibody conjugate to retain the ability to bind antigen and to activate the complement cascade. As a result, when the conjugate is administered to an individual, the subsequent formation of immune complexes with target antigens The method of the present invention offers another advantage over other targeting systems. It is known that all cells of a tumor do not each possess the target antigenic determinant. Thus, delivery systems which require internalization into the target cell will effect successful delivery only to those tumor cells that possess the antigenic determinant and that are capable of internalizing the complex. Tumor cells that do not possess the antigenic determinant or are incapable of internalization, will escape treatment. According to the method of the present invention, antibody carrier molecules deliver the compound to the target cells. More importantly, however, once attached to the target cell, the method described in the present invention allows the release of the active compound by the individual s activated complement enzymes. Once released, the compound is then free to permeate the target sites, The method of targeted delivery described herein may be employed for a number of purposes. The choice of antibodies, linkers, and compounds used to make the conjugates depends upon the purpose of delivery. The delivery and release of pharmaceutical compounds at specific target sites may result in selectively killing or preventing the proliferation of tumor cells, cancer cells, fungi, bacteria, parasites, or virus. The targeted delivery of hormones, enzymes, or neurotransmitters to selected sites may also be accomplished. Ultimately the method of the present invention may have an application in gene therapy programs wherein DNA or specific genes may be delivered In an alternate embodiment, the conjugate may be designed so that the compound is delivered to the target but not released. Thus, the present invention may also be used for locating, detecting, and quantitating specific sites Specifically, in the case of imaging, a radiopharmaceutical or heavy metal is a covalently bound to the linker or b non covalently bound to the linker via a chelator. Therefore, depending upon the nature of the target and purpose of delivery, a wide range of antibodies, linkers, and compounds of interest may be used in a variety of combinations. According to the method of the present invention, when release of a compound is desired, that compound is linked to a specific site on an antibody of the IgM class or certain subclasses of IgG FIG. 1 . The resulting conjugate retains the ability to bind antigen and activate the complement cascade. Complement is the collective name for a group of serum proteins which can be activated in one of two ways, the classical pathway and the properdin pathway Müller Eberhard, Hospital Practice, August 1977 33 43 . The classical pathway is initiated by the binding of antibodies of the IgM class or certain subclasses of IgG to its corresponding antigen whereas the properdin pathway is dependent upon the serum protein, properdin and other non immunoglobulin serum factors Reid and Porter, 1981, Ann. Rev. Biochem. The classical pathway is the pathway of particular importance for the practice of the present invention. The classical pathway is characterized by the formation of certain antibody antigen complexes or immune complexes which activate the proteolytic enzymes of the complement system Borsos and Rapp, 1965, J. Immunol. The first component activated in the classical pathway is C1 which becomes a protease that acts on both C2 and C4. Activated C1 C The enzymatic activities of both C Thus, according to the present invention, a compound is joined to one end of the substrate linker group and the other end of the linker group is attached to a specific site on the antibody molecule. For example, if the compound has an hydroxy group or an amino group, the compound may be attached to the carboxy terminus of a peptide, amino acid or other suitably chosen linker via an ester or amide bond, respectively. For example, such compounds may be attached to the linker peptide via a carbodiimide reaction. If the compound contains functional groups that would interfere with attachment to the linker, these interfering functional groups can be blocked before attachment of the compound and deblocked once the conjugate is made. For example, FIG. 3 depicts a general reaction scheme for the attachment of the antineoplastic drug, Alkeran Burroughs Wellcome to the peptide CBZ gly gly arg. The opposite or amino terminal of the linker group is then modified for binding to an antibody molecule which is capable of activating complement. The compound may be attached to the linker before or after the linker is attached to the antibody molecule. In certain applications such as attachment of short lived radioisotopes to antibodies, it is desirable to first produce a stable modified antibody as an intermediate wherein the linker is free of an associated compound. Depending upon the particular application, the compound may be covalently attached to the linker of the modified antibody. These peptide linkers may be variable in length since distance of the substrate from the antibody molecule may affect efficiency of cleavage which occurs at the amide or ester bond between the linker and the compound. These linkers may also include organic compounds, for example, organic polymers of any desired length, one end of which can be covalently attached to specific sites on the antibody molecule. The other end of the organic polymer may be attached to an amino acid or peptide linker. Table III lists other substrates that may be used as linker groups to prepare the antibody conjugates of the present invention. In the table n may be an integer including zero. These sequences were derived from those of the complement substrate sequences by substituting amino acids with similar acid base properties. This list is not exhaustive. Thus when these conjugates bind to antigen in the presence of complement the amide or ester bond which attaches the compound to the linker will be cleaved, resulting in release of the compound in its active form. These conjugates, when administered to an individual, will accomplish delivery and release of the compound at the target site, and are particularly effective for the In certain applications, release of the compound is Alternatively, a compound may be attached to antibody molecules or antibody fragments which do not activate complement. When using carrier antibodies that are incapable of complement activation, this attachment may be accomplished using linkers that are susceptible to cleavage by activated complement or using linkers that are not susceptible to cleavage by activated complement. This non cleavage approach is also particularly useful for making antibody conjugates for use in imaging systems for locating tumors, organs, sites of infection, etc., where release of the compound is In still another embodiment, it may be necessary to construct the linker in such a way as to optimize the spacing between the compound and the antibody. This may be accomplished by use of a linker of the general structure In yet another application of target delivery, a release of the compound without complement activation is desired since activation of the complement cascade will ultimately lyse the target cell. Hence, this approach is useful when delivery and release of the compound should be accomplished without killing the target cell. Such is the goal when delivery of cell mediators such as hormones, enzymes, corticosteroids, neurotransmitters, genes or enzymes to target cells is desired. These conjugates may be prepared by attaching the compound to an antibody molecule or fragment that is not capable of activating complement via a linker that is mildy susceptible to cleavage by serum proteases. When this conjugate is administered to an individual, antigen antibody complexes will form quickly whereas cleavage of the compound will occur slowly, thus resulting in release of the compound at the target site. The first steps in activation of the classical complement pathway require an interaction between C1 and antibody antigen complexes. This interaction requires that a site in the Fc region of the antibody molecule be present FIG. 1 . Some of the carbohydrate moieties are located on the Fc region of the immunoglobulin which are required in order for C1 binding to occur. Removal of the carbohydrate moiety results in loss of the ability of the immune complex to bind component C1 of complement Winkelhake In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, the substrate linkers are modified by attaching hydrazine or hydrazide deriviatives to one end of the linker. The unmodified sites on the linker may or may not be covalently attached to a compound. For instance, the substrate linkers which are attached to a compound via an ester or amide link, as described in Section 5.5 see Table II and Table III are modified by attaching a hydrazide Although in the structure shown the hydrazine is in the para position, one could alternatively use compounds with the hydrazine moiety in the ortho or meta positions. These hydrazide derivatives of the peptide linkers which are attached to a compound via an ester or amide link are then reacted with an oxidized immunoglobulin, or immunoglobulin fragment containing an oxidized carbohydrate. This results in hydrazone formation and the covalent attachment of the compound to the carbohydrate side chain of the immunoglobulin via a linker group which is susceptible to cleavage by complement. If desired, the linker utilized may be resistant to cleavage by either activated complement or serum proteases Although this section is directed primarily to reactions with the carbohydrate moieties of antibodies, such techniques are applicable to other classes of glycoproteins as well. The antibody conjugates of the invention are useful for a variety of applications in medicine and industry, including diagnostics and therapeutics. All of these applications capitalize on the ability of antibodies to distinguish specifically between chemical compounds of slightly differing structure. The following examples illustrate methods for the specific attachment of an antibody molecule to a compound of interest via an intermediate soluble linker. The antibody molecule used in this example was a monoclonal IgM designated no. 171 specific for antigenic determinants on sheep red blood cells. To prepare the monoclonal antibody, Lewis rats were immunized with a single injection of sheep red blood cells. Three days later, spleen cells from the immunized rats were harvested and fused with the myeloma line SP2 0 Ag14 according to the method of McKearn, Oxidation of the antibody carbohydrate moiety was accomplished by reacting the antibody with galactose oxidase by a modification of the method of Cooper, For the purposes of the present example, a synthetic fluorogenic compound was utilized as the conjugate partner. The properties of this synthetic compound are such that the bound and free states of the fluorogenic compound are spectrofluorometrically distinguishable. The synthetic fluorogenic compound used was obtained from Serva Fine Biochemicals, Inc., Garden City Park, L.I., N.Y. Catalog 51474 . This compound consists of a tripeptide Gly Gly Arg attached via an amide linkage to the fluorescent compound 7 amino 4 methyl coumarin AMC the amino group of glycine is blocked by carbobenzoxy chloride Cbz . The structure of this compound herein called Tripeptide AMC is shown below The excitation and emission maxima of free AMC 345 nm and 445 nm, respectively differ from those for AMC bound to the tripeptide 325 nm and 395 nm, respectively . This affords a means for distinguishing between the bound and free forms of the AMC molecule using a fluorometric assay. Excitation and emission wavelengths of 383 nm and 455 nm may be used for optimum differences for assay purposes at these wavelengths, free AMC retains 20 of its maximal fluorescence but possesses a relative fluorescence 500 fold greater than an equimolar amount of bound AMC Zimmerman, In order to effect specific bonding of the Tripeptide AMC to the oxidized carbohydrate moiety of the antibody prepared in Section 6.1, a hydrazine derivative was linked to the terminal glycine of the Tripeptide AMC compound. The presence of the hydrazine group is advantageous since this results in reactivity for the oxidized carbohydrate moiety of the antibody molecule under very mild conditions while not affecting the antigen binding site. Aldehyde groups of the oxidized carbohydrate side chain of the antibody molecule then react with the hydrazine derivative to form a hydrazone. In order to attach a hydrazine derivative This compound was shown to be positive for fluorescence by exciting with ultraviolet light, and positive for the presence of a hydrazine group. The hydrazine linked to the tripeptide was detected by thin layer chromatography TLC using a spray of a 0.1 trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid aqueous solution for the colorimetric determination of a hydrazine a pinkish or orange brown color indicates the presence of hydrazine . The results of TLC demonstrated the presence of a hydrazine group at the migratory band of the Tripeptide AMC. The absorption and emission spectra for the Phenylhydrazine Tripeptide AMC compound as shown in FIG. 5 reveal a similarity to the Tripeptide AMC spectra but a shift in excitation and emission maxima consistent with the covalent modification of the Tripeptide AMC. The maxima for excitation and emission of the Phenylhydrazine Tripeptide AMC compound are 345 nm and 385 nm, respectively. The product was precipitated from solution with cold diethyl ether, washed, and dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide Baker Chemical Co., Phillipsburg, N.J. , The oxidized monoclonal antibody preparation, described in Section 6.1, Spectrofluorometric analysis of the protein fractions confirmed the presence of the Phenylhydrazine Tripeptide AMC covalently attached to the antibody now called Antibody Phenylhydrazine Tripeptide AMC, or antibody conjugate . The excitation and emission maxima for the conjugate are 325 nm and 385 nm, respectively FIG. 6 . The large peak at 285 nm in the excitation spectrum of the conjugate may be explained by tryptophan absorption with residual fluorescence at 385 nm and may also be the result of resonance energy transfer from the amino acid tryptophan of the antibody molecule to AMC. The purpose of this series of examples is to demonstrate that methods for preparing antibody conjugates of the invention do not adversely affect the antigen binding properties of antibodies in the way the carbodimide reaction affects such properties. To this end, the carbohydrate of a mouse monoclonal IgM, specific for the phosphorylcholine group, was oxidized and covalently attached to the 1,6 diaminohexyl derivative of ethylene diamine di o hydroxyphenylacetic acid EDDHA to form 1,6 diaminohexyl EDDHA. For comparative purposes, 1,6 diaminohexyl EDDHA as well as unmodified EDDHA were attached to identical samples of the IgM monoclonal antibody using the carbodiimide reaction. Under these conditions, the 1,6 diaminohexyl EDDHA would couple to available aspartic and glutamic acid residues, while the unmodified EDDHA would couple to available lysines. The binding properties of these samples were compared with the native antibody in order to evaluate affinity and homogeneity. A mouse monoclonal IgM antibody specific for the ligand, phosphorylcholine, was oxidized at a concentration of 2 mg mℓ in phosphate buffered saline PBS, 0.01M phosphate, 0.15M sodium chloride , pH 7.0. The antibody containing solution was cooled in a water ice bath, and 56.8 µg of sodium metaperiodate was added 40 µℓ of a 1.42 mg mℓ solution final periodate concentration 0.26mM . This reaction mixture was incubated for one hour, after which 2 µℓ of ethylene glycol was added. This was incubated an additional thirty minutes. The sample was then passed through a Sephadex G 25 column equilibrated with PBS and the protein fractions pooled. EDDHA 1.5 g, 4.2 mmole and triethylamine 1.2 mℓ, 8.4 mmole were mixed with 40 mℓ of water. This heterogeneous solution was heated to 60 C and stirred vigorously for 0.5 hour. The solution was dried 1 amino 6 trifluoroacetamidohexane 0.8 g, 4.1 mmole was added to the above carboxycarbonic anhydride of EDDHA. The homogeneous solution was stirred at 4 C for 0.5 hour, then was lyophilized to yield an oily product. The oil was washed with acetone ether 4 1 mixture to yield a crude yellow product. The solid 1 amino 6 trifluoroacetamidohexyl EDDHA was collected and hydrolyzed with 7 K₂CO₃ and reprecipitated with HCl at pH 4 to yield pure 1,6 diaminohexyl EDDHA 1.4 g . This compound gives a positive test of ninhydrin and thin layer chromatography shows only one spot. In the presence of basic solution of an equal molar quantity of TbCl₃, excitation at 295 nm yielded emission at 545 nm, due to formation of the characteristic energy transfer chelate complex between EDDHA and terbium ion. The antibody, oxidized by the method of Section 7.1, was incubated with an approximately 270 fold molar excess of 1,6 diaminohexyl EDDHA, prepared by the method of Section 7.2, for one hour at room temperature. This was followed by addition of solid sodium cyanoborohydride to a final concentration of 10mM, and further incubation of 4 hours at room temperature. The mixture was then dialyzed at 4 C versus several changes of PBS, and concentrated by ultrafiltration. To 263 µℓ IgM antibody 1.9 mg mℓ was added 10 mg of 1 ethyl 3 3 dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide 1 mℓ of 10 mg mℓ solution, pH 5.0 and PBS pH 5.0 to make up to 2.5 mℓ. The mixture was incubated for two hours at room temperature. Then 275 µℓ of 0.1M 1,6 diaminohexyl EDDHA in 2.5 mℓ water pH 5.5 was added and the solution incubated two hours at room temperature. Ten µl of 1M ethanolamine was then added and incubated for one hour at room temperature. This was then dialysed overnight against PBS pH 7.0 . To 263 µℓ IgM antibody 1.9 mg mℓ was added 10 mg of 1 ethyl 3 3 dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide 1 mℓ of 10 mg mℓ solution, pH 5.0 and PBS pR 5.0 to make up to 2.5 mℓ. The mixture was incubated for two hours at room temperature. To this was added 2.75 mℓ of 0.01M EDDHA pH 5.5 and the solution was incubated for two hours at room temperature. Ten µℓ 1M ethanolamine was added and the mixture incubated for one hour at room temperature. This was then dialysed overnight against PBS pH 7.0 . The affinities of unmodified mouse monoclonal antibody and antibody conjugates prepared according to Sections 7.3, 7.4 and 7.5, all specific for the phosphorylcholine group, were measured by fluozescence quenching using a Perkin Elmin Model 512 Double Beam Fluorescence Spectrometer Perkin Elmer Corporation, Norwalk, Connecticut . The excitation and emission wavelengths were 295 and 345 nm, respectively, and the temperature was maintained at 25 C with a Lauda K 2 R circulating water both Brinkmann Instruments . and ranged from 7.5 x 10 ⁸ to 9.7 x 10 ⁸ M. All binding sites were assumed to be active and the sample volumes were 3.0 mℓ. The stock concentrations of the ligand, N 2,4 dinitrophenyl The calculation of the Q The Sips plots presenting data for unmodified antibody carbodiimide conjugates and antibody conjugates of the invention are shown in FIG. 7. The binding measurements clearly demonstrate the retention of specificity, affinity, and homogeneity for the sample modified via the carbohydrate attachment methods of the invention when compared to the unmodified antibody The association constant for the binding of the phosphorylcholine derivative was measured to be 0.1 x 10⁵ M ¹ for the unmodified antibody and 1.1 x 10⁶ M ¹ for the carbohydrate attached antibody conjugate. In contrast to this, an antibody preparation modified by the carbodiimide reaction has substantially reduced binding, certainly well below the calculated values of 1 2 x 10⁵. The assumption of a heterogeneity index of unity in the Sips analysis is valid for the data reduction The following examples illustrate a method for the specific attachment to an antibody molecule of a peptide linked to a compound of interest compound via an amide or ester bond. The resulting antibody conjugate retains the ability to fix complement as revealed by a hemolytic complement fixation assay. Furthermore, the specific release of the compound at the antigenic cell surface via enzymatic cleavage by the complement system is demonstrated by a non hemolytic assay. In the following examples the compound is fluorogenic. Thus, the complement mediated release of the fluorescent compound may be detected by an assay capable of differentiating between the bound and free forms of the fluorescent molecule. The materials and procedures of Section 6.1 were used as described to oxidize the carbohydrate moieties of monoclonal antibodies No. 171 . In the presence of sheep red blood cells and serum complement, these monoclonal antibodies No. 171 activate the complement enzyme cascade a result of antigen antibody binding . Complement fixation causes lysis of the sheep red blood cells which results in the release of hemoglobin. The released hemoglobin may be detected spectrophotometrically, thus providing an assay for complement fixation. The tripeptide AMC was prepared as described in Section 6.2. The properties of the fluorogenic compound AMC are such that the bound and free states of the fluorogenic compound are spectrofluorometrically distinguishable. This provides a definitive assay for measuring the complement fixation ability of the antibody conjugate. More importantly, it provides a means for quantitating the subsequent complement mediated release of the compound. The specific covalent attachment of Phenylhydrazine tripeptide AMC to the oxidized carbohydrate moieties of the antibodies was performed as described in Section 6.3. Two types of complement fixation assays were utilized, hemolytic and fluorometric. These assays determined whether the Antibody Phenylhydrazine Tripeptide AMC conjugate retained complement fixation ability, and whether AMC was cleaved by complement. A 10 mℓ sample of freshly drawn human whole blood was clotted on ice for 17 hours. The clot was removed by centrifugation, and the resulting human serum was frozen in 0.5 mℓ aliquots. Human complement was shown to be active in these samples by the hemolytic assay described in Section 8.1.2. A 200 µℓ aliquot of a suspension of sheep red blood cells Gibco Diagnostics, Madison, Wis. at an approximate concentration of 2 x 10⁸ cells mℓ were mixed with 20 µℓ of the antibody conjugate mixture prepared in Section 6.3 approximately 2 µg of protein . After 15 minutes of mixing and incubating at 37 C, 100 µℓ of the human serum complement prepared in Section 8.1.1 was added to the mixture. After 30 min to 1 hour of incubation at 37 C, the mixture was centrifuged to pellet the cells. The extent of complement mediated cell lysis was determined by spectrophotometrically measuring hemoglobin released into the supernatant 412 nm . The results of this assay demonstrated complete hemolysis and essentially 100 binding of antibody to cell surface. For example, addition of distilled water to a pellet formed by centrifuging 200 µℓ of the sheep red blood cell suspension completely lyses the cells, and releases hemoglobin. A 1 20 dilution of the supernatant of sheep red blood cells which were completely lysed in distilled water had an O.D.₄₁₂ of 0.646. An identical dilution of sheep red blood cells which were lysed by the addition of conjugate and complement had an O.D.₄₁₂ of 0.672. Thus the conjugate retained the ability to bind antigen and to fix complement. Conditions for the non hemolytic assay were identical to those above except that glutaraldehyde fixed sheep red blood cells Sigma, St. Louis, Mo. were used in place of normal sheep red blood cells. Glutaraldehyde fixed cells do not lyse in the presence of antibody and complement and, therefore, no hemoglobin is released. Instead, a fluorometric assay is used to demonstrate the release of the AMC. A non hemolytic system is necessary for use in the fluorometric assay, because the presence of hemoglobin interferes with fluorescence measurements in this system. Prior to use in the assay, these fixed red blood cells were shown to bind both the unmodified antibody and the Atbody Phenylhydrazine Tripeptide AMC which was prepared in Section 6.3. The non hemolytic assay was used to show the specific complement mediated release of the AMC from the antibody conjugate. Similarly to the hemolytic assay, 200 µℓ of the glutaraldehyde fixed sheep red blood cells, at an approximate concentration of 2 x 10⁸ cells mℓ, was incubated with the Antibody Phenylhydrazide Tripeptide AMC conjugate at 37 C for 15 minutes. After centrifuging and resuspension in buffer, 50 µℓ of the human complement preparation Section 8.1.1 was added, and the fluorescense at 460 nm monitored, with excitation at 380 nm Caporale,
