## Description
SPECIFICATIONWHEEL TRIM This invention relates to wheel trims for embellishing the road wheels of vehicles such as cars. Car owners often like to improve the appearance of their cars and usually start by improving the look of the road wheels. At present not much can be doe to inprove the appe1rance of conventional wheels of pressed steel except to change their colour witn paint or to fit custom made wheel trims.However, the appearance of a re painted wheel quick ly deteriorates as the paint becomes chipped and scratched. Custom made wheel trims are a problem for all concerned. The manufacturer has to produce a wheel trim for each size of wheel. Because each packaged wheel trim set will take up a lot of space, the manufacturer must have a large storage area to accommodate a full range of sizes, and much space is involved in transportation. The retailer also suffers from the problem of storage of a full range of sizes. As an alternative to re pai lting or fitting custom made wheel trims, one can fit wheels which have been cast, for example of an all nium magnes ium alloy. Such wheels are vera7 expensive and, although they are usually highly polished to start with, they soon become tarnished and encrusted with corrosion. It is also possible, as disclosed in BritishPatent Specification No. 848716, to fit a combined tyre trim viheel trim tn a vehicle wheel. In Gis case, the wheel trim er s to mount the tyre trim and is secured to the lip of the wheel rim by means of a plurality of clips. An object of the invention is to provide a wheel trim which can be fitted to any size of vehicle wheel, so as to embellish the wheel, and which can be fitted in a very simple and convenient manner by the vehicle owner, without the use of special tools or skill. Pursuant hereto, the present invention proviaes a wheel trim comprising a strip of substantially Lshaped cross section and joining means joining free ends of the strip together to form an annulus characterised in that the upright of the L is shaped so as to directly interfit with the rim of a vehicle wheel, within a circular space defined by the rim, to embellish the wheel. The strip is preferably a metal foil coated in a plastics material. The joining means may conveniently be a clip of substantially L shaped cross section, and this clip may have lips on the free ends of the upright and foot of the X for engaging around the strip. Then, the clip may be crimped onto the free ends of the strip. Bor contributing to the security of fitting of the wheel trim to a wheel rim adhesive may be provided on the upright of the L shaped strip.This adhesive may be, for instance, in the form of adhesive blobs or a self adhesive band, e.g.of extruded foam, about a quarter of an inch wide,Such a band may have a protective wrapping covering the adhesive, this wrapping being removed before the wheel trim is fitted to its wheel, when the self adhesive band will serve to hold the trim in place. Alternatively, or in addition to the adhesive, the strip may have formations, preferably resilient, which serve to resist removal of the trim from the wheel or reduce slack between the trim and the wheel. The wheel trim of the invention may be sold as a kit comprising a strip and joining means in the form of a clip. The invention also provides, as a further feature thereof, a method of making a wheel trim comprising a strip of substantially L shaped crosssection and joining means, which comprises joining free ends of the strip together by the joining means to form an annulus which will interfit the rim of a vehicle wheel to embellish the wheel. The invention will be described further, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawing in which Fig. 1 is a perspective view illustrating the components of a preferred embodiment of the wheel trim of the invention Fig. 2 is a perspective view illustrating the components of Fig. 1 assembled to form the wheel trim, to a reduced scale compared with Fig. 1 Fig. 3 is an enlarged radial section through part of a wheel illustrating the wheel trim ofFig. 2 fitted in place Fig. 4 is a section comparable with part ofFig. 3, but to a further enlarged scale, and illustrating a second embodiment of the wheel trim of the invention and Fig. 5 is a view similar to Fig. 4 illustrating a third embodiment. The preferred embodiment of the wheel trim of the invention illustrated in Figs. 1 to 3 comprises a strip 10 of substantially L shaped cross section and, as joining means, a clip 15. The strip 10 has a broad portion 11 corresponding to the upright of the L and a foot portion 12 corresponding to the foot of the L. The strip 10 comprises a metal foil 13 ooated with a plastics material 14, e.g. by extrusion. The clip 15 is made of aluminium or like metal or alloy, which may be crimped, and comprises a substantially L shaped body 16 having lips 18 at the free ends of the upright and foot of the L. Defined between the lips 18 and the clip body 16 are grooves 19 which can accept the free ends of the strip 10.The arrangement of the lips 18 is readily discernable from Fig. 1. When the free ends of the strip 10 are located in the clip 15 they form an annulus 20, as illustrated in Fig. 2. The annulus 20 may be fitted into a wheel 21, as illustrated in Fig. 3, the wheel comprising a body 22 having a rim 23 and a tyre 24. The wheel trim is assembled in the following manner. The free ends of the strip 10 are joined together by being pushed into the clip 15 and are retained by the lips 18 of the clip 15, with the foot portion 12 of the strip 10 projecting outwardly from the axis of the annulus 20 formed by the strip 10 and the clip 15. The annulus 20 is now off ered up to the wheel it is required to fit. If the annulus 20 is too large to fit inside the wheel rim 23, one end of the strip 10 can be taken out of the clip 15 and a short length cut off the strip 10. The step, of offering up the annulus 20 to the wheel 21 and then cutting off some of the strip are repeated until the annulus 20 will fit tightly into the wheel rim 23. When the correct fit has been achieved, the clip 15 is crimped tightly onto the free ends of the strip 10, making the wheel trim a permanent annulus 20. The wheel trim is then pushed home inside the wheel rim 23 as illustrated in Fig. 3 where it embellishes the wheel 21. To achieve an effective fit of the wheel trim, with the wheel rim 23, the strip 10 should be cut to exactly the right size as discussed above, otherwise adjuttments e.g. the introduction of a spacer between the facing ends of the strip, 10 within the clip 15 may be necessary. The accuracy needed for fitting the strip 10 can be reduced somewhat by use of a modified strip configuration, such as is illustrated in Fig. 4 or by providing for the strip to be adhered in place, as is illustrated in Fig. 5. In the embodiment of Fig. 4 the broad portion 11 of the strip 10 has formations which serve to engage with the wheel rim 23 and resist separation or removal of the trim. These formations are in the form of integrally moulded saw tooth shaped ribs or pro trusions 25 which extend all the way around the annulus formed by the strip 10. These ribs or protrusions 25 will yield at least to a small extent when the trim is fitted to the wheel. A modification of the embodiment shown inFig. 4 may have protrusions 25 which are larger and more resilient than those shown in Fig. 4 and which serve to reduce slack between the wheel trim and the wheel. In the embodiment of Fig. 5 adhesive, in the form of blobs 26 is provided to secure the wheel trim in place. The blobs 26 may be applied either to the wheel rim or, more preferably, to the broad portion 11 of the strip 10. The blobs 26 act not only as adhesive, but also as a partially deformable packing material between the trim and the rim 23. In another embodiment not shown , the strip 10 has, along the majority of the broad portion 11 of its length, a self adhesive band of extruded plastics foam. This self adhesive band, which is about a quarter of an inch wide, has adhesive on two opposing surfaces. The adhesive can be applied to the self adhesive as a continuous film or dis crete blobs or by a doctor blade technique. The adhesive on one side of the self adhesive band secure the self adhesive band to the strip 10.The adhesive on the other side of the self adhesive band is covered by a protective wrapping which is removed before fitting the trim to its wheel. The wheel trim of the invention is not limited to the above described embodiments. The strip can be all metal or all plastics, and, if it is wholly plastics, the joining means can be an adhesive. The advantages of a wheel trim of the present invention over conventional wheel trims are innumerable. It is, easy to fit to any size of vehicle wheel the only tools needed are tools to cut the strip, such as a strong pair of scissors, and a tool for crimping the clip if a clip provides the joining means . Because the wheel trim comes in only one size and only takes up a small amount of space, the costs of manufacture and distribution are kept low, thereby providing the wheel trim as an inexpensive accessory for the vehicle owner who wishes to embellish the wheels of his vehicle.
