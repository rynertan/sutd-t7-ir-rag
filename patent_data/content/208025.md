# Flow metering device.

## Abstract
In a combine harvester 1 having a clean grain conveyor 12 , a clean grain weight rate metering device 21 is provided generally at the discharge end 30 of said conveyor 12 . The weight rate metering device 21 comprises a sensor member 51 disposed to be acted upon by the clean grain flow as it issues from the clean grain conveyor 12 , and a transducer 52 operatively associated with the sensor member 51 to continuously generate a signal proportional to the clean grain weight rate. The sensor member 51 is curved in shape and is operatively disposed generally in the path of the clean grain flow issueing from the conveyor 12 for deflecting the direction of movement of the clean grain flow and for guiding said flow therealong while subjecting the sensor member to a centrifugal force. The inventive concept also may be used in a flow metering device for metering the weight rate of any type of materials flow and generally always comprises conditioning means 32 65, 67 102 forwardly of the sensor member 51 103 for concentrating, in a coherent stream, all the material of the materials flow and for transferring said coherent stream to the sensor member 51 103 for guiding said coherent stream in permanent contact with the sensor surface 55 105 as it is moved through the sensor member 51 103 .
