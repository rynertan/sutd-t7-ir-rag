# CATALYTIC PURIFICATION OF EXHAUST GAS OF INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE USING LEAN MIXTURE

## Abstract
A method of decreasing HC and CO contained in exhaust gas of an internal combustion engine, particularly an automo tive gasoline engine, operated with a very lean mixture by contact of the exhaust gas in hot state with a monolithic catalyst comprising a monolithic carrier, which is provided with an active alumina base coating containing Ce or La in oxide form, and metallic Pd and or Pt deposited on the coat ing. The total content of Pd and or Pt in the catalyst is limited within the range from 0.043 to 0.43 wt . It is suitable to form the coating by treating the monolithic carrier with a slurry containing a mixture of an active alumina powder containing 1 5 wt of Ce or La and a powder of CeO₂ or La₂O₃ and baking the treated carrier, adjusting the amount of the ceria or lanth ana powder such that Ce or La of this powder amounts to 5 50 wt of the coating after baking. Despite the use of a relatively small quantity of the noble metal, high conversions of HC and CO are achieved even at relatively low exhaust gas tempera tures.
