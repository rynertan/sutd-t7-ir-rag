# AN IMPROVED ELECTRIC ARC WELDING TOOL

## Abstract
A vibrating electrode electric arc welding tool for low currents particularly for use on thin gauge metal has a so lenoid with a fixed core and a moving core spaced therefrom by an air gap. The moving core holds the electrode and the solenoid winding is in series connection with the current feed to the electrode. When the current increases due to contact between the electrode and work the moving core is attracted to the fixed core to break the connection and re establish the arc. The tool further includes a diode in series with the current feed, the diode provides better control of the arc and enables lighter gauge metals to be welded.
