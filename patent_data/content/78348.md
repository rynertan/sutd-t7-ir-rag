# A device for tilting a vehicle cabin from and into the drive position.

## Abstract
This device comprises at least one double acting hy draulic piston cylinder device 1, 1 in a circuit together with a pump 9 , a fluid reservoir 10 and a control valve 8, 8 . Both ends of the piston cylinder device 1, 1 are pivotally connected to the vehicle cabin and the vehicle chassis respectively. A locking means locks the cabin in the drive position and is controlled by a valve 17, 17 in the hydraulic circuit. This valve is adapted to unlock the locking means under the influence of a pressure in the circuit which is below the pressure valve necessary for actuating the cabin tilting device 1, 1 and to bent the circuit to the reservoir 10 if the pressure exceeds that pressure value. Thereby damage to the system due to overpressure is prevented which overpressure might otherwise occur when the locking means blocks.
