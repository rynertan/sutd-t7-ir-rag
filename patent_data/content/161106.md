# A BRACKET AND POST ASSEMBLY

## Abstract
A bracket and post assembly suitably for shopfitting pro vides means for supporting a shelf by means of a single post 30 and a cantilever bracket 31. The post and bracket are en gageable by complementary interfitting means. On the post there are alternate vertically spaced outer and inner supports 33, 4 in the form of angled pieces, being formed by pressing outwardly to greater or lesser extents from a single sheet. The bracket has diverging arms 45 and at its root region a pair of slots, one in each arm, shaped to provide a hook at its root. An outer support 33 is received in the bracket slots and the bracket is hooked thereto. The bracket is supported above and below by respectively the outer and inner supports acting as buttresses against the cantilever forces. The assem bly is particularly secure against the peeling effect of a load and resistant to rattling or looseness.
