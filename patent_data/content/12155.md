# Intruder alarm device.

## Abstract
The intruder alarm device 100 includes a housing mounting a keyboard 112 on which the outside thereof and a loudspeaker 750 and electric components within the housing. The housing is adapted for mounting on a door or door frame adjacent a magnet mounted on the door frame or door. The device includes an audio alarm circuit 320 including the loudspeaker for generating an audio alarm when the door is opened, a control circuit 340 coupled to the alarm circuit for controlling operation of the alarm circuit, a signal generating circuitry including door motion sensing logic 440 for sensing when the door has been opened and for generating an alarm signal which is applied to the control circuit for operating the alarm circuit. The device further includes a programmable alarm inhibiting circuit including the keyboard upon which a number can be keyed in through switches closed by the keys for inhibiting operation of the audio alarm circuit. The alarm inhibiting circuit includes keyboard decoding logic und three leads which are coupled to the keyboard de coding logic 460 and which are releasably connected to one side of the switches operated by the keys on the key board. The keyboard forms a means for presenting a num ber to the keyboard decoding logic which compares the presented number with the predetermined number as de fined by the number switches to which the three leads are connected. The keyboard decoding logic is designed so that when the number presented to the keyboard is pre sented in a proper timed sequence and corresponds with the predetermined number stored, as defined by the selected connections of the three leads to the key switches, an alarm inhibit signal is produced by the keyboard decoding logic which is supplied to the control circuit for inhibiting or stopping the control circuit from operating the audio alarm circuit. The device also may include a bird chirp circuit 330 for providing a bird chirping sound to announce when a visitor has opened the door.
