# Method for using a charge coupled device as a peak detector.

## Abstract
A charge coupled device CCD with separately address able input signal gates is operated in the potential equil brium mode. With properly selected voltage potentials the CCD can be used as a high speed linear detector of a variable analog signal without the need of preceeding independent sample and hold or peak detector circuits. The result is the efficient minimum maximum detection of an analog signal in a fast in slow out digitizer.
