# PNP output short circuit protection.

## Abstract
A limit is placed upon the maximum collector current available from a common emitter transistor Q7 in the driver stage of an amplifier provided with overall feedback from its output stage following the driver stage to its input stage preced ing the driver stage. This limit is imposed by saturation of a transistor Q4 in the input stage, which is of complementary conductivity type to the common emitter transistor and which applies its collector current as base current to the common emitter transistor, limiting the voltage applied to its base cir cuit. The common emitter transistor in the driver stage is pro vided with emitter degeneration resistance R1 , so limiting the voltage applied to its base circuit results in limiting the drive capability of the driver stage. This prevents the overall feedback increasing the output current of the driver stage so much it interferes with restriction of the base current drive whenever a tendency towards overly large current flow through the output transistor Q11 is sensed R3, Q13 . This forestalls increased dissipation in the output transistor Q11 that might damage or destroy it.
