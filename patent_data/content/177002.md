# Roller mounting arrangement, in roller conveyors and roller tables in general.

## Abstract
A roller mounting arrangement, particularly on a roller conveyor or roller table, in which each roller comprises a cylindrical body 7 mounted rotatable on a fixed axial shaft or pin, the ends 5, 6 of which are mounted on a support frame. At least one of the ends of said pin, projecting from the end of the cylindrical body 7 , has a non circular cross section arranged to fit exactly into a correspondingly shaped hole 3, 4 in the support frame, a clip spacer 8 being radially fitted over at least one of said ends 5, 6 of the central pin.

## Claims

## Description
ROLLER MOUNTING ARRANGEMENT, IN ROLLER CONVEYORS AND ROLLERTABLES IN GENERAL 0 In constructing roller conveyors or roller tables in general, mounting the rollers on the respective support frame is a known problem. Normally, for these applications, the rollers consist of elongated cylindrical bodies mounted rotatable by way of bearings on fixed pins or shafts, the ends of which emerge from the ends of the cylindrical bodies and are fixed on to the support frame by various techniques. In a known arrangement, holes for housing the ends of the pins or shafts are provided in the two opposing sidepieces of the frame at regular intervals and with the distance between their axes slightly greater than the diameter of the cylindrical bodies, and supplementary means are also provided for locking these ends into said holes. The object of the present invention is to provide a mounting arrangement for these rollers, which is of extreme constructional simplicity, allows easy roller fitting, and is of low cost. This result is attained in that at least one end of the pin or shaft, projecting from the end of the cylindrical body, has a non circular cross section, in particular polygonal, for example square or hexagonal, or merely comprising a flattened zone, and arranged to fit exactly into a correspondingly shaped hole in the support frame, and in that a spacer in the form of a clip is radially fitted over at least one end of the central pin after the roller has been mounted in its seat. Further characteristics and advantages of the arrangement according to the invention will be apparent from the description of a preferred embodiment thereof given hereinafter and illustrated by way of example on the accompanying drawings, in which Fig.1 is a partly sectional side view of a roller mounted on the respective frame using the arrangement according to the invention Figs. 2 and 3 are views similar to that of Fig. 1, showing the roller while being mounted and Fig. 4 is a diagrammatic section through the line IV IV ofFig. 1. As shown in Fig. 1, the two sidepieces 1, 2 of the support frame comprise holes 3, 4 for receiving the support shaft ends 5 and 6 respectively, which emerge from the opposite ends of the cylindrical body 7 of the roller. The end 5 is preferably cylindrical and elongated, whereas the end 6 is for example hexagonal and projects from a widened part 6a of the shaft, forming a shoulder. The hexagonal shape of the end 6 is not however binding, as in practice it is sufficient for the end 6 to be of non circular cross section, for example square or generally polygonal, or even merely comprising a flattened zone, so as to fit into the correspondingly shaped hole 4 without possibility of rotation. Such a roller is mounted as follows. Firstly, the end 5 is inserted into the hole 3 in the frame sidepieces 1 by sliding the roller in the direction indicated by the arrow F, while keeping the end 6 temporarily raised above the sidepiece 2 see fig. 2 .Then, by pivoting the already inserted end 5, the end 6 is tilted to the inside of the sidepiece 2 see fig. 3 in front of the hole 4, this being allowed by the fact that the end 5 is thoroughly inserted into the hole 3. Finally, the end 6 is inserted into the hole 4 until the shoulder of the widened part 6a is brought against the wall of the sidepiece 2 see fig. 1 . When in this position, rotation of the axial pin is prevented by the exact fit of the hexagonal end 6 into the hexagonal hole 4. To prevent moreover the roller from sliding axially in the opposite direction to that in which it was inserted into position, a spacer in the form of a clip 8 is mounted over the end 5 in the space between the sidepiece 1 and the opposing end of the cylinder 7. The clip 8 can be constructed for example by moulding plastic material, as shown in fig. 4, or by suitably bending a metal band into a shape which enables it to be mounted over the end 5 by simple snap fitting. In this respect, it performs no other function than that of a spacer, and is therefore not subjected to stresses which could damage it or expel it from its position. It is apparent that the arrangement according to the present invention allows the rollers to be very simply and rapidly mounted, using means which are of very low cost, and practically without any tools.
