# Wire electrode spark erosion.

## Abstract
Hardmetal lamina 15 are cut, by a process known as electrical discharge machining, from a block of hardmetal 10 using a wire electrode 12 . The laminae so formed may then be attached by adhesive or epoxy resin to a suitable base 16 in order to form a hard metal surfaced tool. Provision is made for preventing this hardmetal from shearing from its mounting, and also to remove any heat generated within the hardmetal. Reference is made especial ly to using the above construction for a slipper within a tile producing machine. The word hardmetal is used to denote powdered carbides of the transition metals, cemented into solid masses by a matrix of a metal of a lower melting point.
