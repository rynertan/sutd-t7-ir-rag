Referring to the above formula I , the halogen represented by R1 and R2 includes, for example, chlorine, bromine, iodine and fluorine, the lower alkyl represented by R1 and R2 includes, for example, alkyl having 1 to 4 carbon atoms e.g. methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl or tert butyl , the lower alkyloxy represented by R1 and R2 includes, for example, alkyloxy having 1 to 4 carbon atoms e.g. methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, isopropoxy, butoxy or isobutoxy , the aralkyloxy group represented by R and R2 includes, for example, aralkyloxy having 7 to 9 carbon atoms e.g. benzyloxy, phenethyloxy, a methylbenzyloxy and. the lower alkylenedioxy formed by linkingR1 and R2 includes alkylenedioxy having 1 to 4 carbon atoms e.g. methylenedioxy, ethylenedioxy, ethylidenedioxy, isopropylidenedioxy and the like. The lower alkyl represented by R3, R4, R5 and R8 includes the same lower alkyl groups as those represented by R1 and R2. The acyl represented by R6 and R7 includes, for example, an acyl derived from a carboxylic acid such as lower alkanoyl having 2 to 4 carbon atoms e.g., acetyl, propionyl, butyryl, isobutyryl , aroyl e.g., benzoyl and the like.The acyl represented by R8 includes the same lower alkanoyl groups as those represented by R6 and R7. Further, when R6 and R7 jointly represent a single bond, the compound I is represented by a compound having a dithiolan ring of the formula EMI2.1 wherein all symbols are as defined above. In the compounds of the present invention,. preferred embodiment are compounds of the formula I wherein R1 and R2 independently represent hydrogen, halogen, C alkyl, 1 and R2 hydroxyl, 1 4 yinxy or C7 garalkyloxy, or R and R jointly represent C 1 4 alkylenedioxy R3 and R4 inde pendently represent hydrogen or C1 4 alkyl R is hydrogen,C1 4 alkyl or CH2SR7 wherein R7 is hydrogen, C2 4 alkanoyl or benzoyl R6 is hydrogen, C2 4 alkanoyl or benzoyl, or R6 and R7 jointly represent a single bond X is CH, , O orEMI3.1 wherein R8 is hydrogen, C2 4alkanoyl or C14alkyl and n is 2, 3 or 4, and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts. The compounds I of the present invention can be produced by, for example, reacting a compound of the formula EMI3.2 wherein all the symbols are as defined above d with a compound represented by the formula EMI3.3 wherein R5 and R6 are as defined abovel or a reactive derivative thereof at the carboxyl function. The reactive derivative of the compound III at the carboxyl function used in the above reaction between the compounds II and III includes a derivative, for example, an acid halide such as acid chloride, acid bromide and the like, an acid anhydride obtained by dehydrating one molecule of water from two molecules of the compound III , a mixed anhydride of the compound m wherein the hydrogen atom of carboxyl is substituted with, for example, ethoxycarbonyl, isobutoxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, etc. The reaction can be generally carried out in a suitable solvent and any solvent can be used so long as it does not adversely affect the reaction. When the compound m is used per se without converting into its reactive derivative, the reaction is advantageously conducted in the presence of a dehydrating agent, for example, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, carbonyldiimidazole and the like.When an acid halide is used as said reactive derivative, the reaction can also be conducted in the presence of a base such as pyridine, picoline, triethylamine, sodium hydroxide, sodium bicarbonate, sodium carbonate, etc. The reaction can be generally carried out at a temperature in the range of from about 200C to about 1500C and in most instances, it proceeds sufficiently at ambient temperature. The compound of the formula I wherein R6 and or R7 is hydrogen can also be prepared by hydrolyzing the compound I wherein R6 and or R7 is acyl. The hydrolysis is generally effected in water, an organic solvent or a mixture of these solvents in the absence or presence of an acid, for example, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, benzensulfonic acid, methanesulfonic acid, p toluenesulfonic acid and the like, or a base, for example, ammonia, sodium bicarbonate, triethylamine, pyridine, picoline and the like. The hydrolysis is generally conducted at a temperature ranging from about 200C to about 1500C, but, in most instances, it proceeds sufficiently at ambient temperature. In this reaction, the carboxylic acid ester of the compound I may be simultaneously hydrolyzed, but when the ester form is desired it can be easily prepared by subjecting the compound obtained after hydrolysis to a conventional esterification procedure. Contrary to the above, the compound I wherein R6 and or R7 is acyl can also be prepared by acylating the compound I wherein R6 and or R7 is hydrogen. The above acylation can be carried out in the same manner as described for the acylation of the compound II . Further, the compound of the formula I above can also be produced by reacting a compound represented by the formula EMI5.1 wherein R5 represents hydrogen, lower alkyl or CH22 Y and Z each represent halogen or a group represented by R9So20 R9 is C1 4alkyl, phenyl or p tolyl and the other symbols are as defined above , with a compound represented by the formula R6SM and or R7 SM V V wherein R6 and R7 are as defined above and M represents hydrogen or an alkali metal. In the above process, the lower alkyl represented by R5 in the formula IV corresponds to the lower alkyl ofR5, the halogen represented by Y and Z includes chlorine, bromine and iodine, and the alkali metal represented by M in the formulae V and V includes lithium, sodium, potassium and the like. The reaction is conducted in a suitable solvent with heating or cooling at a temperature ranging from about 200C to about 1500C. When M is hydrogen, the reaction may proceed advantageously in the presence of a base, for example, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, ammonia, pyridine, triethylamine and the like. When R6 and R7 are different from each other, the compounds V and V can be reacted simultaneously or in sequence with the compound IV . The compound of the formula I wherein R6 and R7 jointly represent a single bond, i.e., the compound represented by the formula Ia can also be prepared by oxidizing the compound of the formula I wherein R6 andR7 are hydrogen. As the procedure of the above oxidation, there may be mentioned oxidation procedures using, for example, 1 air or oxygen, 2 halogen such as chlorine, bromine or iodine, 3 peroxides, for example, hydrogen peroxide, sodium peroxide, potassium peroxide, peracetic acid, perbenzoic acid, m chloroperbenzoic acid, periodic acid, perchloric acid, potassium perchlorate, etc. 4 ferric compounds, for example, potassium ferricyanide, ferric chloride, etc., 5 sodium tetrathionate Na2S4O6 , 6 sulfoxide compounds, for example, dimethylsulfoxide, etc., or 7 an oxidase. In addition to the above procedures, any other procedures for oxidizing a mercaptan into a disulfide can be employed. The above oxidation reaction is generally carried out in water, an organic solvent or a mixture thereof, and the organic solvent may be any type of solvent so long as it is capable of dissolving the starting materials and it does not adversely affect the reaction. The reaction temperature varied depending upon the oxidation procedure used, but is preferably from about 200C to about 1000C and, in most instances, the reaction proceeds adequately at ambient temperature. Also, in order to promote the reaction, a suitable catalyst such as an acid e.g. hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, acetic acid , a base e.g.ammonia, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium ethoxide, triethylamine , a metal ion e.g. a sodium, potassium, calcium, iron, nickel or cobalt ion , silica gel, alumina, activated carbon or diatomaceous earth may be used. In this reaction, the compound I wherein R6 and R7 are hydrogen atoms as raw material can be used in the form of a salt at the carboxyl moiety and or the mercapto moiety for example, a sodium,potassium or magnesium salt, etc. . The desired compound I thus obtained can be isolated from the reaction mixture by conventional separation and purification procedures, for example, extraction, concentration, neutralization, filtration, recrystallization, column chromatography, thin layer chromatography and the like. When R4 represents hydrogen, the compound I can be isolated in the form of a free acid or a salt which includes a pharmaceutically acceptable salt such as a salt with an inorganic base e.g. sodium salt, potassium salt, calcium salt, lithium salt, aluminum salt, magnesium salt, barium salt, ammonium salt, etc. or an organic base addition salt e.g. methylamine salt, diethylamine salt, triethylamine salt, dicyclohexylamine salt, dibenzylamine salt, hydrazine salt, hydralazine salt, guanidine salt, arginine salt, histidine salt, pyridinium salt, imidazolium salt, quinine salt, cinchonine salt, quinidine salt, cinchonidine salt, etc. . Also, the free acid I can be converted into an ester form by a conventional esterification procedure. The compound represented by the formula I according to the present invention has 1 to 3 asymmetric carbons in the molecule and, therefore, may exist as 2 to 8 isomers.Each of these isomers as well as a mixture of these isomers are of course included within the scope of the present invention, and these isomers can be prepared separately if desired.That is, an optical isomer of the compound I may be obtained by conducting the above reaction using the corresponding optical isomer of either the starting material II or III , the isomer being obtained by optical resolution previously conducted. When at least one of II and z is a racemate, the compound I may be generally obtained as a mixture of isomers, but, if desired, these isomers can be separated into each of the isomers in accordance with a usual optical resolution procedure, for example, a method comprising the formation of a salt with an optically active base for example, cinchonine, cinchonidine, quinine, quinidine, etc. or a method comprising chromatography, fractional recrystallization, etc. The compounds of the present invention, i.e., the bicyclic compounds represented by the formula I and the salts thereof, exhibit inhibitory activities on angiotensinI converting enzyme, bradykinin decomposing enzyme kininase and encephalinase in animals, in particular, mammals and therefore are useful as drugs for diagnosis, prevention or treatment of hypertension and as analgesic and analgesic activity potentiating agents. The compounds of the present invention are of low toxicity, well absorbed even on oral administration and highly stable.Therefore, when they are used as the above mentioned drugs, they can safely be administered orally or parenterally, per se or in admixture with suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients or diluents in various pharmaceutical formulations such as powders, granules, tablets, capsules, injectable solutions, etc. While the dosage level generally varies depending upon the conditions of the diseases to be treated as well as the administration route used, for example, in the treatment of hypertension in adult human, the compounds may be administered orally at a single dose of about 0.02 20 mg kg, preferably about 0.2 2 mg kg, or intravenously at about 0.002 0.2 mg kg, preferably about 0.02 0.2 mg kg, about 2 to 5 times per day according to the conditions. In the above mentioned pharmaceutical uses, preferred embodiments among compounds I of the present invention are those compounds wherein X is methylene and n is 2, namely compounds having an indane ring structure, with the amino acid side chain being present preferably in the 2position of the indane ring. Such compounds are represented by the following formula I EMI9.1 wherein all the symbols are as defined above. With respect to the compounds of the above formula I , it is preferred that R1 and R2 are both hydrogen atoms or both methoxy groups especially at the 5 and 6positions , that R3 and R4 are hydrogen atoms, and that R5 is methyl. When R5 is methyl, it has preferably a Sconfiguration. The starting compounds II in the present invention can be prepared, for example, 1 by reacting a cyclic ketone of the formula EMI9.2 therein all the symbols are as defined above with a compound of the formula EMI9.3 wherein R3 and R4 are as defined above and reducing the resultant, so called Schiff base or 2 by reacting the cyclic ketone VI with benzylamine under a ruductive condition, reacting the resulting compound of the formula EMI9.4 wherein all the symbols are defined above with a compound of the formula EMI10.1 wherein R3 and R4 are as defined above and Y is defined as Y in the formula IV and then subjecting the resulting compound of the formula EMI10.2 wherein all the symbols are as defined above to catalytic reduction or 3 by reacting a compound of the formula EMI10.3 wherein all the symbols are as defined above with the compound IX . These methods for preparing compounds II will be illustrated in detail. Method 1 is carried out by first reacting compound VI with compound VII in an appropriate solvent to form a Schiff base and subjecting theSchiff base to reduction. As the solvent, there may be mentioned an organic solvent such as methanol, ethanol, dioxane, methylene chloride, chloroform, benzene or toluene, and the reaction may be generally carried out at a temperature within the range of about 100C to about 1500C. For advantageously accelerating the reaction, a catalyst e.g. sulfuric acid or p toluenesulfonic acid or a dehydrating agent e.g. anhydrous sodium sulfate, anhydrous magnesium sulfate or calcium chloride may be added to the reaction mixture.It is also possible to advantageously promote the reaction by carrying out the reaction using a water separating device. The Schiff base, as it is in the reaction mixture or after isolation in the conventional manner and redissolution in a solvent, is subjected to reduction. The reduction procedure may for example be catalytic reduction using as a catalyst such as platinum or palladium carbon, or reduction using such a reducing agent as sodium borohydride or sodium cyanoborohydride. It is also possible to make the formation of theSchiff base and reduction thereof proceed simultaneously by making such reducing agent coexist in the reaction mixture of VI and VII from the beginning. The reaction of IV and benzylamine in Method 2 , like the reaction of VI and VII in method 1 , proceeds via a Schiff base.The reaction of VIE and IX is effected by maintaining both the reactants in an appropriate organic solvent at a temperature within the range of about 100C to about 2000C.In this case, such a base as potassium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, sodium hydrogen carbonate or pyridine may be made to coexist in the reaction system as a deacidifying agent for the purpose of accelerating the reaction.Compounds X produced by this reaction are debenzylated by catalytic reduction using, for example, palladium carbon as a catalyst, to give compounds II . The catalytic reduction i s carsied out at ordinary pressure or under pressure up to about 150 kg cm2 and at ordinary temperature to 1500C. Generally, the reaction proceeds in a satisfactory manner at ordinary temperature and pressure. The reaction of XI and IX in Method 3 may be carried out under the same conditions as for the reaction of Vm and IX . The present invention will be illustrated more detailedly by the following reference examples, examples, experiments and preparation examples, which, however, should by no means be construed as limitative of the present invention. Reference Example 1 In 300 ml of benzene are dissolved 5,6 dimethoxy lindanone 19 g , benzylamine 12 g and p toluenesulfonic acid 5 g . The mixture is refluxed for 7 hours while removing the water formed in the reaction system by means of a water separator. The insolubles are then filtered off, and the filtrate is concentrated by distilling the solvent off under reduced pressure. The residue is dissolved in 200 ml of methanol, and 5.0 g of sodium borohydride is added portionwise under ice cooling. After stirring at room temperature for 30 minutes, the reaction mixture is poured into 1 liter of ice water and extracted with 500 ml of ethyl acetate. The extract is washed with water, dried, and evaporated to remove the ethyl acetate.To the residue are added 10 ml of 20 alcoholic hydrochloric acid and then 200 ml of ethyl ether.

Experimental Method The experiment was conducted in accordance with a modification of the method described by Cushman et al. Biochemical Pharmacology, Vol. 20, pl637 1971 1. That is, using hippuryl t histidyl L leucine HHL as the substrate, the ACE angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitory activity was determined in terms of percent inhibition on the amount of hippuric acid produced by ACE when the present compound was added. A solution of the compound of the present invention dissolved in a 0.02 to 2 dimethyl sulfoxide 500 mM potassium phosphate buffer solution pH 8.3, containing 300 mM sodium chloride was added to 100 p1 of ACE protein concentration, 20 mg ml and 100 p1 of 1.25 mM HHL. In this experiment, a potassium phosphate buffer solution containing dimethyl sulfoxide at a concentration equal to that of the test solution was used as a control.After incubating the solution at 370C for one hour, 150 p1 of 1N hydrochloric acid was added to the solution to terminate the reaction. After 1 ml of ethyl acetate was added, the solution was centrifuged at 3000 r.p.m. for 10 minutes. A 0.5 ml aliquot was separated from the ethyl acetate layer and dried at a temperature below 500C under nitrogen gas streams. The residue was mixed with 5 ml of 1M aqueous sodium chloride and the mixture was subjected to colorimetry at a wavelength of 228 nm. Test Result The test results obtained with respect to the compounds of Examples 6, 21, 32, 38, 40, 43 and 45 are shown in Table 5 below.

The rats were anesthetized with intraperitoneal administration of pentobarbital sodium 50 mg kg on the day before the test day and a polyethylene tube was inserted into each of the femoral artery for measurement of blood pressure and the femoral vein for injection of angiotensin I and II, and then the tubes were fixed. On the test day, an average blood pressure in the control phase was recorded on an electric hemodynamometer MP 4T model manufactured by Nippon Koden, Japan and thereafter angiotensin I and then angiotensin II were injected through the femoral vein at a dose of 300 ng kg and 100 ng kg respectively, to measure the hypertensive activity. Then, 13.8 pM kg of the compound of this invention was administered orally as an aqueous solution or an aqueous gum arabic suspension, and 20, 60 and 120 minutes after the administration, angiotensin I and II were injected repeatedly to trace hypertensive reactions. In calculating the percent inhibition to the hypertensive acitivity of angiotensin I, the percent inhibitory value was corrected based on the variation with time in the hypertensive reaction by angiotensin II.
