# Removal of dinitrogen difluoride from atmospheres containing nitrogen trifluoride.

## Abstract
A process for removing dinitrogen difluoride from an atmosphere containing nitrogen trifluoride comprises bringing the atmosphere into contact with a metal capable of defluorinating dinitrogen difluoride but inert to nitrogen trifluoride and maintaining the metal and the atmosphere in contact at a sufficient temperature and for a sufficient time to effect the required degrees of defluorination of the dinitrogen difluoride. Preferably, the metal is selected from the group consisting of iron, cobalt and nickel and the temperature is between 300 and 1,000 F. The process is limited to atmospheres where the concentration of dinitrogen difluoride does not exceed 5 by volume.
