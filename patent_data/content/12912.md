# Thin film magnetic transducers.

## Abstract
A thin film magnetic transducer for reading and writing a track on a magnetic recording medium consists of layers deposited on a deposition surface of a non magnetic subs trate 20 which has an air bearing surface ABS at right angles to the deposition surface. Two of the layers 14, 15 are of magnetic material to form a yoke 13 with a pole tip region having a transducing gap 18 at the air bearing surface ABS , and with a back region. A read write coil 10a to 10h is coupled to the back region. The pole tip region has a width approximating to track width and a length D of approximately 5 d where d is the recording density on the recording medium in order to minim ise signals from adjacent tracks and maximise read resolu tion. The thickness and width of the layers 14, 15 in the back region are greater than those dimensions in the pole tip reg ion, the increase in width being provided by a taper. The width of the back region is greater than the width of the pole tip region, the wider back region tapering to join the pole tip region. Also the thickness of the back region magnetic layers 14,15 is at least 60 greater than the thickness of the pole tip region. The back region is designed taking into account sat uration to provide an efficient write operation.
