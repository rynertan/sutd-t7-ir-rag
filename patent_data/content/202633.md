# Processing circuit capable of raising throughput of accumulation.

## Abstract
In a processing circuit for successively accumulating a first predetermined number of products, each product is shifted in a barrel shifter 20 downwards by a second predermined number of bits determined in relation to the first predetermined number and is successively added to a previous result of accumulation in an arithmetic logic unit ALU 21 the first predetermined number of times to produce a final result of accumulation. The first result is shifted in a shifter 27 upwards by a third predetermined number of bits determined in relation to the second predeter mined number. An overflow detector 26 monitors each result of accumulation to detect occurrence of an overflow in the ALU and the shifter to substitute either a positive or a negative maximum number for each result by an overflow corrector 25 on occurrence of the overflow. The substituted maximum number or the shifted final result is produced as an output signal.
