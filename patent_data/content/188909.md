# DEVICE AND METHOD FOR COMPENSATING FOR SENSOR ERROR IN SYSTEM CALCULATING DYNAMIC PRESSURE

## Abstract
A system for compensating for sensor calibration drift in systems calculating dynamic pressure for computing airspeed for low airspeed applications. During a preflight calibration mode, the same pressure is supplied both to a static pressure sensor 10 and to a total pressure sensor 12 . The calculated apparent dynamic pressure therefore represents the calibra tion error and values of this are stored in a memory 16 at var ious static pressures. During a flight mode the dynamic pres sure errors corresponding to static pressure at the operating location are used to provide a corrected dynamic pressure, which may then be used to provide an accurate indicated air speed.
