## Description
IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO ORGANIC COMPOUNDS The invention relates to the preparation of improved fluid loss reducing additives for use in oil based drilling, completion and packer fluids and to the products so obtained. In the drilling of wells by the rotary drilling technique drilling fluid is circulated from tanks at the wellhead down the inside of the drill pipe, through the bit and back up the annulus. On reaching the wellhead the fluids are subjected to a number of treatments designed to remove gases or solid materials such as drilled cuttings, sand, colloidal material, etc. from the fluid before being returned to the well via the mud tanks.During the course of this circulation the properties of the drilling fluid change due to a number of factors such as ingress of water or fine solids or temperature degradation of the components of the fluid. As a result the fluid is treated to regenerate the required properties and this treatment generally involves the addition of chemicals. As the total reserves of oil diminish it has become necessary to drill in areas which were previously inaccessible due to technological or economic difficulties.This has led to the development of increasingly sophisticated drilling fluids and in particular to the widespread use of oil based fluids. These have a number of advantages over conventional water based drilling fluids. Oil based fluids are less prone to thermal degradation than water based fluids and as a result are used to drill deep hot holes. In order to drill effectively from offshore platforms economics dictate that as much of the field as possible should be exploited from each platform. This has led to an increase in the number of deviated wells and also to an increase in the maximum angle of deviation. The latter causes a marked increase in the torque required to maintain rotation of the drill string. Oil based drilling fluids exhibit extremely good lubricity compared with water based fluids and have proved particularly effective in the drilling of deviated wells. Drilling through hydratable shales has proved troublesome due to the swelling and sloughing of these formations on contact with aqueous drilling fluids. The problem is common throughout the world and not only leads to wellbores which are out of gauge but also to torque and stuck pipe problems. Oil based drilling fluids do not affect most shales and are ideally suited to drilling through these formations. In order to achieve maximum production rate from a well it is important that the fluid used to penetrate the production zone and the subsequent completion fluid do not damage the formation. Oil based drilling fluids are designed to give a filtrate consisting only of oil and since this is essentially native to the production formation it does not lead to a reduction in permeability.Aqueous fluids can cause loss of productivity due to pore contraction and blocking as a result of the hydration of clays. Other types of fluid which are used in well working operations include completion fluids and packer fluids.Completion fluids are used to flush out the well before it is cemented and the metal casing is inserted. Packer fluids are then used to fill the annular space between the casing and the walls of the hole. Because these fluids remain in contact with metal surfaces over prolonged periods, corrosion is a serious problem here oilbased packer fluids have the advantage of being essentially non corrosive. Drilling fluids, completion fluids and packer fluids are referred to generally in this specification as wellworking fluids , or muds . Oil based well working fluids can be classified as true oil muds and invert emulsion muds. The former contain only a small amount of water whilst the latter may contain up to 40 water as the dispersed phase of an invert water in oil emulsion. Each of these fluids may contain a number of additives such as emulsifiers, viscosifiers, fluid loss reducing additives and various inorganic salts. Fluid loss reducing additives are added to minimise loss of the well working fluid by filtration of the fluid through porous strata. Such products are generally asphaltic or lignitic. Known lignitic fluid loss reducing additives for oil based well working fluids are prepared by reacting humic acid the alkali soluble fraction of lignite in free acid or sodium salt form with a long chain alkyl substituted amine or ammonium salt in an aqueous medium.The products are dried and then dispersed in an oil based well working fluid, generally with the aid of various organic compounds as dispersing agents. Other lignitic fluid loss reducing additives may be prepared by reacting humic acid with the partial fatty acid amide of a polyalkylene polyamine, either in an aqueous medium or by heating in an oil. It has now been found that lignite may be treated in an oil medium with an amine or amide amine, or a salt thereof, containing at least one long chain alkyl or alkenyl group, without application of heat, to give a product having superior fluid loss reducing activity. The product is obtained by a simple mixing process and it is unnecessary to isolate the humic acid in its sodium salt form or to isolate the substituted ammonium humate and subsequently disperse it in the oil based fluid. Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the production of a fluid loss reducing additive for an oil based well working fluid comprising the step of mixing together lignite or humic acid with an oilsoluble or oil dispersible amine salt, amide amine or amide amine salt containing at least one alkyl, alkenyl or acyl radical having from 12 to 22 carbon atoms in a straight chain, in an oil or oil based fluid at a temperature not greater than 700C, preferably not greater than 50 C. The particle size of the lignite is not critical but is preferably less than 500 microns. The presence of a few larger particles does not necessarily detract from the performance of the products, but may lead to settlement during prolonged storage. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the mixing conditions are such that larger particles are broken down during the course of the preparation of the products. The amine salts and other amine derivatives for use in the process of the invention all contain a group R or RyCO where Rx is an alkyl or alkenyl group which x may be linear or branched, but which contains a straight chain of from 12 to 22 carbon atoms, and R is a corres y ponding group containing a straight chain of from 11 to 21 carbon atoms. Preferably R is a linear group for x example stearyl, oleyl, linoleyl, palmityl, or mixtures containing primarily linear C12 22alkyl or alkenyl groups, and RyCO is the corresponding stearoyl, oleoyl, linoleoyl or palmitoyl group. Preferred amine salts are those of formula I R xO I 1 2 3 in which either R1 is R or RXNHA where A is C26 x x alkylene, and R2 and R3, independently, are Rx, hydrogen, C1 12alkyl, phenyl or benzyl or together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached form a 5 or 6 membered heterocyclic ring or R1 and R2 together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached, form an imidazoline ring bearing an Rx substituent and R3 is a NH2 A group where A is defined above or a fatty acid amide thereof and XV is an anion. The anion is preferably an anion of phosphoric acid or of an organic fatty acid, and is preferably of formula Ry CO . More preferred amine salts are those of formulaeIa Ic Rx NH3 RyCO0 Ia RXNH CH2 n NH3 RyCOO 3 IbEMI7.1 in which n is 2 or 3. Wherever, as in formula Ic, the same symbol appears more than once in a formula, that symbol may have identical or different significances unless stated otherwise. Particularly preferred are the compound of formulaIa in which Rx is predominantly n C15H31 and RyCOO is oleate derived from distilled tall oil fatty acid and that of formula Ic in which n is 2, Rx is oleyl, RyCO is oleoyl and R CO is oleate, all derived from distil y led tall oil. Preferred amide amines are the reaction products of a fatty acid or fatty acid derivative with an alkylene diamine or polyalkylene polyamine, preferably containing from 3 to 7 amine groups. Preferred amideamines are derived from linear di or poly amines of formula II EMI8.1 in which R4 is H, Rx or C2 6hydroxyalkyl x 0 or 1 5 and n is as defined above. Preferably where x 0, R4 is Rx or C2 6hydroxyalkyl,preferably 2 hydroxyethyl and where x 1 5, R4 is H. The compound of formula II contains x 2 amine groups, and is capable of reacting with x 2 moles of fatty acid, without the difficult step of forming two amide groups on the same primary amino group. It is preferred that less than x 2 moles of acid are reacted, leaving some amine groups free or in salt form. The fully reacted compounds are also useful in the process of the invention, and are included within the definition of amide amines for the purpose of this specification. When R4 is hydrogen or hydroxyalkyl, at least part of the fatty acid must be of the formula RyCOOH, and preferably whatever the significance of R4, the fatty acid is entirely of formula Ry COOH, and is preferably a linear fatty acid such as stearic, oleic, linoleic or palmitic acid, or mixtures of these and other acids for example crude oleic acid derived from tallow or from crude or distilled tall oil, which may contain acids derived from resins, for example abietic acid. Suitable amide amines whose unreacted amine groups remain in free base form have a degree of amidation of 30 100 . That is, they are the product of reacting an amine of formula II with 30 100 of the theoretical amount of fatty acid required to amidate once each amine group. Preferably the degree of amidation is 40 80 , more preferably 50 60 . Preferably, however, after the amidation reaction a sufficient quantity of the same or a different acid is added to convert 15 100 of the unreacted amine groups to the salt form. More preferably 50 100 , particularly 80 to 100 , more particularly 100 of the unreacted amine groups are converted to the salt form. When at least 15 of the unreacted amine groups will be present in salt form, then the preferred degree of amidation is 10 80 , more preferably 30 80 , most preferably 40 to 70 . Preferably the acid used to form salt groups is phosphoric acid or an organic fatty acid, more preferably the same as that used to form the amide groups. The reaction of a polyalkylene polyamine with a fatty acid in the preferred proportions will give a complex mixture of reaction products. Thos from polyethylene polyamines may cyclise to imidazolines of the type of formula Ic or more complex types, and such products are also useful in the process of the invention and fail within the general term amide amines. It is preferred,however, that if imidazoline rings are formed, there is sufficient acid present to convert the singlybonded ring nitrogen atoms at least partially, and preferably completely, to the salt form. Particularly preferred amide amines include for example the mono oleylamide of aminopropyl tallow amine diethylene triamine di oleylamide tetraethylene pentamine tris oleylamide and tetraethylene pentamine 21 2 oleylamide in which all remaining amine groups are in the oleate salt form. In these compounds the oleyl and oleate groups are preferably derived from tall oil, particularly from distilled tall oil. A further preferred amide amine is the reaction product of a high resin tall oil fatty acid with a polyethylene polyamine, having a primary secondary tertiary amine ratio of 7.25 2.25 1 and 0.43 mole g of primary amine groups, and neutralised to pH 6 8, which is commercially available in the form of a mixture with light oil 50 oil under the name Emul BW Mud Ltd. , and is used as an emulsifier in invert emulsion muds. The proportion of amine derivative to lignite in the products of the invention may vary between wide limits. If too little amine is used, the lignite tends to separate out excess of amine is generally not harmful, but may be uneconomic. Typical proportions are in the range of 1 2 to 2 1 lignite amine by weight, preferably approximately 1 1. The oil used for the purposes of the present invention is most often diesel oil but may also be one of a number of crude fractions, kerosine etc. The oil chosen should be compatible with the oil based wellworking fluid to which the product will be added. The product of the present invention is preferably a pourable liquid concentrate which may be added to a well working fluid as required, for example to make up a new mud or to recondition a used mud. In the concentrate, the ratio of lignite amine to oil or oil based liquid is normally from 1 4 to 4 1, preferably 1 2 to 2 1, more preferably 1 1, by weight. The concentrate is added to the well working fluid so as to give a concentration of lignite amine in the fluid of from preferably of from 1 to 10 pounds per barrel approx. 0.28 to 2.8 wt vol , more preferably 2 5 p.p.b. Since it is normally intended that the products of this invention be used without further processing it is advantageous to ensure that settlement of lignite materials does not occur under normal storage conditions.This can be achieved by adding an oleophilic bentonite or an oleophilic attapulgite. Many products of this type are available and their use will be familiar to those skilled in the art. In most cases only a few percent by weight of these viscosifiers will be required to stabilise the product.It may be advantageous to add a small volume of water to enhance the viscosifying properties of these oleophilic bentonites and attapulgites. The process of the present invention is carried out by simply mixing the various components. The period and conditions of mixing are not critical but the storage stability of the product is enhanced by applying vigorous shear. The use of a high speed mixer of the Silverson type is particularly preferred in producing products having good fluid loss reducing properties and storage stability. Mixing is preferably carried out at normal ambient temperature plus whatever temperature rise occurs as a consequence of the mixing process. It is an advantage of the process according to the invention that it is carried out at a temperature below the flash point of diesel oil 700C It is also found that the addition of small quantities of water to the composition gives a more rapid interaction between the amine derivative and the lignite and gives rise to superior fluid loss reducing properties.The water may be added before or during the mixing operation, but it is most desirable that the lignite be oil wetted before any water is added that is, the reaction of the lignite with the amine derivative takes place essentially in an oil medium and not in an aqueous medium. Typically the quantity of water used may be from 1 to 15 by weight of the total quantity of lignite plus amine present, preferably 5 to 10 by weight. The following Examples illustrate the invention EXAMPLES 1 to 5 Five products were obtained by mixing a groundNorth Dakoto lignite with varying quantities of diesel oil, Emul BW Mud Ltd. and water on a multimixer for four hours.
