# Sheet receiving apparatus.

## Abstract
Sheet receiving apparatus for a cash dispenser comprises a sheet container to which a lid 19 is pivotally connected. A T shaped moulding 24 is positioned in the lid 19 to lock the lid to the container when the lid is in a closed position. A lock retainer comprising a pin 51 is also mounted in the lid 19 for retaining the moulding 24 in an unlocked position not shown . A head portion of the pin 51 is operable to disengage the pin 51 from the moulding 24 by cooperating with a cam and slot arrangement 61, 64 in a housing 59 of the cash dis penser. Upon insertion of the container into the housing 59 , the pin 51 is received in a diagonally extending slot 61 so that the lid 19 is caused to open. In addition, the slot 61 has a laterally outwardly extending cam portion 64 which acts on the head portion of the pin 51 to withdraw the pin from en gagement with the moulding 24 . Upon withdrawal of the pin, the moulding 24 is urged into its locking position so that on withdrawal of the container from the housing 59 , the lid 19 is automatically locked to the container.
