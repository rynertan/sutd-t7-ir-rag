# Variable V belt pulley.

## Abstract
The pulleys 32 of a pulley transmission, such as a CVT, are constructed such that one flange 34 is drivingly connected to a shaft 44 by means of a flexible, pliable, spring like straps or a pack of relatively thin straps 60 . Because the pulley flange 34 which can be axially movable with respect to the shaft 44 , is radially supported by a hub 46 encircling the shaft, only one strap or strap pack 60 need be provided.
