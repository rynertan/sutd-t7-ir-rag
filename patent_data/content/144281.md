# High solids theic polyester enamels.

## Abstract
A high solids content, relatively low viscosity, organic solvent solution of polyester magnet wire enamel is de scribed. The enamel is a tris hydroxyethylisocyanurate polyester having a ratio of hydroxyl to carboxyl groups of 1.65 to 2.0 1 and a hydroxyl number of 216 to 316. Such enamels are produced with solids contents of about 50 to about 70 by weight and viscosity less 1,500 cps at 200 F. The method of making such enamel by reacting a glycol, tris hydroxy ethylisocyanurate , and an aromatic diacid or dies ter in the presence of a titanate catalyst is also described.
