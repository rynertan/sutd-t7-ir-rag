# Improved process for spinning aromatic polyamide filaments.

## Abstract
Improved aromatic polyamide fibers from aromatic polyamides whose chain extending bonds are either coaxial or parallel and oppositely directed are obtained by dry spinneret wet spinning downwardly into a shallow coagulat ing bath 1 having an orifice 11 in its bottom for removal of coagulating liquid and fibers wherein no more than a minor portion of coagulating liquid lower than the entrance of the bath orifice in the proximity of the bath orifice. Preferably, no more than 10 of the coagulating liquid is lower than the entrance of the bath orifice and most preferably none of the coagulating liquid is lower than the entrance of the bath orifice.
