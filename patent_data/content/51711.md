## Description
ITALY Cers and all means of transport with an electromotor, eouipped xwith alternetors incorporeted or connected to the wheels or driving axles for the quick and continue recheree of batteries. or of electrio energy directlv. The invention deals about cars and means of transport with alternators incorporated or con nected to the wheels or driving axles for the qui ck and continue recharge of batteries or electric energy suppliyng directly. We know already electric cars and means of transport in circulation with a limited bange, about eighthy kilometres, they are in any case liited to have little journeys, the use of ele ctric means of transpert permits not only to eco nomize the petrol, but it makes also possible the way to eliminate its use entirely These means of transport are requirede for va riaus reasons and in some cases for economic rea sons, but they never permit to have long journeys. The purpose of the present invention is that of proposing alternators incorporated or connected to wheels or driving axles which allow the conti nue supplying of electric energy to one or more rigenerators at rapid action tan hour to recharge batteries , with a remarkable possibility to keep batteries continually charged. The invention solves this purpose realizing cars and means of transport with alternators incorporated to the wheel or connected to the whe els or driving ax les. wheels and driving axles are furnished with special particulars act to rea lize the reality of tomorrow in all the means of transport. In conformity with the inventicn, e have qui cker and easier reelization in the case of an ele ctric car, the alternators incorporated to kLea or in any case connected to them, as the free whe els not the motor wheels , turn round the mixed shapt supplied with ball bearings which allow the wheels to turn round, consequeutly also the stator of the alternator will turn. To avoid any kind of problem, it is sllffi cient to invert the functions, at the stator is put the copper winding which is usually put round the rotor, and in this case the stator would beco me the rotor, and at the rotor is put the winding which is usually put round the stator of the nor al alternator, and also in this case the rotor would cage its 1 s function that is, it would beco me the stator of the alternator in conformity of the invention. The alternatos incorporated to wheels pre sent, according to variaus cases, a shaping unlike traditional that is it can be very high and in the same time it can be narrow so that it cait be applied to a bicycle or other means of tran sport. The axle of the stator en rotor presents a visible hole or sine, it goes from the inside to the outside of the axle of the alternator so that the electric wire can pass through that spa ce obtained under the bearing of the alternator and the wheel, and in this case we have the goin gout of the electric energy, in this case it is connected to another electric wire connected to a rigenerator at rapid tap which always remains connected to the battery so that all the produce .cted electric energy can be utilized. The wheels with incorporated alternator are put and fixed the wheels of the common bicycle or motor bicycle The alternators connected to wheels in con formic of ths invention are realized in cylindri cal shape so that they can oe applIed and fixed to the various means of transport with , .1 the vario ns applications in which wheels are Tixed today, but in this case we obtain the necessary space so that we can put the alternator. Also fn this ca se we have a spline at the axle of the alternator which pass under the bearing of the alternator and the same wheel, so in his case the beating, has two functions, it tnakes the alternator and the wheel turn. While, in the case of the bicycle, the going out of the electric wire is free at the two sides of the axle, in this caseitis compulsory to make it pass from the autsider part of the axle, to which it will be connect another electric wire which will take it to the rigenerator or more rapid rigenerators to which the batteries are always corrected. So the more the mean of transport runs the more electric energy it produces. In conformity of the invention in the case that the alternators is put on and fixed on the mean of transport, in this case the alternator is one of those coon and function are normal, the rotor is put in motion through driving belts, cha ins etc puttin.3 pulleys to the axle of the rotor and to the wheel, or to the axle whirl makes the wheel turn. In this case the electric wire is applied to the hold fast which are inside a box obtained at the side of the casing of the alternator, and then it will be linked to the rigenerator to which are connected batteries or a direct use can be done an the motor and in some cases it can be send to the power station It is not necessary to say that the mean of transport moving makes the wheels turn and these last make the alternators turn and so we have many moving power stations. Another application is given from the inven tion and realized in such such a manner that itis possible to ply the alternators to the height of axles or axle stahts, indeed the axle would be even incorporated or connected to the alterna tore, so that when the motor will put in motion the mean of transport, the axles must turn, and as the axles are connected to the same alternator the motion of the mean of transport will put automatically in function the alternator, which al so in this case is are of those comron with oral functions, producing electric energy. The electric wire is connected to the hold fasts of the alter nator connected then to a rigenerator and this to batteries. If the electromotor goes at battery, it has a linking with an electric wire goes rom the battery to the electromotor, if indeed it is directly connected from an electric line, shis is directly nourished by a power station. In this case the electric energy produced by the mean of transport goes directy to the power station. Another solution can be that of applying the alternator near tile motor and in any case hooked to the turning mechaniemo which anto their motion allow the alternator to produce electric energy The advantages enabled by the invention con sist essentially of the tossibslity of realizing a real source of electric energy, ejolusively sep ving of the motion of wheels or axle3 of the means of transport to which are connected or directly incorporated alternators. Besides, every planner can, at his pleasure, take cars of aesthetice of the wheels to which are incorporated alternators, also respecting the technique of Structures of wheels and alternators.
