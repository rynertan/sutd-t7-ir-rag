A capsule 10 for insertion into the rumen of an animal through the oesophagus and adapted to be retained therein while releasing a therapeutic or nutrient composition. The capsule comprises an elongate, tubular body member 12 for housing a quantity of said composition and a plurality of elongate wings 18 , with each wing pivotally attached at one end thereof to the body member in the vicinity of the leading end 14 of the body. Each wing is resiliently biased away from a storage position, to which is pivotable so as to extend along the body member, toward the trailing end 16 thereof, to a laterally extending operative position in which it is at a predetermined angle to the body member, and is con strained against pivoting beyond such angle.
