## Description
Locking Window Latci TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention relaces to apparatus ror locking a closure such as a window, comprising a member adapted to be mounted on the closure or a frame therefor and a handle pivotably mounted oil the member for turning between two end positions fr,r respectively locking and unlocking the closure. BACKGROUND ART Closures such as windows usually have a catch for securing them in a locked position. The catch has a handle secured to a back plate by a pivot pin The back plate is secured to the window or a frame or surround therefor a nib of the catch, on the opposite side of the pivot pin to the handle, is engaged with a keeper on the frame or surround or window in order to secure the window in the locked position. Such a catch is easily tampered with. It is. only necessary for the glass to be broken near it, and it is then openable from the out side simply b grasping the handle. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION It is accordingly an object of the invention to pro vide apparatus whicii setks to avoid this disadvantage. According to the invention this object is realised in that the apparatus is characterised by a lock, having a catch part or bolt for cooperaling with the member so as to prevent turning movament of the handle relative to the member in one of the two and positions when the bolt is actuated to lock the apparatus. Thus it is possible to provide a lockable window catch embodying the invention which is readily mounted on a window and which can by locked to pr vent un utherised turning of the handi to unloch the window. To simplify construction of the apparat undle may comprise a manually grippable handle and the lock m be mounted in a part of the handle adj cent the memnar whack may have a groove in which the h rt f ably a bolt, is receiv d in the one en si ion. Again, in order to simplify the construction and operation of the apparatus1 the lock may be key operated the barrel of which may have nn eccentric pin or cam opposite an entry for the key, the pin or cam being received in a recess of the bolt so that when the barrel is turned by the key the cam slides the bolt into or out of the groove. Thc handle may have an enlarged part, between a hand gt ip and a pivot pin connecting the handle and the member.This enlarged part provides a suitable site for the lock, which is accommodated in the enlarged part. Alternatively the lock may have a slidable spring mounted barrel lock which has a longitudinally projecting pin for engagement with a complementary part of the member in the one position whereby when the bolt is retracted from groove, the barrel slides under spring pressure out of the handle a distance sufficient to free the pin from the complementary part of thfJ member. The member may be an esc rtcheon plate of the closure adapted for securing to the closure by screw holes through it. This provides a simple pet aesthetically pleasing construction. In order to provide a relatively vandal proof construction, the handle an escutcheon plate may be so arranged that in said one position at least part of the handle overlies at least on screw hole. It is thus difficult for a vandal or thief to apply a tool such as a screw driver to a screw in the hole. Embodiments of the invention are hereinafter described, by way of example, with reverence to the accompanying drawings.

BEST MODES FOR CARRYING OiJT THE INVENTION Referring to the drawings, in which like parts are indicated by like reference numerals, the apparatus shown in Figures 1 and 2 is a lockable window catch 1 which has a member in the form of an escutcheon plate 2 to which is pivoted, by a pivot pin 3, a handle 4 having a hand grip part 5. The handle 4 is manually turnable between two end positions, in one of which the apparatus is locked and in the second of which the apparatus is unlocked. The handle 4 has a part 6 through which the pivot pin 3 passes and, between the pin 3 and the hand grip part 5, an enlarged part 7 in which is mounted a key operated barrel lock 8. The barrel has a projecting eccentric pin or cam 9 at the opposite end of the lock to the key hole 10.The pin 9 engages in a recess or hole 11 in a bolt 12 which is slidable in a direction at right angles to the longitudinal axis of the barrel. An adjacent part 13 of the escutcheon plate has a groove 14 in which the bolt 12 can be received in one end position of the handle 4. The escutcheon plate 2 is adapted for mounting ou a window frame by screw holes 15, 16, 17 arA 1 Q. lockable window catch 1 is, in use, secured to a window frame by screws through the four holes 15, 16, 17 and 18, after the handle 4 has been turned from the one end position shown to the left as viewed in Figure 2 in the direction of the arrow X to the other end position so that the two holes 17 and 18 are unobstructed. To close the window, it is merely necessary to return the handle 4 to the position shown in Figures 1 and 2, which action locks a nib 19 of the handle with a keeper on the window jamb not shown . To lock the catch and so secure the window against unauthorised entry, a key is inserted in the lock 8. The lock has the usual differ pins and spring mounted barrel pins. When the key is inserted the two sets of pins are retracted into the barrel against the springs until the barrel can be turned when the key is turned. Turning the barrel tends to move the eccentric cam 9 in an arc. To accommodate this, the bolt 12 slides to the left. as viewed in Figure 1 to engage in the groove 14. The catch is thus locked. To unlock the catch, the key is turned in the opposite sense in order to withdraw the bolt 12 into the space 20 so that it is free of the groove 14. The handle 4 can then be turned from the one end position. In the locked state shown, the part 4 of the handle obscures the holes 17 and 18, so preventing or hindering the unauthorisel removal of screws in these holes. This helps tormake the window catch vandal proof. The turning of the handle 4 may be assisted by the inclusion of neoprene or nylon washers 21 or .22 where shown. Figure 3 shows a lockable window catch 100 similar to that of Figures 1 and 2, but in this case the lock 8 is a slidable spring mounted barrel lock. The barrel has a projecting pin 101 which in the one end position is received in a complementary part 102, in this case the screw hole 17 of the escutcheon plate 2. A helical spring 103 encircles the pin 101 and bears between a base of the lock and the underside of the barrel. The bolt 12 has a recess 104 for receiving the eccentric pin 9. The recess 104 has a greater lateral extent than the lateral width of the pin 9. The bolt 12 is mounted under the pressure of a spring 105. The lock is shown just at the point where it unlocks the catch. The key not shown has been inserted and turned so that the bolt 12 has been moved to the right as viewed and takes up the position shown.There is now nothing to prevent the lock from sliding out of the part 3 under the pressure of the spring 103 to the position shown in dashed lines. This it does instantaneously, so withdrawing the pin 101 from the screw hole 17. The handle 4 is then free to turn from the one to the second end position. To lock tbe catch when the handle has been returned to the one end position, it is merely necessary to depress the barrel by thumb or finger pressure. When the bolt 12 reaches a position opposite the groove 13 it moves under pressure of the spring 105 into the groove, the enlarged part 104 of the recess allowing this travel without hindrance from the eccentric pin 9. The handle and escutcheon plate are then locked together once more. It will be understood that the ejection of the barrel is controlled by a screw mounted with its head in a longitudinally disposed slot also not shown . In tbe full line position of the barrel the screw head is at the upper blind end of the slot. In the dashed line position the head of the screw and the bottom of the slot are in engagement, so preventing movement of the barrel beyond the dashed line position shown in Figure 3. The slot may be in the. barrel or in the part 3 while the screw may be in the part 3 or in the barrel. In the one end position, the screw holes 17 and 18 of which only one is shown are obstructed by the part 3. Also, the part 3 has a stop not shown which prevents turning of the handle 4 beyond the one end position. The stop is a depending projection at one side of the part 3 which engages the side of the escutcheon plate when the cne end position is reached. The stop therefore provides a controlled turning of the handle to the one end window position. The stop is provided in both the catches ofFigures 1 and 2, or 3. Referring now to Figures 4 to 8 there is shown a window stay 200. The stay is pivotably mounted to an escutcheon plate 2 by a knuckle joint and pivot pin 201 so that the stay 200 can be moved vertically and horizontally with respect to the escutcheon plate 2. Adjacent a hand grip part 5 of the stay there is a casing 6 housing a keyoperated barrel lock 8 which has a key hole 202. The longitudinal axis of the barrel of the lock 8 is at right angles to the length of the stay 200. The barrel locks is of the differ pin spring pin type referred to inFigures 1, 2 and 3.A lug 203 projecting from the barrel is secured to one end of a rotatable cam 204 comprising a cylinder of which part has been cut back to just Greater than the diameter, in order to provide a flat surface 205 and a curved cam surface 206. The other end of the rotatable cam. is journalled in a part 207 of the casing 6. The stay 200 has an oblong slot 208 through it, the right hand end as viewed of which substantially coincides in the vertical plane, with the flat surface 205 when this is vertical and in the unlocked position of the lock. Ehe stay 200 co operates with a keeper Figure 7 209. The keeper 209 is secured, as by screws through screw holes 210, to the window sill at a position where its upstanding body 211 can pass through the slot 208 when the stay 200 is moved vertically down over it.It will of course be appreciated that the body 211 has a length and width sufficient for it to pass through the slot 208. In order to lock the window when the keeper 207 is in the slot 208, in the one end or closed position, the key is inserted in the key hole 202 and turned this turns the barrel 8 which automatically turns the lug 203 integral therewith. The lug 203 then turns the rotatable cam 204 about its longitudinal axis. This turning brings the curved cam surface 206 into 3 rebate 212 of the keeper 209 so that that surface 206 is vertically underneath a top part 213 of the keeper. The stay 200 cannot then be moved vertically and the window is locked.To unlock the stay 200, it is merely necessary to turn the curved cam surface 204, via operation of the key, to retract that surface to the right as viewed in Figure 5 clear of the part 213 of the keeper 209, the flat surface 205 then being substantially in alignment with, but just clearing, the free end of the part 213 so that the stay 200 can be lifted and used in the usual way for opening the window and keeping it open.For this, the stay 200 is lowered so that a spigot 214, also secured to the sill enters one of several holes 215 through the stay 200. It will be understood that the turning barrel lock 8 described may be replaced by a slidable spring mounted barrel lock of the kind shown in Figure 3. In this case the barrel retracts sufficiently from the barrel to clear the recess in the keeper in which it is again received in the locked condition. Referring now to Figures 9 and 10, the apparatus shown is a lockable window catch 300 which is suitable for connection to an espagnolette for a closure such as french window. The catch 300 is similar to the catch 1 of Figures 1 and 2. In catch 300, however, the handle 5 and the pin 3 are modified. The handle 5 has a square hole 301 in which a square head 302 of the pin 3 seats so that the outer surface of the handle part 6 of the head 302 are substantially flush. The pin 3 has a cylindrical part 303 which extends through the part 6 into the escutcheon plate where there is an enlarged hole 304. The pin 3 is secured in position by a circlip 305 encircl ing the cylindrical part 303 of the pin 3. The cylindrical part 303 leads to a square section part 306 which projects beyond the lower or rear surface of the escutcheon plate 2 so that that square section part 306 can engage in the plate of an espagnolette. In use, the escutcheon plate 2 is mounted on a closure frame as before with the square part 306 of the pin passing through a hole in that frame and being secured In the plate of the espagnolette. The espagno lette plate has two substantially rigid rods for engaging respective upper and lower keepers to keep the closure shut. When the lock 8 is unlocked, the handle 5 can be turned. This in turn rotates the pin 3 because of the engagement of the square head 302 in the square hole 301.The square section part 306 of the pin 3 in turn rotates the espagnolette plate and this throws the rods and either engages the rods with their keepers, or disengages them from their keepers, depending on the direction of rotation, to lock or unlock the closure. When the lock 8 is locked, the handle 5 cannot be turned, so preventing or hindering unauthorised opening, as in the previous embodiments. It will be understood that the embodiment 6f Figures 9 and 10 may be mounted on the edge of door or window in which there is a mortice for the rods, which are accordingly hidden apart from at the top and bottom when in the locked position. The rods are operated in the same way as above described. It will be appreciated too that the lock can be of the kind shown in Figure 3. Also, the head of the pin 3 and the hole in the part 6 may have any suitable shape other than square, e.g. hexagonal.
