# Method and apparatus for encoding a binary data stream into a binary code stream.

## Abstract
In an encode method in which a binary data stream is di vided into data words each of three bits. Each of the data words is encoded into a binary code word of 9 bits. In the method, a code word to be encoded is encoded in consideration of a code word preceding the code word and two code words succeed ing the code word. Then, one of the first two code bits in each code word and two of the last five code bits in the preceeding code word are inverted according to a pattern of code bits 0 and 1 in both the code words. As a result, consecutive 5 to 19 code bits 0 are arrayed between two adjacent code bits 1 in the code word stream.
