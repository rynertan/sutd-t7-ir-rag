## Description
This invention relates to a process for polymerizing ethylene at a temperature not lower than 125 C and under a pressure not lower than 20 MPa 200 kg cm² to produce polyethylene having a high molecular weight. Recently, a process for polymerizing ethylene at a high temperature and under a high pressure in the presence of a Ziegler type catalyst by using a conventional high pressure ethylene polymerization apparatus, as described in British Patent No. 828,828 Specification has been proposed. This method is advantageous for industrial production of linear chain low density polyethylene LLDPE for the following reasons. First of all, conventional high pressure polyethylene producing apparatus can be used as they are no investment in equipment is needed. Secondly, although removal of heat is a serious problem in the polymerization process because of the exothermic reaction of ethylene polymerization, by this method polymerization can be conducted at a high temperature to increase the temperature difference between the inner temperature and that of a cooling carrier, which results in increasing efficiency in removal of heat and, thus, enhancing conversion to polymers. Thirdly, it is not necessary to remove a solvent from the polymer produced, and the polymer can be readily separated. Fourth, because the resulting polymer is in a molten state, it is not necessary to melt the polymer for pelletizing unlike in the cases of liquid phase polymerization and suspension polymerization, and, thus, the method is advantageous with respect to energy. On the other hand, a problem in high temperature and high presure polymerization process is that polymers having a sufficiently low melt flow index hereinafter, abbreviated to MFR cannot be produced since the chain transfer rate of ethylene is much greater than the growth rate of ethylene at a high temperature. This problem is particularly serious in the copolymerization of ethylene with an α olefin. This is because the chain transfer rate of α olefins is greater than that of ethylene, and, thus, lowering of the MFR of the resulting polymer becomes more difficult. The problem of the MFR of the resulting polymer being too high can be solved with a low polymerization temperature. Such solution of the problem, however, sets the upper limit of the polymerization temperature with respect to the MFR of the desired polymer, resulting in decrease in conversion to polymer. Another problem in the above mentioned polymerization under high temperature and high pressure is that it is difficult to omit a removal step of catalyst residues. In the case where the catalyst employed has a low polymerization activity, a large amount of the catalyst residue remains in the resulting olefin polymer to raise serious problems with respect to the properties of the polymer product such as thermal stability, colour, and odor. Moreover, high temperature and high pressure polymerization is apt to produce a waxy polymer having a low molecular weight. Formation of such a low molecular weight waxy polymer has an adverse effect on the commercial quality of the resulting polymer product. In addition, there is a further problem in that the high temperature and high pressure polymerization produces a large amount of double bonds in the resulting polymer. When a large amount of double bonds is present in the polymer, especially inside of the polymer chain, the polymer is apt to be oxidatively decomposed and give rise to a deterioration of weather resistance. Thus, it is important for industrialization of the above mentioned art to develop a catalyst which, in high temperature high pressure polymerization, has a high activity as well the capability to produce polymers having a broad range of MFR including a low MFR region and excellent quality. The EP A 86 643, BE A 855 707 and EP A 86 473 are directed to conventional slurry polymerization of ethylene at a relatively low temperature and under a relatively low pressure, namely 70 C and 0,7 MPa at the highest or 0,28 MPa. Normally a catalyst for the polymerization of ethylene at a low temperature and under a low pressure is not effective at higher temperature and under a higher pressure. US A 4 405 774 discloses ethylene copolymers produced by polymerization at a higher temperature and under a high pressure. However the copolymers have a higher MFR, i.e. a lower molecular weight. An object of the present invention is to solve the above described problems, which object can be achieved by using a specified combination of catalyst components in the polymerization of ethylene. Thus, the process for polymerizing ethylene according to the present invention is performed in the presence of a catalyst consisting essentially of a combination of the following components A , B , and C By conducting homopolymerization or copolymerization of ethylene using specified catalyst components at a temperature not lower than 125 C and under pressure not lower than 20 MPa 200 kg cm² according to the present invention, it has become possible to produce, with high catalytic activity, polyethylene having a broad range of MFR including a low MFR region and to enhance polymer conversion rate owing to a rise in polymerization temperature. In addition, in spite of high temperature and high pressure polymerization, the process according to the invention provides a polymer of good quality because of narrower distribution in molecular weight, a smaller amount of wax contained in the polymer and a reduced amount of double bonds in the polymer. The catalyst according to the present invention consists essentially of a combination of the following components A , B , and C .

Also, polymerization can be conducted by using a plurality of reactors connected in series, as necessary equipped with a condenser. Moreover, it is possible to employ a single reactor the interior of which is effectively divided into several regions so as to conduct multi zone operation. In the multi zone operation, it is possible to differentiate the reaction conditions in each zone by adjusting the monomer composition, catalyst concentration, and amount of molecular weight regulator, in each of the reactors or reaction zones so as to control the characteristics of the polymer obtained in each polymerization zone. In the case where plural reactors are combined, various combinations can be adopted, such as combinations of a tubular reactor with another tubular one, a tank reactor with another tank reactor, and a tank reactor with a tubular one. The polymer produced in the reactor can be isolated from unreacted monomer s and then treated similarly as in the case of high pressure polyethylene. The unreacted monomer s can be pressurized again and circulated into the reactor. The catalyst is preferably injected directly into the reactor by means of a pump in the form of a fine dispersion in a suitable inert solvent.

The average residence time in a reactor depends on the activity holding time of the catalyst employed. It is preferable that the longer the activity holding time of the catalyst is, the longer the average residence time will be. The average residence time in the present invention is normally in the range of 2 to 600 s, preferably in the range of 5 to 150 s, and more preferably in the range of 10 to 120 s. In the present invention, a liquid medium is introduced only in a small amount as a catalyst dispersing agent or for other purposes, and polymerization is conducted substantially in the absence of a liquid medium.
