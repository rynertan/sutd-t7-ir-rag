# Integrated circuit device and method of diagnosing the same.

## Abstract
A method of diagnosing an integrated circuit device 20 having a plurality of combinational circuits 11, 12, 8 at least one input memory circuit F F₁₁, F F₃₁, F F₃₂, F F₁₃, F F₂₃, F F₃₃ connected to an input side of the combinational circuits, and an output memory circuit F F₂₃, F F₂₅, F F₃₃ connected to an output side of the combinational circuits is disclosed in which an input diagnostic signal is selectively applied to at least one input memory circuit F F₁₁, F F₃₁ connected to a given one 11 of the combinational circuits, to read out a diagnostic signal stored in an output memory circuit F F₂₃ connected to the given combinational circuit 11 . Further, an integrated circuit device is disclosed which is suited to be diagnosed in the above method.
