In a preferred aspect the invention provides a process, as hereinbefore defined, for preparing a compound of formula I above, or a stereoisomer thereof, whereinR1 is an alkyl group containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms or is halophenyl, R2 is hydrogen or methyl R3 is an alkyl group containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms and Y is N or CH . The salts can be salts with inorganic or organic acids eg. hydrochloric, nitric, sulphuric, acetic, 4toluenesulphonic o oxalic acid. The esters are suitably alkanoates eg. acetates with the R3 group suitably alkyl eg. methyl or ethyl , aryl eg. phenyl or aralkyl eg. benzyl .
