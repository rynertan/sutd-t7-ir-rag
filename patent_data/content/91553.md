# Non intrusive thermal power and method.

## Abstract
1. An improved non intrusive thermal power monitor for determining thermal power contribution to a fluid stream from an unknown thermal power source or sink, the monitor comprising a thermal power reference device means adapted to add or remove a known amount of heat to or from a fluid stream flowing through a fluid carrying conduit without intruding into the fluid or conduit b first non intrusive temperature differential measuring means for measuring a first temperature differential across the power reference device and generating an electrical signal which is a function of the first temperature differential c second non intrusive temperature differential measuring means for measuring a temperature differential across a portion of the fluid stream that contains an unknown thermal power source that adds thermal power to the stream or an unknown thermal power sink that extracts thermal power from the stream, the second temperature differential measuring means generating an electrical signal which is a function of the second temperature differential d means for determining the heat capacity rate of the fluid from the first temperature differential signal and the known amount of heat and e means for determining the thermal power introduced into or removed from the fluid by the unknown source or sink from the heat capacity rate and the second temperature differential signal.
