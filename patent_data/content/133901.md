# Toner replenishment and cartridge package system.

## Abstract
A bottom dumping xerographic toner cartridge 26 is protected by a storage and shipping package having stra tegically located zipper perforations, and a tuck flap 22 . One end of the package is removable by virtue of certain zipper perforations. Removal of this end, and operation of other zipper perforations, results in the tuck flap 22 being exposed for use in mounting the package on the reproduc tion device 27, 28, 29, 100 whose toner supply is to be replenished. The toner cartridge 26 is then moved out of the package, into the reproduction device. The now empty package remains supported in a position to catch the toner cartridge s traveling fold seal, and any toner which may be transported out of the cartridge on the face of the seal.
