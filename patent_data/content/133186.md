# Shift valve for automatic transmission.

## Abstract
A shift valve 24 comprises a spool 224 having a downshift position for establishing a lower speed ratio and an upshift position for establishing a higher speed ratio, a plug 225 , and a spring between the spool and plug. The spool has a pressure acting area 224d which governor pressure acts on, while the plug has a pressure acting area 124a which throttle pressure acts on. At low throttle pres sures, the spool moves from the downshift position to the upshift position when a predetermined vehicle speed is attained. At higher throttle pressures, the spool moves be tween the downshift and upshift position depending upon the governor pressure. The shift valve has a port 124b formed therein which admits a downshift position hold sig nal fluid pressure i.e., line pressure between the spool and plug so as to hold the spool to the downshift posiiton thereof.
