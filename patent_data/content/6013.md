# Data capture device by which handwritten alphanumeric characters are couverted to machine readable digital code.

## Abstract
A handwriting recognition device 2 comprises a transducer surface responsive to a pen positioned thereon for representing the coordinate position of the pen as an electrical signal, and data processing means for recognising a handwriting effected with the pen, the data processing means including a microprocessor based control controlling a read write memory, a non volatile read only memory storing a handwriting recognition routine to store recognised handwriting in the read write memory, and an interface communicating to a host computer system a representation of the recognised handwriting. A visual display 6 may be provided coupled to a display interface and an input interface for receiving verified recognised handwriting communicated from the host computer system. The read write memory has a first storage location coupled to the transducer storing a representation of signals from the transducer, a second storage location coupled to the interface and storing a representation of recognised handwriting, and a third storage location coupled to the display interface and storing an image of the display.
