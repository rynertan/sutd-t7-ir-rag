# Container superior in crack resistance.

## Abstract
A multi layered packaging container superior in crack resistance, said container being made up of an outer layer of thermoplastic resin and an inner layer of saponified product of ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer characterized in that the ethylene content is 25 to 60 mol , the degree of saponifica tion of the vinyl acetate component is higher than 96 mol , the melt viscosity index is lower than 1, the specific gravity d is in the range specified by the formula 1 below, and Y₁ and Y₂ are in the range specified by the formula 2 below 1.274 4.4 10 ³X d 1.332 4.4 10 ³X 1 Y₁ Y₂ 1 2 where d is the specific gravity of EVOH resin at 25 C, X is the ethylene content mol of EVOH resin, and Y₁ and Y₂ are the melt viscosity indexes of the thermoplastic resin and the saponified product of ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer, respectively.
