# Planting machine.

## Abstract
A machine for transplanting soil plugs with great unifor mity and a minimum of manual labor comprising a conveyor having a plurality of soil plug gripping mechanisms mounted thereto, a furrow opening device, and a furrow closing device. The furrow closing device of the present invention is prefer ably defined by portions of a bed shaper that operates to form the soil into a trapezoidal planting bed. In addition to the normal function of shaping the bed, the bed shaper estab lishes a ground level with respect to which the plugs are planted, while the rear portions of the bed shaper act to close the furrow, and include adjustable tabs that may be set to control the timing of the closure relative to the plug position ing. Each plug gripping assembly preferably comprises a center opening clip having opposed resilient fingers. The conveyor path is characterized by a lower horizontal path portion that maintains the plugs at the proper planting depth for a significant interval so that the soil may be properly closed around the plugs before the plugs are released.
