# Method of engine control.

## Abstract
A sensor 170 for detecting the internal pressure is pro vided in the cylinder to detect the combusting condition in the engine cylinder. In order to process the output of the sensor 170 in accordance with the volume of the combus tion chamber, the amount of change of combustion volume between timings of fetching the sensor outputs is multiplied by the sensor output, or the sensor output is fetched in ac cordance with the amount of change of combustion volume. In this way, the amount of work is detected from the sensor output. The ignition timing is subjected to feedback control in such a manner as to attain the maximum effective amount of work.
