## Description
The present invention relates to a tympanic isopressor intended for the treatment of the hypacusia deafness of the acoustical transmission middle ear . Till now, this treatment was performed by means of an enema or rubber syringe of Politzer, which was invented in the past century by the Viennese otorhinolaryngologist of the same name. With this device it was tried to attain the proper pressure, substantially through the Eustachian tube, into the eardrum. Said device is based on the use of a rubber syringe through the compression of which a supply of air at a fixed pressure, depending on the force by which the rubber syringe is distorted, is obtained. As a consequence the above mentioned device has the drawback that it supplies a discontinuous pressure, low and uncontrollable and not measurable, being applied manually. Therefore it is practically impossible the introduction into the Eustachian tube of a continuous appropriate treatment. The object of the present invention is to provide a device having a simple construction, operation and handling, so that it can be used by the otorhinolaryngologist or by the patient himself. Further, the device according to the invention has a reduced cost and its operation is fast and effective. By means of the isopressor according to the invention the administration is obtained at a constant pressure, measurable at any time, and which allows the administrtion or the removal at any time of the dressing. According to the present invention, the isopressor comprises an air compressor having a low capacity, driven by an electric motor a tubular tank for the compressed air, coupled with the compressor, and an outlet opening connected with the tank. The compressor, besides being of low capacity, should not work with oil in order to avoid iatrogenic problems avoid the introduction of oil droplets into the ear . Another object of the present invention is to realize an isopressor having subsidiary elements, comprising a microcomputer, that enable the increase of the performance, support the applied treatment and simplify the handling. The isopressor according to the invention comprises, in the air inlet to the compressor, a filter for the particles, and the outlet of said compressor comprises another filter of the dry type, for the removal of solid and liquid particles. The compressor is fed by electric energy from the domestic network and is of the membrane type, in order to avoid the possible existence of oil, that can be dangerous for the patient to be treated. On the other hand, the membrane type compressors usually have a low pressure 3.5 kg cmÂ² max. , which results in a lower risk for the patients and the user, in case of a failure of the pressure control. The filter at the outlet from the compressor includes a blow off valve to eliminate the water collected into the filter during the filtrtion, which is accessible from outside the equipment so to eliminate the liquid. Through the dry filter, air is introduced in a reservoir placed for this, whose inner pressure increases as the compressor operates. In the air reservoir three air intakes are provided The air outlet from the reservoir is connected from the control panel of the device or front of the same to the applicator which is formed by a small deposit or accumulator which accomplishes the double function of applicator and pressure regulator. At the opposite end of the connection of the air pipe, there is a restriction upon which the detachable nozzle for the direct application to the patient is placed. Above the casing of the applicator is placed a push button which when actuated causes the opening of the discharge valve in the form an istantaneous discharge operation. For a precise control of the operation of the device a microcomputer is used as the most modern and dependable electronic means, which carries out the control functions aided by the complementary circuitry as described in the following As an example of a non limiting embodiment, an actual assembling, which will allow a better understanding of the invention, will be described and illustraded in the enclosed drawings, in which As can be seen in figure 1, the isopressor comprises a compressor M having a low capacity, actuated by means of an electrico motor connectable to the network through a cable and a corresponding plug. At the outlet of the compressor M a pressure gauge, indicating the pressure of the air supplied, is provided, as well a pressure reducer or a pressure reducing valve V. The device comprises further a filter for the separation of the possible particles which can be entrained by the air supplied by the compressor M. At the exit of the filter F a flexible and resistant hose A is connected, at whose free end an exhaust valve 13 is plugged, having the shape of a manual spray run, for example. The outlet of the valve is connected to a flexible hose ending with a nozzle 15 for the administration of the treatment. The hose will have a sufficient length to allow the required mobility of the nozzle and the gun and to have at the same time the function of a pressurized air accumulator, in order to have at any moment the availability of pressurized air for its supply through the nozzle in a continuous way or as blasts. In the circuit between the compressor and the gun a volume containing the treatment to be administred can be placed. In figure 2 it is shown a pneumatic diagram of the device. The compressor M operates when it is fed with electric current through the connection P 2 from the control equipment with microcomputer. It receives the air through the filter F 1, compresses the same and directs it in the second dry filter F 2, which includes a blow off valve S for the water, which is accessible from the exterior, in order to separate the water condensed during its operation. From the dry filter it goes to the reservoir D, into which the air is accumulated at the pressure manually selected in the regulator R the excess air is automatically expelled from the outlet 2 of the regulator in order to mantain inside the reservoir a constant pressure. To the reservoir a sensor or transductor S is connected, which receives an excitation current from the electronic control circuits, to which it sends as well the transducer signals through the cables P 1. With this sensor the pressure inside the reservoir is continuously measured with a precision higher than with the pressure gauge of the mechanical type. At the outlet of the air reservoir the exhaust valve V is arranged, which has the function of transferring the compressed air to the air accumulator A arranged in this case in the same applicator, in the other end of which a mouth 1 is arranged, which receives the nozzle for the nose treatment. To the exhaust valve arrives the operating voltage through the conductions of electricity P 3, from the control circuits. This valve will remain permanently open during the operation in continuous discharge, and opens only during the time of actution upon a push button placed on the applicator, when the device must operate with an instantaneous discharge. In figure 3 a block diagram of the electronic control circuit is illustrated. With P the microcomputer bloc is illustrated in this are housed the CPU C, a memory bloc EPROM N and a Lach for the reading out of programs and interpretations. To the microcomputer arrive instructions and signals. There arrive instructions relating to the operation mode for the continuous discharge or the instantaneous discharge, both coming from a simple switch identified as SW1. There arrives a discharge instruction according to the operations as a continuous discharge through the closing of a push button identified as SW2 and arranged into the accumulator or in this case the applicator identified as A in figure 1. The arriving signals come from the pressure sensor or pressure voltage trasductor, for which a spacing bridge is used, fed with constant current from the circuit identified as AO, and in turn the bridge supplies a voltage, as a function of said current and of the internal pressure of the reservoir, to the same circuit, that supplies it after its convenient amplification and stabilization to an analogic to digital converter, which renders it assimilable for the microcomputer. The signal from the sensor and the sensibilization current are fed through the conductors identified as P 1 between AO and S. The digital signal at the exit of converter AD is identified by the microcomputer which transforms it in readable digits in the numerical indicator U, in this case identified as seven segment digits. In its peripheral circuitry, the microcomputer is provided with every auxiliary means usual in these devices, such as quart crystal, impedance adapters and discrete components etc. The auxiliary means of the microcomputer and of the circuits illustrated in blocs consisting in integrated circuits and discrete components of common use will not be represented since there are different single ebomdiments which bring to the same results and are of convential use in electronics. Subject to the instructions received and the above mentioned operation modes, the microcomputer acts upon relays or transformation devices of instructions in power signal through which, as represented in figure 2, the compressor and the solenoid valve are actuated. In the case of the compressor, this will be actuated through the power circuit RM and the electric line P 2. In the case of the exhaust solenoid valve, this will be actuated through the power circuit RV and the line P 3. According to how the operation switch SW1 has been actuated, a luminous indicator LM will light to signal the continuous discharge or LV to signal the instantaneous discharge. All the group of above mentioned circuits is fed through the electric network R by means of an input source F, in which the different voltages of direct current G 1, G 2 and G 3 are produced, comprising the intrinsic elements of input sources for stabilized direct current.
