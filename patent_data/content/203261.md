# IMPROVED KEYBOARD APPARATUS AND PROCESS FOR MAKING SAME

## Abstract
An embodiment of a non contact electrical keyboard switch which completely resists EMI and eliminates cross talk comprises a pair of electrically insulating substrates having rows and columns of openings therethrough. A poled piezoelectric PVDF film is adhered to each substrate over the openings. The films have silk screened ground elec trodes deposited on one surface and signal generating key electrodes deposited on the other surface in registration with the openings. Leads connecting individual rows of key electrodes on one film and individual columns of key elec trodes on other film are disposed orthogonally. An insulat ing sheet separates the films which have their key electrode surfaces facing each other. Leads are connected to ground and or suitable electrical connectors to provide the key board switch. Processes are disclosed for fabricating em bodiments of the keyboard switch.
