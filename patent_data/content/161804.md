## Description
METHOD FOR MODIFYING THE SURFACE OF POLYMER MATERIALS The present invention relates to a method for modifying the surface of polymer materials by adding a specifically limited block copolymer to the polymer materials. More particularly, the present invention relates a method for modifying the surface of a polymer material, wherein a specifically limited block copolymer consisting of a polymer portion compatible with the polymer material and a polymer portion containing per fluoroalkylene groups or per fluoroalkyl groups in the specification and claims, the terms per fluoroalkylene and per fluoroalkyl mean perfluoroalkylene or fluoroalkylene, and perfluoroalkyl or fluoroalkyl, respectively , is added to the polymer material to give to the surface of the polymer material permanently durable corrosion resistance, solvent resistance, chemical resistance, anti blocking property, low frictional property, stain resistance, water repellency, oil repellency, weather resistance and the like, which are inherent properties to the per fluoroalkylene group or per fluoroalkyl group. It has been known that fluorine containing polymers have excellent properties, such as heat resistance, corrosion resistance, low friction, water repellency, oil repellency and the like. These excellent properties are based on the reason that fluorine containing polymers have a strong bonding force between fluorine atoms and carbon atoms due to the high electronegativity of fluorine atom, and further have a low intramolecular cohesive force and a very low surface tension due to the low polarization degree of fluorine atoms. A large number of polymer materials, which contain neither per fluoroalkylene groups nor per fluoroalkyl groups, have not such excellent properties, and these properties are inherent to fluorine containing polymers themselves. Recently, it has been variously attempted to give the above described excellent properties of fluorine containing polymer to the surface of polymer material corresponding to the improvement of the level of properties demanded in the polymer material. There are following 3 groups in the conventional methods for giving the excellent properties of fluorine containing polymer to the surface of polymer material. In the first group methods, the surface of a polymer material is coated with a compound containing per fluoroalkyl groups or per fluoroalkylene groups. For example, the processing of textiles by the use of fluorine resin has recently been prevailed.Japanese Patent Laid open Specification Nos. 9,619 80, 29,501 80, 45,756 80, 59,277 83 and 118,833 83 disclose methods for giving water repellency and oil repellency to textile surface, wherein the textile surface is coated with a random copolymer produced from a perfluoroalkyl group containing acrylic or methacrylic acid ester used as an essential component and a vinyl monomer copolymerizable therewith. Further, Japanese PatentApplication Publication No. 11,324 82 proposes a method for giving water repellency and oil repellency to the surface of polymer materials, such as textile, polyester film and the like, wherein the polymer material surface is coated with a fluorine containing polyester synthesized by the reaction of fluoro olefin epoxide with a cyclic acid anhydride. In the second group methods, per fluoroalkyl groups or per fluoroalkylene groups are chemically bonded to a polymer material to give the characteristic properties inherent to the per fluoroalkyl or per fluoroalkylene groups to the surface of the polymer material. For example, it has been attempted to give water repellency, oil repellency, weather resistance and stain resistance inherent to per fluoroalkylene groups or per fluoroalkyl groups to a coating film surface.Japanese Patent Laid open SpecificationNos. 3,407 82 and 3,408 82 disclose that a random copolymer produced from a fluoro olefin used as a main component and a vinyl monomer copolymerizable with the fluoro olefin forms a coating film having excellent weather resistance, and further Japanese Patent Laid openSpecification No. 136,666 83 discloses that the above described coating film is effective as a stainproofing film in water. Japanese Patent Laid open SpecificationNos. 34,866 83 and 34,867 83 disclose that a random copolymer produced from a per fluoroalkyl groupcontaining acrylic acid ester or methacrylic acid ester used as a main component and a vinyl monomer copolymerizable therewith forms a coating film having excellent weather resistance, water repellency, oil repellency and stain resistance.Further, Japanese Patent Laid openSpecification No. 11,572 82 discloses that a hardened epoxy resin film synthesized from a resin having epoxy groups as a functional group and an amine or diamine having perfluoroalkyl groups exhibits water repellency and oil repellency. In the third group methods, a fluorinecontaining compound is added to a polymer material to give characteristic properties inherent to the fluorinecontaining compound to the surface of the polymer material. For example, in Japanese Patent Laid openSpecification Nos. 14,648 82 and 192,445 82, a per fluoroalkyl group containing surfactant is added to a vinyl chloride resin film.Polymer Bullutin, Vol. 5, 335 1981 and Japanese Patent Laid open SpecificationNo. 179,246 82 disclose methods for giving water repellency and oil repellency to the surface of polymethyl methacrylate, wherein a vinyl polymerizable double bond is added to one end of the molecular chain of polymethyl methacrylate to produce a macromonomer, the macromonomer is copolymerized with an acrylic acid ester having perfluoroalkyl groups to synthesize a graft copolymer having branches consisting of polymethyl methacrylate and a backbone consisting of perfluoroalkyl group containing acrylic acid esters arranged in sequence, and the resulting graft copolymer is added to the polymethyl methacrylate. However, the above described methods for modifying polymer material surface have the following drawbacks. That is, in the first group methods, a component having a compatibility with polymer material forms a random copolymer or polycondensate, and hence the random copolymer or polycondensate containing fluorine atoms has not a satisfactorily high affinity to the polymer material, and cannot modify permanently the polymer material surface. In the second group methods, when the amount of fluorine containing monomers constituting a fluorinecontaining polymer is very small, the fluorine containing polymer cannot give the properties inherent to per fluoroalkyl group or per fluoroalkylene group to polymer material surface. As the amount of fluorinecontaining monomers constituting a fluorine containing polymer increases, there appears the effect of the fluorine containing polymer for modifying polymer material surface, and moreover the durability of the modifying effect for the polymer material surface increases. However, a high cost is required in the production of the fluorine containing polymer, and moreover it is difficult to give the property of fluorine free monomer, which is used as another component for constituting the fluorine containing polymer, to the fluorine containing polymer. The third group methods have the following drawbacks. In the method wherein a fluorine containing surfactant is added to a polymer material to be modified, the surfactant bleeds out to the surface of the polymer material, and cannot permanently modify the polymer material surface. In the method, wherein a fluorinecontaining graft copolymer is used, the synthesis of the graft copolymer is complicated, and moreover the molecular weight of the macromonomer must be kept to a relatively low molecular weight number average molecular weight 1,000 10,000 in order to maintain its reactivity for polymerization, and therefore the polymethyl methacrylate portion, which forms the branch of the graft copolymer, is an oligomer having a number average molecular weight of not larger than 10,000.Accordingly, when such graft copolymer is added to polymethyl methacrylate in order to modify it, the graft copolymer cannot be always fully catched in the polymethyl methacrylate due to the low molecular weight of the polymethyl methacrylate portion in the branch, and therefore it is doubtful that the graft copolymer is permanently effective for modifying the surface of the polymethyl methacrylate. As described above, the surface of polymer material has not yet been fully and satisfactorily modified in an industrially easy method. Bearing these problems in mind, the inventors have made various investigations and found out a surprising effect that, when a polymer material to be modified is coated or mixed with a specifically limited block copolymer consisting of a polymer portion having per fluoroalkyl groups or per fluoroalkylene groups hereinafter, refer to as a fluorine containing polymer portion and a polymer portion having a compatibility with the polymer material, the surface of the polymer material can be easily, conspicuously and permanently modified in an industrial scale. As the result, the present invention has been accomplished.

The block polymer of the present invention can be easily produced by using the above described polymeric peroxide or polyazo compound in an ordinary bulk polymerization process, suspension polymerizaton process, solution polymerization process or emulsion polymerization process. The polymerization mechanism in the production of the block copolymer of the present invention can be explained as follows, for example, in the case where a vinyl monomer which forms a fluorinefree polymer portion is used in the first step, and a vinyl monomer which forms a fluorine containing polymer portion is used in the second step.That is, when a vinyl monomer which forms a fluorine free polymer is polymerized in the presence of a polymeric peroxide or polyazo compound, a vinyl polymer having peroxy bonds or azo bonds in its molecular chain is firstly obtained, and when the resulting peroxy bond or azo bond containing vinyl polymer is polymerized together with a fluorine containing vinyl monomer which forms a fluorine containing polymer portion, the peroxy bondor azo bond containing vinyl polymer is cleaved at the peroxy bonds or azo bonds contained therein, and an aimed block copolymer is obtained in very efficiently. In the present invention, the fluorinecontaining block copolymer may be obtained by a method, wherein a block copolymer is synthesized according to the above described method by the use of an epoxy group containing vinyl monomer in place of a fluorinecontaining vinyl monomer, and the block copolymer is reacted with a carboxylic acid or alcohol containing per fluoroalkyl groups or per fluoroalkylene groups. In the production of the block copolymer of the present invention, the amount of a polymeric peroxide or a polyazo compound to be used in the first step is 0.5 20 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of a vinyl monomer to be used in the first step, the polymerization temperature is about 60 1300C and the polymerization time is about 2 10 hours. The polymerization reaction in the second step is carried out under a condition of a polymerization temperature of about 60 1400C and a polymerization time of about 3 15 hours. The weight ratio of the fluorinefree polymer portion to the fluorine containing polymer portion in a block copolymer is preferably 1 19 19 1, more preferably 1 9 9 1. A block copolymer having a weight ratio of fluorine containing polymer portion to fluorine free polymer portion of less than 1 19 is poor in the effect for modifying the surface of polymer material, and a block copolymer having a weight ratio of fluorine free polymer portion to fluorine containing polymer portion of less than 1 19 is poor in the compatibility with the polymer material, and it is difficult to maintain permanently the effect for modifying the surface of polymer material. The polymer material to be modified in its surface in the present invention includes resin, fabrics and rubber made of synthetic polymer and natural polymer, such as plastics, paint, textile, film, cloth, sealant, and further all materials made of polymer. As the synthetic polymer material, there can be mentioned polyacrylic resin, polyvinyl chloride resin, polyvinylidene chloride resin, polystyrene resin, ABS resin, styrene butadiene resin, AS resin, polyethylene resin, polypropylene resin, chlorinated polyethylene resin, chlorinated polypropylene resin, polyamide resin, polyester resin, epoxy resin, polyphenylene oxide resin, polycarbonate resin, modified polypropylene oxide resin, polyurethane resin, nitrocellulose resin, cellulose acetate resin, ethylcellulose resin, cellulose acetate butyrate resin, cellulose acetate propionate resin, ethylene vinyl acetate resin, urea resin, melamine resin, polyvinyl ether resin, petroleum resin, coumarone resin, indene resin, phenolic resin, acetal resin, acrylonitrile butadiene rubber, chloroprene rubber, acrylic rubber, butyl rubber, polybutadiene rubber, polyisoprene rubber, ethylenepropylene diene rubber, polyacrylic fiber, nylon fiber, polyester fiber, polyvinyl alcohol fiber, polyvinyl chloride fiber, polyvinylidene chloride fiber, polyethylene fiber, polypropylene fiber, polyurethane fiber and polyvinyl acetal fiber. As the natural polymer material, there can be mentioned rosin, natural rubber, cotton, linen, wool and silk. As the methods for adding the specifically limited block copolymer of the present invention to the above polymer material, there can be used a method, wherein a solution or dispersion of the specifically limited block copolymer in a solvent is coated on the surface of the polymer material a method wherein the block copolymer is mixed with a polymer material during its forming, or the block copolymer is dissolved in a solvent together with a polymer material, and then the mixture of the block copolymer and the polymer material is formed into a film a method wherein the block copolymer is previously formed into a sheet, and the block copolymer sheet is pressed and adhered to a polymer material surface at a high temperature or is adhered to the surface by means of an adhesive a method wherein powders of the block copolymer as such is welded to a polymer material surface and the like.The addition amount of the block copolymer to a polymer material is preferably within the range of 0.01 30 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the polymer material. When the addition amount is less than 0.01 part by weight, the effect of the block copolymer of the present invention does not fully appear, and when the addition amount exceeds 30 parts by weight, the characteristic properties inherent to polymer material may be lost. The block copolymer of the present invention can be added alone to a polymer material to be modified, but may be added to the polymer material together with commonly known surfactants. The use amount of the surfactant is preferably 0 50 by weight based on the amount of the block copolymer of the present invention.When the amount of the surfactant is larger than 50 by weight, the effect of the present invention does not fully appear. The method of the present invention, wherein the surface of a polymer material is modified by adding the above described specifically limited block copolymer to the polymer material, has the following merits.That is, properties, such as corrosion resistance, solvent resistance, chemical resistance, anti blocking property, low frictional property, stain resistance, water repellency, oil repellency, weather resistance and the like, can be given to the surface of various polymer materials by the action characteristic of the fluorine containing polymer portion, particularly by the characteristic of the per fluoroalkylene group or per fluoroalkyl group of the block copolymer, and moreover the above described effect can be maintained in the polymer material for a long period of time by the characteristic of the polymer portion having a compatibility with the polymer material. The method of the present invention not only can be used in textile, clothing, leather, paint and the like, but also can be expected to be used as an improver for the adaptability of medical plastics to living body.

It can be seen from Tables 10 and 11 that the block copolymer of the present invention can give water repellency, oil repellency, chemical resistance, stain resistance and weather resistance to an acrylic resin, and the cured film of the acrylic resin is superior in these properties than the cured film of an acrylic resin Comparative examples which does not contain the block copolymer or contains a fluorine containing polymer other than the block copolymer.Reference example 24 A Production of an azo bond containing polymer Into a reactor equipped with a thermometer, a stirrer and a reflux condenser was charged 90 parts of N,N dimethylformamide, and while blowing nitrogen gas into the reactor and heating the reaction system at 700C, a mixed solution consisting of N,N dimetylformamide 30 parts methyl methacrylate 15 partsEMI82.1 15 parts 8 parts was charged into the reactor in 2 hours, and a polymerization reaction was further effected for 2 hours.The resulting solution was a transparent solution containing 23.2 of an azo bond containing polymer and having a viscosity of 1.6 poises at 250C. B Production of a block copolymer In an autoclave equipped with a thermometer and a stirrer, a mixed solution consisting of 130 parts of the N,N dimethylformamide solution of azo bondcontaining polymer obtained in the above describedStep A , which had been cooled to 300C by a dry ice methyl alcohol freezing mixture, 30 parts of polyvinyl chloride and 40 parts of N,N dimethylformamide was heated at 700C for 10 hours under pressure while blowing nitrogen gas into the reactor, to effect a block copolymerization reaction and to obtain a milk white dispersion conaining 29.5 of a block copolymer and having a vicosity of 2.9 poises at 250C. The resulting dispersion was poured into 2 Q of water while stirring vigorously the resulting mixture, to precipitate the copolymer, and then the precipitate was filtered and dried to obtain the block copolymer.Examples 12 and 13 A mixture of 100 parts of acrylonitrilebutadiene rubber with 5 parts of the block copolymer produced in the above Reference example 24, Step B , or a mixture of 100 parts of polyisoprene rubber with 5 parts of the block copolymer produced in the above Reference example 14 was kneaded in a roll and formed into a sheet having a thickness of 1 mm. The resulting sheet was free from both coloration and bleeding, and had a good processability. The surface physical properties surface adhesion and stain resistance of the sheets were measured according to the test method described inExamples 1 3 namely, under the condition described in the footnote of Table 3 .

It can be seen from Table 12 that the surface of a rubber sheet containing the block copolymer of the present invention is superior in the anti blocking property and stain resistance to the surface of a rubber sheet not containing the block copolymer Comparative examples 16 and 17 . Moreover, the effect for modifying the rubber surface does not substantially change even in the friction of the surface, and is permanent.Examples 14 and 15 The block copolymer produced in the aboveReference example 24, Step B , or the block copolymer synthesized in the above Reference example 9 was added to a rigid polyvinyl chloride resin sold by Toa goseiChemical Industry Co., Ltd., trademark TS 700 , which consisted of 70 parts of polyvinyl chloride resin and 30 parts of 2 ethylhexyl phthalate, in a mixing ratio shown in the following Table 13, and the rigid polyvinyl chloride resin containing the block copolymer was kneaded in and extruded through an extruder into a sheet, and the sheet was press molded into a sheet having a thickness of 5 mm. The effect of the block copolymer for preventing the bleeding out of 2 ethylhexyl phthalate to the sheet surface was measured by the following method.That is, a polyethylene terephthalate sheet PET sheet of 30mmx 3 Ommx 5mm and the above described polyvinyl chloride resin sheet were put between 2 Teflon sheets, and after the assembly was left to stand for 4 hours at 700C under a load of 300 g, a force g required for peeling perpendicularly the PET sheet from the polyvinyl chloride resin sheet was measured. When the bleeded amount of 2 ethylhexyl phthalate is larger, the adhesive force is higher. The obtained results are shown in Table 13. Further, the block copolymer synthesized in the above Reference example 24, Step B or in the above Reference example 9 was dispersed in acetone to form an acetone dispersion containing 5 by weight of the block copolymer, and the acetone dispersion was applied to a polyvinyl chloride resin sheet, which contained 30 by weight of 2 ethylhexyl phthalate and had a thickness of 5 mm, and had previously been washed with methanol, by means of a sprayer so that a block copolymer film having a thickness of about 20 ijm would be formed after drying. After the applied dispersion was dried at room temperature for 10 hours, the effect of the block copolymer for preventing the bleeding out of 2 ethylhexyl phthalate to the sheet surface was measured in the same method as described above. Further, after the sheet surface was washed with city water at 250C for 10 hours at a flow rate of 2 mien, the effect of the block copolymer for preventing the bleeding out of 2 ethylhexyl phthalate was measured. The obtained results are shown in Table 14.Comparative example 18 A polyvinyl chloride resin sheet having a thickness of 5 mm was produced in the same manner as described in Exampls 14 and 15, except that the block copolymer was not added to the rigid polyvinyl chloride resin. The bleeding out of 2 ethylhexyl phthalate to the sheet surface was measured in the same manner as described in Examples 14 and 15. The obtained results are shown in Tables 13 and 14.Comparative example 19 A methyl methacrylate film was formed on a polyvinyl chloride resin sheet in the same manner as described in Examples 14 and 15 in place of forming a block copolymer film. The effect of methyl methacrylate for preventing the bleeding out of 2 ethylhexyl phthalate to the sheet surface was measured in the same manner as described in Examples 14 and 15.

It can be seen from Tables 13 and 14 that the bleeding out of 2 ethylhexyl phthalate contained in polyvinyl chloride resin is prevented by adding the block copolymer to the polyvinyl chloride resin. Moreover, it is clear from Table 14 that this effect is distinctly superior to that attained by forming methyl methacrylate film on a polyvinyl chloride resin sheet, and that this effect does not substantially change even in the washing with city water.Reference example 25 Into an autoclave of 1 Q capacity, made of glass and equipped with a stirrer, were charged stearyl methacrylate 40 partsN methylolacrylamide .. 4 partsEMI91.1 10 parts n 20 methyl ethyl ketone 100 parts isopropyl alcohol 60 parts and the resulting mixture was fully stirred while introducing nitrogen gas into the autoclave. Then, 40 parts of polyvinyl chloride was charged into the autoclave under pressure, and the autoclave was gradually heated up to 650C, and kept at 650C for 6 hours to carry out a polymerization reaction.Successively, a mixed solution consisting of C12F25CH2CH2OCOCH CH2 40 parts CloF2lCH2CH2OCOCH CH2 . 40 parts C8F17CH2CH2OCOCH CH2 . 40 parts and methyl ethyl ketone 80 parts was added dropwise to the polymerization reaction solution in 3 hours, and a polymerization reaction was further effected at 80 C for 5 hours to obtain a white dispersion containing about 48 of a block copolymer as a solid content.Then, 100 parts of the above obtained block copolymer dispersion was charged into a four neck flask, and while keeping the reaction system at 500C, a mixed solution consisting of hydroxyethyl cellulose 0.5 part sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate 1.0 part and water 150 parts was added dropwise to the block copolymer dispersion to obtain a white emulsion.Examples 16 and 17 The emulsion obtained in the above Reference example 25 was diluted with water to produce a dispersion containing 5 of the block copolymer as a solid content, and a cotton cloth or a polyester textile was immersed in the dispersion for 2 minutes. Then, the cotton cloth or polyester textile was squeezed at a wet pick up of 85 between two rubber rollers, dried at 1000C for 3 minutes and then heat treated at 1700C for 1 minute. The water repellency, oil repellency and surface frictional property of the above treated cotton cloth and polyester textile were measured by the method described in the footnote of Table 15. Further, the cotton cloth and polyester textile were washed according to JIS L0217, Washing method No. 103, and these properties of the washed samples were measured. The obtained results are shown in Table 15.Comparative examples 20 and 21 The water repellency, oil repellency and surface frictional property of a cotton cloth and a polyester textile, which had not been immersed in the aqueous dispersion of the block copolymer, were measured in the same manner as described in Example 16.
