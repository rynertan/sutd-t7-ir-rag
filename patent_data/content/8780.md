# Aqueous coating composition for providing enteric coatings on solid dosage forms and method for applying it to solid dosage forms.

## Abstract
A novel aqueous coating composition is proposed for providing enteric coating on solid dosage forms such as tab lets. The aqueous coating composition of the invention com prises a fine powder of an enterosoluble cellulose derivative such as hydroxypropylmethylcellulose phthalate and hyd roxypropylmethylcellulose acetate succinate, which is insol uble in water but can be plasticized and solubilized with cer tain plasticizing agents, as dispersed in an aqueous dispers ing medium and a plasticizing agent having compatibility with the enterosoluble cellulose derivative and dissolved in the aqueous dispersing medium. The particle size of the enterosoluble cellulose derivative and the boiling point of the plasticizing agent is the key parameters and should be finer than 100 Âµm in an average particle diameter and not lower than 100 C, respectively. Upon application of the aqueous coating composition to the solid dosage forms, water as the dispersing medium is first evaporated leaving the cellulose derivative and the plasticizing agent, which latter solubilizes the former to form a continuous coating layer on the solid dosage forms imparting good and satisfactory enterosolubil ity thereto.
