# PUNCH PRESS WITH A NUMBER OF SELECTABLE PUNCHES

## Abstract
Between a plurality of side by side punches 46 and an operating slide 27 having reciprocating motion is arranged a selective motion transmission device 8 which consists of two pluralities of toothed couplings 44, 45 in mutually opposed positions. The toothed couplings of a first plurality 44 are made integral with the punches 46 while the others 45 follow the reciprocating motion of the slide 27 but are shiftable transversally to it between a neutral position and a working position. In the latter position the teeth of the opposed couplings 44,45 are mutually aligned and thus allow transmission of the reciprocating motion of the slide 27 to the corresponding punches 46.
