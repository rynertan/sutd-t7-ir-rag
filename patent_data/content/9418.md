# GLASS COMPOSITION FOR THE PRODUCTION OF FIBRES

## Abstract
Glass fibres can be produced from molten glass com positions by various fibrisation processes, but each process requires a specifically developed glass composi tion in order to optimise the amount of wastage, the ex pense of the composition, the fluidity and crystallisation tendency of the melt, and the quality heavy weight or light weight and hydrolytic resistance of the glass fibre product. For example, the process giving a light weight product in a high yield requires an expensive composition that cannot readily utilise industrial wastes. The glass composition of the invention is suitable for several processes and can utilise industrial wastes while giving a light weight good quality product. The amounts of all components of the composition are maintained within specified ranges and the weight ratios CaO Na₂O, SiO₂ Al₂O₃, K₂O Na₂O and CaO Na₂O SiO₂ Al₂O₃ are also maintained within given ranges.
