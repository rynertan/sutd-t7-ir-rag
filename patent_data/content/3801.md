# Use of photosensitive stratum to create through hole connections in circuit boards.

## Abstract
Electrically conductive through holes in a substrate 2 are prepared by a laminating a film based plastic photosensitive toner receptive stratum 4 to at least one surface of the substrate b applying a pressure differential across the stratum covering the substrate holes 8 , the outside pressure exceeding that inside the holes 8 in either order c removing at least one film base or d exposing the photosensitive stratum 4 imagewise, e adhering metal or catalytic particles to hole walls and image areas, f optionally hardening or curing the particulate areas and g providing an electrically conductive printed circuit and through holes, e.g., by plating metal electrolessly, soldering or conjoining the metallized or catalyzed areas.
