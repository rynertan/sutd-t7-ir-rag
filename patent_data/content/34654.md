# An apparatus for coating substrates.

## Abstract
The invention relates to an apparatus for sputter deposi tion of tragets on a substrate 26 . The apparatus comprises a vacuum chamber 10 filled with argon and includes, a first electrode 16 supporting target material 18 , a eutectic mat erial 28 disposed between the target material 18 and the first electrode 16 , a second electrode 20 supporting the substrate 26 when voltage is applied to said electrodes, the argon gas ionizes and the target material is deposited on the substrate. The eutectic material such as gallium indium pro vides a floating bond between the target material and the first electrode.
