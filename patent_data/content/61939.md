# THE PROVISION OF CONDUCTORS IN ELECTRONIC DEVICES

## Abstract
Conductor strips 13 required in an electronic device are formed by an electron beam lithography process in which a layer of electron sensitive positive resist is formed on a conductive layer and is selectively exposed by means of an electron beam so as to produce a latent image pattern made up of thin lines 14 whereby the required conductor strips of the device are outlined. The positive resist layer is de veloped, and then etched, so that the pattern of thin lines is etched through the conductive layer. The pattern is such that the remaining material of the conductive layer constitutes not only the required conductor strips but also residual portions that are electrically separated from the required conductor strips.
