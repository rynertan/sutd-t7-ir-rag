# Focussed laser beam optical system.

## Abstract
The focal range of a focussed laser beam optical system is enlarged where the beam has a guassian cross sectional profile. A stop 20 is arranged, after a beam expanding system 22, between the laser 12 producing the beam 10, and a beam focussing lens system 14. The stop is provided with an aperture of predetermiend diameter with respect to that of the laser beam 10 whereby the outer portion of the expanded beam 10 represented by the low intensity skirts of the intensity profile curve 28 is stopped. This arrangement can influence the focal range up to a 75 per cent increase over that obtained with the unexpanded and unstopped beam.
