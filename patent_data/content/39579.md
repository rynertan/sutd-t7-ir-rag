## Abstract
An induced draft combustion apparatus and its associat ed control system has a blower 60 located in the exhaust stack or vent 80 which is used to induce the movement of air and combustion products into, through and out of the com bustion chamber. A flow restricting orifice 70 in the exhaust stack near the blower causes a region of higher pressure to exist upstream from the orifice with a region of lower pressure downstream from the orifice. An exhaust gas pressure signal representative of the exhaust gas volume flow rate is sensed on one side of the orifice and is fed back via line 90 to a modul ating gas valve 100 which controls the outlet gas flow from the valve to be proportional to the magnitude of the exhaust gas volume flow rate. By controlling blower speeds and ex haust gas volume flow capacities as related to a selected ori fice size, various firing rates for the furnace can be selected, from the design maximum down to various derated levels. A temperature sensitive device 300 is provided in the stack and is operable to modify the gas supply valve and hence gas sup ply in dependence upon stack gas temperature so as to compensate for an excess combustion air condition which may occur in the combustion chamber at lower firing rates.
