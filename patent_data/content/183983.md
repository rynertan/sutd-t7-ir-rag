# TOGGLE BOLT ASSEMBLY

## Abstract
A bushing cooperates with a bolt and a winged toggle member to form a toggle bolt assembly. The bushing has a maximum cross sectional dimension substantially equal to the diameter of the hole in the wall or other support member to which the toggle bolt assembly is to fasten an object and an inside diameter permitting passage of the bolt there through. To fasten an object to a wall, the bolt is passed through an opening in the object and through the bushing and threadedly engaged in the toggle member. The toggle member wings are folded, and the toggle member is passed through the hole in the wall until the wings open. The bushing is inserted into the hole and held in place while the bolt is pulled outward until the opened toggle wings abut the inner surface of the wall, inhibiting rotation of the toggle member as a bolt is rotated. The bolt is then threadedly tightened in the toggle member, drawing the object and the wings into further engagement with the opposite surfaces of the wall. The external cross section of the bushing can be substantially circular or can be a non circular, including a fluted cross section or a cross section having a circular main portion with ribs that run longitudinally along the main portion. The bushing central bore can have a radially inwardly extending flange or a plurality of radially inwardly extending fingers at one or both ends, leaving an opening with a minimum cross sectional dimension substantially equal to the root diameter of the bolt so that the bolt is pushed or threaded past the flange or fingers to hold the bushing on the bolt. The bushing can include a restraining collar or a restraining loop engaging the bolt and restraining the winged toggle member from rotating as the bolt is rotated. Thus the bolt can be driven by a screwdriver exerting pressure on the bolt head to urge the bolt head toward the wall, such as a powerdriver or a Yankee screwdriver.
