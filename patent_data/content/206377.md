## Description
The invention relates to a process for the extraction of one or more transition metals from an organic medium. An organic medium containing one or more transition metals may be obtained after chemical reactions in which a catalyst bearing such metals was employed. It is a drawback of the known methods for recovering such metals from organic reaction mixtures that the recovery is incomplete or laborious, particularly if the concentration of such metals in the mixtures is low. It is an object of the present invention to separate said metals in a highly efficient manner from an organic medium. Accordingly, the invention provides a process for the extraction of one or more transition metals from an organic medium, in which process the organic medium is contacted with an aqueous phase in the presence of a cyclic phosphite having a bridgehead phosphorus atom linked to three oxygen atoms at least two of which form together with the bridgehead phosphorus atom part of a ring, said cyclic phosphite having a hydroxymethyl group linked to a ring carbon atom, one or more of the hydrogen atoms in the cyclic phosphite optionally being substituted, so as to obtain an aqueous extract phase containing at least a portion of said metals. It has, surprisingly, been found that highly efficient extractions are possible when the extraction is carried out with a cyclic phosphite as defined hereinbefore. Usually, no transition metal can be detected in the organic raffinate phase which remains after contacting the organic medium with the aqueous phase. According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention one or more metals of Group 8 of the Periodic Table of the Elements are extracted from the organic medium. The Periodic Table of the Elements is that shown on the inside cover of CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 61st edition 1980 1981 . The metals of Group 8 which can be extracted by means of the process according to the present invention are iron, cobalt and nickel and, which are preferred, the noble metals, viz. ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridium and platinum. Very good results have been obtained with rhodium and palladium. Any cyclic phosphite of the type defined hereinbefore may be used, provided it is more readily soluble in water than in the organic medium at the temperature at which the extraction is carried out. According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention the cyclic phosphite is a bicyclic phosphite having the general formula in which each R individually represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group having not more than 3 carbon atoms. Preferably, each R represents a methyl group, or, more preferably, a hydrogen atom. Very good results have been obtained with 4 hydroxymethyl 2,6,7 trioxa 1 phosphabicyclo 2,2,2 octane, this compound and its complexes with said noble metals being highly soluble in water. According to another preferred embodiment of the present invention the cyclic phosphite is a monocyclic phosphite having the general formula in which each R has the same meaning as in formula I and Q represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group having not more than three carbon atoms or a group of the general formula in which R has the same meaning as in formula I . The group in the general formula II is also meant to include the tautomeric structure The cyclic phosphites of the general formulae I and II can be prepared by methods known in the art. They may be prepared in situ, for example from a compound of the general formula I or II in which th e hydrogen atom in the H O C group is replaced with an atom of an alkali metal or an ammonium group or with a mesylate or p tosylate group. The presence of the cyclic phosphite may be brought about in various manners. According to a preferred manner the organic medium is brought into contact with a solution of the cyclic phosphite in a polar solvent, suitably by means of stirring. Stirring is preferably continued until the cyclic phosphite has formed a complex with the metal of Group 8. This usually takes a relatively short time, the metal of Group 8 and the cyclic phosphite being present in one liquid phase, generally after 1 to 150 min. Then, an aqueous phase is added and stirring is continued until equilibrium between the phases has been established. This is generally the case after 1 to 20 min. After phase separation, an aqueous extract phase containing at least a portion of the Group 8 metal and also containing polar solvent and an organic raffinate phase are obtained. The presence of the cyclic phosphite may also be brought about by bringing the organic medium containing the Group 8 metal into contact with an aqueous phase containing dissolved cyclic phosphite, suitably by means of stirring. After phase separation, an aqueous extract phase containing at least a portion of the Group 8 metal and an organic raffinate phase are obtained. According to a further embodiment of the present invention an organic medium containing a Group 8 metal in complex combination with the cyclic phosphite is brought into contact with an aqueous phase, suitably by means of stirring. In this manner, the complex combination is transferred from the organic medium to the aqueous phase. The starting organic medium may contain very little noble metal, yet extraction efficiency is very high. Favourable concentrations of the noble metal values to be extracted are in the range of from 0.01 to 100 mmol l, but concentrations below 0.01 mmol l or above 100 mmol l are not excluded. A favourable volume ratio of the aqueous phase to the organic medium has been found to be in the range of from 0.05 to 2 usually, this volume ratio is lower than 1. However, volume ratios below 0.05 or above 2 are not excluded. The metal may be present in any form in the organic medium, for example as a carbonyl or as a complex of such a carbonyl with other molecules. Any organic medium containing one or more metals of Group 8 of the Periodic Table of the Elements may be used in the process according to the present invention, provided that upon contacting this medium with the aqueous phase an aqueous extract phase and an organic raffinate phase are formed. According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention the organic medium contains rhodium in complex combination with a compound of trivalent phosphorus, which rhodium has been used as a catalyst compound for the preparation of aldehydes by hydroformylation of an ethylenically unsaturated compound with carbon monoxide and hydrogen in the presence of a solvent for the complex combination. Hydroformylation is a known reaction by which an ethylenically unsaturated compound is reacted with hydrogen and carbon monoxide in the presence of a hydroformylation catalyst in this case a rhodium complex to form an aldehyde having one more carbon atom than the starting ethylenically unsaturated compound. This preferred embodiment has the advantage that no rhodium is lost in metallic form and that no shifting of carbon carbon double bonds takes place in unreacted ethylenically unsaturated compound present in the organic medium. Such shifting of carbon carbon double bonds and loss of rhodium often takes place when a reaction mixture obtained by hydroformylation is separated in a known manner by means of distillation to isolate the aldehyde in vaporous form and the complex rhodium catalyst in a liquid residue because this distillation may require relatively high temperatures, depending on the prevailing vapour pressure of the alde hyde. Hydroformylation may be carried out using rhodium in complex combination with the cyclic phosphite described hereinbefore during such hydroformylation very little shifting of carbon carbon double bonds has been observed. Alternatively, hydroformylation may be carried out using rhodium in complex combination with a compound of trivalent phosphorus other than the cyclic phosphite, preferably a phosphine. It has, surprisingly, been found that, even in the presence of a large excess of phosphine, rhodium is very efficiently extracted from the organic medium. Examples of compounds of trivalent phosphorus are triaryl phosphines and triaryl phosphites or mixed aryl aryloxy or mixed aryl alkoxy phosphines and phosphites. The aryl group may be, for example, a phenyl or naphthyl group and may be substituted with, for example, an alkyl group having up to 20 carbon atoms. Examples of suitable compounds are triphenylphosphine, triphenyl phosphite, tri p tolylphosphine, tri p tolyl phosphite, tri alpha naphthylphosphine, tri alpha naphthyl phosphite, tri p biphenyl phosphite, tri p biphenylphosphine, tri o chlorophenyl phosphite and tri o chlorophenylphosphine. Examples of other suitable ligands are those represented by formula III European Patent Application n 96986 describes a process for the production of an aldehyde by hydroformylation of an α olefin using rhodium in complex combination with a cyclic phosphite ligand as cayalyst. Product recovery is achieved in a conventional way the rhodium complex is recovered as an organic solution and may be recycled to the hydroformylation zone. The ethylenically unsaturated compound may have a carbon carbon double bond at an alpha or a non alpha position in the molecule, the former possibility being preferred, the reaction rates being considerably higher. Alpha olefins are usually converted into a mixture of primary and secondary aldehydes, the primary aldehydes being usually the most desirable. Usually, 70 or more of the mixture of aldehydes consists of the former aldehydes. The said preparation of aldehydes is generally applicable to any aliphatic or cycloaliphatic compound having at least one carbon carbon double bond. Thus, it is applicable to olefins having, for example, 2 to 30 carbon atoms per molecule, for example, ethylene, propylene, butylene, cyclohexene, 1 octene, 1 dodecene, 1 octadecene and dihydronaphthalene. Suitable hydrocarbons include both branched and straight chain, as well as cyclic compounds having one or more carbon carbon double bonds. These sites may be conjugated, as in 1,3 butadiene, or non conjugated, as in 1,5 hexadiene or 1,5 bicyclo 2,2,1 heptadiene. In the case of polyolefins, it is possible to hydroformylate only one of the olefinic sites or several or all of these sites. Olefinic hydrocarbon fractions, such as, for example, polymeric olefinic fractions and cracked wax fractions containing substantial proportions of non alpha olefins may be hydro formylated. Such suitable feeds include, for example, C₇, C₈, C₉, C₁₀ and higher olefinic fractions as well as olefinic hydrocarbon fractions of wider boiling ranges such as C Other examples of ethylenically unsaturated compounds which may be hydroformylated are unsaturated alcohols, unsaturated aldehydes and unsaturated acids, which are converted into the corresponding alcohols, aldehydes and acids containing a formyl group on one of the carbon atoms previously involved in the carbon carbon double bond of the starting ethylenically unsaturated compound. Generally, hydroformylation is carried out under rather mild conditions, preferably at a temperature in the range of from 40 C to 160 C and a total pressure in the range of from 1 to 50 bar. Generally, a molar ra tio ligand of formula III to rhodium in the range of from 0.5 to 5000 is used usually, this range is at least 3. The amount of rhodium may vary within wide ranges generally a molar ratio of ethylenically unsaturated compound to rhodium in the range of from 150,000 to 10 and often from 100,000 to 1000 is used. The rhodium may be introduced into the complex combination in any desired manner, for example, as 1,5 cyclooctadiene rhodium I acetate, 1,5 cyclooctadiene rhodium I acetylacetonate, rhodium acetate, dirhodium octacarbonyl, finely divided rhodium metal, rhodium nitrate, tetrarhodium dodecacarbonyl or hexarhodium hexadeca carbonyl. Generally, a molar ratio of hydrogen to carbon monoxide in the range of from 0,5 to 12 is used. The process according to the present invention results if applied to extraction of rhodium used as a catalyst in a hydro formylation reaction upon phase separation, in an organic raffinate phase containing aldehyde, any ligand other than the cyclic phosphite, and, usually, unreacted ethylenically unsaturated compound, and an aqueous extract phase containing rhodium in complex combination with the cyclic phosphite. Suitably, the aqueous extract phase is separated by means of distillation into a distillate fraction containing water and a residual fraction containing rhodium in complex combination with the cyclic phosphite. Distilling off water from the aqueous extract phase may be facilitated by the presence of a compound forming an azeotropic mixture with water, for example, of cyclohexane. As such a distillation can be carried out at a relatively low temperature, no metallic rhodium is formed. The solvent for the rhodium complex may remain in the residual fraction or may be distilled off, depending on the boiling point thereof. If desired, the rhodium in complex combination with the cyclic phosphite present in the residual fraction may be reused for hydroformylation. Alternatively, it may be converted into a hydroformylation catalyst comprising rhodium in complex combination with a phosphine or with a phosphite other than the said cyclic phosphite this may be carried out by, for example, burning the rhodium cyclic phosphite complex with formation of rhodium dioxide, which, in turn, is converted in a known manner into a hydro formylation catalyst. According to another preferred embodiment of the present invention one or more metals of Group 5b or of Group 7b of the Periodic Table of the Elements are extracted from the organic medium, particular preference being given to metals of Group 5b in view of the highly efficient extraction. Very good results have been obtained with the extraction of vanadium. Among the metals of Group 7b manganese is preferred. Suitable solvents for the complex of rhodium with the cyclic phosphite are polar and more readily soluble in water than in the reaction mixture. The aqueous extract phase then, will contain the polar solvent as well. Examples of suitable solvents are carboxamides, for example, dimethylformamide, N,N dimethylacetamide and N methylpyrrolidone, sulphoxides, for example, dimethyl sulphoxide and diethyl sulphoxide, tetrahydrothiophene 1,1 dioxide also referred to as sulfolane and derivatives thereof for example 3 methylsulfolane . Other examples of suitable solvents are alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol and 2 propanol, esters, such as ethyl acetate, ketones, such as acetone and methyl isobutyl ketone and ethers, such as 1,4 dioxane, tetrahydrofuran and anisole. The invention is further illustrated by means of the following Examples. The phosphite used in the Examples was 4 hydroxymethyl 2,6,7 trioxa 1 phosphabicyclo 2,2,2 octane, indicated in the Examples as POP . A 300 ml stainless steel autoclave equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a gas inlet tube, a thermocouple pipe and a pressure indicator was charged with 1 decene 0.4 mol , ethanol 50 ml , 1,5 c yclooctadiene rhodium I acetate 0.08 mmol and POP 1.055 mmol , the molar ratio POP to rhodium being 13.2. The 1 decene had been purified by means of an elution over basic aluminium oxide. The autoclave was flushed with an equimolar mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide and then pressurized to 10 bar with this mixture. The reaction mixture was heated up to 90 C whilst maintaining the pressure at 10 bar. After a total reaction time of 23 h the mixture was allowed to cool to ambient temperature. The autoclave was depressurized and the reaction mixture was pumped under air into a separatory funnel for extraction with water once, 25 ml, the volume ratio of the aqueous phase to the reaction mixture being 1 5 . After phase separation no rhodium could be detected in the organic phase, the content thereof being less than 1 part per million by weight. The organic phase contained the aldehydes formed, unreacted 1 decene and non alpha decenes. All of the non alpha decenes had been formed in the autoclave, no formation thereof being observed during the extraction with water. From the aqueous layer the solvents ethanol and water were removed by means of a simple flash over a rotavapour, leaving behind a solid complex containing rhodium and POP. This solid complex was dissolved in fresh ethanol and re used as catalyst in Example 2 in the same manner as in Example 1. The results are stated in Table I. The percentage of the starting 1 decene that has been converted into non alpha decenes is presented under the heading non alpha decenes and the linearity is defined as the percentage of n undecanal in the mixture of aldehydes formed. The autoclave as used in Example 1 was charged with 1 decene 0.4 mol , dimethylacetamide 50 ml , 1,5 cyclooctadiene rhodium I acetylacetonate 0.08 mmol and POP 1.03 mmol , the molar ratio POP to rhodium being 12.9. Then, the procedure of Example 1 was followed. After a total reaction time of 5 h the mixture was allowed to cool to ambient temperature. The autoclave was depressurized and the reaction mixture was pumped under air into a separatory funnel for extraction with water once, 10 ml, the volume ratio of the aqueous phase to the reaction mixture being 1 12½ . After phase separation no rhodium could be detected in the organic phase, the content thereof being less than 1 part per million by weight. The organic phase contained the aldehydes formed, unreacted 1 decene and non alpha decenes. All of the non alpha decenes had been formed in the autoclave, no formation thereof being observed during the extraction with water. From the aqueous layer water was removed azeotropically with cyclohexane at a pressure of 21 kPa and a maximum temperature of 80 C, leaving behind a solution of a complex containing rhodium and POP in dimethylacetamide. The results are presented in Table I. The solution of the complex obtained in Example 3 was re used as catalyst in the same manner as in Example 3. The results are stated in Table I. The solution of the complex obtained in Example 4 was re used as catalyst in the same manner as in Example 4. The results are stated in Table I. The solution of the complex obtained in Example 5 was re used as catalyst in the same manner as in Example 5. The results are stated in Table I. Example 3 was repeated using 0.016 instead of 0.08 mmol of 1,5 cyclooctadiene rhodium I acetylacetonate and 0.2 mmol POP instead of 1.03 mmol. The results are presented in Table I. Comparison of the results obtained in Example 3 with those of Examples 4, 5 and 6 shows that the complex catalyst did not lose activity after recycle, whilst maintaining a high linearity. These facts indicate that very little rhodium was lost. RhH CO P C₆H₅ ₃ ₃ 0.013 mmol and triph enylphosphine 27.2 mmol , the molar ratio of triphenylphosphine to the rhodium compound being 2000, were dissolved in dimethylacetamide 20 ml . Then, a mixture of 1 decene 30 ml and toluene 20 ml was added. To the mixture thus obtained a solution of POP 0.26 mmol, molar ratio POP to Rh being 20 in dimethylacetamide 10 ml was added and the mixture was stirred for 15 min, the concentration of rhodium in the organic phase being 0.16 mmol l. Subsequently, water 50 ml was added, the volume ratio aqueous phase to organic phase being 0.6, followed by shaking and allowing to stand in a separating funnel. The lower aqueous layer was separated off and distilled to dryness giving a white solid. The organic layer 46 g was analyzed for rhodium by atomic absorption spectroscopy. No rhodium could be observed in the organic layer, which means that the rhodium content thereof was less than 1 part per million by weight ppm , while a concentration of 28 ppm would be expected if no extraction had taken place. This indicates a rhodium extraction efficiency in a single water wash of more than 95 . An amount of palladium acetylacetonate 0.32 mmol and of triphenylphosphine 3.24 mmol, the molar ratio of phosphine to palladium compound being 10 were dissolved in toluene 60 g , thus forming a red palladium complex. To the solution POP 1.8 mmol dissolved in ethanol 40 g was added, the molar ratio POP to Pd being 5.6, and the mixture was stirred for 30 min, the concentration of palladium in the organic phase being about 2.5 mmol l. Then, water 20 ml was added, the volume ratio aqueous phase to organic phase being about 0.2, followed by stirring for 10 min. After phase separation the aqueous layer contained 97 of the starting amount of palladium and the organic layer 3 . A second water wash 20 ml was sufficient for quantitative removal of palladium from the organic phase. 1 Decene was hydroformylated in the presence of RhH CO P C₆H₅ ₃ ₃ followed by distillation of the reaction mixture, yielding a residue of heavy ends containing a complex 0.037 mmol of rhodium with triphenylphosphine and 37 mmol of free triphenylphosphine, the molar ratio of triphenylphosphine to rhodium complex being 1000. To this residue a solution of POP 1.2 mmol, molar ratio POP to Rh being 32 in dimethylacetamide 50 ml was added and the mixture was stirred for 2 hours. Then, water 20ml was added and after stirring and phase separation the aqueous and organic layer were analysed, indicating that 95 of the starting amount of rhodium was present in the aqueous phase. Tetracarbonylcyclopentadienyl vanadium 0.1 g, 0.44 mmol was dissolved in toluene 45 g . To this solution red POP 0.7 g, 4.27 mmol dissolved in ethanol 50 ml was added. The colour of the mixture thus formed changed into yellow green indicating the formation of a vanadium POP complex. After 1 h stirring at ambient temperature water 50 ml was added and stirring was continued for 5 min. After settling and phase separation the layers were analysed. More than 99 of the vanadium was removed from the organic phase into the aqueous phase. Example 11 was repeated with the exception that POP 0.7 g was not present. All of the vanadium stayed in the organic layer. A mixture of linear non α olefins having from 10 to 14 carbon atoms per molecule was hydroformylated in the presence of a cobalt containing catalyst, followed by distillation of the reaction mixture, yielding a residue of heavy ends 23.5 g . To this residue was added ethylhexanol 69 g and toluene 40 g and finally so much POP that a POP cobalt molar ratio of 15 was obtained. A buff coloured precipitate was formed. Then, water 450 ml was added to dissolve the precipitate. After settling and phase separation the layers were analysed. This single water wash had extracted more than 97 of the cobalt into the aqueous layer. Manganese carbonyl of the formula Mn₂ CO ₁₀ 0.377 g and triphenylphosphine 1.0 g were dissolved in toluene 60 ml . The solution formed was treated and kept under reflux for one hour the colour of the solution changed being an indication of the formation of a manganese triphenylphosphine complex. The solution was allowed to adapt ambient temperature and then a solution of POP 0.5 g in ethanol 30 ml was added. The mixture was stirred for one hour, water was added and after further stirring for 5 min, settling and phase separation the aqueous layer was analysed. About 20 of the starting amount of manganese was dissolved in the aqueous layer.
