## Abstract
A reaction mass and hydraulic cylinder assembly for a seismic transducer. A hydraulic biasing cylinder 76 is formed between a lower piston rod 32 and a reaction mass 44 and is located below a hydraulic drive cylinder 46 . The lower piston rod 32 includes a first portion 36 and a detach able second portion 38 40 , the detachable second portion forming an upward facing shoulder 42 which partially defines the hydraulic biasing cylinder 76 . The hydraulic drive cylinder 46 is formed by a cylinder sleeve 48 and upper and lower cylinder bushings 50 and 52 having lower and upper ends 54 and 56 , respectively, concentrically received within the cylinder sleeve 48 to define the upper and lower ends, respectively, of the hydraulic drive cylinder.
