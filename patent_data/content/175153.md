## Description
This invention relates to a method of processing a light sensitive silver halide color photographic material. More particularly, it relates to a method of processing a light sensitive silver halide color photographic material which may not cause edge stain of color photographic paper and may improve stability of an image after the processing. In general, light sentive silver halide photographic materials are, after exposure to light, processed by the steps of developing bleaching fixing water washing. Such processing, however, has recently put a problem of environmental preservation or a problem of water resources which has been considered important. For this reason, a method which may reduce the amount of washing water having been used in a large amount has been proposed. For instance, as a technique to make small the amount of washing water by allowing the water to flow backward to washing tanks of multi stepwise construction, methods disclosed in West German Patent No. 29 20 222 and a technical literature of S.R. Goldwasser, Water flow rate in immersion washing of motionpicture film Jour. SMPTE, 64, 248 253, May 1955 are known. Further, a method of carrying out stabilizing processing without substantially any water washing by omitting the washing step is disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publications No. 8543 1982, No. 14834 1983 and 134636 1983. On the other hand, polyethylene coated papers have been used principally as conventional color photographic papers. The polyethylene coated papers, however, were found to become readily stained during storage because benzyl alcohol or a color developing agent contained in a color developing solution permeates to the papers, to which metal ion in an oxidizing agent or a fixing solution is adsorbed. In particular, when a non washing processing is carried out, it was found that, although non colored directly after the processing, the photographic papers are extremely colored with time lapse during storage because of processing chemicals having not been removed, thereby causing the problem of edge stain. Also, it was found that, when a photographic material having been processed is stored, generation of yellow stains or discoloration of cyan dyes is disadvantageously enormous. Moreover, since the non washing processing using the conventional polyethylene coated photographic paper requires to contain ferric ions in a stabilizing solution, yellow stains are liable to be formed by storing specimens after the processing. Meanwhile, a processing solution may be a bleach fixing solution which have both the bleaching ability and fixing ability. In a processing solution having the bleaching ability used in the processing of a light sensitive silver halide color photographic material, inorganic oxidizing agents such as red prussiate and dichromate are widely used as an oxidizing agent to bleach silver images. However, some serious drawbacks have been pointed out in respect of the processing solution having the bleaching ability and containing these inorganic oxidizing agents. For instance, red prussiate and dichromate are relatively excellent in the bleaching power of silver images, but are liable to be decomposed by light to form cyanate ions or hexavalent chromate ions which are harmful to human bodies, and therefore have a nature undesirable for the prevention of pollution. Also, because of very strong oxidizing powder of these oxidizing agents, it is difficult to make a silver halide solubilizing agent such as thiosulfate a fixing agent coexist in a same processing solution, and it is almost impossible to use these oxidizing agent in a bleach fixing bath, thereby making it difficult to achieve the objects of making the processing speedier and simpler. Moreover, the processing solution containing these inorganic oxidizing agents has a drawback that it is difficult to recycle it without dumping the wastewater after processing. To overcome the above disadvantages, a processing solution employing, as the oxidizing agent, complex metal salts of organic acids such as aminopolycarboxylic acid metal complex salts have recently been used as those which may cause less problems of pollution and meet demands for the speedy processing, the simple processing and the recycling of the watstewater. However, the processing solution using the metal complex salts of organic acids is slow in the oxidizing action and therefore disadvantageous in that the bleaching rate oxidizing rate of silver images metal silver formed at a developing step is low. For instance, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid iron III complex salt which is considered strongest in the bleaching power among aminocalboxylic acid metal complex salts has been put into practical use in a certain art, but it is insufficient in the bleaching power when used for high sensitivity light sensitive silver halide color photographic materials principally comprising silver bromide or silver iodobromide emulsion, in particular, color photographic papers containing silver iodide as silver halide, color photograpic negative films and color reversal films, with the result that trace amounts of silver images remain even after processing for a long period of time to make the desilvering property inferior. This tendency is remarkable especially when the bleach fixing solution is used because the oxidation reduction potential is lowered in the case of the bleach fixing solution in which the oxidizing agent is present together with thiosulfate and sulfite. An object of this invention is to provide a method of processing a light sensitive silver halide color photographic material, which can keep dyes stably and may not produce yellow stains or stains on edge, i.e., stains on a cut surface of a photographic paper, with time lapse during storage even when a non washing processing is carried out. Another object of this invention is to provide a method of processing a light sensitive silver halide color photographic material, which causes less stains at cut surfaces of a photographic paper even when processing is carried out by use of a processing solution employing ferric salt of organic acid, whereby, in particular, the edge stain under time lapse after the processing can be improved to a greater extent. As a result of intensive studies, the present inventors have found that the above object can be achieved by a processing method as summarized below. Namely, this invention is to provide a method of processing a light sensitive silver halide color photographic material which comprises subjecting to imagewise exposure a light sensitive silver halide color photographic material having a light sensitive silver halide emulsion layer on i a substrate coated with a resin cured by irradiation with electron rays or ii one side or both sides of a substrate of an opaque thermoplastic resin film comprising a synthetic polyester film coated on its one side or both sides with fine particles of white pigment and or a synthetic polyester film containing said fine particles dispersed in the film and applied with molecular orientation, followed by color developing processing and, after processing by use of a processing solution having fixing ability, stabilizing processing without substantially any water washing step. The problems mentioned in the foregoing are a problem of stain generating between a portion coated with polyethylene and an emulsion surface and a problem of detorioration of image or increase in stain density on white border of prints. Based on such findings, the present inventors have found that the object of this invention can be achieved, as a first aspect of the invention, by subjecting a color printing material having at least one layer of silver halide photographic material on a substrate coated with a resin cured by irradiation with light, to a stabilizing processing without any water washing step. Alternatively, as a second aspect of the invention, the present inventors have found that the object of the invention can be achieved also by subjecting to a stabilizing processing without any water washing step, a light sensitive silver halide color photographic material having a light sensitive silver halide emulsion layer on one side or both sides of a substrate of an opaque thermoplastic resin film comprising a synthetic polyester film coated on its one side or both sides with fine particles of white pigment and or a synthetic polyester film containing said fine particles dispersed in the film and applied with molecular orientation. As an embodiment of the invention, the above processing solution having fixing solution may be a bleach fixing solution, in which bleaching and fixing are carried out in a single step. The present inventors have made further studies to have come to a finding of an organic acid ferric complex salt comprising free acid having the molecular weight of 300 or more, which is, among the organic acid metal complex salts, useful as an oxidizing agent having excellent oxidizing power at a higher pH range. A bleaching solution or a bleach fixing solution employing such an organic acid ferric complex salt shows a rapid silver bleaching action when it has pH of 3.0 or more, particualrly, 7 or more. This invention will be described below in detail. As a method in which a coated layer curable by irradiation with electron rays is applied by coating on a paper and then allowing to cure by irradiation with electron rays, which may be used in this invention, there may be metnioed the methods as disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publications Nos. 27257 1982, 30830 1982, 49946 1982 and 124336 1984, and Japanese Patent Applications Nos. 32237 1984 and 105969 1984. When prepared by the method mentioned above, it is necessay to apply any adhesion means in order to firmly adhere a photographic image forming layer which is a hydrophilic colloidal layer comprising a continuous layer of hydrophilic colloids, such as a gelatin silver halide emulsion layer principally comprised of gelatin hereinafter refered to merely as photographic layer , to the substrate having a coated layer. As a general method of giving the adhesion force between such a photographic layer and the substrate having a coated layer, there may be mentioned a method in which a surface activation processing method known in the art and represented by, for example, corona discharge processing, glow discharge processing or ultraviolet ray irradiation processing is applied on the surface of the substrate, and, after applying this surface activation processing, the photographic layer is directly coated, or a layer or layers comprising a subbing solution having affinity to the above photographic layer is provided on the surface of the substrate to form subbing layer s and thereafter the photographic layer is applied on it by coating. It is also possible to employ a method in which a known compound having ethylenic unsaturated double bonds in the molecule is applied by coating on a base material of a substrate, a cured layer is formed by irradiation with electron rays, and then the photographic layer is coated on the cured layer. In such a case, as a means for adhering the photographic layer to the substrate comprising the cured layer, it is difficult to expect sufficient adhesion force from only the above mentioned surface activation method by the corona dishcarge processing or the like, but it can be improved by forming a coated layer of a cured resin obtained by epoxy ring opening ploymerization. In this invention, the resin cured by irradiation with electron rays includes both a resin cured by initiating a polymerization reaction in the presence of a polymerization initiator while being irradiated with electron rays and a resin cured by initiating the polymerization reaction without the polymerization initiator. When a polymerization initiator is used, a compound having at least two epoxy groups in one molecule, for example, may be mentioned as a compound capable of initiating the polymerization reaction by the irradiation with electron rays. Namely, the compound having at least two epoxy groups in one molecule hereinafter referred to as a epoxy compound of the invention is a compound in which, when used singularly, the ring opening polymerization does not occur even by the irradiation with electron rays. The polymeriaation reaction occurs when a substance capable of initiating cation polymerization is co existent therewith. The epoxy compound may include epoxy resins as mentioned below. However, the epoxy compound of the invention is not limited to these. The epoxy compounds as exemplified in the foregoing can be available as commercial products mentioned below The epoxy compound is a compound having the molecular weight ranging preferably from 10,000 or less, more preferably from 100 to 3,000. There is no particular limitation for the polymerization initiator, but preferably an onium salt which discharges Lewis acid capable of initiating the polymerization by irradiation with electron rays may be used. Such an onium salt can be represented by General Formula I below. In the formula, R¹, R², R³ and R⁴ may be the same and different and each represent an organic group a, b, c and d each represent an integer of 0 to 3 and the sum of a b c d is equal to the valence of Z. Z reoresents a group of N N, Sr Se, Te, P, As, Sb, Bi, halogen atoms for example, iodine, chlorine, bromine and the like atoms and M is a metal or semi metal which is a central atom of a halide complex, and represents Sb, Fe, Sn, Bi, Al, Ga, In, Ti, Zn, Sc, V, Cr, Mn, Co and the like. X represents a halogen atom In General Formula I above, the complex ions represented by MX Of the compounds represented by the above Formula I , ziazonium compounds do not necessarily have good preservability and have a shorter pot life, to require the two part liquid combination system. Also, they are liable to produce bubbles or pin holes in a coated layer because of nitrogen gas generated by the decomposition, and sometimes cause coloration of the cured layer. Therefore, in this invention, it is preferred to use the compounds other than the ziazonium compounds for the reasons that they are excellent in the preservability, suitable for the one part liquid system and free from the fear of generating nitrogen gas. The the onium series polymerization initiators represented by Formula I mentioned above are known itself in the art. For instance, the compound in which Z is the group of N N, namely a ziazonium compound, is disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,708,296 3,794,576 and 3,949,143. The other onium series polymerization initiators are disclosed in Belgium Patent Nos. 828,841 and 828,669, French Patent No. 2,270,269, etc. The above ziazonium compounds can be prepared by the method disclosed in the above U.S. Patent Nos. 3,708,296 and 3,949,143 or the method disclosed in A.L. Mayoock et al, Organic Chemistry , Vol. 35, No. 8, p 2532 1970 , I. Goerdeler, Methoden der Organischen Chemie , 11 12, pp 591 640 1958 , K. Sasse, ditto, 12 1, pp 79 112 1963 , M. Drexler et al, J.A.C.S., Vol. 75, p 2705 1953 , etc. The amount of using the polymerization initiator may be determined in correspondence with the curing rate and the curing method to be applied. It is preferred to use it in the range of from 0.05 to 10 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the resin component in a layer of a composition according to this invention as defined hereinafter . When the polymerization initiator is not used, the resin copolymerizable by irradiation with electron rays may include, for example, a compound having double bond s in the molecule preferably a compound having a plurality of double bonds in the molecule more preferaly a compound containing acryloyl group, methacryloyl group, acrylamide group, allyl group, vinyl ether group, vinyl thioether group, etc., and unsaturated polyesters and most preferably unsaturated polyesters, unsaturated acrylates and unsaturated polycarbonates disclosed in A. Vrancken Fatipec Congress 1119 1972 , having molecular weight of about 1,000 to 20,000. The light sensitive material used in the first aspect of this invention may contain an inorganic white pigment. As the white pigment, those which are usually used in the field of photographic papers may be used, and, for example, titanium oxide of anatase type and rutile type , barium sulfate, calcium carbonate, aluminum oxide, magnesium oxide, etc. can be used, and in particular titanium oxide, barium sulfate and calcium carbonate are preferred. Also, the titanium oxide may be coated partially on its surface with hydrous metalic oxide compounds, for example, metal oxides of hydrous aluminum oxide, hydrous ferrite oxide, etc. However, any of inorganic white pigments may be used without any particular limitation. It is preferred to use the inorganic white pigment in an amount ranging from 20 to 200 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the above compound curable by irradiation with electron rays. It is also preferred for the pigment to have an average particle size of from 0.1 to 10 µm. The layer of a composition comprising the resin copolymerizable by irradiation with electron rays, the polymerization initiator optionally used and the inorganic white pigment also optionally used according to this invention hereinafter referred to as a composition according to this invention may be applied by coating on the substrate as a layer constituted singularly or as layers constituted in plurality. The paper substrate to be used in this invention may include, for example, natural pulpe, synthetic pulpe and a paper comprising a mixture of these. To these papers, known paper strengthening agent, sizing agent, inorganic pigment, colorant, fluorescent whitening agent and the like may be added optionally. Besides the above mentioned substrate a synthetic paper such as polypropyrene and polyester, a film base such as polyethylenetelephthalate may be used. Moreover, even a substrate obtained by applying lamination on the surafce of a paper to form a composite material may be used. A coated layer formed by allowing the layer of the composition on the substrate to cure by irradiation with electron rays herein after referred to as the coated lyer according to the invention may be finished in mirror face by applying a smoothening treatment, or may be applied optionally with embossing. To perform the mirror face finishing, a treated surface may be brought into contact with a mirror face roll and cured by irradiating electron rays from the back side of the substrate to give a mirror face finished surface. Alternatively, preliminary irradiation may be carried out to cure the surface in part, and thereafter the treated surface may be brought into contact with a mirror face roll and then peeled, followed by secondary irradiation to have it cured completely. The mirror face roll includes a chrome plated roll, a stainless steel roll, etc. When the embossing is applied, as an embossing roll to be used in place of the mirror face roll, there may be used a roll obtained by embossing silky patterns, fine particlulate patterns, etc. on the roll such as stainless steel roll and chrome plated roll by surface sanding, spattering, etching, plating or the like method. In order to apply the mirror face finishing or the embossing treatment, it may be applied after coating of a solution of the composition and after removal of a part or all of organic solvents, or alternatively, the removal of the organic solvents may be performed after having applied the embossing. As an electron beam accelarator used for the irradiation with electron rays, there may be employed any of an electrocurtain system, a Van de Graf type scanning system and a double scanning system. As for electron ray characteristics, it is preferred from a viewpoint of transmission power to use an electron beam accelarator of 100 to 750 kV, preferably, 150 to 300 kV, and to control the dosae of absorption to 0.5 to 20 Mrad. When the irradiation with electron rays is carried out, it may be done in the atmosphere of an inert gas such as N₂ The coated layer used in the invention as such exhibits good adhesiveness to the photographic layer, but it can exhibit more excellent adhesiveness by applying a surface activation treatment such as a treatment by corona discharging or glow discharging. An adhesion effect same as the above mentioned can also be obtained by simple subbing processing with use of gelatin or the like. At least one coated layer of the coated layers is provided on the substrate at the side having a layer on which photographic images are formed for example, a silver halide emulsion layer, an image receiving layer in the dye diffusion process, etc. . Further, the coated layer s is preferably provided on both sides of the substrate from the viewpoint of waterproofness. When there is at one side thereof no layer on which photographic images are formed, this kind of coated layer at this side can be a coated layer having the constitution such that the inorganic white pigment is removed from the coated layer, The substrate is preferably provided with at least one layer of barrier s between a base paper and the resin cured by irradiation with electron beams. Such substrates are disclosed in detail in Japanese Patent Publication No. 124336 1984. The white pigment used in the light sensitive silver halide color photgraphic material used in the second aspect of this invention is not particularly limited, but preferably includes inorganic white pigments such as barium sulfate, titanium oxide, barium carbonate, talc, magnesium oxide and kaolin. Of these, two compounds, barium sulfate and titanium oxide are preferred. These may be used singularly or in combination of two or more kinds. Content of the white pigment is preferably in the range of from 5 to 50 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the synthetic polyester. Particle size of the white pigment is preferably in the range of from 0.5 to 50 µm. When the white pigment has the particle size exceeding this range, it is preferred to control the particle size distribution so as to be not more than 0.1 . The synthetic polyester film used in this invention may be an opaque layer formed by coating its one side or both sides with the above white pigment, or alternatively it may be an opaque layer formed by having the above white pigment conatained by dispersion in the layer and applied with molecular orientation. Further, it may be an opaque layer comprising two layers formed by the coated layer and the molecular oriented layer. The substrate of the thermoplastic resin film used in this invention constitutes, or has, the opaque layer comprising the synthetic polyester film mentioned above. Method of coating the white pigment is not particularly limited, but there may be employed the methods such as air docter coating, blade coating, squeeze coating, air knife coating, reverse roll coating and caster coating. The above mentioned opaque layer is formed by the presence of white pigment based on these coating methods. Alternatively, the opaque layer is formed based on the presence of voids formed by having the white pigment contained by dispersion in the polyester and applied with molecular orientation. As a means for having it contained by dispersion, it is possible to have it contained by dispersion, for instnace, by forming a slurry in glycol as practiced in the production of polyesters. Means for applying the molecular orientation is not particularly limited, and conventional known methods may be employed. As known methods, it has been practiced to supply polyester to the surface of a cooling mold by melt extrusion through means of a slot die and quench the polyester on the surface thereof to make it amorphous, or draw it in one direction or mutually vertical two directions at a high temperature to effect the molecular orientation, followed by heat setting see British Patent No. 838,708 . Drawing ratio, drawing temperature and heat setting temperature are not particularly limited. For instance, when the drawing ratio is greater, the larger voids are formed and the higher opacity is obtained. Also, when the drawing temperature and the heat setting temperature is lower, larger voids are obtained in general. In the case of a substrate of biaxially oriented film of polyethyleneterephthalate, it is preferred to prepare it at the drawing temperature of about 90 C, selecting the drawing ratio in the range of from 3.0 1 to 4.2 1 and using the heat setting temperature of about 210 C. The opacity of film is determined by the thickness of a film, and can be represented by whole light transmittance to be measured by ASTM Test Method D 1003 61. The whole light transmittance of the film substrate used in this invention and having the film thickness of 150 µm, when measured by this test method, is 20 or less, particularly preferably 10 or less. Other additives than the above white pigment may be contained in the polyester film. Such other additives may include pigments other than the above mentioned, brightening agents and dyes. The polyester used in this invention can be obtained by combining, for instance, one or more of dicarboxylic acids or their lower alkyl diesters and one or more of glycols together with monocarboxylic acids such as pivarlic acid. The above dicarboxylic acids include terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid, phthalic acid, 2,5 , 2,6 , and 2,7 naphthalene dicarboxylic acids, succinic acid, sebacic acid, adipic acid, azelaic acid, diphenylcarboxylic acid and hexahydroterephthalic acid or bis p carboxylphenoxyethane. The above mentioned glycols include ethylene glycol, 1,3 propanediol, 1,4 butanediol, neopentyl glycol and 1,4 cyclohexanedimethanol. A heat set film of polyethyleneterephthalate applied with the biaxial orientation and the heat setting is particularly preferred in this invention. The light sensitive silver halide color photographic material used in this invention is obtained by applying a light sensitive silver halide emulsion layer by coating on one side or both sides of the above substrate of thermoplastic resin film. Each of the silver halide emulsion layers may contain a coupler, namely, a compound capable of forming a dye by the reaction with an oxidant of a color developing agent. As the above coupler, there may be used yellow couplers, magenta couplers and cyan couplers having been conventionally known. These couplers may be either of the so called two equivalent type or four equivalent type. Also, it is possible to use a diffusible dye emission type coupler in combination with these couplers. The yellow coupler may include ring opened ketomethylene compounds conventionally used, and in addition those couplers which are called two equivalent couplers including active site o aryl substituted couplers, active site o acyl substituted couplers, active site hydantoin compound substituted couplers, active site urazole compound substituted couplers, active site succinimid compound substituted couplers, active site fluorine substituted couplers, active site chlorine or bromine substituted couplers, and active site o sulfonyl substituted couplers, which are effectively used in this invention.

The magenta coupler used in this invention may include compounds of pyrazolone type, pyrazolotriazole type, pyrazolinobenzimidazole type and indazolone type. These magenta couplers may be not only the four equivalent type couplers but also the two equivalent type couplers, similarly to the case of the yellow couplers. Specific examples of these magenta couplers are disclosed in U.S Patent Nos. 2,600,788, No. 2,983,608, No. 3,062,653, No. 3,127,269, No. 3,311,476, No. 3,419,391, No. 3,519,429, No. 3,558,319, No. 3,582,322, No. 3,615,506, No. 3,834,908 and No. 3,891,445 West German Patent No. 18 10 464 West German Unexamined Patent Publications OLS No. 24 08 665, No. 24 17 945, No. 24 18 959 and 24 24 467 Japanese Patent Publication KOKOKU No. 6031 1965 Japanese Unexamined Patent Publications KOKAI No. 20826 1976, No. 58922 1977, No.129538 1974, No. 74027 1974, No. 159336 1975, No. 42121 1977, No. 74028 1974, No. 60233 1975, No. 26541 1976 and No. 55122 1978 and No. 35858 1982. Useful cyan couplers which may be further used in this invention may include, for example, couplers of phenol type and naphthol type. These couplers may be not only the four equivalent type couplers but also the two equivalent type couplers, as in the case of the yellow couplers.

In order to have these couplers contained in the silver halide emulsion used in this invention, they may be added as an alkaline solution when the couplers are alkali soluble, or alternatively, when they are oil soluble, it is preferred that the couplers may be added to the silver halide emulsion by dissolving them in a solvent of high boiling point, optionally in combination with a solvent of low boiling point, in accordance with the methods disclosed, for instance, in each of the specifications of U.S. Patents No. 2,322,027, No. 2,801,170, No. 2,801,171, No. 2,272,191 and No. 2,304,940 until they are dispersed therein in the form of fine particles. In this instance, other hydroquinone derivatives, ultraviolet absorbents, anti discoloration agents, etc. may be used in combination, if necessary. Also, two or more kinds of couplers may be used by mixing them, without any inconvenience. Referring more specifically to a method of adding the couplers which is preferred in this invention, one or two or more kinds of the couplers is are added to the silver halide emulsion by dissolving it them in a high boiling solvent such as organic amides, carbamates, esters, ketones, urea derivatives, ethers, hydrocarbons, in particular, di n butylphthalate, tr cresylphosphate, triphenylphosphate, di isooctylazelate, di n butylsebacate, tri n hexylphosphate, N,N di ethyl caprylamidebutyl N,N diethyllaurylamide, n pentadecylphenyl ether, di octylphthalate, n nonylphenol, 3 pentadecylphenylethyl ether, 2,5 di sec amylphenylbutyl ether, monophenyl di o chlorophenylphosphate and fluoroparaffin, and or a low boiling solvent such as methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, propyl acetate, butyl acetate, butyl propionate, cyclohexanol, diethylene glycol monoacetate, nitromethane, carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, cyclohexanetetrahydrofuran, methyl alcohol, acetonitrile, dimethylformamide, dioxane and methyl ethyl ketone, together with, if necessary, other couplers, hydroquinone derivatives, anti discoloration agents, ultraviolet absorbents, etc., and mixing with an aqueous solution containing an anionic surfactant such as alkylbenzenesulfonic acid and alkylnaphthalenesulfonic acid and or a nonionic surfactant such as sorbitansesquioleic acid ester and sorbitanmonolauric acid ester and or a hydrophilic binder such as gelatin, followed by dispersion by emulsification with use of a high speed rotating mixer, a colloid mill, a ultrasonic wave dispersing device, etc. Alternatively, the above coupler s may be dispersed by use of a latex dispersion method. The latex dispersion method and the effects obtainable therefrom are dislcosed in each of the official bulletins of Japanese Unexamined Patent Publications KOKAI No. 74538 1974, No. 59943 1976 and No. 32552 1979 or in Research Disclosure No. 148, pp 50, 77 79 August, 1976 . The latex suitable for use in this invention includes, for example, homopolymers, copolymers and terpolymers of monomers such as styrene, acrylate, n butyl acrylate, n butyl methacrylate, 2 acetoacetoxyethyl methacrylate, 2 methacryloyloxy ethyl trimethylammoniummethosulfate, sodium 3 methacryloyloxy propane 1 sulfonate, N isopropyl acrylamide, N 2 2 methyl 4 oxopentyl acrylamide and 2 acrylamide 2 methylpropanesulfonate. The light sensitive silver halide color photographic material used in this invention may further contain various kinds of additives for photography. For example, there may be used antifoggants, stabilizers ultraviolet absorbents, color contamination preventive agents, brightening agents, color image discoloration preventive agents, antistatic agents, hardeners, surfactants, plastisizers, wetting agents, etc. as dosclosed in Research Disclosure No. 17643. The hydrophilic colloid used in the light sensitive silver halide color photographic material in order to prepare an emulsion, includes any of proteins such as gelatin, derived gelatin, a graft polymer of gelatin and other polymer, albumin and casein cellulose derivatives such as a hydroxyethylcellulose derivative and carboxymethylcellulose starch derivatives synthetic hydrophilic polymers which are monomers or copolymers of polylvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl imidazole, polyacrylamide, etc. The silver halide emulsion usable in this invention may be any of those employing silver halides such as silver chloride, silver bromide, silver iodide, silver chlorobromide, silver chloroiodide, silver iodobromide, silver chloroiodobromide and mixture of these. In order to have the effect of the invention shown most effectively, silver iodide is particularly preferred to be contained in an amount of 0.1 mol or more. Particularly desirable effect is shown when the total amount of the silver including silver halides is 20 mg dm² or more. The foregoing light sensitive silver halide color photographic material is, after exposure to light, subjected to color developing processing, and, after processing by use of the processing solution having fixing ability according to this invention, further subjected to stabilizing processing. Here, a typical example of the processing solution having fixing ability includes a fixing solution and a bleach fixing solution. When the fixing solution is used, a processing by bleaching solution is carried out between the color developing processing and the processing by fixing solution. In this invention, the stabilizing processing is meant to be a processing for a stabilizing processing without substantially any water washing step, in which the stabilizing processing is carried out immediately after processing by the processing solution having fixing ability. The processing solution used for this stabilizing processing is called a stabilizing solution, and a tank for such processing is called a stabilizing bath or a stabilizing tank. In this invention, the stabilizing processing requires one or more tanks, preferably 1 to 3 tanks, and at most 9 or less tanks. Namely, when the amount of replenishing solutions is constant, the more the number of the tanks is, the lower the concentration of stain components in a final stabilizing bath becomes. However, the total amount of solutions in tanks increases with the number of tanks to lower the rate of the renewal of solutions in tanks by the repleshishing solution and elongate the residence time of the stabilizing solution. Such elongation of the residence time of the solutions in tanks impairs the preservability of the solutions and promotes the generation of precipitations undesirably. Hereinafter, all of processing solutions to be used in the processing steps subsequent to the processing by the processing solution having fixing ability are called stabilizing solutions, and also a step subsequent to the processing step by the processing solution having fixing ability is called a stabilizing processing step. In this invention, carrying out the stabilizing processing without substantially any water washing step is meant to be a case where the volume of bleaching solution, bleach fixing solution or fixing solution brought into a most anterior stabilizing tank is 1 2000 or more, preferably 1 500 or more, most preferably 1 250 or more, relative to that of stabilizing solution. If the concentration of bleaching solution, bleach fixing solution or fixing solution in the most anterior stabilizing tank is kept less than 1 2000, processings such as rinsing, auxiliary water washing and processing by washing accelerating bath may be carried out for a very short period of time according to a single tank or multiple tank countercurrent system. In particular, it is preferred that the concentration of bleaching solution, bleach fixing solution or fixing solution in the stablizing solution is 500 ppm or more. In this invention, the pH of the stabilizing solution is preferably in the range of 2.0 to 10, and in particular, it is preferred to adjust it to pH 3.0 to 9.0 from the viewpoint of stability in image preservation. In order to enhance the stability in image preservation, the stabilizing solution used in this invention may contain, for instance, chelating agents such as polyphosphate, aminopolycarboxylate, phosphonocarboxylate and aminophosphonate , salts of organic acids such as citric acid, acetic acid, succinic acid, oxalic acid and benzoic acid , pH adjusting agents such as sulfite, phosphate, borate, hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid , mildew proofing agents such as phenol derivatives, catechol derivatives, imidazole derivatives, triazole derivatives, thiabendazole derivatives, organic halogen compounds and other mildew proofing agents known as slime controlling agents in paper pulpe industries , brightening agents, sufactants, antiseptics, organic sulfur compounds, onium salts, formalin, ect.

When the stabilizing processing is carried out in a multiple tank system, it is preferably carried out in a shorter time in the tanks of anterior stages, and in a longer time in the tanks of posterior stages. In particular, it is desired that the processing is carried out subsequently in the processing time of 20 to 50 increase of that in an anterior tank. Further, the stabilizing processing steps may comprise multiple tanks, employing a countercurrent system where the repleshing solution is supplied from a posterior tank and allowed to overflow subsequently into an anterior tank, but most preferably should comprise a single tank. In this invention, the fixing processing is carried out in a processing bath containing a soluble complex forming agent a fixing agent capable of making a silver halide soluble as a silver halide complex salt, in which not only an ordinary fixing solution but also a bleach fixing solution, a combined developing and fixing solution and a combined developing and bleach fixing solution may be included.

Of these, potassium salt, sodium salt and ammoium salt are preferably used. These ferric complex salts may be used singularly, or may be used in combination of two or more kinds.

A coating liquid having the composition described below was mixed and dispersed with a ball mill and the resulting mixture was coated on one side of a good quality paper applied with surface size obtained from anionic starch and NaCl and having a basis weight of 100 g m², the inner part of which had been subjected to size treatment with an alkaline ketene dimer and polyamide epichlorohydrin resin, so as to give a thickness of 20 µm, and subsequently electron rays were irradiated thereon at 200 kV and 5 Mrad dosage in a nitrogen gas atmosphere by the use of an electron beam accelarator. On the side opposite to the cured coated layer, the above liquid was coated so as to give a thickness of 20 mµ, and then electron beam was irradiated thereon similarly as above to cure it. Subsequently, on the surface of the first coating layer, a silver chlorobromide gelatin emulsion containing a coupler and further a protecting layer were coated, followed by drying to prepare a light sensitive silver halide color material. The coated sample thus obtained was designated as Sample 1. Next, a coating having the composition described below was mixed and dispersed with a ball mill and the resulting mixture was coated on one side of a good quality paper having a basis weight of 100 g m², which had been subjected to size treatment similarly as above, so as to give a thickness of 20 µm, and subsequently electron beam was irradiated thereon at 200 kV and 5 Mrad dosage by the use of an electron beam accelarator. On the side opposite to the cured coated layer, the above liquid was coated so as to give a thickness of 20 mµ and electron beam was irradiated thereon similarly as above to cure it. Subsequently, on the surface of the first coating layer, a silver chlorobromide gelatin emulsion containing a coupler and further a protecting layer were coated, followed by drying to prepare a light sensitive silver halide color material. The coated sample thus obtained was designated as Sample 2. Further, a coating liquid described below was mixed and dispersed with a ball mill and the resulting mixture was coated on a good quality paper having a basis weight of 100 g m² On the side opposite to the cured coated layer, the above liquid was coated so as to give a thickness of 30 mµ and electron beam was irradiated thereon similarly as above to cure it.

The amounts replenished were 2.0 ml as for the color developing tank, 2.5 ml as for the bleach fixing tank and 2.8 ml as for the stabilizing tank per 100 cm² of the color paper, respectively. In the automatic processing device, the stabilizing tanks were arranged so that a first tank to a third tank were lined in the direction of flow of the light sensitive materials, to employ the multiple tank countercurrent system in which replenishment of the solutions was made in the last tank first, the solution over flown from the last tank was introduced to its previous tank, the solution overflown from this tank was further introduced to its further previous tank and finally overflown from the most previous tank was employed. The processing was continued until the total amount of the solutions replenished reached five times the total capacitites of the first to the third stabilizing tanks. The sample after the continuous processing was taken out in a length of 1 m, stored under 80 RH at 60 C for 2 weeks and then wound up onto a role to measure stain concentration in the edge parts of the sample.

The results obtained were substantially the same as in Example 1. 20 wt. parts of barium sulfate as a white pigment and 80 wt. parts of polyethyleneterephthalate were blended to obtain a composition for forming a film. The blend obtained was molded by extrusion through a film forming die and then cooled on a rotating rapid cooling drum which had been cooled, to make it amorphous. The film was then drawn at a draw ratio of the longitudinal direction to the transverse direction of 3.4 1. The drawing temperature was approximately 90 C and the heat setting temperature was approximately 206 C. The film support obtained was sufficiently opaque and white and thus was adequate to use as a support for photographic printing. This film was used as the sample of the present invention. A polyethylene mixture was coated on both sides of paper of good quality having basis weight of 80 g m², the inner parts of which had been subjected to size treatment in a conventional manner, at a coating amount of approximately 12 g m² according to the extruded coating.
