# Tunable segmented ring magnet and method of manufacture.

## Abstract
A segmented permanent ring magnet 10 which is tunable to provide a preselected transverse magnetic field within the magnet interior is disclosed. The permanent magnet is con structed of material which has essentially linear behaviour in the second quadrant of the B H curve. The invention includes a method of tuning a segmented permanent ring magnet and a method of manufacture for blocks 14, 16, 18, 20 of magnetic material which make up the magnet. The magnets of the pre sent invention are particularly adapted for use as bias magnets in NMR imaging systems.
