# COPOLYMERS OF LACTAMS AND AZETIDINE 2,4 DIONE BASED PREPOLYMERS

## Abstract
Novel polyamide block copolymers are provided which comprise a central block of a soft segment derived from the residue of a polymeric polyol or polyamine joined to terminal hard segment polyamide blocks. The linkages which join the blocks are of a novel type and are the opened form of certain bis azetidine 2,4 dione rings. The block copolymers can be prepared very rapidly via an ionically polymerizing lactams on to prepolymer sort segments containing terminal azetidine 2,4 dione rings. The speed with which the polymerizations can be carried out make the block copolymers particularly useful for the RIM preparation of molded parts.
