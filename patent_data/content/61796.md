# Electric device comprising at least one low pressure mercury vapour discharge tube.

## Abstract
Electric device comprising at least one low pressure mercury vapour discharge tube 45 , which device is in tended to be connected to an a.c. voltage source the frequency of which is 50 to 60 Hz. According to the invention, the discharge tube 45 is of a type which produces a comparatively large current distortion and has a proportionally low required reignition voltage. The electric device has only small electric losses. Furthermore, the discharge tube 45 remains operative even at small deviations of the nominal mains voltage.
