# Catalyst and conversion of synthesis gas therewith.

## Abstract
A catalyst and process for the conversion of synthesis gas to a liquid hydrocarbon product having a boiling range of less than 204 44 C 400 F at a 90 overhead utilizing a nov el catalyst prepared from a water insoluble organic iron com pound. The process involves contacting synthesis gas with a single particle catalyst containing iron, a crystalline acidic aluminosilicate zeolite having a silica to alumina ratio of at least 12, a pore size greater than about 5 Angstrom units, and a constraint index of about 1 to 12, and a matrix. The catalyst does not contain promoters.
