# Heat resistant resin compositions and their use for coating metal substrates.

## Abstract
A heat resistant resin composition is described compris ing a varnish of a heat resistant resin containing active hyd rogen atoms in the molecule and a bismaleimide compound or derivative thereof admixed with the varnish. Especially when a bismaleimide compound or derivative thereof is added to a varnish of a polyimide resin containing active hydrogen atoms in the molecule and the composition is applied to a metal substrate to form a coating, the coating has improved peel strength and, in itself, has also improved strength and elongation.
