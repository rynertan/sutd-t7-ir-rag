# Burner for producing glass fine particles.

## Abstract
A burner for producing glass fine particles has central, intermediate and outer passages 21, 22 and 24 with the end of the intermediate passage 22 disposed inwardly from the end of the outer passage 24 and the end of the central passage 21 disposed between the end of the intermediate passage 22 and the end of the outer passage 24 . With this arrangement, e.g. graded refractive index distributions can be formed in the base material.
