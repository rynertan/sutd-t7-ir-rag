# Tape cassette for short time recording.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a tape cassette for short time recording hav ing an interchangeability with a long playing standard tape cas sette. The short time cassette has the external size and func tions substantially the same as that of the standard tape cas sette. The casing of the short time tape cassette is provided with a large aperture the area of which is made larger than that of an aperture formed in the bottom of the standard tape cas sette, owing to the reduction in the diameters of the reel flanges. With this arrangement, it is possible to accommodate the mechanism including the tape path within the outside di mensions of the tape cassette, thus allowing miniaturization of the mechanism of the apparatus which handles the tape. At the same time, a perfect interchangeability between the short time tape cassette and the standard tape cassette is obtained, so that users can operate both types of the tape cassette on an identical player such as a VTR.
