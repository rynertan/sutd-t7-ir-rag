# A control system for use in conjunction with a machine tool.

## Abstract
Apparatus for controlling the movement of a machine tool element through space to and from an operating position. The apparatus comprises means for defining a matrix of node points within said space, including a starting node point at which the element is located at the beginning of a movement cycle, means for defining predetermined paths along which it is possible for the element to move from each of the node points, each path extending between two nodes, means for detecting the arrival of the element at any node point and means for selecting from said predetermined paths the path to be followed after detection of the arrival of the element at any node point.
