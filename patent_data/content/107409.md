# Scroll type compressor with lubricating system.

## Abstract
A lubricating system for a scroll type compressor is de scribed. The compressor unit includes a housing having a front end plate and a cup shaped casing. A rotation preventing mechanism for an orbiting scroll is disposed between the inner end surface of the front end plate and a circular end plate of the orbiting scroll. A fluid inlet port is formed on the cup shaped casing and placed for opposing the rotation preventing mechanism. The part of fixed ring of rotation preventing mechanism which is opposited to the fluid inlet port has a cut portion. An oil passage way is formed through the front end plate with one end opening at the cut portion of fixed ring. The other end of oil passage way opens to a shaft seal cavity formed on the front end plate. Therefore, a shaft seal assembly within the shaft seal cavity is lubricated and cooled by lubricating oil and suction gas flowing through the oil passageway. Further passageways convey lubri cant from the shaft seal cavity to the bearing elements of the compressor and finally to the suction chamber of the compressor.
