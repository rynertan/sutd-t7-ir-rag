# Circuit arrangement and method for reducing quantization distortion in a signal processing device.

## Abstract
In a device having an analog to digital converter, which converts an input analog signal into a digital signal at a given conversion frequency, an auxiliary signal generator 30 for generating an auxiliary signal having a frequency, which equals one half the conversion frequency, and an adder 26 for superimposing the auxiliary signal on the input analog signal, are employed. Thus the added or superposed signal is converted into a digital signal with small quantization distortion, effectively preventing S N from being deterio rated. If desired, a dither signal may be added to the input analog signal before the auxiliary signal is added to the analog signal, so that quantization distortion will be further reduced.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Prior to describing the embodiments of the present invention, several conventional arrangements will be described for a better understanidng of the object and features of the present invention. Fig. 1 is a block diagram of an example of a conventional signal processing device including an analogto digital converter, and in Fig. 1, a reference numeral 10 is an input terminal of an analog signal 12 and 22, low pass filters LPFs 14, a sample and hold circuit 16, an analog to digital A D converter 18, a transmission line or a recording medium 20, a digital to analog D A converter, and 24, an output terminal for an analog signal, so that the original analog signal applied to the input terminal 10 is fed via the low pass filter 12 to the sample and hold circuit 14 to be sampled, and then it will be converted into a digital signal which corresponds to the sampled values in the A D converter 16.The digital signal emitted from the A D converter 16 is fed via the transmission line or recording medium 18 to the D A converter 20 to be converted into an analog signal, and taken it will be emitted via the low pass filter 22 to the output terminal 24 as an analog signal. In Fig. 1, the sa3mple and hold circuit 14, the A D converter 16, theD, A converter 20 and the like are all supplied with a given timing control signal. In the above mentioned signal processing circuit of Fig. 1, since there is no means for reducing quantizing distortion which necessarily occurs in the A D converter 16 especially when the input analog signal is of low level, the quantization noise becomes distortion which has a relationship with the input signal, and therefore, when the frquency is low, such as in the case of vocal sounds, a problem would arise because harmful distortion uncomfortable for ears occurs. In order to resolve the above mentioned drawbacks.in the signal processing circuit having an A D converter, a technique of superposing a white noise wideband noise signal on the input analog signal has been taken hitherto.When such a countermeasure is taken, although the above mentioned distortion can be reduced, there has been a problem that S N was deterorated because noise in the signal increased. In order to resolve the above mentioned problem, there has been proposed a technique that a noise signal, which resides in a range between the input analog signal frequency range and the side band of the sampling signal, is superposed on the input analog signal as shown inFig. 2. The arrangement of Fig. 2 differs from that of Fig. 1, in that an adder 26 is interposed between the low pass filter 12 and the sample and hold circuit 14, while the adder 26 is arranged to receive the abovementioned noise signal from a noise signal generator 28.Fig. 2 only shows a main part of the signal processing device, and the same elements as in Fig. 1 are designated at like numerals. In the already known apparatus of Fig. 2, the sample and hold circuit 14 is supplied with the output signal of the adder 26, i.e. the input analog signal on which the noise signal generated by the noise siganl generator 28 has been superposed, and if the noise signal generated by the noise siganl generator 28 is arranged such that its range is between the input analog signal frequency range and the side band of the sampling signal, it is possible to reduce the distortion under the condition that deterioration of S N is relatively samll. However, according to the conventional technique of Fig. 2, it is necessary to produce the noise signal, which occupies an extremely narrow band between the input analog signal range and the side band of the sampling signal, as the signal to be superimposed on the input analog signal. Such a noise signal can be ha ly produced. Furthermore, it has a drawback that deterioration of S N is inevitable because the noise signal necessarily falls in the band of the analog signal, wh le it leads to high cost because the device becomes complex, for instance, an AGC circuit is required for generating a constant level noise signal. Reference is now made to Fig. 3, which shows a schematic block diagram of a main part of a first embodiment of the signal processing device according to the present invention. In Fig. 3, a reference numeral 10 is an input terminal of an analog signal 26, an adder 14, a sample and hold circuit 16, ant.A D converter and 30, an auxiliary signal generator.Fig. 3 shows only a main part of the, signal processing device, and therefore, the output terminal of theA D converter 16 may be connected to a suitable circuit, such as the recording medium 18 or a transmission line of Fig.. 1. The sample and hold circuit 14 and theA D converter 16 are supplied, with a given timing control signal in the same manner as in the conventional devices, and the timing control signal is also fed to the auxiliary signal generator 30. In the sample and hold circuit 14, an analog signal applied thereto is sampled by a sampling signal Ps whose frequency is f5, and the sampled values are held until next sampling to deliver an output signal to the A D converter 16. The A D converter 16 converts the amplitude values the sampled values obtained by the sampe and hold circuit 14 into corresponding digital signals to emit them. It is a matter of course that the conversion time of the A D converter 16 is shorter than the sampling period 1 f5 in the sample and hold circuit 14, and digital signal outputs, which have been coded at the sampling period I f , will be emitted from the A D converter 16. The auxiliary signal generator 30 is used for generating an auxiliary signal Pa having a frequency which equals one half the frequency f5 of the sampling signal Ps.The auxiliary signal Pa to be generated by the auxiliary signal generator 30 may assume any waveforms if its frequency is one half the frequency of the sampling frequency f . In the case, that the auxiliary signal Pa S is of a square wave, the auxiliary signal generator 30 may be constructed of a divide by two frequency divider.Since the auxiliary signal generator 30 may be constructed of such a simple frequency divider, it is advantageous that the entire device can be readily manufactured, while its manufacturing cost is low, and the device is samll in size. Furthermore, when such a square wave signal is used as the auxiliary signal Pa, the adjustment of the phasic relationship between the auxiliary signal Pa and the sampling signal Ps can be readily effected so that the difference between adjacent sampled values resulted from continuous sampling equals the peak value of the auxiliary signal Pa, because the amplitude of such a square wave signal is constant for a given period of time. Although the amplitude of the auxiliary signalPa may be freely determined, if the auxiliary signalPa is produced in such a manner that the difference between adjacent sampled values resulted from adjacent samplings is expressed in terms of 2n l QS, wherein 2 n O, 1, 2, 3 . . , and QS is a quantum step unit amplitude of quantization steps , the quantization distortion reduction effect by means of the auxiliary signal Pa becomes the most remarkable. An analog signal to be converted into a digital signal is applied via the input terminal 10 to a first input terminal of the adder.26, while the above mentioned auxiliary signal Pa is applied to a second input terminal of the adder 26. The analog signal from the low pass filter is designated at a reference Sa. With this arrangemet, the auxiliary signal Pa is superposed on the analog signal.Sa in the adder 26, and then the added or superposed signal is fed to the sample and hold circuit 14 to be sampled by the sampling signal Ps having the above mentioned given frequency 5. The sampled data will be fed to the A D converter 16 in the same manner as in the conventional deVices. ow, the way of reducing quantization distortion will be described in detail with reference to Figs. 4A to 4D hereinbelow. First, Fig. 4C shows the sampling timing by the sampling signal Ps, and Fig. 4B is a waveform chart of the auxiliary signal Pa in the case that a square wave is used as the auxiliary sIgnal Pa. Fig. 4A shows the condition that the auxiliary signal Pa is superposed on the analog signal SÅa by adding the auxiliary signal Pa illustrated in Fig. 4B to the analog signal Sa emitted from the low pass filter 12. The signal shown in Fig. 4A is sampled sequentially at the sampling timing of the sampling signal Ps in the sample and hold circuit 14, and the sampled values are held for a single sampling period to be converted into a digital signal in theA D converter 16. The steps at the left side of Fig. 4A shows the quantization characteristic in the A D converter 16, and the height of one step thereof corresponds to the above mentioned quantum step unit amplitude QS. Fig. 4D is a chart for explaining that the quantization distortion is more reduced in the case that the signal obtained by superposing the auxiliary signal Pa on the analog signal Sa is applied via the sample and hold circuit 14 to the A D converter 16 compared to the case that only the analog signal Sa of Fig. 4A is simply applied to the sample and hold circuit 14.A light curve I and a heavy curve II respectively show the condition that the output signal from the A D converter 16 is restored to an analog signal by the D A converter 20 shown in Fig. 1. Namely, the curve I indicates the output signal from the D A converter 20 in the case that only the analog signal Sa is applied to the A D converter 16, while the curve II indicates the waveform of the output signal. from the D A converter 20 in the case that the signal obtained by superposing m in the auxiliary signal Pa on the analog signal Sa is applied to the A D converter 16. A dot dash lineFig. 4D indicates the waveform of the output signal of the low pass filter 22 of Fig. 1, which output signal is obtained when the signal reprsented by the heavy curve II is applied from the D A converter 20 thereto. As is apparent from the curve II of Fig. 4D, since the auxiliary signval Pa having a frequency fs 2, which equals one half the frequency f of the sampling signal Ps, is superposed on the analog signal Sa in the present invention, there occurs a region Z in which values of adjacent quantization steps appear alternatively in the output signal of the D A converter 20. The output signal from the D A converter 20 shows the substantial quantization characterisitc in the A D converter 16 in the case that the auxiliary signal Pa is syperposed on the analog signal Sa.Since the signal level variation in the range Z of the output signal from the D A converter 20, as shown by the curve II, is caused by the auxiliary signal Pa, the frequency of the above mentioned signal level variation equals the frequency fas 2 of the auxiliary signal Pa. On the other hand, the cutoff frequency fc of the low. pass filter 22, which filters the output signal of the D A converter 20, is selected as f f 2, c S so that the level variation, which has occured in the region Z of the output signal of the D A converter 20, does not pass through the low pass filter 22. Accordingly, an average value will be emitted because it is integrated by the interpolation effect of the low pass filter 22. The way of level variation in the region Z of the output signal from the above mentioned D A converter 20 is such that the level assumes two values of the quantization steps during a single sampling period l f5 , and therefore, the signal in the region Z is emitted as an average value after integrated by the low pass filter 22.. This means that the way of the above mentioned processing is equivalent to the condition that the signal in the region Z has been quantized by means of a new quantum step which has been additionally set between two adjacent quantum steps in the A D converter 16.Therefore, the signal represented by the curver III of Fig. 4D, namely, the signal obtained by passing the output signal of curveII of Fig. 4D through the low pass filter 22, is equivalent to a signal which will be obtained when the A D converter 16 operates in accordance with a quantlzation characteristic having an additional quantum step beween original quantum steps which have been set in the A D converter 16. This means that the device according to the present invention provides an improvement by one bit in the resolving power with respect to a low.frequency, low level signal, and thus quantization distortion can be reduced according to the present invention compared to the conventional device. Since the auxiliary signal Pa is synchronized with the sampling signal Ps, no aliasing noise occurs, producing a constant level d.c. component even though the auxiliary signal Pa includes harmonic components.Accordingly, S N would not be deteriorated even though the amplitude of the auxiliary signal Pa is selected 2n 1 such that the value of n in 2 QS is made equal to or greater than 1. Consequently, by setting the value of n as n 1, improvement in linearity of the A D converter 16 can be achieved because of the averaging operation of the quantum steps without deterorating S N of the objective signal. In addition to the above mentioned auxiliary signal Pa, if a conventionally practiced dither signal noise signal is also superposed, reduction of quantization distortion can be further satisfactorily performed, and in this case, the level of the noise signal is required to be only one half the level of the conventional one, and thus deterioration of S N can be reduced accordingly. .Hence reference is now made to Fig. 6 which illustrates a second embodiment of the present invention.The second embodiment differs from the first embodiment of Fig. 3 in that a dither signal generator 34 for producing the above mentioned dither signal to be superposed on the input analog signal, and an additional adder 32 for effecting the superposition are additionally employed. In detail, the input, terminal 10 is connected to a first input terminal of the adder 32, whose second input terminal is connected to the output of the dither signal generator 34. The output terminal of the adder 32 is connected to the input terminal of the low pass filter 12.With this arrangement, the dither signal is superposed on the input analog signal prior to applying the analog signal via the low filter 12 to the adder 26 in which the analog signal will be added to the auxiliary signal Pa. In the above, although it has been described in connection with embodiments in which the input analog signal is converted in the A D converter 16 after the analog signal is sampled and held in the sample andhold circuit 14, it is a matter of course that the present invention may be satisfactorily adapted two a case that the arrangement is such that the analog signal is directly applied to the A D converter 16 to convert the analog signal into a digital signal in the case that the variation in magnitude of the analog signal within the conversion time of the A D converter 16 is smaller than a single quantum step, the analog signal has been directly applied ta the A D converter 16 without using a sample and hold circuit hitherto . In the above case, the frequency of the sampling signal used in the abovedescription may be considered to correspond to the frequency of converting operation of the A D converter 16. Figs. SA to D are charts for comparing the inputoutput characteristics between the conventional device and the device according to the present invention, andFig. 5A shows the input analog signal Sa, where steps at the left side of the drawing shows the quantization characterisitc Fig. SB is a waveform chart of the output signal in the case that quantization distortion reduction is not performed Fig. 5C is a waveform chart of the output signal in the case that the noise signal is superposed and Fig. 5D is a waveform chart of the output signal in the device according to the present invention. As will be apparent from the foregoing description, in the signal processing device according to the present invention, the virtual resolving power has been increased by one bit in the low frequency range, which tends to become a problem particularly, without deteriorating the S Nof the signal. Thus the present invention is capable of readily providing a signal processing device which is simple in construction and has satisfactory characteristics, and therefore, conventional problems can be satisfactorily resolved. The above described embodiments are just examples of the present invention, and therefore, it will be apparent for those skilled in the art that many modifications and variations may be made without departing from the spirit of the present invention.
