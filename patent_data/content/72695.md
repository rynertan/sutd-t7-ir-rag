## Description
The present invention relates to chemically sensitized silver chlorobromide photographic emulsions. Silver chlorobromide photographic emulsions have better developability than silver iodobromide emulsions and are conventionally used in printing photosensitive materials or color paper. Since they have low sensitivity, silver chlorobromide emulsions must be used as large grains to achieve higher sensitivity, but increased grain size impairs their lack of graininess and developability. Chemical sensitization is commonly used to increase the sensitivity of silver halide photographic emulsions, and conventional methods of chemical sensitization include sulfur sensitization, gold sensitization and reduction sensitization which are generally used either alone or in combination. It is known that the combination of sulfur sensitization and gold sensitization achieves a higher sensitivity than sulfur sensitization alone, but this combination is not practical for the purpose of sensitizing silver halide photographic emulsions substantially made of silver chlorobromide since excess fog results. Therefore, it has long been desired to develop a method of sulfur sensitization that can effectively sensitize silver chlorobromide photographic emulsions without the help of gold sensitization. The object of the present invention is to provide a process for chemical sensitizing a silver chlorobromide photographic emulsion that has high sensitivity and less fog. According to the present invention there is provided a process for chemical sensitizing a silver halide photographic emulsion having silver halide grains that consists essentially of silver chlorobromide, characterised by adding to the emulsion a sulphur sensitiser but not a gold sensitiser and, during chemical ripening, a silver halide solvent. The silver halide solvent used in the present invention is a compound that reacts with silver halides to form water soluble sliver salts if it is a sulfur containing compound it should not form silver sulfide. Preferred examples are ammonium thiocyanate or alkali metal salts of thiocyanic acid e.g. potassium thiocyanate and sodium thiocyanate and thiourea derivatives i.e. tetra substituted ureas such as tetra methyl thiourea that do not form silver sulfide upon reaction with silver salts . Other suitable examples are compounds which are capable of forming complexes with silver halides they include ammonia, amine derivatives e.g. triethylenetetramine , nitrogen containing heterocyclic compounds such as pyridine and imidazole, as well as derivatives thereof. Typical, but by no means limiting, examples of the silver halide solvent used in the present invention are listed below. The silver halide solvent used in the present invention is added during the chemical ripening of silver chlorobromide photographic emulsions. The solvent may be added in admixture with a sulfur sensitizer but more preferably the solvent and sulfur sensitizer are added separately the order of their addition is not critical. The amount of the sliver halide solvent added varies widely with the solvent type and the intended effect of its addition generally, the solvent is used in an amount ranging from 1 x 10 ⁵ to 1 x 10 ¹ mole per mole of silver chlorobromide, and preferably, it is used in an amount of 1 x 10 ⁴ to 1 x 10 ² mole per mole of silver chlorobromide. The sulfur sensitizer used in the present invention is a compound that reacts with silver halides to form silver sulfide eventually. Suitable sulfur sensitizers include thiosulfates e.g. sodium thiosulfate , thiazoles, rhodamines and thioureas. These compounds are generally used in an amount of from 10 ⁴ to 10 ⁶ mole per mole of silver halide but the exact amount varies with their type. According to the present invention, the chemical sensitization may be combined with reduction sensitization. A suitable method of reduction sensitization is by silver ripening or by using a reduction sensitizer. Suitable reduction sensitizers include stannous salts, amines, hydrazine derivatives, formamidine sulfinic acids and silane compounds. Reduction sensitization with these compounds may be effected on the surface or in the interior of silver halide grains. For the purposes of the present invention, chemical sensitization is generally effected at a pH in the range of from 4 to 9. The sensitization temperature ranges generally from 40 to 80 C, preferably from 40 to 60 C. The silver halide grains used in the present invention consist essentially of silver chlorobromide, and for the purposes of providing increased developability and sensitivity and reducing fog, the grains preferably contain at least 50 mol of silver bromide, not more than 2 mol of silver iodide and at least 0.5 mol of silver chloride. The average size of the silver chlorobromide grains in the emulsion as measured by the diameter if the grains are spherical or pseudo spherical, and the length of one side if the grains are cubic, both expressed in terms of the projected area is not critical but the preferred value is not more than 3 µm. The grain size distribution may be narrow or broad. The silver chlorobromide grains in the photographic emulsion may have regularly shaped, say, cubic or octahedral, crystals or they may have irregularly shaped, say, spherical or tabular, crystals. Alternatively, the crystals may be combinations of these shapes. The grains may be a mixture of ones having various crystal shapes. The grains may have different phases between the interior and the surface, or they may possess a uniform phase. The photographic emulsion used in the present invention can be prepared by any of the methods described in P. Glafkides, Chimie et Physique Photographique , Paul Montel, 1967, G.F. Duffin, Photographic Emulsion Chemistry , The Focal Press, 1966 and V.L. Zelikman at al., Making and Coating Photographic Emulsion , The Focal Press, 1964. That is, the emulsion may be prepared by an acid process, neutral process or ammonia process. Soluble silver salts may be reacted with soluble halide salts by the single jet method, double jet method or a combination thereof. The reverse mixing method wherein silver halide grains are formed in the presence of excess silver ions may also be used. The controlled double jet method wherein the solution for forming silver halide grains is kept at a constant level of pAg may be used, and this method is effective for producing a silver halide emulsion comprising grains of a substantially uniform size having regular crystal shapes. The conversion method of the type described in U.S. Patent No. 2,592,250 wherein silver salt grains having a higher solubility than silver bromide is first prepared and then at least one part of the grains is converted to a silver bromide salt may be used in the present invention. But more preferably, the silver chlorobromide emulsion is prepared without using such conversion method.. Two or more silver halide emulsions that have been prepared separately may be combined. The silver halide grains may be formed or the produced silver halide grains may be ripened physically in the presence of cadmium salts, zinc salts, lead salts, thallium salts, iridium salts or their complex salts, as well as rhodium salts or their complex salts, and iron salts or their complex salts, for example. The photographic emulsion used in the present invention may be sensitized spectrally with methine dyes or other dyes. Suitable dyes include cyanine dyes, merocyanine dyes, complex cyanine dyes, complex merocyanine dyes, homopolar cyanine dyes, hemicyanine dyes, styryl dyes and hemioxonol dyes. Particularly advantageous dyes are cyanine dyes, merocyanine dyes and complex merocyanine dyes. These dyes may contain any of the basic heterocyclic nuclei usually contained in the cyanine dyes, such as the pyrroline nucleus, oxazoline nucleus, thiazoline nucleus, pyrrole nucleus, oxazole nucleus, thiazole nucleus, selenazole nucleus, imidazole nucleus, terrazole nucleus and pyridine nucleus. These nuclei may be fused to alicyclic hydrocarbon rings or aromatic hydrocarbon rings to form an indolenine nucleus, benzoindolenine nucleus, indole nucleus, benzoxazole nucleus, naphthoxazole nucleus, benzothiazole nucleus, naphthothiazole nucleus, benzoselenazole nucleus, benzoimidazole nucleus and quinoline nucleus. These nuclei may be substituted on the carbon atom. The merocyanine dyes or complex merocyanine dyes may contain five or six membered heterocyclic nuclei having a ketomethylene structure, such as the pyrazoline 5 one nucleus, thiohydantoin nucleus, 2 thioxazolidine 2,4 dione nucleus, thiazolidine 2,4 dione nucleus, rhodanine nucleus and thiobarbituric acid nucleus.

The photographic emulsion used in the present invention is used for multi layered color paper with particular advantage. Photographic materials for color paper are more sensitive to fog than other photographic materials, so the emulsion that reduces fogging while achieving higher sensitivity is best suited for use in color paper. The photosensitive material with a coating of the emulsion used in the present invention is then exposed to form a photographic image. Any conventional method of exposure can be used, and many known light sources are applicable for this purpose, such as natural light, tungsten lamp, fluorescent lamp, mercury lamp, xenon arc lamp, carbon arc lamp, xenon flash lamp and CRT flying spot. The exposure time is from 1 1000 to 1 second long as is the usual case for cameras, or it may be as short as 1 x 10 ⁶ to 1 x 10 ⁹ second if a xenon flash lamp or CRT is used. An exposure time longer than 1 second may also be used. If necessary, a color filter may be used to modulate the spectrum of light for exposure. Other light sources indude a laser, as well as objects that emit light when excited by electron beams, X rays, gamma rays and alpha rays. The photosensitive material made from the emulsion used in the present invention can be processed by any of the known methods, such as those described in Product Licensing Index, vol. 92, page 110, Processing . The present invention is now described in greater detail by reference to the following examples which are given here for illustrative purposes only and are by no means intended to limit its scope. A silver chlorobromide emulsion 90 mol of silver bromide comprising cubic grains having an average size of 0.6 µm was prepared by the controlled double jet method wherein the pAg value was held at 5.5. The emulsion was divided into five equal portions E₁ to E₅ , and the compounds listed in Table 1 below were added to the respective portions in the amounts indicated in the same table. The mixtures were ripened at a pH value of 6.0 and 50 C for 60 minutes, and the resulting emulsions were coated onto cellulose acetate supports to give a silver coating weight of 50 mg 100 cm² and a gelatin coating weight of 30 mg 100 cm². The coated samples were exposed to a tungsten lamp 400 lux through an optical wedge for a period of 1 100 second, and developed with a black and white developing solution of the following composition at 20 C for 5 minutes. KOH and water to make 1000 ml at pH 10.0 The amounts of the additives indicated in Table 1 are based on 1 mol of Ag. The photographic sensitivities of the respective samples were measured at a given density optical density 0.1 higher than the fog density, and the minimum densities of the samples were also measured. The results are shown in Table 1. Sulfur sensitization in the presence of silver halide solvents i.e. potassium thiocyanate and tetramethyl thiourea achieved much higher sensitivities than sensitization with hypo alone. The table also shows that thiocyanate salts and tetra substituted thiourea were particularly effective among the silver halide solvents. A silver chlorobromide emulsion 80 mol of silver bromide comprising octahedral grains having an average size of 0.6 µm was prepared by the controlled double jet method wherein the pAg value was held at 8.0. The emulsion was divided into six equal portions E₆ E₁₁ , and the compounds listed in Table 2 below were added to the respective portions in the amounts indicated in the same table. The mixtures were ripened at a pH value of 6.0 and 50 C for 80 minutes, and the resulting emulsions were applied onto resincoated paper supports to give a silver coating weight of 10 mg 100 cm² and a gelatin coating weight of 50 mg 100 cm², together with a Y coupler compound A indicated below that was applied in a coating weight of 15 mg 100 cm². The coated samples were exposed to a tungsten lamp 400 lux through an optical wedge for a period of 1 100 second, and processed by the following procedures with the following agents. The amounts of the additives indicated in Table 2 are based on 1 mol of Ag. The silver chlorobromide emulsion comprising octahedral grains could be effectively sensitized without fog according to the present invention. Octadedral silver bromide gains having an average size of 0.3 µm were prepared by the controlled double jet method wherein the pAg value was held at 8.0. Silver nitrate was added and the mixture was ripened at a pAg value of 3.0 and 60 C for 60 minutes. A silver chlorobromide emulsion 80 mol of silver bromide comprising octahedral grains having an average size of 0.6 µm was prepared from the ripened mixture by the controlled double jet method wherein the pAg value was held at 8.0. The emulsion was divided into three equal portions E₁₂ to E₁₄ , and 50 mg of a sensitizing dye compound B indicated below per mole of Ag, 100 mg of a stabilizer compound C indicated below per mole of Ag, and the compounds indicated in Table 3 below were added to the respective portions in the amounts indicated in the same table. The mixtures were ripened at 50 C for 100 minutes, and the resulting emulsions were applied to resin coated paper supports to give a silver coating weight of 10 mg 100 cm² and a gelatin coating weight of 50 mg 100 cm², together with a mixture of M coupler compound D indicated below in dibutyl phthalate with M coupler protect dispersed in aqueous gelatin total M coupler coating weight 30 mg 100 cm² . The coated samples were exposed to green light through an optical wedge and subsequently processed as in Example 2. The amounts of the additives indicated in Table 3 are based on 1 mol of Ag. The table shows that the present invention was also effective for color sensitized photographic materials. A silver chlorobromide emulsion 180 mol of silver bromide comprising octahedral grains having an average size of 0.8 µm was prepared by the controlled double jet method wherein the pAg value was held at 8.0. The emulsion was divided into two equal portions E₁₅ and E₁₆ . Octahedral silver chlorobromide grains 60 mol of silver bromide having an average size of 0.8 µm were prepared by the controlled double jet method wherein the pAg value was held at 8.0 and converted to silver chlorobromide grains with a silver bromide content of 80 mol , and the resulting emulsion was divided into two equal portions E₁₇ and E₁₈ . To the respective emulsions, 50 mg of a sensitizing dye compound B indicated above per mole of Ag, 10 mg of a stabilizer compound C also indicated above per mole of Ag, and the compounds listed in Table 4 below were added in the amounts indicated in the same table, and the mixtures were ripened at 50 C for 90 minutes and applied to resin coated paper supports as in Example 3. The so coated samples were exposed to green light through an optical wedge and subsequently processed as in Example 2. The amounts of the additives indicated in Table 4 are based on 1 mol of Ag. The advantage of the present invention was also apparent when the silver chlorobromide emulsion was prepared without using the conversion method.
