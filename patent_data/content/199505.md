# A BOTTLE CARRIER

## Abstract
A carrier 10 for a bottle comprises a plurality of containers 11 each having side walls 12,13,15,16 upstand ing from a corresponding basal edge 19,20,21,22 of an inverted pyramidal base portion 18 . When a bottle is received in a container 11 , weight of the bottle causes walls 23 of the base portion 18 thereof to diverge one from another with a result that the side walls 12,13,15,16 converge towards and firmly engage the bottle.
