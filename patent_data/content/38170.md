# Mechanical seal with improved face ring mounting.

## Abstract
A mechanical seal construction having an annular face ring 44 , preferably of hard material such as tungsten or sili con carbide, interference fitted within an annular flange 43 formed on a seal ring 42 . One of the face and seal rings 44 and 42 is undercut so that the effective holding force between the flange and the face ring, as created by the interference fit, acts effectively only at, or at least adjacent, the central trans verse plane of the face ring 44 to substantially prevent distor tion of the face ring 44 . The inner end face 51 of the face ring 44 is axially spaced from the opposed end face 52 on the seal ring 42 , so that the face ring 44 is supported on and engaged with the seal ring 42 solely by the engagement there between substantially along the central transverse plane. Tool receiving grooves 62, 66 are provided to permit removal of the face ring 44 from the seal ring 42 .
