# A PROCESS FOR PREPARING CATHODE MASS FOR NON AQUEOUS ELECTROCHEMICAL CELLS, A CATHODE MASS FOR USE IN SUCH CELLS AND CELLS INCORPORATING THE CATHODE MASS

## Abstract
There is described a process of making cathode mass for a non aqueous electrochemical cell having an active metal anode. The process involves reducing a non stoichiometric cathode active material, e.g. iron sulphide, with an active metal, e.g. Li, or a precursor of an active metal, e.g. Li‚ÇÉN, to produce a cathode mass comprising stoichiometric active material, a compound of the active metal with the element of the non stoichiometric active material in excess, and at most 40 mole percent, based on the non stoichiometric starting material, of a chemical species resulting from the reduction of the active cathode material. The cathode mass gives rise to stable voltages when connected to an external circuit.
