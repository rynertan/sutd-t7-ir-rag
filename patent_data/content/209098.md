# AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEM

## Abstract
The present invention comprises an axial flow compres sor 12 and an impeller 40 in fluid communication on a common rotable shaft 16 with an inlet fan 14 and drive pulley 18 . The compressor 12 and impeller 40 are each dischargeable into a cooling heating tube 52 . An air sepa ration device 70 at the downstream end of the cooling heating tube 52 draws cool air from the axially central part of the cooling heating tube 52 , and it draws hot air from adjacent the inner walls of the cooling heating tube 52 . The different streams of air may be selectively conducted to the interior of an automobile to function as an air condi tioner, a defroster or the like. The compressor 12 , impeller 40 and inlet fan 14 may be empowered by rotative means such as an automobile engine.
