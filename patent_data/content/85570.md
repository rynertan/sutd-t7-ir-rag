# VIBRATION MONITORING SYSTEM FOR AIRCRAFT ENGINES

## Abstract
A vibration monitoring sytem for aircraft engines in cludes a nonrecursive digital filter network 22 controlled by a data processor 16 . A signal from accelerometers 1,2 are passed through a circuit 36 for sampling analogue signals under the control of sampling signals. Digital techniques process tachometer signals to generatate sampling signals at a frequency which is an integral multiple of the rotating frequency. The digital filter 22 can track the rotational frequency of the rotating component and can be accurately centred on that frequency. The digital filter includes a pair of memories 82, 88 which respectively store sampled data and constant coefficients. The sampled data storage can accom modate the output of more than one sensor and data from each sensor can be alternately processed.
