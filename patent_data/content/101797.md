# RADIATION IMAGABLE COMPOSITIONS

## Abstract
A radiation imagable composition in which an image can be produced upon exposure to intense radiation is disclosed which comprises a at least one component selected from the group consisting of clay and barium sulfate, and b a binder material which will not be destroyed during exposure of the composition to intense radiation and will not mask the image produced upon exposure to intense radiation.
