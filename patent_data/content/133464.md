# Iodothyronine immunoassays employing HMS as TBP blocking agent.

## Abstract
An improved immunoassay method, reagent means, test kit, and test device for determining an iodothyronine, e.g., thyroxine T 4 , in a biological fluid, usually serum or plasma, wherein 2 hydroxy 4 methoxy benzophenone 5 sulfonic acid HMS , or a salt thereof, is employed as a blocking agent for the binding of iodothyronines to thyroxine binding protein TBP . The present invention is particularly advantageous as applied to homogeneous competitive bind ing iodothyronine immunoassays employing labels which are participants in enzyme catalyzed reactions. Such labels include enzyme substrates, coenzymes, enzyme inhibitors, enzyme prosthetic groups, and enzymes.
