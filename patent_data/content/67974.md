# Torque sensor.

## Abstract
A torque sensor device for sensing the torque applied to a drive shaft and for producing an electrical signal represen tative of the applied torque is disclosed. The sensor includes a non magnetic drive shaft having a magnetic layer affixed to its outer surface. The magnetic permeability of the magnetic layer changes due to torque applied to the shaft. The permeability of the magnetic layer is detected and converted to an electrical signal representative of the torque applied to the drive shaft. The magnetic layer takes the form of one or more elongated ribbons of magnetic material helically wound about the surface of the drive shaft. Alternatively, the magnetic layer is formed from a plurality of segments of magnetic material affixed to the periphery of the shaft. Magnetically soft amorphous metal material is preferably used to form the magnetic layer.
