# Photopolymerizable mixtures and methods of making viscoelastic and pressure sensitive adhesive products therewith.

## Abstract
A mixture of alkyl acrylate and or methacrylate with an addition polymerization initiator photopolymerizes when exposed to ultraviolet radiation in an inert atmosphere. By adding an oxidizable tin salt such as stannous octoate, the mixture can be photopolymerized in air to a coatable viscos ity, and greater tolerance of oxygen is permitted in carrying the photopolymerization to completion than could be toler ated in prior processes. The invention is primarily useful in making pressure sensitive adhesive tapes.
