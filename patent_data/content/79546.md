# NUMERICALLY CONTROLLED AUTOMATIC TOOL CHANGING MACHINING CENTER HAVING A BAR TYPE SPINDLE

## Abstract
A numerically controlled automatic tool changing machining center is provided with a rotary driven spindle concentric within which is a spindle bar that may be reciprocated out from or into the spindle by a hydraulic cylinder. Located at the forward end of the spindle bar is a tool receiving socket which is operative to releasably engage the shank of a single toolholder or multiple spindle toolhead transferred to the spindle bar from the machine tool storage magazine by a tool transfer arm. When a large, single toolholder is engaged by the spindle bar, the spindle bar is retracted into the spindle to urge the large single toolholder against the nose of the spindle. In the case of a multiple spindle toolhead being engaged by the spindle bar, the spindle bar is retracted into the spindle to urge the multiple spindle toolhead against the spindlehead so that locating pins extending rearwardly from the multiple spindle tool head body seat in complementary locating cones spaced about the spindle on spindlehead to secure the multiple spindle toolhead body against rotation.
