## Description
TITLE SEA WATER DESALINATION PROCESS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Permselective separation processes such as dialysis, ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis have long been used for the separation of impurities from aqueous mixtures and the. desalination of brackish and sea waters. A continuing problem in the use of reverse osmosis membranes is the build up of fouling layers of clays, salts, and anhydrous heavy metal oxides The build up of fouling layers typically reduces water flux through the reverse osmosis membranes and increases the salt passage. In many reverse osmosis applications, treatment of a membrane with aqueous solutions of hydrolyzable tannin provides a significant reduction in salt passage for a fouled membrane.However, these techniques have heretofore been considered inapplicable to processes for the purification of sea water, since the addition of hydrolyzable tannin solution to normal sea water results in the formation of a precipitate which aggravates the fouling of the permeator. Summary of the Invention The instant invention provides an improved process for the treatment of sea water in a reverse osmosis permeator which overcomes the difficulties previously encountered in the use of a hydrolyzable tannin solution. Specifically, the instant invention provides, in the process for reducing the salinity of sea water by contacting a permselective structure with the sea water under a pressure greater than the osmotic pressure of the sea water, the improvement comprising adding to the sea water a acid in an amount sufficient to reduce the pH of the sea water to less than about 5.0 and b about from 5 to 80 mg l of a solution of hydrolyzable tannin. Detailed Description of the Invention The permselective membranes which can be used in the instant invention include any of the several compositions and types known in the art, and can be used in the form of flat films, coatings and porous substrates in sheet or tubular form or as thin walled, hollow capillaries or fibers. The membranes are preferably made of synthetic organic polymers and have asymetric structures such as those described in U.S. Patents 3,133,132 and 3,567,632, both hereby incorporated by reference. Asymetric, polymeric membranes have on one surface a relatively thin skin of dense polymer and on the other surface a relatively more porous, more thick and less dense supporting structure and have permselected properties dependent on the direction of passage of the permeate through the structure . The instant process is particularly adapted for the treatment of sea water. The term sea water, as used herein, is understood to have its normal meaning. In general, sea water will have a salt concentration of at least about 25,000 milligrams per liter of which sodium chloride and magnesium chloride are the principal components. For purposes of testing the present invention, synthetic sea water, having a salt concentration of 35,000 milligrams per liter of a variety of six salts, is used. This synthetic sea water is prepared according to the specification of ASTM D 1141 52. According to the instant invention, acid is added to the sea water used as a feed for the reverse osmosis permeator, in an amount sufficient to reduce the pH of the sea water to less than about 5.0. In general, a pH of from about 2 to 5 is used and a sea water feed having a pH of about from 3 to 4 is particularly preferred, A wide variety of acids can be used to adjust the pH, so long as the acid exhibits sufficient solubility to reduce the pH to the desired level and is chemically compatible with the membrane in the desired pH range. Sulfuric, hydrochloric and citric acids are particularly convenient for use in the instant process, and citric acid is especially preferred because of its easy handling and convenient storage. In accordance with the present invention, a solution of hydrolyzable tannin is added to the sea water feed adjusted to a pH of less than about 5.0. The hydrolyzable tannins suitable for use in treating the perinselective membranes in accordance with the present invention are conveniently obtained by extracting leaves, twigs, bark, fruit and gall from trees and plants. The term hydrolyzable means that the tannin can be hydrolyzed with hydrolytic agents such as acids, alkali, hot water or enzymes to obtain gallic acid such tannins are gallotannins or ellagic acid such tannins are ellagitannins . Such tannins are common, well known compositions and are discussed extensively in Chemistry of VegetableTannins by Haslam, Academic Press, London 1966, pp.91 125, hereby incorporated by reference. Particular hydrolyzable tannins are usually identified from the source tree or plant of extraction, as, for example, chinese gall tannic acid , mimosa tannins, quebracho tannins, wattle tannins, chestnut tannins, eucalyptus tannins, tea extract tannins, and the like. In general, such tannins can be structurally characterized as hydrolyzable mixtures of complex polyphenolic substances having molecular weights in the range of 900 3000. They can be obtained by leeching leaves, galls, fruits, bark, and the like, with acetone and or water, followed by extraction of the resulting solution with ethyl acetate, and evaporation of the ethyl acetate. The preferred tannin for use in this invention is tannic acid. This tannin is obtained from the extraction of oak and sumac nut galls and is an amorphous powder occurring as glistening scales or spongy masses varying in color from yellow white to light brown. The solution of hydrolyzable tannin is used in a concentration of about from 5 to 80 milligrams per liter and preferably about from 10 to 20 milligrams per liter. In general, a pressure during treatment of about from 5500 to 7,000 kPa can be used The treatment is generally conducted t a temperature range of from about 0 to 350C. The treatment with the hydrolyzable tannin solution or tannic acid is generally conducted at such frequency as is necessary to maintain the performance characteristics of the membrane at the desired level. In general, the treatment is conducted for a period of about from 10 to 60 minutes, and preferably about from 10 to 30 minutes for every 500 1000 hours of operating time. The instant invention provides a process which is applicable to the treatment of permeators used for the desalination of sea water and which is equally as effective as the previous processes which required removal of the permeator from operation. At the same time, the instant process can be used with sea water without the precipitation and fouling previously encountered in such treatment. The invention is further illustrated by the following specific examples.Example 1 A commercially available reverse osmosis permeator was operated on a 35,000 mg l synthetic seawater feed solution, prepared according to ASTMD 1141 52, at 5515 kPa feed pressure, 250C and 30 conversion. The salt passage was 0.96 . A solution containing tannic acid 1056 mg l plus citric acid 27,000 mg l was injected into the seawater feed stream at such a rate to obtain 20 mg l tannic acid and 500 mg l citric in the seawater feed solution.This resulted in a feed pH of 3.4. After 30 minutes of treatment, the injection was stopped and after about 15 minutes of further operation the salt passage had decreased to 0.60 . No change in the product flow was observed. Example 2 The general procedure of Example 1 was repeated, except that the permeator had a initial salt passage of 2.70 and the treatment solution used was 10 mg l tannic acid plus 500 mg l citric acid.After 30 minutes of treatment, the injection was stopped and the salt passage had decreased to 0.67 . Example 3 The general procedure of Example 2 was repeated, except that 500 mg l of NaHSO3 was added to the seawater feed along with the tannic acid and citric acid. A salt passage before and after treatment was 2.48 and 0.66 , respectively.Example 4 The general procedure of Example 3 was repeated, except that hydrochloric acid instead of citric acid was added to the seawater feed in an amount to lower the pH to 2.5. The salt passage before and after treatment was 2.56 and 0.80 , respectively.Example 5 The general procedure of Example 2 was repeated, except that 200 mg l of citric acid was used instead of the 500 mg l used in Example 2. The pH of the seawater feed during treatment varied between 4.7 and 4.8. The salt passage before and after treatment was 1.44 and 0.88 , respectively.
