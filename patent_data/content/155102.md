# ADJUSTABLE HYDRAULIC DAMPER

## Abstract
A hydraulic damper has a rotor 56 on a piston of the damper rotatable through a plurality of control positions to vary the damping capability of the damper and subject to temporary rotary immobility by pressure spikes in the damper, an actuator 60 within the piston rod 30 of the damper including a solenoid 82 , an input driver 122 rotatable through a plurality of positions corresponding to the control positions of the rotor, a pawl 16 and lever system operable by a plunger 86 to rotate the input driver in stepwise fashion, an intermediate driver 138 rotatable with the input driver, an output driver 152 connected to and rotatable with the rotor, an abutment 142 on the intermediate driver, an arm on the output driver engageable on the abutment, and a torsion spring 177 connected between the intermediate and output drivers and operative to normally hold the arm against the abutment so that the intermediate and output drivers rotate as a unit, and further operative to allow the intermediate driver to rotate relative to the output driver when the rotor is immobilized and then, when rotor mobility returns, to rotate the rotor and the output driver until the arm engages the abutment.
