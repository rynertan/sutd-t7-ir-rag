# A CONNECTING STRUCTURE FOR CONNECTING OPTICAL CONDUCTOR

## Abstract
A connecting structure for connecting optical conductors through which light energy is transmitted. The connecting structure comprises a coupling ring of an inner diameter approximately equal to the outer diameter of the optical conductor rod, an edge surface of the optical conductor rod and that of another optical conductor rod to be connected with it in the coupling ring and being arranged so as to be opposed to each other or an edge surface of the optical conductor rod and that of a large number of the optical fibers being arranged so as to be opposed to each other, the edge surfaces being connected through the use of matching oil or optical paste.
