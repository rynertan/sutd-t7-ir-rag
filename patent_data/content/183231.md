## Description
This invention relates to data processing technology, and more particularly to technology which is especially effective when applied to a microprocessor. A microcomputer system is constructed of a microprocessor, storage devices such as a ROM read only memory and a RAM random access memory , an input output interface I O , etc. In this case, the use of a dynamic one as the RAM is better than the use of a static one because of the merit that the system can be arranged less expensively. Since, however, the dynamic RAM adopts an address multiplexing system and requires a refresh operation, the control thereof is more troublesome than those of the ROM and the static RAM. Therefore, any of prior art microprocessors has been constructed so as to be capable of direct access to the ROM and the static RAM. In case of arranging the system by the use of the dynamic RAM, it has been necessary to dispose complicated external circuits including circuits for forming In this manner, the use of the dynamic RAM for the prior art microprocessor has led to the problems that the design of the system becomes difficult and that the packaging area of the system becomes large. A certain prior art microprocessor has a built in refresh counter which generates the refresh address of the dynamic RAM. Even with such a microprocessor, the EP A 0 080 626 discloses a memory module selection apparatus having the features set forth in the first part of the claim 1. In the known apparatus, provision is made for adding memories of various capacities, and attributive data stored in registers indicate the different capacities. The object of the present invention is to provide a data processor which allows an operation in different addressing modes with respect to a number of external memories. This object is met by the present invention characterized in the main claim. Fig. 1 is a circuit block diagram of one embodiment in the case of applying the present invention to a 16 bit microprocessor. In the figure, a portion enclosed with a chain lime A is formed on a single semiconductor substrate such as single crystal silicon by known semiconductor production technology. In Fig. 1, shown by circuit symbol CPU is a microprocessor portion. Although this microprocessor portion CPU, the practicable arrangement of which is not directly pertinent to the present invention, is not illustrated in detail, it is constructed of, for example, an execution unit EXEC which is composed of an arithmetic logic unit, dedicated registers such as a program counter, a stack pointer, a status register, and general purpose registers for use as work areas, and a controller CONT which is composed of an instruction register to which microprogram instructions read out from an external memory not shown are successively input, micro ROMs in which microinstructions corresponding to respective macroinstructions are stored, and so on. The execution unit EXEC is operated in a proper sequence which is determined by control signals delivered from the controller CONT. Thus, desired data processing is executed. Coupled to the controller CONT are external terminals CT which are supplied with interrupt signals and reset signals. In order to control the operating timings of the microprocessor portion CPU, an oscillator OSC and a clock pulse generator CPG are provided. The oscillator OSC has its oscillation frequency determined by a circuit element, such as quartz vibrator or ceramics vibrator not shown, which is coupled between external terminals XT₁ and XT₂. The clock pulse generator CPG receives the oscillation output of the oscillator OSC and properly divides its frequency, thereby to form a system clock . In this embodiment, on the same semiconductor substrate as that of the microprocessor portion CPU, there are disposed a refresh counter RC which generates a refresh address of a dynamic RAM, an address multiplexor MPX which selects either the address from the refresh counter RC or an address that is delivered from the execution unit EXEC to an address bus line A BUS, and a control signal generator CSG which controls the operation of the address multiplexor MPX. The refresh counter RC is operated by the operating clock signal of the system, and outputs a synchronizing signal When the synchronizing signal Besides, the synchronizing signal According to this embodiment, though it is not especially restricted, a plurality of address spaces to correspond to a plurality of sorts of memories and data indicating the attributes of the respective memories are set in the microprocessor in order to permit the memories to be simultaneously coupled to external address terminals AT. Although not especially restricted, the embodiment is provided for discriminating the plurality of address spaces with two address setting registers AR₁ and AR₂, two comparators COMP₁ and COMP₂ which compare the contents of the address setting registers AR₁ and AR₂ with the address delivered from the microprocessor portion CP onto the address bus A BUS and decide the relations of magnitudes thereof, respectively, and a decision circuit DCD which decides which address range the address signal on the address bus A BUS falls within, by reference to the outputs of the two comparators COMP₁ and COMP₂. Each of the address setting registers AR₁ and AR₂ has its operation controlled by the control signal delivered from the execution unit EXEC of the microprocessor portion CPU, and has address data written therein through a data bus D BUS. The data to be written into the address setting registers AR₁ and AR₂ is stored along with programs to be executed by the shown microprocessor, in an unshown ROM the address terminals of which are coupled to the external address bus lines A BUSE and the data output terminals of which are coupled to external data bus lines D BUSE. The data is set in the address setting registers AR₁ and AR₂ as follows by way of example. Upon start of the execution of a program for the data setting, the data to be written into the register AR₁ is read out from the unshown ROM and is once written into an unshown working register within the execution unit EXEC through a data buffer D BFF as well as the internal data bus lines D BUS. Subsequently, the data of the working register is output to the internal data bus D BUS, and the control signal for writing the data into the register AR₁ is output from the execution unit EXEC. Thus, the data of the data bus line D BUS is written into the register AR₁. Also the register AR₂ has the data written thereinto according to a similar operating sequence. Although no special restriction is intended, the respective contents of the address setting registers AR₁ and AR₂ can be read out through the data bus D BUS. The whole memory space can be divided in three address spaces in accordance with the data set in the two address setting registers AR₁ and AR₂. Although not especially restricted, the address data of the address setting register AR₁ signifies the head address of the second address space among the first to third address spaces, and that of the address setting register AR₂ signifies the head address of the third address space. That is, the data of the register AR₁ makes it possible to identify the boundary between the first address space and the second address space, and that of the register AR₂ makes it possible to identify the boundary between the second address space and the third address space. For example, if the address data items of the address setting registers AR₁ and AR₂ are 400000 and B00000 in hexadecimal numbers respectively, the first address space is set to an address range from 000000 to 3FFFFF , and the second address space is set to an address range from 400000 to AFFFFF . Likewise, the third address space is set to a range from B00000 to FFFFFF . The ranges of the address data supplied from the CPU to the address bus lines A BUS are decided by the comparators COMP₁, COMP₂ and the decision circuit DCD. The comparator COMP₁ compares the address data of the address bus lines A BUS with the data set in the register AR₁. This comparator COMP₁ outputs 1 if the address data of the address bus lines A BUS is greater than that of the register AR₁, and it outputs 0 if not. Likewise, the comparator COMP₂ outputs 1 if the address data of the address bus lines A BUS is greater than that of the register AR₂, and it outputs 0 if not. Thus, the combinations of the outputs of the comparators COMP₁ and COMP₂ are brought into one to one correspondence with the address spaces of the address data of the address bus lines A BUS. The decision circuit DCD is, in effect, constructed of a decoder which decodes the outputs of the comparators COMP₁ and COMP₂. On the basis of the outputs of the comparators COMP₁ and COMP₂, the decision circuit DCD provides three sorts of control signals which indicate the address spaces of the data of the address bus lines A BUS. The output of the decision circuit DCD is used as the operation control signals of selecting circuits SEL₁ and SEL₂ to be described later. In correspondence with the three address spaces or ranges divided by the address data set in the address setting registers AR₁ and AR₂, there are disposed registers hereinbelow, termed configuration registers CR₁ CR₃ each including stages B₀ B₂ in which the data indicating the property of the memory corresponding to the address range is written. Similarly to the address setting registers AR₁ and AR₂, the configuration registers CR₁ to CR₃ have the setting of data therein controlled by the CPU. That is, the data for the configuration registers CR₁ to CR₃ is supplied through the data bus D BUS. In each of these configuration registers CR₁ CR₃, the bit B₀ is used for data which corresponds to the addressing mode of the memory to be externally connected through the external bus lines A BUSE and D BUSE, and the bits B₁ and B₂ are used for data which corresponds to the storage capacity of the memory to be externally connected. Although not especially restricted, the bit B₀ is set at 1 for a memory of the address multiplexing system such as a dynamic RAM, in other words, for a memory to which two kinds of address data items such as a row group address and a column group address are to be supplied in time division, and it is set at 0 for a memory to which two kinds of address data items are to be simultaneously supplied, such as a ROM or a static RAM. The two bits consisting of the bits B₁ and B₂ correspond to four sorts of storage capacities. By way of example, the combinations of the bits B₁ and B₂ 00 , 01 , 10 and 11 correspond respectively to the storage capacities of 16 kilobits, 64 kilobits, 256 kilobits and 1 megabit. Now, by way of example, let s consider a case where the address setting registers AR₁ and AR₂ are respectively set at 400000 and B00000 in hexadecimal numbers and where the bits B₀ of the configuration registers CR₁ CR₃ are respectively set at 0 , 1 and 0 Here, the value 0 of the bit B₀ signifies the address range of the ROM or the static RAM other than the dynamic RAM, and the value 1 of the bit B₀ signifies the address range of the dynamic RAM, as described before. Thus, in a case where the contents of the address setting registers AR₁ and AR₂ and the registers CR₁ to CR₃ are respectively set as stated above, the address range of addresses 000000 to 3FFFFF as illustrated in Fig. 2 becomes the first address space or address region ASP₁ directed to the static RAM or the ROM, the address range of addresses 400000 to AFFFFF becomes the second address space ASP₂ directed to the dynamic RAM, and the address range of addresses B00000 to FFFFFF becomes the third address space ASP₃ directed to the ROM or the static RAM. The information items of the bits B₀ of the respective configuration registers CR₁ CR₃ are passed through the selecting circuit SEL₁ whose switching operation is effected with the decision output signal of the decision circuit DCD, whereby one of the information items is selectively supplied to the control signal generator CSG. More specifically, if the address delivered onto the address bus A BUS lies between 000000 and 3FFFFF , the selecting circuit SEL₁ which is controlled by the output of the decision circuit DCD at that time functions to supply the control signal generator CSG with the content of the bit B₀ of the configuration register CR₁. Meanwhile, if the address on the address bus lies between 400000 and AFFFFF , the content of the bit B₀ of the configuration register CR₂ is supplied to the control signal generator CSG, and if the address on the address bus lines between B00000 and FFFFFF , the content of the configuration register CR₃ is supplied to the same. The decision circuit DCD, the configuration registers CR₁ CR₃ and the selecting circuit SEL₁ constitute address decision means. When the information of the bit B₀ supplied from the selecting circuit SEL₁ is 0 , the control signal generator CSG forms control signals with which address data items A₀ A₂₃ on the address bus A BUS are passed through the address multiplexor MPX as they are, so as to be supplied to the address buffer A BFF, and it delivers the control signals to the address multiplexor MPX. On the other hand, when the information of the bit B₀ supplied thereto is 1 , the control signal generator CSG causes a latch circuit not shown within the address multiplexor MPX to accept the signal of a part corresponding to upper bits or lower bits required for accessing the dynamic RAM, among the address data items delivered from the microprocessor portion CPU onto the address bus A BUS, and it allows the signal of a part corresponding to the lower bits or the upper bits of the address, to pass through the address multiplexor MPX as it is, thereby to deliver this signal as a row address signal. Subsequently, the control signal generator CSG functions to send the upper bits or lower bits of the address already held in the latch circuit within the address multiplexor MPX, from the address multiplexor MPX to the address buffer A BFF and to externally deliver them as a column address signal from the same address terminals as those of the row address signal. Thus, when the address range of the dynamic RAM has been accessed, the upper bits and the lower bits of the address are delivered out individually, namely, by the address multiplexing system. Moreover, in the above case, when the row address signal is output from the address multiplexor MPX, a The dynamic RAM connected to the microprocessor of this embodiment is accessed in synchronism with the falling edges of the The data bus D BUS has the data buffer D BFF connected thereto, the latter serving to input and output data between it and the unshown external memories through external data terminals DT as illustrated in Fig. 1. In contrast, when an address signal outside the address range of the dynamic RAM has been output from the microprocessor portion CPU, the address signal passes through the address multiplexor MPX without any change and is delivered out as it is. Further, the information items of the sets of the bits B₁ and B₂ in the configuration registers CR₁ CR₃ pass through the selecting circuit SEL₂ whose switching state is controlled by the output of the decision circuit DCD, whereby one of the sets is sent to the control signal generator CSG. When the bits B₁ and B₂ of any of the configuration registers CR₁ CR₃ subject to the bit B₀ being set at 1 are set at 0, 0 by way of example, they indicate that the capacity of the corresponding dynamic RAM is 16 kbits, as stated before. In addition, when they are 0, 1 , they indicate the capacity of 64 kbits when they are 1, 0 , they indicate the capacity of 256 kbits and when they are 1, 1 , they indicate the capacity of 1 Mbit. When supplied with the information items of the bits B₁ and B₂ of any of the configuration registers CR₁ CR₃, the control signal generator CSG operates subject to these bits being 0, 0 , to recognize 14 bits for example, A₁ A₁₄ in the signal on the address bus A BUS as the formal address of the dynamic RAM and to latch half A₈ A₁₄ of the bits in the address multiplexor MPX and pass the remaining half A₁ A₇ therethrough without any change. Thereafter, the circuit CSG causes the address multiplexor MPX to deliver the half A₈ A₁₄ to the same external terminals. Subject to the bits B₁ and B₂ being 0, 1 , the control signal generator CSG operates to recognize 16 bits for example, A₁ A₁₆ in the signal on the address bus as the formal address and to latch half A₉ A₁₆ of the bits in the multiplexor MPX and pass the remaining half A₁ A₈ therethrough without any change. Subject to the bits B₁ and B₂ being 1, 0 or 1, 1 , the control signal generator CSG similarly operates to halve the signal of 18 bits or 20 bits and deliver it in two divided steps. In the address signal A₀ A₂₃ delivered from the microprocessor portion CPU, the bits not used for the access to the dynamic RAM are once latched in the address multiplexor MPX and are successively delivered out while the lower bits and upper bits are sequentially output as stated above. An address decoder installed on a memory board, for example, forms a chip select signal on the basis of the delivered bits so as to select the dynamic RAM. Further, in this embodiment, the signal which is supplied from the selecting circuit SEL₁ to the control signal generator CSG and which indicates the information specifying whether or not the address range is of the dynamic RAM is delivered out as a signal Fig. 4 shows a practicable circuit arrangement of the multiplexor MPX. The multiplexor MPX is constructed of latch circuits LT₁ thru LT₂₄ the input terminals of which are coupled to corresponding address lines A₁ thru A₂₀, A₀, and A₂₁ thru A₂₃ constituting the address bus and the data accepting timings of which are controlled by a timing signal Among the inverter circuits IV₁ thru IV₄₇ those IV₁ thru IV₈, IV₁₃ thru IV₂₇, and IV₃₈ thru IV₄₇ are clocked inverter circuits the operations of which are respectively controlled by timing signals Although not especially restricted, each of the clocked inverter circuits is constructed, as shown in Fig. 7, of P channel output MOSFETs Q₃ and Q₄ which are serially connected between a power source terminal V When a control signal supplied to the control line hereinbelow, written as control signal is at a high level, the clocked inverter circuit of the above arrangement is responsively brought into an operating state and supplies the output terminal OUT with an output signal which is inverted in level with respect to an input signal fed to the input terminal IN. When the control signal is at a low level, the clocked inverter circuit is brought into a latch state. That is, the output of the clocked inverter circuit is held at a previous output level irrespective of the level of an input signal by a holding capacitance not shown, e. g., a stray capacitance coupled to the output terminal. Fig. 6 shows a circuit example of the inverter circuit. In Fig. 4, the clocked inverter circuits IV₅ thru IV₈, IV₁₄, IV₁₆, IV₁₈, and IV₂₂ thru IV₂₇ can be regarded as column selection circuits as will be understood from later description. The clocked inverter circuits IV₃₈ thru IV₄₇ in Fig. 4 have their respective input terminals RA₀ thru RA₉ coupled to the output terminals of the refresh counter RC in Fig. 1. The timing signals or control signals Fig. 5 is a circuit diagram of part of the control signal generator CSG. The control signal The timing signal This timing signal Though not shown, a circuit for forming such a timing signal The circuit is constructed of a pulse formation circuit which receives the output of the clock pulse generator CPG in Fig. 1, thereby to form a first clock signal having the aforementioned first cycle and a second clock signal having the aforementioned first and second cycles a first gate circuit made up of an AND circuit which forms the logical product signal among the bit signal B₀ delivered from the selection circuit SEL₁, the first clock signal, and the control signal The timing signal This timing signal By way of example, the timing signal Referring to Fig. 5, a gate circuit G₁₁ made up of an AND circuit has its output brought to the 1 level or high level responsively when the bit signals B₁ and B₂ supplied from the selection circuit SEL₂ in Fig. 1 are 0 and 0 , in other words, when the combination of the bit signals B₁ and B₂ indicates a memory requiring address signals of 14 bits, such as a 16 kilobit memory of 1 bit format. A gate circuit G₁₂ has its output brought to the 1 level responsively when the bit signals B₁ and B₂ are 1 and 0 respectively, in other words, when they indicate a memory requiring address signals of 16 bits, such as a 64 kilobit memory of 1 bit format. Likewise, the outputs of gate circuits G₁₃ and G₁₄ are brought to the 1 level when the bit signals B₁ and B₂ indicate a memory requiring address signals of 18 bits, such as a 256 kilobit memory of 1 bit format, and a memory such as a 1 megabit memory, respectively. A gate circuit G₁ made up of an AND circuit receives the output of the gate circuit G₁₁ and the timing signal A gate circuit G₂ receives the output of an OR gate circuit G₇ supplied with the output of the gate circuit G₁₁ or G₁₂, together with the timing signal Likewise, the timing signal If the bit signals B₁ and B₂ indicate the 256 kilobit or 1 megabit memory, the timing signal The address multiplexor MPX in Fig. 4 is operated in response to the timing signals which are output from the control signal generator CSG in Fig. 5. Fig. 8 shows a timing chart in the case where the 16 kilobit DRAM is accessed. In the case of using the 16 kilobit DRAM, the outputs a₁ thru a₇ of the multiplexor MPX are supplied to the address terminals of such a DRAM through the address buffer A BFF and the external bus lines A BUSE in Fig. 1. Now, the circuit operations will be described by utilizing the timing chart of Fig. 8. The timing signal As illustrated at A in Fig. 8, the timing signal The clocked inverter circuits IV₁ thru IV₄ and IV₁₉ thru IV₂₁ in Fig. 4 are brought into their operating states in response to the timing signal As illustrated at B in Fig. 8, the timing signal The timing signals The clocked inverter circuits IV₅ thru IV₈ in Fig. 4 are brought into their operating states in response to the timing signal Therefore, the respective levels of the outputs a₁ thru a₄ of the multiplexor MPX are determined by the inverter circuits IV₅ thru IV₈. Similarly, the respective levels of the outputs a₅ thru a₇ are determined by the inverter circuits IV₁₄, IV₁₆ and IV₁₈. The inputs of the inverter circuits IV₅ thru IV₈, the input of the inverter circuit IV₁₄, and the inputs of the inverter circuits IV₁₆ and IV₁₈ are respectively coupled to the latch circuits LT₅ thru LT₈, LT₉, and LT₁₀ and LT₁₁. The outputs a₁ thru a₄ and a₅ thru a₇ of the multiplexor MPX are therefore brought to levels corresponding to the address signals A₁₁ thru A₁₄, A₈, A₉ and A₁₀ respectively as illustrated at F in Fig. 8, in response to the timing signals As illustrated at A in Fig. 8, the timing signal Owing to the above operations, the outputs a₁ thru a₇ determined at the time t₀ are set as the row address signals for the 16 kilobit DRAM, and the outputs a₁ thru a₇ determined at the time t₁ are set as the column address signals. The outputs a₁ thru a₇ are maintained at the previous levels by means of holding capacitances such as stray capacitances existent in the respective output lines even when the timing signals The outputs a₀ and a₁₅ thru a₂₃ which need not be address multiplexed have their respective levels determined at the time t₀ as illustrated at G in Fig. 8. That is, the outputs a₀ and a₁₅ thru a₂₃ have their respective levels determined by the static inverter circuits IV₃₄, IV₂₈ thru IV₃₃ and IV₃₅ thru IV₃₇ which receive the outputs of the latch circuits LT₂₁, LT₁₅ thru LT₂₀ and LT₂₂ thru LT₂₄. Though not especially restricted, the outputs a₈ thru a₁₄ are brought to levels corresponding respectively to the address signals A₈ thru A₁₄ at the time t₀. Since these outputs a₈ thru a₁₄ are not supplied to the address input terminals of the 16 kilobit DRAM, they may well be maintained at the levels corresponding to the address signals A₈ thru A₁₆. In case of the arrangement of Fig. 4, to the end of simplifying the circuit arrangement, the address signals A₈ thru A₁₄ are supplied to the outputs a₁ thru a₇ after altering the order thereof properly. For example, the address signal A₈ is not supplied to the output a₁ but is supplied to the output a₅. The address signal A₉ is not supplied to the output a₂ not shown but is supplied to the output a₉. Such alterations, however, merely signify that the correspondence between logic addresses indicated by the address signals A₁ thru A₁₄ and the physical addresses of the DRAM is changed. Fig. 9 shows a timing chart in the case where the 64 kilobit DRAM is accessed. In this case, the timing signals As illustrated at I in Fig. 9, the outputs a₁ thru a₈ of the multiplexor MPX are brought to levels corresponding to the respective address signals A₁ thru A₈ in response to the timing signal As illustrated at J in Fig. 9, the outputs a₀ and a₁₇ thru a₂₃ are brought to levels corresponding respectively to the address signals A₀ and A₁₇ thru A₂₃. Fig. 10 shows a timing chart of the refresh operation. In this case, the timing signals When the refresh control signal Fig. 11 shows a timing chart in the case where the SRAM or ROM which is not of the address multiplexing system is accessed. In this case, the timing signals As illustrated at D in Fig. 11, the outputs a₀ thru a₂₃ of the multiplexor MPX are brought to levels corresponding to the respective address signals A₀ thru A₂₃ in response to the timing signal Fig. 12 is a connection diagram of external memories. Though not especially restricted, each of the external memories DM₁ and DM₂ is constructed of a dynamic RAM of 64 kbits which has address terminals A₀ A₇, a data output terminal DOUT, a column address strobe terminal CAS, a reference potential terminal ground terminal V Referring to the figure, an external address bus A BUSE is coupled to the external address terminals AT in Fig. 1, and an external data bus D BUSE is coupled to the external data terminals DT in Fig. 1. A decoder DEC forms row address strobe signals The address terminals A₀ A₇ of the memories DM₁ and DM₂ are fed with common address signals through the external address bus A BUSE. Thus, the memory DM₁ is selected by the signal The column address strobe terminals The data output terminals DOUT of the memories DM₁ and DM₂ are connected in common to the input terminal of a bus driver TSC, and the data input terminals DIN are connected to the external data bus D BUSE, along with the output terminal of the bus driver TSC. The bus driver TSC is constructed of a tri state circuit which, subject to the low level of a read control signal According to this embodiment, the refresh counter RC is built in the microprocessor as shown in Fig. 1, and when the refresh address of this refresh counter RC is to be provided externally, the signal Besides, the microprocessor of this embodiment includes therein the register for setting the address range of the dynamic RAM, and when any address of the dynamic RAM is to be accessed, the address is automatically multiplexed within the chip. Therefore, even in case of constructing a system in which the static RAM and the dynamic RAM coexist, the dynamic RAM can be accessed as simply as the static RAM without disposing any external circuit. In that case, the read and write controls of the dynamic RAM are executed in accordance with the read control signal Moreover, with this embodiment, the address range of the dynamic RAM can be set at will by setting proper addresses in the address setting registers AR₁ and AR₂. The above embodiment is generally used in such a way that the bits B₀ of the configuration registers CR₁ CR₃ are reset to 0 in a reset state, thereby to first establish a ROM access state and execute a program in the ROM, whereupon the address setting registers AR₁ and AR₂ are previously set in conformity with the system arrangement. It is also possible, however, to alter the set values of the address setting registers AR₁ and AR₂ in the course of the program so as to change the address range of the dynamic RAM. Thus, it becomes possible to construct, for example, a system in which the address area of the ROM and that of the dynamic RAM overlap, the overlap area being used as the ROM area or the RAM area as is necessary. In addition, the respective address spaces which are set by the address setting registers AR₁ and AR₂ may correspond to a plurality of sorts of memories. By way of example, the ROM and the static RAM which have the same addressing system can correspond within a single address space. In this case, a partial address space in the single address space is caused to correspond to the ROM, and another partial address space is caused to correspond to the static RAM. Further, in the embodiment, the configuration registers CR₁ CR₃ are furnished with the bits B₁ and B₂ indicating the capacities of the dynamic RAMs, so that a system can be constructed using the RAMs which have any desired capacities of 16 kbits 1 Mbits. In this regard, those bits of each of the configuration registers CR₁ CR₃ which indicate the capacity of the dynamic RAM are not restricted to the 2 bits B₁ and B₂ as in the embodiment, but they may well be replaced with 1 bit or with 3 or more bits. Likewise, 2 bits may well be used instead of the 1 bit B₀ indicating the information as to whether or not the address range of the dynamic RAM is concerned, thereby making it possible to distinguish the address ranges of the ROM and the static RAM. The configuration registers CR₁ CR₃ may well be furnished with bits which bear information other than the foregoing for example, a bit which indicates whether a corresponding address area is read only or read write, a bit which indicates whether a program or data is concerned, and a bit which indicates whether a system area or a user area is concerned . In the embodiment, the two address setting registers are disposed so as to make it possible to trisect the address space owned by the microprocessor. However, the number of the registers is not restricted to 2, but 1 register or at least 3 registers can also be disposed. While the embodiment has been explained as to the application of this invention to the 16 bit microprocessor, the invention is also applicable to an 8 bit microprocessor. Fig. 13 is a circuit diagram of an address multiplexor MPX and a part of a control signal generator CSG in another embodiment. In this embodiment, timing signals In the control signal generator CSG, an inverter circuit IV₄₅ and an AND gate circuit G₁ constitute a decoder which forms an output signal of high level when bit signals B₁ and B₂ are 1 and 0 respectively, namely, when the bit signals B₁ and B₂ indicates a memory such as 64 kilobit memory of 1 bit format. A timing signal A timing signal Likewise, a timing signal A timing signal Likewise, a timing signal The multiplexor MPX is constructed of clocked inverter circuits IV₀ thru IV₆, IV₂₄ thru IV₃₀, IV₁₄, IV₃₁, IV₁₆, IV₃₂, IV₁₈, and IV₃₃ and static inverter circuits IV₇ thru IV₁₃, IV₁₅, IV₁₇, and IV₁₉ thru IV₂₃, the input terminals of which receive the address signals A₀ thru A₂₃ at the address bus lines A BUS in Fig. 1, and clocked inverter circuits IV₃₄ thru IV₄₃, the input terminals of which receive the respective outputs RA₀ thru RA₉ of the refresh counter RC in Fig. 1. In accordance with this embodiment, in case of using a DRAM which requires 7 bit row address signals and 7 bit column address signals, the address signals A₀ thru A₆ are regarded as the row address signals, and those A₇ thru A₁₃ are regarded as the column address signals. In this case, the outputs a₀ thru a₆ of the multiplexor MPX are supplied to the address terminals of the DRAM. The outputs a₀ thru a₆ are rendered levels corresponding to the address signals A₀ thru A₆ when the timing signal In case of using a DRAM which requires 8 bit row address signals and 8 bit column address signals, the address signals A₀ thru A₆ and A₁₄ are regarded as the row address signals, and those A₇ thru A₁₃ and A₁₅ are regarded as the column address signals. The address signals A₇ thru A₁₃ and A₁₅ are supplied to the outputs a₀ thru a₆ and a₁₄ at the timing of the timing signal In case of using a DRAM which requires 9 bit row address signals and 9 bit column address signals, the address signals A₀ thru A₆, A₁₄ and A₁₆ are regarded as the row address signals, and the address signals A₇ thru A₁₃, A₁₅ and A₁₇ are regarded as the column address signals. The address signals A₀ thru A₆, A₁₅ and A₁₇ are supplied to the outputs a₀ thru a₆, a₁₄ and a₁₆ at the timing of the timing signal In case of using a DRAM which requires 10 bit row address signals and 10 bit column address signals, the address signals A₀ thru A₆, A₁₄, A₁₆ and A₁₈ are regarded as the row address signals, and those A₇ thru A₁₃, A₁₅, A₁₇ and A₁₉ are regarded as the column address signals. The address signals A₇ thru A₁₃, A₁₅, A₁₇ and A₁₉ are supplied to the outputs a₀ thru a₆, a₁₄, a₁₆ and a₁₈ at the timing of the timing signal At the timing of a refresh operation, the timing signals When an SRAM or ROM is to be accessed, the timing signal In case of the multiplexor of the arrangement in Fig. 13, the number of the clocked inverter circuits whose output terminals are connected in common with one another in order to form one output is reduced to 3. According to this invention, the following effects can be attained While, in the above, the invention made by the inventor has been concretely described in conjunction with embodiments, it is needless to say that the present invention is not restricted to the foregoing embodiments but that it can be variously modified within a scope not departing from the purport thereof. For example, in the embodiments, the address range of a dynamic RAM is made variable by a register, but it is also possible to replace the register with means to generate a fixed address and to fixedly divide an address space. Further, the configuration registers CR₁ CR₃ themselves may well be omitted so as to uniquely designate which memory an address range divided by the address setting registers AR₁ and AR₂ belongs to, in accordance with the decision output of the decision circuit DCD and to operate the address multiplexor MPX in correspondence therewith. While, in the above, the invention made by the inventor has been principally described as to the application thereof to a microprocessor in the shape of one chip which forms the background field of utilization, the present invention is not restricted thereto but can be utilized also in case of constructing a multi chip microprocessor.
