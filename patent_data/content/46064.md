# Non silver image forming composition.

## Abstract
A non silver image forming composition comprises a material, preferably a cobalt III complex, capable of generat ing amines on reduction, a photoreductant, an aromatic dialdehyde that reacts with the amines produced by expos ing the composition to activating actinic radiation to give a dye, and a compound capable of providing an NH moiety, if necessary on heating. The latter compound is present at a concentration sufficient to increase the photographic speed of a coating of the composition by at least 0.15 log unit.
