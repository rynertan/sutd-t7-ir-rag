## Description
The present invention relates to reinforcing fibres for use in rotational molding and to a method for producing a fibre reinforced plastic material using said fibres. More particularly the present invention relates to reinforcing fibres and their use to produce a substantially uniform layer of a fibre reinforced plastic material having a substantially uniform distribution of fibres throughout the whole thickness of said layer. Processes for the manufacture of hollow plastic articles by rotational molding are well known as are known processes for reinforcing plastic materials by distributing reinforcing fibres in the plastic matrix thereof. Among the advantages that can be achieved by reinforcing plastic materials with fibres are an increase in dimensional stability, In temperature resistance and in pressure resistance and a reduction in creep rate. Thus, it is known that articles having good mechanical strength and high wall stiffness as well as reduced shrinkage and thereby uniform reproducability of dimensions of produced structures could be achieved by the introduction of reinforcing fibres into the plastic matrix of a produced article. It has also been found, however, that the degree of improvement to a large extent depends on the concentration and distribution of the fibres in the product. A major problem and obstacle to the production by rotational molding of a high quality fibre reinforced plastic material was the inability of the prior art to propose a method of assuring a uniform distribution between the fibres and the layer forming plastic material which would in turn enable the production of relatively thick layers of fibre reinforced plastic material, having even relatively high amounts of fibres distributed substantially uniformly throughout the whole thickness of said layer. The reason for this problem is that when, for example, polyethylene and chopped glass fibres are mixed together and rotomolded, a concentration gladient of fibres is observed in the wall cross section of theproduct. The glass fibres concenteation increases toward the inner surface of the product and at the surface the fibre concentration is so high that in most cases free glass fibres can be poured out from the rotomolded product. Of course, in such moldings the above mentioned improvements will not be achieved. The separation between the glass fibres and the polyethylene powder results from the character of the rotomoldig process,whlch is a two stage process, involving sintering and then densification, in which the resin passes from the powder form into fused form of the product. The sintering commences when the inner surface of the mold reaches the melt temperature of the polymer. Grains that contact the hot mold stick to it. Additional heat which is transferred from the mold to the sintered powder, causes the complete fusion of these grains. The flow properties of the molten grains enable the formation of a continuous, bubble free dense layer. This second stage of the process is called densiflcation . On the first densified layer a new sintered layer is formed.And so layer after layer the wall of the product is constructed. When a mixture of two materials with different melting points is Introduced into the mold, the polymer with the lower melting point will fuse first causing a polymer separation during the rotomolding process. When the two constituents of the mixture are resin powder andchopped fibres, the tendency for separation is much stronger. In recognition of this problem both Brit. Pat 1,381,863 and French Patent 2,163,380 suggest the rotational molding of layered products wherein a first outer layer is formed from fibre free thermoplastic material, a second layer is formed having reinforcing fibres and so on so that the problem of attempting to achieve an even distribution of fibres throughout a relatively thick layer of plastic is avoided. Similarly in U.S. Patent 3,714,312 there is described a method of producing pipes made of fibre reinforced thermoplastic material which Patent, while not relating to rotational molding as herein described, being limited to rotation through only one mode of rotation instead of at least two, nevertheless, specifically teaches that only by limiting each layer to a thickness of less than approximately 2 mm can separation of fibres and resin powder during molding be reduced. In South African Patent Application No. 7515091 there is described and claimed a fibre reinforced plastics material comprising a plastics matrix and substantially randomly oriented Inorganic fibres uniformly dispersed throughout the matrix and a method for the production thereof. Said patent, however completely silent with regard to the above mentioned problem of separation and concentration gradient of fibres and does not provide any solution3 for said observed problem. It is noted, however, that the only example in said patent involved the introduction of only 2.5 per cent by weight of glass fibres and that the patent claims a fibre content in the order of 2 to 5 per cent by weight noting that no improvement was observed when weight per cent was increased from 2.5 to rc . In contradistinction to said prior art patents and the methods described and claimed therein, the present invention provides a method of producing even a relatively thick layer of fibre reinforced plastic material having a substantially uniform distribution of fibres throughout the whole thickness of said layer and also provides specially prepared reinforcing fibres for use in said method. Thus, in one aspect of the present invention there is provided a method for producing a substantially uniform layer of a fibre reinforced plastic material comprising pretreating said fibres by at least partially coating them with the moplastic resin compatible with.having a melting point substantially not higher than said layer forming plastic material and sinterable therewith, to produce discrete reinforcing fibres having the required integrity, length and strength for rotational molding and then subjecting a substantially homogeneous blend of said pretreated fibres and said layer forming plastic material to a rotatioiial molding process whereby there is produced a layer of fibre reinforced plastic material having a substantially tmiforr. distribution of fibres throngliout the whole thickne of said layer. In another aspect of the present invention there are provided reinforcing fibres for use in rotational molding to produce a substantially uniform layer of a fibre reinforced plastic material having a substantially uniform distribution of fibres throughout the whole thickness of said layer, wherein said fibres are pretreated with at least a partial coating of a thermoplastic resin compatible with, having a melting point substantially not higher than that of said layer forming plastic material and sinterable therewith, to produce discrete reinforcing fibres having the required iCntegrity, length and strength for rotational molding. The layer forming plastic material may be any material susceptible to and used or utilizable in a rotational molding process and especially a layer forming thermoplastic resin material selected from the group consisting of polyolefins such as polyethylene, polypropylene and other polyolefinic homo and co polymers, ethyl vinyl acetate copolymers, thermoplastic polyesters, polycarbonatesj polyamides, e.g., nylonl2 and nylon 11, acetal copolymers and combinations thereof are envisioned for use. Such layer forming plastic material may of course also be cross linkable, e.g., crosslinkable polyethylene. Similarly the reinforcing fibres may be any of those susceptible to and used or utilizable as reinforcing fibres in a rotational molding process, especially fibres selected from the group consisting of glass fibres, carbon fibres, organic fibres, asbestos fibres and metal fibres. Preferred are glass fibres and carbon fibres and especially preferred are glass fibres. As will be described hereinafter, the coating resin can be selected from a wide range of resins chosen for their compatability and sinterability with the layer forming plastic material and in many cases the coating resin can be from the same material as the layer forming plastic. Thus, for example, in several preferred embodiments of the present invention there are provided glass fibres especially adapted for use in rotational molding to produce a substantially uniform glass fibre reinforced polyethylene layer comprising glass fibres pretreated with at least a partial coating of a resin compatible and sinterable with polyethylene, e.g., wherein said fibres are at least partially coated with ethyl vinyl acetate copolymer or are at least partially coated with polyethylene. It is to be noted that the incorporation of reinforcing fibres into olefin polymers by pretreating and or preblending has already also been considered by the art. Thus as described in U.S. Patent 3 857 813 In the production of fiber reinforced polyolefin articles, such as glass fibre reinforced articles, it has been the practice in the art to combine the reinforcing fibers with heat plastified polymer in order to intimately mix and coat or encase the fibers in the plastic polymer. The product containing the encapsulated glass fibers or chopped strands substantially uniformly distributed throughout is cooled and ground or cut to granular form suitable for molding. Such a processing is described inBrit.Pat. 1 010 043, however as described therein the resulting product is granular in form and the fibres do not retain the requesite integrity, length and strength recognized by men in the art as necessary for effecting reiniorcement of rotationally molded products. U.S.Patent 3 857 813 which points out the deficiencies of said prior art processing and proposes an alternative dry blending method using very specific components, also obviously does not teach or suggest the pretreatn ent method of the present invention to effect at least a partial coating of the fibres with a thermoplastic resin compatible and sinterable with the layer forming plastic material. The advantages of the present invention can be achieved by several vaiiations within the framework of the general method and approach defined hereinbefore. One approach is to pretreat the fires to create adhesive sites thereon and then to premix said fibres with said resin coating material to effect the adhesion of resin coating particles thereto. Said pretreatment could be by preheating of said fibres to a sufficient temperature so that upon premixing with said coating resin, in powder form, there is effected the sintering and adhesion of said powder on afsd to said hot fibres.Said fiL res could alternatively be pretreated by spraying with a volatile solution of a thermosetting adhesive and then premixing with coating resin whereby upon the hardening of said adhesive snid coating resin adheres thereto and forms at least a partial coating thereon. Another approach is to pretreat said fibres with a hot solution con aining said coating resin, which resin, as stated, could be the same or different than the layer forming plastic material, to form at least a partial coating of said coating resin on said fibres. Thus, e.g., the coatizlb of glass fibres for use in rotational molding with polyetmlcne could be carried out in le following different ways 1. Heating the fibres to a high temperature, e.g.in the range of about 1600 to about 3200 and preferably about 1900 to about 2500C and while hot, mixing them with excess of polyethylene powder. The fine grains of the powder undergo a sintering process on the hot fibres. The partial coating helps the fibre to stick to the hot mold, or to the molten polyethylene layer, thus causing an even distribution of the fibres through the whole thickness of the product 2. . Temporarily wetting said fibres with an agent, such as, non volatile liquid peroxide, to allow a partial temporary coating of powder on the fibres which coating lasts long enough to allow successful rotational molding therewith before said peroxide decompos es in said molding process 3. Applying an intermediate gluing agent.In this kind of treatment the fibres are sprayed with a very dilute and volatile solution of a thermosetting adhesive like epoxy. The wet fibres are immediately blended with excess of polyethylene powder, the volatile solvent evaporates and the resins stick to the epoxy layer and cover the fibre permanently after the epoxy is hardened 4. Coating the fibres with a dilute solution ofEVA Ethyl Vinyl Acetate copolymer. Being compatible with polyethylene the E A coated fibres behave exactly as polyethylene coated fibres and an even distribution of the fibres is achieved and 5. Pretreating continuous fibres with a hot solution containing dissolved polyethylene wherein said polyethylene is preferably dissolved in a solvent selected from the group consisting of toluene,.xylene and ethyl benzene and then chopping said coated fibres to the desired lengths. All of the above mentioned coating processes which can be carried out initially on chopped reinforcing fibres can also be carried out on continuous fibres which are then chopped to the desired length to form reinforcing fibres having the necessary integrity, length and strength for reinforcement in rotational molding. Preferably said fibres are subjected to said rotational molding process in lengths ranging from about 3 to about 12 mm, and a mixture of a major proportion of shorter fibres and a minor proportion of longer fibres within said range is especially preferred. Of the above variations of pretreatment the heating of the fibres as described in 1 hereinbefore and in the examples hereinafter is especially preferred because of the economy and simplicity of said process. While the invention will now be described in connection with certain preferred embodiments in the following examples so titat it may bc more lolly under stood, it will be realised that it is not intended to limit the iivention to tllese particular embodiments. On the contrary, it is intended to cover all alternatives, modifications and equivalents as may be included witla the sce Je of the i.nvention as defined by the appended claims.Thus, the fol owing examples whiob include preferred embodiments will serve to illustrate tll practice of this invention, it t be i ig understood that I.Iit, parbiculars shown are by way of example and for purposes of illustrative discussion of preferred embodiments of the present invention only and are presented in the cause of providing what is believed to the most useful and readily understood description r procedures as well as of the principles and ,con steptual aspects of the invention.Example 1 600 g of 3 mm long. chopped glass fibres were coated to 220 C. 2400 g of 35 mesh polyethylene i wder density 0.937 g cm3, mfi 5 were introduced a alow speed mixer max. 20 r p m and mixed.The hot fibres were introduced into the mixing powder without forming any clusters. After all the fibres were introduced, the mixing was continued for another tl minutes. The mixture was then introduced into a cubic mold L t 30 x 30 x 30 cm dimensions. The mold was rotated in two perpendicular axes. The revolution ratio of the axes axes was Major 3. 75 . The revolution rate Minor 1 or tho major axis was 10 r.p.m. The mold was introduced into an air convected oven 3200C, while rotating for min. The mold was then transferred into the cooling tation where it was first air cooled, followed by water spray cooling. When the mold temperature reached 40 C, it was opened and the product removed. The cube obtained had perfect straight surfaces and its shrinkage tos nearly zero, lich caused some difficulties in removing the product from the mold.The glass fibre distribution was perfect. A fibre concentration a.lysis was carried out or the external and internal aces. The glass fibre concentration of the external surface was 19.5 , and of the internal s nfface 20.5 and the average wall thickness of the cube obtained was about 5.5 mm.Example 2 5 g of 2.5 dimethyl 2.5 di tert butoxy peroxy 3 hexyne were dissolved in 50 cc of methylene cblorid. 600 g of chopped glass fibres, while mixed in a low speed mixer were sprayed with the above solution.The volatile solvent evaporated immc diately, and the fibres which remain slightly wet by the peroxide and traces of solvent, were mixed with 2400 g of 35 mesh crosslinkable PE powdcr, for 4 min. The mixture of glass fibres and PE was introduced into the cubic mold. The mold, while biaxially rotating, was introduced into an air convected oven at 2800C for 45 min.The product obtained had a very low shrinkage, and the glass fibres were perfectly distributed through the whole wall thickness of the product, which was as aboveExample 3 20 g of epoxy resin Araldi 10 g of component A and 10 g of component B were dissolved in 100 cc of methylene chloride to give a first solution. 600 g of 3 mm long, chopped glass fibres were introduced into a low speed mixer 20 r.p.m and sprayed with said solution while mixed. The coated, still wet, fibres were mixed with 2400 g of crosslinkable PE powder in low speed mixer. The glass fibre PE 2400 g of cross linkable PE powder in low speed mixer. The glass fibre PE mixture was introduced into the cubic mold and the same procedure as in Example 2 was repeated.The product obtained had perfect straight surfaces and nearly a zero shrinkage. Its glass fibre distribution was excellent.There were no fibres on the inner surface of this product that were not completely incorporated in the resin. In other words, the fibres of the innermost layer were covered by aPE layer.Example 4 Continuous glass fibres were transferred through a 5 solution of ethyl vinyl acetate copolymer in chloroform theEVA copolymer was a U.S.I. product designated MU 760 . The fibres after being dried were chopped to a length of about 6 mm and 600 g of them were mixed with 2400 g of 35 mesh PE powder density 0.937 g cm mfi 5 g 10 min. . The coating of the cube followed exactly the procedure described inExample l. A very good distribution of the glass fibres, through the whole wall thickness, was achieved. Similar results were obtained when the continuous fibres were coated by a hot 5 PE solution in toluene.Example 5 A 5 solution of EVA copolymer MU 760, U.S.I. in 50 cc of chloroform was sprayed on 600 g chopped glass fibres while mixed in a low speed mixer. The coated fibres were then mixed with 2400 g of MDPE medium density polyethylene, density 0.937, mfi 5 . The mixture was introduced into the cubic mold and followed the procedure described in Example 1 with similar product results. Example 6 A two layer cubic product was cast in which the external layer was a glass reinforced PE and the second layer was normal unreinforced polyethylene. The glass fibre treatment and the casting of the first layer followed the procedure described in Example 1. The mold was charged with 3000 g of the mixture of glass fibres 20 PE and after rotating for 30 min.in thetoven at 3200C, the mold was opened and 1000 g of PE powder density 0.918 g cm3, mfi 5 were introduced. The mold was reclamped and introduced into the oven for another 15 min. The product obtained had improved impact strength when impacted by a falling dart on the external surface. Example 7 400 g of preheated chopped glass fibres were premixed with 1600 9 of cross linkable polyethylene. The mixture was Introduced into a spherical mold with a diameter of 25 cm. The mold, while biaxially rotating, was introduced into an oven at 2800C for 55 min. The product obtained had a wall thickness of 15 mm and the glass fibres were perfectly distributed through the whole wall thickness.Example 8 Chopped glass fibres were treated as in Example 1.A mixture of 2 kg. treated glass fibres and 8 kg. of 35 meshPE powder were introduced into an aluminum mold of an elongated ovoid shape. The mold was equipped with a device which enabled the introduction of gas into the mold while biaxially rotating. The mold was hermetically closed so that it could keep a pressure of at least 20 psi. The charged mold while rotating was introduced into an air convected oven at 3600C for 22 min. The mold was then removed from the oven into a cooling chamber and air cooled for 3 min., then gas was introduced into the mold to generate an internal pressure in the mold of 14 psi. This pressure was maintained through the whole cooling cycle. Due to that pressure, two things were achieved 1. It caused the fibres of the inner layer to lie and be better incorporated in the molten resin.2. The inner pressure reduced the shrinkage of the product daring the cooling cycle, thus, reducing deformations formed in the product. Table 1 indicates the difference in the percent of shrinkage between the reinforced product prepared as described and an unreinforced product molded under the exact same conditions.

As will be realised, the significant reduction in shrinkage achieved when using a method of the present invention constitutes a major advance in the art since it indicates that structures can be mass reproduced with substantial uniform reproducability of dimensions of the produced structures. Purthermore, as will be realized from the above examples and description, in accordance with the method of the present invention, it is possible in a single molding operation to produce a uniform layer of a fibre reinforced plastic material having a thickness of aEMI15.1 anywhere from 2 to 30 mm and a fibre content of as much as 30 which layer is still characterized by having a substantially uniform distribution of fibres throughout the whole thickness of said layer. Of course, such a layer could be combined with one or more cther layers of unreinforced plastic material for esthetic or other commercial reasons, however, such a combination does not detract from the fact that the present invention enables the production of a substantially uniform layer of fibre reinforced plastic matrix3 as descibed. It will be evident to those skilled in the art that tile invention is not limited to the details of the foregoing illustrative embodiments and examples and that the present invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the essential attributes thereof, and it is, therefore, desired that the present examples be considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive, reference being made to the appended claims, rather than to the foregoing description, and all charges which come with the meaning and range of esuivalency of the claims are, therefore, intended to be embraced therein.
