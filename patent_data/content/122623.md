# Antistatic fiber and its production.

## Abstract
An antistatic fiber obtained by melt spinning of a fiber forming thermoplastic polymer containing at least one of polyoxyalkylene glycol and its derivatives in an amount of not less than 0.5 by weight, characterized in that said fiber has a half life time of electric charge leakage of not more than 150 seconds before and after treatment with a weight decreasing agent and, when treated with a weight decreasing agent, provides a number of streaks arranged in parallel in the lengthwise direction at the surface.
