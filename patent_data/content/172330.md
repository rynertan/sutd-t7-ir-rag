# Photocurable composition.

## Abstract
Disclosed are photocurable compositions which com prise A a compound having at least one epoxy group and at least one photocurable unsaturated ethylenic double bond within the same molecule B an organometallic compound and C a silicon compound capable of generating silanol group by irradiation of light, or comprise A a compound having at least one epoxy group and at least one photocurable unsaturated ethylenic double bond within the same molecule E an epoxy compound F an organic phosphorus compound and G a photosensitizer. The compositions of the present invention have excel lent film characteristics such as good adhesion property, light resistance, heat resistance and weathering resistance.
