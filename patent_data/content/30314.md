Azo dyes are known having shades varying from reddish blue to greenish blue and structures similar to the one of the dyes of the present invention, which however have the drawback of being little stable to the pH variations during the dyeing, or of undergoing a degradation during said dyeing, or even of exhibiting low values of fastness to light such dyes are described for example in the following patents German patents 659,147 and 658,124, n which 6 chloro or 6 bromo 2.4 dinitroaniline are diazotized and copu lated respectively on EMI6.1 U.S. patent 2,434,150 in which 2 alkylsulphonil 4 nitro anilines are diazotized and copulated on EMI6.2 German patent 639,727 in which 2 amino benzotliiazoles are diazotized and copulated on EMI7.1 alkylene OHThe Applicant has now surprisingly found that it is possible to obtain blue dyes corresponding to general formula I which exhibit, in respect of the known ones, improved general stabilities and in particular to light and sublimation. Furthermore they exhibit a remarkable improvement of the dyeing properties, and in particular a high stability to the pH variations of the dyeing bath practical ly no substantial differences of shade can be observed among the dyeings effected at pH values ranging from 4 to 7. Generally the dyes of general formula I are obtained at a high purity degree, wherefore they do not require any purification. The monoazo dyes of the present invention are particularly suited to dye and print synthetic polymeric materials such as, for example, polyesters, polyamides, polyacrylonitrile and the esters of cellulose in any form. When applicated according to the usual dyeing methods, for example by means of an aqueous bath under pre sure at 1300C, or by padding and steaming or by padding and heating with dry air Thermosol , or according to the printing methods, they impart to these materials bright and intense dyeings and printings varying from reddish blue to greenish blue, and exhibit a good affinity for, as well as a good stability to light, washing and sublimitation. Due to the excellent stability to the pH variations of the dyeing bath, the monoazo dyes of general formula I are particularly suited to dye polyester at high temperature. Similar applicative results and indentical possibilities of obtaining dyeings and printings varying from reddish blue to greenish blue are achieved by using mixtures of dyeings of general formula I either with one another, or with those described in Italian patent application No. 30,691 A 78 and having general formula EMI8.1 These mixtures are prepared according to various methods, for example during the preparation or finishing steps. In the class of the monoazo dyes of general formula I , the terms in which substituent R is an alkyl C4 C8 or an alkenyl C3 C6 are particularly interesting due to the higher affinity for the already mentioned man made fibres. For the applications mentioned hereinbefore the dyes, either individually or in admixture, in the dry state or in mass, are ground in the presence of proper dispersants such as, for instance, sodium ligninsulphon ate, till obtaining particles of 0.5 1 , and are applicated onto the fibres according to the above cited techniques.
