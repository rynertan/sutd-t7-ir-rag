# Apparatus for controlling the profile of a tunnel or gallery cut by a cutting head, and tunnel cutting machine equipped with such apparatus.

## Abstract
An apparatus for controlling the profile of an aperture cut by a cutting head capable of traversing movement in two directions at right angles to each other, e.g. the cutt ing head c of a mining machine, wherein means is pro vided to control the movement of the cutting head c in said two directions and including a template 21 for an in ternal profile 23 representing that part of the aperture to be cut, a sensing device 35 engageable with the template profile 23 , follower means 3, 11 associated with the cutting head c to cause relative movement between the sensing device 35 and template 21 in a direction related to movement of the cutting tool c , movement of the sen sing device 35 into engagement with the profile 23 ope rating hydraulic sensing equipment which automa tically overrides the means L, A to controll the movement of the cutting head c , thereby preventing the cutting head c from moving beyond the desired tunnel profile. The hy draulic sensing equipment preferably comprises a series of control valves 41, 43, 45, 47 associated with re spective quadrants of the profile which are connected to gether in such a manner as to reverse the direction of movement of the cutting head c as necessary.
