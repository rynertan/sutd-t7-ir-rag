# Diffusion apparatus.

## Abstract
A diffuser has an upstream duct 11, a downstream duct 12, the adjacent ends 11A, 12A of the ducts defining a sudden enlargement of flow area. A fence 13 arranged downstream of the downstream end 11A of the upstream duct 11 defines the upstream end 12A of the downstream duct 12 and has a free edge 13A defining a flow area intermediate between that of defined by the adjacent ends 11A, 12A of the two ducts 11, 12. A chamber 14 at the outside of the upstream duct 11 has an opening 15 defined by the downstream end 11A of the upstream duct 11 and the free edge 13A of the fence. The ratio between the flow areas of the two ducts 11, 12 at their adjacent ends lies between 1.4 and a minimum greater than 1. The above ratio provides high diffuser effectiveness with little or no bleed from the chamber 14. Elements each comprising a diffuser as above may be arranged in flow series to make possible a pressure rise grea ter than that given by a single element. A downstream one of the elements may have an area ratio greater than that of the preceding element s and its chamber 14 may be connected by a bleed line 18 to the upstream duct of one of the preceding elements, thereby to reduce the static pressure in the chamber and provide in respect of that downstream element, both a high area ratio and high effectiveness.
