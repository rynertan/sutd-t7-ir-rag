# RUBBER SHEETING WITH INTEGRAL ADHESIVE EDGE

## Abstract
Fully cured thermoset ethylene propylene rubber sheets having integral thermoplastic adhesive strips molded along the lateral edges are produced using a manufacturing method where the strips are applied prior to vulcanization of the rubber sheeting. The factory applied adhesive strip is non tacky and dry but is activated by heat to securely bond the ethylene propylene rubber sheets together in an overlap splicing procedure. A method of using the integral adhesive rubber sheeting for single ply rubber roofing membrane or pond liners is also disclosed. Instantaneous attainment of maximum seam strength, water tightness and consistency of the seams are advantages over conventional solvent based adhesive methods.
