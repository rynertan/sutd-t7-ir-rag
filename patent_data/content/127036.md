# Method and apparatus for detecting and counteracting a deformation of the stock discharge gap in a headbox of a paper machine.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method and an apparatus for detecting and counteracting a deformation of the stock dis charge gap 6 in a paper machine headbox, which is caused by thermal expansion due to the temperature of the stock and or the pressure of the stock. This is achieved by ultrasonic transducers 7 9, 10 20 22 located close to the slice opening 6 which obtain measurement results relating to the distance between the roof member 1 and the apron beam member 2 of the headbox. At least two such transducers, one 20 pref erably located close to a side wall 23 of the discharge gap 6 and the other 21 preferably located midway between the side walls 23, 24 , give information about a possible differ ence between the measurement results caused by the defor mation. This difference serves as a guide for adjusting the temperature of the apron beam member 2 and or the roof member 1 , in such a way that the deformation is reduced in magnitude or entirely eliminated.
