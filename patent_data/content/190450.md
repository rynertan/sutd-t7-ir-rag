## Description
The present invention relates to a device for measuring the profile of aspectacle lens frame according to the precharacterizing part of claim 1.More particularly, the invention is concerned with a spectacle lens framemeasuring device suitable for use in combination with a lens grinding oredging machine which is adapted to grind or edge an unmachined or uncutspectacle lens in accordance with information concerning the profile of thelens frame. A spectacle lens frame measuring device is shown in US A 4,051,601. Thisknown device includes frame holding means for holding a spectacle lensframe, support means for supporting the frame means, this support meansbeing capable of moving the spectacle lens frame towards a measuringmeans, and within a plane which is perpendicular to a vertical shaft wherethe support means is perpendicular to the shaft, the measuring meansincluding a sensor arm rotatable about a vertical axis and a sensor feelermovably mounted on the arm in a direction parallel with the vertical shaft. The rotation of the feeler on its support about the axis and the displacementof the spectacle frame will be produced by the system. US A 3,786,600 discloses a counter grinder which has its axis positionedalong the secondary radius the distance from the line passing through thecenter of the grinding wheel to the axis of the glass lens holder by adistance equal to the length of the principal radius the distance from theline passing through the center of the shaft to the geormetric axis of theeyewire lens opening. In this known counter grinder the spectacle lensframe is secured by a clamping mechanism in the direction perpendicular to an axis of the glass lens so that if the spectacle lens frame is stronglysecured. EP A 1 0 092 364 relates to a decive for measuring a lens to fit a spectacleframe in which the profile of the spectacle lens frame is measured interms of polar coordinate information. This document is silent as to how tohold the spectacle lens frame and how to construct the tip of a probe. In the prior art, for measuring the profile of the lens frame, the spectaclelens frame supported on the supporting means had to be translationallymoved in order to apply the feeler against the groove of the frame androtate the frame about the contact point of the feeler. Therefore, the priorart device has disadvantages that the supporting means not only had to becomplicated in its construction but also became large and that, furthermore,it was troublesome to hold the frame on the supporting means because jawsor clamps are employed as the holding means. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a device formeasuring the profile of a spectacle lens frame, in order to overcome thedisadvantages of the prior art above mentioned. Another object of the present invention is to provide a spectacle framemeasuring device being capable of measuring the profile of the frame interms of polar coordinate information. According to the present invention, the above object can be accomplishedby a device according to the characterizing part of claim 1. Further advantageous developments of the device according to the inventionare mentioned in claims 2 and 3. The above object and advantages of the present invention will becomeapparent from the following description of preferred embodiments withreference to the accompanying drawings. An embodiment of the invention will be explained hereinunder with referenceto the accompanying drawings. Fig. 1 is a perspective view of lens frame profile measuring device in accordance with the invention. The deviceof the invention is composed of three major parts namely, a frame holdingmeans 100 for a spectacle lens frame a supporting means 200 for supportingthe frame holding means 100 and adapted for causing movement of said holding means into and out of the measuring plane and ameasuring section 300 for digitally measuring the profile of the spectacle lens frame or a template of thespectacle lens frame. The supporting means 200 has a pair of parallel rails 202a, 202b arranged on the housing 201 such as toextend in the longitudinal direction X axis direction of the measuring coordinate system and a movablestage 203 slidably carried by these rails 202a, 202b. A female screw thread 204 is formed in the lower side ofthe movable stage 203. An X axis feeding screw 205 is screwed into the female thread portion 204. The X axisfeeding screw 205 is driven by an X axis motor 206 which is a pulse motor. A guide shaft 208 parallel to the Y axis of the measuring coordinate system is extended between theside flanges 207a and 207b of the moving stage 203. The guide shaft 208 is adapted to be rotatively drivenby a guide shaft motor 209 secured to a flange 207a. The guide shaft 208 is provided in the outer surfacethereof with a guide groove 210 which extends in parallel with the axis of this guide shaft 208. The guideshaft 208 slidably carries supporters 211 and 212. The supporter 211, 212 have axialbores 213, 214 whichare provided with projections 213a, 214a slidably engaging with the guide groove 210 in the guide shaft208, thus preventing the supports 211, 212 from rotating about the guide shaft 208. The supporter 211 has two slant surfaces 215, 216 which intersect each other. Similarly, the supporter212 has two slant surfaces 217, 218 which intersect each other. The ridge line 220 formed by two slantsurfaces 215, 216 and the ridge line 219 formed by two slant surfaces 215, 216 are parallel to each other andare disposed in the same plane. In addition, the angle formed between the two slant surfaces 217, 218 andthe angle formed between the two slant surfaces 215, 216 are equal to each other. As shown in Figure 5 b ,a spring 230 is stretched between the two supporters 211 and 212. A pulley 222 is rotatably supported by one end of the rear flange 221 on the movable stage 203, whilethe other end of the flange 221 carries a Y axis motor 224 having a pulley 223. A miniature belt 226 tensedby a spring 225 goes round both pulleys 223, 224. The ends of the miniature belt 226 are connected to a pin227 provided on the supporter 211. A flange 228 is formed on the upper surface of the supporter 212. Theflange 228 is constructed so as to be moved into and out of contact with the side surface of the pin 229provided on the rear flange 221 of the movable stage 203. The measuring section 300 includes a sensor arm driving motor 301 secured to the lower side of thehousing 201, and a sensor arm arrangement 302 secured to the upper side of the housing 201. A belt 305goes round a pulley 303 on the shaft of the motor 301 and the rotary shaft 304 of the sensor arm portion, sothat the torque of the motor 301 is transmitted to the sensor arm. The sensor arm arrangement 302 has apair of rails 311, 311 extended above the base 310, and a sensor head 312 is slidably carried by the rails 311,311. A magnetic scale reading head 313 is attached to one side surface of the sensor head 312 so as to beable to read the magnetic scale 314 which is extended in parallel with the rails 311, thereby detecting thedisplacement of the sensor head 312. The head 312 is always urged towards the arm by means of a spiralspring 316 of a spring device 315 connected to the other side of the sensor head 312. Figure 4 shows the construction of the spring device 315. A solenoid 318 is provided in a casing 317which is secured to the base 310 of the sensor arm arrangement 302, and a slide shaft 319 is axially slidablyreceived in an axial bore formed in the magnet 318. The slide shaft 319 has flanges 320, 321 and a spring323 acts between the flange 320 and the well of the casing 317 so as to normally urge the slide shaft 319 tothe left as viewed in Figure 4. Clutch disks 324, 325 are rotatably supported at one end of the slide shaft 319.A spiral spring 316 is connected to the clutch disk 324 at its one end. A spring 326 wound round the slideshaft 319 acts between the two clutch disks 324 and 325 so as to urge these disks away from each other,thereby preventing the clutch disk 325 from contacting the spiral spring 316. A washer 327 is secured to theend of the slide shaft 319. Figure 6 shows the construction of the sensor head 312. The sensor head 312 has a slider 350 which issupported by the rails 311. The slider 350 has a vertical axial bore 351 which receives a sensor shaft 352. Aball bearing 353 held by the sensor shaft 352 rotatably contacts the wall of the axial bore 351 so as to enablethe sensor shaft 352 to smoothly rotate about the vertical axis and to move also in the axial direction. Anotch having a semi circular cross section is formed in an upper portion of the sensor shaft 352. Thenotched surface 354 constitutes a template feeler which, when the profile of a template formed by profilingmachining through profiling a spectacle lens frame, contacts a side surface of the template. An arm 355attached to the center of the sensor shaft 352 rotatably carries a groove feeler 356 having a diamond shapedcross section and adapted to engage with the lens groove in the lens frame. The arrangement issuch that notched surface, i.e., the template contact surface 354, and the peripheral apex of the groovefeeler 356 are positioned on the central axis of the sensor shaft 352. Beneath the slider 350 is provided a reading head 359 for measuring the amount of vertical shaft,namely, the Z axis directional shift, of the sensor shaft 352, and a magnetic scale 360 of a sensor 358 isprovided on the lower end of the sensor shaft 352. The construction of the frame holding means 100 will be explained with reference to Figures 2A and 3.Frame holder bars 152, 152 are fastened to the centers of the flanges 151, 151 of a stationary base 150. Theflanges 151, 151 have side edges 151a, 151a. A movable base 153 having side edges 153a, 153a is receivedbetween the bottom panel 150a and the flanges 151 of the stationary base 150. The movable base 153 issupported by a pair of leaf springs 154, 154 which are situated on the bottom panel 150a of the stationarybase 150. The movable base 153 is provided with a pair of parallel guide grooves 155, 155 formed therein. Sliders156, 156 are carried by the movable base 153 with their legs 156a, 156a slidably engaging the guidegrooves 155, 155. On the other supporters, a circular opening 157 is formed in the center of the movablebase 153. A spring 158 rotatably fits on the inner periphery of the circular opening 157. A pair of pins 159,159 are received in slots 156c, 156c formed in stepped portions 156b, 156b of the sliders 156, 156. Verticalnotches 156d, 156d are formed in the central portions of the sliders 156, 156 so as to be able to receive theframe holding bars 152, 152 mentioned before. Finger retaining holes 156e, 156e for receiving theoperator s fingers are formed in the upper surfaces of the sliders 156, 156 so as to facilitate themanipulation of the sliders by the operator. The operation of the frame profile measuring device heretofore explained will be describedhereinunder with specific reference to Figures 2 B , 2 C and 5 A , 5 B . Referring first to Figure 2 B , the operator inserts his fingers into the holes 156c, 156c of the sliders 156,156 so as to move the sliders 156, 156 sufficiently apart from each other and to press the same downwardlytogether with the movable base 153 against the resilient force of the rear springs 154, 154, thereby leaving alarge gap between the holding bars 152, 152 and the stepped portions 156b, 156b of the sliders 156, 156.Then, one of the spectacle lens frames 501 which is to be measured is placed in this gap, and then thesliders 156, 156 are moved towards each other such that the upper and lower rims of the lens frame 501contact the inner surfaces of the sliders 156, 156. In this embodiment since the sliders 156 and 156 areconnected to each other through a ring 158, the displacement of one of the sliders causes the samedisplacement of the other. Then, the frame is slid such that substantially the mid point of the upper rim comes under the holdingbar 152. As the operator releases the sliders 156, 156, the movable base 153 is lifted by the resilient force ofthe leaf springs 154, 154, so that the lens frame 500 is clamped between the stepped portions 156b, 156band the holding bars 152, 152, and the frame 500 is held under such a condition that the geometrical centerof the lens frame 501 substantially coincides with the center 157a of the circular opening 157. In this state,the distance d between the apex 501a of the lens groove in the lens frame 501 and the side edge 151a of theflange 151 equals the distance d between the apex 501a and the edge 153a of the movable base 153. Then, the frame holding means 100 thus holding the frame 500 is placed in the gap between thesupporters 211, 212 which have in advance been adjusted to define a gap of predetermined sizetherebetween. Then, the Y axis motor 224 operates through a predetermined angle so that the miniaturebelt 226 is driven to shift the supporter 211 leftward by a predetermined amount. In consequence, the frameholding mean 100 and the supporter 212 are moved to the left so that the flange 228 comes off the pin 229.Simultaneously, the frame holding means 1,00 is clamped between the supporters 211,212 which are urgedtowards each other by the tension spring 230. In this stage, the edges 151a, 152a of the flange. 151 of thestationary base 150 of the frame holding means 100 are contacted by the slant surfaces 215, 217 of thesupporters 211, 212, respectively,, while the edges 153a, 153b of the movable base 153 are contacted by theslant surfaces 216, 218 of the supporters 211, 212. In the described embodiment, the distance between the apex 501a of the lens groove of the lens frameand the edge 151a is equal to that between the apex 501a and the edge 153a as explained before, so that theframe holding means 100 clamped between the supporters 211 and 212 is automatically, located such thatthe apex 501a of the lens groove in the lens frame 501 is positioned in a reference plane S which is definedby the ridge lines 219, 220 of the two supporters. Then, the guide shaft motor 209 operates through a predetermined angle so that the frame holdingmeans 100 is rotated to a position shown by the two dot and dash line in Figure 5 A , whereby thereference plane S is stopped at the same plane as the initial position of the lens groove feeler 356 of themeasuring means 300. The Y axis motor 224 further operates to move the supporters 211, 212 supporting the frame holdingmeans 100 in the Y axis direction by a predetermined amount so as to bring the center 159a of the circularopening of the frame holding means substantially into alignment with the axis of the rotary shaft 304 of themeasuring means 300. In the course of this movement, the lens groove feeler 356 contacts the lens groovein the lens frame 501. The initial position of the lens groove feeler 356 is limited due to the fact that a pin352a provided on the lower end of the sensor shaft 352 contacts a hanger 310a attached to the base 410 ofthe sensor arm, as will be seen from Figures 5 A and 5 B . This arrangement ensures that the feeler 356comes into the lens groove without fail, when the spectacle frame 500 is moved by the operation of the Y axismotor 224. Subsequently, the motor 301 operates in a stepping manner by an angle corresponding to apredetermined number of pulses each time. In this case, the sensor head 312 moves on the rails 311,311 inaccordance with the profile of the spectacles frame 500, i.e., in accordance with the radius of the lens frame501. Meanwhile, the displacement, i.e., the amount of movement, mf the sensor head 312 is read by meansof the reading head against the magnetic scale 314. Thus, the profile of the lens frame is measured as a function ρn, n n 1,2,3... N of the rotation angle of the motor 301 and the reading from the reading head 313. As stated before, the first measurement is conducted while the axis 0 of the rotary shaft 304substantially coincides with the geometrical center of the lens frame 501 as shown in Figure 7. The secondmeasurement is conducted as follows. The polar coordinate value ρn, n obtained in the first measurement are converted into rectangular coordinate data Xn, Yn . From the rectangular coordinatedata Xn, Yn , there are selected a point B Xb, Yb having the maximum X axis value, point D xd, yd having the minimum X axis value, point A xa, ya having the maximum Y axis value, and the point C xc,yc having the minimum Y axis value. Using the data concerning these positions, the geometric center 0o of the lens frame is determined inaccordance with the following formula 1 . Then, the X axis motor 206 and he Y axis motor 224 are operated in accordance with the values xo andyo so as to move the frame holding means 100 clamped between the supporters 211, 212, thereby bringingthe geometrical center Oo of the lens frame 501 into alignment with the axis O of rotation of the sensor arm302. The second measurement of the lens frame profile is conducted in this state, so as to determine thevalues oρn, o n n 1 2 3 ... N . When the second measurement is carried out, the amount of shift of thesensor head 312 is measured by the sensor 358. Consequently, three dimensional data oρn, o n, Zn N 1 2 3 ...N of the profile of the frame are obtained in accordance with the second measurement. If the lens groove feeler 356 accidentally comes off fromthe lens frame 501 during the measurement of the lens frame501, the measured data with largely deviate from the datameasured in the preceding measuring cycle, as indicated by e in Fig. 7. Therefore, when the measured data has gone beyonda predetermined radius changeable range a , the rotation ofthe sensor arm 302 is stopped and, at the same time, thesolenoid 318 of the spring device shown in Fig. 4 is energizedso as to attract the flange 321. In consequence, the clutchdisks 324, 325 clamp the spiral spring 316 so as to stop thewinding action of the spring 316, thereby avoiding anyaccident such as damaging of the spectacle frame which mayotherwise be caused by interference between the arm 355 of thesensor head 312 and the lens frame. In the event ofaccidental disengagement of the feeler 356, the spectacleframe 500 is reset to the initial measuring position, and themeasurement is commenced again in this state. Fig. 8 is a block diagram of a computing and controllingcircuit which is incorporated in the frame profile measuringdevice of the invention. The circuit has driver circuits 601through 604 which are connected, respectively, to the X axismotor 206, Y axis motor 224, sensor arm driving motor 301 andthe guide shaft driving motor 209. These driver circuitsdrive respective pulse motors in accordance with the numbersof pulses delivered by a pulse generator 609, under thecontrol of a sequence control circuit 610. The reading outputof the reading head 313 is counted by a counter 605 the outputof which is delivered to a comparator circuit 606. Thecomparator circuit 606 compares the amount of change in thecounted value derived from the counter 605 with a referencesignal corresponding to the aforementioned radius changeablerange a derived from a reference value generating circuit607. When the counted value is within the range a ,the number n counted by the counter 605 and the sensor arm rotation angle ncalculated from the number of pulses delivered by the pulse generator 609 are input as polar coordinatevalues ρn, n to a data memory 611. Then, the sequence control circuit 610 switches a gate circuit 612 soas to connect it to the computer circuit 613 which in turn computes the data concerning the position of thegeometrical center Oo of the lens frame 501. The computed data is input to the sequence control circuit 610.Upon receipt of this data from the computing circuit 613, the sequence control circuit 610 determines thecoordinate values Xo, Yo in accordance with the formula 1 mentioned earlier, and inputs necessarynumbers of pulses to the drivers 601, 603 so as to drive the motors 206, 224, thereby bringing the center ofthe lens frame 500 into alignment with the axis of rotation of the sensor arm 302. At the same time, thesequence control circuit 610 commands a counter 615 to count the output of the sensor 358. Then, theprofile data oρn, o n, Zn is measured again and is stored in the data memory 611. If the count value opnor o n derived from the counter 605 exceeds the radius changeable range a derived from the referencevalue generating circuit 607, the comparator informs the sequence control circuit of this fact, and the circuit610 activates the driver 608 so as to energize the solenoid 318 of the spring device 315, thereby stoppingthe movement of the feeler 356, while terminating the supply of pulses to the driver 604 so as to preventthe motor 301 from operating. The profile data oρn, o n, Zn stored in the datamemory 611 is supplied, through switching of the gate circuit612 as required, to a suitable device such as a digital lensgrinding machine, shaping machine or a judging device forjudging whether the frame has been machined in conformity withthe design data, which machines and device having beenproposed by the same applicant in earlier Japanese PatentApplication No. 225197 1983. The computing circuit 613 cancalculate a curve value M of the lens groove of the frame 500from the data Zn stored in the data memory 611. Referring nowto Figures 9 A and B , the radius of curvature R of thesphere SP including the locus of the lens groove of the frame501 is calculated from the data ρn, n, Zn for at leasttwo points a and b as and the curve value M can then be computed as The sequence control circuit executed the above explainedmeasuring steps in accordance with the program stored in aprogram memory 614.
