# Polyamide acid composition for preparing polyimide and process for preparing polyimide from the same.

## Abstract
A polyamide acid composition for preparing a polyimide which can extend the pot life of the composition comprising a solution of a polyamide acid in an organic solvent, the polyamide acid being a precursor of the polyimide, a dehydrating agent, a catalyst and a pot life extending agent which can lower a rate of conversion of the polyamide acid to the plyimide, and the process for preparing the polyimide from said polyamide acid composition. According to the present invention the pot life can be extremely extended to give the composition an enough flowability for a long time without reducing the excellent properties such as a heat resistance and an electric insulation of the obtained polyimide.
