## Description
In order to be effective in cleaning the teeth, dentifrices must contain a polishing agent or an abrasive ingredient such as calcium carbonate, dicalcium phosphate, tricalcium phosphate, calcium pyrophosphate, sodium metaphosphate, hydrated silica and the like. Some stains, particularly coffee and tea stains, tenaciously adhere to the tooth surfaces and are, therefore, much more difficult to remove. While a more abrasive polishing agent can be used, these generally result in damage to the oral hard tissues after prolonged use of the dentifrice. It has now been found that a dentifrice containing an appropriate amount of a particular abrasive system, namely a combination of anhydrous aluminum silicate and diatomaceous earth silica , can be used to provide a high polishing, high cleaning dentifrice which is not overly abrasive radioactive dentin abrasion index in the 130 150 range . Other abrasive agents can also be present, if desired. Dentifrices containing diatomaceous silica are known. Thus, U.S. Patent 2,820,000 describes a dentifrice containing primarily diatomaceous earth silica . However, this abrasive alone does not provide a high polishing and high cleaning formulation which is not overly abrasive. U.K. Patent 1 522 119 discloses that the use of diatomaceous silica as an abrasive in combination with one or more other abrasive components which may include synthetic silica, alkaline earth metal carbonates, or an aluminum silicate. This, however, teaches away from the use of more than 5 diatomaceous silica, stating that such concentrations make the dentifrice excessively abrasive, hence causing damage to the teeth. U.S. Patents 3,906,090 and 4,254,579 teach dentifrices containing interbonded silicates and alumina, for example sodium aluminosilicate complex, as abrasives. These interbonded silicates and alumina are chemically different from the anhydrous aluminum silicate and diatomaceous earth silica of the present invention and none of the silicates or alumina, being mildly abrasive, are very effective cleaning agents. The combination of the anhydrous aluminum silicate with diatomaceous earth silica provides a high polishing and cleansing dentifrice with superior cleaning capabilities to that provided by using either of these polishing agents alone. The combination also provides superior cleaning efficacy compared to the leading commercial family toothpaste which contains a milder abrasive system but the combination is not so abrasive so as to damage the oral tissues. The combination also provides superior cleaning efficacy compared to a commercial dentifrice which is specifically promoted for removal of tobacco stains. It is accordingly the object of this invention to provide a new dentifrice which has high polishing and cleaning properties suitable for removal of tenacious stains on teeth, such as coffee and tea stains, yet not be too abrasive so as to damage the oral tissues with daily use. This and other objects of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description. This invention relates to a toothpaste having high polishing and cleaning properties suitable for the removal of coffee and tea stains without being too abrasive. More particularly, the toothpaste comprises an abrasive system in a non toxic paste according to claim 1, the abrasive system comprising a combination of anhydrous aluminum silicate and diatomaceous earth silica in a ratio of 0.5 1 1.5 1, the toothpaste having a radioactive dentin abrasion index which does not exceed 150. A toothpaste having high polishing and cleaning properties suitable for the removal of tenacious coffee and tea stains contains an abrasive system in a non toxic paste. The abrasive system contains, as an essential ingredient, a combination of anhydrous aluminum silicate and diatomaceous earth silica . The anhydrous aluminum silicate should optimally have an average particle size of less than 1 micron µm to provide high polishing properties without undue abrasivity however, slightly larger average particle sizes up to 15 microns would be suitable for this application. The whiteness of the anhydrous aluminum silicate selected for use may be an important attribute as well since commercially available U.S.P. Kaolin anhydrous aluminium silicate has an off white tint which may impart unwanted color or shading to finished product. The diatomaceous earth silica should optimally have a median particle size of 5.5 microns with about 25 or less of the particles having particle sizes greater than 8 microns. Both of these essential ingredients are commercially available. For example, the anhydrous aluminum silicate is available under the trademark Kaopolite SF and the diatomaceous earth silica is available under the trademark Superfloss. The anhydrous aluminum silicate generally is 5 15 of the dentifrice, preferably 8 12 and the diatomaceous earth silica is greater than 5 up to 20 , preferably 12 18 of the dentifrice. The ratio of silicate to silica is 0.5 1 1.5 1. The abrasive system in the dentifrice can contain other abrasive agents if desired. Such other abrasives include calcium carbonate, dicalcium phosphate, tricalcium phosphate, calcium pyrophosphate, the corresponding water insoluble magnesium salts, hydrated silica, alumina trihydrate, and the like. Such other abrasives are not essential and, indeed, it has been found that a combination of 10 anhydrous aluminum silicate and 15 diatomaceous silica based on the weight of the dentifrice, i.e. a ratio of 0.67 1, provides an excellent high polishing, high cleaning dentifrice which is not overly abrasive. The abrasive system will generally be 10 35 of the dentifrice. The most preferred present formula contains 25 of the abrasive system. In general, raising the level of the abrasive system does not significantly improve the cleaning capacities of the dentifrice but it can significantly increase the radioactive dentin abrasion index and thus result in potential damage to the oral hard tissues. This is demonstrated in the examples below. The radioactive dentin abrasion index of the dentifrice should not exceed 150 and preferably the average index should not exceed 130. The balance of the dentifrice is a conventional non toxic paste. Any conventional paste composition can be used. As such, paste vehicles provide a mass of a consistency which desirably can be extruded from a container such as an aluminum tube, a laminated tube or a pump type dispenser. In general, the paste contains water usually combined with a humectant such as glycerine, sorbitol or the like. The paste often contains organic surface active agents which can be anionic, nonionic, ampholytic or cationic in nature. It is preferred to employ as the surfactant a material which inparts detersive and foaming properties to the composition. Examples of detergents which can be used include the water soluble salts of higher fatty acid monoglyceride monosulfates such as monosulfated monoglyceride of hydrogenated coconut oil fatty acids sodium salt, higher alkyl sulfates such as soldium lauryl sulfate, alkyl aryl sulfonates such as sodium dodecyl sulfonate, olefin sulfonates such as sodium olefin sulfonate in which the olefin group contains 12 21 carbon atoms, higher alkyl sulfoacetates, higher fatty acid esters of dihydroxy propane sulfonates, substantially saturated higher aliphatic acylamides of lower aliphatic amino carboxylic acid compounds, condensates of ethylene oxide with sorbitan monostearate or with propylene oxide condensates of propylene glycol, quaternized imidazole derivatives and the like. Any suitable flavoring or sweetening material can be employed. Examples include the flavoring oils such as the oils of spearmint, peppermint, wintergreen, clove, eucalyptus, as well as methylsalicylate. Suitable sweetening agents include sorbitol, sodium cyclamate, sodium saccharin, aspartame and the like. The dentifrice can also contain a suitably selected fluoride containing compound having a beneficial effect on the care and hygiene of the oral cavity. Examples of known fluoride compounds in this category include sodium fluoride, stannous fluoride, potassium fluoride, potassium stannous fluoride, sodium hexafluorostanate, stannous chlorofluoride, sodium fluorozirconate, and sodium monofluorophosphate. Sodium fluoride and and sodium monofluorophosphate are particularly preferred. The dentifrice abrasive combination provides for excellent fluoride stability during product aging and does not interfere with fluoride bioavailability as measured by enamel fluoride uptake and enamel reduction studies. The dentifrice can also contain coloring or whitening agents or dyestuffs, preservatives, and the like. If desired, a gelling agent such as the natural and synthetic gums and gum like materials exemplified by gum tragacanth, hydroxyethylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, polyvinyl pyrrolidone and the like, can be used. The various ingredients of the dentifrice are compounded in the conventional fashion. In order to further illustrate the invention, the various examples are set forth below. In these examples, as well as throughout this specification and claims, all parts and percentages are by weight. A dentifrice was prepared from the following ingredients A dentifrice was prepared from the following ingredients A dentifrice was prepared from the following ingredients A cleaning study was carried out using an in vitro coffee tea stained pellicle model developed at the Oral Health Research Institute, Indiana University, and described in J. Dent. Res. 61 11 1236 1239, 1982. In this study, the dentifrices of Examples 1, 2, and 3 were compared to a leading commercial family toothpaste, Crest, which contains hydrated silica as the abrasive and to a leading commercial stain removal toothpaste, Topol F, which uses insoluble sodium metaphosphate as the abrasive. The results obtained were as follows The results set forth in the foregoing table demonstrate that the dentifrices of Examples 1, 2 and 3 provide superior cleaning efficacy compared to the leading commercial family toothpaste Crest and a leading stain removal toothpaste Topol F. The table also shows that the Example 3 dentifrice, while providing a superior cleaning efficacy to Crest and Topol F, was too abrasive as shown by the radioactive dentin abrasion index of 174, which may lead to damage of oral tissues. Examples 1 and 2 provide a similar superior cleaning performance see cleaning ratios with Crest defined as 100 while maintaining an acceptable abrasivity level.
