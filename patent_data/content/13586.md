# Process for the combined manufacture of chlorinated hydrocarbons and sodium bicarbonate.

## Abstract
Production of sodium bicarbonate by the Solvay soda method 5 , employing a voltatile aliphatic amine TMA instead of ammonia, is combined with the oxychlorination C of olefins in liquid phase by using the amine hydrochloride side product of the soda plant as chlorine source in the oxida tive regeneration R of the spent chlorinating liquid. The chlorinating liquid C contains iodine and copper chloride or iron chloride and on regenerating R the spent liquid the amine is recovered in the vapor phase and recycled to the soda plant S .
