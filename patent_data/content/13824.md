## Description
EUROPEAN PATENT CONVENTION SPE C IFICATION TITLECOATING COMPOSITIONS INCLUDING OLIGOMERIC HYDROXY PHOSPHATE CATALYST DESCRIPTION This invention relates to coating compositions of the type comprising a film forming component and an amino compounds, wherein the composition cures by reaction between the amino compound and hydroxy functionality present on the film forming material. More particularly, the invention relates to thermosetting coating compositions of the aforementioned type wherein the composition includes at least one hydroxy functional organophosphate ester selected from certain mono and diesters of phosphoric acid. Thermosetting coating compositions which cure by reaction of hydroxy functionality with an amino compound are well known in the art. It ia also well recognized in the art that it is desirable to catalyze the hydroxy amino crosslinking reaction in order to attain a quicker and more complete cure of the coating composition.To this end, catalysts for this reaction have been developed and are also well known. U.S. Patents 3,960,979 and 4,018,848 to Khanna teach high solids coating compositions adapted for use as a can coating material. The compositions consist essentially of i aromatic epoxide compositions having two or more epoxy groups on an epoxy resin which has a molecular weight not exceeding 2500 ii an amino crosslinking agent iii an inorganic or organic monomeric or polymeric acid which acts as a reactive catalyst and iv a flexibilizing polyol. The compositions of Khanna have the advantage of quick reaction and low application viscosity, but lack durability, and, therefore, do not weather well. This is, in part, because of the presence of ether linkages in the aromatic epoxides. As such, the compositions of Khanna are not desirable for use as automotive topcoats. The Khanna patents describe the compositions as a low cure system. However, when considering the specific teachings of the patents one finds that the compositions includes an excess of epoxide resin, apparently with the purpose of killing off excess catalyst after completion of the curing reaction. Excess epoxy resin in the composition remains uncured at the low temperature bake range of the baking temperatures disclosed, not giving a complete cure and desirable hardness, durability or solvent resistance.If heated to higher temperatures, as called for in the examples, the excess epoxy does react with excess hydroxy functionality to give still further ether linkages. These ether linkages so obtained have a further deleterious effect on durability and make the materials particularly unsuitable for use as an automotive topcoat. Also, the necessary high bake temperatures to achieve the utilization of this excess epoxy makes the composition undesirable from an energy point of view. Still further, because the epoxy catalyst reaction occurs in early stages of the cure, thus killing off the catalyst, the melamine hydroxy curing reaction must proceed substantially without benefit of catalysis.The curing reaction thus proceeds slowly and requires the higher temperatures of the Khanna ex tWes, Because of increasingly strict solvent emissions regulations in recent years, low solvent emission paints have become very desirable. A number of high solids paint compositions have been proposed to meet these low solvent emisaion requirements. However, many of these compositions are deficient because of difficulty in application, slow curing rates, lack of flexibility, poor durability and low solvent and water resistance. Many of the proposed compo actions have been particularly deficient as automotive topcoats, particularly when the topcoat is to include metallic flake as a pigment. The deficiency in compositions including metallic flake results from undesired reorientation of the metallic flake during application and cure oP the coating. Flake reorientation results primarily because of the very low viscosity resins used in the paint compositions to accommodate high solids. The low viscosity is not sufficient to immobilize the flakes which tend to redistribute themselves to show reverse flop and nonuniform distribution. According to the present invention, there is provided a coating composition comprising a film forming component and an amino compound, which composition cures by reaction between said amino compound and hydroxy functionality present in said film forming component, characterised in that the composition includes a catalyst for said reaction comprising at least one hydroxy functional organophosphate ester having the formula EMI4.1 wherein n 1 to 2 and the or each groups independently selected from mono and dihydroxy radicals containing one or more ester linkages and having a molicular weight of between about 120 and about 1500. The use of ssuch digomeric hydroxy functional organophosphate ester catalyzed compositions exhibits rapid cure at low temperature and produces coatings with superior properties. In addition, the oligomeric hydroxy functional organophosphate ester catalyst does not become involved in deleterious side reactions as is the case with many conventional catalysts and has the further advantage of not leaching out of the coating composition after curing is completed. More specifically, the catalyzed coating compositions of the invention include the broad class of thermosetting compositions wherein hydroxy functionality is either initially present, generated in situ, or both initially present, and generated in situ, is cross liDksd with conventional amino functional crosslinking agents. As will be more fully described hereinafter, the hydroxy functionality which may be generated in situ may be generated in any manner known to the art with respect to this type of composition or it may be generated by a reaction between the catalyst itself and functionality in the film forming material, in particular, between the catalyst and epoxy functionality in the film forming material.In this case, the catalyst serves as a reactant which helps generate the hydroxy functionality subsequently engaged in the crosslinking reaction with the amino compound. The preferred compositions of the invention contain greater than about 60 percent by weight of nonvolatile solids, preferably greater than about 70 percent by weight, and are capable of curing rapidly at low temperature. These compositions, exclusive of pig fonts, solvents and other non reactive components, consists essent ially of A a fill forming resin bearing epoxy functionality or both epoxy and hydroxy functionality B the catalyst described above C an amino crosslinking agent and D up to about 45 weight percent based on the total of A , B , C and D of a hydroxy functional additive. The oligozeric organophosphate ester is included in the composition in an amount sufficient to provide between about 0.8 md about 1.5 equivalents, preferably between about 0.9 and about 1.2 equivalents, of acid functionality fr each equivalent of epoxy functionality on the fili forming resin.The amino resin cross linking agent is included in the coiposition in an amount sufficient to provide at least about .4 equivalents, preferably between about .6 and 2.1 equivalents, of nitrogen crosslinking functionality for each equivalent of hydroxy functionality included in the composition either as i an organic hydroxyl group on the oligomoric organopho iphate ester, ii hydroxy functionality on the fili forming resin, iii a hydroxyl group on the optional hydroxy functional additive, or iv as a result of esterification of the epoxy functionality of the film forming resin during cure of the coating composition. other ingredients of the coaposition My include additives such as catalysts, antioxidants, U.V. absorbers, flow control or wetting agents, antistatic agents, pigments, plasticizers, solvents, etc. The preferred coating compositions of this invention com bine the above discussed desired propoerties and low application viscosity with rapid cure so as to overcome deficiencies of previ ously proposed high solids materials and thereby achieve a high solids coating composition particularly adapted for automotive topcoats and still more particularly adapted for automotive topcoats including metallic flake as a pigment. Particularly preferred coipositions within the scope of the invention are fast curing, high solids, thernoletting coating coipositions. lore particularly, these preferred coipositions are adapted to provide an automotive topcoat which demonstrates hardness, EMI6.1 high gloss, outstanding durability and excellent resistance to solvents and water. 8till more particularly, the preferred comp positions are fast curing, high solids, thermosetting coating compositions adapted to bemused as an automotive topcoat including metallic flake as a pigment. As discussed generally above, the coating compositions of the invention are thermoqetting materials comprising a film forming material bearing hydroxy functionality which is formed bv in situ reaction, an amino compound croaslinking agent, and the improved catalyst of the invention comprising at least one oligomeric hydroxy functional organophosphate ester selected from certain mono and diesters of phosphoric acid. The preferred high solids coating composition of the invention overcome disadvantages of prior art high solids composit ions, including those of the Khanna patents discussed above, to provide a system which is particularly suitable for those applications requiring high gloss, hardness durability, and high solvent and water resistance as well as a fast cure rate at low temperatures, e.g., between about 750C and about 1500C, preferably between about 1100C and about 13000. The desirable characteristics of these preferred compositions of the Invention result from the carefully controlled admixture of the particular components, including an oligomeric hydroxy functional organophosphate ester, to achieve substantially complete utilization of reactant functionality and a resultant highly crosslinked coating in a fast and efficient manner. Each of the components of the compositions of the invention, in general, and the high solids coating compositions in particular, are described hereinafter in greater detail.Organophosphate Ester The novel oligomeric hydroxy functional organophosphate ester is present in the compositions of the invention as a mono or diester of phosphoric acid or as a mixture of such mono and diesters. The hydroxy functional organophosphate esters useful in the composition of the invention are those having the formula EMI7.1 wherein n 1 to 2 and R is selected from the group consisting of mono or dihydroxy radicals containing one or more ester linkages and having a molecular weight of between about 120 and about 1500. A preferred method for preparing the oligomeric hydroxy functional organophosphate esters useful in compositions of the invention is by an esterification reaction between an excess of a di or trihydroxy alkyl, cycloalkyl or aryl oligoester and phosphorus pentoxide. When a trihydroxy oligoester is used as a reactant, preferably at least one of the hydroxyl groups should be secondary. The reaction between the di or trihydroxy oligoester and the phosphorus pentoxide is generally carried out by adding phosphorus pentoxide portionwise to an excess of the di or trihydroxy oligoester in a liquid state or in solution in a suitable solvent.Suitable solvents include, but are not limited to, butyl acetate, methyl ethyl ketone, toluene, xylene, etc. The hydroxy functional oligoesters useful in preparing the oligomeric hydroxy functional organosphosphate esters used in the compositions of the invention have a molecular weight of between about 120 and about 1500. Such oligoesters may be prepared in accordance with numerous procedures recognized in the art.For example, the hydroxy functional oligoesters may be selected from the group consisting of i dihydroxy oligoesters prepared by reacting a dicarboxylic acid with a monoepoxide, ii trihydroxy oligoesters prepared by reacting a monohydroxy dicarboxylic acid with a monoepoxide iii dihydroxy oligoesters prepared by reacting a monocarboxylic acid with a diepoxide iv trihydroxy oligoesters prepared by reacting a monocarboxylic acid with a monohydroxy diepoxide v dihydroxy oligoesters prepared by reacting a monohydroxy monocarboxylic acid with a monoepoxide vi trihydroxy oligoesters prepared by reacting a monohydroxycarboxylic acid with a monohydroxy monoepoxide viii trihydroxy oligoesters prepared by reacting a monocarboxylic acid with a dihydroxy monoepoxide ix dihydroxy oligoesters prepared by reacting a monocarboxylic acid with a monohydroxy monoepoxide and x di or trihydroxy oligoesters prepared by reacting polycaprolactones with diols or triols. Dihydroxyoligoesters prepared by reacting a dicarboxylic acid with a monoepoxide and designated by i above are well known in the art. The most common of this group is a low molecular weight adduct of an aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or aryl dicarboxylic acid and a monoepoxide.Most commonly used monoepoxides are alkylene oxides such as ethylene oxide or propylene oxide. Among the numerous dicarboxylic acids which may be used are malonic acid, succinic acid, glutaric acid, 1,9 nonanedioic acid, 1 ,4 cyclohexaned icarboxyl ic acid, terephthal ic acid, etc.Preferred dicarboxylic acids are C6 C12 aliphatic acids as well as mixtures of these acids or mixtures of the aliphatic dicarboxylic acids with cycloaliphatic or aromatic dicarboxylic acids. The above described adducts, which are prepared by reacting the acid and epoxide in the presence of a catalyst, have a narrow molecular weight distribution when compared to similar compositions made by normal polyester manufacturing techniques. While the specific reactants enumerated above will result in compounds containing two 2 ester groups, it will be appreciated that additional ester linkages may be present in the compound as a result of being included as a part of a radical born by either the monoepoxide or the dicarboxylic acid.For example, an oligoester bearing more than two ester linkages may be prepared by reacting dicarboxylic acid with a glycidyl carboxylate monoepoxide.This reaction results in a dihydroxy oligoester bearing four 4 ester linkages. Of course, various other combinations of dibasic acids and monoepoxides will be apparent to the skilled artisan. In preparing the trihydroxy oligoesters designated as ii above, numerous monohydroxy dicarboxylic acids may be employed in lieu of the dicarboxylic acids previously described. Representative of these monohydroxy aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or aromatic dicarboxylic acids are malic acid, hydroxyglutaric acid, 2 hydroxy 1,4 cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid and 2 methylol terephthalic acid. As witn oligoesters designated by i above, the preferred monohydroxydicarboxylic acids are C6 C12 aliphatic acids, mixtures of those acids or mixtures of those acids with cycloaliphatic or aromatic dicarboxylic acids. In preparing dihydroxy oligoesters designated as iii above, a monocarboxylic acid is reacted with a diepoxide. Representative of the numerous aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or aromatic monocarboxylic acids which may be used are pentanoic acid, hexanoic acid, heptanoic acid, cyclohexane carboxylic acid and benzoic acid. Preferred monocarboxylic acids are acetic acid, propionic acid and butyric acid. Among the numerous suitable diepoxides which will be apparent to those skilled in the art are cycloaliphatic diepoxides and glycidyl ethers of aliphatic and aromatic dihydroxy compounds. As was the case above, polyester linkages other than those resulting from the esterification reaction between the acid and epoxy groups may be included by using acids or diepoxides containing a radical bearing one or more ester linkages. For example, acetic acid could be reacted with bis 3,4 epoxy 6 methyloyclohexylmethyl adipate to yield an oligoester with four 4 ester linkages. Trihydroxy oligoesters designated iv may be prepared by reacting monocarboxylic acids such as described in iii with monohydroxy diepoxides. Typical monohydroxy diepoxides are hydroxyglycidyl ethers of bisphenol A and aliphatic hydroxyglycidyl resins. As above, radicals bearing additional ester linkages may be included in the acid or diepoxide. Dihydroxy oligoesters designated as v above may be prepared by reacting a monohydroxy monocarboxylic acid with a monoepoxide. Representative of the numerous aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or aromatic monohydroxy monocarboxylic acids are 3hydroxybutyric acid, 4 hydroxycyclohexylcarboxylic acid and 4methylol benzoic acid. Suitable monoepoxides are enumerated above in the discussion of oligoesters i and ii . As in all cases, radicals bearing additional ester linkages may be included. The trihydroxy oligoester of vi is a variation of v with the reactants being a monoepoxide as above and a dihydroxymonocarboxylic acid, such as 3,4 trihydroxybutyric acid and glyciric acid. The trihydroxy oligoester of vii is prepared by reacting a monohydroxy monocarboxylic acid such as in v above with a monohydroxy monoepoxide such as, for example, glycidol and l,4 butanediolmonoglycidyl ether. As in other cases, additional ester linkages may also be included in the oligoester. The trihydroxy oligoester designated viii may be prepared by reacting a monocarboxylic acid as above with a dihydroxy monoepoxide such as acetic acid with 2,3 epoxy 1, 4 butane diol. Additional ester linkages may be included, if desired. The dihydroxy oligoester ix is prepared by reacting a monocarboxylic acid with a monohydroxy monoepoxide. Both reactants are discussed above and, as in other cases, additional ester linkages may be added using ester bearing radicals. Hydroxy functional oligoesters of the type designated by x above are known in the art. Caprolactones reacted with diols yield dihydroxy oligoesters while reaction with triols yields trihydroxy oligoesters. A preferred temperature for carrying out the reaction between the hydroxy functional oligoester and the phosphorus pentoxide is between about 500C and about 550C. Due to the multiple hydroxy functionality of the di or trihydrox oligoester, minor amounts of polymeric acid phosphate as we 1 as certain cyclophosphates are also generated during the synthesis. These polymeric and cyclic materials also serve as a reactive catalyst and, therefore, need not be separated from the hydroxyphosphate esters described above. In fact, it has been found advantageous in preferred embodiments of the invention to employ all reaction products, i.e., the hydroxy functional organophosphate esters and the minor amount of polymeric acid phosphate cyclophosphates, as well as excess di or trihydroxy oligoester in the coating compositions.The excess di or trihydroxy oligoester serves in those compositions as the optional hydroxy functional additive.Reactive catalysts prepared by the above preferred method will generally include about a l to 1 ratio of the mono and diester organophosphate. The oligomeric hydroxy functional organophosphate ester component of the thermosetting coating composition of the invention is a reactive catalyst which allows the composition to cure rapidly at a low temperature. The e hydroxy functionality present on the oligomeric hydroxy functional organophosphate ester engages in the crosslinking reaction by reacting with the amino compound in addition to catalyzing the reaction between the amino compound and the hydroxy functionality present in the film forming materials. It is this reaction of the hydroxy functionality of the oligomeric hydroxy functional organophosphate ester which probably accounts for the fact that the catalyst does not leach out of the finally cured composition.Thus, the catalyst serves not only to catalyze the reaction between the film forming material and the crosslinking agent, but also to more completely tie up the matrix of the composition and provide a more completely integrated crosslinked composition. In those embodiments of the invention wherein the film forming material also includes an epoxy material, either on the same compound as the hydroxy functionality or on a separate compound forming a part of the film forming material, the oligomeric hydroxy functional organophosphate ester catalyst of the invention serves as a reactive catalyst in another sense. In this case, the acid functionality of the mono or diester or mixture of such esters reacts with the epoxy functionality of the film forming material to form an ester and a hydroxyl group.This hydroxyl group, as well as the organic hydroxyl groups on the oligomeric hydroxy functional organophosphate ester and the other hydroxy functionality which may be present in the film forming material is available for crosslinking with the amino crosslinking agent. The amount of the oligomeric hydroxy functional organophosphate catalyst which is included in the compositions of the invention will vary depending upon the nature of the film forming material employed and is a matter of choice which will be made by one skilled in the art.Film Forming Material As discussed above, film forming materials which either include hydroxy functionality initially, generate hydroxy functionality as a result of in situ reactions during the coating process or both include hydroxy functionality initially and generate it in situ, are well known to those skilled in the art. Selection of those materials will be a matter of choice and it will be recognized that the oligomeric hydroxy functional organophosphate catalyst is equally applicable to all such hydroxy bearing film forming materials crosslinked with amino compound. While it is intended that all such hydroxy bearing film forming materials be included within the scope of the invention, several of these materials will be discussed below in greater detail for purposes of exemplification. As discussed above, the film forming material may consist essentially of a compound which bears hydroxy functionality prior to initiation of the curing reaction. In most coating compositions, such materials should have a number average molecular weight Mn of at least 150. A preferred type of hydroxy functional material which meets these limitations consists essentially of a copolymer bearing pendent hydroxy functionality. One class of such materials has a number average molecular weight Mn of between about 1000 and about 20,000 and a glass transition temperature Tg of between about 250C and about 700C. Such a copolymer may, for example, consist of between about 5 and about 30 weight percent of monoethylenically unsaturated monomers bearing hydroxy functionality and between about 95 and about 70 weight percent of other monoethylenically unsaturated monomers. The long list of hydroxy functional monomers which may be employed in these hydroxy functional copolymers includes, but is not limited to, the following esters of acrylic or methacrylic acid and aliphatic alcohols 2 hydroxyethyl acrylate 3 chloro 2 hydroxypropyl acrylate 2 hydroxy l methylethyl acrylate 2 hydroxypropyl acrylate 3 hydroxypropyl acrylate 2,3 dihydroxypropyl acrylate 2 hydroxybutyl acrylate 4 hydroxybutyl acrylate diethyleneglycol acrylate 5 hydroxypentyl acryl ate 6 hydroxyhexyl acryl ate triethyleneglycol acrylate 7 hydroxyheptyl acrylate 2 hydroxymethyl methacrylate 3 chloro 2 hydroxy propyl methacrylate 2 hydroxy l methylethyl methacrylate 2 hydroxypropyl methacrylate 3 hydroxypropyl methacrylate 2,3 dihydroxypropyl methacrylate 2 hydroxybutyl methacrylate 4hydroxybutyl methacrylate 3,4 dihydroxybutyl methacrylate 5 hydroxypentyl methacrylate 6 hydroxy hexyl methacrylate 1, 3 dimethyl 3 hydroxybutyl methacrylate 5 r 5, 6 dihydroxyhexyl methacrylate and 7 hydroxyheptyl methacrylate. Although one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that many different hydroxy bearing monomers including those listed above could be employed, the preferred hydroxy functional monomers for use in the hydroxy functional resin of the invention are C5 C7 hydroxy alkyl acrylates and or C6 Cg hydroxy alkyl methacrylates, i.e., esters ofC2 C3 dihydric alcohols and acrylic or methacrylic acids. The remainder of the monomers forming the hydroxy functional copolymer, i.e., between about 90 and about 70 weight percent, are other monoethylenically unsaturated monomers. These monoethylenically unsaturated monomers, are preferably alpha, beta olefinically unsaturated monomers, i.e., monomers bearing olefinic unsaturation between the two carbon atoms in the alpha and beta positions with respect to the terminus of an aliphatic carbon to carbon chain. Among the alpha beta olefinically unsaturated monomers which may be employed in such copolymers are acrylates meaning esters of either acrylic or methacrylic acids as well as mixtures of acrylates and vinyl hydrocarbons. Preferably, in excess of 50 weight percent of the total of the copolymer monomers are esters of C1 C12 monohydric alcohols and acrylic or methacrylic acids, e.g., methylmethacrylate, 2 ethylhexylacrylate, laurylmethacrylate, etc. Among the monovinyl hydrocarbons suitable for use in forming the copolymers are those containing 8 to 12 carbon atoms and including styrene, alpha methylstyrene, vinyl toluene, t butystyrene and chlorostyrene. When such monovinyl hydrocarbons are employed, they should constitute less than 50 weight percent of the copolymer.Other monomers such as vinyl chloride, acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile, and vinyl acetate may be included in the copolymer as modifying monomers.However, when employed, these modifying monomers should constitute only between about 0 and about 30 weight percent of the monomers in the copolymer. As mentioned above, the film forming material may contain both hydroxy functionality and a material which reacts in situ to form hydroxy functionality. Exemplary of one such film forming material would be a material which consists essentially of a single copolymer bearing both hydroxy and epoxy functionality, the epoxy functionality reacting with the acid functionality of the hydroxy functional organophosphate ester as discussed above to form hydroxy functionality which thereafter may also react with the amino crosslinking agent.Such a difunctional copolymer may be of the acrylic type similar to the hydroxy functional copolymer discussed above.A preferred bifunctional copolymer of this type has a number average molecular weight Mn of between about 1500 and about 10,000 and a glass transition temperature Tg of between about 250C and about 700C. Such a copolymer preferably is formed from between about 5 and 25 weight percent of monoethylenically unsaturated monomers bearing hydroxy functionality, with the total of the monoethylenically unsaturated monomers bearing either said glycidyl functionality or said hydroxy functionality being not greater than 30 weight percent of the monomers in the copolymer. The monoethylenically unsaturated monomers bearing glycidyl functionality may be either glycidyl ethers or glycidyl esters. Preferably, however, the epoxy functional monomers are glycidyl esters of monoethylenically, unsaturated carboxylic acids. Examples are glycidyl acrylates and glycidyl methacrylates.The remainder of the monomers in the copolymer, i.e., between about 90 and about 70 weight percent, consist of other monoethylenically unsaturated monomers, such as those described above. Also as mentioned above, the film forming material may consist essentially of a compound which reacts in situ to form hydroxy functionality, i.e., a compound not initially including hydroxy functionality. Such a compound could be, for example, a copolymer such as those described above, but bearing only glycidyl functionality. Such a copolymer bearing pendent functionality would have a number average molecular weight Mn of between about 1500 and about 10,000, preferably between about 2,000 and about 6,000, and a glass transition temperature Tg of between about 250C and about 700C, preferably between about 100C and about 500C.A preferred copolymer of this type consists of between about 10 and about 30 weight percent of monoethylenically unsaturated monomers bearing glycidyl functionality and between about 90 and about 70 weight percent of other monoethylenically unsaturated monomers, as discussed above. Still another compound bearing epoxy functionality which may be employed when solely epoxy functionality, which in turn will react with the acid functionality of the organophosphate ester to form hydroxy functionality, is desired is a polyepoxide resin having a number average molecular weight of between about 140 and about 3000, preferably between about 300 and about 2,000. The term polyepoxide resin as used herein means epoxide compounds or polymers containing two or more epxoide groups. Such polyepoxide resins could be selected from aliphatic, cycloaliphatic and aromatic polyepoxides falling within the stated molecular weight range. Such polyepoxides are well known compositions and any of these may be employed. Among the many suitable types of polyepoxides are those disclosed by U.S. Patents 3,404,018 2,528,359 2,528,360 3,198,850 3,960,979 and 4,018,848. U.S. Patent 3,404,018 discloses several particularly suitable types of polyepoxides including 1 polyglycidyl ethers of polyhydric alcohols and polyhydric phenols 2 epoxidized esters of polyethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic acids 3 glycidyl esters of polybasic acids 4 epoxidized esters of unsaturated monohydric alcohols and polycarboxylic acids and 5 epoxidized polymers and copolymers of diolefins. Many polyepoxides other than those recited in this or other referenced patents will be apparent to those skilled in the art. As also mentioned above, there may be those instances when the film forming material desirably comprises separate compounds, one or more bearing hydroxy functionality and one or more others bearing functionality which reacts in situ to form hydroxy functionality. Such film forming materials might, for example, consist of the above noted hydroxy functional copolymer combined with the epoxy functional copolymer discussed above or the polyepoxide resin discussed above. Various other combinations of materials, of course, will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Still other film forming materials are exemplified in the detailed examples set forth hereinafter. Amino Crosslinking Agent Amino crosslinking agent suitable for crosslinking hydroxy functional bearing materials are well known in the art and their selection will be obvious to those skilled in the art. Typically, the crosslinking materials are products of reactions of melamine or urea with formaldehyde and various alcohols containing up to and including 4 carbon atoms. Among the numerous materials which may be employed are the amine aldehyde resins such as condensation products of formaldehyde with melamine, substituted melamine, urea, benzoguanamine or substituted benzoguanamine. Preferred members of this class are methylated melamine formaldehyde resins such as hexamethoxymethyl melamine. These liquid crosslinking agents have substantially one hundred percent 100 nonvolatile content as measured by the foil method at 450C for 45 minutes.Some particularly well known crosslinking agents are the amino resins sold by American Cyanamid under the trademark SCymel . In particular, Cymel 301, Cymel 303, and Cymel 1156, which are alkylated melamine formaldehyde resins are useful in compositions falling within the scope of this invention. Of course, the amount of crosslinking agent employed in any given composition is a matter of choice depending upon the final properties desired and the nature of the other materials in the coating composition.Preferred High Solids Coating Compositions As indicated above, the high solids coating compositions within the scope of the invention include a film forming resin bearing epoxy functionality or both epoxy and hydroxy functionality. Materials suitable for use in preparing the high solids compositions of the invention are the acrylic copolymers bearing glycidyl functionality or glycidyl and hydroxy functionality and the polyepxoide resins, all of which are described hereinbefore. In addition to the film forming resin and the oligomeric organophosphate ester the compositions also include an amino crosslinking agent generally described above and an optional hydroxy functional additive in an amount up to 45 weight percent of the total of the four major components of the composition. The hydroxy functional additives provide additional hydroxy functionality so as to provide a more intimate crosslinked structure in the final cured product.These additives are typically selected from various polyols having a number average molecular weight Mn of between about 150 and about 6,000, preferably between about 400 and about 2,500. As used herein the term polyol means a compound having two or more hydroxyl groups. The e polyols useful for the preferred high solids compositions of the invention preferably are selected from the group consisting of i hydroxy functional polyesters ii hydroxy functional polyethers iii hydroxy functional oligoesters iv monomeric polyols v hydroxy functional copolymers produced by free radical polymerization of monoethylenically unsaturated monomers, one of which bears hydroxy functionality and which is included in the copolymer in an amount ranging from about 2.5 to about 30 weight percent of the copolymer and vi mixtures of i v . The hydroxy functional polyesters useful in these preferred compositions are preferbly fully saturated products prepared from aliphatic dibasic acids containing 2 20 carbon atoms, such as succinic acid, glutaric acid, adipic acid, azelaic acid, etc., and short chain glycols of up to and including 21 carbon atoms, such as ethylene glycol, 1,2 propylene glycol, 1,3 propylene glycol, 1,2 butylene glycol, 1,3 butylene glycol, 1,4 butylene glycol, neopentyl glycol, 1,4 cyclohexane dimethylol, 1,6 hexamethylene glycol and 2 ethyl 2 methyl 1,3 propane diol. The molecular weight of these materials ranges from about 200 to about 2,500 and the hydroxyl number ranges from about 30 to about 230.The hydroxyl number is defined as the number of milligrams of potassium hydroxide needed for each gram of sample to neutralize the acetic acid generated during the reaction between the polyol and the excess acetic anhydride. The polyester polyols utilized in the compositions are low metling, soft waxy solids which are easily maintained in the molten state. Among preferred polyesters are products derived from the esterification of ethylene glycol and 1,4 butane diol with adipic acid, ethylene glycol and 1,2 propylene glycol with adipic acid, azelaic acid and sebacic acid copolyester diols, and mixtures thereof. Among useful polyether diols are polytetramethylene ether glycol, polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol and the like. The e hydroxy functional oligoesters useful as hydroxy functional additives in the compositions of the invention are oligoesters preferably having a molecular weight of between about 150 and about 3000. Included in this class of materials are the di or trihydroxy oligoesters described above for use in preparing the oligomeric hydroxy phosphate ester catalysts of the invention. Similar oligoester with molecular weights greater than the 1500 limit of those oligoesters up to the 3000 limit specified above as well as similarly prepared oligoesters bearing more than three hydroxyl groups may be employed. Among the numerous monomeric polyols which may be employed as the hydroxy functional additive are the various short chain glycols of up to and including 21 carbon atoms which are useful in preparing the hydroxy functional polyesters discussed above. Other conventional polyhydric alcohols such as glycerols and sugar alcohols are also among the numerous monomeric polyols which will be apparent to those skilled in the art. The hydroxy bearing copolymer described above for use as a film forming material for compositions of the invention, in general may also be used as a hydroxy functional additive in the preferred high solids coating compositions of the invention. It is the reactive nature of the oligomeric hydroxyfunctional organophosphate ester component which allows the composition to cure rapidly at a low temperature. As indicated generally above, the acid functionality of the monoor diester or mixture of such esters reacts with the epoxy functionality of the epoxy functional film former to form an ester and a hydroxyl group. This hydroxyl group, as well as the organic hydroxyl groups on the oligomeric hydroxy functional organophosphate ester, any hydroxyl groups in the film former in addition to the epoxy functionality and any optional hydroxy groups included in the composition in the form of hydroxy functional additive, crosslinks with the amino resin crosslinking agent.It is critical to achieving the desired results of the high solids coating compositions of this invention, i.e., in making them suitable for use as automotive topcoats, that the amount of oligomeric organophosphate ester be sufficient to convert substantially all of the epoxy functionality on the film former to the desired hydroxy functionality by esterification reaction. Therefore, the organophosphate ester is included in the composition in an amount sufficient to provide between about 0.8 and about 1.5 equivalents, preferably between about 0.9 and about 1.2 equivalents, of acid functionality for each equivalent of pendent epoxy functionality on the copolymer. As will be noted from the equivalent amounts of epoxy and organophosphate ester acid functionality stated above, the amount of acid functionality need not be in stoichiometric amounts to the epoxy functionality.This is because of the fact that during curing of the high solids coating composition, residual water present in the composition hydrolyzes some of the esterified product back to acid and this hydrolyzed product then, in turn, reacts with additional epoxy functionality. As also indicated above, the amino resin materials function as a crosslinking agent by reacting with hydroxy functionality present in the composition. In the preferred high solids compositions of the invention this hydroxy functionality may be present i in an organic hydroxyl group on the oligomeric hydroxy functional organophosphate ester, ii as a hydroxyl group on the film former in those cases where that component bears hydroxy as well as epoxy functionality iii as a hydroxyl group on the optional hydroxy functional additive or iv as a result of esterification of the epoxy functionality of the film former. In order to achieve the outstanding properties which makes these preferred high solids coating compositions particularly useful as automotive topcoat materials, it is essential that the amount of amino crosslinking agent be sufficient to substantially completely crosslink the hydroxy functionality in the coating composition. Therefore, the amino resin crossl inking agent should be included in the composition in an amount sufficient to provide at least about .4 equivalents, preferably between about .6 and about 2.1 equivalents, of nitrogen crosslinking functionality for each equivalent of hydroxy functionality included in the composition.Other Materials Of course, it should be recognized that coating compositions within the scope of this invention including the preferred high solids compositions may include other conventional components. These include, but are not limited to, antioxidants, U.V. absorbers, solvents, surface modifiers, wetting agents, pigments, fillers, etc. The invention will be further understood by referring to the following detailed examples. It should be understood that the specific examples are presented by way of illustration and not by way of limitation.
