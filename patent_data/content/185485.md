# SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS

## Abstract
Rotating surveillance systems of the type which detect a moving object within a field of view and provide a represen tative image of the object may suffer from limited sensitivity when having a wide coverage. The system described herein detects and provides an identifiable image of a moving object within its field of view by forming an image of the object on a charge coupled device and determining the rate of relative movement between the image and the device and hence using the rate of relative movement to provide signals which hold the image of the moving object substantially stationary with respect to the imaging sites of the charge coupled device to produce a generally sharp image of the object compared with the background.
