# Potassium ion selective membrane electrode.

## Abstract
In an electrode for determining the potassium ion content of a liquid sample to be tested, the electrode including a membrane having incorporated therein an ion selective component, the improvement in which the ion specific component is a compound of the formula CHEM wherein wherein each R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, and R8 is hydrogen or an alkyl group containing between one and about 20 carbon atoms, p is 0 or 1, n is one or more, and, each s and r, independently, is 1, 2, or 3, provided that, when p is 1, n is 8 or more.
