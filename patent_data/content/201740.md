## Description
The present invention relates generally to a video signal control circuit and, more particularly, is directed to a video signal control circuit such as a frame synchronizer and the like for use with a so called down converter which is used to convert a video signal having a number of scanning lines to a video signal havng scanning lines according to a standard television system. The number of scanning lines of a video signal to reproduce, for example, a high definition television picture is about twice the number of a video signal according to the existing standard television system. When the video signal having a large number of scanning lines e.g., video signal having 1125 horizontal scanning lines is converted to a video signal e.g., video signal having 625 horizontal scanning lines according to the PAL system having scanning lines according to the existing standard television system, it is general that a so called down converter is used for converting the number of horizontal scanning lines. The down converter is provided with the frame synchronizer, in which the above mentioned input video signal is written in a frame memory and a data stored in the frame memory is read out therefrom in synchronism with an internal reference signal provided in the frame synchronizer whereby the number of horizontal scanning lines is reduced and an asynchronous input video signal is synchronized with the internal reference signal and then generated. Since the input video signal is generally not synchronized with the internal reference signal as described above, if in the writing and or reading process in and or from the frame memory the frame memory is capable of storing an input video signal of about two frame periods, the frame memory has to carry out the reading after the writing was ended. As a result, the overlapping of the writing operation and the reading operation will take place about once at each day. In other words, if this overlapping state is left as it is, the timing relation between the writing operation and the reading operation will become closer. Thus, such a state that the writing and reading state, in which the writing and reading are impossible overlapping state , will occur ultimately. The reason for this is that the accuracy of a reference signal generator for an input video signal in many cases, a crystal oscillator is used as the reference generator , accordingly, the accuracy of the crystal oscillator is different from that of a crystal oscillator that is provided in the internal reference signal generator. In the prior art, when the overlapping of the writing operation and the reading operation occurs, for example, when the writing operation precedes the reading operation too much, a writing frame address or field address is stopped during one frame period to thereby delete a data of one picture amount. While, when on the other hand the reading operation precedes the writing operation too much, the data of the same picture is read out again from the overlapping frame to thereby prevent the skipping of the memory. For example, if the write timing delays as to the read timing, as shown in Figs. 1A and 1B, the write timing shown by a write address data, W ADRS, in the illustrated example approaches gradually the read timing shown by R ADRS and at last, the write timing and the read timing coincide with each other. For this reason, if the write timing tends to be delayed as mentioned above, when both the write timing and the read timing approach to each other with a minimum approaching distance in which the data can not be read, that is, with a minimum timing distance Ta therebetween, a read address generator is controlled to be placed in the re reading mode under which the same frame data is read out again. Conversely, if the write timing precedes the read timing, the write timing approaches gradually the read timing as shown in Figs. 1C and 1D so that the write timing and the read timing become coincident with each other ultimately. For this reason, if the write timing tends to precede the read timing as described above, when both the write timing and the read timing approach to each other with a minimum timing distance Tb in which the data can not be written, the write address generator is controlled to be placed in the re writing mode under which the same frame data is written once again. In order to control the write mode and the read mode, frame pulses FR and FW shown in Figs. 2A and 2B of 2 frame periods are formed from the write address data and the read address data, respectively. On the basis of a point at which the write frame pulse FW changes, there are respectively formed pulses Ra and Rb shown in Figs. 2E and 2F. One pulse Ra is used to detect the mode in which the data is read out again so that its pulse width or pulse duration is set to be the distance Ta in which the data can not be read out as described above. Similarly, another pulse Rb is used to detect the mode in which the data is written in again. The pulse duration of the pulse Rb is set to be the distance Tb. By the way, in the prior art, if the overlapping relation between the write timing and the read timing occurs within the data writing disabled spacing Ta and the data reading disabled spacing Tb, the writing and or reading address generator is controlled immediately so as to stop the writing mode or to execute the re reading mode. As a result, this overlapping state frequently takes place in the necessary picture. At that time, if the address generator is controlled so as to delete the data of one frame period or to read the same picture data of one frame period again, an unnatural motion occurs in the animation except for the still picture. Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to provide an improved video signal control circuit which can remove the defects encountered with a prior art video signal control circuit. It is another object of this invention to provide a video signal control circuit in which when the writing mode or reading mode is controlled before the overlapping state of the write and read timings occurs, an unnatural motion can be prevented from occurring even in the animation by skillfully controlling the control timing of the write or read address generator. It is further object of this invention to provide a video signal control circuit which can be applied not only to a frame synchronizer used as a down converter for converting the number of scanning lines but also to a frame synchronizer which synchronizes an asynchronous input video signal with an internal reference signal. According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a video signal control circuit having a memory in which an input digital video signal is written and from which a controlled digital video signal is read out, and a memory control circuit, said video signal control circuit comprising These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of the preferred embodiment taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, throughout which like reference numerals designate like elements and parts. Now, an embodiment of a video signal control circuit according to the present invention will hereinafter be described with reference to the attached drawings. In this case, the present invention is applied, by way of example, to a frame synchronizer. Fig. 3 is a systematic block diagram showing an overall circuit arrangement of a frame synchronizer to which this invention is applied. In this embodiment, the frame synchronizer is used as a frame synchronizer of the above mentioned down converter for converting the number of the scanning lines of the video signal. In Fig. 3, reference numeral 10 generally designates such frame synchronizer. An interlaced scanning input video signal S While, a reference vertical synchronizing signal REF V applied to a terminal 11 is supplied to a read clock generator 12 which then generates a read clock having a predetermined frequency. This read clock from the read clock generator 12 is supplied to a read address generator 13 from which a predetermined read address is derived. Accordingly, on the basis of the resulting read address the frame memory 3 is driven and then the digital video signal is read out therefrom in synchronism with the reference vertical synchronizing signal REF V. The digital video signal thus read is supplied to and converted to an analog signal by a D A digital to analog converter 14 at the rear stage with the result that an output video signal S According to the present invention, such frame synchronizer 10 is provided with a data comparator 16, an address control circuit 20 for controlling the writing in and or reading out from the frame memory 3 and a still picture detecting circuit 40. Since the writing in and or reading out from the frame memory 3 is carried out at the frame period, in order to detect this frame period, of the respective address data generated from the write and read address generators 6 and 13, there are used pulses FW and FR indicative of MSB most significant bit data as frame informations. These pulses FW and FR are both supplied to the data comparator 16 in which they are compared with each other and from which generated is a difference Pc between the write timing and the read timing. This compared pulse Pc indicative of the timing difference is supplied to the address control circuit 20. While the address control circuit 20 is formed of first and second address control circuits 20A and 20B, it is sufficient to use only the first address control circuit 20A in principle as will be described later. Therefore, the first address control circuit 20A will be described first. The first address control circuit 20A comprises a write address control section 21, a read address control section 22 and a timing distance setting section 23 which sets the above mentioned timing distances Tc and Tb. The write address control section 21 is formed of a NAND circuit 21N and a D type flip flop circuit 21F and also the read address control section 22 is formed of a NAND circuit 22N and a D type flip flop circuit 22F. The compared pulse Pc is supplied commonly to the NAND circuits 21N and 22N, while a first pulse Rc having a pulse duration Tc set by the timing distance setting section 23 is supplied to the NAND circuit 22N and a second pulse Rd having a pulse duration Td also set by the setting section 23 is supplied to the NAND circuit 21N. While the timings at which these first and second pulses Rc and Rd are generated are respectively formed at the advanced phase side and the delayed phase side with a point at which the pulse FW is changed as shown in Fig. 2, their pulse durations Tc and Td may be either the same or different. In this embodiment, the pulse durations Tc and Td are selected to be the same. Further, in this embodiment, Tc Td 1 field period is satisfied. NAND outputs NW and NR from the NAND circuits 21N and 22N are respectively supplied to the corresponding flip flop circuits 21F and 22F and thereby first and second control pulses QW and QR are generated at respective inverting output terminals The second address control circuit 20B is formed in the same way as the first address control circuit 20A. Accordingly, the second address control circuit 20B comprises address control sections 25 and 26, and the address control sections 25 and 26 are respectively formed of a pair of AND circuits 25N and 26N and a pair of D type flip flop circuits 25F and 26F. The compared pulse Pc is supplied commonly to the NAND circuits 25N and 26N and third and fourth pulses Ra and Rb, each of which is generated from a timing distance setting section 27, are respectively supplied to the corresponding NAND circuits 25N and 26N. The pulse duration of the third pulse Ra is set to be a minimum timing distance Ta Fig. 2E that indicates a region in which the reading is disable. While, the pulse duration of the fourth pulse Rb is set to be a minimum timing Tb Fig. 2F that indicates a region in which the writing is disable. The durations of the minimum timing distances Ta and Tb are both selected to be about one horizontal period and may be selected to be the same or different. In this embodiment, they are selected to be the same. A third control pulse QW derived from the inverting output terminal Similarly, a fourth control pulse QR derived from the inverting output terminal The writing mode and the reading mode are controlled by the enable pulses EW and ER, respectively. As clocks applied to the clock terminals CK of the flip flop circuits 21F and 22F, there are used clocks CK and Further, in the still picture detecting circuit 40 which is supplied with the digital video signal from the A D converter 2, a one frame preceding video signal digital signal delayed by a one frame memory 41 and a video signal of the current frame are supplied to an adder 42 in which they are added with illustrated polarities Fig. 3 and thereby detected as a motion information signal indicative of the motion between the adjacent two frames. This motion information signal is supplied through a low pass filter 43, which removes a noise component or the like from the motion information signal, to an absolute value level forming circuit 44 which then produces the absolute value of the motion information signal. The motion information signal presented as the absolute value is supplied to a comparator 45 in which it is compared with a reference voltage digital signal having a predetermined level from the voltage source 46. Since the level of the motion information signal is large in the case of an animation, while the level of the motion information signal is small in a still picture or an animation that can be regarded as a still picture, in this embodiment, the above mentioned reference voltage is set to be a voltage near the level of the motion information signal that is provided when the animation can be substantially regarded as the still picture. If the reference voltage is selected to be such value, in the case of the animation, the compared output becomes H high in level, while in the case of the still picture, the compared output becomes L low in level. Since video signals processed in this embodiment are all digitized data, the above mentioned level comparing operation is executed at every sampling operation per one picture, thus the compared output being obtained at the sampling unit. The compared output from the comparator 45 is supplied to a still picture discriminating or judging circuit 47 in which with respect to the level or value H or L of the compared output obtained at one frame period, when the number of the compared output showing the level L in this embodiment is less than a predetermined value, such frame is judged as the level indicative of the animation while when it is more than the predetermined value, such frame is judged as the still picture. When the value of the compared output is judged as the still picture, the still picture judging circuit 47 generates a detected output Ps having the level H . The detected output whose duration is one frame period Ps provided when the compared output is judged as being indicative of the still picture is supplied commonly to the above mentioned AND gate circuits 31 and 35. Subsequently, the operation of the frame synchronizer 10 thus being constructed will be discussed mainly with reference to the state before the overlapping state between the read timing and the write timing occurs. Figs. 4A to 4J are respectively waveform diagrams used to explain the read address control operation under the state that the write address is delayed from the read address. In Fig. 4, a solid line indicates a waveform before the read address generator 13 is controlled to be set in the re reading mode and one dot chain line indicates a waveform after the read address generator 13 is already controlled to be placed in the re reading mode. Although the pulse FR Fig. 4B , which is supplied to the comparator 16, is generated in synchronism with the frame clock CK synchronized with the MSB data of the read address data , the pulse FR is generated after the frame clock CK with a small delay in a time. When the comparator 16 is supplied with the pulses FR and FW Figs. 4B and 4C which show that the distance between the write and read timings is close to œÑ, it generates the compared pulse Pc Fig. 4D which indicates the points at which the pulses FR and FW are changed, respectively. On the other hand, the timing distance setting section 23 generates the first and second pulses Rc and Rd having the predetermined timing distances Tc and Td which are determined beforehand. These first and second pulses Rc and Rd are respectively supplied to the corresponding NAND circuits 21N and 22N together with the compared pulse Pc so that when the pulse duration œÑ is shorter than the pulse duration Tc of the first pulse Rc as shown in Figs. 4D and 4E, the NAND output NR Fig. 4F is derived from the NAND circuit 22N. At that time, since the flip flop circuit 22F is supplid with the clock Under the state that the distance between the write timing and the read timing is close to each other and the pulse duration œÑ of the compared pulse Pc is shorter than the pulse duration Tc of the first pulse Rc as described above, if the video signal applied to the input terminal 1 is the video signal of the animation, the detected output Ps Fig. 4I of the still picture detecting circuit 40 is L in level. However, even in the animation, in most cases, there exists still picture having a period over several frames. As mentioned above, the still picture which is seen as the animation on the whole but which exists in the very short period over several frames is detected by the still picture detecting circuit 40. For convenience sake of explanation, when the still picture is detected in the current frame of the period I Fig. 4 , the detected output Ps Fig. 4I which becomes H only during the period I is produced. The AND gate circuit 35 is turned on by this detected output Ps and the second control pulse QR is supplied through this AND gate circuit 35 to the OR gate circuit 36 so that the OR gate circuit 36 generates the enable pulse ER which is shown in Fig. 4J. By the inversion of this enable pulse ER, the read address generator 13 is controlled so that also the period II in succession to the period I, the read mode of the same frame, that is, even frame in this embodiment shown by one dot chain line in Fig. 4B is presented. As a result, during the period II, the compared pulse Pc is inverted to L , the NAND output NR is inverted to H , accordingly, the second control pulse Rc is inverted to L respectively shown by one dot chain lines in Figs. 4D, 4F and 4H . Further, since the detected output Ps is at level H only during the period I, the enable pulse ER is inverted to L from the level relationship thereamong so that only during the period II, the read address generator 13 is controlled so as to be set in the re reading mode. When the write timing is gradually delayed and the pulse duration œÑ of the compared pulse Pc becomes shorter than the timing distance Tc of the first pulse Rc and only when the detected output Ps is obtained, during the frame period II succeeding to the period I in which the detected output Ps is obtained, the read address generator 13 is controlled so as to set in the re reading mode. Since the clock CK Fig. 4A is supplied to the first flip flop circuit 21F, the first control pulse QW not shown , which is generated from its inverting output terminal On the contrary, when the write timing is gradually advanced, if the pulse duration œÑ of the compared pulse Pc becomes shorter than the pre set timing distance Td as shown in Fig. 5, the resulting NAND output NW from the NAND circuit 21N is latched by the flip flop circuit 21F at the trailing edge of the clock CK so that the first control pulse QW from the flip flop circuit 21F is inverted to the level H Fig. 5G . Under this state, if the detected output Ps Fig. 5H is generated, the enable pulse EW is inverted to the level H for the first time so that the write address generator 6 is controlled to be placed in the re writing mode only during the period I. As a result, the information of one frame amount is made useless. By the way, the explanation has been given so far to the operation of the case where the still picture is detected under the state that the timing relation is established as t Tc and Td. Even in the above mentioned timing relationships, there may be a possibility that the still picture will not be detected at all. In such case, if some countermeasure is not taken, the writing or reading will become impossible. Therefore, in this embodiment shown in Fig. 3, the second address control circuit 20B is provided for the purpose of coping with such case. When the write timing is delayed and the distance œÑ becomes shorter than the minimum timing distance Ta indicative of the read disabled region as shown in Figs. 6B and 6C, the compared pulse Pc shown in Fig. 6D is generated. As described above, when the pulse duration œÑ of the compared pulse Pc becomes shorter than the pulse duration Ta Fig. 6E of the third pulse Ra, since the level of the NAND output NR Fig. 6F , which is latched by the clock In this case, the one frame amount of the animation is utilized again and this is unavoidable. When the write timing is advanced and the timing distance œÑ becomes shorter than the minimum timing distance Tb indicative of the write disable region, the write address control section 25 is operated and hence, the writing mode is controlled by the third control pulse QW . Figs. 7A to 7G are waveform diagrams respectively used to explain this operation. In this case, the detailed explanation thereof will be omitted for simplicity. If the first and second control pulses QW and QR are calculated in the logical OR fashion and then fed to display means though not shown, it is possible to visually confirm the fact that the distance between the write and read timings becomes shorter than the pre determined timing distances Tc and Td. In like manner, if the third and fourth control pulses QW and QR are calculated in the logical OR fashion and then delivered to the display means, it is possible to visually confirm the fact that the distance between the write and read timings becomes shorter than the minimum timing distances Ta and Tb each of which indicates the write disabled region. According to the present invention as set forth above, particularly when the write start timing and the read start timing approach to each other gradually and the distance between the approached write and read start timings is entered into the pre determined timing distances Tc and Td and under this timing relationship only when the still picture is detected, the write address generator 6 or the read address generator 13 is controlled so as to execute the deletion or to carry out the re reading of the same frame data. Accordingly, the data is deleted or utilized again by the use of the data concerning the still picture so that it becomes possible to remove an unnatural motion occurring when the data is deleted or the data is utilized again. In addition, according to the present invention, since the above mentioned control can be carried out automatically, the detection of the still picture can be carried out with higher accuracy than that of the manual operation. Therefore, even when the data is deleted or utilized again, the motion of the picture becomes more natural.
