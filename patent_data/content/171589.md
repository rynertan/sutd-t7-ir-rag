## Description
Collector nozzle in a device for controlling the outflow of cast steel from a ladle or from a tundishThis present invention concerns a collector nozzle in a device for controlling the outflow of cast steel from a ladle or from a tundish.To prevent pollution by the oxygen in the air of cast steel flowing through a collector nozzle in a ladle towards a mold or towards a tundish, the steel flow is protected by a pipe along its length beetween exit from the nozzle and entry into the mold or into the tundish.As however the fit between nozzle and protection pipe is never airtight, the cast steel itself draws air into the pipe. In pre sent practices attempts are made to overcome this drawback by in troducing inert gas under pressure into the upper end of the pipe so as to create a condition of overpressure inside the pipe sufficient to prevent air from entering it. But there are drawbacks even to this practice, the most serious one being that it weakens the upper portion of the protection pipe in which a duct is made for entry of the inert gas and the duct carrying the inert gas is fitted.In addition to the technical problems referred to above, there is another of a different nature, also solved by this present invention together with the others already mentioned.In most cases, but not necessarily, the collector nozzle for a ladle is the nozzle in a mobile part of a slide gate valve consequently in most cases, but not necessarily, the collector nozzle is made of refractory material known in this technical field, and hereinafter it will simply be called the nozzle. When aluminium steels are being cast, and the nozzle is made of refractory material, it happens that the aluminium contained in the steel becomes deposited in the form of oxides on the refractory sides of the hole of the nozzle to a point where the hole through which the steel passes is completel y choked, The problem there fore exists of how to prevent formation of aluminium oxides in the hole of the nozzle of a ladle or of a tundish.This present invention solves all the above problems.The nozzle conforming to this present invention allows inert gas flowing through said nozzle under pressure to reach the area outside the nozzle where said nozzle fits into the protection pipe thus creating in that area overpressure of inert gas that prevents entry of air through the fissures where the mouth of the nozzle enters the protection pipe and allows inert gas flowing under pressure through said nozzle to enter the hole in the nozzle in the area of said hole where deposits would form, to prevent their formation. Porosity of the refractory material used to make the nozzle may be direct or random.Direct porosity is a conventional term indicating that certain techniques have been used to create, in a non porous body, small ducts lying in one or more desired directions, while random porosity indicates the porosity existing throughout the whole of a porous body where the pores lie in all possible directions. The techniques used to create direct porosity in a piece of material are explained in the European patent publication NO 0 083 919 in the name of Osterreichisch Amerikanische Magnesit Aktien. In the first case, in order to carry the inert gas into the desired area, the nozzle is made so as to incorporate the necessary ducts in the second case, to carry the inert gas to the desired area, use will be made of porous materials, or sections of materials, mounted in the mass of refractory material forming the nozzle.According to the invention a randomly porous nozzle incorporates at least one main duct passing round the hole for outflow of the steel, between its own outer wall and the wall of the hole for outflow of steel, a first plurality of secondary ducts connecting each of the above main ducts with said hole, a second plurality of secondary ducts connecting each of said main ducts with the environment outside the nozzle at the latter s lower end.The nozzle comprises a connecting part between each of the above main ducts and an external duct carrying inert gas from a source of inert gas under pressure and comprises devices for controlling entry and pressure of the inert gas. Alternatively the nozzle comprises a first main duct and a first plurality of secondary ducts connecting the first main duct with the above hole, and comprises a second main duct and a second plurality of secondary ducts connecting the second main duct with the environment outside the nozzle at the latters lower end. In this alternative the nozzle comprises two parts for connection to said external duct, one for each main duct, and two devices for controlling entry and pressure of the inert gas, one for each main duct.Another nozzle is a nozzle made of non porous material comprising an insert of randomly porous material in the form of a circular crown coaxial with the longitudinal axis of the hole for outflow of steel, in the desired position along said longitudinal axis, a part connecting an external duct carrying inert gas from a source of inert gas under pressure there being a space inside said insert of randomly porous material and a cavity, all round the lower portion of the nozzle, in which there is a circular aperture at the level of the lower horizontal wall of the nozzle for connecting the cavity with the environment outside the nozzle and comprises a part connecting the cavity with the above external duct, the purpose of all this being to produce a flow of inert gas inside a part of said hole through the inner wall of said insert and a flow of inert gas at the lower end of the nozzle.Alternatively, the lower end of the nozzle made of non porous material is formed of an insert of randomly porous material and the above cavity is closed at the bottom as well as at the top so that inert gas also flows through the entire lower end of the nozzle.Yet another nozzle is made of randomly porous refractory material and comprises a part connecting an external duct carrying inert gas from a source of inert gas under pressure with a space inside said nozzle into which the inert gas penetrates and spreads through all the pores in the nozzle emerging at the wall of the hole for outflow of steel and at the horizon tal wall at the lower end.The invention is explained in greater detail here below aided by drawings showing examples of its realization, in whiep Fig.1 is a side view, partially cut away, of a first execution,Fig.2 is a side view, partially cut away,of a second execution,Fig.3 is a side view, partially cut away, of a third execution,Fig.4 is a side view, partially cut away,of a fourth execution. Fig.1 shows part of a ladle slide gate valve 1 comprising a nozzle 2 held within a metal frame 3 with an interposed layer of suitable cement 4, and a hole 5 for outflow of steel from a ladle. The lower end of the nozzle 2 fits into a pipe 6 placed to protect the cast steel and incorporates a main ringwise duct that is taken outside the nozzle through a segment of tube 8 connected to the duct 9 carrying argon under pressure from a source 10. Duct 9 is opened and closed and gas pressure regulated by a control device 11. A plurality of secondary ducts 12, 13 lead off from the main duct 7. Ducts 12 connect duct 7 with the area of the hole 5, where deposits form, and ducts 13 connect duct 7 with the outside of the nozzle at the top of protection tube 6. The exit to ducts 13 is in the lower horizontal wall of the nozzle so that the argon is blown into the spaces 14 bounded by the nozzle s outer wall , by the inner wall of the protection tube 6 and by the wall enclosing the cast steel 15.Fig.2 shows a nozzle 22 of non porous refractory material comprising an insert 40 of randomly porous refractory material in the form of a circular crown placed in the area of the hole for outflow of steel where the aluminium oxides create deposits, insert 40 comprising a space 41 that functions as a collector of the argon brought in under pressure along the duct 29 that passes through the body of the nozzle and opens into said space a cavity 42, formed between a steel liner 43 and the outer steel frame 44 of the nozzle closed at the top and having a circular aperture 45 at the level of the horizontal lower wall of the nozz Duct 29 has a branch 29A that penetrates into the cavity 42 and comprises an aperture 46 through which the argon enters.As regards insert 40, through the pores of its material the gas under pressure enters the hole 47, entry of gas being conventionally indicated by the arrows F1 the non porous material adjacent to faces A, B, C, of the insert prevents the gas from spreading into the body of the nozzle. With regard to cavity 42, gas under pressure arrives through aperture 45 in the region 48 bounded by the internal wall of the protection pipe 26, by the lower end of the nozzle 22 and by the surface of the cast steel,not shown in the figure, thus creating overpressure in this region that prevents air from entering through the fissure 49, entry of gas being conventionally indicated by the arrows P2. Fig.3 shows a nozzle 32 made of non porous refractory material comprising an insert 40 of randomly porous refractory material and a duct 29 having a branch 29A andacavity 42 exactly the same as the corresponding parts illustrated in Fig.2, except that the cavity 42 is completely closed round the frame 44 and at the lower end of the nozzle 32.At the lower end of the nozzle there is an insert 50 of random ly porous refractory material whose upper surface is adjacent to the non porous material, the outer lateral surface being comprised within the cavity 42, the inner lateral surface form ing the terminating portion of the hole 47 and the lower surface opening into the region 48 bounded as already described with reference to Fig.2. It is therefore clear that the gas passing through duct 29 will penetrate through the insert 40 into the hole 47, as already described with reference to Fig.2, and will penetrate through the insert 50 partly in the terminating portion of hole 47, overcoming the pressure of the steel, and partly in said region 48 where entry of gas is conventionally indicated by the arrows F2. Fig.4 shows the lower part of a tundish 60 and a nozzle 61 made of non porous refractory material in one of the casting holes, comprising an insert 62 of randomly porous refractory material shaped like a circular crown in the area of the hole for outflow of steel where deposits of aluminium oxide form, insert 62 which comprises a space 63 that functions as a collector of the argon brought in under pressure along the duct 64 that penetrates through the lower wall of the tundish and opans out into said space.The argon under pressure reaches the hole 65 through the pores of the material of which the insert is made, entry of gas being conventionally indicated by the arrows Fa,
