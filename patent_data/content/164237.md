# Polyorganosiloxane collectors in the beneficiation of fine coal by froth flotation.

## Abstract
A froth flotation process for the beneficiation of fine coal is disclosed which employs as a collector a water dispersible polyorganosiloxane or a mixture of water dispersible poly organosiloxanes which contain either aryl radicals or aryl radi cals combined with polyethylene oxide and polypropylene ox ide radicals. Preferred polyorganosiloxanes are those which contain both aryl radicals and polyethylene oxide and or poly propylene oxide radical. The process of this invention is espe cially useful for the beneficiation of difficult to float fine coals.
