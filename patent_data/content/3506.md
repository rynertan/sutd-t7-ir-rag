## Description
Metal Raceway Section for Wiring Distribution System This invention relates to.metal raceway sections for installation in fill on slab or fill on grade constructions, and more particularly to metal raceway sections providing enclosed wiring passageways and at least one passagewayforming member.Corrugated metal sheets are known having wide flat bottom channels which are capped by closure members to provide wiring passageways. Such corrugated sheets have been intermingled with conventional corrugated sheets to provide a metal subfloor supporting a covering layer of concrete, see V.S. patent 2,912,848 LEE et al .Cellular metal raceway sections are known which provide at least two parallel cells separated by an intermediate trough and wherein cover strips and chamber defining members enclose the intermediate trough to form an additional unobstructed wiring passageway, see U.S0 patent 3,592,956 FORK .The principal object of this invention is to provide a metal raceway section providing generally parallel wiring passage ways and a passageway forming flute adapted to cooperate with an upper surface presented by a supporting substructure to provide an additional wiring passageway.Another object of this invention is to provide a metal racewai section assembled from a corrugated element and distinct capping elements which are individually packageable in nested relation with others of the same element for shipping compaction, thereby providing a significant reduction in shipping costs.Another object of this invention is to provide a metal raceway section which provides all of the advantages of prior art cellular metal raceway sections but at significantly reduced material and fabrication costs.Still another object of this invention is to provide an improved electrical wiring distribution floor structure wherein access to the wiring is provided from the space above and the space below the floor structure.The present invention constitutes an improvement over the cellular metal raceway section described and claimed in U.S.patent 3,592,956.The present invention provides a metal raceway section for use in concrete structures, particularly fill on slab and fill on grade installations. Broadly, the present metal raceway section comprises a corrugated element having alternating lengthwise troughs and lengthwise flutes. First capping means is provided which encloses a first of the lengthwise troughs to provide a first wiring passageway.Second capping means is provided which encloses a first of the lengthwise flutes to provide a second wiring passageway.Others of the lengthwise flutes comprise passageway forming lengthwise flutes adapted to cooperate with the upper surface presented by a substructure supporting the raceway section to form additional wiring passageways.In one preferred embodiment, the corrugated element presents alternating coplanar crests and coplanar valleys connected by inclined webs which cooperate to provide two lengthwise flutes and an intermediate lengthwise trough. When the capping means are installed, the first wiring passageway is positioned immediately between the second wiring passageway and the passageway forming lengthwise flute and is separated therefrom by common webs.The present invention also provides an improved electrical wiring distributing floor structure wherein the present metal raceway section is embedded between a substructure and a covering layer of concrete. The substructure may comprise, for example, a structural. slab or a compacted layer of stone, earth or sand covered by a vapor barrier. The passageway forming flutes of the present raceway section cooperate with the upper surface presented by the substructure.to form additional wiring passageways. Suitable outlet fittings may be provided at selected locations in the floor structure for gaining access to the wiring passageways from the space above the floor.The present metal raceway section may also be employed in the concrete floors of a multi story building. In this instance the substructure comprises a structural slab.Suitable outlet fittings may also be provided in the substructure for gaining access to the wiring passageways from the space below the floor. Such outlet fittings normally but not exclusively communicate with those passageways which convey power wiring and or signal and special services wiring.The cost of shipping the present raceway sections to the job site is significantly less than that of cellular raceway sections of the prior art. For example, the several distinct elements which constitute the present raceway section may be separately packaged in nested relation with others of the same element for shipping compaction. Hence packages of the elements of tha pr esent raceway section contain more pounds of metal per unit volume than do packages of prior art cellular raceway section. This should be evident since the cellular raceway sections of the prior art are not nestable to the same degree as the elements of the present raceway section.In drawings which illustrate embodiments of the invention,FIGURE 1 is an exploded perspective view of a preferred embodiment of the metal raceway section of this invention FIGURE 2 is a cross sectional view taken substantially along the line 2 2 of FIGURE 1 FIGURE 3 is a cross sectional view taken substantially along the line 3 3 of FIGURE 1 FIGURE 4 is a perspective view of a floor structure in corporating the metal raceway section of FIGURE 1 FIGURE 5 is a transverse sectional view of a concrete floor structure incorporating an alternative embodiment of the metal raceway section of this invention FIGURE 6 is a perspective view of a two pour concrete floor structure incorporating the metal raceway section of this invention andFIGURE 7 is a cross sectional view taken along the line 7 7 of FIGURE 6.FIGURE 1 illustrates a metal raceway section 10 assembled from a corrugated element 11 and first and second capping means 12, 13. The corrugated element 11 may be formed from metal coated steel, such as galvanized sheet metal having a thickness of, for example, 20 gauge. The corrugated element 11 presents alternating crests 14 and valleys 15, including an intermediate valley 15a and lateral valleys 15b, connected by inclined webs 16. In the preferred embodiment, the corrugated element 11 presents first and second spaced apart lengthwise flutes 17a, 17b, each of which is defined by a crest 14 and the inclined webs 16 connected thereto and also presents an intermediate lengthwise trough 18 defined by the intermediate valley 15a and the inclined web 16 connected thereto.The arrangement is such that the lengthwise trough 18 is separated from the first lengthwise flute 17a and the second lengthwise flute 17b by common inclined webs 16.In accordance with the present invention, the first or upper capping means 12 is adapted to enclose the intermediate lengthwise trough 18 to provide a first wiring passageway 19 FIGURE 4 . The second or lower capping means 13 is adapted to enclose the first lengthwise flute 17a and cooperate therewith to provide a second wiring passageway 20. Further in accordance with the present invention, the second lengthwise flute 17b FIGURE 3 constitutes a passageway forming flute. As shown in FIGURE 4, the metal raceway section 10 overlies a substructure 21 which may comprise a structural slab 22 or compacted stone, earth or sand 23 covered by a vapor barrier 24. The substructure 21 presents an upper surface 25 which may comprise either the upper surface of the structural slab 22 or the upper surface of the vapor barrier 24. The passageway forming flute 17b cooperates with the upper surface 25 to provide an additional or third wiring passageway 26.A layer of concrete 27 is provided over the substructure 21 and the metal raceway section 10 to complete the concrete floor structure 28. It will be observed in FIGURE 4 that a suitable floor outlet 29 communicating with the first wiring passageway 19 is provided for introducing power, telephone and signal or special services wiring 30, 31, 32, respectively, to the space above the floor structure 28. In the preferred arrangement, the power wiring 30 preferably is distributed through the second wiring passageway 20 thereby satisfying the building code requirement that high voltage 50 volts or greater power wiring be distributed through a totally enclosed metal conduit.The telephone wiring 31 preferably is conveyed through the first wiring passageway 19 since the first wiring passageway 19 is readily accessible and provides adequate space for Amphenol connectors. The signal or special services wiring 32 may be distributed through the third wiring passageway.Referring to FIGURES 1 and 2, the first capping means 12 may be formed from sheet metal having a thickness equivalent to that of the corrugated element 11. The first capping means 12 comprises a central web 33 having depending flanges 34 along the opposite longitudinal edges thereof. The central web 33 may be provided with stiffening elements 54 FIGURE 1 of any suitable pattern, either in the form of embossments as illustrated in FIGURE 1 or indentations. It will be observed in FIGURE 2 that the central web 33 is substantially flush with upper surfaces 14a only one illustrated of the crests 14 and that the depending flanges 34 only one visible engages the inclined web 16. The first capping means 12 may be secured to the corrugated element 11 by a suitable agent, such as à spot weld 45 shown in FIGURE 2.Referring to FIGURES 1 and 3, the second or lower capping means 13 may be formed from sheet metal having a thickness equivalent to that of the corrugated element 11. The lower capping means 13 comprises a central web 35 having upstanding walls 36 on opposite sides thereof, which terminate in outwardly extending ribs 37. When installed FIGURE 3 , each of the ribs 37 engages a groove 38 presented by a rib 39 which is formed in the inclined web 16. Preferably the central web 35 is not disposed below the lower faces 15c of the adjacent valleys 15. Instead the lower face 35a of the central web 35 preferably is substantially flush with the lower faces 15c of the adjacent valleys 15. In this position, the valleys 15 are in flush engagement with the upper surface 25 of the substructure 21 FIGURE 4 and the crosssectional area of the second wiring passageway 20 FIGURE 4 is maximized.The upstanding sidewalls 36 preferably are splayed outwardly compare the dotted outline and the full line positions of the sidewalls 36 in FIGURE 3. When the second capping means 13 is installed, the sidewalls 36 and ribs 37 tend to return to their original outwardly splayed positions and are thereby urged outwardly into firm engagement with the corrugated element 11. This arrangement provides good electrical contact between the first capping means 13 and the corrugated element 11 thereby providing electrical grounding continuity between the two elements.If desired, the second capping means 13 may be secured to the corrugated element 11 by a suitable agent, such as a spot weld not illustrated .The present metal raceway section may provide plural passageway forming flutes. For example, FIGURE 5 illustrates a concrete floor structure 40 incorporating a metal raceway section 41.
