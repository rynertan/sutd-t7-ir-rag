# Digital data recording and reproducing devices.

## Abstract
In a digital data recording and reproducing device, an operation of error detection is perlormed by circuits 51, 52 with respect to data with weighting provided with a code word dissolution of M bits in upper m₁ bits of the most significant bit side of great weighting and lower m₂ bits of the least significant side of small weighting. Error conceal ment 53 is carried out for each of these error detections. When reproducing data at a different tape speed from that at the time of recording, the operation of the circuit 52 for detecting an error in lower m₂ bits is inhibited, and the reference of judgement of an error in the data is altered.
