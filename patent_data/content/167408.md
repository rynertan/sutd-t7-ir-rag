# Drive circuit for color liquid crystal display device.

## Abstract
A color liquid crystal display device which comprises picture element electrodes arranged in a matrix that is made up of the intersecting points of row electrodes and column electrodes, a 1st circuit board with switching elements that are connected to these picture element electrodes, a 2nd circuit board with opposing electrodes, a liquid crystal layer that is inserted in between the said 1st and 2nd circuit boards, a color filter with a specific pattern in between the said 1st and 2nd circuit boards, and a column electrode drive circuit that applies voltage corresponding to color arrange ment of the color filter and the density of the display to the said column electrode. The column electrode drive circuit includes a sampling circuit which samples the momentary voltage corresponding to the display picture element out of the display signals that are input.
