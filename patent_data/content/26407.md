# Power tightening tool.

## Abstract
An improved power tool 10 is utilized to tighten a con nection between internally and externally threaded fastener elements. The power tool 10 includes a motor 14 which drives a socket 24 which engages the internally threaded fastener element, such as a nut. A retainer rod 44 extends through a central passage 50 in a socket drive member 28 to engage an exposed end of an externally threaded member, such as a bolt. An assembly 56 is provided to hold the retainer rod 44 against rotation with the socket 24 and to apply an axially directed force to the retainer rod 44 to urge it into engagement with the bolt. This assembly 56 includes a piston 68 which is releasably connected with the retainer rod 44 and is spring biased toward one end of a chamber 66 . As the nut is tightened onto the bolt, the piston 68 is retracted into the chamber 66 against the influence of the spring 72 . The connection 102 which secures the piston 68 to the retainer rod 44 is releasable to enable the retainer rod 44 to be moved axially relative to the piston 68 to vary the extent to which it projects into the socket 24 . The piston 68 and piston chamber 66 have polygonal cross sectional config urations so that the side surfaces of the chamber 66 hold the piston 68 and retainer rod 44 against rotational movement relative to the casing 12 of the power tool 10 .
