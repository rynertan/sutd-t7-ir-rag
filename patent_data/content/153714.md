# DISINTEGRATION ASSISTANT FOR CASTING MOLDS

## Abstract
A disintegration assistant is added to a molding compo sition made up of foundry sand and a binder whose major part is a condensation reactive compound or resin having methylol groups in a molecule. The molding composition is formed into a mold and a core by solidifying the resin so that indivisual grains of the foundry sand are bound each other. The disintegration assistant is mainly made of calcium hydroxide, calcium carbonate, barium hydroxide and or barium carbonate, thereby promoting the heat deterioration of the resin to improve the disintegration characteristics of the mold and the core.
