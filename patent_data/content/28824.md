# Method for controlling the temperature differential across a reaction zone in the manufacture of methyl t butyl ether.

## Abstract
Control of the temperature rise across a reactor 11 where a portion of the product stream 21,24 flowing from the reactor is recycled and mixed 14 with the feed flowing to the reactor is accomplished by controlling the flow rate of the recycle stream 27 to thus control the concentration of the reactants flowing to the reactor in such a manner that a desired temperature differential across the reactor is obtained. The inlet temperature to the reactor is controlled by manipulating the temperature of the recycle stream 27 to thus maintain the inlet temperature to the reactor at some desired temperature. Ratio control is utilized to maintain a desired ratio of reactants flowing to the reactor if more than one reactant is flowing to the reactor.
