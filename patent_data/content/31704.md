# Improvements in or relating to apparatus for a reative plasma process.

## Abstract
The quality of a plasma etching process is improved by withdrawing a small current from the plasma which causes the reaction to produce a uniform, controllable self bias on a work piece placed on one plasma energizing electrode. A DC poten tial supporting the current may be applied by means of a probe 26 positioned in the plasma or to one of the plasma energiz ing electrodes.
