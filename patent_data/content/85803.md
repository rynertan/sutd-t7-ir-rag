# A method of improving cold flow of fuel oils.

## Abstract
Cold flow of fuel oils is improved by adding esters of nitrogen containing compounds having polyhydroxyl groups with linear saturated fatty acids or a combination of said esters and polymers of one or more monomers selected from the group consisting of olefines, alkyl esters of ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids and vinyl esters of saturated fatty acids to fuel oils.
