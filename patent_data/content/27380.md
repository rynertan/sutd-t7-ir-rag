## Description
IMPROVED METHOD OF PREPARING A TIETA.L COtDTAINING ZEOLITE CATALYST BACYxGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention This invention relates to an improved method for preparing a metal containing zeolite catalyst, such as a dewaxing catalyst composite of the palladium zeolite alunina type.Description of the Prior Art Zeolitic materials, both natural and synthetic, have been demonstrated in the past to have catalytic properties for various types of hydrocarbon conversions.Certain zeolitic materials are ordered, porous crystalline aluminosilicates having a definite crystalline structure, as determined by X ray diffraction, within which there are a large number of smaller cavities which may be interconnected by a number of still smaller channels or pores. These cavities and pores are precisely uniform in size within a specific zeolitic material. Since the dimensions of these pores are such as to accept for adsorption molecules of certain dimensions while rejecting those of larger dimensions, these materials have come to be known as molecular sieves and are utilized in a variety of ways to take advantage of these properties. Such molecular sieves, both natural and synthetic, include a wide variety of positive ion containing crystalline aluninosilicates. These aluminosilicates can be described as a rigid three dimensional framework of SiO4 andAl04 in which the tetrahedra are cross linked by the sharing of oxygen atoms whereby the ratio of the total aluminum and silicon atoms to oxygen atoms is 1 2. The electrovalence of the tetrahedra containing aluminum is balanced by the inclusion in the crystal of a cation, for example, an alkali metal or an alkaline earth metal cation. This can be expressed wherein the ratio of aluminum to the number of various cations, such as Cay2, Sr 2, Na, K or Li is equal to unity.One type of cation may be exchanged either entirelyor partially by another type of cation utilizing ion exchange techniques in a conventional manner. By means of such cation exchange, it has been possible to vary the properties of a given aluminosilicate by suitable selection of the cation. The spaces between the tetrahedra are occupied by molecules of water prior to dehydration. Prior art techniques have resulted in the formation of a great variety of synthetic aluminosilicates.These aluminosilicates have come to be designated by letter or other convenient symbols, as illustrated by zeolite A U.S. Patent 2,882,243 , zeolite X U.S. Patent 2,882,244 , zeolite Y U.S. Patent 3,130,007 , zeolite ZK 5 U.S. Patent 3,247,195 zeolite ZK 4 U.S. Patent 3,314,752 , zeoliteZSM 5 U.S. Patent 3,702,886 , zeolite ZSM 11 U.S. Patent 3,709,979 , zeolite ZSM 12 U.S. Patent 3,832,449 , zeoliteZSM 35 U.S. Patent 4,016,245 and zeolite ZSM 23 U.S.Patent 4,076,842 , merely to name a few. In the case of 2nt catalysts, it is desired to incorporate the zeolite with another material resistant to the temperatures and other ccnditions employed in organic conversion processes. Suchm3terials include active and inactive materials as well as inorganic materials such as clays, silica and or metal oxides. Inactive materials suitably serve as diluents to control the amount of conversion in a given process so that products can be obtained economically and orderly without employing other means for controlling the rate of reaction. Binders useful for compositing with the ZSM 5 type catalyst herein also include inorganic oxides, notably alumina, which is particularly preferred. In addition to the foregoing materials, the zeolite catalyst can be composited with a porous matrix material such as silica alumina, silica magnesia, silica zirconia, silica thoria, silica beryllia, silica titania as well as ternary composizions such as silica alumina thoria, silica alwnina zirconia, silica alumina magnesia and silica magnes ia zirconia. The relative proportions of finely divided crystalline zeolite and inorganic oxide matrix vary widely with the crystalline zeolite content ranging from about 1 to about 90 percent by weight and more usually, in the range of about 2 to about 50 percent by weight of the composite. It is known to treat gas oil fractions, i.e.petroleum fractions having an initial boiling point of at least about 3300F, so as to selectively remove paraffinic hydrocarbons therefrom. This technique is desirable in order to permit many of these fractions to meet a pour point standard. In particular, many light gas oil fractions, that is, those which are used for No. 2 fuel home heating oil and or Diesel fuel, have pour points which are too high to permit their intended use. A typical pour point specification is 00F whereas it is not uncommon for such gas oil fractions to have untreated pour points of 500F or higher. Patents have issued on improved hydrodewaxing processes and catalysts, including U.S. Patent No. 3,700,585 which discloses and claims such process using a ZSM 5 type zeolite catalyst. U.S. Patent 3,894,938 is based upon the discovery that in typical refinery operations where gas oils are subjected to all of dewaxing, desulfurizing and denitrogenating, the operation is improved and rendered more efficient if catalytic hydrodewaxing, using the ZSM 5 type and related zeolite catalysts is followed by a hydrodesulfurization treatment rather than being preceded by such treatment. Operating in the mode set forth in U.S. Patent 3,894,938 has permitted much more efficient catalyst use and, in cooperation with efficient heating and cooling sequences, is responsible for orders of magnitude increases in catalyst life between regenerations. Even with these improved efficiencies of operating, the hydrodewaxing catalyst cycle life is still less than the cycle life of the following hydrodesulfurization catalyst. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In accord with the present invention there has now been discovered an improved method of preparing a catalyst composite, e.g., a hydrodewaxing catalyst, which comprises adding a Group uIIIa metal of the Periodic Table of Elements in aqueous, or non aqueous, solution to a dried low alkali or alkaline earth content zeolite starting material with mixing to provide the desired metal content, then adding a binder and water in amount sufficient to produce an extrudable composite mass, then extruding, drying and calcining the resultant composite catalyst. Although this method is particularly useful for preparing dewaxing catalyst, it can be employed to make any metal containing zeolite catalyst composite using, but not limited to zeolite X, Y, ZK 5, ZZ 4, ZSM 5, ZSM 11, ZSM 12, ZSM 23, and ZSM 35. The binder can be any one of, but not As defined by the National Bureau of Standards. limited to, naturally occurring clays, e.g. montmorillonite and kaolin families, inorganic oxides, e.g. alumina, silica alumina, silica zirconia, silica alumina zirconia and the like, and combinations thereof. The binder can be present in amount between about 5 and 997. wt. with respect to the whole, preferably between about 5 and 607. wt., and more preferalby between about 20 and 50Z wt. The Group VIIIA metal can be present in amounts of at least 0.01 wt., with respect to the zeolite. The upper limit of metal content within practical economic considerations, when using palladium for example, will be governed by the pore volume of the zeolite and the solubility of the metal salt employed. The alkali e.g. Na or alkaline earth e.g. Ca metal is critical in that it must be present in low amounts e.g. Example 1, 0.02 wt. Na . It must also be present in amount no more than about 0.1Z wt.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF TRE DRAWING Figure 1 is a flow sheet showing the improved process in diagrammatic form, described in detail in Example 1 below. Figure 2 is a comparison plot of the results obtained in catalytic dewaxing no arab light crude oil using the products of Examples 1 and 2. Representative ion exchange techniques are disclosed in a wide variety of patents including U.S.Patents 3,140,249 3,140,251 and 3,140,253. The preferred procedure for preparing 2 Pd ZSM 5 Al203 composite catalyst comprises the following steps 1 preparing the low sodiun species of ZSM 5 by known procedures and washing e.g. U.S. Patent 3,271,418 to name one 2 drying 3 while mixing in a muller, adding sufficientPd containing solution no free water to the zeolite to provide the desired Pd content with with continued mixing, adding the Al203 powder and sufficient water to produce an extrudable mass 5 extruding 6 drying and 7 calcining. The foregoing preferred procedure of preparing aPd ZSM 5 A1203 composite catalyst may also be used in the preparation of bound catalysts containing other Group VIIIA metals, as well as for other zeolites. Table 1 immediately set forth hereinbelow, compares the step wise preparation of conventional Ni ZSM 5 alumina bound catalyst and the invention method Pd ZSM 5 alumina bound catalyst, side by side.

The invention has several advantages in that 1 it would avoid a chromatographic effect when contacting a bed of ZSM 5 A1203 extrudate with a flowing Pd solution, 2 it would locate all of the Pd on the zeolite, and 3 it would provide 100to utilization of the Pd. Moreover, the advantages gained by operating in accord with the invention are extremely important in our energy and metal conservation programs. By the method of the invention there is a saving on energy, less amounts of metals have to be used, and pollution is reduced.Thus, there is acheved a conservation of energy, conservation of water and scarce metals, and a reduction of pollutants entering our environment. Catalyst made by the procedures described hereinabove showed usefulness in hydrodewaxing of distillates and lube oils. Lube hydrodewaxing tests with the present catalyst, processing either a heavy neutral waxy raffinate or a transformer oil raffinate, showed significantly less catalyst aging than with commercial NiZSM 5 catalyst. In order to more fully illustrate the nature of the invention and the manner of practicing the same, the following examples are presented.EXAMPLE 1Preparation of 65 wt. ff Pd ZSM 5 0.6 wt. ff Pd 35 wt. Al203 The procedure involved drying a portion of washed low sodium 0.02 wt ZSM 5 wet cake containing 1180 g of solids, mulling it to a powder in a pan type mixer, adding 7.1 g palladium as tetrammine palladium II chloride solution, and then blending in 636 g A alumina monohydrate and water for extrusion. The extrudate was dried at 145OF to develop strength for handling and again at 275 3000F for removing the bulk of the moisture. It was then calcined in nitrogen to remove the organics present in the ZSM 5 and finally in air. See Figure 1 flow sheet for details of the procedure of this example.Although a rather cumbersome heating procedure was used in this example, it is to be understood that conventional calcination will work just as well. Properties of the catalyst are shown below TABLE II Properties of Pd ZSM 5 Catalyst of Example 1Chemical Analysis, wt Pd 0.36 Cl 0.36Density, g cc Packed 0.54 Particle 0.89 Real 2.70Surface Area, m2 g 346Pore Volume, cc g o 0.75Average Pore Diameter, A 87Pore Vol Distr., 7, in Pores of C 0 30 A 20 30 50 10 50 80 14 80 100 4 100 150 8 150 200 4 200 300 4 300 36 EXAMPLE 2Preparation of 0.57. Pd ZSM 5 binder free catalyst A portion of precalcined NH4 ZSM 5 was calcined in air and then re ammoniated.Thereafter, the product was palladium exchanged and dried at 3000F, calcined in air, and hydrogen treated at 10000F. The products of Examples 1 and 2, respectively, were tested in the catalytic dewaxing of a 100 SUS light neutral distillate derived from Arab Light crude oil. The distillate had a boiling range of 650 8250F and a pour point of 750F. Operating conditions were a pressure of 500 psi, liquid hourly space velocity of 2.0, H2 ciculation rate of 2500 SCF B, 5500F start of cycle reactor temperature. The target pour point was 0 F. Figure 2 shows a plot of the results obtained. As can be seen the invention catalyst wtn the binder Example 1 was better than the previous best laboratory Pd catalyst without binder Example .2 . Based on the first 50 days of on stream comparison there was a showing of 1 higher initial activity 2 lower initial aging rate. ExAMPLE 3 This catalyst was prepared in the same manner asExample 1, except that it contained no Cl . It was prepared with Pd NH3 4 N03 2 instead of Pd NH3 4C12. EXAMPLE 4 This catalyst was similarly prepared as in Example 1, except that Ni N03 2 was used instead of the Pd NH3 4Cl2. Conventional calcination in a muffle furnace was employed on the extruded product. In an n dodecane screening test of the catalysts produced by the methods of Examples 1 and 3, using Ni ZSM 5 alumina catalyst for comparison, the initial activities of the Example 1 catalyst and the Example 3 catalyst were almost the same. After 26 1 2 hours on stream LHSV, Her 1 79 both catalysts showed similar activities.Both also exhibited almost identical selectivity characteristics. Conversion of n dodecane was 66.2 and 61.6, respectively whereas the comparison catalyst commerical Ni ZSM 5 alumina catalyst showed 38.2S at 6.8 hrs. v.s. 70.1 and 56.6, respectively, for the catalysts ofExamples 1 and 3 for the same time on stream.
