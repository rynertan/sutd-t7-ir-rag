# Arrangement for applying a ringing voltage to a subscriber s line.

## Abstract
When electronic circuits are used for applying a conven tional ringing voltage which has been superimposed on the conventional supply voltage, then these circuits require a high supply voltage. According to the invention an a.c. voltage is used of which that portion of each period in which the polarity is positive differs from the portion in which the polarity is negative. This a.c. voltage has a DC component by means of which the condition of the subscriber s loop can be detected. The peak peak value of the ringing voltage may be twice the maximum permissible voltage swing of a wire of the sub scriber s line, which is an optimum.
