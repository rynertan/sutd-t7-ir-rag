# Improved clip for a fluid coupling.

## Abstract
This disclosure relates to a fluid coupling including a nipple, an adapter sleeve, and a U Shaped clip for fastening the nipple and the sleeve together. The nipple has an annular rectangular shaped groove therein and the sleeve has two circular bores therethrough. The inner part of the clip that engages the groove has a generally rectangular shape to match the groove, and the outer part of the clip is curved to match the curvature of the bores. The sides of the clip are treated to improve their resistance to deformation and stress failure.
