# Process for the preparation of resinous compounds, compounds produced thereby and their use in thermosetting coating compositions.

## Abstract
Carboxyl containing resinous compounds, suitable for making water dilutable thermosetting coating compositions after at least partial neutralization with a base, are prepared by a process wherein a non acidic hydroxyl containing resinous intermediate prepared by reacting at a temperature in the range 120 to 180 C in the presence of an esterification catalyst in one or more steps a a diglycidyl ether of a dihydric phenol having an epoxy molar mass not exceeding 1100 with b a monofunctional phenol, and c dimerized unsaturated fatty acids in an epoxy phenolic or acidic equivalent ratio of a , b and c from x 2 x 2 to x 0.1 2 x 2 , wherein x is at least 4 for a diglycidyl ether having an epoxy molar mass from 400 to 1100 and x is at least 6 for a diglycidyl ether having an epoxy molar mass below 400, is reacted at a temperature not higher than 150 C with a carboxylic acid anhydride in an amount to produce a half ester having an acid value in the range 15 to 80 mg KOH g. Such resinous compounds when at least partially neutralized with a base and combined with a cross linking compound are suitable for use in electrodeposition.
