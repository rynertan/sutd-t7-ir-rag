# SYNCHRONOUS ELECTRIC ROTARY MACHINE.

## Abstract
A synchronous electric rotary machine with a layer stator core 21 which consists of a plurality of thin, axially laminated plates. The stator core constitutes a part of a shell of the synchronous electric rotary machine. A winding 23 is wound around the stator core. A pair of brackets 24 , 25 are attached to both ends of the stator core. A rotor assem bly 29 is supported rotatably with respect to the brackets via bearing members provided in the brackets. The brackets and stator core are fixed firmly by tightening them axially by a plurality of tightening members 26 . The stator core is provided therein with at least two rods 31 of the same length. Each rod extends through the stator core in the axial direction thereof. When the stator core has been contracted to a predetermined length, both end surfaces thereof engage with the brackets to limit the distance between the brackets.
