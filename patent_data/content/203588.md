## Description
PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF DEUTERATED ACRYLIC ACID OR DEUTERATED METHACRYLIC ACIDTECHNICAL FIELD This invention relates to a process for the production of deuterated acrylic acid or deuterated methacrylic acid.PRIOR ART Although methods for the production of deuterated methacrylic acid have been hardly known, a method for the production of deuterated methyl methacrylate via deuterated acetone cyanohydrin has been proposed by the Journal ofPolymer Science 62, S95 1962 . Thus, method may be thought in which deuterated methacrylic acid is obtained by the hydrolysis of deuterated methacrylamide which is an intermediate in the method. The method consists of preparing deuterated acetone cyanohydrin from deuterated acetone and hydrocyanic acid, treating this with sulfuric acid to form the sulfate of methacrylamide, then hydrolyzing this sulfate with heavy water to give deuterated methacrylic acid. However in this method, the use of deuterated starting materials such as deuterated acetone and heavy water has proven economically unsatisfactory because of the large of reaction steps involved.Further, as the related prior art, W.J.S. Lockley has set forth Regioselective Deuteration of Aromatic and a,ss unsaturated carboxylic acid in Tetrahedron Letters Vol. 23, 3819 3822 1982 and also Regioselective Hydrogen Isotope ExchangeLabelling of Aromatic and a, Unsaturated Acids in Synthesis and Application of Isotopically LabelledCompounds. Proceedings of an International Symposium 1982 on pages 427 428 which was published in 1983.Particularly, concerning alpha ,ss unsaturated carboxylic acids, it is disclosed there that 8 deuterated a,8 unsaturated carboxylic acids can be obtained using rhodium III chloride as a catalyst. In said references, however, the selective deuterium substitution on the position of hydrogen attached to Carbon of double bond is characterized, and it is merely mentioned there that polysubstitution reaction will very slightly occur only in case of crotonic acid and cinnamic acid, but no MAA is referred to there. However, the present invention aims at substitution of hydrogens as many as possible in AA or MAA, with deuteriums, which may be attained effectively and economically in accordance with the method of the present invention.For this reason, an improved method involving fewer steps has been sought. SUIYMARY OF THE INVENTION After extensive research on efficient and practical methods for the production of deuterated methacrylic acid, we discovered a novel manufacturing process involving the direct substitution of hydrogens in methacrylic acid with deuterium, which led us ultimately to the present invention. According to the present invention, there is provided a process for the manufacture of deuterated acrylic acid or deuterated methacrylic acid comprising the substitution of deuterium for hydrogens in acrylic acid or methacrylic acid in the presence of a catalyst.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION As the deuterium source for the substitution of deuteriums for hydrogens in acrylic acid cr methacrylic acid, heavy water or mixture of heavy water and deuterium gas may be employed. At least a stoichiometric amount of deuterium with respect to the acrylic acid or methacrylic acid must be present within the reaction system. Referring to the catalyst, compounds involving palladium, ruthenium, iridium and or platinum, for example hexachloroiridic acid, tetrakis triphenylphosphine palladium, potassium bromoplatinate, potassium pentachlororuthenate, palladium nitrate, potassium hexahydroxoplatinate and the like are preferred. A mixture of two or more thereof may also be employed. Referring to another catalyst, compounds invoving rhodium element and other platinum group elements may be employed. Preferably, rhodium metal may be supported on a suitable carrier such as active carbon or the like. As compounds involving rhodium element, sodium hexachlororhodate, chlorotris triphenylphosphine rhodium, rhodium chloride and the like are preferred. As compounds involving such platinum group element, there are listed platinum, iridium, palladium, ruthenium or osumium per se and nitrate, chloride, complex compounds or the like thereof, and more concretely, hexachloroiridic acid, tetrakis triphenylphosphine palladium, potassium bromoplatinate, palladium nitrate, potassium hexahydroxoplatinate, potassium tetrachloroplatinate or the like is preferred.Where necessary, these compounds may also be supported on a suitable carrier such as alumina, silica, silicaalumina, diatomaceous earth, active carbon, or the like. The reaction may be conducted either in a gaseous phase or a liquid phase, and under the application of pressure. To inhibit polymerization during the reaction, a suitable polymerization inhibitor such as phenothiazine, hydroquinone or the like may be added as required.Polymerization may also be inhibited by allowing a small amount of oxygen to be present in the reaction mixture. In the case of carrying out the present invention, acrylic acid or methacrylic acid is allowed to react with the deuterium source, for example heavy water to substitute deuteriums for hydrogens in acrylic acid or methacrylic acid. Where necessary, the present reaction is carried out in the presence of a solvent which is stable at the reaction temperature, for example dimethylacetamide, dimethylformamide or the like, and at from room temperature to 3000C, but a temperature from 60 to 2000C is preferable, especially preferable from 80 to 1500C, from the standpoint of reaction rate as well as the inhibition of side reactions and polymerization. The reaction time is normally from 20 minutes to 100 hours. The resulting deuterated acrylic acid or deuterated methacrylic acid which can be obtained in accordance with the present invention may be subject to the esterification reaction with alcohol, for example, methylalcohol or deuterated methylalcohol to obtain deuterated methyl acrylate or deuterated methyl methacrylate, respectively, which are used as materials of low light loss optical plastic fibers. Optical plastic fibers made of undeuterated methylmethacrylate or undeuterated methyl acrylate are significantly affected by the vibration absorption of the C H bonds at the light transmission wavelength, so that it is difficult to make light loss fibers. However, the conversion of the C H bonds to C D bonds by the deuteration removes the influence of C H vibration absorption, thereby improving the light transmission ability of fibers. By this reason, the best results may be attained in case that all theC H bonds have been converted to the C D bonds, but even in case of a partial deuteration, the effects will be exerted in response to a degree of deuteration.PREFERRED EMBODIZENTS OF THE INVENTION In the following Examples, all references to parts signify parts by weight.
