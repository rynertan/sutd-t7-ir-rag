# Contra angle head for dental handpieces.

## Abstract
A contra angle head for a dental handpiece comprises a rigid tubular housing 10 which provides separate enclosures for a drive shaft 12 and a dental tool that are rotatable on axes that are angularly related. A wall 22 separating the two enclosures provides bearing support for tool driving gears 30,32 in one of the enclosures and connection to a driving shaft 12 in the other 11 . A latch member 40 envelops the housing and covers it smoothly. The latch member 40 is movable on the longitudinal axis of the tubular housing for controlling access to the enclosure for a dental tool.
