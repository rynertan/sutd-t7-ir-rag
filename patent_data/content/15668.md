# Digestible polyamino acids, method for preparing them and food fortified with the digestible polyamino acids.

## Abstract
Polyamino acids having a degree of polymerization of from 3 to about 60 have been found to be waterinso luble yet digestible in the presence of certain common pro teolytic enzymes. Unlike the higher molecular weight poly amino acids, the polyamino acid products of this invention are useful for nutritional fortification of food materials.
