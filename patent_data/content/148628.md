# Magnetic head core and method for producing the same.

## Abstract
A magnetic head core consisting of plural core elements 16, 18 of ferrite butted and bonded together through solid solid reaction so as to form a generally annular magnetic circuit having a magnetic gap 22 . At least opposed portions of the magnetic circuit which define the magnetic gap and provide magnetic medium contacting surfaces are formed of a single crystal of ferrite. At least one 16 of the plural core elements is originally an at least partially monocrystalline block of ferrite including a monocrystalline portion 15 consisting of a ferrite single crystal, and at least one of the opposed portions defining the magnetic gap is monocrystallized as a result of growth of the ferrite single crystal of the monocrystalline portion toward the original ferrite polycrystal of the core elements.
