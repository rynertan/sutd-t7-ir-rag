# Method of fabricating an insulated gate type field effect transistor.

## Abstract
A method of fabricating a MOS device is disclosed, in which, after formation of a gate electrode 18 and source, drain regions 22a, 22b , conductive material films 23a, 23b, 23c are formed by selective CVD on the exposed surfaces of the gate electrode 18 and source, drain regions 22a, 22b . The conditions of the selective CVD are set such that the conductive material films 23a, 23b formed on the source and drain regions 22a, 22b partly overlay over the field insulating film 14 adjacent to and surrounding the source and drain regions 22a, 22b .
