# Crop shear control.

## Abstract
The invention relates to electronic control of a crop shear 11, 12 for trimming the head and tail of a bar 10 . The bar is scanned longitudinally by a camera 15 to monitor its pro gress towards the crop shear 11, 12 . The bar 10 is also scanned transversely by a second camera 13 connected to a processor whch analyses the shape of the bar to determine the optimum point for cropping. The method is also described for distinguishing between the outline of a bar and surface an omalies such as may be caused by water or scale on the bar 10 .
