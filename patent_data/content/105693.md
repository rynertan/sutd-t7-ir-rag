# Bipolar voltage controlled optical switch using intersecting waveguide.

## Abstract
An optical switch comprises a substrate 1, 1 , a wave guide 2, 3, 21, a pair of input 2, 3, 22, 23, and a pair of output waveguides 2, 3, 24, 25. The refractive index of a part of the waveguide 4 , 41, 42, is changed to effect switchin of a light beam from one path to another through the waveguide. The part of the waveguide the refractive index of which is changed is narrower than the remainder of the waveguide and is centrally symmetrical with respect to the waveguide.
