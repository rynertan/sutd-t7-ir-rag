# Scanning servo system for optical disc information reproducing apparatus.

## Abstract
A scanning servo system for an optical disc information reproducing apparatus includes a a light source 12 for generating a light beam 10 to scan a selected track location on an optical disc 16 wherein the information is stored as a series of pits or recesses arranged in the form of a track 24 b an objective lens 20 for applying a scanning spot 18 of the light beam to the selected track location c a transducer 26 for converting an optical signal of an image 28 of a pit or recess into an electrical signal d an actuator 58 or 72 for driving the objective lens in response to the electric signal in a direction vertically or radially relative to the optical disc, thereby causing the scanning spot to scan the selected track location accurately, the actuator being variable as regards its response characteristics in response to the electrical signal e a circuit 44 for detecting a dropout of the information on the selected track location and generating a signal respon sive to the dropout of information f a circuit 78 for delaying the signal responsive to the dropout of information for one rotation period of the optical disc and g a circuit 32, 36 for lowering the response characteristics of the actuator in response to the signal responsive to the dropout of information through the delaying circuit.
