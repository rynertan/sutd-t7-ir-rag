# Piezoelectric resonator force transducer.

## Abstract
A force transducer devide is described which is adapted to function in a system having electrical means to cause the device to oscillate at its natural resonant frequency and means to monitor said frequency. The device comprises an intermediate resilient member 10 curved on at least one side and being capable of mechanically oscillating at a natural resonant frequency, piezoelectric transducers 13, 15 on each side of said resilient member and electrical leads 24, 26 for connecting the transducer sheets into said system. Each transducer 13, 15 comprises a film of piezoelectric resin sandwiched between two electroconductive layers 16, 18 and 20, 22 .
