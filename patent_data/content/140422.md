# Process for preparing an impact resistant thermoplastic moulding compound.

## Abstract
The invention concerns a simple, reliable and reproduc able process for preparing an impact resistant thermoplastic moulding compound based on a copolymer consisting of styrene and or Î± methyl styrene and maleic anhydride, char acterized in that the moulding compound is prepared by mixing 50 95 wt of a copolymer consisting of 1. 50 95 wt styrene and or methylstyrene 2. 50 5 wt maleic anhydride 3. 0 20 wt acrylate 4. 0 20 wt acrylonitrile with 5 50 wt rubber modified with hydroxyl groups and 0 30 wt unmodified rubber to be mixed in the presence of 0.01 10 parts by weight of a reaction accelerator, calculated on 100 parts by weight copolymer and modified rubber, at a temperature between 160 C and 290 C.
