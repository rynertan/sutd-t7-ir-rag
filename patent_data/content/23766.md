## Description
Regulating growth of plants with phenyliminothiadiazolines Description of the Invention Many chemical substances have been found to have growth regulating effects on plants. Change of shape of plants, crinkling and folding of leaves, stunting of growth, defoliation, stimulation of root growth on cuttings and other effects are frequently observed. It is usually necessary to apply growth regulating substances to plants at comparatively low rates in order to have the growth regulating effects clearly evident. At higher rates a selective kill of vegetation is usually obtained, as some species of plants are affected more than others. Growth regulants have, in fact been used more as selective herbicides than for other purposes because in many instances the growth regulating effects exhibited by these substances have no other practical utility.However, a class of growth regulant compounds has now been discovered that produces a number of useful effects, differing from one plant species to another.For example, some of these compounds promote tillering branching at the base of the plant in oats and certain other grasses and increase of fruit set, accompanied by theability to kill crabgrass by pre emergent application. Briefly, the class of growth regulant compounds has the general structural formulaEMI2.1 in which R1 is H, or one to four substituents selected from Cl, nitro, lower alkyl and lower alkoxy, Rê is H, lower alkyl, lower alkoxyalkyl, lower alkenyl, lower haloalkyl or agriculturally acceptable cation, R3is H, lower alkyl, lower alkenyl, lower alkynyl, lower haloalkyl or benzyl and 4. R is H or at least one substituent selected from 3,4 trimethylene F, C1, Br, CF3, nitro, lower dialkylamino, lower alkylcarbonyl, lower alkyl and lower alkoxy with the further provision that at least one ortho position is unsubstituted. The terms lower alkyl, lower alkoxy etc. as used above are intended to mean C1 to C5 alkyl, etc. The method of regulating growth of plants, including combating unwanted vegetation, comprises applying to the plants, either on seed, the soil or directly on the plants an effective amount of a member of the aforementioned class of compounds.Synthesis of the Growth Regulants The novel compounds of this invention may be produced by means of procedures based on the following illustrative syntheses. All temperatures are in degreesC. The thiadiazoline compounds of this invention are conveniently made by ring closure of a class of thiosemicarbazides, which may be prepared by means of a method which is illustrated in the following specific procedures. 1 Synthesis of methyl hydrogen phthalate. Methanol 300 ml was added in a single portion to 148 g 1.00 mole of phthalic anhydride and the resulting suspension was stirred and heated at reflux for 36 hours solution occurred during heating. The solvent was removed and the product was recrystallized from a mixture of ethyl acetate and hexane to afford 114.6 g of the title compound Lit. Beilstein, 9 797 mp 82.5 , 840 . 2 Synthesis of methyl phthaloyl chloride. Methyl hydrogen phthalate 110.0 g., 0.611 mole and thionyl chloride 77.4 g., 0.650 mole were mixed in 200 ml of chloroform, keeping the temperature below QO. After stirring for two hours at room temperature, the system was heated at reflux for five hours. The solvent was evaporated at reduced pressure and the crude product 120.9 g was used without further purification Lit. Beilstein, 9, 797 no constants . 3 Synthesis of l 2 carbomethoxybenzoyl 2methyl 4 phenyl 3 thiosemicarbazide. A solution of 45.3 g 0.25 mole of 2 methyl 4phenyl 3 thiosemicarbazide and 19.8 g 0.25 mole of pyridine in 800 ml of l,2 dimethoxyethane was stirred at room temperature while 49.8 g 0.25 mole of methyl phthaloyl chloride in 100 ml of 1,2 dimethoxyethane was added dropwise over a period of two hours. The resulting reaction mixture was stirred for 16 hours at room temperature. At the end of this time the contents of the flask were poured into ice water. The solid which formed was collected and amounted to 73.3 g 85 the melting point was 153.5 154 . The general method of manufacturing the phenyliminothiadiazolines of this invention is the acidpromoted cyclodehydration of a compound of the formula EMI5.1 Among the acidic reagents found to be effective are concentrated sulfuric acid, trifluoroacetic anhydride and thionyl chloride and the results obtained seem to depend markedly on the nature of the substituents R2, R3 and The best general method of cyclization found thus far involves concentrated sulfuric acid and utilizes chloroform as diluent, as illustrated by the following preparation of 5 2 carboxyphenyl 2 3 fluorophenyl imino 3 methyl 1,3,4 thiadiazol 4 ine, In a 3 1., 3 neck round bottom flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer, thermometer, reflux condenser and addition funnel, and immersed in an ice bath, a solution of 84.3 g. 0.243 mols of 1 2 carboxybenzoyl 4 3 fluorophenyl 2 methyl 3 thiosemicarbazide mop. 155 70C in 1750 ml. of chloroform is stirred while 404 g. of concentrated sulfuric acid is added slowly during a 30 minute period, keeping the temperature below 250C. A clear solution, two phase system resulted after about half of the sulfuric acid had been added. The mixture was stirred an additional 2 hours at room temperature and carefully poured into a mixture of 8C0 ml. of concentrated ammonium hydroxide and 2 kg. of ice. The resulting two phase system was stirred 15 minutes, and separated The organic phase was discarded and the aqueous phase was stirred and cooled to 200C., and acidified to pH3 with 370 ml. of glacial acetic acid, which produced a solid precipitate.The slurry was stirred for 30 minutes at 100C. and filtered. The filter cake was rinsed with two 300 ml. portions of cold water, reslurried with 750 ml. of cold water, collected by filtration and air dried to give 65 g. 81 yield of product nelting at 207 80C. Below are two specific procedures which are illustrative of a small scale laboratory method Preparation of 2 phenylimino 3 methyl 5 2 carboxyphenyl 1,3,4 thiadiazol 4 ine. To 25 ml. of H2SO4 was added 5 g. 0.015 mole of 1 2 carboxybenzoyl 2 methyl 4 phenyl 3 thiosemi carbazide. After stirring at room temperature for 30 minutes, crushed ice was added. The resulting acidic solution was washed with ethyl acetate, then taken to pH 8 with concentrated NH4OH. The precipitated product was collected, washed with cold water and dried to give 1.0g, MP 223 2250. Preparation of 2 phenylimino 3 methyl 5 2 carbomethoxyphenyl 1,3,4 thiadiazol 4 ine. Using the same conditions described above, 5.0g of 1 2 carbomethoxybenzoyl 2 methyl 4 phenyl 3 thio semicarbazide gave 1.3g of the desired product, MP 96 98 . Compounds which have been made by means of procedures of the type illustrated above appear in the following table. TABLE ICOMPOUNDS OF THE FORMULAEMI8.1 Compound No. R P R3 P M.P. C.

Aqueous spray formulations were prepared and the potted plants were sprayed at a spray volume of 40 gal. per acre and at application rates of 16, 4, 1 and 1 4 oz. per acre.The spray mixtures were prepared by dissolving the proper amount of growth regulator compound in 15 ml. of acetone, adding 2 ml. of a solventemulsifier mixture consisting of 60 wt. percent of a commercial polyoxyethylated vegetable oil emulsifier 96 wt. percent active ingredient, Emulphor E1 719 , 20 wt. percent xylene and 20 wt. percent deodorized kerosene, then bringing total volume up to 80 ml. by addition of a 0.156 wt. percent aqueous solution of liquid non ionic dispersant 90 wt. percent active trimethylnonyl polyethylene glycol ether, Tergitol TMN 10 .Two replicates were sprayed at all application rates. For comparative purposes, plants were also sprayed at 40 gal. acre with water. The number of seed poRls and of fruit as percentage of arithmetic mean of the numbers on untreated plants was observed within approximately three weeks after spray treatment and the results are tabulated below. The extent of growth regulatory effect on the plants was estimated on a scale of 0 to 10 and is also recorded in the following table Table 3.

It may be seen, for example, that total kills of some species of vegetation frequently occurs at application rates as high as 5 to 10 lb. per acre, whereas beneficial effects may be observed on living plants at application rates of I lb. per acre or less. The growth regulator compounds are usually applied in combination with inert carriers or diluents, as in aqueous sprays, granules and dust formulations, in accordance with established practice in the art. An aqueous spray in usually prepared by mixing a wettable powder or emulsifiable concentrate formulation of a growth regulator with a relatively large amount of water to form a dispersion. Wettable powders comprise intimate, finely divided mixtures of growth regulator compounds, inert solid carriers and surface active agents. The inert solid carrier is usually chosen from among the attapulgite clays, the kaolin clays, the montmorillonite clays, the diatomaceous earths, finely divided silica and purified silicates.Effective surfactants, which have wetting, penetrating and dispersing ability are usually present in a wettable powder formulation in proportions of from 0.5 to about 10 percent by weight. Among the surface active agents commonly used for this purpose are the sulfonated lignins, naphthalenesulfonates and condensed naphthalenesulfonates, alkylbenzenesulfonates, alkyl sulfates and non ionic surfactants such as products of condensation of ethylene oxide with alkylphenols. Emulsifiable concentrates of the growth regulator compounds comprise in each instance, a solution of growth regulator compound in a liquid carrier which is a mixture of water immiscible solvent and surfactants, including emulsifiers. Useful solvents include aromatic hydrocarbon solvents such as the xylenes, alkylnaphthalenes, petroleum distillates, terpene solvents, ether alcohols and organic ester solvents. Suitable emulsifiers, dispersing and wetting agents may be selected from the same classes of products which are employed in formulating wettable powders. In general, the growth regulator formulations desirably contain from 0.1 percent to 95 percent by weight of a compound of formula I and from 0.1 to 75 percent of a carrier or surfactant. However, direct application to plant seeds prior two planting may be accomplished in some instances by mixing powdered solid growth regulator with seed to obtain a substantially uniform coating which is very thin and comprises only one or two percent by weight or less, based on the weight of the seed.In most instances, , however, a nonphytotoxic solvent, such as methanol s employed as a carrier to facilitate the uniform istribution of growth regulator on the surface of the seer hen a compound is to be applied to the soil, as for a pra emergence application, granular formulations are sometimes more convenient than sprays. A typical granular ormation comprises the growth regulator compound disperse on an inert carrier such as coarsely ground clay, er lay which has been converted to granules by treatment of a rolling bed of the powdered material with a small amount of liquid in a granulating drum. In the usual process Dr preparing granular formulations, a solution of the active compound spray is sprayed on the granules while they ara being agitated in a suitable mixing apparatus, after w ch the granules are dried with a current of air during rtntinued agitation.
