# Final reduction gear apparatus.

## Abstract
Outside of the oil seal 8,26,33,45,54 attached to the side gear shaft position in the final reduction gear apparatus, a guide member 10,20,30,40 is installed which has an inner diameter D slightly larger than that of the main lip 9,25,34,46,55 of the oil seal 8,26,33,45,54 and has a guide surface 11,24,36,41 concentric to the main lip 9,25,34,46,55 the side gear shaft 4,21,35,44,56 is pushed along the guide surface 11,24,36,41 of said guide member 10,20,30,40 , whereby the interference between the side gear shaft 4,21,35,44,56 and the main lip 9,25,34,46,55 of the oil seal 8,26,33,45,54 can be minimized, thus preventing damage to the main lip 9,25,34,46,55 and assuring the normal function of the oil seal 8,26,33,45,54 to prevent oil leakage and the assembling of the side gear shaft 4,21,35,44,56 is facilitated through exact and easy centering of the side gear shaft 4,21,35,44,56 .
