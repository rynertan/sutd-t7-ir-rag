# An enclosure member substantially impermeable to the transmission of solvents and fuels.

## Abstract
The present application relates to enclosure members consisting essentially of solid, non aromatic polymers that have a linear carbon to carbon backbone structure and having a plurality of free hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon atoms with a permeability to wet solvents and fuels of less than 1 7, optionally less than 1 40 of the permeabi lity of untreated enclosure members having a tickness of 1 mm. Said low permeability is due to the presence of a layer of an iron phenanthroline complex on at least the in ner surface of sald enclosure members, having a portion of the hydrogen atoms replaced by sulphonic acid or sulpho nate groups.
