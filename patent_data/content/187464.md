# Leadless chip carrier adapter.

## Abstract
An adapter is described for making connection between the contact pads 16 of a LCC Leadless Chip Carrier 12 and the terminals 24 of an ordinary low cost socket 14 that normally receives the LCC and connects it to a printed circuit board 28 , while also providing connections for test equip ment to monitor the interface between the LCC and the printed circuit, or just the LCC, or just the printed circuit. The adapter includes a base element 32 which fits into the socket 14 and which has multiple pads 34 that contact the terminals 24 of the socket 14 , and a test interfacer 44 which attaches to the base element 32 and extends upwardly therefrom. The interfacer 44 has a receiver 48 for receiving a LCC 12 and has leads 42 that extend between the pads 16 of the LCC and the pads 34 of the base element 32 . The leads 42 also have portions 30 that are accessible from the outside so that test equipment can be connected to them to monitor the interface betwen the LCC and the socket which connects to the printed circuit board.
