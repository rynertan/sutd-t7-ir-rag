# Apparatus for measuring the velocity of a fluid and maintaining it constant.

## Abstract
Apparatus for maintaining the velocity of a fluid constant, and in particular for maintaining an aspirator air velocity con stant under varying atmospheric conditions. A precisely con trolled air velocity is provided by a reference air source 134 whose frequency is derived from a crystal oscillator 136 . The total air pressure from the aspirator tunnel 92 is compared with the total air pressure from the reference air source 134 using a matched thermistor pair 144, 146 to convert the pressure difference into an electrical error signal which is used to control the main air source 120 for the aspirator tunnel 92 such that the error signal is maintained at zero, thereby maintaining the air velocity in the aspirator tunnel 92 constant.
