# Method and apparatus for normalizing servo positioning signals, particularly for transducers for recording tracks.

## Abstract
Analog servo positioning signals transduced from a recorded member 10 , such as embedded servo signals 28, 30 32, 34 recorded on a disc memory or the like, which are to be compared to one another in order to derive an error signal indicative of off track position deviations, are normal ized for accurate responsive positioning changes by use of an analog to digital converter 62 reference by both a positive and a negative summation of the two analog signals and supplied with the individual analog signals as inputs, such that the digitalized output comprises a pair of digital signals, the first representative of the quotient of the first analog signal divided by the summation of the two analog signals, and the second representative of the second analog signal divided by the same summation of analog signals. The two resulting digital signals are then processed in a micro processor 68 by subtracting the second such quotient representative signal from the first, thereby providing a fully normalized digital signal representative of the deviation from true position. An analog multiplexer 66 is preferably used as a switching input to the A D converter, and the latter comprises a multiplying type A D converter.
