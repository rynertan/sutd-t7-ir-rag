# System for producing an air laid web.

## Abstract
A system for forming an air laid web of fibers and or parti cles on a moving foraminous carrier. Fibers and or particles are blended in a blender 44 , and while supported in an air stream, introduced into a distributor unit 56 . The distributor unit in cludes rotatable cylinders 66 formed with classification aper tures 68 of a predetermined shape, number, and size as spe cifically related to the types of fibers and or particles utilized. A rotatable shaft 70 with radially extending wire like mem bers 72 agitates the fibers and or particles and throws them outwardly through the apertures. Downwardly directed air flow transports the refined fibers and or particles so as to form a homogeneous, still further refined, web on the surface of a carrier 62 . A variety of adjustments and alterations can be made to the system and its components to control the compo sition and thickness of the end product, and to attain maximum capacity for any combination of fibers and or particles.
