# Separation of ortho bi alkyl substituted monocyclic aromatic isomers.

## Abstract
A process for separating the ortho isomer from a feed mixture comprising at least two bi alkyl substituted monocy clic aromatic isomers, including the ortho isomers, the isomers having from 9 to about 18 carbon atoms per molecule. The process comprises contacting, at adsorption conditions, the feed with an adsorbent comprising a crystal line aluminosilicate consisting essentially of a sodium or calcium Y type zeolite or sodium X type zeolite which selectively adsorbs the ortho isomers. The feed is removed from the adsorbent, and the ortho isomers recovered by desorption at desorption conditions with a desorbent mate rial comprising a C₈ or heavier monocyclic aromatic with a boiling point at least 5 C different than that of the feed mixture when the adsorbent is the sodium Y type zeolite, or a C₈ or lighter moncyclic aromatic when the adsorbent is a sodium X or calcium Y type zeolite. The process is particularly amenable to the employment of a simulated moving bed flow scheme.
