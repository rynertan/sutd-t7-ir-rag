# Disc brake.

## Abstract
A disc brake includes a caliper assembly 12 cooperat ing with a pair of friction elements 14, 16 to brake a rotor 10 . A pin assembly 30 supports the caliper assembly 12 and includes a bolt 34 defining an axial spacing for a sleeve 36 which engages the caliper assembly 12 via a resilient bushing 32 . The sleeve is permitted to move axially through a clearance 62 with each brake application and a spring 38 biases the sleeve and caliper to always retract through the clearance upon termination of braking.
