# Optical system for oblique viewing.

## Abstract
An optical system 10 for the oblique viewing of an object 20 includes a specific embodiment for quantitatively determing the volume of solder mounds 22 on chips 20 and wafers without the introduction of keystone distortion and anamorphosis. The optical system 10 includes means 26 for directing an image of the solder mounds 22 at an angle ϑ₃ to a diffraction grating 28 to provide a diffracted beam 30 normal to the grating 28 . The diffracted beam 30 is then processed in a conventional manner to yield the sought after information. In a preferred embodiment the directing means is an afocal lens system having a magnifica tion of one.
