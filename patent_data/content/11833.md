## Description
This invention pertains to graft copolymers and more particularly to those having acrylic acid grafted onto poly oxyalkylene compounds in the presence of tertiary butyl perbenzoate or tertiary butyl hydroperoxide. Poly oxyalkylene compounds including poly oxyethylenes , poly oxypropylenes and copolymers thereof have been used as lubricants. However such compounds when used in aqueous formulations often settle out on standing which is undesirable in process operations. Techniques for graft polymerizing ethylenically unsaturated monomers onto polymer backbones are known in the art. However the resultant. graft copolymers are often seriously contaminated with by products resulting from undesired side reactions. One common contaminant in such heterogeneous mixtures is homopolymer of the monomer used in the graft polymerization reaction. There is a need for modified poly oxyalkylene compounds which possess a combination of the original properties of the unmodified poly oxyalkylene compounds plus new physical and or chemical properties. Graft copolymers of acrylic acid and a polyalkylene oxide have been made by a method which comprises adding a solution of polyalkylene oxide and 3 to 15 by weight, based on the weight of the total charge, of acrylic acid and a solution of a catalytic amount of t butyl perbenzoate, di t butyl peroxide or t butyl hydroperoxide in polyalkylene oxide to an agitated bath of polyalkylene oxide, whereby all of said components are intimately admixed, at a temperature of about 10000 to about 160 C and maintaining said temperature until a graft copolymer of acrylic acid on polyalkylene oxide is obtained, said polyalkylene oxide having the formula R OCnH2nzOR1 a wherein R is a hydrocarbon radical containing up to 10 carbons, free of aliphatic unsaturation, and having a valence. of a, a is an integer having a value of 1 to about 4, R is a hydrogen atom or a monovalent hydrocarbon radical containing up to 6 carbons, free of aliphatic unsaturation, n has a value of 2 to. 4 inclusive, and z is an integer having a value of about 8 to about 800. The poly alkylene oxide compounds used to make the graft copolymers are known in the art. These are commonly produced by reacting an alkylene oxide or a mixture of alkylene oxides with an alcohol. Such alcohols can be monohydric or polyhydric and correspond to the formula R 0H a wherein R and a are as defined above. Such alcohols include methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol, ethylene glycol, glycerol, the monoethylether of glycerol, the dimethyl ether of glycerol, sorbitol, 1,2,6 hexanetriol, trimethyloipropane, and the like. Preferably, the poly oxyalkylene compounds used in this invention have molecular weights number average in the range to about 400 to about 35,000 and more preferably in the range to about 1500 to about 4000. Although polymerization temperatures of about 100 C to 1600C can be used, it is preferred to use temperatures in the range of about 1300C td about 150 C. Polymerization temperatures above 1600C lead to the formation of undesirable by products. Unexpectedly it was found that homogeneous graft copolymers were obtained free of homopolymerized acrylic acid by limiting the acrylic acid monomer in the polymerization reactor zone to an upper limit of 15 based on the weight of poly oxyalkylene compound charged. This freedom from undesired homopolymerization is further enhanced by charging the reactants in two separate feed streams, the first consisting of poly oxyalkylene compound and acrylic acid and the second consisting of poly oxyalkylene compound containing the free radical polymerization initiator. Efficient agitation coupled with an incremental addition of the two feed streams constitutes the most desirable technique for providing the graft copolymer free of homopolymerized acrylic acid. It was also unexpected that methacrylic acid did not graft well to the poly oxyalkylene compounds, producing an undesirable heterogeneous mixture containing homopolymer of methacrylic acid. The choice of free radical initiator is critical.Thus while t butyl perbenZoateX di t butyl peroxide or t butyl hydroperoxide afford the desired homogeneous graft copolymers, azobisisobutryonitrile does not, leading to heterogeneous mixtures. The graft copolymers of this invention can be used as lubricants for metals, paper, textiles and the like. The graft copolymerization reaction is preferably carried out in bulk without the use of an organic solvent.If desired however a solvent can be used which is nonreactive and inert to the reactants. Suitable organic solvents include aromatics, such as, benzene or tertiary butylbenzene, aliphatics, such as, heptane, hexane or octane and mixtures thereof.

The two dropping funnels were positioned to deliver their contents above the liquid level of the reaction mixture, at opposite sides of the resin kettle.Both feeds from the funnels were adjusted to drop directly into the resin kettle, not down the walls.
