# Plasticisation of neutralised sulphonated polymer with organic carbamate.

## Abstract
This invention relates to improved polymeric compositions of metal, amine and ammonium neutralized sulfonated polymers which are preferentially plasticized with an N substituted organic carbamate at a minimum critical concentration level of 1 to 75 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the neutralized polymer, wherein N substituted organic carbamate has the formula
