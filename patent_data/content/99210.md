# Mesh structure and laminate made therewith.

## Abstract
In order to produce a biaxially orientated mesh structure using a single axis draw, a plastics material starting material has parallel, side by side main zones separated by line of holes or depressions the starting material is drawn parallel to the main zones, stretching the main zones into con tinuous, orientated main strands 4 interconnected by smaller cross section strands 6 which have been formed from the zones between holes or depressions in each line, and have been orientated at right angles to the direction of drawing by the effect of the main zones decreasing in width as they were stretched. The mesh structure is suitable for cross lamination.
