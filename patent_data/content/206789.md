## Description
The present invention relates to 3,9 bis 2 3 3 tert butyl 4 hydroxy 5 methylphenyl propionyloxy 1,1 dimethylethyl 2,4,8,10 tetraoxaspiro 5 5 undecane hereinafter referred to as hydroxyphenylpropionic acid ester represented by the structural formula I having a novel crystalline structure It is well known that the hydroxyphenylpropionic acid ester I can effectively be used to prevent various kinds of synthetic resin from deterioration such as softening, embrittlement, surface cracking discoloration, etc. caused by the action of heat, light and oxygen during processing and use Japanese Patent Application Kokai Laid Open Nos. 25826 1984 and 231089 1984 as such synthetic resins, there may be mentioned polyolefins such as polyethylenes,polypropylenes, etc., styrene series synthetic resins such as polystyrenes, impact resistant polystyrenes, ABS, etc., engineering plastics such as polyacetals, polyamides, etc., and polyurethanes. Previously, we found that the ester I exists in two forms, one being a glassy substance having a melting point of about 45 The γ crystals were obtained by melting a mixture of the raw ester I with impurities present from the production reaction or ester I of improved purity obtained by purification by column chromatography, etc., and then rapidly cooling the melt without using a solvent, their melting point being from about 45 The αβ crystals were obtained by recrystallizing ester I from n hexame as described for 3,9 bis 2 3 3,5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxyphenyl propionyloxy 1,1 dimethylethyl 2,4,8,10 tetraoxaspiro 5 5 undecane of similar structural formula II in the foregoing Japanese Patent Application Kokai No. 25826 1984 The melting point of the αβ crystals was from about 104 The hydroxyphenylpropionic acid ester I takes either one of the αβ or γ crystal structure, and no other crystalline structures have been known. However, in producing these αβ and γ crystals on a commercial scale, there have been many difficult problems, and only unsatisfactory results have been obtained. For example, in the production of the αβ crystals with, particularly, n hexane as a recrystallization solvent, scaling of the recrystallization apparatus is marked, and the purification effect is low because of the small solubility difference between the ester I and impurities contained in the mixture to be purified. This recrystallization method was therefore disadvantageous for commercial scale purification. Purification of the γ crystals has not been practicable commercially. Column chromatography is effective as a purification method, but it cannot be used as a large scale commercial purification method for economic reasons. It has therefore been considered very difficult to produce the hydroxyphenylpropionic acid ester I with ease and in high purity on a commercial scale. We have now found a new crystalline hydroxyphenylpropionic acid ester I of excellent quality and completely different crystalline structure, and methods by which it can be obtained simply and economically the crystals thus obtained are of higher melting point than the αβ and γ crystals, so that they can be used more advantageously. The present invention provides hydroxyphenylpropionic acid ester represented by the structural formula I having a novel crystalline structure which shows sharp X ray diffraction peaks at angles of diffraction, 2 ϑ 4.2 The hydroxyphenylpropionic acid ester of the present invention has a novel crystalline structure hereinafter referred to as δ crystals and has a Cu K The δ crystals of the present invention can have a melting point of from about 118 The δ crystals of the present invention, because of the higher melting point than that of the αβ crystals, show improved blocking property in the drying and crushing steps subsequent to the recrystallization step. The δ crystals, surprisingly, have a lower solubility than the αβ crystals Table 2 , and their compatability with impurities produced at the same time by the production reaction is low so that the recrystallization yield is high and high purity product can be obtained easily. Further, the growth of the δ crystals is easy as compared with the αβ crystals, for which reason the δ crystals can be obtained in large size and have much improved filterability. The existence and excellent characteristics of the δ crystals of the present invention could not be forecast from the prior art. The δ crystals can easily be produced, for example, by dissolving hydroxyphenylpropionic acid ester I in For the recrystallization, either one of 1 or 2 may be used. When the recrystallization solvent 1 is used, it may be a water soluble solvent alone. However when water is mixed with such solvent the solubility can be lowered so that the temperature at which only the δ crystals are formed may be further increased, as a result of which the growth of the crystals may be promoted and the filter ability thereof can be improved. Such mixing with water causes a reduction in the solubility to increase the crystallization yield, and is useful in increasing safety against ignition and explosion. Consequently, such mixing with water is preferred industrially. The amount of water to be mixed varies depending upon the particular kind of solvent, but it is generally not more than 3 times by weight based on the water soluble solvent. When the amount of water exceeds 3 times by weight, there is a tendency for the quality of the product such as purity, color, etc. to be markedly reduced. The water soluble solvents suitably used include alcohols, glycols, aliphatic ketones, aliphatic nitriles, alicyclic ethers, amides, tertiary amines etc. The alcohols are preferably those having 1 to 8 carbon atoms, and particularly preferably those having 1 to 3 carbon atoms. The amount of water to be mixed is preferably 0 to 0.4 time by weight based on the alcohol. Specific examples of the alcohol include methanol, ethanol, n propanol, isopropanol, n butanol, n hexanol, 2 ethylhexanol, glycerin, etc., among which methanol and isopropanol are particularly preferred. The amount of water to be mixed is particularly preferably 0 to 0.3 time by weight for methanol, and 0 to 0.2 time by weight for isopropanol. The glycols are preferably those having 2 to 6 carbon atoms, and specific examples include ethylene glycol, trimethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, etc. The amount of water to be mixed is preferably 0 to 0.3 time by weight based on the glycol. The aliphatic ketones are preferably those having 3 to 6 carbon atoms, and specific examples include acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, diethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, etc., among which acetone is particularly preferred. The amount of water to be mixed is preferably 0 to 2 times by weight based on the ketone. The aliphatic nitriles include acetonitrile, propionitrile, etc., and they are preferably mixed with water in an amount of 0 to 1 time by weight based on the nitrile. Alicyclic ethers include 1,4 dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, etc., the amides include N,N dimethylformamide, N,N dimethylacetamide, N methyl 2 pyrrolidone, etc., and the tertiary amines include triethylamine, pyridine, etc. These solvents are preferably mixed with water in an amount of O to 3 times by weight based thereon. Also, C₅ C₁₀ alicyclic hydrocarbons can be used alone as the recrystallization solvent, and specific examples include cyclopentane, cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane, cyclooctane, cyclodecane, etc. When any of the foregoing recrystallization solvents 1 and 2 is used, the temperature at which the crystals are formed is very important, and should be 40 When the temperature is lower than 40 The δ crystals can also be produced by recrystallizing the hydroxyphenylpropionic acid ester I from a mixed solvent comprising water insoluble solvent except alicyclic and aliphatic hydrocarbons and aliphatic hydrocarbon in an amount of 0 to less than 10 times by weight based on the water insoluble solvent. The water insoluble solvent other than alicyclic and aliphatic hydrocarbons, as referred to herein, includes esters, aliphatic ethers, aliphatic halides, aromatic chlorides, aromatic hydrocarbons, etc. More specifically, there may be mentioned esters such as ethyl acetate, n butyl acetate, dimethyl phthalate, di n butyl phthalate, etc., aliphatic ethers such as diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, etc., aliphatic halides such as chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, 1,2 dichloroethane, 1,1,2,2 tetrachloroethane, etc., and aromatic chlorides such as chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene, etc. Also, as the aromatic hydrocarbons, those having 7 to 12 carbon atoms are preferred, and specifically, there are given toluene, o xylene, m xylene, p xylene, 1,2,3 trimethylbenzene, 1,2,4 trimethylbenzene, 1,3,5 trimethylbenzene, 1,2,4,5 tetramethylbenzene, ethylbenzene, cumene, o cymene, m cymene, p cymene, o diisopropylbenzene, m diisopropylbenzene, p diisopropylbenzene, etc. When such water insoluble solvent is used as the recrystallization solvent, the solubility of the αβ crystals is so high that the δ crystals containing substantially no αβ crystals can be obtained even at room temperature. Thus in this case, the temperature at which the crystals are to be formed is not particularly limited. In this case, by using the water insoluble solvent in mixture with aliphatic hydrocarbon in an amount of 0 to less than 10 times by weight based thereon, the solubility of the δ crystals can be lowered, so that it becomes possible to carry out the crystallization at a higher temperature and also the crystallization yield can be increased. As such aliphatic hydrocarbon, those having 6 to 10 carbon atoms are preferred, and specifically, there may be exemplified n hexane, n heptane, n octane, 2 methylheptane, n decane, etc. In any of the methods described above, the amount of the recrystallization solvent to be used is generally 0.5 to 10 times by weight based on the material to be subjected to the crystallization. Recrystallization can be carried out by completely dissolving the starting compound in the recrystallization solvent at the boiling point or below, adding seed crystals, if necessary, at a temperature corresponding to the solvent and then stirring the solution at the same temperature to form the crystals. In order to increase the crystallization yield, the solution, after the crystal formation has substantially been finished, is further cooled if necessary, and the formed crystals are separated by a filter, washed and dried. Of course, it is also possible to apply decoloration treatment with activated carbon, active clay, silica gel, etc. in the course of the recrystallization operation. Thus, the present invention provides hydroxyphenylpropionic acid ester represented by the structural formula I having a previously unknown crystalline structure. Also, by producing said ester in the form of the δ crystals of the present invention, the ester structural formula I , which has been difficult to obtain in high purity on the commercial scale by conventional methods, can be produced commercially in high yield without operational disadvantage such as scaling of the apparatus, and in the form of white crystals of superior color, which are satisfactory in both purity and practicability.
