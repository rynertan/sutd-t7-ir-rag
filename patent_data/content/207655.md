# Dehydrated, deflated capsules and methods of producing sustained release compositions.

## Abstract
Semipermeable capsules in a dehydrated and deflated form can be loaded with a chemically active substance to be released over time by a method which first involves gradually deflating and dehydrating the capsules by repeated washing with a solution containing a dehydrating agent and subse quently the deflated capsules are soaked in a solution contain ing the substance to be encapsulated to load them. After loading, the permeability of the capsule membranes may be adjusted to accommodate the requirements of the end use. The loaded capsules may be used for a variety of purposes, including use as a bioimplantable drug or biochemical deliv ery system. The deflated capsules can also be used to sepa rate low and high molecular weight substances contained in a liquid mixture.
