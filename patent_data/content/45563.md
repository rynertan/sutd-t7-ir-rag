# Nickel base alloy for single crystal casting.

## Abstract
Nickel alloys for single crystal casting have been pro duced by varying the proportions of the constituents of a commercial alloy originally developed to give equiaxed polycrystalline castings and optimum compositions suitable for the production of single crystal castings have been obtained. The new alloys have compositions within the range in weight per cent Cr 8 to 10 W up to 11 Ti 1,3 to 1,8 B up to 0,02 Zr up to 0,10 C up to 0,08 Co 4 to 11 Ta 3,7 to 5,3 Al 5,25 to 6,2 Ni balance Individual alloys have been shown to have enhanced creep rupture strength and high impact resistance compared with commercial alloys where the latter are cast as single crystals.

## Description
NICKEL BASE ALLOY FOR SINGLE CRYSTAL CASTINGS This invention relates to nickel base alloys which are particularly suitable for the production of castings which comprise a single crystal. To secure desirable mechanical properties in components operating in a high temperature environment, notably blades for gas turbines, it can be advantageous that the blades are cast in the form of single crystals. However, alloys commonly used for the production of gas turbine blades have been essentially developed to give equiaxed polycrystalline castings and the proportions of constituents are not considered to be ideal to give the best results in single crystal castings. The present invention seeks by varying the said proportions to optimise compositions which will result in substantial improve ments in the properties of single crystals. An alloy according to the invention has a composition within the range Ni 8 10 wt Cr O I wt W 1.3 1.8 wt fi Ti 0 0.02 wt B O 0.10 wt Zr O 0.08 wt C 4 11 wt Co 3.7 5.3 wt Ta 5.256.2 wt Al. A commercial alloy taken as a starting point contains 1.5 hafnium in its standard specification. Work has indicated that hafnium is not required in single crystal castings and its presence is detrimental to creep properties and consequently hafnium has been omitted from alloys according to the invention other than as an impurity. Alloy compositions by weight per cent which have been produced are as follows Alloy C Cr Co W Ta Mo Nb Al Ti Hf Zr BCodeControl 0.15 10 10 2.5 5.5 .5 1.5 0.05 0.015SX 80 0.02 9.5 10.3 10.3 2.6 5.8 1.5 0.05 0.01SX 78 0.06 9 10 10 4.0 5.5 1.5 0.05 0.01SX 77 0.02 9 10 10 4.0 5.5 1.5 0.05 0.01SX 60 0.02 9 10 10 4.0 5.5 1.5 SX 58 0.02 9.7 10.8 5.6 2.2 5.9 1.6 0.05 0.01SX 56 0.02 9 10 10 5.0 5.5 1.5 0.05 0.01SX 53 0.02 9 5 10 4.0 5.5 1.5 0.05 0.01 In the case of the alloy coded as SX 53 the cobalt content has been reduced.In the not unlikely event of a cobalt shortage due to political considerations there would be considerable advantage in a high strength nickel based super alloy having relatively less cobalt in its composition than the accepted standard, In all alloys other than SX 80 and SX 58 ihe proportion of tantalum has been increased compared with the control alloy. Zirconium and boron are omitted in SX 60. This is to raise the incipient melting point of the alloy and allow a full solution treatment. In SX 58, tungsten and tantalum are replaced by molybdenum and niobium respectively to give reduced density. Examples of all alloys have been produced and alloys SX 80, SX 78 and SX 77 have been cast as single crystals. Mechanical tests have shown excellent creep rupture properties. Fig 1 compares the alloys with the control alloy when cast as single crystals. Creep rupture life is in general much improved at 1040 C, at least twice equivalent to a 190 temperature advantage in most cases. The superior strength is maintained down to 7600C and also up to 1100 C not shown . Charpy impact tests have shown that SX 77 and SX 80 have very high impact resistance compared with certain commercial alloys not the control , as shown in Fig 2. This impact resistance was not severely degraded after long term heat treatment and metallography has not shown evidence of precipitation of harmful TOP phases which might indicate structural instability.
