# Hetero nitrogen catalysts.

## Abstract
In the production of cellular products by reaction of polyols with organic isocyanates, alkali metal salts of acidic azoles are employed as all or part of the tertiary amine catalyst for promoting the reaction. Alkali metal salts of tolyltriazole are designated in the preferred examples for production of polyurethane and polyisocyanurate foam products.
