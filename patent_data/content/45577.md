# PROCESS FOR DESTRUCTION OF HYPOCHLORITE

## Abstract
Process for destruction of hypochlorite, e.g. sodium hypochlorite, in an apparatus comprising a nozzle connected to one end of a desorption tube the other end of which is connected to a vessel, in the process pressurised acidified liquid issues from the nozzle in the form of a jet which contacts the wall of the desorption tube, hypochlorite solution is mixed with the acidified liquid before the liquid issues from the nozzle, and gaseous chlorine, produced by reaction of the hypochlorite and acid, and liquid are removed from the vessel.
