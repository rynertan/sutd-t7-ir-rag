# FIBRE METERING ARRANGEMENT

## Abstract
A fibre metering arrangement comprises a supply con veyor carrying fibre to a weighplate, and a nip roller arrange ment removing the fibre from the weightplate, and being sufficiently spaced from the weighplate so as not to cause the fibre to accumulate over the weighplate. If the gap is such that some fleece might sag, a bridging plate or a take off conveyor can be inserted. Preferably, there is a draft between the supply conveyor and the take off conveyor or nip rollers.
