# Electromechanical bistable arrangements.

## Abstract
A synchronous motor 10 is adjustably positioned on a support plate 12 by screws 13, 14 passing through slots 15, 16 in the plate 12 . An optical filter 21 on an arm 20 is secured to the motor rotor for horizontal rotation of the arm 20 between two stable positions defined by stops 27, 28 so that the filter is held stable either in or out of the path of a light beam X through a spectrophotometer. The stops 27, 28 are spaced and positioned in relation to the stator poles of the motor 10 such that application to two stator coils of the motor 10 of one or other of two predetermined discrete voltage codes 12 volts and 12 volts, or 12 volts and 12 volts will unambiguously drive the rotor in the direction of a predetermined one or other of the stops towards a stable pole position of the motor corresponding to that code until movement is stalled by that stop.
