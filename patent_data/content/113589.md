# Apparatus for feeding rolls of fabrics material to and receiving empty cores thereof from a fabric unrolling machine.

## Abstract
The apparatus comprises two laterally spaced upstand ing frame members 24 located at the rear of the unrolling machine 2 , an endless chain 9 mounted for circulation on each upstanding frame member, a plurality of pairs of holding hooks 10a, 10b mounted in spaced apart relation ship on each endless chain, stock supply means 29 for supporting rolls 3A,3B,3C,3D of fabrics material which are to be picked up on at a time by holding hooks on ascending rear runs of the chains and means 25 for receiving empty cores 3 one at a time from the unrolling machine and guiding the empty cores to holding hooks on descending front runs of the chains. The latter holding hooks carry the empty cores to the bottom of the apparatus where, prefer ably, they are collected on inclined collecting members 4b which extend to the rear of the apparatus. Hence, the rolls 3A,3B,3C,3D can be fed automatically to the machine 2 and empty cores can be automatically transferred from the machine 2 to an easily accessible collecting point.
