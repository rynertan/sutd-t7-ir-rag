# Dual air flow fan for circulation of heated air in a forced air heating apparatus.

## Abstract
A forced air circulation heating apparatus 10 in which an air stream is heated at a first location 50, 51 in a conduit means and transported to a second location 40 within the apparatus by the conduit means and is forced into a heating compartment and mixed with a recirculated forced air flow within the compartment. A valve or controller means 154 can be used to vary the proportions of the heated air stream and the recirculated forced air flow which are combined wit hin the heating compartment. The air conduit and the heating compartment can have a common wall whereby the heated air stream indirectly heats the heating compartment. A duel flow impeller fan 102 is used to move the heated air stream and to establish the recirculated forced air flow within the heating compartment. The fan operates with a single electric motor 98 . The heating compartment is vented to a flueway 150 .
