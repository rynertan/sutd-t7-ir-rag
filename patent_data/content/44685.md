# Data communication system.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a novel two wire, two way optically insulated communication technique for minimizing hardware and wiring of a data communication system. A control station 20 is in data communication with a plurality of remote stations 22 1, 22 2, ... 22 n . Each remote station includes a receiving opto isolator device 26 and a transmit ting opto isolator device 28 , each having an LED and an associated light detector. The LED 40 of the receiving opto isolator is in series circuit arrangement with the detector 46 of the transmitting opto isolator. A plurality of remote stations are provided either in series or parallel circuit configuration. If in series configuration, a bypass circuit 90 may be provided in the event of a failure of a particular remote station.
