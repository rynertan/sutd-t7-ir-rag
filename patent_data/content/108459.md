## Description
Soil cultivating machine The invention relates to a soil cultivating machine comprising a frame part and a plurality of cultivating members supported in said frame part, being adapted to be driven about upwardly extending shafts and having at least one tine holder in which at least one tine is arranged. In soil cultivating machines of the kind. set forth, in which the cultivating members are rotating with a relatively high speed during operation, the tines arranged in the tine holders are loaded by forces constantly varying in direction and magnitude to an extent such that an effective fixation of the tines often leaves to be desired. By means of the construction in accordance with the invention a reliable tine fixation can be obtained in a simple manner in that the tine holder has two fastening points for the tine, between which is provided an upright rim, This construction enables a design of the holder in which the holder has great rigidity and provides a satisfactory possibility of fastening the tine. According to a further aspect of the invention the tine holder has two fastening holes and a contact surface at least substantially parallel to a plane going through the longitudinal centre lines of said holes for fastening a tine. This permits of fixing the fastening part of a tine in a manner such that this part can practically not come loose. For a better understanding of the invention and to show how the same may be carried into effect reference will be made by way of example to the accompanying drawing. Fig. 1 is a plan view of a soil cultivating machine comprising cultivating members having a tine holder and a tine fixation in accordance with the invention. Fig. 2 is an enlarged, partial elevational view in the direction of the arrow II in Fig. 1. Fig. 3 is an elevational view taken on the lineIII III in Fig. 2 and Fig. 4 is an elevational view in the direction of the arrow IV in Fig. 3. The figures illustrate a device, more particularly a soil cultivating machine for preparing a seed bed comprising a hollow frame part 1 extending transversely of the direction of movement A. In the frame part 1 are journal led shafts 2 at equal intervals of preferably 25 cms for cultivating members 3, said shafts being preferably in at least substantially vertical positions. Each of the cultivating members 3 comprises a tine carrier or holder 4 arranged on the end of the shaft 2 projecting from below the frame part 1. For this purpose the farrier or holder 4 is provided near the middle with a hub 4A having an inner profile formed by key ways which are adapated to co operate with corresponding key ways on the lower end of the shaft 2. Each shaft 2 has at its lower end a portion of. smaller diameter which is provided with screwthread.For fastening the carrier or holder 4 said portion is surrounded by a locking plate 5, which bears on the lower side of the hub and is held in place with the aid of a guarded nut 6 adapted to co operate with the screwthread on the portion concerned. Each carrier or holder 4 has two diametrically opposite, flat arms 7 extending outwards away from the hub 4A an d terminating at the top gradually in the hub 4A. On the underside the hub 4A has diametrically opposite contact sufaces 8, which extend tangentially to the rotary axis a of a cultivating member 3. Each contact surface 8 engages the flat end of a rectangular fastening part 9 of a strip shaped tine 10. The fastening part 9 of each tine 10 has a width corresponding at least substantially with the width of a contact suface 8 and an arm 7 and it extends at least substantially in a horizontal direction Figs. 2 to 4 .On the top side each arm 7 has a rim or rib 12 having its largest height on the side remote from the hub 4A and being at least substantially parallel to the longitudinal line of the arm. The top side of the rim or rib 12 goes through a bevelled part over in an at least substantially straight, downwardly directed outer side Fig. 3 . The largest height of the rim 12 is about three times the thickness of an arm 7 of the holder 4. On both sides of the rim or rib 12, which is tapering towards the free end, viewed from above, Fig. 4 , each arm 7 has fastening points formed by holes through which a bolt 13 is passed onto which a nut 14 is screwed on the top side of each arm 7. A plane going through the longitudinal centre lines of the respective bores is at least substantially parallel to a contact surface 8.With the aid of the bolts 13 and the contact surface 8 on one side of the hub 4A for the straight end of the rectangular fastening part 9, which furthermore bears on the underside of an arm 7, a very effective and reliable fixation of a strip shaped tine 10 can be obtained. The fastening part 9 terminates through a gradually curved part in an operative part 11 of the tine 10. The operative part 11 of each tine 10 extends at least substantially parallel to the rotary axis a of a cultivating member 3 and is disposed so that the larger width extends at least substantially in a tangential direction.Said part is torsioned as a whole about its longitudinal axis in a manner such that a plane parallel to the broader side is at an angle of about 100 to the tangential plane and the front side of the operative part is further remote from the rotary axis a of the cultivating member 3 than the rear side. The rear side of the operative part extends perpendicularly downwards, whereas the front side is inclined to the rear along a straight line from top to bottom Fig. 2 in a manner such that said side is at an angle of about 120 to a vertical plane going through the rotary axis of a cultivating member and the longitudinal centre line of the carrier or holder 4. At each end the frame part 1 is provided with a plate 15 extending in upward direction in the direction of movement A. Each of the plates 15 is provided near the front side with a stub shaft 16, about which is pivotally arranged an arm 17 extending to the rear along a plate and being adjustable in a direction of height. Between the free ends of the arms 17 is arranged a freely rotatable roller 18. Inside the hollow frame part 1 each of the shafts 2 is provided with a spur gear wheel 19 so that the gear wheels on neighbouring shafts 2 are drivably in mesh with one another. Near the middle the shaft 2 of a cultivating member 3 is prolonged as far as into a gear box 20, in which said shaft is connected through a change speed gear 21 with a shaft 22 extending in the direction of movement A and projecting from the front side of the gear box. The end of the shaft 22 protruding from the gear box can be coupled by means of an auxiliary shaft 23 with the power take off shaft of a tractor. At the front of the frame part 1 a trestle 24 is provided for attaching the machine to the three point lifting device of a tractor. During operation the machine coupled by means of the trestle 24 with the three point lifting device of a tractor is propelled in the direction indicated by the arrow A and from the power take off shaft through the auxiliary shaft 23 and the transmission described above the neighbouring cultivating members 3 are driven in the direction indicated by arrows in Fig. 1. The operative parts 11 of the stripshaped tines 10 of neighbouring cultivating members work strips of soil at least adjoining one another. Since the fastening part 9 of each strip shaped tine 10 bears by a tangential end on the contact surface 8 on the underside of the hub 4A and the underside of an arm 7 and is fastened at two relatively spaced fastening points by means of the bolts 13, a very effective and reliable fixation of a strip shaped tine 10 is obtained. The rim or rib 12 located between the bolts 13 on the top side of each of the arms 7 of a carrier or holder 4 provides not only a reinforcement of the arms but also a protection of the bolt fastening. The invention is not limited to the foregoing statements but also relates to all details of the Figures whether described or not described.
