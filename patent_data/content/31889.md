# Processor on a single semiconductor substrate.

## Abstract
A processor is provided that is fabricated on a single semiconductor substrate. The processor 10 includes and AND array 16 for receiving programm instructions from input sources 12 external of the processor and for generat ing product signals on product signal lines 20 . An OR array 18 is provided and interconnected to the AND array for receiving the product signals and for generating a plurality of control signals on control signal lines 30 . A register array 32 receives ones of the plurality of control signals and trans fers data between the processor and I O devices 36 . An arithmetic and logic unit array 52 is also provided on the semiconductor substrate and interconnected to the register array and the OR array for executing operations on data received from the register array in accordance with ones of the plurality of control signals to generate output data received by an output register array 92 . A control register array 82 110 is further provided and is interconnected to the OR array and the AND array for receiving ones of the plurality of control signals for controlling execution of the program instructions within the AND array.
