# Connector pin inserter.

## Abstract
A connector pin inserter for feeding continuous connec tor pins formed integrally in the comb like form as a belt like carrier, separating the connector pins from the carrier, and pressing the connector pins into through holes of a printed circuit board. The connector pin inserter comprises a board detector for detecting the kind of printed circuit board, means for reading detection results from the board detector, applying moving conditions to an X Y table, disposed below a press inserting mechanism for the connector pin to set the position of the printed circuit board, and further applying press inserting conditions to a press inserting mechanism for performing press inserting operations for a series of connecting pins, based on data of the board thickness, press inserting position, pin size, and insertion pitch selected according to the kind of printed circuit board detected, and a plurality of cam link mechanisms arranged on a same cam axis. The connector pin inserter further comprises the following devices driven by each cam link mechanism a a cutting device for separating a predetermined number of connector pins held by a clamping mechanism, b a push out device for pushing out the clamping mechanism holding the separated connector pins thereon from an inserter head and pressing the connector pins into through holes of the printed circuit board, c a rotating device for rotating the inserter head around an axis parallel to the feed direction of the carrier, and d a feed device for intermittent ly feeding the carrier. The series of operations for cutting and separating the continuous connector pins and inserting the separated connector pins into through holes of the printed circuit board are sequentially controlled.
