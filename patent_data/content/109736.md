# Reclosable valve with separate internal seal means and seal removing means therefor.

## Abstract
A preassemblable, reclosable, moveable valve stem actuated valve structure 21 for an aerosol type viscous fluid dispensing container 20. The valve structure is provided with an initially sealed internal seal 36, 38 and a valve stem 43 operated internal seal removing component 58, 59. The valve structure is preassembled before association with the container 20. The seal 36, 38 includes a seal plate 36 and releasable bond 38. The seal removing component 58, 59 is associated with a moveable valve cup member 29. The moveable valve cup member 29 is operated initially by movement of the moveable valve stem 43 and causes the internal seal removing component 58, 59 to effectuate a release of the releaseable bond 38, thereby opening the initially sealed internal seal 36, 38.
