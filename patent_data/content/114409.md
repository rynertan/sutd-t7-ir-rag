# Wood like articles made from cellulosic filler loaded ethylene interpolymers.

## Abstract
Articles having wood like properties and appearance are obtained from compositions comprising 5 55 by weight of an ethylene interpolymer, such as ethylene vinyl ester, ethylene unsaturated mono or dicarboxylic acids or esters or salts of said unsaturated acids, etc. 1 15 by weight of at least one plasticizer selected from the group consisting of processing oils, expoxidized oils, polyesters, polyethers and polyetheresters 20 90 by weight of cellulosic filler or mixture of cellulosic filler and mineral filler 0 10 by weight of at least one additive, such as organic acid, organic acid derivative and surface active agent and 0 44 by weight of certain ethylene and propylene homo and copolymers.
