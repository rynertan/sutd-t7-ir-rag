# Automatic focusing device for a video camera.

## Abstract
The automatic focusing device for a camera comprises a projection means 26, 27 for projecting an infrared ray for measuring distances a converging lens 29 to focus light re flected from an object whose distance is to be measured a light spot detector 30 provided at the focus of the converging lens and for outputting two photo currents to computation means 36 for computing a quantity corresponding to a sum of and a difference between the two photo current outputs a lens 40 for imaging the object a lens encoder 41 which de tects focusing movement of the lens 40 and converts the de tected results into an electric signal a comparator 39 for comparing an equivalent value to the difference between the two photo current outputs with an output value of the lens en coder 41 a lens driving unit 42 which reciprocates the lens 40 and a voltage comparator 37 which compares an equiva lent value to the sum of the two photo current outputs with a determined value. The projection means 26 stops project ing light at a time when equivalent value to the sum of the two photo current outputs is detected by the voltage comparator 37 , and thereafter the lens driving unit 42 moves the imag ing lens 40 until the lens encoder 41 output value reaches a value corresponding to the equivalent value to the difference between the two photo current outputs the distance measur ing signal value, hereafter at the projection stop time and corresponding to a distance to the object to be distance meas ured, thereby to stop the lens 40 in an optimum focusing po sition.
