# VIBRATION ABSORBER FOR AERIALLY SUSPENDED CONDUCTORS AND CABLES

## Abstract
In a vibration absorber for use with aerially suspended conductors and cables, there is described an improved vibra tion absorber wherein wind or turbulence induced vibrations resulting in travelling waves on conductors cables are absorbed so as to prevent damage to or failure of conductors and related hardware due to fatigue. Known devices, particu larly dampers and spacer dampers, attempt to control merely the amplitude of the waves produced on the conductor and are therefore ineffective in preventing the formation of such waves and the damage that may result. In this invention, a vibration absorber comprising a piston and cylinder device whereby a travelling wave displaces the piston or the cylinder relative to one another causing a fluid contained within the cylinder to be displaced through an orifice in the piston. The absorbing system thus defined has a mechanical dissipative impedance of value R to inhibit the reflection of a wave propa gated on the conductor whereby the wave is absorbed. The value of R is in the range of .5 TM to 2.0 TM where T is the tension of the conductor and M is the mass of the conductor per unit length.
