# Hydraulic noise attenuators.

## Abstract
A hydraulic noise attenuator for insertion in a hydraulic line of a hydraulic system comprises a tubular casing 1 filled with hydraulic liquid and having an inlet 2 and an outlet 3 . A tube 8 , which may be straight or convoluted, is formed with pressure balancing holes 10 and interconnects the inlet 2 and outlet 3 . To improve performance, and thus to enable a smaller and less bulky attenuator to be used, each end of the casing flares down to the tube 8 to form a frusto conical end surface 11, 12 on the inner wall of the casing and the end portions of the tube 8 are covered with sound absorbing rubber sleeves 19, 20 .
