# Automatic transaxle control system.

## Abstract
An automatic control system for a multiple ratio power transmission mechanism having a hydrokinetic torque con verter 12 and multiple ratio gearing 32 , the speed ratio of which is controlled by selectively engageable clutches Cl₁, Cl₂, und Cl₃ and brakes B₁ the control system including a timing valve circuit 302, 322 that is effective to establish optimum timing between the clutch Cl₁ and brake B₁ engagement and release pattern during ratio changes at various driving torques and at various magnitudes of transmission throttle valve pressures, the latter being an indicator of the operator s demand for driving torque.
