# A manual actuating device for enclosed electrical switches.

## Abstract
A handle 1 is mounted on the door of a cubicle in which the switch is mounted. The device compensates for misalignment due to mounting tolerances and establishes locking of the door in certain positions of the handle and switch. These functions are obtained by means of a misalignment compensating unit which is completely enclosed in a housing 10 . The outer shape of the housing 10 interacts with a well 13 in the handle, and the rear part of the housing 10 , one edge of which has a taper 18 , interacts with a locking device in the form of a slide 17 .
