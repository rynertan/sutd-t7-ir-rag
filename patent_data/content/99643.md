## Description
This invention relates to sonar detection apparatus. Many navies throughout the world employ sonar detection arrays to locate and identify vessels at sea. These arrays, which may be 100 meters or more in length, are towed behind a ship by a towline and are isolated from the towline by a vibration isolation module. A detection array typically comprises a series of sensing sections, each of which is for example 15 to 30 metres in length. Each sensing section comprises a plurality of hydrophones located at precise distances from one another , together with the necessary ancillary electronic components, inside a semi rigid tubular jacket, typically 2 to 10 centimetres in diameter. The tubing is filled with an acoustically transparent fluid, typically a mixture of aliphatic hydrocarbons although silicone fluids have been proposed , to improve the acoustic coupling between the hydrophones and the water surrounding the tubing. The tubing often contains, embedded in the wall and running parallel to the longitudinal axis, reinforcing yarn. The main reason for this is to provide the tubing with a very high modulus in the longitudinal direction if the tubing is readily extensible, this can upset the critical spacing of the hydrophones and can create turbulence, and hence noise, in the acoustic fluid. It will be readily apparent that a high sensitivity of detection is desirable and that since this sensitivity is partly determined by the signal to noise ratio reaching the hydrophones, it is advantageous to reduce the acoustic noise generated within or by the array. As the array is pulled through the water, noise is generated from three separate mechanical excitations. The first is towline excitation originating either at the vessel or as towline strumming due to vortex shedding. The second is a tail end effect array tension is low and the array may be susceptible to snaking instability. The third, and most important, noise source is the turbulent boundary layer TBL which develops as the array is drawn through water. The way in which the TBL creates noise is by generating bulge waves either resonant or non resonant . The entire success of towed arrays depends on the isolation of the hydrophones from these surface pressures whose spectral level increases as the fourth power of speed . It is desirable, then, to use a tubing which provides for maximum transmission of the acoustic signals that the sensors are attempting to detect but which minimizes the noise created by the array. One way of significantly reducing noise is to use a material exhibiting high mechanical damping. It is also important that the material should not be too flexible, as this will more readily permit the generation of bulge waves. Secondary considerations include the density of the material, abrasion resistance, resistance to the fill fluids and water, low temperature flexibility, creep resistance, the ability to take a good surface finish, and for economic reasons the ability to manufacture in continuous lengths. Materials used in the past for jacketing sonar detection arrays include plasticised polyvinyl chloride PVC and various rubbers, e.g. butyl rubber and nitride rubber. However, the rubbers suffer from disadvantages such as poor processing characteristics especially for long lengths , poor abrasion resistance, insufficient stiffness, excessive weight and insufficient solvent resistance. Plasticised PVC can be easily processed, but is too stiff at low temperatures and the plasticiser is leached out by the acoustic fluids. The present invention provides sonar detection apparatus suitable for towing behind a ship comprising Glass transition temperatures given herein are measured by means of a differential scanning calorimeter. The composition used to form the tube has been radiation crosslinked to improve its abrasion and solvent resistance, modulus and other mechanical properties. The radiation dose, which may be for example 5 15 megarads, should not be too high, however, because the effect of crosslinking is usually to lower the damping coefficient. Preferably the elastomer and polyurethane are chosen so that the radiation causes crosslinking of the elastomer, but does not substantially crosslink the polyurethane. The performance of a particular tubing in a sonar detection apparatus depends not only on the composition used for the tubing but also the dimensions of the tubing. Typical dimensions for such tubing are an outer diameter of 2 to 10 cm and a wall thickness which is from 2 to 8 mm and from 0.05 to 0.15 times the outer diameter. For tubing of such dimensions, standardized measurements of damping coefficients and modulus values of test specimens of the compositions provide an excellent guide to the value of the compositions in practical sonar detection apparatus. The damping coefficients tan δ values and the modulus values the real part of the complex dynamic modulus, designated G¹ given herein are measured on the Rheometrics Mechanical Spectrometer RMS 605 in accordance with the procedures described in Section 6.4 Forced torsional Oscillation of the Operations Manual published by Rheometrics Inc. Issue 0381 , using a strain rate of 1 and a frequency sweep from 0.1 to 100 Hz. Preferred compositions used in the invention have a damping coefficient which meets at least one of the following requirements It is also preferred that the composition should have a modulus G¹ of at least 0.7, preferably at least 1.0, x 10⁷ dynes cm², at all frequencies in the range 10 to 100 Hz, preferably 1 to 100 Hz, at all temperatures in the range 5 to 15 C, preferably 0 to 25 C. Polyurethanes suitable for use in this invention are commercially available, and referance may be made for example to Polymer Engineering and Science, Sept. 1971, volume 11, No. 15, pages 369 376. Polyether urethane block polymers are preferred because they have better hydrolytic stability. Elastomers suitable for use in this invention are also commercially available. Suitable elastomers include acrylic rubbers including alkyl acrylate rubbers, which are preferred, and alkoxy acrylate rubbers , fluoroelastomers in particular vinylidene fluoride hexafluoropropylene rubbers , vinyl acetate ethylene copolymer rubbers eg. containing 55 75 by weight of vinyl acetate , ethylene acrylic elastomers nitrile elastomers and mixtures of two or more of these. The specific gravity of the polymeric composition is preferably less than 1.5, particularly less than 1.3. Prior to radiation cross linking, the composition preferably contains a small amount, eg. 0.7 to 4 , of a radiation cross linking agent, eg. triallyl isocyanurate. The composition may also contain relatively small amounts, usually less than 25 , preferably less than 15 , by weight of the composition of other polymers and or other additives, including, in particular, fillers, e.g. carbon black in the amount of 5 12 . The presence of such additives generally has an adverse effect on damping, but may be desirable for other reasons, eg. to improve processability or for UV stabilization. The additives, if present, should not be extracted by the acoustic fluid or by sea water. The invention is illustrated by the Examples which are summarized in the Table below. In each of the Examples, the ingredients and amounts thereof in parts by weight listed in the Table were thoroughly blended together, e.g. in a Banbury mixer, and then pressed into test slabs Examples 1 24 or extruded into tubing Examples 24 27 . A number of the test slabs and tubings, as indicated in the Table, were crosslinked by irradiating them to a dosage of 10 Megarads. The damping and modulus characteristics of the test slabs were measured and the results shown in the Table were obtained. The various ingredients shown in the Table are further identified below.
