# Immunoassay in centrigufal field with complementary particles of differing specific gravities.

## Abstract
Competitive or inhibition assays are disclosed in which sample e.g., containing target antigen , a reagent containing first particles e.g., antibody coated light particles and a reagent containing second particles e.g., antigen coated heavy particles are reacted in a centrifugal field. Differential migration of first particles, of second particles and of first particles linked to second particles leaves a concentration of particles at a locus in solution after a time, which concentra tion is a function of the analyte concentration in the sample.
