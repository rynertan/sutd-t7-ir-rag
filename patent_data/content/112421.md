## Description
FOUR WHEEL DRIVE VEHICLE The present invention relates to a four wheel drive vehicle with divided power flow from an engine to a rear axle and a front axle via a differential. The differential in question may be referred to as a longitudinal differential since it divides the power flow longitudinally of the vehicle, i.e. between the front and rear axles. Each such axle may additionally include its own differential which is a transverse differential dividing the power flow between left and right wheels. Four wheel drive is beinq introduced in industrial and agricultural vehicles to an ever increasing extent. Examples are tractors with front and rear wheels of different diameter and axle steering, vehicles with axle steering on the rear or on both axles and articulated vehicles with front and rear wheels of equal diameters and articulation steering. In such vehicles the rear axle drive is always engaged when the vehicle is moving. However it is customary for the front axle drive to be selectively engaged and disengaged. The reason for this is that, if the front and rear axles are coupled when the vehicles is travelling on the road, there is excessive tyre wear because the front wheels are customarily over driven by about 2 to 3 relative to the rear wheels. When travelling on a metalled road with four wheel drive the tyres are therefore seriously abraded. In order to disengage the drive to the front axle there may be employed a dog clutch but this has the disadvantage that it can only be engaged and disengaged while the vehicle is at rest. It is therefore known to employ multiplate hydraulically operated couplings which can be engaged and disengaged on the go. Such a coupling may also be operated as a safety coupling under conditions when traction is lost at one axle. A hydraulically operated, multiplate coupling is an expensive component having regard not only to its inherent construction but to the means for feeding hydraulic fluid thereto.Moreover, when the coupling is disengaged it is driven by the front wheels and significant frictional losses occur therein. There are thus considerable disadvantages with the conventional provision of a disengageable coupling for the front wheel drive. In order to attain the necessary braking action in vehicles such as agricultural tractors it is becoming increasingly common to brake the front wheels as well as the rear wheels, either directly at the front wheels themselves or by way of the drive path thereto. One technique is to utilise the rear wheel brakes to act also on the front wheels but this requires the front wheel drive coupling to be momentarily engaged whenever the vehicle is braked when travelling on the road. The necessary control arrangements represent another undesirable expense, particularly in the case of four wheel drive vehicles in the lower and medium power ranges. The object of the present invention is therefore to divide the power flow between the front and rear axles in such a way that the correct gearing therebetween is automatically established under all operating conditions. A further object of the invention is to make possible better braking arrangements for a vehicle, in particular to allow the rear wheel brakes to brake the front axle also without any need for expensive control arrangements. It is already known to utilise a longitudinal differential between the front and rear axles of a four wheel drive vehicle. The solution proposed by the present invention starts from this known arrangement and the invention is characterised in that the longitudinal differential has a non unity transmission ratio G between the parts thereof coupled to the two axles, such that, at least approximately, Ã‡ IF G RR IR where RF and RR are the radii of the front and rear wheels respectively, and IF and IR are the reduction ratios from the longitudinal differential to the front and rear wheels respectively. In order to achieve the required transmission ratio G it is convenient for the longitudinal differential to be an epicyclic gear. Moreover, having regard to the customary situation in which more power must flow to the rear axle than to the front axle, it is convenient to couple the planet carrier to the engine, the sun wheel to a front transmission shaft leading to the front axle and the annulus to the rear transmission shaft leading to the rearaxle. Various arrangements for braking the vehicle are possible.Since the two axles are now permanently coupled by way of the longitudinal differential it is possible to rely exclusively upon suitably dimensioned brakes at the rear wheels. Alternatively, a brake for the front wheels may also be provided and this conveniently acts on the front transmission shaft and can be constructionally integrated into the longitudinal differential.In the interest of rational production this brake may be of the same construction as the rear wheel brakes. Various possiblities also exist for controlling the brakes.According to one possibility, the rear wheel brakes and the front wheel brake are operated in parallel, Alternatively provision may be made for independent control and it is then possible, by partial actuation of the front wheel brake to increase the torque at the rear wheels, or even to increase the torque at the front wheels by partial actuation of the rear wheel brakes. Moreover, either rear wheel brake may be operated independently when slip occurs at the corresponding wheel, in order to increase the torque at the other wheels. Control of the brakes under conditions of slip may be effected automatically by a control circuit provided with information from speed sensors which indicate the speed of rotation at various points. It may be sufficient to provide a sensor on each half axle at the rear of the vehicle and a speed sensor on the front transmission shaft. It may also be desirable to provide a sensor on the rear transmission shaft.Alternatively, separate sensors may be provided on all four half shafts. Both axles preferably incorporate their own transverse differentials and the rear axle differential can preferably be locked. Various mechanical and hydraulic mechanisms are known for locking differentials and it is preferred to adopt the type of mechanism which is hydraulically operated and can moreover be engaged on the go. The aforementioned control circuit can also control the differential lock in a manner known per se. An embodiment of the invention will now be described in more detail, by way of example, with reference to the sole Figure of the accompanying drawing which is a schematic plan view of a four wheel drive tractor. The drawing does not show certain features which can follow conventional practice. In particular the means for steering are not shown although axle steering of the front wheels may be assumed. Final drive reduction units are not shown although these may be incorporated conventionally at the front wheels and even at the rear wheels. The tractor comprises an engine 10 driving an engine shaft 12 which is coupled to a longitudinal differential 16 by way of spur gears 14 and 15. The differential 16 divides the power flow between a front transmission shaft 17 and a rear transmission shaft 18. The front transmission shaft 17 drives a front transverse differential 21 via bevel gears 19 and 20 and the differential 21 divides the power flow between front half axles 22L and 22R for the small diameter front wheels 23L and 23R respectively. Similarly the rear transmission shaft 18 drives a rear transverse differential 26 via bevel gears 24 and 25 and this differential divides the power flow between half shafts 28L and 28R for the large diameter rear wheels 29L and 29R respectively. Rear wheel brakes 30L and 30R are provided on the rear half shafts 28L and 28R. A further brake 32 for the front wheels may be provided on the front transmission shaft 17. Turning now to the construction of the longitudinal differential 16, the driven spur gear 15 is integral with the planet carrier 34 of the differential. The planet wheels 35 mesh in customary manner with a sun wheel 36 and an annulus 37. The sun wheel 36 is keyed onto the front transmission shaft 17 while the annulus 37 is keyed to the rear transmission shaft 18. By suitable selection of the diameters of the sun wheel, planet wheels and annulus it is possible to achieve the required transmission ratio G in order to achieve the required relationship set out above, namely R R GR R F F R R The rear transverse differential 26 preferably incorporates a differential lock, preferably a hydraulically operated lock which can be engaged on the go. The brakes may be individually controlled as explained above in response to sensors provided, for example, on the half shafts 28L and 28R and the transmission shaft 17. It will be understood that when the ground conditions deteriorate at just one of the front wheels or one of the rear wheels, the corresponding transverse differential 21 or 26 takes account of the resulting slip and, if necessary, the rear differential 26 is automatically locked. The longitudinal differential 16 is unaffected under these conditions. If the front axle is loaded excessively, e.g. by a frontmounted implement, the rear axle is relieved of load and this may cause slip at both rear wheels. This acts as an automatic safety factor because the slip will prevent the front axle being subjected to excessive torque. Even although there is slip at the rear, the rear brakes 30L and 30R remain effective since they act also by way of the longitudinal differential 16 on the front axle. For this reason the front brake 32 may be omitted, particularly in smaller vehicles where adequate braking can be achieved by the rear brakes only. When a large implement is mounted at the rear of the tractor, the front axle has its load reduced and slip can increase at the front wheels. When the front axle load falls below a critical value, traction is lost at the front wheels although the brakes remain fully functional. This can also be utilised as a safety factor but it may be preferred to guarantee adequate front axle loading by the provision of dynamic centre of gravity adjustment, known per se.
