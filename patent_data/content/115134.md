# A storage type liquid crystal composition.

## Abstract
A storage type liquid crystal composition in which a nematic cholesteric mesophase transition is utilized and the anisotropy of the dielectric constant is positive, and an X Y dot matrix type storage type liquid crystal display element comprising the composition. The present liquid crystal composition has a low driving voltage and a long memory effect. This composition comprises a cyclohexane type liquid crystal, an azoxy type liquid crystal, and a compensated cholestericliquid crystal and or cholesteryl oleate.
