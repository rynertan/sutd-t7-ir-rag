# Discharge lamp.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a discharge lamp which has a discharge vessel 1 provided with an external auxiliary electrode 11 . The lamp also has a bimetal 14 which in the inoperative condition of the lamp causes the external auxiliary electrode to bear against the discharge vessel. According to the invention the auxiliary electrode is connected to an end 14a of only one bimetallic strip and in the operating condition of the lamp the auxiliary electrode is remote for the greater part from the discharge vessel due to the action of said one bimetal. As a result of this it is achieved in a simple manner that an auxiliary electrode stimulating the ignition is combined with an operating condition of the lamp in which no hindrance is experienced from the auxiliary electrode.
