# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR TREATING CELLULOSE CONTAINING MATTER, E.G. STRAW, WITH GASEOUS AMMONIA

## Abstract
In a method for treating cellulose containing material, such as straw, by means of gaseous ammonia, which is produced on the site by heating an ammonium salt in the dry state, the ammonium salt used is a salt with an acid not leaving or forming noxious products in the material treated, and the gaseous ammonia and other products liberated by the heat are brought into contact with the material before substantial re combination can take place. Preferred ammo nium salts used are ammonium carbamate NH₂COONH₄ and ammonium bicarbonate NH₄HCO₃ giving off ammo nia, carbon dioxide and steam. An apparatus for carrying out the method is described. By means of the invention it is possible to treat cellulose containing material, such as straw, grain, bagasse and even sawdust with a view to increasing their digestibility as animal feed, without having to use liquefied ammonia, and without having to remove the non ammoniacal compo nents of the decomposition products of the ammonium salt before bringing them into contact with the material to be treated.
