# HEAT APPLYING PRINT HEAD

## Abstract
A plurality of arrays of heating elements, forming printing zones 2 , are arranged separated from each other a predetermined distance SL on a substrate 3 along a direction X transverse the media transport direction Y . The heating elements in each zone 2 are arranged parallel to the transport direction Y . The head 1 is swept back and forth relative to print line 17 , a distance of SL. Releasable backing means are formed by rollers and each printing zone 2 is associated with a roller. The backing means is moved together with the head 1 for urging the print media against the thermal transfer ribbon and the latter against the multi zone thermal print head.
