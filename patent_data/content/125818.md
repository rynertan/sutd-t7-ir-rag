## Description
The present invention relates to a cloned ovine gene, which specifies the biosynthesis of ovine growth hormone OGH . The invention further relates to a plasmid containing a cloned ovine gene as well as a microorganism transformed with such a plasmid. Animal growth hormones are members of a family of anaholic proteins which promote tissue growth and regulate other phases of protein metabolism as well as fat, carbohydrate, and mineral metabolism. In general, growth hormones are single chain, globular proteins with molecular weights of 22,000 to 24,000 daltons. The mature hormone is about 190 to 200 amino acids in length. See Barrington, E.J.,Comparative Biochemistry of Growth Hormones, Prolactin, andGlycoprotein Hormones Hormones and Evolution, AcademicPress, N.Y., Pub. Vol. 2 1979 . Such hormones are produced in vertebrates by the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland, otherwise known as the adenohypophysis. It is generally known that growth hormones are species specific. In addition to disparities in biological responses, growth hormones from different species vary in their isoelectric points, N terminal and C terminal amino acid residues and amino acid composition. Complete amino acid sequence information is available for human, bovine, ovine, equine, and rat growth hormones.See DayhofE, M.O. 1976 , Atlas of Protein Sequences andStructure, National Biomedical Research Foundation, publ.Vol. 5 supra. 2. All of these growth hormones appear to be highly conserved proteins with long stretches of interspecies sequence horology in their primary amino acid sequences. When naturally synthesized in the cell, these hormones are extended at their N termini by signal or pre sequences, which effect the passage of newly synthcsized hormone through the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum. The pre peptide is eventually cleaved to produce the mature hormone. See, Davies, B.D. and Tai,P.C., The Mechanism of Protein Secretion Across Membranes,Nature 283 433 438 1980 . Growth hormone is of particular interest to the livestock industry, as growth hormone is required for the normal, balanced growth of pre adult animals. Growthpromoting effects are due primarily to an ability to increase the retention of nitrogen as protein in the tissues by increasing membrane transport of amino acids into cells and stimulating translation of RNA into protein at the ribo.c omal level. Growth hormone also causes an increase in mitotic activity and cell division, two essential conditions for growth. Animals whose diets are supplemented with growth hormone gain additional weight as a result of increased tissue protein and salt production.Consequently, growth hormone can be used as a means for increasing meat production without significantly increasing the caloric intake oE livestock. Current methods for isolating growth hormone from the pituitary are impractical for producing growth hormone in commercial quantitities. Consequently, efforts have been made to produce growth hormone in commercial quantities at reasonable cost by methods which utilize recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid DNA technology. Animal growth hormones from several species have been cloned and expressed in bacterial cells, including those of the human, bovine, and rat.See, e.g., Miller, W.L. et al., Molecular Cloning of DNA Complementary to Bovine Growth mRNA Journal ofBiological Chemistry 255 7521 7524 Martial, J.A. et al., iluman Growth hormone Complementary DNA Cloning andExpression in Bacteria, Science, 205 602 607, 1979 and Seeburq, P.H. et al., Nucleotide Sequence and Amplication in Bacteria of Structural Gene for Rat Growth Hormone,Nature, 270 486 494 1977 . The present invention relates to the gene for ovine growth hormone sometimes abbreviated here to OGH . Since growth hormones are species specific, ovine growth hormone is the only growth hormone useful for increasing the rate of meat production or feed efficiency in sheep There is, therefore, a need to obtain ovine growth hormone in large amounts. According to the invention there is provided a cloned ovine growth hormone gene, which may be comprised in a cloned ovine pre growth hormone gene and microorganisms transfdrmed with plasmids comprising such genes via conventional techniques of molecular biology. e.g. Ullrich,A., et al., Science, 196, 1313 1977 and Seeburg, P.H., et al., Nature, 270, 486 1977 and the cultivation of the microorganism in conditions to yield ovine growth hormone or ovine pre growth hormone as required.Also provided is an intron free cloned ovine growth hormone gene and such a gene comprising a cloned pre ovine growth hormone gene. rhe procedures leading to an ovine pre growth hormonc producing microorganism can be divided into the following major stages, each of which is described more fully herein 1 Recovery and isolation of ovine pre growth hormone messenger RNA mRNA from ovine pituitary 2 In vitro synthesis of complementary DNA cDNA , using ovine prc qrowth hormone mRNA as a template, 3 Insertion oE the cDNA into a suitable cloning vector and transformation of bacterial cells with that cloning vector, and 4 Recovery and isolation of the cloned gene. Although genes which specify ovine pre growth hormone are present in the chromosomes of every ovine cell, for reasons discussed below, genes associated with ovine pre growth hormone are most readily obtained from the ovine pituitary. Fukaryotic genes are contained in the chromosomal DNA of the cell nuclei. This chromosomal DNA exists in a com pact nucleoprotein complex called chromatin. Freeing the chromsomal DNA from the chromatin, and isolating a single gene tliereCrom has not been a feasible means for obtaining such a gene. Moreover, unlike prokaryotic genes, most eukaryotic genes do not occur as continuous structural sequences, but comprise discontinuous subsequences, which are separated by noninformational segments introns ofDNA. Prokaryotic transcription and translation of such genes might produce a hybrid protein quite dissimilar from the desired ovine pre growth hormone, but transcription of such genes and processing of the RNA transcript in the eukaryotic cell result in a messenger RNA free of the noninformational segments.Therefore, the mRNA usually provides the desired genetic information in its most accessible form, i.e., that which is derived from cells which actually synthesize growth hormone. Anterior pituitary cells are obtained from adult ovine pituitary glands. The ovine growth hormone mRNA produced by the anterior pituitary cells is complementary to the ovine growth hormone gene, and may be employed as a template for the synthesis of complementary DNA cDNA as hereinafter described. To effectively utilize the mRNA for the synthesis of cDNA, it is advantageously recovered from the cells in relatively pure form. This recovery involves separating the mRNA not only from the cell membranes, proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, salts, and such, present in the cells, but also from mRNA molecules associated with the biosynthesis of proteins other than the desired ovine growth hormone. The procedures described by Chirgwin,J.M., et al., Biochemistry, 18, 5294 5299 1979 andPalmeter, R. Biochemistry, 13, 3603 3615 1974 , may be used advantageously for the recovery of ovine growth hormone mRNA. RNA is inherently less stable than DNA, and is particularly subject to degradation by ribonucleases that are present in relatively high concentrations in pituitary cells. Therefore, the mRNA recovery procedures generally employ means for rapidly inactivating any ribonucleases which are present. In general, recovery of total RNA, is initiated by disrupting the cells in the presence of a ribonucleaseinactivating substance. Disruption of the cells may be accomplished by subjecting the cells to a lysing reagent, freezing thawing, or mechanical disruption preferably a combination thereof. Heparin has been found to inhibit ribonuclease activity. After disruption of the cells, the solids are removed, e.g., by low speed centrifugation. The RNA is preferably recovered from the resulting clarified solution as polysomal RNA. Polysomal RNA is RNA to which ribsomes have bound, and which, due to translation of the RNA, also contain segments of the growth hormone protein of varying lengths. Recovery of the polysomal RNA can be accomplished by centrifuging the clarified solution through a sucrose gradient e.g., a 52 sucrose solution at high speed. The polysomal RNA can be recovered as a pellet at the bottom of the centrifuge tube. The polysomal RNA is then suspended in a buffer, and protein is extracted with a mixture of phenol and chloroform. Salt is added to the aqueous phase of the extract and the polysomal RNA is precipitated with alcohol at low temperature e.g., 20iC to 80 C . Affinity chromatography can be used to further purify ovine growth hormone mRNA. Since OGH mRNA is polyadenylated at the 3 end, it can readily be separated from non polyadenylated RNA by oligo dT cellulose affinity chromatography Green, M., et al., Arch. Biochem.Biophys., 172, 74 19761 . Polyadenylated RNA generally makes up only about 1 4 of total RNA. Further enrichment for OGH mRNA can be achieved by fractionation on continous sucrose density gradients. Cell free translation of polyadenylated mRNA and intermediate fractions iE desired can be employed to confirm the integrity of the final mRNA preparation and its deqree of enrichment in OGH mRNA. A number of cell free translational systems have been devised, such as wheat germ extract martial, J., et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA, 74, 1816 19771 , and mRNA dependent riticulocyte lysate Pelham, 11.R.B., et al., Eur. J. Biochem., 67, 247 11976 . Translation of the recovered and isolated OGH mRNA is preferably conducted in a rabbit reticulocyte system available from Bethesda Research Laboratories ofRockville, MD , which is supplemented with radioactively labelled methionine 35S methionine The products of this translation can be visualized by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography. The mRNA fractions having the highest activity by the rabbit reticulocyte lysate test can be combined for use in cDNA synthesis. The preparation of cDNA involves enzymatically constructing double stranded DNA, which has a nucleotide base pair sequence identical to the functional sequence of the original chromosomal gene. As indicated above, the cDNA does not contain the noninformational segments of the eukaryotic gene, and thus can ultimately be transcribed and translated in prokaryotic systems. Synthesis of cDNA employs avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase. This enzyme catalyzes the synthesis of a single stranded copy from deoxynucleoside triphosphates on the mRNA template. Kacien, D.L., et al.,Proc. Natal Acad. Sci. USA, 73, 2191 1976 . The poly rA tail of mRNA permits oligo dT of about 12 18 nucleotides to be used as a primer for cDNA synthesis.The use of a radioactively labelled deoxynucleoside triphosphate facilitates monitoring of the synthesis reaction. Generally, a 32P containing deoxynucleoside triphosphate, such as i 32PldCTP may be used for this purpose. The cDNA synthesis is generally conducted by combining the mRNA, the deoxynucleoside triphosphates, the oligo dT and the reverse transcriptase in a properly buffered solution. The solution also preferably contains small amounts of actinomycin D and dithiothreitol to promote full length synthesis. Kacien, D.L., et al. supre. This solution is incubated at an elevated temperature, e.g, about 40 50iC, for a time sufficient to allow formation of the cDNA copy, c.g. about 5 20 minutes. After incubation, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid is added to the solution, and the solution extracted with phenol chloroform 1 1 by vol. . The aqueous phase is advantageously purified by gel filtration chromatography, and the cDNA mRNA complex in the eluate precipitated with alcohol. The mnNA, being inherently less stable than the cDNA, can be hydrolyzed with an alkaline solution such as dilute sodium hydroxide about 0.1 M at an elevated temperature, e.g., about 60 800C for about 15 30 minutes. Neutraliza tion of the alkaline solution and alcohol precipitation yields a sirgle stranded cDNA copy. The single stranded cDNA copy has been shown to have a 5 poly dT tail, and to have a 3 terminal hairpin struc ture, which provides a short segment of duplex DNA. Efstratiadis, A., et al., Cell, 7, 279 1976 . This 3 hairpin structure can act as a primer for the synthesis of a complementary DNA strand. Synthesis of this complemen tary strand is conducted under essentially the same condi tions as the synthesis of the cDNA copy, except that the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I Klenow, H., et al., Eur. J. Biochem., 22, 371 1977 is substituted for reverse transcriptase. The duplex cDNA recovered by this procedure has a 3 loop, resulting from the 3 hairpin structure oE the single stranded cDNA copy. This 3 loop can be cleaved by digestion with the enzyme, S1 nuclease, using essentially the procedure of Ullrich, A., et al., supra.The S1 nuclease digest may be extracted with phenol chloroform, and the resulting cDNA precipitated from the aqueous phase with alcohol. The double stranded cDNA obtained by the foregoing procedures is advantageously amplified in vitro by inserting it into a suitable cloning vector, and transforming an appropriate host cell with the modified cloning vector.Suitable cloning vectors include various plasmids and phages, and plasmids are generally preferred for such amplification procedures. The criteria for selecting a cloning vector include its size, its capability for repli catinX3 in the host cells, the presence of selectable genes, and the presence of a site for the insertion of the gene.With respect to its size, the vector is advantageously relatively small, to permit large gene insertions, and so as not to divert large amounts of cellular nutrients and energy to the production of unwanted macromolecules. The vector also includes an intact replicon which remains functional after insertion of the gene. This replicon preferably directs the desired mode of replication of the plasmid, i.e., multiple copies or a single copy per cell, or a controllable number of copies per cell. Genes speci fying one or more phenotypic properties, preferably antibiotic resistance, facilitate selection of transformants. The insertion site is advantageously a unique restriction site for a restriction endonuclease. A cloning vector meeting all of these criteria is the plasmid pBR322. Bolivar, F., et al., Gene, 2, 95 1977 . This plasmid is small about 2.8 x 106 daltons , carries genes for ampicillin amp and tetracycline tet resistance, and is subject to relaxed replication in E.coli. The plasmid also has a single restriction site for the endonuclease, PstI, which occurs within the amp gene. The cDNA can be conveniently inserted into this plasmid by a homopolymeric tailing technique. Nelson, T., et al., Methods of Enzymology, 68, 41 1980 . Homopolymer tails, e.g., polydC, are added to the 3 hydroxyls of the ovine pregrowth hormone cDNA, by reaction with the appropriate deoxynucleoside triphosphate, e.g., dCTP, in the presence of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase Chang, L.M.S., et al., J. Biol. Chem., 246, 909 1971 .The resulting full length poly dC tailed cDNA molecules are sized on neutral sucrose gradients by the procedure of Norgard et al., J. Biol. Chem., 255, 7665 7672 1980 . The plasmid is opened by digestion with the appropriate endonuclease, such as Pst I, and complementary homopolymer tails, e.g., poly dG, are added to the 3 hydroxyls of the opened plasmid, using the identical homopolymer tailing technique e.g., using dGTP. If desired, the tailing reactions may be monitored, by employing radioactively labelled deoxynucleotide triphospates e.g., 3fl dCTP and 3 iidGTP, in the reactions. Generally, the reactions are conducted to provide tails of about 10 20 nucleotides long.The tailed cDNA and plasmid are recovered, e.g., by phenol extraction followed by alcohol precipitation. The two tailed DNA species are annealed by incubating a buffered solution of the two species to yield a recombinant plasmid containing the ovine pre growth hormone gene. A suitable ampS, texts strain of E.coli e.g., strain H13101 may be transformed with the recombinant plas mid, using essentially the method of Lederberg, J. Bacteriology, 119, 1072 1974 . Transformants are typically grown on a standard L broth, containing tetra cycline. Samples of colonies growing on the tetracycline containing medium are then transferred to a second medium containing amplicillin. Because the pBR322 plasmid imparts tetracycline resistance to the cells, colonies growing on the tetracycli.,e containing medium must contain that plas mid. On the c her hand, the PstI site occurs within the ampicillin resistance gene of the pBR322 plasmid site, therefore, ampicillin resistance is destroyed by insertion of the gene therein. Thus, only tetr, amps colonies are selected for further analysis. Generally, several hundred to several thousand potential ovine growth hormone clones are produced by these procedures. A modification of the Grunstein Hogness in situ hybridization method is employed to screen amp5 their bacterial transformants for OGH containing sequences. See, Grunstein, M., et al., Proc. Nat l. Acad.Sci. USA, 72, 3961 3965 1975 . To identify those colonies which contain the OGH gene by the Grunstein Hogness procedure, a radioactively labeled DNA probe is employed.Four different probes which can be used to positively select the OGH gene containing recombinants include, in order oE preference, 1 P32 labelled animal growth hormone DNA from another species, 2 P32 labelled cDNA prepared from purified OGlI mRNA 3 P32 labelled purified OGH mRNA and 4 a P32 labelled syntheticDNA probe which shares sequence homology with the OGH gene. To screen the OGH clone candidates, DNA from each colony or from groups of colonies is fixed to discrete zones of a nitrocellulose filter and denatured. A solution of the probe is applied thereto under hybridizing conditions. Unhybridized probe is washed from the filter, and colonies containing DNA to which the probe hybridized are identified by autoradiography. Positive clones may be grown on suitable growth media to obtain ample quantities of cells from which to extract the plasmid DNA. The plasmid DNA is extracted, using conventional techniques, such as disruption of the cells, followed by phenol extraction, and alcohol precipitation. The DNA may be separated, e.g. by electrophoresis on 1 agarose gels or sucrose gradient sedimentation to estimate the length of their inserted sequence. See Klein, R.D. et al., Volume 3, Plasmid, 8891, 1980 . Plasmid DNA containing inserts larger than about 500 base pairs is selected for restriction mapping and DNA sequencing. cell culture containing the cloned pre OGH gene, which was produced by these procedures, has been deposited with the U.S. Department of Ayriculture,Northern Regional Research Laboratories, Peoria,Illinois, U.S.A., as NRRL No. B 15060. A partial restriction map of the cloned pre OGH gene containing insert is shown in Figure 1 of the drawings. The insert consists of 808 base pairs, and has noncoding regions at the 5 and 3 ends. The pre OGH gene is specified by the region from base pair 49 through base pair 699 and the mature OGH gene is specified by the region from base pair 127 through base pair 699. T10C nucleotide sequence oE the inscrt can be determined by the thod of Sander, et al., Proc. Nat l. Acad.Sci. USA, 74, 5463 5467 1977 or the method of Maxam, et al., Proc. Na l. Acad. Sci. USA, 74, 560 564 1977 . Ti nucleotine sequence is shown in Fig. 2 of the drawings. The drawings show the 5 3 strands of the noncoding and coding regions, along with the amino acid sequence specified by the gene. As used in Figure 2 and elsewllere herein, the abbreviations have the following standard meanings A deoxyadenyl T thymidyl G deoxyguanyl C deoxycytosyl GLY glycine ALA alanine VAL valine LEU leucine ILE isoleucine SER serine THR threonine PlIE phenylalanine TYR tyrosine TRP tryptophan CYS cysteine bET methionine ASP aspartic acid GLU glutamic acid LYS lysine ARG arginine Ills histidine PRO proline GLN glutamine ASN asparagineIt will be appreciated that because of the degeneracy of the genetic code, the nucleotide sequence of the gene can vary tibstantially. For example, portions or all of the qene could be chemically synthesized to yield DNA having a different nucleotide sequence than that shown in Figure 2, yet the amino acid sequence would be preserved, provided that the proper codon amino acid assignments were observed. Having established the nucleotide sequence of the pre OGH gene and the amino acid sequence of the protein, the gene of the present invention is not limited to a particular nucleotide sequence, but includes all variations thereof as permitted by the genetic code. The present invention has been described in connection with the use of E.coli as the bacterial host for recombinant DNA containing the OGil gene, but skilled molecular biologists will appreciate that other gram negative bacteria, such as Pseudomonas gram positive bacteria, such as Bacillus and higher unicellular organisms, such as yeasts and fungi can be employed for cloning and or expression of the OGH gene or portions thereof. The invention is further illustrated by reference to the following examples, which are not intended to be limiting. Example I Preparation of Polysomal RNA from Ovine Pituitary Fresh ovine pituitary glands mixed sex were obtained within 1 hour after the animals were sacrificed and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen. Polysomal RNA was prepared according to a modification of the procedure found in Vaslet et al., Nature 285 674 676 1980 . Several grams of anterior pituitary tissue were homogenized on ice in homogenization buffer comprising 0.25M KCl, 0.025 MMgC12, 0.0511 tris HCl plI 7.4, 0.5 NP40, 200 ssug ml cycloheximide and 250 pg ml heparin. The tissue was first minced with scissors and then homogenized in a Virtis 45 homogenizer on setting 70 for 5 minutes.The homogenate was transferred to 15 ml Corex tubes and centrifuged at 15,000 RPM for 30 minutes at 4 C. Polysomes were collected a. a pellet prepared by centrifuging the low speed supernatant through a 2.5 mil cushion of fifty two percent sucrose in homogenization buffer lacking Nip40, cyclohexarnide in heparin at 28,000 RPM for eight hours at 4 C in a Beckman Sw28 rotor. The supernatant was aspirated off and the pellets were resuspended in 4 ml extraction buffer comprising 50 mM tris HCl pH 9, 1 mM EDTA, 150 mMNaOAc and 1 sodium dodecylsulfate SDS . Proteinase K was added to 250 pg ml and the mixture was incubated at 37 C for 30 minutes.The Polysomal RNA was phenol chloroform extracted twice and precipitated at 20 C with the addition of 1 10 volume 3M NaOAc and 2 volumes 95 ethanol. Example II Preparation of Polyadenylated mRNA from Polysomel RNA Poly A mRNA was obtained by hybridization to oligo d T cellulose columns 2X . The column was equilibrated with binding buffer having a composition of l0mM tris 1Cl pH 7.4, lmM EDTA, 0.1 SDS, 400 mM NaCl and 10 glycerol, and the whole polysomal RNA preparation ofExample I was cycled through the column 5 times. UnboundRNA was eluted with several column volumes of binding buffer. Elution buffer having a composition of l0mM trisHCl, pH 7.4, lmM EDTA and 0.1 SDS, was used to wash bound poly A RNA from the columns and it was precipitated as before. The following describes the process of oligo dT column chromatography in greater detail. Stock Solutions and Materials Oligo dT binding buffer lX 10 mM Tris.HC1, pH 7.6,ImM EDTA, 0.4 M NaC1, 0.18 SDS Oligo dT binding buffer 2X 10 mM Tris.HC1, pH 7.4, lmM EDTA, 0.8 M Nail, 0.1 SDS Oligo dT elution buffer 10 mM Tris.HC1, pH 7.4, lmMEDTA, 0.1 SDS . Procedure 1 Pellcts of precipitated RNA were thoroughly drained of EtOll, resuspended in oligo dT elution buffer, and absorbances at 260 nm and 280 nm were determined A260 280 should be about 2, and an A260 of 1.0 corresponds to an RNA concentration of 40 pg ml. 2 The RNE solution was then adjusted to 5 10 mg ml with the elution buffer and heated for 5 minutes at 650C, quick cooled and mixed with an equal volume of the 2X oligo dT binding buffer. 3 The RNA solution was chromatographed on an oligo dT column about 2 g in a column of 0.9 cm diameter which had previously been washed with 5 column volumes of 1X oligo dT binding buffer the column was eluted at a rate of about 10 15 ml hr. 4 The column effluent was recycled once, then retained as poly A RNA and stored under ethanol. 5 The oligo dT column was then washed with about 5 8 column volumes oE 1X oligo dT binding buffer, and then RNA was eluted with about two to three column volumes of elution buffer and collected in fractions of about 25 35 drops with the aid of a Gilson fraction collec tor RNA generally eluted between fractions 16 and 25. 6 Absorbances of the fractions were determined and the Uv absrbing material pooled to produce the 1X oligo dT purified poly A RNA . 7 At this point, the pooled RNA fractions were either rechromatographed on an oligo dT cellulose column to further purify the poly A RNA step 7a or precipi tated with ethanol and stored until used or further purified on oligo dT cellulose step 7b a Rechromatography after step 6 , the volume of the pooled fractions was determined, the solution was heated to 65 C for 5 minutes, quick cooled and diluted with an equal volume of 2X oligo dT binding buffer and passed over the same oligo dT column which had been thoroughly washed with several column volumes of elution buffer and several volumes of binding buffer RNA was then processed as in steps 3, 4, 5, and 6, and then precipitated by addition of sodium acetate to 0.3 M and 2.5 volumes of 95 ethanol 20 C to 80 C . The resulting precipitate was designated 2X purified oligo dT poly A RNA . b Ethanol precipitation followed by rechromatography if after step 6 , a stopping was desired, the RNA solution was made 0.3M in sodium acetate and 2.5 volumes of 95 ethanol were added after at least 2 hours at 200C, RNA was pelleted by centrifugation at 10000xg for 15 min, washed 2X with 70 EtOH and drained RNA was the processed, starting with step 1 but the initial concentration of poly A RNA should be about 1 mg ml or less. 8 After use, the oligo dT column was cleaned by passing 2 3 column volumes of 0.1 N KOH or NaOH through it. The column was then washed with 5 7 column volumes of oligo dT binding buffer containing 0.02 sodium azide, and stored at room temperature. The integrity of the poly A RNA was checked by translation in a rabbit reticulocyte cell free system supplemented with 35S methionine commercially available from Bethesda Research Laboratories, Rockville, Maryland,U.S.A. The products of these translations were visualized by sodium dedecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography. Example III Preparation of Enriched OGH mRNA for Double Stranded cDNA Synthesis Ovine growth hormone mRNA was separated from the poly A RNA of Example II as described Nilson, et al.,Nucleic Acids Research, 8 1561 1573 1980 except that 1 the RNA was heated to 80 C for 2 minutes, then quick cooled on ice prior to loading on the 5 20 sucrose gradient 2 centrifugation was at 30,000 RPM for 20 hours at 220C in aBeckman SW40 rotor. The RNA present in ethanol precipitated 0.5 ml fractions was translated in the rabbit reticulocyte system and the products visualized by gel electrophoresis and fluorography. Fractions containing OGM mRNA were pooled.

The other solutions were prepared with sterile glass distilled water and were storec in sterile containers. All stock solutions were stored frozen.Procedure As a template for ONA synthesis, mRNA isolated as inExample III was employed In order to follow the synthesis, a radioactive 1 ker such as alpha 32P dCTP was used. The radioactive impound was dried by lyophilization, blowing off the solvant with a stream of nitrogen, or by drying in a Savant SpeS Vac Concentrator. For each ug of mRNA, 5 uCi of alpha 32P dCTP at a specific activity of 400 ci mmol were used. The dried material was dissolved in a 2X reaction mixture consisting of 0.1 MTris HCl, pEl 8.3, 140 mM KC1, 20 mM Mgcl2, 1 mM dATP, lmM dCTP, lmM dGTP, lmM TTP, and 0.4 mM DTT. This solution was kept on ice.To this solution were added mRNA 50 ug ml, final concentration , oligo dT 12 18 25 pg ml actinomycin D 40 pg ml , ASS reverse transcriptase 800 units ml , and enough water to dilute the mix 2 to 1.After 5 min on ice, the reaction mixture was incubated at 46. for 10 min. Following the incubation, EDTA was added to a final concentration of 25 mM. The solution was extracted one time with an equal volume of phenol chloroform 1 1 v v and the aqueous phase was chromatographed on a column of Sephadex G 100 0.7 x 20 cm equilibrated with 10 mM Tris.HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA1 0.1 M Nazi. The cnNA in the excluded volume was precipitated by addition of 0.1 volume of 3 M NaOAc and 2 volumes of 95 ethanol 20 C to 80 C . In order to remove the mRNA moiety the pelleted complex was dissolved in 300 1 0.1 MNaOH and incubated at 70 C for 20 minutes. The solution was cooled on ice and neutralized with 30 l of 1 N HC1.

To this mixture was added an aqueous solution of cDNA containing theKlenow fragment of E.coli DNA polymerase I 100 units ml.final concentration , and water was added to dilute the reaction mixture to 1. The solution was incubated a minimum of 2 hours at 15 C. It was convenient to allow this reaction to incubate overnight. After the incubation, EDTA was added to 25 mM, the solution was extracted once with an equal volume of phenol chloroform 1 1 v v , and the aqueous phase was chromatographed on a 0.7 x 20 cm column of Sephadex G 100 equilibrated with 10 mM Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mbl EDTA, and 0.1 M NaCl. The DNA in the excluded fractions was precipitated with ethanol as described above. At this point, the ds cDNA contained a hairpin loop.The single stranded loop was removed by digestion with Aspergilius oryzae S1 nuclease. The ds cDNA was dissolved in water and 0.20 volume of 5x S1 buffer was added. An appropriate amount of S1 nuclease was added and the solution was incubated 20 min at 37 . The amount of enzyme added was determined empirically for each enzyme preparation, since the activity varied from one preparation to another. This was done by measuring the decrease in TCAprecipitable counts from the ds cDNA. The S1 digested cDNA was extracted once with phenol chloroform and the aqueous phase was precipitated with ethanol as described above. Example V Homopolymeric Tailing and Sizing of ds cDNA Double stranded cDNA was inserted into a cloning vector by adding single stranded homopolymeric tails to the 3 OII termini of the ds cDNA and complementary homopolymeric tails to the 3 Oli termini of the vector.The two tailed molecules were then annealed.Stock Solutions and Materials 1.4 M potassium cacodylate, 0.3 M Tris, pH 7.6 pH becomes 7.2 when diluted 1 10 15 mM CoC12 10 mM DTT 4 mM dCTP, pH 7.0Procedure Sizing of the ds cDNA allows an accurate estimation of the concentration of 3 termini. Addition of dCMP residues to the 3 ends was followed by incorporation of 3HidCTP into acid precipitable material. Twenty five pCi of 3illdCTP were used for each ug of mRNA used for the original cDNA synthesis. The radioactive compound was dried and redissolved in the reaction mixture.Double stranded cDNA was dissolved in appropriate amounts of stock solutions to give final concentrations as follows 0.14 M potassium cacodylate, 0.03 M Tris, pH 7.2 1 mM DTT 0.1 mM 3tlldCTP 1 Ci mmol 1.5 mM CoC12 and 2 x 10 8 M 3 termini. The solution without CoC12 was warmed to 37 the CoCl2 was then added. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase purified by the method ofChane, L.M.5. et al. J. Biol. Chem. 246, 909 1971 was added to a final concentration of 100 units ml. The reaction was allowed to proceed at 37 C for 5 min. At this time, a sample was taken to measure incorporaton of 3IljdCMP into acid precipitable material. If tails of stiff icient length were not added, the reaction was continued by placing the solution at 37 C again for the desired length of time. The best transformation efficiencies were obtained with homopolymer tails of about 10 20 dCMP residues. When tails of the desired length were qenerated, EDTA was added 10 mM, final concentration . The solution was extracted once with phenol chloroform 1 1 v v and the aqueous phase was precipitated with ethanol. Tailed double stranded cDNA was sized on neutral sucrose gradients as outlined by Norgard, et al. J. Biol.Chem., 255 7665 7672 1980 . The ds cDNA was dissolved in distilled 1120 and layered on chilled 12 ml 58 258 sucrose gradient 50mM tris ilC1 pH7.5, lmM EDTA . The gradients were spun at 39,000 APM, for 17.5 hr. at 5 C in a BeckmanSW40 rotor. A second gradient containing 10 mg of Taq 1 endonuclease digested plasmid pBR322 DNA for size standards was run simultaneously. The gradients were fractionated and analyzed as follows a Taq 1 digested pBR322 gradient To each 0.5 ml fraction were added 5 mg tRNA E.coli , one tenth volume 3M NaOAc, 2 volumes 95 ethanol and precipitated commat 20 C to 80 C.

The ethidium bromide stained gel was photographed and lanes containing DNA greater than 600 base pairs were noted. b ds cDNA Gradient 100 p1 of each 1 ml fraction was added to 13 ml of scintillate for counting. Then to each fraction was added 10 mg tRNA E.coli , 1 10 volume 3MNaOAc and precipitated with 2.5 volumes 958 ETOH at 80 C.Only fractions containing ds cDNA longer than 600 base pairs as indicated by the Taq 1 digested pBR322 gel infornlation were used in subsequent steps. Example VI Preparation of Hybrid Plasmids Oligo d G tails were added to PstI linearized p2R322 by the procedure described in Example V. The oligo dG tailed pBR322 DNA and sized oligo dC tailed ds cDNA were diluted to equimolar concentrations in 10 mM tris llCl pji 7.5, lO0mM NaCl, 2.5mM Na2 EDTA. The DNAs were annealed at 700C for 10 and then cooled slowly overnight to room temperature. Example VII Transformation Recombinant plasmids were introduced into E.coli HB101 according to the method of Lederberg and Cohen tJ. Bact., 119 1072 10741 . Transformants were grown on standard LB L broth tetracycline 15 mg ml plates at 30 C for 2 days. Colonies were picked to LB amp 50 mg ml plates to determine phenotype. Only ampicillin sensitive colonies were selected for further analysis. Example VIII Preparation of a Nick Translated Probe A nick translated bovine growth hormone fragment prepared as described in U.S. patent application serial number 442,584 filed November 18, 1982 was employed as a screening probe for identifying possible OGH clones from among the transformants produced Example VII .

The nick ranslated fragment was denatured by incubation at 100 C fc five minutes just prior to its addition to the hybridizat.on mix ExampleIX . Example IX Identifying Recombinant Plasmids Transformants were prepared for colony hybridization according to a modification of the procedure originally described by Grunstein, M. et al. PNAS, 72 3961 3965 1975 . The DMA bound filters were hybridized in the presence of dextran sulfate and formamide as suggested by Wahl, G., et al., PNAS, 76 3683 3687 1979 .The filters were pre hybridized in 6xSSC 20x 3M NAC1 0.3M Na3 utrate lx Denhardt s solution 10x 0.2 BSA 0.2 PVP40 0.2 ficoll 0.1 SDS in a glass jar with gentle swirling at 42 C for 60 .

The filters were washed 3x10 in 2x SSC, 0.1t SDS at room temperature and 2x10 in 0.1x SSC, 0.1 SDS at 50 C. Positives were visualized by exposing the blotted filters to Kodak XR 5 film overnight at 80 C with an intensifying screen. Example X Plasmid Isolation and Analysis Plasmid DNA was extracted from each positive clone and electrophoresed on 1E agarose gels made in accordance with the method of Helling, et al., J. of Virology, 14 1235 1974 . Plasmid DNA containing inserts larger than 500 base pairs were selected for further analysis by restriction endonuclease digestion with Pst I and Ava I.Several such plasmids were identified. The plasmid containing the largest insert was sequenced by the method of Sanger supra and was determined to contain the full length pre OGH gene. This pre OGH gene was excised and isolated by gel electrophoresis, again as described bySanger supra and was designated and deposited asNRRL No. B 15060
