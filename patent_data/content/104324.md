# Radiation hardened lift off correction medium and process of manufacture.

## Abstract
A formula and process to manufacture a lift off correc tion ribbon in which the bonding material layer is cured by ultraviolet radiation. The bonding material is not normally tacky, but bonds under impact. The radiation curing elimin ates solvents and their associated handling and pollution problems. The preferred bonding material formula is primar ily a mixture of dilinoleic acid and trimethylol propane triacrylate with an ultraviolet ionization initiator.
