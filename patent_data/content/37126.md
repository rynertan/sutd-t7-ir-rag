# A method and a former for the manufacture of building elements and elements thus obtained.

## Abstract
It is the object of this invention to program the manufac ture of first reinforced, insulated, prefabricated building elements for being completed in the course of assembling with further fittings, covering coatings, which convert said first elements, into also prefabricated second elements, affording the progress of the building with the application of further prefabricated elements, consisting of blocks for standing finish doors, windows, etc. whereupon the laying can take place with the processing of the assembling, the introduction in said prefabricated second elements, the supporting concrete, electric, hydraulic, heat conductors and other services in the hollow seats prearranged in these second elements allowing the rapid, programmed and economical erection of the building in accordance with the previously prepared design. The invention is completed by equipments for the prefabrication of the blocks to the programmed size and internal cavities. The result is an economical building affording all of the comfort of conven tional buildings, with the advantage of a low cost of construction, providing prefabricated insulating walls, assur ing saving in fuel in winter and cool in summer, high efficiency in the hydraulic, electric, telephone services, installed with guarantee of smooth and long lasting opera tion, due to previous programming, followed to the forma tion of the first and second prefabricated elements and of the last elements including the standing finish just from the installation thereof, completed by mutual connections.
