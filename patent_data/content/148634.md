# Ferromagnetic alloy particles for magnetic recording media and process for their manufacture.

## Abstract
Spindle shaped ferromagnetic alloy particles, suitable for use as the magnetic material for magnetic recording media such as magnetic tapes and discs, have a mean aspect ratio ratio of the length of the major axis to that of the minor axis of less than 3 1 and a coercive force of 3.98 x 10⁴ to 7.96 x 10⁴ Am ¹ 500 to 1000 Oe and containing Si in an amount of from 0.1 to 13 atomic based on the amount of Fe.
