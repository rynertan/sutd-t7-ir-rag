# Method and apparatus for improved digital image processing.

## Abstract
An improved method and apparatus for digital image processing is disclosed which permits greater efficiency in implementation of digital filtering techniques. In one implementation specially selected small generating kernels, or masks, are sequentially convolved with a data array of pixels representative of a particular image for more efficient restoration, enhancement or other conventional digital image processing techniques. The small generating kernels may be varied for each sequential convolution. In some implementations the output of each sequential convolution may be weighted in accordance with the filtering desired. Means for implementing the method are also disclosed.
