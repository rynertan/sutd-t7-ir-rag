# Insulating polyolefin laminate paper and method for production same, and electric power supply cable.

## Abstract
An insulating polyolefin laminate paper and a method for producing such a paper in which first and second fiber paper layers are laminated to a polyolefin film layer. The fiber paper layers have an impermeability of 20 to 4000 Gurley seconds. At least one of the fiber paper layers is mechanically deformed in such a manner that irregularities are produced having a depth of 2 to 50 of the thickness of the fiber paper layer. The mechanical deformation is accom plished prior to lamination. Before lamination, the water content of the fiber paper layers is controlled to be no more than 4 . Preferably, the thickness of the fiber paper layers is at least 30 microns. Furthermore, an electric power supply cable includes an insulating polyolefin laminate paper as an insulating layer.
