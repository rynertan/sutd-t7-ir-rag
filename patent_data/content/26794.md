## Description
Novel fuel composition and the process of preparing same.Field of the InventionThe present invention relates to a novel fuel composition. ore particularly, the present invention relates to a fuel composition which is suitable for use in internal combustion egines and which can be prepared from readily available raw materials such as carbon dioxide and water. In addition, this invention relates to a process of preparing the novel fuel composition. Backqround of the Invention Fuels to substitute the conventional gasoline and processes for producing such fuels have been much investigated. For many years, gasoline has been considered as the most ideal fuel for the internal combustion engine.Although gasoline has contributed much to modern life, the scarcity of supply has also caused the so called ener gy crisis during recent years. Besides, waste gases from automobiles pollute the enviroment and have become a public nuisance. Reserach for fuel substitutes has beenlauched with vast investment in many countries around the world. Some processes have been disclosed in scientific jounals patents and other publications. However, low production yield, defficulties in obtaining raw materials, high complicity and cost of the equipment or the necessity of altering the fuel system in the engine or carburetor using the product have made such substitutes impractical. New fuels claimed to be directly usable as gasoline or to be mixed with gasoline still inherit the drawbacks of polluting the enviroment and usually require the alteration of the engine, the fuel intake system and the addition of specially designed carburetors. It is known that alcohols including methanol. ethanol, propanol or mixtures thereof can be used as substitutes for gasoline. Results obtained were not satisfactory. Efforts have been made in many countries to solve the problems involved.Therefore, there exists a need to formulate a synthetic fuel as a substitute for gasoline, the synthetic fuel being econornic to produce as well as being free from harmful byproducts which would pollute the enviromnent.Summary of Invention The present invention provides a synthetic fuel composition and the process for producing same, The fuel composition can be prepared from raw materials such as carbon dioxide and water, which are readily available, to form an alcphol which is then oxidized to form an aldehyde. The aldehyde is further reacted with the alcohol to form the fuel composition.Brief Description of Drawing The drawing shows a flow sheet depicting the process of the present invention.Detailed Description of the Invention According to the present invention a fuel composition comprising a from about 40 tO 95 by volume of a primary alcohol having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, and b from about 5 to 60 by volume of a compound having the general formulaEMI3.1 Wherein R is CH3, C2H5, C3H7, or C4Hg, and R1 is hydrogen or CH3 and c from about 0.001 to 1 by volume of an aldehyde having the general formulaEMI3.2 wherein R2 is hydrogen, CH3 or C2H5. The fuel composition can be used as a substitute for gasoline in interal combustion engines. The present fuel composition comprises from about 40 to 95 by volume of a primary alcohol having 1 to 4 carbon atoms. Preferably, the composition comprises from about 40 to 85 and most preferably 40 to 50 by volume of the primary alcohol. Useful examples of the alcohol include methanol, ethanol, propanol and butanol. Among these alcohols, methanol and ethanol are preferred. Particularly, methanol is the most preferred alcohol since its supply is plentiful and it can be obtained at low cost. In addition, the present composition comprises from about 5 to 60 preferably from about 15 to 60 , and most preferably from about 50 to 60 by volume of a compound having the formulaEMI4.1 wherein R is methyl, ethyl, propyl or butyl andR1 is hydrogen or methyl. Preferably, R is methyl or ethyl, and R1 is hydrogen or methyl.In other words, the preferred compounds are EMI4.2 EMI5.1 being most preferred. Further, the present composition comprises from about 0.001 to 1 of an aldehyde having the formulaEMI5.2 wherein R2 is hydrogen or methyl. Examples of the aldehyde are formaldehyde and acetaldehyde, with formaldehyde being preferred. In accordance with the above, preferred embodiment of the present invention are as follows Embodiment Component by volume a methanol 49.5EMI5.3 50.0EMI5.4 0.5 The present invention also relates to a process of preparing the synthetic fuel composition described above.The process comprises 1 reacting an aldehyde having the general formulaEMI5.5 wherein R is hydrogen or methyl, the aldehyde being in the form of a vapor of liquid, with 2 a primary alcohol hawing 1 to 4 carbon atoms in the presence of a gaseous halide catalyst, the alcohol being in the form of a vapor or a liquid.The reaction is conducted at a temperature of from about 700C to 300 OC , preferably from about 70 OC to 200 6 and most preferably from about 70 C to 90 C, and a pressure of from about 2 to 10 atm., preferably from about 2 to 5 atm., most preferably from about 2 to about 3 atm. The molar ratio of aldehyde to alcohol is from about 2 4 1, preferably from about 2 3 1, and most preferably from about 2.2 1.It is noted that the alcohol should be in excess of the stoichiometric amount. The catalyst is present in an amount of less than 1 by volume of the total reaction mixture. The catalyst is a gaseous halide. Examples of useful catalysts include hydrogen fluoride and hydrogen chloride, with hydrogen chloride being preferred. The reaction time is from about 0.5 to 2 Sends, preferably from about 0.5 to 1 second In the above reaction, it is important to note that the aldehyde is preferred to be in the form of a vapor.As to the alcohol, it may be either a liquid or a vapor.The formation of the fuel composition from an alcohol and an aldehyde is belived to be represented by the following equation EMI6.1 wherein R is hydrogen, methyl, ethyl or propyl and 3. R4 is hydrogen or methyl. The aldehyde used in the above reaction can be formed by reacting a primary alcohol having 1 4 carbon atoms with oxygen or air. Examples of the alcohol include methanol, ethanol, proI,znol, and butanol, tilth methanol and ethanol being preferred, and methanol most preferred. The aldehyde forming reaction is conducted at a pressure of from about 2 to 10 atm, preferrably from about 2 to 3 atm and a temperature of from 3000C to 4500C, preferably from about 3800C to 4000C in the presence of an all Cu or Ag catalyst, molar ratio of Cu Ag being from about 90 100 1. The reaction time is from about 0.01 to 0.1 second. In forming the aldehyde, a portion of the alcohol can be used. The remaining portion of the alcohol can be used as a reactant in forming the present fuel composition by reacting the alcohol with the newly formed aldehyde which is preferably in a vapor state.In other words, a given stream of primary alcohol can be divided into two portions. The first portion is used to form the aldehyde. The second portion is used to react with the aldehyde to form the present fuel composition. As to the volume ratio of the first second portions, this can be varied in accordance with the particular composition of the fuel. The formation of this present fuel composition as described above can be represented by the following equations EMI7.1 wherein R5 is hydrogen or methyl, and R6 is hydrogen, methyl, ethyl or propyl. From the above equations, it can be seen that the amount of alcohol used to form the aldehyde and the amount of alcohol used to react with the formed aldehyde can be varied greatly in accordance with the composition of the final fuel product.. The alcohol used in forming the aldehyde cen be prepared by such waste material as carbon dioxide. In this connection, as an example, methanol can be formed from carbon dioxide as represented by the following equation EMI8.1 The carbon dioxide can be a byproduct formed from theWeizamn process wherein starch is fermented with certain bacteria. The carbon dioxide is reacted with hydrogen in the presence of a Fe catalyst. The reaction is conducted at a pressure of from about 2 to 20 atm and a temperature of from about 325 to 4500d and a CO2 H2 molar ratio of about 1 3. The reaction is permitted to proceed for a period of from about ,0.01 to 0.05 seconds.Thereafter, the gases are transferred to a high pressure reactor where the gases are reacted in the presence of aCu Zn Cr oxides catalyst at a temperature of from about 2000C td roo0c and a pressure of from about 100 to ISO atnt The molar ratio of Cu Zn Cr oxides is 10 80 10. The methanol produced from the carbon dioxide hydrogen reaction can then be used to form the aldehyde and fuel composition as described above. The fuel canpositlon prepared in accordance with the present invention can be used as a substitute for gasoline. In view of the fact that it can be prepared from such raw matend s as carbon dioxide, air and methanol which are readily available, the cost of such fuel composition is necessarily much lower than that of gosoline. In addition, the present fuel composition has a lower combustion temperature than gasoline which means that less nitrogen oxides NOX are formed, thus causing a decrease in the amount of pollutants in automobile exhaust gases. The present fuel composition also can be completely combusted within an automobile engine to form carbon dioxide and water which cause no harm to the environment. Other desirable properties of the present fuel composition include a freezing point of below minus 700C which ensures operation of the engine even at exceptïonally cold temperatures. The present fuel composition boils within the temperature range of from about 400C to 1800 C. Since water is miscible with the present fuel composition, the presence of a small amount of water therein will not cause fuel line freeze up since the water is dissolved in the fuel. Also, it has been found that an engine is easier to start when the present fuel composition is used. More importantly, the present fuel composition can be fed to an internal combustion engine without any modification of the engine or the carburetor thereof.Thus, the present fuel composition incurs no extra cost on the operation of the interntl combustion engine. As will be shown later in the example, the milage provided by the present composition is comparable or slightly improved over that of gasoline. The. present invention is further illustrated in the following examples. Since the examples are for illustrative purposes, they are not to be interpreted as limitation.Example 1 This example shows the synthesis of the present fuel composition from carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and oxygen.

The aldehyde gas 26 is introduced with the remaining portion of the gaseous methanol 20 into reactor 28 where a gaseous halide catalyst is present, to react under a pressure of 2 atm. and a temperature of 800C. The product is collected in container 30. The product 25 refined by feeding the product to plate tower 32. The vapor leaves the tower via stream 34 and is condensed in condenser 36.

Fuels of other composition ratio, i.e. by increasing alcohol and decreasing alcohol derivative content seem to give significant improvement. Pure methanol is not suitable for use in the car having the existing engine design since the milage l is poor only 4.1 km l or one half of that of other fuels .Example ii Examples 8 10 are repeated except that ethanol is used in place of methanol in the composition. The results show some improvement in ignition, starting, climbing, knocking, milage and exhaust properties over those using methanol. Therefore, a conclusinn can be drawn that the fuel composition of the present invention is featured by its content of the alcohol derivative of C32802.
