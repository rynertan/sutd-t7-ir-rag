# Control apparatus for a dazzle free reflection mirror of a vehicle.

## Abstract
A control apparatus for a dazzle free reflection mirror of a vehicle is disclosed. The control apparatus is provided with a rear light sensor and a circuit for driving the reflection mirror into a dazzle free condition in accordance with an intensity of a rear light detected by said rear light sensor when a light switch is turned on. The control apparatus is further provided with a winker manipulation detecting switch, a reverse position detecting switch and a steering wheel detecting switch for detecting a change in the moving direction of the vehicle. When one of them detects the change in the vehicle moving direction, the dazzle free operation of the reflection mirror is disabled even if intensive light is incident to the reflection mirror from the rear of the vehicle.
