# Polymer stabilizers.

## Abstract
Polymer thickeners having a viscosity of at least 10 K, employed in acid media are stabilized with Redox indicators having from 6 to 30 carbon atoms, such as, for example, methylene blue, phenosafranine, pyronine Y, tartrazine, amaranth, methyl orange, and alkali metals salt of diphenyla mine sulfonate and malachite green oxalate, which stabiliz ers are combined with the polymer in a concentration of between about 0.005 to about 1 weight .
