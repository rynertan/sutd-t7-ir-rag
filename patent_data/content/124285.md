# Method and device for detecting microorganisms.

## Abstract
The presence of microorganisms, such as bacteria, in a sample is determined by contacting the sample with an emissive agent, for example a radioactive amino acid separating off the excess emissive agent after an appropriate incubation period and detecting the level of emission from the residue, for example with a radiation counter. The emissive agent may be carried in an absorbent member of a device such as a dipstick or reagent strip.
