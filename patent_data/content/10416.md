# A motor driven valve actuator having a manual override, comprising a one way power flux drive coupling and such a drive coupling per se.

## Abstract
A valveactuator which is operable alternatively by a motor 31 and manually. The motor 31 is coupled into the drive train for the actuator through a one way coupling 35 and a planetary gear device 33 to enable rapid actuation of an output device 23 . A hand wheel 27 is coupled to the ring gear drive 45 of the planetary assembly through a worm 32 and pinion. A position limiting means 37 is coupled to the output device 23 to arrest rotation of the motor 31 at the opposite limit positions of the valve element. A torque limiting sensor 67 is coupled with the ring gear drive 45 to sense the torque transmitted or fed back through the planet ary assembla to arrest the drive motor when the motor exceeds the said torque.
