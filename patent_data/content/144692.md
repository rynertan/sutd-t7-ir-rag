# Auxiliary device driving starter motor.

## Abstract
In an auxiliary device driving motor, at least one of the following parameters spring pressure exerted to brushes 8 and or material of the brushes in contact with a commutator 10 of said d.c. motor 2 and or an armature winding 7 and or a field winding 5 is changed to obtain output characteristic in which current at non load revolution is reduced and the engine is started within a high output region of the output characteristic while the auxiliary rotating machine 14 is driven within a low power region.
