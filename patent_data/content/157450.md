# Shaving unit.

## Abstract
A shaving unit 25 for a dry shaving apparatus comprises an external first cutting member 1 with an annular wall portion 3 formed with hair entry apertures 4 and a second internal cutting member 2 which is cooperable with the first cutting member 1 and which comprises a ring of cutters 5 which second cutting member 2 can be driven relative to the first cutting member 1 with an oscillatory rotational movement. The first and second cutting members 1, 2 are interconnected by at least two resilient elements 11 each of which extends substan tially radially of the rotational axis of the second cutting member 2 and has an end connected to the first cutting member 1 and an end connected to the second cutting member 2 . The elastic properties of the resilient elements 11 are such as to permit the oscillatory rotational movement of the second cutting member 2 , but the resilient elements are rigid in direction extending substantially parallel to and radially of the rotational axis of the second cutting member 2 .
