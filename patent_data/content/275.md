# A stereoscopic film slide and viewer.

## Abstract
A stereoscopic film slide and a viewer are disclosed. The slide 22 comprises a carrier 140 and a plurality of pairs of stereoscopic photographic transparencies 142 arranged in two superposed rows in which the transparencies in the respective rows are inverted with respect to one another so that one of the rows can be viewed in a slot 48 in the viewer 20 in which the slide 22 is longitudinally displaceable and the second row of transparencies can be viewed with the slide 22 in a second position in the viewer in which the slide is inverted compared to its first position. The viewer 20 is assembled from a cardboard blank 52 and includes front and rear portions 24 and 26, respectively defining therebetween a slot 48 to receive the slide 22 . The slot 48 has open ends and an open top and the rear portion 26 of the viewer is displaceable rearwardly to open the slot 48 to a generally V shaped configuration for insertion of the film slide 22 into and removal thereof from the slot. The rear portion 26 of the viewer is maintained in its normal position by an elastic tension member 132 which extends diagonally of said portion.
