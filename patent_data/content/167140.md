# Interruption control circuit.

## Abstract
An interruption control circuit is configured as a memory circuit to output interruption vector information in response to multilevel interruption request for a CPU. The interruption control circuit comprises a plurality of interruption vector generators configured as a memory matrix array. Each interruption vector generator has a function to effect self addressing based on contents of a memory cell functioning as a latch circuit for latching an interruption request and the contents of a memory cell functioning as a mask register in which interruption control information is stored. The inter ruption control circuit further comprises a single output buffer commonly coupled to memory cells constituting each interruption vector generator, thereby to provide an access to a self addressed interruption vector generator to concur rently output the interruption vector information from the respective memory cells to a data bus via the single output buffer. Thus, this provides a small sized interruption control circuit having high signal transmission speed.
