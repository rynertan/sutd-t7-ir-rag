The compounds of the invention of the formula I may be manufactured by methods known generally for the synthesis of analogous compounds.Thus, according to a further feature of the invention there is provided a process for the manufacture of a 14 15 16 compound of the formula I wherein R , R , R 17 and R are each hydrogen, which comprises reacting piperazine 1,4 di N cyanoamidine or 2,3,4,5,6,7 hexahydro lH 1,4 diazeC ne 1,4 di N cyanoamidine either with an amine R R NH,if the required 10 11 product is symmetrical, or with an amine R R NH 12 13 and an amine R R NH, either simultaneously or sequentially, if the required product is unsymmetrical, the amine or amines being in the form 10 of an acid addition salt thereof, wherein R 11 12 13R , R and R have the meanings stated above, at a temperature of 100 to 1700C. A suitable amine salt is, for example, the hydrochloride. The reactants are heated together until the reaction is complete. The reaction proceeds fastest at higher temperatures, but if thermal stability is a problem, the reaction is carried out at lower temperature over a longer period. The reactants are most conveniently melted together in the absence of a solvent, but if desired an inert solent such as 2methoxyethanol, 2 ethoxyethanol, nitrobenzene, sulpholane, n butanol, ethylene glycol dimethyl ether or water, or a mixture of such solvents, may be used. According to a further feature of the invention there is provided a process for the manufacture of a compound of the formula I which comprises reacting piperazine or 2,3,4,5,6,7 hexahydro lH l,4 diazepine in the form of an acid addition salt thereof, either with a cyanoguanidine of the formula 10 11 14 15R R N.C NR R N.CN, if the required product is symmetrical, or with a cyanoguanidine R10 11 14 15R R N.C NR R N.CN and a cyanoguanidine 12 13 16 17R R N.C NR R N.CN, either simultaneously or sequentially, if the required product is unsymmetrical, 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 wherein R ,R , R ,R , R , R , R and 17R have the meanings stated above, at a temperature of 100 to 1700C. A suitable amine salt is, for example, the hydrochloride. The reactants are heated together until the reaction is complete. The reaction proceeds fastest at higher temperatures, but if thermal stability is a problem, the reaction is carried out at lower temperature over a longer period. The reactants are most conveniently melted together in the absence of a solvent, but if desired an inert solvent such as 2methoxyethanol, 2 ethoxyethanol, nitrobenzene, sulpholane, n butanol, ethylene glycol dimethyl ether or water, or a mixture of such solvents, may be used. Piperazine 1,4 di N cyanoamidine , used as starting material in the first of the above processes, may be obtained by reacting a piperazine salt with sodium dicyanamide in conventional manner. The corresponding diazepine derivative is obtained in similar manner. Thecanoguanidines of the formulae 10 11 145 R R N.C NR R N.CN and R1213 16 17 RN.C. NR R N.CN may be obtained by reacting sodium dicyanamide with an appropriate amine 10 11 12 13R R NH or R R NH in an inert solvent, in conventional manner. The acid addition salts of the invention are obtained by conventional means. The antibacterial activity of the compounds of the invention has been measured by the well known minimum inhibitory concentration MIC test. Neat or diluted broth cultures of eight Gram positive organisms Streptococcus pyogenes, S. faecalis, 3 strains of Staphylcoccus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus mutans, S. sanguis ,Candida albicans and fourteen Gram negative organisms 4 strains of Escherichia coli, Salmonella dublin,Klebsiella aerogenes, K. pneumoniae, E.cloacae,Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, P. mirabilis and 3 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were inoculated by means of an automatic microtitre inoculator on the surface of nutrient agar plates containing two fold or five fold dilutions of a test compound.After incubation overnight at 37 C., the geometric mean MIC s for the eight Gram positive organisms plus Candida, and 14 Gram negative organisms are then calculated for each test compound. Depending upon its precise chemical structure a compound of the invention has a geometric mean MIC within the range ll2 kg. ml. in agar against the 8Gram positive organisms and Candida, and 20250 A. ml. in agar against the 14 Gram negative organisms. The preferred compounds of the invention have an acute LD50 within the accepted limits for compounds used topically, are of low irritancy in the Draize test on intact rabbit skin, are negative in the Ames test for mutagenicity, and are non sensitizing in the Magnusson andKligman contact sensitivity test in guinea pigs. Because of their antibacterial and antifungal properties, the compounds of the invention are useful for many purposes, for example a in medical and veterinary practice for the disinfection of wounds, membranes and or skin tissue b for the sterilisation of surgical instruments and other medical apparatus and equipment, for example respirators, ventilators, incubators, humidifiers, etc. c for incorporation in toothpastes and mouthwashes for inhibiting the formation of dental plaque, and gingivitis d for the disinfection of hard surfaces, for example plant and equipment used in the food and drink industries, and floors and walls in the home, factories and hospitals e for the disinfection of textiles, for example blankets, overalls, bed linen, etc. f for the control of microbiological slime in the plup and papers industries g for the control of micro organisms in swimming pools, cooling water, pasteuriser water, aqueous oil emulsions such as metal working fluids, and other circulating water systems and h as plant bactericides and fungicides. A drawback to the use of chlorhexidine is that if it contacts white textiles, which are subsequently laundered with hypochlorite bleach as in hospital laundries, dark stains develop. It is an advantage of the preferred compounds of this invention that such staining is non existent, or minimal. Compounds of the invention also possess useful antifungal activity, for example, against Candida albicans or Trichophyton mentagrophytes, and algicidal and anti yeast activity. According to a further feature of the invention there are provided antibacterial or antifungal compositions comprising a compound of the 10 11 12 13 formula I wherein R , R , R and R have the meanings stated above, or an acid addition salt thereof, and an inert diluent or carrier there for.

Suitable excipients include, for example, wetting agents, dispersing agents, emulsifying agents, gelling agents and thickening agents. According to a further feature of the invention, there is provided a contraceptive method which comprises applying to sperm, or the locus of sperm, a spermicidal, sperm immobilising or mucospissic amount of a compound of the invention of the formula I. In one aspect of this method, the compound of the formula I, when applied to vaginal mucus at a suitable concentration, very rapidly increases its viscosity, to the extent that it becomes essentially impenetrable to sperm, and forms a physical barrier to conception in the same way as a rubber sheath or a diaphragm cap. Besides increasing the viscosity of vaginal mucus, when the mucus comes into contact with a compound of the formula I, other changes occur in its intrinsic properties, such as its morphology, rheology and water uptake and visco elastic properties, which can also effect is penetrability to sperm. The compounds also possess spermicidal or sperm immobilising properties. In vitro, the compounds of the formula I exert a useful contraceptive effect at concentrations down to about 10 3 to 10 4 and a suitable amount to be applied te the human vagina for contraceptive purposes is from 1.0 g. to 10 4 g. The compound of the formula I may be applied to the vagina in conventional manner, for example as a pessary, cream, liquid douche, gel, aerosol foam or impregnated tampon, or in a controlled delivery device of the compound in a polymer matrix. According to a further feature of the invention there is provided a compound of the formula I or a composition thereof, for use as a contraceptive.
