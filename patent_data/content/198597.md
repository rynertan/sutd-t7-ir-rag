# FRICTION CLUTCH DRIVEN PLATE

## Abstract
A pair of disc like carrier plates 6 and 8 are riveted to gether at 22 and have flat spokes or paddles 48 and 50 on their respective peripheries. A single integral annulus 4 of friction material is held in place by the spokes 48 in recesses 40 in one face 36 of annulus 4 and by the spokes 50 in recesses in the other face 38 of the annulus. The carrier plates 6 and 8 are also connected together by stop rivets 24 passing through arcuate slots in a disc 14 between the carrier plates. In known fashion torsional vibration damping springs 28 are disposed in win dows in the carrier plates and disc 14. Disc 14 has a central hole lined by splines 16 to engage similar splines on a shaft. Bearing bushes 10 and 12 are disposed in the central openings of the carrier plates. These bushes 10 and 12 have internal di ameters substantially equal to that of the root circle of the splines 16 so that the bushes will sit on the tips of the splines on said shaft whereby the bushes and disc 14 are supported substantially co axially.
