## Description
Description of the invention entitled MEANS FOR COLLECTING FUZES DURING CUTTING OPERATIONS This invention concerns means for collecting fumes dur ing cutting operations. To be more exact, the invention concerns means for collecting fumes generated during the operations of cutting semi finished products made of steel and other me tals, such as sheets, sections, blooms, billets, slabs, etc. According to the invention said cutting operations re fer to operations carried out with oxygen torches fitted tooxygen cutting benches, continuous casting machines and other plant. It is known that during operations to cut semi finished steel products with oxygen torches a considerable quantity of fumes or gases is generated which has to be collected and scrubbed to prevent air pollution. The collection of these fumes entails certain difficult les in that the cutting torches are moved in relation to the material to be cut and therefore the source of fumes or gases is displaced continuously along the cutting line. Furthermore, the material to be cut may itself bermoving, .as happens in continuous castlnp machines, for instance. A system is known which consists of a stationary hood fitted above and below or at the side of the cutting zone so .as to cover as well as possible all the points which the cut ting torches may reach during their movements. This method of collection requires a heavy flow of air ,since it comprises a very big aspiration surface. Therefore, the traditional system involves the collect ion of air over a great surface, thereby entailing high in . stallation and operating costs, whereas a much smaller sur .face would be enough. Indeed, so as to ensure collection of the fumes generat .ed, it is necessary to have a speed of aspiration higher than a given value in the sone where the fumes are generated.The value of the speed of aspiration depends mainly on the distance between the hood and the torch, the outcome be .ing that the flow of air to be aspirated is proportional to. the aspiration surface of the hood. A more sophisticated traditional system consists of a hood like the one described earlier but divided into differ ant sectors of which each is provided with an aspiration pi . .pe with a relative shut off valve. This enables the aspirated flow to be reduced as com ..pared to the better known lay out, since only those valves .are opened which belong to the hoods aspirating from the zo .nes wherein the cutting torches are passing. Nevertheless, this lay out needs a costly system for the automatic opening and closing of the valves to suit the.position of the torches indeed. it Is not advantageous to put an operator in charge of carrying out these operations .by hand. Our invention is suitable for all the aforesaid operat ions and for like operations it consists of a hood position ed advantageously below the element to be cut, the hood being divided into various chambers. Said hood can also be positioned above the element to be cut,even though the results will be no better. However, an auxiliary hood can be envisaged which is placed above and in cooperation with the oxygen cutting torches. The arm bearing the torches also serves to bear a pipe which cooperates with side openings comprised in said hoods, whereas said pipe at its other end cooperates with one single aspiration duct. In this way the frame itself which bears the torches supports, guides and positions said pipe, which from time to time connects the various chambers in the hood to the single aspiration duct in an independent and automatic man ner. Thus, the invention is embodied with means for collecting fumes generated in cutting operations, whereby said cutting operations are carried out by oxygen torches on sheets, sections, blooms, billets, slabs ,etc. and the material to.be cut can be moving or still, said collection means being.characterized by consisting of an aspiration hood located .advantageously below the element to be cut and divided into a number of crosswise chambers with side openings, whereby.a pipe upheld and borne by the beam means bearing the torcb es cooperates at one of its ends with said side openings and at its other end with a stationary duct. Let us now see a preferential embodiment of the invention with the help of the attached tables, which are given .as a non restrictive example. The tables have the following Fig.I shows a diagram of a cross section of the invention Fig.2 gives a diagram of a view of the invention from above Fig.3 shows a system for connecting the pipe to the stat ionary duct. In the figures the description of the aDplication of the invention gives as an example an oxygen cutting bench 10 equipped with several torches II in line for the cutting of sheets 12. Seeing that the greater part of the fumes is generated below the sheet 12 being cut, said fumes are collected with a movable hood 13 secured to the beam 14 which bears the torches II. A containing hood 15 with chambers 115 is envisaged in the lower part of the bench. The movable hood 13 follows the torches II as the latter move, and aspirates the fumes in the actual chamber 115 where they are generated in this way the aspiration flow , needed to collect the fumes can be lessened. The containing hood 15 under the oxygen cutting bench.IO, which upholds the sheet 12 in the cutting phase, is , equipped with lengthwise walls 16 and crosswise partitionsI7 so as to hold the fumes generated and to create the de . sired chambers 115. The lengthwise wall 116 which is positioned on the side where the movable hood 13 operates, is provided with an.appropriate opening 113 disposed lengthwise so as to enable the fumes to be withdrawn. The side screening is completed with a cover plate IS which is solidly fixed to the movable aspiration hood 13 and which is able to close the containing hood 15 length .wise in a sector 115 in which the fumes are being generated. The crosswise partitions I7 prevent the fumes escaping along the hood 15 and enable the fumes themselves to be collected with a smaller aspirating flow. The fumes generated by the cutting torches II are thus readily collected wIth tha very small aspiration flow. Indeed, the movable hood 13 aspirates from a chamber 115 which is closed at its sides by the walls 16 and partitions 17 and is closed above partially or fully by the sheet 12 being cut. Wherever It is also wished to collect fumes generated above the sheet 12 during the starting phase of the cutting, namely while the sheet 12 has still not been pierced by the jet of the torches II, the system can be completed with a hood located above the plane of the sheet and also solidly fixed to the structure 14 bearing the torches II. The movable hood 13 is connected to a pipe 19 solidly fixed to the beam 14 bearing the torches II. Connection of the end means 20 of said pipe 19 to the stationary duct 21 which takes the fumes to the scrubbing , plant can be obtained by embodying a sealing system with two means 22 having elastic strips of rubber or another material. Said means 22 with elastic strips are put on the stationary duct 21 in such a way that the end means 20 of the . movable pipe 19 can be engaged directly with the stationary duct 21. The end means 20 of the movable pipe 19 can be shaped.suitably so as to spread apart the elastic strips 22 with out any effort during its sideways movement and without impairing a good seal. The connection of the stationary duct 21 to the movable pipe 19 can also be embodied with a hose or an articulated pipe or other like systems. As compared to conventional systems, the system of this invention enables the following advantages to be obtained . elimination of the shut off valve systems employed so as. to be able to aspirate only from the zones in which the torches II are located during the cutting phase and also of related systems for automatic operation of the valves , to suit the position of the torches . reduction in the flow needed to collect the fumes smaller sizes of the plant for collecting and scrubbing fumes hood, pipes, ducts, filter, fan, stack and there fore lower installation costs lower operating costs of the plant for collecting and scrubbing fumes owing to less power being absorbed by the nans aspirating the fumes. Ne have described here a preferential embodiment, but variants are possible. Thus the sizes and proportions can be varied and it is possible to add, remove or integrate parts it can be envis .aged that the opening 113 is not continuous but is separated into sectors it is possible to visualise means which cover the hood 15 when smaller pieces are being worked said cover ing means can be movable together with the beam 14 and or be positioned as wanted. The pipe 19 can be varied as wished, and so on. These , and other variants are all possible for a technician in this field without departing thereby from the scope of the idea . on the solution.
