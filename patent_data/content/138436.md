# PROCESS FOR PRODUCING KETALS OF 2 KETOGULONIC ACID OR ITS ESTERS

## Abstract
A novel process is disclosed for production of ketals of 2 ketogulonic acid or of its esters, which comprises reacting 2 ketogulonic acid or its esters with a ketone in the presence of a ketal formation catalyst. The process is advantageous from the industrial point of view to give ketals of 2 ketogulonic acid or of its esters.
