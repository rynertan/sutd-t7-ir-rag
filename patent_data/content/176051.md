# Flow sensor.

## Abstract
A flow sensor 10 having adjustable sensitivity includes a differential pressure sensing element 48 located in an internal compartment 44 within a rotatable cylinder 40 . The compartment is connected between diametrically oppo site fluid ports 42,43 on the surface of the cylinder by fluid channels. The sensor 48 is located on a diaphragm 46 partitioning the compartment 44 into a first and a second chamber with the sensor being responsive to a distortion of the diaphragm induced by a differential pressure.
