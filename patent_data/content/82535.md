# Unwanted signal detecting and measuring apparatus.

## Abstract
A device for recognizing and measuring the lengths of glitches by sampling the input signal at fractions of a sampling clock, which clock has a period shorter than the period of pulses of the correct signal but longer than the glitch widths. The corrected input signal can be displayed, along with the glitch information.
