## Abstract
A process for the improvement of the adhesion to rubber or a thermoplastic elastomer of synthetic yarns, cords or fabrics made therefrom by applying thereto an adhesive consisting of an aqueous solution or dispersion of a polyurethane with ionic groups, capped isocyanate groups and groups with a Zerewitinoff active H atom, followed by drying the product thus treated. The polyurethane corres ponds to the structure R₁ represents the remainder of a capping agent, R₂ represents an at least divalent organic group which remains after removal of isocyanate groups from a polyiso cyanate, R₃ represents an at least divalent organic group which remains after removal of XH groups from an organic compound having a molecular weight of 62 to 2000, R₄ represents an ionic group or a potentially ionic group which remains after removal of XH groups s , m is a number 1 and 4, n is a number 1 and 4, p is a number 1 and 3, q is a number 1 and 3, and r is a number 0 and 3. The present process is especially suitable for the treat ment of aromatic polyamide yarns, cords or fabrics to be incorporated into automobile tyres or V belts.
