# LONGITUDINAL SLIDE MECHANISM FOR A VEHICLE SEAT

## Abstract
A longitudinal slide mechanism for a vehicle seat comprises first and second elongate members 12 relatively slidable along their longitudinal axes. The cross sections of the members are such that they cannot be separated in any direction transverse to the longitudinal axes, and means 31 are provided for locking the members against longitudinal movement in any one of a plurality of positions.
