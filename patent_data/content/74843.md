## Description
Title Anode and Connection DISCLOSURE This invention relates generally to an anode and the electrical connection to the anode as well as to a method for forming such connection. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Tubular anodes are widely used in cathodic protection and may be formed of a variety of material such as high silicon cast iron, graphite, carbon,magnetite, steel etc. When formed of metal such as the noted cast iron, the tubular anodes are normally centrifugally cast. Internal electrical connections for such anodes may include a wire lead extending from one end or both ends. Such anodes ure often times connected together in a string or series cnd electrically interconnected requiring a doubleended connection. In practice, although there is usually not supposed to be any tension or pull on the wire lead, such tension is sometimes unavoidable in the construction, shipping or installation of the anode. It is thus important that tension on the wire lead from either end of the anode not exert a force which would tend to loosen or disconnect the lead from the anode. Wedge connections have been widely employed for tubular anodes and such connections usually take the form of a lead plate or other center cone which is driven into and forms a lead or other soft metal ring or collet surrounding the center plate. The center plate may be in the form of a cone or a star shaped plate to which the wire lead is cast and the plate is then driven into the outer ring which may deform both the center plate and the ring. One principle problem with such connections is that lead oxide may form on the components and that lead oxide is a complete insulator. Accordingly, it would be an advantage not to use lead which is now commonly employed. Lead also acts as a heat sink when heated or if soldering, welding or brazing or hot sealant is employed, and this contributes to the formation of the oxide. Moreover, it has to be cooled before installation of the anode. Also such connections are extremely difficult to form with any consistent desired low level of resistance. If such connections fail to pass a resistivity test, sometimes the entire assembly must be scrapped including the expensive anodes. Also, while a pull on a wire lead in one direction may tend to tighten the wedge connection, a pull on a wire lead extending in the opposite direction would tend to pull the wedge apart. Moreover, such double ended connections are extremely difficult to form. Also complicating the formation of prior art lead wedge connections is the requirement for complex assembly tools and a heating of the materials employed to attach a lead wire to the connector as by welding, casting or brazing. Such leaded connections are, moreover, impractical if the connection has to be made in the field. The heat and special tools make the job very laborious and the connection unreliable.Also, lead tends to be bent out of shape and can t be reused. It should also be noted that if the connection completely blocks the interior of the anode as many wedge ring types do, it is then more difficult to seal the connection inside the anode. The sealing material would then have to be poured into the anode from opposite ends and this is a time consuming and cumbersome task, particularly with long anodes. It is therefore important to provide an electrical connection for such anodes which can quickly and easily be made and which will provide an assured consistency of low resistivity. It is also important that the connection be inexpensive and readily used with either single or double end connections, with a pull on the wire lead from either direction simply further tightening the connection. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a tubular anode such as tubular cast iron, magnetitie, graphite, carbon or steel, with an easily constructed and low cost internal or center connection having assured uniform low resistance characteristics. The connection is formed by a pair of coplanar diametrically extending contact members or blocks with a wedge surface therebetween so that axial movement of one or axial opposite movement of both diametrically expands the contact members into locked electrical contact with the interior of the anode. The blocks are generally symmetrical and have tongue and slot connection at the wedge interface to maintain the coplanar diametrical alignment.The outer or parallel anode contacting surfaces may be provided with serrated teeth or ridges which on installation remove films or oxides and silicates from the internal surface of the anode tube, and also wiping the anode surface with the conductive alloy of the block. The wiping action will of course also remove any oxide films from the mating surfaces of the connection blocks.Such serrations also assist in locking the anode connection blocks in final position. Both blocks have tubes extending from their smaller ends to which the lead wires may be connected by crimping the tubes and wire. This avoids the use of heat as in welding, casting or brazing. The blocks may be readily formed by die casting and may be formed in various sizes, each size accomodating in turn a range of sizes of anodes. The material of the blocks may be formed of conductive alloy material which is malleable to some extent. The semi rigid material may be a zinc alloy. The serrated outer surfaces are crowned or arched providing a better mating with the interior curved surfaces of the tubular anode also permitting the wiping teeth to deform and match the anode I.D. The blocks may be preassembled temporarily and placed inside of the tubular anode. The blocks may be driven in opposite directions by a relatively simple tool, while one block may be held while the other block is driven. Each block is then wedged between the other block and the I.D.of the anode. Because of the open space on each side of the diametrically extending blocks, sealants to enclose the connections may be poured in from only one end. It is accordingly a principle object of the present invention to provide a tubular anode with an internal electrical connection which includes two generally symmetrical opposed wedge blocks. Another principle object is the provision of such connection where the two blocks are diametrically opposed to each other and held in such position by a tongue and slot connection at the wedge interface. Another important object is the provision of such blocks which have serrated parallel block anode contact surfaces. A further object is the provision of such surfaces which are serrated to provide a wiping action and to assist in locking the wedge block in place Another object is the provision of such connection wherein the blocks are formed of malleable metal such as a zinc alloy. Also an object is the provision of such connection wherein each block is provided with a tubular crimp sleeve to which a wire connection can readily, quickly and mechanically be made. A further important object is the provision of such connection wherein tension on the wire even in a doubleended connection will serve simply further to tighten the connection. It is also an object to provide a low cost method of forming an internal connection for an anode which does not require great skill and which achieves a high degree of consistency in the desired low resistivity or quality of the connection. The connection also readily lends itself to field assembly. It is an object of the invention to provide such method wherein the opposed wedge blocks are driven in opposite directions or one is held while the opposite one is driven. In one embodiment the wedges may be driven together and locked in position by a rotational drive driven to a predetermined torque. These and other objects and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent as the following description proceeds. To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, the invention, then, comprises the features hereinafter fully described in the specification and particularly pointed out in the claims, the following description and the annexed drawings setting forth in detail certain illustrative embodiments of the invention, these being indicative, however, of but a few of the various ways in which the principles of the invention may be employed.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Referring first to Figure 1, there is illustrated a tubular anode 10 which as indicated may be made from a variety of materials such as high silicon cast iron, steel, graphite, magnetize, etc. If made of steel or high silicon cast iron, the anode is usually centrifugally cast in tubular form. In such case the interior surface 11 or I.D. of the anode will have a rough or irregular surface. An electrical connection to the anode is provided generally at 14. The connection is normally provided in the axial center of the anode because of the well known pencil effect. Anodes tend to discharge a high percentage of their total current from the ends of the anode and thus the ends tend to corrode first.However, when anodes are quite long, it is difficult to form a connection interiorly of the anode at the center. The connection 14 of the present invention is formed by two mating wedge blocks 16 and 17 which are shown in greater detail in Figures 2 and 3. The connection may be encapsulated by poured in place sealant 19 and the insulated wire lead 20 extends through the sealant and out of the end 22 of the anode through centering disc 23. In the embodiment illustrated in Figure 1, a wire lead extends outwardly through one end only of the anode but it will be appreciated that a double ended anode may be provided with leads extending from both ends. The other wire lead in a double ended connection would be as indicated by the phantom lines seen at 25. Referring now more particularly to Figures 2 and 3, it will be seen that each block 16 and 17 may be formed integrally of a malleable zinc alloy by die casting. Such blocks 16 and 17 each include parallel block anode contacting surfaces which are serrated as seen at 27 and 28, respectively.Such surfaces are also slightly crowned or arched longitudinally of the blocks as seen more clearly in Figure 3. The blocks are generally triangular in shape and each includes a wedge interface as seen at 30 and 31, respectively. In the illustrated embodiment the wedge angle may be 200 with respect to the axis of the anode. Depending upon the anode material and application, the wedge angle may vary considerably such as from about 50 to about 400 and may be greater than the angle of friction. Although the blocks are quite similar and generally symmetrical about the wedge interface, it is noted that the block 16 includes a tongue 32 along the wedge interface while the block 17 includes a slot 33. It is also noted that the wedge interface 30 is chamfered or relieved as indicated at 35, beyond the tongue 32 while the wedge interface 31 is relieved in a similar manner at 36 on each side of the slot, 33. This permits clearance with the tubular extensions projecting at 38 and 39 from the smaller end faces 40 and 41 of the blocks 16 and 17, respectively.To attach the bare end of the lead wire to the blocks, the bare end is simply inserted into the respective tube and the tube is then crimped on the bare lead end as indicated at 43 in Figure 1. Each block is provided with a solid center web more narrow than the total width of the block and of the triangular configuration seen at 45 and 46. The web is, of course, of sufficient thickness to resist the compressive forces on the block when in tight wedged engagement in the anode. The larger end faces of the block seen at 47 and 48, respectively, extend normal to the axis of the anode and may be engaged or tapped by simplified driving tools seen in phantom lines in Figure 2 at 50 and 51, respectively. In order to assemble the connection within the anode, the blocks are first preassembled in the relative positions seen by the phantom lines in Figure 2. Thus, the block 17 will achieve the position seen at 53 with its surface 28 having some clearance indicated at 54 within the I.D. of the tube seen at 55. The surge 27 of the opposite block 16 simply rests on the I.D. of the tube as seen at 56. The blocks may be held together in their preassembled relationship shown by the suitable temporary fastener such as a piece of tape seen at 57, or by a conductive shim in the interface between the tongue and slot. With the blocks of the connection properly in position within the tube, the driving tools 50 and 51 are employed to drive the blocks in the opposite direction as seen by the arrows 60 and 61. This causes the wedge interface of the two blocks to diametrically separate the blocks closing the clearance 54 and driving the surfaces 27 and 28 first into wiping engagement and then into locking engagement with the I.D. 11 of the tube. It is noted that the serrations on the surfaces 27 and 28 include acutely angled leading edges 63 and sharply angled trailing edges 64 to achieve the noted initial wiping action without unduly resisting the driving of the clocks into locking engagement. The more sharply defined edges 64 assist in locking the blocks in position when driven to the desired locking pressure. Such wiping action of the ridges of the serrations serve to remove films or oxides and silicates from the internal surfaces of the anode tube, and also to smear the semi rigid material of the block such as a zinc alloy along the inside surface of the anode. Such semi rigid material also readily conforms to any irregularities normally found in the internal surface of centrifugally cast anodes.It will be appreciated that the wedge blocks are normally assembled as seen in Figure 2 with the lead wire connections already made. It will also be appreciated that the lead wire connections may be made from both blocks and that any tension or pulling on the wires will simply tend to tighten the connection. If after the connection is made, for some reason the connection has to be disassembled such as for failure to pass a quality control test, the blocks can easily be removed by using the tools 50 and 51 to drive the blocks in the opposite direction engaging the more narrow end faces thereof. The locks and anodes may be reused. Such techniques can be use to avoid scrap anodes which are very costly and to assure quality control. It will also be appreciated that the blocks may even be removed after the sealants are in place. Depending on the particular sealant employed, it may be drilled out or removed and then the blocks removed It will be appreciated that the serrations on the surfaces 27 and 28 which wipe in one direction and lock in the opposite direction may vary as to the number of teeth and coarseness thereof.The configuration of the serration normally depends on the material of the anode. For example, in a graphite anode, there may be two to three times as many teeth providing a much finer texture. The crowned serrated outer surfaces permit ensured good wiping and locking contact with the interior of the anode and tend to match the circle of the anode regardless of the diameter of the anode. As seen in Figure 6, for an anode 66 of somewhat smaller diameter Ithe crowned serrated surface 28 engages and wipes primarily along the lateral edges of the surface as seen at 67 and 68. For a larger diameter as seen at 70 inFigure 7, the wiping and engaging action is primarily at the center of the crown as seen at 71. In either case such action tends to change the radius of the crown to conform to the anode. It will also be appreciated that the blocks 16 and 17 may be formed in a variety of sizes to accomodate for each size a fairly wide range of anode sizes. In the embodiment seen in Figure 5, the block 16 is provided along the top of the tongue 32 with a yieldable shim 74 which is in the form of a leaf spring held in place by flush head fastener or rivet 75. The spring compensates for expansion or contraction of the anode I.D. in high temperature operating conditions or in fluctuating temperature operating conditions. Although the connection is preferably formed at the middle of the anode, it will be appreciated that it can be formed as quickly anywhere along the interior of the anode. Once the connection is formed with the single or double end connection, the connection may be readily encased or encapsulated in plastic sealants such as epoxies or the like by forming a temporary dam indicated at 78 then pouring sealant 19 in from the open upper end 22. Because of the relatively large semi circular open spaces on each side of the wedge blocks as seen at 80 and 81 in Figure 4, the sealant will readily flow past the connection. The wire or lead extends outwardly and then through the centering disc which of course may be provided t both ends in connection with a double ended anode. Referring now to the embodiment of Figures 8 and 9, it will be seen that the wedges may be driven and locked together by the mechanism shown. The wedge blocks 83 and 84 may be substantially the same or similar to the wedge blocks 16 and 17 seen in Figure 2. The larger end wall 85 of the wedge block 83 is provided with horizontally aligned corner notches 86 which receive a wire cinch or band 87 which encircles both wedge blocks. The larger end wall 88 of the wedge block 84 is provided with blind untapped hole 90 receiving threaded stud 91 which is provided with a hexagonal head 92. Mounted on the threaded stud is a nut 94 to which the opposite ends of the wire or band cinch 87 are secured as seen at 95. The wedge blocks are then assembled in the position shown by full lines and by then driving the hexagonal head to rotate the threaded stud 91, the nut 94 is drawn away from the end wall 88 forcing the top block 84 to the left and the bottom block 83 to the right as seen in Figure 8, driving the top block up to the relative position seen in phantom lines at 96. The stud and nut then act as a reaction member between the cinch and the blocks driving the blocks into wedge locking relationship within the interior of the anode.The wedge blocks are provided with the wire lead crimp sleeves or tubes seen at 98 and 99, respectively. The threaded stud 91 may readily be rotated inside the anode by a suitable socket heat extension and the wedges may be tightened to a predetermined torque to provide the desired wedge locking action and the low resistance connection. This construction enables connections readily to be made in tubular anodes where one end may be closed. TEe cinch or band being inherently elastic acts as a spring lock keeping pressure on the wedge blocks regardless of minor anode l.D. variations due to temperature expansions and contractions. In the embodiment of Figures 10 and 11, it will be seen that instead of coplanar blocks, each of the mating blocks 101 and 102 is provided with two angularly related legs at approximately 900 as seen at 103 and 104 for the block 101, and 105 and 106 for the block 102. The connection then provides four contact surfaces inside the tubular anode 107 as seen at 108, 109, 110 and 111. The contact surfaces 108 and 110 are diametrically opposed to each other while the surfaces 109 and 111 are also diametrically opposed. The wire lead crimp tubes 113 and 114 may extend from the legs 106 and 103, respectively, but it will be appreciated that they may be provided on each leg and in different positions. In any event, with the embodiment of Figures 10 and 11, it will be seen that each wedge block includes at least two anode contacting surfaces and that the connection is in the form of an X with each contacting surface approximately 900 apart. For both of the embodiments of Figures 8 and 10 it will be appreciated that the wedge interface between the blocks is provided with the tongue and slot connection. It can now be seen that there is provided a tubular anode with a low cost, easily made, and reliable electrical connection.Moreover, the connection does not require expansion or distortion of the anode. With the connection a single or double ended connection can readily be made and any tension on the lead wire serves simply to tighten the connection. Moreover, one size of connector components will handle a wide range of sizes of anodes and the wiping teeth or serrations on the curved or crowned connection anode surfaces tend to deform to match the anode I.D. Also, the connection can simply and quickly be made, even in the field, or removed if need be.
