## Description
INTERNAL BOUNDARY LAYER CERAMIC COMPOSITIONS This invention relates to polycrystalline semiconducting ceramic compositions having internal insulated grain boundaries, to methods for producing such compositions, and to capacitors utilizing such compositions as a dielectric. Ceramic compositions having internal insulated grain boundaries are known in the art. For example, compositions based on barium titanate having a perovskite lattice doped with Sb2O3 to provide n type conductivity and with CuO to provide p type conductivity are disclosed inBrauer, et al., U.S. Patent No. 3,569,802, which patent is incorporated herein by reference as illustrative of the state of the art. Such compositions have grain sizes in the range of about 20 300 microns and have a high dielectric constant value however, because they are based on a ferroelectric material, they exhibit the usual Curie Weiss temperature dependence with as high as 80 change in capacitance over a temperature range of 30 to 850 C, and a saturation of dielectric constant with voltage. A somewhat more stable polycrystalline semiconducting ceramic composition can be produced by sintering strontium titanate with a small amount of Nb205 or Ta205 and a small amount of GeO2 or ZnO.The internal grain boundaries are insulated by diffusing therein Bi2O3 or a mixture of Bi203, PbO, and B203 from the surface of a pellet. Such compositions are disclosed in Takahashi, et al., U.S. Patent No. 3,933,668 which patent is incorporated herein by reference as illustrative of the art relating to strontium titanate ceramics. These compositions typically exhibit high dielectric constant values, temperature coefficients of capacitance in the neighborhood of 15 , and grain sizes greater than 25 microns. Although the abovedescribed semiconducting ceramic compositions having internal insulating boundaries provide high dielectric constant values, they are limited in their application because of their relatively high temperature and voltage coefficients of capacitance, and their large grain sizes further they cannot be successfully fabricated into thin layer, multi layer devices. Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to provide polycrystalline semi conducting ceramic compositions having internal insulated grain boundaries that exhibit high dielectric constant values, low dissipation factors, and low temperature and voltage coefficients of capacitance. Another object of this invention is to produce fine grained ceramics suitable for the fabrication of thin layer, multi layer capacitors. A further object of this invention is to provide a process in which the internal insulating grain boundaries are produced by liquid phase sintering with lead germanate at temperatures well below those required in prior art diffusion processes. These and other objects wffl become apparent as description of the invention proceeds. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING Fig. 1 is a phase diagram of the PbO GeO2 system showing the melting points of various lead germanate compositions. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The semiconducting ceramic compositions of this invention comprise a major amount of a polycrystalline alkaline earth metal titanate doped with a small amount of a metal oxide capable of providing n type semiconductivity and a minor amount of a lead germanate composition. The term lead germanate in this specification is meant to include lead and germanium containing compounds such as Pb5Ge3O11, and lead, germanium, and silicon containing compounds defined by the formula PbO x GeO2 y z SiO2 z where x ranges from 1 to 6, y ranges from 1 to 3, and z ranges from 0.0 to 0.75y. Mixtures of two or more compositions can also be used. The ceramic compositions are characterized in that the lead germanate composition is incorporated therein by liquid phase sintering which provides an insulating boundary layer about the grains of the polycrystalline semiconducting alkaline earth metal titanate. Suitable alkaline earth metal titanates possess a perovskite lattice structure and comprise strontium titanate, barium titanate, calcium titanate, and mixtures thereof. Strontium titanate is the preferred material and can be obtained from mixtures of SrO and TiO2, SrCO3 andTiO2, and from other sources well known in the art. The metal oxide providing n type semiconductivity is suitably a hexavalent metal oxide having the formula M03 Bi203 X where M is tungsten W or molybdenum Mo , and x ranges from 0 to 7.Materials that afford Wo3 or MoO3 during calcination can be used to advantage examples of such materials are the acids H2WO4 and H2MoO4 and salts thereof. Lead germanate compositions suitable for the liquid phase sintering step can be prepared by heating various mixture of PbO andGeO2 up to temperatures of about 10000 C. The phase diagram in Figure 1 shows the melting points for various molar ratios of PbO and GeO2. For the purpose of this invention, lead germanate compositions having melting points below about 8500 C are preferred. Because of the relatively high cost of GeO2 a portion of it can be replaced advantageously with SiO2. The lead germanate composition having the formula Pb5 Ge3O11 is a preferred composition because it melts congruently i.e., solid and liquid phases have identical compositions to provide a low viscosity melt which permits rapid and complete liquid phase sintering at temperatures as low as 8500 C. The composition is prepared by heating a mixture of 5 moles of PbO and 3 moles of GeO2 in a platinum crucible at 8000 C.The cooled product, having the formula Pb5Ge3O11, is crushed and powdered in a mortar and pestle, screened through a 325 mesh screen, and further reduced by ball milling. The final powder has a particle size ranging between about 0.5 and 30 microns with the greatest concentration at about 5 microns. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The ceramic compositions of this invention are produced by the steps of calcining fine particle size alkaline earth metal titanate, or a mixture of alkaline earth oxide or carbonate with TiO2, with a small amount of the hexavalent metal oxide disclosed above to produce n type semiconductivity milling and blending the powder with the lead germanate composition disclosed above and pressing and firing the mixture in air or a reducing atmosphere to produce internal insulating boundary layers about the grains of the semiconducting titanate by liquid phase intering. Generally from about 90 to about 99.99, preferably from about 95 to about 99, percent by weight of the alkaline earth metal titanate is calcined with generally from about 0.01 to about 10, preferably from about 1 to about 5, percent by weight of the hexavalent metal oxide in air or a reducing atmosphere to produce n type semiconductivity.Calcination is conveniently carried out at a temperature of about 1000 to about 14000 C for about 1 to about 4 hours in a weakly reducing atmosphere, for example a forming gas containing about 10 of hydrogen.The resulting powder is milled and blended with generally from about 0.01 to about 35, preferably from about 1 to about 10, percent by weight of the lead germanate composition, and is then pressed and fired to provide, by liquid phase sintering, internal insulating boundary layers about the grains of the metal titanate. The liquid phase sintering step is conveniently carried out a temperature in the range of from about 850 to about 13000 C for from about 1 to about 60 minutes in air or a weakly reducing atmosphere. The method of the invention is particularly advantageous in that it yields a ceramic composition having a grain size which is not appreciably larger than the particle size of the alkaline earth metal titanate used in making the ceramic, in contrast to methods of the prior art which caused a substantial increase in grain size. Accordingly, by using appropriately fine titaflate as starting material, the invention provides ceramic compositions having a grain size less than 10 microns, suitably about 2 microns or less, which are particularly useful for the production of thin layer, multi layer capacitors having excellent dielectric properties.Since the thickness of the layers in a multi layer capacitor is limited by the grain size of the ceramic, the ceramic compositions of the invention can be used to make multi layer capacitors in which each layer is much thinner than was previously possible using the ceramic compositions heretofore known. The invention is further illustrated by reference to the following procedures and examples. EXAMPLE 1 Fine particle size strontium titanate 1 micron was reduced by calcining with 2 by weight of WO3 in a 10 hydrogen atmosphere at 13800 C for 4 hours to produce a n type semiconductor. To the resulting powder was added 5 by weight of Pb5Ge3O11, the mixture was milled and blended, and then pressed into discs 1 cm in diameter, 0.5 mm thick and fired at 12000 C for 30 minutes to produce internal insulating boundary layers about the strontium titanate grains by liquid phase sintering. The discs were electroded with fritted silver paste and fired in air at 8000 C for 5 minutes. Dielectric constant K and dissipation factor DF were recorded at 100 KHz and 0.5 volts AC. The voltage coefficient of capacitance VC was measured at 200 volts DC. The temperature coefficient of capacitance TC was measured over the temperature range of 55 to 1250 C. Typical values found for the capacitors prepared in this example were k 5,000 10,000 Df 3 max VC 5 max TC 5 max. EXAMPLE 2 Fine particle size strontium titanate 1 micron was reduced by calcining with 2 by weight of Bi2WO6 in a 10 hydrogen atmosphere at 12000 C for 2 hours to produce an n type semiconductor. To the resulting powder was added 5 by weight of Pb5Ge3O11, the mixture was milled and blended, and then pressed into discs 1 cm in diameter, 0.5 mm thick and fired at 12000 C for 30 minutes to produce internal insulating boundary layers by liquid phase sintering. The discs were electroded with fritted silver paste and fired in air at 8000 C for 5 minutes. Typical values found for capacitors prepared in this example were K 5,000 10,000 DF 3 max VC 5 max TC 5 max. It is clear that a stabilized high dielectric constant ceramic composition having internal insulated boundary layers can be produced from the herein disclosed components by a liquid phase sintering technique using the herein disclosed lead germanate composition. Electrical properties of the capacitors fabricated from the inventive ceramic composition such as dielectric constant, dissipation factor, voltage and temperature coefficients of capacitance, appear exceedingly attractive for various applications including high capacitance, low voltage markets and thin layer, multi layer devices.
