# MULTILAYER DECORATIVE COATING

## Abstract
Disclosed is a coated article, for example an architectural transparency, including a vehicular transparency, or a reflect ing article, as a decorative article. The article has a substrate, e.g., a substantially transparent or substantially opaque subs trate. The substrate has an optical coating on it, that is a coating having a thin film of an oxide of a transition metal, the thin film having a thickness corresponding to a constructively interfering function of a wavelength of interest. The optical coating, having a thin film of a transition metal, enhances the reflectivity of some wavelengths of the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum and the reflectivity of other wavelengths of the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.
