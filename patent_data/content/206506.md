# Additive for inhibiting respiration of and promoting desiccation of crops.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a process for applying an aqueous solution comprising formate anions and a cation selected from sodium, potassium and calcium to a crop to inhibit respiration of the crop and to accelerate desiccation thereof. The aqueous solution contains the anions and cations in a ratio of at least 4 1 on a chemical equivalent basis. Aqueous solutions of potassium pentaformate or hexaformate are preferred. The process uses relatively non toxic materials, reduces dry matter loss and accelerates drying.
