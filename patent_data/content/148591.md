# Methods of and apparatus for detecting the presence of a gaseous substance within a space.

## Abstract
A method of and apparatus for detecting the presence of a gaseous substance within a space 12 bounded by an enclosure 10 utilises the fact that sound is not transmitted through a vacuum and is transmitted through the material of the enclosure 10 . A sonic wave transmitter 2 and a sonic wave receiver 4 are engaged with the material of the enclosure 10 and sepa rated by the space 12 . Using calculated arrival times and or amplitudes for soundwave portions travelling through the space 12 and through the material of the enclosure 10 , it can be determined whether a soundwave portion has passed through the space 12 and thus a leakage of gaseous substance into the space 12 above a threshold amount has taken place.
