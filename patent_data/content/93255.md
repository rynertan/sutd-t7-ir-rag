## Description
PREPARATION OF MONO AND DIBROMO OR CHLOROALDEHYDES AND ACID CHLORIDES De Buyck et al., Bull. Soc. Chim. Belg. 89 1980 pp. 441 ff teach the preparation of 2,2 dichloroaldehydes from aldehydes and alcohols by chlorination in dimethylformamide. This reference teaches that induction periods are minimized by the addition of 5 to 10 percent dry hydrogen chloride and that the use of dimethyl formamide as a solvent imparts beneficial stability to the reactants to form the products free of undesirable side reactions. While the process is effective, it has been found that the dimethylformamide, an expensive solvent, could not be reused as the solubility of chlorine was markedly reduced upon completing only one reaction, theDMF recovery was poor and therefor fresh dimethylformamide had to be added. . It has now been found that the same results can be achieved using a catalyst consisting of a complex of a dialkyl or a cycloalkyl formamide and HX where X is a counterion, preferably a counterion of a mineral acid and, most preferably, is C1 or Br. The reaction is generally carried out in the presence of an inert organic solvent containing liquid bromine or chlorine gas and the desired aldehyde or alcohol and bromine or chlorine are added while agitating the reaction mixture. It has further been found that this catalyst can be reused or recovered without any need of regeneration. In addition, it has also been shown that the reaction may be carried out in the product as the solvent without using any other solvent. The preferred catalysts are the DMF HC1 andDMF HBr complexes and they are prepared by sparging HCl or HBr into DMF at any temperature from the melting point to the boiling point of the amide, preferably 40 to 700C. The complex may be used directly or the saturated solution may be allowed to stand an additional 12 to 16 hours or so at ambient temperature to obtain the complex in crystalline form. The crystalline complex may be used directly without further purification. The reaction medium may be two phase or single phase. Inert solvents such as, for example, carbon tetrachloride and tetrachloroethane may be employed, but the product itself is the preferred solvent. The aldehydes and alcohols may be chlorinated or brominated at any temperature from 0 to 800C, preferably 400 to 600C.For converting the product aldehyde to the acid chloride, temperatures in excess of 800C, preferably 900 to 1000C, may be employed. In the process of this invention, side reactions, e.g., aldol condensation, over bromination or chlorination and or oxidation to carboxylic acids and or acid chlorides, are not present and the product may be obtained free of undesirable contaminants by fractional distillation. The brominated or chlorinated aldehydes and acid chlorides prepared by the process of this invention are useful intermediates for the synthesis of halogenated substituted pyridines, herbicides and pharmaceutical monomers. Aldehydes having alpha hydrogens and primary alcohols may be chlorinated by this process. The invention is further illustrated by the following examples.Example 1 Preparation of the DMF HCl complex Dimethylformamide DMF was stirred in a 250 ml three necked round bottomed flask equipped with an HCl inlet tube. HCl was sparged into the DMF at such a rate as to maintain the temperature between 500 and 700C for a period of 30 minutes. Upon completion of the addition, the saturated solution was allowed to react overnight at room temperature. The resulting crystalline complex was used as such without further purification.Example 2 Preparation of l pyrrolidine carboxalde hyde HCl complex 25 Grams g 0.25 mole of 1 pyrrolidine carboxaldehyde was placed in a 100 ml three necked flask and kept at room temperature by means of an ice water bath. HCl gas was passed into the reaction for a period of 7 minutes, during which time the temperature rose to 810C. The reactants solidified and excess HC1 was removed in vacuo to afford 34 g of a white crystalline complex which was used without further purification.Example 3 Preparation of N,N diethylformamide HC1 complex A quantity of 100 g c1.0 mole of N,N diethylformamide was placed in a 250 ml three necked flask in an ice bath. HC1 gas was sparged through the reaction mixture for a period of 25 minutes during which time the temperature rose to 1100C and cooled back to 200C. Upon completion of the addition, the unreacted HC1 was removed in vacuo to afford 135 g of the DEF HC1 complex which was isolated as a pale yellow oil and used without any further purification.Example 4 Preparation of 2,2 dichloropropionaldehyde single phase preparation A quantity of 74 ml of the above preparedDMF HC1 complex was added to a three necked 500 ml flask containing 100 ml of 1,1,2,2 tetrachloroethane and the solution was saturated with chlorine. Propionaldehyde 150 ml was added dropwise to the stirred solution and chlorine addition was maintained in excess such that the temperature was kept between 500 and 700C. An ice bath was kept nearby to control any undesirable exotherms. Upon completion of the addition of propionaldehyde to the reaction, the product was stripped off in vacuo and collected in a dry ice trap.
