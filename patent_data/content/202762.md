## Description
This invention relates to a specific sulfonamide, its agriculturally suitable compositions, and its method of use as a selective pre emergent and or post emergent herbicide. The compound of this invention is generically disclosed in European Patent Application EP A 107,979 which was published May 9, 1984, disclosing herbicidal sulfonylureas of the formula Compound I is also generically disclosed in South African Patent Application 83 5165, published 1 16 84, which discloses herbicidal sulfonamides of formula Despite the broad teachings of these two disclosures, there is still a need for specific compounds which demonstrate selectivity as pre emergent and or post emergent herbicides. According to the instant invention such a compound has unexpectedly been found. The invention relates to the compound of Formula I, its agriculturally suitable compositions, and its method of use as a selective pre emergent and or post emergent herbicide, particularly for use in sugar beets. This compound is 2 butyl N 4,6 dimethoxy pyrimidin 2 yl aminocarbonyl 2,3 dihydro 5 methoxy 1, 2 benzisothiazole 7 sulfonamide, S,S dioxide, m.p. 174 176 C. Three processes for preparing the compound of Formula I are described below preferred reaction conditions are given by way of illustration. The compound of Formula I can be prepared by the method described in Equation 1. The sulfonyl isocyanate of Formula II is reacted with the aminopyrimidine of Formula III in an inert solvent such as dichloromethane, acetonitrile, xylene or chlorobenzene, for a period of 1 to 96 hours at temperatures of 20 to 100 C. The product of Equation 1 can be isolated either by filtration or by evaporation of the reaction solvent and trituration with a solvent such as 1 chlorobutane, ether or similar solvents. The sulfonyl isocyanate of Formula II can be prepared by methods, or modifications thereof, obvious to one skilled in the art as described in U.S. Patent 4,379,769. The compound of Formula I can also be prepared by the method shown in Equation 2 by reacting the sulfonamide of Formula IV with the phenylcarbamate of Formula V in the presence of a molar equivalent of 1,8 diazabicyclo 5.4.0 undec 7 ene. The phenylcarbamate of Formula V can be prepared by the reaction of the aminopyrimidine III with diphenyl carbonate in the presence of a base such as sodium hydride or, alternatively, by the reaction of the aminopyrimidine of Formula III with phenyl chloroformate in the presence of an acid acceptor such as pyridine or triethylamine. Also, the compound of Formula I can be prepared, as shown in Equation 3, by reacting the aminopyrimidine of Formula III with the phenylcarbamate of Formula VI at temperatures of 25 to 100 C in solvents such as dioxane, acetonitrile or tetrahydrofuran for a period of about 1 to 24 hours. The phenylcarbamate of Formula VI can be prepared by reaction of the sulfonamide IV with phenyl chloroformate in the presence of a base such as pyridine or sodium hydroxide. The sulfonamide of Formula IV can be prepared starting with the t butylsulfonamide of Formula VII as shown in Equation 4. The aminopyrimidine of Formula III can be prepared by methods obvious to one skilled in the art. For a review of the syntheses and reactions of 2 aminopyrimidines, see Agriculturally suitable salts of the compound of Formula I are also useful herbicides and can be prepared in a number of ways known to the art. For example, metal salts can be made by contacting the compound of Formula I with a solution of an alkali or alkaline earth metal salt having a sufficiently basic anion e.g., hydroxide, alkoxide or carbonate . Quaternary amine salts can be made by similar techniques. Salts of the compound of Formula I can also be prepared by exchange of one cation for another. Cationic exchange can be effected by direct contact of an aqueous solution of a salt of the compound of Formula I e.g., an alkali metal or quaternary amine salt with a solution containing the cation to be exchanged. This method is most effective when the desired salt containing the exchanged cation is insoluble in water and can be separated by filtration. Exchange may also be effected by passing an aqueous solution of a salt of the compound of Formula I e.g. an alkali metal or quaternary amine salt through a column packed with a cation exchange resin containing the cation to be exchanged for that of the original salt and the desired product is eluted from the column. This method is particularly useful when the desired salt is water soluble. Acid addition salts, useful in this invention, can be obtained by reacting the compound of Formula I with a suitable acid .e.g., The preparation of the compound of this invention is further illustrated by the following examples wherein temperatures are given in degrees Celsius unless otherwise designated.

Useful formulations of the compounds of Formula I can be prepared in conventional ways. They include dusts, granules, pellets, solutions, suspensions, emulsions, wettable powders, emulsifiable concentrates and the like. Many of these may be applied directly. Sprayable formulations can be extended in suitable media and used at spray volumes of from a few liters to several hundred liters per hectare. High strength compositions are primarily used as intermediates for further formulation. The formulations, broadly, contain about 0.1 to 99 by weight of active ingredient s and at least one of a about 0.1 to 20 surfactant s and b about 1 to 99.9 solid or liquid inert diluent s . More specifically, they will contain these ingredients in the following approximate proportions Lower or higher levels of active ingredient can, of course, be present depending on the intended use and the physical properties of the compound. Higher ratios of surfactant to active ingredient are sometimes desirable, and are achieved by incorporation into the formulation or by tank mixing. Typical solid diluents are described in Watkins, The methods of making such compositions are well known. Solutions are prepared by simply mixing the ingredients. Fine solid compositions are made by blending and, usually, grinding as in a hammer or fluid energy mill. Suspensions are prepared by wet milling see, for example, Littler, U.S. Patent 3,060,084 . Granules and pellets may be made by spraying the active material upon preformed granular carriers or by agglomeration techniques. See J. E.

The ingredients are blended, hammer milled until all the solids are essentially under 50 microns, re blended, and packaged. The ingredients are blended, coarsely hammer milled and then air milled to produce particles essentially all below 10 microns in diameter. The product is reblended before packaging. A slurry of wettable powder containing 25 solids is sprayed on the surface of attapulgite granules in a double cone blender. The granules are dried and packaged. The ingredients are blended, hammer milled and then moistened with about 12 water. The mixture is extruded as cylinders about 3 mm diameter which are cut to produce pellets about 3 mm long. These may be used directly after drying, or the dried pellets may be crushed to pass a U.S.S. No. 20 sieve 0.84 mm openings . The granules held on a U.S.S. No. 40 sieve 0.42 mm openings may be packaged for use and the fines recycled. The active ingredient is dissolved in a solvent and the solution is sprayed upon dedusted granules in a double cone blender. After spraying of the solution has been completed, the material is warmed to evaporate the solvent. The material is allowed to cool and then packaged. The ingredients are blended and milled to pass through a 100 mesh screen. This material is then added to a fluid bed granulator, the air flow is adjusted to gently fluidize the material, and a fine spray of water is sprayed onto the fluidized material. The fluidization and spraying are continued until granules of the desired size range are made. The spraying is stopped, but fluidization is continued, optionally with heat, until the water content is reduced to the desired level, generally less than 1 . The material is then discharged, screened to the desired size range, generally 14 100 mesh 1410 1419 microns , and packaged for use. The active ingredient is dissolved in the solvent and the solution is sprayed upon dedusted granules in a double cone blender. After spraying of the solution has been completed, the blender is allowed to run for a short period and then the granules are packaged. The ingredients are blended and ground together in a sand mill to produce particles essentially all under 5 microns in size. The salt is added directly to the water with stirring to produce the solution, which may then be packaged for use. The ingredients are blended and ground in a hammer mill to produce a material essentially all passing a U.S.S. No. 50 screen 0.3 mm opening . The concentrate may be formulated further if necessary. The ingredients are blended and ground in a hammer mill to produce particles essentially all below 100 microns. The material is sifted through a U.S.S. No. 50 screen and then packaged. The ingredients are combined and ground together in a sand mill to produce particles essentially all below 5 microns. The product can be used directly, extended with oils, or emulsified in water. The active ingredient is blended with attapulgite and then passed through a hammer mill to produce particles substantially all below 200 microns. The ground concentrate is then blended with powdered pyrophyllite until homogeneous. The ingredients are ground together in a sand mill until the solid particles have been reduced to under about 5 microns. The resulting thick suspension may be applied directly, but preferably after being extended with oils or emulsified in water. The ingredients are thoroughly blended. After grinding in a hammer mill to produce particles essentially all below 100 microns, the material is reblended and sifted through a U.S.S. No. 50 sieve 0.3 mm opening and packaged. The compound of this invention is particularly useful for the control of weeds in sugar beets and fodder beets. This is a crop that takes a long period to become established. In this interval, the crop seedlings must be nurtured carefully, with particular attention to weed control to prevent damage due to competition. The subject compound can be used either pre or postemergence and will control numerous problem weeds including galium The rate of application for this compound is determined by a number of factors including the weeds to be controlled, weather and climate, soil type, time of application, age and size of crop and weeds, method of application pre or post , etc. In general terms, the rate will vary between about 25 and 250 g ha. The rate to be used in any given situation can be selected by one with ordinary skill in the art. This compound can and will often be used in mixtures with one or more other herbicides. It may be mixed with any other herbicide selective on beets including metamitron, phenmedipham, chloridazin, desmedipham, lenacil, ethofumesate, cycloate, diclofop methyl, fuazifop, haloxyfop and Assure . The selective properties of this compound were discovered in greenhouse tests. The results of these tests are shown in the tables below. Two round pans 25 cm diameter by 12.5 cm deep were filled with Sassafras sandy loam soil. One pan was planted with blackgrass Two round pans 25 cm diameter by 12.5cm deep were filled with Sassafras sandy loam soil. One pan was planted with blackgrass, sugar beets, nutsedge, rape, crabgrass, sicklepod, teaweed, jimsonweed, velvetleaf and giant foxtail. The other pan was planted with wheat, cotton, rice, corn, soybeans, wild oats, cocklebur, morningglory, johnsongrass and barnyardgrass. The two pans were sprayed preemergence with Compound I dissolved in a non phytotoxic solvent. Treated plants and controls were maintained in the greenhouse for 28 days, then all treated plants were compared to controls and visually rated for plant response. Response ratings are based on a scale of 0 to 100 where 0 no effect, and 100 complete control. A dash response means no test. The results are summarized in Table 2. Seeds of the following crops and weeds are sown into 15 cm diameter pots containing Sassafras sandy loam soil wheat Weed control and crop injury are evaluated visually 3 to 4 weeks following compound application , using a scale of 0 to 100 , where 0 no injury or control and 100 complete death of the plants. The ratings represent averages of two tests run under identical conditions and are summarized in Table 3.
