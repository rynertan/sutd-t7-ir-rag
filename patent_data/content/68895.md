# WATER SOFTENER CONTROL

## Abstract
A water softener control includes a cell 29 of sam pling resin 30 which received periodic samples of water which has passed through a major portion of the softening bed 11 . The sampling resin 30 changes volume when it becomes exhausted and the change in volume is employed to initiate regeneration of the softening bed 11 . At the start of the regeneration cycle, regenerative fluid is delivered directly to the sampling resin 30 as well as to the softening bed 11 . The delivery to the sampling resin 30 is through a control valve 60, 70 which is piloted by pressures at a venturi injector 21 which is used to withdraw regenerative fluid from a brine tank 22 . A vacuum operated control valve 75 which is responsive to the closing of an air check valve 25 in the connection between the injector 21 and the brine tank 22 may be employed to positively close the connection from the sampling cell 29 to the injector 21 when the supply of regenerative fluid is exhausted.
