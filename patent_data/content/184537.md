Disclosed is an improved method for controlling mos quitos wherein a body of water containing immature forms of mosquitos has its surface coated with a thin film of a control agent which is a non ionic, organic material with a density less than that of water. The improvement in such method comprises coating the surface with an approximate ly monomolecular film of a beta branched alcohol of the following structure The activity of the beta branched alkanols can be enhanced by forming the alkoxylates thereof.
