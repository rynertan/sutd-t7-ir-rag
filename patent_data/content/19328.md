# Electromagnetic device for focusing and deflecting electron beams.

## Abstract
An electromagnetic device for magnetically focusing and deflecting an electron beam in a television camera tube comprising a vertical deflection coil 11 , a horizontal deflection coil 12 , a ferromagnetic coil 17 and focusing coil 16 . Electrostatic screens 13 and 14 are respectively provided on the inner side of the vertical deflection coil and the outer side of the horizontal deflection coil. In order to prevent or substantially reduce interference signals in the focusing coil 16 from the vertical and horizontal deflection coils, which interference is visible in a signal from a camera tube, the focusing coil comprises multifilar windings 35 and 36 having the same winding direction and sense. The windings 35 and 36 are connected in series such that the magnetic fields produced by each winding are of the same polarity.
