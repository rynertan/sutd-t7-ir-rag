## Description
Apparatus for the exchange of heat by means of channels having a small diameter, and the use of this apparatus in different heating systems. The apparatus relates to an apparatus for the exchange of heat between at least two fluids, which apparatus is provided with channels having d hydraulic diameter of not more than 3 mm, which channels are formed by a wall which is externally provided with a coating.A heat exchanger of the type indicated above is known, int. al., fromGerman Patent Specification 1 601 185, use being made of hollow filaments having an outer diameter of 0,5 to 10 mm. The inner wall, which may for instance be of polypropylene, of the hollow filaments is provided with a coating of metal to obtain a higher resistance to compressive loading. In this known apparatus a long bundle of substantially parallel hollow filaments extend in a housing. The one fluid flows through the filaments and the other fluid flows through the housing around and between the hollow filaments, in such a way as is mainly in conformity with the. operation of a conventional heat exchanger comprising bundles of steel pipes. Although under certain circumstances reasonable results may be obtained with such known heat exchangers comprising hollow filaments, the construction applied is insufficiently reliable because of the relatively high flexibility of the hollow filaments and an unduly high vapour permeability. The known heat exchanger is rather vulnerable, so that there is a chance of leakage and unsatisfactory control of the flow around the hollow filaments, which as the price of energy rises will be more and more considered a disadvantage. Similar drawbacks apply to the heat exchanger described in Canadian Patent Specification 796 181. The invention has for its object to provide a heat exchanger of the type indicated in the opening paragraph which no longer displays the above mentioned disadvantages. The heat exchaner according t o the invention is characterized in the first place in that it comprises at least two groups of channels, the one group being provided with connections for transporting a first fluid and the second group being pro .vided with connections for transporting a second fluid, and each group is formed by a layer consisting of at least 50 channels, in which the centre to centre distarice of successive channels is less than five times and preferably less than twice, the hydraulic diameter of these channels, and the coating, which preferably consists of a metal, such as aluminium, is so impermeable to the fluids that measured at an ambient temperature of 20 C and 20 relative humidity the water vapour permeability of the wall of the channels is less than 1 gramme m2 24 hours. According to the invention each group has preferably of from a few hundred to many thousands of channels, a number of four or more of such layer forming groups of channels being provided. It is preferred, however, that use should be made of constructions comprising a few dozen up to a few hundred or a few thousand layers of channels.As a result, the heat exchanger according to the invention can be constructed in the form of a compact block, which makes it possible for a heat exchanger having a high efficiency to be accomodated in a very small space. The chance of leakage is minimal then and the flow of the two media through the channels allows of optimum control of the through flow. An effective embodiment is characterized according to the invention in that in each filament group the channels extend parallel to each other. According to the invention the channels in each group may extend parallel to the channels in the next layer forming groups. A favourable embodiment according to the invention is characterized in that each group of channels forms a substantially plane surface, the hollow channels in each group crossing the channels in the next layer forming groups, more particularly at an angle of 900. A preferred embodiment of the heat exchanger according to the invention is characterized in that the channels of a group are formed in a layer forming uninterrupted polymer film, to at least one side of which the desired coating is applied. Such an embodiment makes it possible in a simple manner to form as many as, for instance, a few thousand channels. Another embodiment is characterized according to the invention in that the channels of a group are formed by a layer of closely adjacent hollow filaments, said coating being applied to one or both sides of said layer of filaments. With this last mentioned embodiment the space between the hollow filaments may optionally be made to contain a filler, such as a resin. The channels used in the heat exchanger according to the invention have a hydraulic diameter of 0,05 to 3 mm, but preferably of 0,05 to 1 mm.The wall thickness of the hollow filaments is 5 20 of the diameter. It is preferred that the wall thickness should be approximately 10 of the diameter. The heat exchanger is characterized according to the invention in that the channels are formed from one or more of the following substances or mixtures thereof polyolefins, such as polyethylene, polypropylene and polyisobutylene polystyrene and copolymers random, alternating and block . of styrene and butadiene, acrylonitrile and acrylate esters polyhaloolefins, such as polyvinyl chloride and polytetrafluoroethylene polyvinyls, such as polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinyl acetate polyacrylates and polymethacrylates, such as polethylmethacrylaè and polymethylacrylate and other polyacrylates polyacrylonitrile elastomers such as natural rubber, synthetic rubbers, for instance silicone rubbers or polyolefinic rubbers or copolymers of the ethylene propylene rubber type E PD M polyoxides, such as polypropylene oxide and poly 2 , 6 dimethylphenylene oxide saturated and unsaturated polyesters, such as polyethylene terephthalate polyamides, such as nylon 6, nylon 66 and aromatic polyamides polycarbonates polyimides polybenzimidazoles polyurethanes semi synthetic polymers, such as regenerated cellulose, more particularly those.based on copper acetate thermohardening resins, such as epoxy resins and aminoplastics copolymers of two or more of the above mentioned polymers polysulphones inorganic polymers, such as polyphosphazenes. According to the invention the heat exchanger also may be built up of hollow bicomponent filaments, more particularly of the type with an inner ring of the one component and an. outer ring of the other component. According to the invention the channels may be externally provided with a coating to improve the adhesion between successive layers and to reduce permeability, more particularly to reduce vapour permeability. Further, the walls of the channels may contain a filler, stabilizers, carbon black, pigments or like additives. In their simplest embodiment the channels have a substantially circular crosssection.Depending on the requirements to be satisfied, however, they also may have an elliptical, triangular, quadrangular, pentagonal, hexagonal or other polygonal ring shaped cross section.The heat exchanger according to the invention particularly may be advantageously applied in a thermal power system. Because of its compact construction and low weight the heat exchanger according to the invention may with advantage be used in a motor vehicle, particularly as radiator for cooling the cooling liquid, as recuperator in the exhaust system for recovering energy, as heating element for the interior. Favourable results are particularly to be expected when the heat exchanger according to the invention is used in a cooling or heat pump system. An example of such a heat pump system is a system in which heat is withdrawn from subsoil water with the aid of three circulation systems in which pumps and heat exchangers are placed and where of the heat exchangers a high efficiency is required, i.e. an efficiency higher than 90 , and preferably higher than 95 . Also for obtaining high efficiency the heat exchanger according to the invention is with advantage used for exchanging heat between substantially gaseous fluids. To save energy in the heating and conditioning of buildings the heat exchanger according to the invention is with advan tageusedin a system for the recovery of heat from ventilation air. The apparatus according to the invention also may with advantage be used in a system for the storage of heat. The heat exchanger according to the invention also may very well be applied in a system for collecting solar energy, more particulary in a solar collector. The invention is further described with references to the accompanying schematic drawing. For simplicity and illustration the numbers of channels or hollow filaments and layers in the various drawings are far lower than in reality. Figures 1, 2, 3 and 4 show various block shaped heat exchangers according to the invention.Figures 5 and 6 show on a larger scale details of block shaped heat exchangers. Figures 7, 8 and 9 show a few arrangements and connecting alternatives for block shaped heat exchangers according to the invention. Figures 10, 11, 12, 13 14, 15, 16, 17 illustrate some methods of manufacturing hollow filament packages.Figures 18, 19, 20 and 21 illustrate a few variant embodiments of heat exchangers according to the invention.Figures 22 and 23 show a few other embodiments of heat exchangers according to the invention.Figures 24 30 illustrate hollow filaments having different cross sectional shapes.Figures 31 and 32 show cross sections of hollow filaments whose diameters vary in longitudinal direction.Figures 33 and 34 are detail views of a particular type of heat exchanger according to the invention.Figures 35 and 36 show variant embodiments of layers of coated channels. Figure 1 shows a block shaped heat exchanger according to the invention which is generally referred to by the numeral 1 and built up of a number, in the given case thirteen, of successive layers 2 each forming a group of hollow synthetic filaments 3, 4.In Figure 5 the encircled part of the block 1 is represented on an enlarged scale. Each group of filaments forming a layer 2 forms a plane surface. In each layer 2 the hollow filaments 3, 4 run parallel to each other1 but the hollow filaments 3 and 4 of the successive layers cross each other at right angles. The space between the hollow filaments 3, 4 is filled with an casting resin 5 or some other filling material having a good coefficient of heat conductivity. Moreover, the filling material serves to keep the filaments in each layer together and also to bond the successive layers of filaments to each other. The hollow filaments 3 in the one layer serve to transport the one fluid in the direction indicated by the arrows 6 and the hollow filaments 4 in the following layer transport the other fluid in the direction indicated by the arrows 7.The one fluid arrow 6 is for instance supplied in the hot state and the other fluid arrow 7 in the cold state. In the block which intensively operates as a heat exchanger the cold fluid is heated by the hot fluid. The successive layers 2 of the groups of hollow filaments 3 and 4 are each provided with separate feed and discharge connections not shown in Figure 1 for the transportation of two fluids of different temperatures between which heat is to be exchanged. Figure 3 shows an embodiment of a heat exchanger which only differs from the construction according to Figure 1 in that the hollow filaments 4 in the one layer or group have a considerably smaller diameter than the hollow filaments 3 in the next layer or group.Figure 2 shows another block, which is generally referred to by the numeral 8. The block 8 likewise comprises groups of hollow filaments 10 and 11 forming successive layers 9. The hollow filaments 10 and 11 of the successive layers cross each other at right angles. Between every two successive layers of hollow filaments is a separating layer 12. These separating layers may be filled up with a medium which is particularly suitable for the storage of heat.Figure 6 shows the encircled part of the block 8 on an enlarged scale.The space between the hollow filaments is again filled up with a filling material 13 and each layer of filaments has its upper and lower side coated with a foil 14 of metal, for instance aluminium. The block 8 is also to be provided with separate feed and discharge connections not shown for each of the groups of hollow filaments l0 and 11. When the block 8 is to function as heat storage device, the block 8 and more particularly the layers 12 filled with material of a high heat storage capacity may first be heated by a hot first fluid supplied through the groups of hollow filaments 10. At a later stage or at the same time the heat collected in the layers 12 may be given off to a second fluid which can be discharged through the groups of hollow filaments 11. Figure 4 shows a somewhat varied block shaped heat exchanger.Near its top and near its bottom the block 15 contains layers 16 of groups of hollow filaments 17 and 18.The block 15 must be provided with separate feed and discharge connections not shown for each of the groups of hollow filaments 17 and 18, between which there is to be an exchange of heat. The filaments layers 16 near the top and the bottom of the block 15 are separated from each other by an intermediate layer 19. Figure 7 illustrates a block shaped heat exchanger of hollow filaments, with the block 20 being mounted inside a frame 21. The block itself is of the type indicated in Figure 1. The block 20 is made up of eight successive layers 22, which are each built up of layers of parallel hollow filaments 23 and 24, the filaments of every two successive layers crossing each other at right angles. The exchange of heat between two fluids may be effected in a simple manner by feeding and discharging the one fluid along the line 25 and the other fluid along the line 26.Figure 8 shows another embodiment in which a number of heat exchaning blocks 27 are mounted inside a frame 28 and the feed channels 29 and 30 for two different fluids, for instance hot and cold air, respectively, are connected to the blocks 27. The discharge channels for the heated and the cooled fluid are referred to by the numerals 31 and 32.The blocks 27 themselves may again be of the type shown in Figure 1.Figure 9 illustrates another alternative for connecting four heat exchanging blocks 310 destined for exchanging heat between two different fluids. The one fluid flows through the blocks 310 in the direction indicated by the arrows 320 and the other fluid flows through the blocks in the directions indicated by the arrows 330.Figures 10 and 11 show a method of manufacturing a layer or group of hollow filaments. The hollow filaments 34 are each drawn off from supply packages 35 containing, for instance, melt spun, hollow, nylon or polyester filaments. The hollow filaments 34 are suitably guided to run parallel to each other and over guide rolls 36 through a bath 37 of an impregnating agent. After the filaments have left the bath, the impregnating agent, for instance a synthetic resin, will solidify, after which the sheet 38 of parallel hollow filaments 34 is wound onto a reel 39. The sheet of filaments 38 thus obtained can be cut into groups of layer forming parallel hollow filaments which in their turn may be formed into the above described blocks for the heat exchanger according to the invention. Of course, a far larger number of supply packages may be used than indicated in Figure 10. For increased coherence a sheet 40 of parallel hollow filaments may at certain intervals be provided with a transverse connecting thread 41, as is shown in Figure 12. The mat thus formed may be coated with an aluminium foil. Figures 13 17 illustrate a different method of making groups of layer forming, hollow filaments. To this end a frame 42 shown inFig. 13 is rotatably mounted in a support 43. The frame 42 is provided with a suitable drive not shown . A hollow synthetic filament 47 is passed to the frame 42 via a suitable feed system, which comprises guide rollers and tensioning rollers 44 and 45, respectively, and the roll 46. Figure 15 shows the situation in which thehollow filament 47 is wound into a first layer 48. Figure 16 shows the situation in which the hollow filament 47 is wound into a second layer 49, with the frame 42 being turned through 900. Figure 17 shows the frame 42 on which there are wound a few filament layers 48, 49, etc. Such a frame wound with filaments may be impregnated with resin by dipping it in a bath of molten resin.After the resin has set, the package impregnated with it can be cut through along the lines 50 and 51, so that there are obtained a number of parallel layers of groups of hollow filaments, which layers are bonded to each other to form a package. One or more of such packages may be formed into the abovementioned heat exchanger blocks see Figure 1 .Figures 18, 19, 20 and 21 still show a few other embodiments. The elements 70 form sector shaped filament groups and may be assembled in various ways into a unit, as indicated in the Figures 18, 19, 20 and 21. Providing suitable connections for the various fluids in the manner indicated in Figure 21 again leads to obtaining a hollow filament heat exchanger according to the invention. Each fluid then passes through its own group of hollow filaments, the hollow filaments of the successive layers crossing each other.Figures 22 and 23 are respectively a plan view and a perspective view of another variant embodiment of a heat exchanger according to the invention. In Figure 23 six packages 81 are attached to each other to form a kind of block. In the middle thereof, i.e. in the actual block, the hollow filaments of successive layers run parallel to each other. Through the successive layers there alternately flow the one medium and the other, by preference countercurrently to each other, although in principle they also may flow concurrently. Figures 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31 and 32 show different shapes that may be chosen for the cross section of the hollow synthetic filaments. Under some circumstances it may be of advantage to be able to choose from a number of different cross sections.Figure 33 shows part of a heat exchanger according to the invention, the block 82 containing successive layer forming groups of hollow filaments 83 and 84. Figure 34 shows one of the layers 83 separately.The filaments groups 83 are all connected to a common supply channels 86 for a first fluid. Likewise, the groups 84 of hollow filaments are all connected to a common supply channel 87 and a common discharge channel 88. The directions of flow are indicated by arrows. The invention will now be further described in the following two examples.Example 1 A block shaped heat exchanger of the type according to Figures 1 and 7, in which the streams cross each other at an angle of 900, was built up from capillaries of polycarbonate having an internal diameter of 500 pm and a wall thickness of 28 pm. The capillaries coated with aluminium foil were grouped in layers and with the aid of an unsaturated polyester resin they were formed into a block measuring 8x8x100 cm. As a fluid for the two streams air was used. At the inlet of the heat exchanger the temperature of the first stream was 20 0C and the tempera ture of the cold stream 10 C. The volume flows were identical 1,5 m3Xin. At the outlet the temperature of the first stream was found to be 110C and of the second stream 19 C. This corresponds to an efficiency of 90 of the heat exchanger. Per stream the pressure drop across the heat exchanger was found to be 192 Pascal.Example 2 A block shaped heat exchanger of the type according to Figures 1 and 7, in which the streams cross each other at an angle of 900, was built up from a resin and a large number of layers of polyester capillaries coated with aluminium foil and having an internal diameter of 224 pm and a wall thickness of 15 pm. The dimensions of the block were 87x87x60 cm. For the two streams use was made of water having a volume flow of 0,7 m min per stream. At the inlet the temperature of stream 1 was 50 C and of stream 2 it was 30 C. At the outlet the temperature of stream 1 was found to be 31 C and of stream 2 it was 49 C, which corresponds to a heat exchange efficiency of 95 . Per stream the pressure drop across the heat exchanger was found to be 1,85 x 10 Pascal. As mentioned before, the channels in the heat exchanger according to the invention have a low water vapour permeability as a result of the metal coating. The permeability to liquid of the channels is, of course, also low. The heat exchanger according to the invention is therefore suitable for the use in it of various combinations of fluids, such as water air, brine water, freon air, steam brine, etc.Figure 35 is a cross sectional view of a polymer film 400 in which there are formed a large number of channels 401 having an inner diameter of, say, 300 Vm The polymer film is coated on both sides with aluminium foil 402 having a thickness of 0,1 pm. Instead of aluminium it is possible in principle to make use of a coating of a different metal, for instance nickel, copper, chromium or zinc. Such a polymer film 400 provided with channels 401 forms a layer. From a number of such layers the afore described heat exchanger may be built up. The centre to centre distance 403 of the successive chancels is less than five times, and preferably less than twice, the hydraulic diameter of the channels. Said coating may optionally be formed by an alloy or it may have been subjected to an anticorrosive treatment.Figure 36 is a cross sectional view of a layer for composing a heat exchanger in which the channels 401 are formed by the inside of a very large number of adjacent hollow filaments 404. The hollow filaments are covered by aluminium foil 405. The space around and between the hollow filaments 404 and between the hollow filaments and the coatings 405 is filled up with a filler having a thermal coefficient of conduction of at least 0,8 Joule m sec C. It should be added that by the afore mentioned hydraulic diameter is meant D 4.A , where 0 the outer circumference of a wetted surface 7 of a channel through which there is a fluid flow, and A the area of said wetted surface of a channel. So when use is made of channels or hollow filaments having a circular cross section, the diameter D is equal to the hydraulic diameter, so that of channels having an inner diameter of 2 mm the hydraulic diameter is also 2 mm. With channels having a rectangular internal cross section of, for instance, 2 x 5 mm the hydraulic diameter D 2,86 mm. Also other cross sectionai shapes may, of course, be used. United States Patent Specification 3 863 712 describes an apparatus for exchanging heat between two fluids. One of the fluids flows through hollow filaments having an outer diameter of about 2,5 to 6,3 mm.The hollow filaments are formed into small groups which are braided together in such a way that they form a hairpin like tube. US Patent Specification 3 616 022 relates to a process for manufacturing components for heat exchangers comprising synthetic hollow filaments. With the heat exchangers shown in this patent specification the hollow filaments also are formed into a package or block . United States Patent Specification 2 980 404 describes a heat exchanger comprising helicaLly extending channels for a fluid. German Patent Specification 2 414 663 shows a heat exchanger comprising a rotor provided with a large number of conduits extending parallel to the axis of the rotor. These conduits may be formed from various materials, such as cellulose acetate, polyamide, polycarbonate and the like. It should be added that Australian Patent Specification 421 606 also describes a device comprising hollow, helical filaments. In this known device, however, the hollow filaments are permeable and for that reason different uses are proposed for it, more particularly the separation of substances via the permeable wall of the hollow filaments. French Patent Specification 2 339 820 mentions the use in general of hollow synthetic filaments for a solar collector. The hollow filaments may be of glass, metal or a synthetic organic material. The Netherlands Patent Specification 6 514 170 relates to a heat exchanger of hollow synthetic filaments which extend substantially rectilinearly in bundles. Only the one fluid flows through hollow filaments. The other fluid flows through the space formed in the housing around and between the hollow filaments. The Netherlands Patent Specification 7 409 016 describes frames provided with hollow filaments. These frames are first of all destined for uses where the hollow filaments are sufficiently permeable. For use in a heat exchanger these frames are considered less suitable because of the permeability of the hollow filaments. Within the scope of the invention various modifications may be made.
