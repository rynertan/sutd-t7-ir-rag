# Abrasion testing machine.

## Abstract
An abrasion testing machine has a vibrating horizontal platform 15 which supports a six pack of test specimens, such as beverage cans. Hydraulic cylinder controlled press ure plates 39, 40, 57 are applied to the sides of the array of test specimens and to the top of the array as the specimens are vibrated. The amount of pressure is controllable by a control cylinder for each of the pressure cylinders 32, 33, 53 and the speed and magnitude of vibration is adjustable by controlling motor speed and the position of an adjustable linkage between the motor and the platform.
