## Description
PROCESS FOR THE POLYMERIZATION OF POLYESTER CARBONATES This invention relates to a novel process for the polymerization of polyester carbonates by transesteri fiction in the absence of a solvent. BACKGROUND OF THE NVENTON Polyester carbonates are known thermoplastic polymers that have been described in the literature. See for example the Goldberg patents, U.S. Patent Nows. 3,169,121 3,153,008 3,207,814 and 3,030,331,which are incorporated by reference. The methods for making polyestercarbonates that have been employed have been in the presence of a solvent and an amine or in an interfacial aqueous caustic methylene chloride system utilizing triethylamine as a catalyst.Goldberg in U.S. Pat. No. 3,169,121 states that polyestercarbonates may be prepared by reaction of a difunctional acid, a dihydric phenol and a diaryl carbonate under ester exchange conditions. No mention is made of the conditions and no example of an ester exchange reaction is given. The applicants have discovered that polyestercarbonates having good molding properties may be synthesized in a melt polymerization in the absence of a solvent. These polyestercarbonates have excellent hydrolytic stability.The polyestercarbonates that have a high ratio of isophthalate units to terephthalate units have high heat distortion temperatures and are particularly useful in environments where high temperatures are encountered.

They are merely illustrative and are not to be construed to limit the invention in any manner whatsoever. EXAMPLE 1 A three necked, 500 ml round bottomed flask fitted with a one piece Claisen distilling head 30 cmVigreux column, overhead paddle stirrer with vacuum tight bearing and a nitrogen inlet serves as a reaction vessel.The flask is charged with 212 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propane lOOg, 0.439 moles , diphenylcarbonate 28.6g, 0.134 moles , diphenylisophthalate l4.6g, 0.046 moles and diphenylterephthalate 83.0g. 0.26 moles . The flask is then immersed in a 180 C.oil bath and nitrogen flush is begun. When the contents of the flask form a homogenous mixture, the stirrer is started and 0.2 ml of the catalyst solution 184 ms. LiOH . H2O 100 ml R20 is added. via syringe. The temperature of the oil bath is raised as quickly as possible to 2500 C. The nitrogen flow is then stopped and the pressure in the reaction vessel is reduced to axe 100 mm Ag. Phenol begins distilling over at this point. When about 50 ml of phenol is collected, the pressure is reduced to about 10 mm. Hg. This reduced pressure is maintained until about 72 ml. of phenol is removed. The prepolymerization is terminated at this point.The prepolymeri is isolated by admitting nitrogen to the flask and pouring the hot prepolymerization mixture into an aluminum pan. The prepolymer forms a brittle glass intrinsic viscosity IV of about 0.2 dl g as measured in chloroform at 25 C when cooled to room temperature. The prepolymers were converted to high polymers IV in excess of 0.48 dl g as measured in chloroform at 250 C by postpolymerizing them at a temperature of 2900 C. and a pressure of 0.5 mm Hg. for approximately one hour in a test tube apparatus. EXAMPLE 2 The prepolymer is prepared in the same manner as Example 1 except that it is done in a five liter round bottomed flask and the batches were twelve times larger than in the 500 ml. flask. The ratio of the total of diphenyldiacid esters to diphenyl carbonate was 66 34 mole and the ratio in mole of diphenylisophthalate to diphenylterephthalate is 15 85. Term prepolymer is used to designate a relatively low molecular weight polymer. Exact molecular weight is arbitrarily chosen to be sufficiently low to enable convenient pumping and or pouring of molten polymer. Approximately 1600 g. of the prepolymer material is charged to a 4CV 1 gallon Helicone reaccor at 315 C.under 2 nitrogen atmosphere. The blades were started and the pressure reduced as quickly as possible to 0.5 mm Hg.Stirring is continued for approximately 1.5 hours. Vacuum is broken by a nitrogen flush and the material is stranded out the bottom of the reactor. High molecular tight polymer IV 0.48 dl g as measured in chloroform at 250C.is obtained. The polymer is chopped, dried overnight at 125 C.and molded.
