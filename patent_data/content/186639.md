# Biological method of purifying water by holding water in air tight space.

## Abstract
A method of purifying water containing bacteria, at which the water is held in a closed space until the bacteria have used up the nutrients present in the water and died.

## Claims
CLAIM The method of freeing water from aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that the amount of water to be purified is held in an air tight space, at which the aerobic bacteria present in the water consume the oxygen in the air contained in the air tight space, and die in the absence of oxygen, and the anaerobic bacteria die when the nutrients are used up.

## Description
BIOLOGICAL METHOD OF PURIFYING WATER BY HOLDING WATER INAIR TIGHT SPACEThere exist, of old, several known biological methods of purifying water in order to free water from aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, such as boiling, freezing, irradiating and adding chemicals into water. The drawback common to all known methods is the great amount of energy required.The object of this invention is to reduce the amount of energy required.The invention is based on the discovery that the aerobic bacteria present in the water that is held in an air tight space consume the oxygen in the air dissolved in the available amount of water, and die in the absence of oxygen. Analogously, anaerobic bacteria die when the nutrients are used up.
