# Ultrasonic apparatus, particularly for liquid processing.

## Abstract
The apparatus comprises a periodic wave generating unit driving at least a piezoelectric transducer 10 for generating ultrasounds, which latter includes a base block 12 associated with a passage conduit and wherewith there are associated a plurality of piezoelectric buttons or pads 20 interposed between different polarity electric contacts 21, 22 electrically coupled to the generating unit and clamped against the base block 11 by means of a counter block 25 .
