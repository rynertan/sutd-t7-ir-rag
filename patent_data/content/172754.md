# Color correction circuit.

## Abstract
A color correction circuit is disclosed, which includes three video signal lines for supplying red, green and blue singals, respectively, a first circuit for detecting a white color component, a circuit for applying the red, green and blue signals to the first detecting circuit, a second circuit for detecting a predetermined color component, a circuit for applying at least two signals of the red, green and blue signals to the second detecting circuit, a circuit for producing a difference signal between output signals of the first and second detecting circuits and a circuit for controlling at least one of the red, green and blue signals according to the difference signal.
