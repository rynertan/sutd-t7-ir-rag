# Reactivation of steam deactivated catalysts.

## Abstract
A process is provided for reactivating a catalyst com position comprising a crystalline zeolite material having a silicon aluminum atomic ratio of at least about 2, said catalyst composition having been deactivated by contact with steam. The process involves contacting the steam deactivated catalyst composition with an aluminum com pound at elevated temperature, and thereafter contacting the aluminum compound treated catalyst composition with an aqueous acid solution.
