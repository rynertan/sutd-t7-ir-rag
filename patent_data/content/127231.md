# Optical element comprising a transparent substrate and an anti reflection coating for the near infrared region of wavelengths.

## Abstract
An optical element is described which comprises a trans parent substrate and, on this substrate, an antireflection coat ing for the range of wavelengths from approximately 700 nm to approximately 1700 nm, which coating comprises a plural ity of uniform layers with a refractive index which decreases towards the outside, and an underlying basic coating. The effective refractive index at the top of the basic coating is at least 2.5 and the basic coating comprises a graded index layer.
