## Description
This invention relates to a method of fabricating an MOS integrated circuit device comprising the steps of forming a gate oxide layer on a monocrystalline silicon body, forming a polysilicon layer over the gate oxide layer, forming a metallic silicide layer over the polysilicon layer, and ion implanting doped regions in said monocrystalline silicon body. In one MOS integrated circuit device design of practical importance, a multilayer polysilicon metallic silicide gate level metallization structure is patterned to form gates and associated interconnects. Some of the interconnects are designed to make contact with ohmic regions in the single crystalline body of the device. The polysilicon in the gate level metallization is doped in a high temperature diffusion step to render the polysilicon conductive. At the same time, ohmic contacts are thereby formed in the single crystalline body of the device. Advantageously, a layer of a metallic silicide is subsequently formed on the doped polysilicon thereby to provide an especially low resistance gate level metallization. In one particular procedure the body of the device is made of silicon and the specified dopant comprises phosphorus. Due to the relatively high diffusivity of phosphorus in silicon, two ohmic contacts in the body of such a device cannot in practice be located less than about two micrometers apart. This of course imposes a limitation on the degree of integration achievable in the device. In a specific alternative procedure for making MOS integrated circuit devices, arsenic is utilized to dope the polysilicon of the device in a first ion implantation step. A metallic silicide layer is then formed on the polysilicon. The silicide and the underlying polysilicon are then patterned. Next, in a second arsenic implant, dopants are introduced into the source and drain regions of the device. Subsequently, during a heating cycle in which the source and drain regions are exactly defined, the patterned polysilicon is rendered conductive and small size ohmic contacts are formed in the body of the device. The aforespecified alternative procedure is an attractive one for making MOS integrated circuit devices. But the procedure does require two separate ion implantation steps, which steps are relatively time consuming and expensive. Moreover, the requirement of making two implants increases the probability that the characteristics of the gate oxide layer included in the device may be deleteriously affected. EP A 0 051 500 discloses a process in which a metallic silicide layer doped with phosphorus is deposited on a polysilicon layer. Arsenic impurities are then ion implanted into the substrate to form source and drain regions. In a subsequent heat treatment the phosphorus impurities diffuse into the polysilicon. In the invention as claimed the introduction of the dopant into the silicide and into selected regions of the monocrystalline silicon body is provided by a single ion implantation step. In the drawing FIGS. 1 through 6 are schematic cross sectional depictions, not drawn to scale, at various steps in a device fabrication procedure carried out in accordance with the principles of the present invention. A portion of a partially fabricated MOS integrated circuit device is schematically depicted in FIG. 1. For purposes of a specific illustrative example, the depicted device is assumed to be a part of a very large scale integrated circuit formed on a semiconductive body that comprises a p type region 10 made of single crystalline silicon. Thus, the particular illustrative structure to be described herein can be considered to be an n channel MOS NMOS integrated circuit device or a part of a complementary MOS CMOS integrated circuit device. The specific illustrative FIG. 1 device includes conventional field oxide portions 12, 14 and gate oxide portions l6, 18. Each of these portions is made of silicon dioxide that was formed in a standard thermal oxidation step. Illustratively, the portions 12, 14 are each approximately 400 nm thick, and the portions 16, 18 are each about 25nm thick. Additionally, the device includes portions 20, 22 made of undoped polycrystalline silicon formed in a low pressure chemical vapor deposition LPCVD step in a manner known in the art. By way of example, the portions 20, 22 are each approximately 150 nm thick. The purpose of the depicted polysilicon is to protect underlying gate oxide from contamination and erosion during subsequent lithography in which window region 24 is patterned. In a prior step of the fabrication sequence utilized to form the FIG. 1 device, the polysilicon and silicon dioxide layers thereof were etched to form window region 24. Illustratively, this was priorly done in a conventional two step reactive sputter or ion etching process in which a plasma derived from chlorine was employed to anisotropically etch the polysilicon and a plasma derived from trifluoromethane and ammonia was utilized to anisotropically etch the silicon dioxide. Next, in a standard LPCVD step, a layer of undoped polysilicon approximately 250 nm thick is deposited on the surface of the FIG. 1 device. The resulting structure, including newly deposited polysilicon layer 26, is shown in FIG. 2. A portion of the layer 26 in the window region 24 will later, when suitably doped in accordance with a feature of applicants inventive procedure, be rendered conductive. This conductive portion will constitute a polysilicon contact polycon for establishing electrical contact to an ohmic region to be formed in the region 10 underlying the polycon. It is known to utilize a refractory metal silicide on polysilicon to achieve a high conductivity gate level metallization for MOS devices. Specific examples of such silicide on polysilicon composite structures are described in U.S. Patent No. 4,276,557, issued to H. J. Levinstein, S. P. Murarka and A. K. Sinha. Additional details concerning the use of silicide on polysilicon composites in MOS devices are contained in an article by S. P. Murarka et al entitled Refractory Silicides of Titanium and Tantalum for Low Resistivity Gates and Interconnects, In accordance with the principles of the present invention, a metallic silicide, for example tantalum silicide or cobalt silicide, is included in the device described herein. For purposes of a specific illustrative example, emphasis herein will be directed to a particular MOS device that includes a layer of tantalum silicide formed on the polysilicon layer 26 shown in FIG. 2. In accordance with a known technique, a layer 28 of tantalum and silicon is co sputter deposited on the polysilicon layer 26, as indicated in FIG. 3. Illustratively, the layer 28 is approximately 250 nm thick. Thereafter, by standard lithographic procedures, a resist pattern is formed on the layer 28. Resist elements 30, 32 of such a pattern are represented in FIG. 4. By way of example, each of the elements 30, 32 is approximately. two micrometers thick and one micrometer wide. In the next steps of applicants inventive fabrication sequence, the resist elements 30, 32 are utilized as an etch resistant mask for anisotropically patterning the underlying layers 28, 26 and 20. Portions of these layers directly underlying the element 30 will constitute the gate electrode of the herein considered MOS device. Portions of the layers 28, 26 directly underlying the element 32 will constitute a conductivity enhanced polycon region of the device. Patterning of the tantalum silicon layer 28 included in the FIG. 4 device is carried out, for example, in a reactive sputter etching step by utilizing a plasma containing active etchant fluorine constituents. A suitable such plasma is derived from The aforedescribed remaining portions of the tantalum silicon layer 28 are then sintered. This is carried out, for example, in a pure argon atmosphere at about 900 degrees Celsius for approximately one half hour. This converts the remaining portions of the layer 28 to tantalum silicide. As a result of the two step etching procedure and sintering step, the MOS device being fabricated comprises tantalum silicide portions 34, 36 and polysillcon portions 38, 40, 42, as shown in FIG. 5. In accordance with the principles of the present invention, the device of FIG. 5 is then subjected to bombardment in an ion implantation step. This is schematically represented in FIG. 5 wherein arrows indicate that the entire top surface of the device is subjected to an incident ion beam. As will be described below, this step provides the basis for forming source, drain and ohmic contact regions in the body 10 and conductive polysilicon regions overlying the body 10. Illustratively, in the implantation step represented in FIG. 5, arsenic dopant ions at an energy of about 60 kilo electron volts and at a dosage of approximately 7x10ยนโต ions per square centimeter are directed at the indicated device. Selected surface portions of the body 10 are thereby implanted with arsenic ions, as schematically indicated by dots in those portions. Additionally, the silicide portions 34, 36 are implanted with arsenic ions, as also depicted by dots. Arsenic ions do not, however, pass through the silicide portions 34, 36 into the underlying polysilicon portions 38, 40, 42. Further, surface portions of the body 10 underlying the field oxide portions 12, 14 have no ions implanted therein. Nor do surface portions of the body 10 directly underlying the silicide portion 34, 36 have ions implanted therein. By way of example, the shallow implanted portions in the body 10 extend about 30 nm below the top surface of the body 10. Next, a relatively thick insulating layer a so called intermediate dielectric is formed on the entire top surface of the MOS device. Such a layer 46 is shown in FIG. 6. Illustratively, the layer 46 is approximately 1.5 micrometers thick. Advantageously, the layer 46 is formed in a standard CVD step from a source comprising tetraethylorthosilicate and triethyl phosphite. The resulting conventional material is commonly referred to as PTEOS glass, which exhibits good step coverage. Illustratively, the MOS device including the PTEOS glass layer 46 FIG. 6 is later processed in a standard fashion in a gettering cycle. Gettering is one of the last steps in the fabrication sequence. It typically occurs long after windows, described below, are formed in the layer 46. Gettering is done, for example, in a phosphorus rich atmosphere at a temperature of approximately 900 to 950 degrees Celsius for about one hour. As a result of this later heating step, which occurs normally anyway even in typical prior art fabrication sequences, arsenic ions previously implanted in shallow surface portions of the body 10 are activated and driven into the body vertically and laterally to form n In accordance with the principles of the present invention, arsenic dopant ions in the silicide portions 34, 36 are driven therefrom during the aforespecified standard heating step into the underlying polysilicon portions 38, 40, 42 to render those portions conductive. Moreover, sufficient quantities of the dopant ions formerly in the silicide portion 36 are also thereby driven through the polysilicon portion 42 into a surface region 52 of the body 10 to conductively bridge the regions 50. It has been found that, unlike other metals or metal compounds, metal silicide has a network of grain boundaries which permit impurity diffusion to the underlying polysilicon. As a consequence of the aforespecified heating step which, illustratively, actually occurs later during gettering, as mentioned above , the formation in the FIG. 6 device of a composite high conductivity silicide portion 34 on polysilicon portions 38, 40 gate electrode is completed. At the same time, source and drain n In further standard steps, contact windows are etched through specified portions of the glass layer 46 FIG. 6 to access preselected surface regions of the silicide portions 34, 36. A suitable contact material is then deposited on the entire top surface of the layer 46 and in the aforespecified windows formed in the layer 46. Advantageously, the contact material comprises a two layer composite of aluminum on doped polysilicon. Thereafter, the aluminum polysilicon composite is selectively etched in a conventional way to form a specified interconnection pattern. Further standard steps well known in the art are then employed to complete the fabrication of the hereindescribed MOS device.
