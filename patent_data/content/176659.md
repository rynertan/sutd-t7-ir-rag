# Capacitance membrane switch.

## Abstract
A capacitance membrane switch 1 of the type including a a variable capacitor defined by a first capacitor plate 64 on a flexible film layer 60 and a second capacitor plate 52 on a dielectric film layer 50 with an air gap therebetween, and b a fixed capacitor defined by the second capacitor plate 52 and a third capacitor plate spaced therefrom by the dielectric film layer 50 , characterized in that the third capacitor plate consists of conductive adhesive 47 bonded to the dielectric film layer 50 on a surface 59 thereof opposite from the second capacitor plate 52 .
