## Description
COMPLETE, INTEGRATED LIQUID FEED FOR LIVESTOCK USEThis invention relates to a complete, integrated storage stable liquid feed for livestock use comprising nutrient substances of animal and vegetable origin dissolved or dispersed in aqueous liquid. In livestock farms for meat and milk production, cattle feeding costs are known to generally exceed 50 of the total production cost. For economical farm management it is therefore obviously important to provide a low cost feed which at the same time ensures best farm performance. The fundamental requirement in this respect is that the nutrients contained in it are balanced.Balanced solid feeds are known which are able to satisfy the feeding requirements of the various animal species, and are obtained from various raw materials of vegetable and or animal origin.In order to possess good storage stability, such solid feeds must have a low water content. This requires drying the raw materials and or mixture, an operation which weighs heavily on the cost of this type of feed.Liquid feeds mainly of vegetable origin are also known, these sometimes comprising low cost by products either in single form molasses or compound form for example molasses plus protein concentrate, molasses plus soluble maize extracts . These liquid feeds, which do not require drying of the components, have the advantage of a very low production cost. On the other hand, the known products of this type have drawbacks from the food aspect in that they are unbalanced, and in particular those based on by products of the sugar industry have a high potassium salt content which limits the amount which can be administered daily to the animals. In practice, with this type of feed it is not possible to administer more than 2 kg day per head of cattle, in that higher quantities give rise to health problems which negatively affect the overall yield of the farm in terms of meat and milk.Consequently the use of liquid feeds d known type is integrated with substantial quantities of solid feeds, of considerably higher cost.The object of the present invention is to provide a complete, ie multi component feed which is integrated and comprises additives, and is prepared from raw materials of vegetable and animal origin, its mineral salt content, and in particular potassium salt content being such as to in no way limit the quantity which can be administered daily to animals, the feed being in the form of a homogeneous liquid.An essential requirement of this product is high storage stability at ambient temperatures ranging from very low 200C to very high 500C for long periods of more than six months and up to more than one year.The liquid feed according to the invention is constituted substantially by a homogeneous, stable aqueous dispersion comprising various nutrient substances ofJ vegetable and animal origin, of a type either soluble or insoluble in water, and present in quantities which are proportioned in such a manner as to obtain a complete balanced feed non ionic surface active agents of dispersing and solubilising action able to homogeneously disperse the water insoluble components in the aqueous liquid anti fermenting agents compatible with the food use of the product, consisting of organic acids able to create acidity conditions such as to inhibit fermentation reactions and mould development, and also able to provide a bacterial effect antioxidants able to inhibit degradation of the nutrients by oxidation by atmospheric oxygen.They are choses from known antioxidants compatible with the food use of the product antifreezing agents for maintaining the product liquid at temperatures less than OOC. They are chosen from those known agents compatible with the food use of the product, such as glycerol, glycol, polyethylene glycols flavourings able to give the product a taste pleasant to cattle.A further additive which is very useful in many cases is constituted by thickening agents for the aqueous liquid which improve the storage stability of the aqueous dispersion by preventing the sedimentation of solid products and incrustations, and which can also adjust the viscosity of the final product to optimum standard values even though this uses raw materials which have a consistency and physical characteristics which vary within wide limits.The feed according to the present invention is integrated by adding vitamins and mineral salts in optimum quantities and proportions. A very advantageous integrating additive for this type of feed is a metabolically active preparation obtained from yeasts and available commercially under the brand name THEPAX of the present applicant.By virtue of the specific additives contained in it, the feed according to the invention enables the following substances to be used as raw materials with nutrient properties a Raw materials of vegetable origin molasses of various origins sugarbeet, sugar cane, citrus fruits by products of molasses processing distillation, fermentation yeasts by products of beer processing by products of vegetable fat processing extracted or pressed juices of vegetable products by products of cereal fermentation by products Qfn fruit juice preparation, vegetable concentrate preparation and vegetable distillation protein residues of enzymatic fermentation b Raw materials of animal origin by products of meat processing by products of fish processing by products of hide processing by products of feather processing by products of animal viscus processing blood acid or sweet milk whey The nutritive raw materials used in the product according to the invention are selected in order to obtain a feed of high nourishing content. In particular as raw nutritive materials are preferred molasses in an amount corresponding to at least 15 by weight of the total dry substances in the final product and liquid by products of molasses processes in amount corresponding to at least 30 by w.of the total dry substances, the total amount of both ingredients being at least 50 by w.The product according to the invention may contains little amount of fat substances, lower than 2 by w.The said raw materials have already been at least partly used in solid feeds. However in such cases they do not represent economically convenient products as the removal of water from said waste materials an an expensive operation. According to the present invention a stable liquid feed is obtained without necessity of total removal of water from the raw starting material in fact it is possible to obtain a final product containing up to 50 by w. of water.Because of the fact that the feed according to the invention uses nutrient substances of various types and of both animal and vegetable origin which are very different from each other, and easily subject particularly those of animal origin to degradation and fermentation in an aqueous environment, the choice of stabilisers and antioxidants is important in obtaining a product with the characteristics according to the invention.Suitable antioxidants can be chosen from L ascorbic acid, including its sodium or calcium salt acetyl 5,6 L ascorbic acid palmityl 6 L ascorbic acid natural extracts rich in tocopherol tocopherols in general octyl, dodecyl or propyl gallate butyloxyanisole butyloxytoluene ethoxyquinStabilisers of antifermenting action can be chosen from formic, acetic, propionic, lactic, sorbic, fumaric, tartaric, citric benzoic or phosphoric acid, possibly in the form of their salts alkylesters of.p.hydroxybenzoic acid formaldehydeAnother technical problem solved by the present invention is that of providing a homogeneous, fluid, water based mixture free from the tendency to form deposits of solid substances or to unmix into separate liquid phases, while using as raw materials substances which are very different from each other in terms of specific gravity and aggregation state, and some of which are insoluble in water or even of hydrophobic nature fats .Another important requirement is high wetting power which allows easy mixing and homogenisation with the other components of the overall feeding ration, which can be of various origins and different in terms of form and consistency.These objectives have been attained according to the present invention by using specific non ionic surface active agents which provide a dispersing and emulsifying action and are compatible with food use, and also by the use of suitable thickening agents which prevent solids sedimenting in a non resuspendable form and also enable optimum standard viscosity values to be obtained, even when the characteristics of the raw materials used vary.Proper surface active agents for the product of the invention are non toxic, assimilable substances oS the class of derivatives of fatty acids, compatible with food use, compresed in the following substances mono, di or triesters of sorbitol with fatty acids compatible with food use, such as lauric, palmitic, stearic and oleic acid esters of fatty acids with polyoxyethylene sorbitol. The fatty acids can for example be oleic, stearic, palmitic or lauric acid.The commercial product Tween 80 is an example monoesters of foodstuff fatty acids with propylene glycol, possibly in mixture with esters mono and diglycerides of foodstuff fatty acids acetic, lactic, citric, monoacetyltartaric and diacetyltartaric ester of mono and diglycerides of foodstuff fatty acids sucroglycerides mixture of sucresters, esters of monosaccharides with fatty acids, and of mono and diglycerides of foodstuff fatty acids non polymerised polyglyceride esters of foodstuff fatty acids stearyl 2 lactyl acid sodium stearoyl lactyl 2 lactate calcium stearoyl lactyl 2 lactate glycerol polyethyleneglycolether ricinoleate polyethyleneglycol esters of soy oil fatty acids polyglycerol ethers with alcohols obtained by reducing oleic and palmitic acids.The thickening agents suitable for preparing the feed according to the invention can be chosen from those compatible with food use, namely lecithins alginic acids and their sodium, potassium, calcium and ammonium salts esters of alginic acids and propylene glycol Agar Agar carrageen, carrageenates carob seed meal tamarind seed meal guar seed meal guar gum tragacanth gum arabic pectins methyl cellulose ethylcellulose hydroxypropylcellulose carboxymethylcellulose as such or as its sodium saltThe flavourings for use in preparing the feed according to the present invention are chosen from those of natural or synthetic origin compatible with food use, as allowed by the current foodstuff regulation.By virtue of its physical consistency, viscosity and specific gravity characteristics and the additives contained therein, the feed according to the present invention can be easily transferred by positive displacement pumps and metered by metering pumps. It is also easily miscible with other normal feeds by virtue of its high wetting power. The liquid feed according to the present invention can be obtained with a high dry substance content and thus with high nutrient power per unit of weight. Products of excellent characteristics are obtained having a water content of between 35 and 50 by weight.The following example is given for illustrative purposes only, and is not to be considered as limitative of the implementation of the invention.EXAMPLEThe basic nutrients used in the present example are a protein effluent deriving from the processing of meat hydrolysed at low temperature composition as such water 40 , proteins 46 , ash 13 , 28 parts by weight b concentrated sugar cane or sugarbeet molasses pulp with its potassium removed indicative composition water 42 , proteins 21 , ash 10 , 40 parts by weight c sugar cane or sugarbeet molasses indicative composition water 18 , proteins 6 , ash 9 , 30 parts by weightThe mixing procedure was carried out in 4 stages in accordance with the method and sequence indicated hQreinafter.
