# AN IMPROVED FOUNTAIN SOLUTION

## Abstract
An improved fountain solution suitable for use in a lithographic offset printing press which solution contains from about 0.5 to about 10 percent by volume of an isopropanol replacement, and between 0.005 and about 1 percent by weight of a water soluble miscible polymer selected from hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellu lose, methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, hyd roxybutyl methylcellulose, poly ethylene oxide , poly acry lamide , poly vinyl alcohol , guar gums, acid thickening polymers and chemically modified gums. The fountain solution provides increased viscosity over current fountain solutions which results in improved operating latitude and decrease of problems associated with isopropanol replace ments.
