## Description
This invention relates to immunohematology procedures, and more particularly to a reagent system and a method for the identification of classes as well as subclasses within a class and enumeration of cells within those subclasses of blood leukocytes from a whole blood sample which has been incubated with a fluorescent responsive antibody to a select antigenic determinant on the surface of specified subclasses of blood leukocytes. It is known that the lymphocyte population of blood leukocytes is subdivided into a number of subclasses which play distinct roles in the immune response. In disease states the relative number of lymphocytes found in various subclasses is likely to change. Hence, the enumeration and identification of the cells in the various subclasses will provide useful information in the study and treatment of disease as described by James R. Downing et al in Laboratory Management, May 1984, pages 29 37. It is known that several particular subclasses of functionally distinct lymphocytes and other blood leukocytes can be identified on the basis of antigenic determinants on the cell. Monoclonal antibody techniques have been utilized to produce large quantities of highly purified antibody to various lymphocyte and other leukocyte subclasses. Utilizing such antibodies, it has proved feasible to assay the lymphocytes of an individual to determine the relative number of cells in various subclasses. Further, utilizing direct or indirect techniques, the antibodies can be labeled fluorescently, thereby rendering the samples under consideration amenable to flow cytometric analysis and morphology. More recently, additional monoclonal antibodies have been developed which include several that react with monocytes and granulocytes. Hansen et al describe in U. S. Pat. 4,284,412, 1981, and in Immunology, Vol. 77, No. 8, pp 4914 4917 1980 a method and apparatus for automated identification and enumeration of specified lymphocyte subclasses. An anticoagulated whole blood sample or buffy coat sample is incubated with an antibody to a specific lymphocyte subclass of interest. The binding of this antibody is detectable if either it has been coupled with a fluorescent chemical moiety the direct technique , or if it in turn is specifically bound by another macromolecule to which has been coupled a fluorescent dye moiety the indirect technique . These fluorescent moieties possess the characteristic of emitting fluorescent light upon illumination with incident laser light. The sample then is lysed using ammonium chloride as the lysing agent. and centrifuged, obtaining a pellet containing leukocytes, residual platelets, and erythrocyte ghosts. The pellet is washed and treated with a fluorescent labeled antibody indirect technique . A diluted sample then is subjected to flow cytofluorometric analysis. Four clusters of cells are distinguished. However, only three clusters are found to be due to leukocytes. These clusters were identified as 1 lymphocytes, 2 monocytes and 3 granulocytes. The fourth cluster is identified as aggregates or multiples of platelets and red blood cell debris due to incomplete lysing of the red blood cells. The lysing techniques described in these references now have been improved by the present invention so as to maintain better the morphology of the immunologically labeled specific leukocytes, improve their stability on storage, and render them more suitable for cytofluorescent analysis, or for other operations such as microscopic examination of stained cells on a slide. Employed herein are the trademarks COULTER, COULTER CLONE, ISOTON, E.A.SY.l, MDADS and EPICS which are owned by Coulter Corporation, Coulter Electronics, Inc., or Coulter Electronics, Ltd. The present invention provides a process for identifying classes and preferably also selected subclasses of leukocytes in whole blood, the process comprising By way of example, illustrative embodiments of the invention now will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings by which This invention relates to an improved reagent system and method for identifying classes and enumerating the cells in selected subclasses within those classes of leukocytes in whole blood, based on utilization of antigenic determinants on the cell surface and their reactivity with labeled antibodies. This invention employs somewhat the general overall procedure described by Hansen et al, but with improvements especially over the conventional lysing and cell fixing procedure. According to the present invention, the reagent system comprises aqueous solutions of A a lysing reagent containing saponin, and B a fixing reagent containing a cross linking agent. The improved reagent system lyses the blood erythrocytes, while maintaining the physical and morphological properties of the blood leukocyte classes, as well as labeling specific leukocyte subclasses. The samples can be analyzed either by the principles of flow cytometry, or by microscopic morphology. Using saponin as the lysing agent, the method permits fixation with a limited amount of a cross linking fixative. This is accomplished by lysing at room temperature, or preferably at an elevated temperature, such as 42 C, which selectively destabilizes the erythrocyte membrane and accelerates the lysing reaction. The use of a hypotonic buffer, consisting primarily of potassium salts, also favors lysis. Glyoxal is preferred over glutaraldehyde as the cross linking agent, even though the latter is a stronger fixative because glyoxal, after reacting with a leukocyte, imparts minimal, if any, background fluorescence whereas glutaraldehyde produces a significant amount of fluorescence. Dialdehydes are preferred over monoaldehydes, such as formaldehyde, which have only a weak cross linking action for this purpose. The addition of dimethyl sulfoxide or urea to the fixative improves the reaction, and tends to decrease the amount of fixative required to retard the action of the saponin on the leukocytes. In addition, a temperature drop to approximately 4 C as by use of an ice bath slows down the reaction. The cells are weakly fixed and can be sufficiently spread on a slide for cytological preparation. In copending U. S. Application, S.N. 615,966, filed the same day as the present application, a somewhat analogous lysing method is described, but such method does not include immunological techniques for utilizing antigenic determinants on the cell surface and their reactivity with antibodies that label cells which fluoresce under known circumstances. This invention concerns a method for identifying classes and enumerating cells in subclasses of leukocytes in whole blood, based on the utilization of antigenic determinants on the cell surface and their reactivity with labeled antibodies, followed by utilization of the principles of flow cytometry or microscopic morphology to identify the cells which have been labeled. Employed herein are the terms lysis , or forms thereof, and morphology . Lysis of the erythrocytes means to render the erythrocytes such that they no longer are detectable by physical techniques, or the erythrocyte residue is such that the signals they generate are sufficiently decreased that they will not interfere with those produced by the blood leukocytes. Morphology means the process of microscopic examination of cells and the determination of their classes and subclasses by either human or artificial intelligence techniques. According to this invention, a whole blood sample is incubated with diluted monoclonal antibody to label certain subclasses of leukocytes. The erythrocytes then are removed by lysis, and the leukocytes are stabilized by use of a cross linking fixative, prior to the class and subclass identification. It is preferable to lyse the red blood cells before the steps of identifying the class and subclasses of leukocytes, to avoid the danger that coincident passage of two or more erythrocytes or fragments thereof through counting transducer could be mistaken for white blood cells. A preferred procedure is to lyse the red blood cells prior to the identification of the leukocytes by addition of a lysing reagent to the suspension of cells so as to cause the red blood cells to rupture and release their hemoglobin content into the solution. The problem is to lyse the red blood cells without damage to the antigen antibody complexes on the leukocytes, while preserving their cell morphology and producing a stable cellular suspension. The whole blood sample must be treated in a way that lyses the red blood cells, and at the save time the leukocyte blood cells are maintained in a condition which allows measurements to differentiate them and their subclasses. The lysing reagent needs to act quickly, preferably in less than one minute. The cytogram produced should have the cluster of aggregates or multiplets of platelets, and red cell debris separate from the leukocyte clusters. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the whole blood sample is incubated with a fluorochromed antibody to label a specific subclass of leukocytes. The erythrocytes are selectively lysed with a lysing reagent containing saponin, and the directly labeled leukocytes are then fixed, using a fixing reagent containing a dialdehyde. The leukocyte cell suspension then is analyzed by the combination of forward angle and right angle light scattering to yield data representing at least three classes. The positively immunofluorescent leukocyte populations are enumerated with a COULTER EPICS flow cytometer. The fixative is a cross linking or bifunctional fixative, preferably a dialdehyde. Successful results have been obtained with the following COULTER CLONE antibodies T4 FITC, T8 FITC, T11, T11 FITC, B1 FITC and Mo2 FITC. Other antibodies useful for this purpose would include OKT1.PAN, OKT4.IND, and also OKM1.M G, which reacts with monocytes and granulocytes. As used herein fluorescent responsive antibody refers to antibodies which themselves fluoresce, or antibodies which are labeled to fluoresce under specified stimulation. A technique has been developed to lyse the blood erythrocytes, while maintaining the physical properties and morphology of the blood leukocytes, and immunologically labeling specific leukocyte subclasses. This technique is unique in that it does not involve centrifugation yet, it does preserve the cells sufficiently so that they can be stored at 4 C for a day and still be usable for flow analysis. Using this technique, it is possible, for example, to divide T lymphocytes into 1 helper lymphocytes, using COULTER CLONE T4 FITC monoclonal antibody, and 2 suppressor lymphocytes, using COULTER CLONE T8 FITC monoclonal antibody. The cells prepared by the techniques of this invention also are suitable for other cytological preparations, for instance by centrifugal cytology. The technique of this invention minimizes the concentration of the saponin lysing reagent required, and consequently permits fixation with a limited amount of fixative. Lysing is accomplished at room temperature, or preferably at an elevated temperature such as 42 C, which selectively destabilizes the erythrocyte membrane and accelerates the lysing reaction. The use of a hypotonic buffer, consisting primarily of potassium salts, also favors lysis. It has been found that the amount of saponin employed under comparable conditions of lysis can be decreased as the temperature is increased. Thus, the residual amount of saponin in preparations that are not centrifuged can be minimized by increasing the temperature of the lysing reagent. Bifunctional or cross linking fixing agents such as glyoxal, glutaraldehyde, carbodiimide, succinaldehyde, Mirsky s reagent, and the like, are suitable for use in the fixing reagent. Mirsky s reagent consists primarily of an impure preparation of glyoxal derived from the chemical treatment of saccharides. Glyoxal is especially preferred in the fixing reagent, because it does not fluoresce. This is an advantage when determining the fluorescence of the antibody binding cells later on in the procedure. The invention is not limited to fluorescence measurements, but absorbance measurement can be performed such as is described in Defined Immunofluorescence and Related Cytochemical Methods by D. Y. Mason, Z. Abdulaziz and B. Falini, Annuals of the New York Academy of Science, Vol. 420, pages 127 138 1983 . The technique of this invention can be employed with the additional physical measurements of DC and AC impedence. The measurements can be utilized in conjunction with the aforementioned light scattering measurements, or in place of them. The fixed blood cells are stable when stored cold at about 2 to 4 C prior to the light scattering procedure. A laboratory study established that samples were stable for 24 hours post lyse. For example, using COULTER CLONE antibody T8 FITC, the percent positive cells was 20.3 1.0 immediately after sample preparation, 20.3 0.6 after 20 hours post lyse, and 20.0 0.3 at 24 hours post lyse. Centrifugation and removal of the supernatant fluid between processing steps is beneficial in that it significantly decreases cell debris, and removes excess loosely bound antibody. However, centrifugation has the disadvantage that it virtually precludes obtaining an absolute count of the cells present, and under some conditions can result in selective cell loss. Although centrifugation can be part of a semiautomated system, it introduces considerable complexity into a completely automated system. One of the major constraints in the development of the present reagent system is that sample preparation for a flow cytometer, such as an EPICS system, unlike that for a standard hematology analyzer, such as the COULTER Model S series instrument, is asynchronous. The time between the final sample preparation and measurement can range from almost immediately to the next day. One other problem is the choice of a suitable control. The exquisite specificity of monoclonal antibodies in some cases for example, when fluoresceinated mouse immunoglobulin G mouse IgG FITC is used as a control, leads to an over estimation of background fluorescence. Either a preincubation and or a simultaneous incubation with unlabeled antibody blocks the nonspecific binding sites, and this in many cases can eliminate the need for a control. Samples containing antibody prepared according to this invention are capable of being prepared employing Romanowsky stain. It is also possible in the case of fluorescent studies to stain the cell with two stains, such as dichlorofluorescin and 4,6 diamino 2 phenylindole DAPI . Other conventional stains include Mithromycin and Acridine Orange. The examples which follow illustrate certain of the methods and procedures followed in the invention. Sample Analysis The samples are analyzed with the COULTER EPICS V single laser, flow cytometer system. The system configuration is set up as herein explained. The laser emits 500 mw of 488 nm radiation. the preferred filter configuration is a 515 interference acting as a blocking filter for green fluorescence, 488 nm dichroic mirror and an NDl filter for orthogonal light scatter, and a NDl filter for forward angle light scatter. The data are analyzed with a computer system, such as in the COULTER MDADS or E.A.SY.l . The three parameters measured are log fluorescence, low angle light scatter and log right angle light scatter. This analysis procedure also is utilized for each of the following Examples. At this point in time the whole blood has been labeled with monoclonal antibody₃ lysed and then fixed. It is now ready for analysis with the EPICS flow cytometer. Filtration of the sample, preferably through a 37 micron mesh, is desirable. The samples are stabilized at approximately 2 C on ice, if need be, for at least 5 minutes prior to sample analysis. Analysis is as stated at the end of Example 1. In accordance with the above procedure, but substituting for the COULTER CLONE monoclonal T4 FITC of Example 1, any one of the following COULTER CLONE monoclonal antibodies T8 FITC T11 FITC B1 FITC Mo2 FITC similar results are obtained. In each instance the leukocyte subclass which is labeled is the leukocyte which is specific for the antibody employed. At this point in time the whole blood has been labeled with monoclonal antibody, lysed and then fixed. It is ready for analysis with the EPICS flow cytometer. Filtration of the sample, preferably through a 37 micron mesh, is desirable. The samples are stabilized on ice, if need be, for at least 5 minutes prior to sample analysis, and analyzed as stated at the end of Example 1. At this point in time the whole blood has been labeled with monoclonal antibody, lysed and then fixed. It is ready for analysis with the EPICS flow cytometer. Filtration of the sample, preferably through a 37 micron mesh, is desirable. The samples are stabilized on ice, if need be, for at least 5 minutes prior to sample analysis and analyzed as stated at the end of Example 1. At this point in time the whole blood has been labeled with monoclonal antibody, lysed and then fixed. It now is ready for analysis with the EPICS flow cytometer equipped with the COULTER CVA, employing the principles proposed for the AMAC III, R. C. Leif et al, Clinical Chemistry 23, 1492 8 1977 and R. A. Thomas et al, J. Histochemistry and Cytochemistry, Vol. 25, No. 77, pp 827 835 1977 . The designator COULTER CVA represents cell volume accessory and, in quite simple terms, means that the electronic cell analysis equipment utilizing the well known Coulter principle of particle detection has been utilized and integrated into a flow cytometer. Such multiparameter instrument has been demonstrated commercially. Filtration of the sample, preferably through a 37 micron mesh, is essential. The samples are stabilized on ice, if need be, for at least 5 minutes prior to sample analysis. The parameters measured were forward angle light scattering, right angle light scattering, fluorescein immunofluorescence and electronic cell volume. At this point in time the whole blood has been labeled with monoclonal antibody, lysed and then fixed. It is ready for analysis with the EPICS flow cytometer. Filtration of the sample, preferably through a 37 micron mesh, is desirable. The samples are stabilized on ice, if need be, for at least five minutes prior to sample analysis and analyzed as stated in Example 1. As can be seen from the preceding examples, the relative volumes of the blood sample 50 to 100 ul, the lysing reagent 100 to 1000 ul, and the fixative 500 to 1000 ul can vary. The lysing reagent 0.24 to 4 g L and fixative concentrations 0.66 g L to 40 g L are inversely related to their volumes and must be scaled up as the volume of all previously added reagents is increased. The quantity of saponin 0.24 to 4.0 g L also is inversely related to both the temperature 24 C to 60 C and the period for lysis 38 seconds to 5 minutes. The quantity of fixative also is related to whether the sample is to be stored for a prolonged period or used immediately for morphology. For the long term storage, maximum fixation is essential, but for the near immediate use, minimal fixation often is preferable. It is understood that the illustrative embodiments set forth herein constitute examples of the principles of the present invention, but that numerous alternatives will occur to those of ordinary skill in the art, without departure from the scope of this invention.
