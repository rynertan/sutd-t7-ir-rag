# PROCEDURE FOR TAKING AND CORRECTING DENTAL IMPRESSIONS BY MEANS OF ALGINATE BASED MATERIALS

## Abstract
When alginate based materials are used, in order to obtain a sufficient adhesion between the material which constitutes the second impression and the material which constitutes the first impression, conditions are determined in the materials for the impressions, able to activate, with the retarder of the second impression material, the functional groups blocked by the calcium of the first impression material, so that bonds between the two materials of the two impressions are established.
