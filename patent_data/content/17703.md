## Description
This invention relates to novel copolymerizable ultraviolet light absorber compounds, and, more particularly, to 2 cyano 3,3 diphenylacryloxy alkylene compounds which are copolymerizable with vinyl monomers to provide polymer materials having improved resistance to degradation to light. Various organic compounds exhibit the power to absorb electromagnetic radiation and can be incorporated in various plastic materials such as transparent sheets which act as filters for all the radiation passing through and will transmit only such radiations as are not absorbed by the sheet and or the absorbing agent. Such filters find use in many technical and commercial applications. Numerous cyano acrylic compounds have been suggested as absorbents for the range of radiations described above. For specific compounds, see U.S. Patents 3,081,280 3,272,810 3,644,466 3,256,312 and 3,215,724. These ultra violet absorbers are mechanically mixed with the plastic materials to prevent discoloration and degradation of the material. However, it has been observed that such absorbers sometimes fail or are blocked out of the plastic under adverse weather conditions before the lifetime of the protected material. Also, it is not possible to use all of these ultra violet absorbers with radiation curing of the plastic material. Another disadvantage of these ultraviolet absorbers is the high amount of absorber needed for protection of some materials. What is provided herein are improved, novel compolymerizable ultra violet light absorber compounds of the formula EMI1.1 where Ar l and Ar 2 are arciatic carbocyclic nuclei of the benzene and naphthalene series and are independently selected from phenyl or phenyl substituted with alkyl, halo, alkoxy, carboxy, carbalkoxy, cyano, acetyl, benzoyl, phenyl, alkyl phenyl, phenoxy phenyl, alkyl substituted phenoxy, or alkoxy phenyl substituted phenyl and naphthyl X ir alkylene, C2 C17, unsubstituted or substituted with halo, cyano, alkyl, alkoxy, alkoxyalkyl or alkoxyalkyleneoxy, C1 C6 y is a copolymerizable radical selected from acryloyl, alkylacryloyl, acryloxyalkyl, acryloxyhydroxyalkyl and alkylacryloxyhydroxyalkyl, C3C12 or RC CHR , where R is alkylene, oxyalkylene, alkyleneoxyalkylene, phenylene, C1 C10 instituted or substituted with hydroxy, and R and R are independently hydrogen or alkyl, C1 C6. In other aspects of the invention, it relates to methods of making these compounds and to intermediates formed during their synti is. Suitable Ar l and Ar 2 groups are given in U. S. 3,644,466, including representative starting benzophenone eo pounds. The x groups are unsubstituted or substituted alkylene radicals, C2 C17. The preferred groups are unrubstitut d lower alkylene, C2 C6, which are derived synthetically fros ethylene glycol, propyl glycol, butanediol, and the like. the y radical is compolymerizable with vingl monomers so that the ultraviolet absorber becomas an integral part of the polymer.Suitable Y groups are derived fros acryloyl, alkylacryloyl, acryloxyalkyl, acryloxyhydroxyalkyl and alkylacryloxyhydroxyalkyl, C3 C12. These groups include acryloyl, methacryloyl, glycidyl acryloyl and glycidyl methacryloxyl, 3 acryloxy 2 hydroxypropyl and 3 methacryloxy 2 hydroxypropyl. Other Y groups include RCR CHR , where R is alkylene, oxyalkylene, alkyleneoxyalkylene, phenylene, C1 C10, unsubstituted or substituted with hydroxy, and R and R are independently hydrogen or alkyl, C1 C10. Suitable radicals include allyl, methylpropenyl, crotyl, ethylpropenyl, vinylbenzyl, vinyloxyethyl, allyloxy 2 hydroxypropyl and 2 hydroxy 3 butenyl. The compounds of the invention contain ultraviolet light absorber and copolymerizable portions in the samm molecule. These portions are effectively separated by the X radical so that each can perform its own function without interference from the other.Therefore, the absorber portion does not inhibit the copolymerization, and the Y radical does not affect the light absorbing properties of the molecule. The novel compounds of the invention may be prepared by esterification of 2 hydroxyalkyl 2 cyano 3, 3 diphenyl acrylate with an acyrloyl halids or acrylic acid Method 1 or by direct knoeven gel condensation of a benzophenone with an acryloxyalkyl cyanoacetate Method 2 , or alkylation with an ethylenic halide. In Method 1, the hydroxy group of a hydroxyalkyl cyano acetate first is protected by acylation with r group convertible by hydrolysis to the hydroxy compound, e.g. with acetyl chloride. to provide the corresponding acetoxyalkyl cyanoacetate. The protected compound then is condensed with a benzophenone in a Knoevenagel raction to provide the acetoxyalkyl 2 cyano 3, 3 diphenyl acrylate in good yield. Subsequent acid hydrolysis of the protecting acetic group affords the corresponding hydroxy intermediate, which is thm directly esterified with a suitable acryloyl halide or acrylic acid to give the desired compounds. This method is summarized below EMI4.1 Method I Continued EMI5.1 Method 1 Continued EMI6.1 Method 1 Continued where Z is a halide or hydroxyl, and X and Y and R, R and R are as defined above. Typical X groups are CH2CH2, CH2CH2CH2 , CH2CH2CH2CH2 , and the like.Representative Y groups areEMI7.1 acryloyl ,EMI7.2 methacryloyl ,EMI7.3 3 acryloxy2 hydroxypropyl , andEMI7.4 3 methacryloxy 2hydroxypropyl . Representative RCR CHR radicals are CH2 CH CH2 allyl , CH CHCH3 crotyl ,EMI7.5 2 methyl l propenyl ,EMI7.6 vinylbenzyl , CH2 CH2OCH CH2 vinyloxyethyl ,EMI7.7 3 allyloxy 2 hydroxypropyl , andEMI7.8 2 hydroxy 3 butenyl . In step a of Method 1, cyanoacetic acid is reacted with a lower dihydric alcohol to form a hydroxyalkyl cyanoacetate, as described in U.S. 3,644,466, Example 3, cols. 7 8. In step b , the hydroxy group of the hydroxyalkyl cyanoacetate then is protected by acylation, suitable with acetic anhydride, to give the corresponding acetoxyalkyl cyanoacetate. Step c in the process involves a Knoevenagel condensation of a benzophenone with the aceotxyalkyl cyanoacetate. The Knoevenagel reaction is generally run in the presence of a solvent, such as benzene, toluene, or ethylenedichloride, under reflux, usually at a temperature between 800 and 100 C. for about 24 hours. The reaction preferably proceeds in a nitrogen atmosphere and in the presence of glacial acetic acid and ammonium acetate as a catalyst. Conventional washings of the product with water and saturated bicarbonate solution are done prior to the drying, removing the solvent and recovering the product. The fourth step d in the synthesis is to rescve the protecting acetyl group by acid hydrolysis in alcohol to provide the corresponding free hydroxyalkyl compound. This step is carried out in ethanol under acid conditions at reflux temperatures. The final step e in Method 1 may involve esterification with z reactive acryloyl co pound, such as an acryloyl halide e.g. acryloyl chloride or acryloyl bromide. The reaction is carried out in an inert solvent, suitably an acetic or aliphatic hydrocarbon or halogenated hydrocarbon, such as toluene, benzene, chloroform or ethylene dichloride. or in acetone, at a suitable tenperature, generally ranging from room temperature to the reflux temperature of the solvent, e.g. if chloroform, at about 61 C., and in the presence of a base, such as sodiun bicarbonate, to absorb the acid by product of the reaction. Suitably the molar ratios of the reactants are controlled to provide at least a 1 1 molar ratio of the acryloyl halide to the hydroxyalkyl 2 cyano 3,3 diphenyl acrylate. Preferably an excess of the acryloyl chloride is used. The reaction is run for about 1 5 hours at the reflux temperature. The yield of product in step c in Method 1 is about 80 90 . An acrylic acid may be used in place of an acryloyl chloride in step e . In this embodiment, water is distilled out of the reaction mixture as an azeotrope with the solvent. Preferably, an inhibitor, such as phenothiazine or methoxyphenol, is included in the reaction mixture in an amount of about 200 1000 pp. to prevent polymerization of the acrylic acid reactant. The reaction with acrylic acid generally is run at a somewhat higher teiperature than with the acryloyl chloride, usually at about 80 110 C, for about 10 to about 10 to about 20 hours.The yields are about 60 70 . The final step e may involve alkylation with a reactive ethylenic compound, such as an ethylenic halide e.g. alkyl chloride or allyl bromide. The reaction is carried out in an inert solvent, suitably an aromatic or aliphatic hydrocarbon or ether hydrocarbon, such as, toluene, benzene, tetranydrofuran, dioxane or ethylene dichloride, at a suitable temperature, generally ranging fros raci temperature to the reflux tesperature of the solvent, e.g. if tetrahydrofuran, at about 66 C, and in the presence of a base, such as sodium hydride, the reactants are contolled to provide at least a 1 1 molar ratio of the ethylenic halide to the hydroxyalkyl 2 cyano 3,3diphenyl acrylate. The reaction is run for about 1 6 hours at the reflux temperature. In Method 2, a hydroxyalkyl cyanoacetate is reacted first with an acryloyl chloride or acrylic acid to form a 2 acryloxyalkyl 2cyanoacetate intermediate. Then the intermediate is condensed directly with a benzophenone in the Knoevenagel reaction to form the desired compounds, as follows Method 2EMI9.1 where Y may be the group RCR CHR ,EMI10.1 where X, Y Z and R, R and R are as defined above. The reaction conditions in steps a and b of Method 2Comrrespond generally to tho described in steps e and c of Method 1, respectively. The compounds of the invention say be copoly erized, for example, with a urethane oligomer, by radiation curing, to provide useful polymmric coatings.
