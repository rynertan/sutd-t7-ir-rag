# Semiconductor device including a diode and a bipolar transistor.

## Abstract
A semiconductor device including a diode and a bipolar transistor which are connected to each other and formed in isolated area 3 of a semiconductor layer has a diffusion region 10 formed between a base region 6 of the bipolar transistor and a formation region 7 of the diode and lying across the isolated area. The diffused region has the same conductivity type as that of the base region, so that a PNPN diode effect does not occur.
