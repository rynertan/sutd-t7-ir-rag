# Air flow meter assembly.

## Abstract
An air flow meter for detecting the air flow sup plied to an internal combustion engine. The air flow meter has a hot wire 13 disposed in a by pass air pas sage 8 opening at its one end to a portion of an air passage 2 upstream from a venturi portion 3 formed in said air passage 2 and at its other end in the venturi portion 3 . The by pass air passage 8 is provided to prolong a distance of length between the inlet opening of the by pass passage 8 and the hot wire 13 , thereby to settle the flow of air in the by pass passage 8 at least in the area around the hot vire 13 . The inlet open ing of the by pass air passage 8 may open in a plane perpendicular to the axis of the venturi portion 3 and within the area of upper projection of the venturi portion, to prevent carbon and oil particles from coming into the by pass passage 8 thereby to prevent the contamination of the hot wire 13 .
