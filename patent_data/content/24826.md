# Input torque control system for a variable displacement pump.

## Abstract
The pump 10 is provided with a compensating valve 14 comprising a valve body 15 formed with a bore 18 and having an inlet 34 , a first port 102 , a second port 104 , a valve sleeve 19 movable within the bore 18 and a valve spool 20 movable within the valve sleeve 19 , the valve sleeve 19 and the valve spool 20 being biassed in opposite directions by means of respective springs 21,22 . The outlet of the pump 10 is connected to the inlet 34 , the first port 102 communicates with a chamber 100 formed in the body of the pump 10 , and the second port 104 is a low pressure vent. A pump displacement control cylinder 12 has a piston 29 which is subject at one end 29a to the fluid pressure within chamber 100 , and at its other end determines the adjustment of a displacement control cam 11 which controls the displacement setting of the pump 10 . The said one end 29a of the piston 29 is shaped as a conical cam surface, and a pin 25 extends from this cam surface, through a bore 28 in a spacer block 17 which separates the pump housing 13 from the compensating valve housing 15 , and into contact with an arm 23b of a pivotal lever 23 . The lever 23 has another arm 23a engaged with the valve sleeve 19 and a third arm 23c which cooperates with an adjustable pressure limit stop 26 . As the hydraulic load on the pump 10 varies, so the pump outlet pressure varies which results in a corres ponding movement of the valve spool 20 to either admit pressurized fluid from the pump output to the chamber 100 or to vent chamber 100 to port 104 in each case with a corresponding adjustment of the pump capacity via piston 29 and cam 11 . For each adjustment, a corresponding adjustment of valve sleeve 19 is effected via the coupling between sleeve 19 and piston 29 via pin 25 and lever 23 .
