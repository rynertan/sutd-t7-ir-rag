## Description
BLEND OF GRAFT COPOLYMER AND POLYVINYL CHLORIDE RESIN This invention relates to a blend of graft copolymer and polyvinyl chloride resin. Various blends of polyvinyl chloride resin and graft copolymer have previously been proposed. Thus, U.S. patent 4,251,645,Humme et al., Feb. 17, 81, is concerned with molding compositions having high impact strength comprising from 20 to 99 parts of polyvinyl chloride resin and from 1 to 80 parts of a graft copolymer produced by solution polymerization above 80 C of certain resinforming monomers e.g. styrene acrylonitrile on an EPDM rubber spine. U.S. patent 3,489,821, Witt and Paddock, January 13, 1970, mentions blends of 30 97 parts of PVC resin with 70 3 parts of a gum plastic blend of a styrene acrylonitrile resin and b graft copolymer of styrene and acrylonitrile on ethylene propylene rubber. Plasdoc Abstract 10062X 06 of Japanese patent 50088 167,Hitachi, July 15, 1975, discloses graft copolymer blends with PVC resin in 2 50 98 50 ratio. Also of interest are the following Plasdoc Abstract 55728V 21 of Japanese patent 49002848, Showa Denko,January 11, 1974 Plasdoc Abstract 30922X 17 of Japanese patent 5102854, Sumitomo Chemical, March 11, 1976 French patent 2,145,845, Solvay U.S. Patents 3,641,207, Lauchlan, Feb. 8, 1977, and 4,054,615, Bayer, Aug. 18, 1977, and Roofing Siding Insulation magazine, page 12, October, 1980. The present invention is directed to various improved blends that are remarkable for their flame retardant properties. In anoth er aspect, the invention provides blends having high impact strength. The invention contemplates mixtures of 10 to 90 frequently 10 to 50 by weight of PVC polyvinyl chloride resin and corres pondingly 90 to 10 frequently 90 to 50 of graft copolymer com position as hereinafter defined. These compositions may contain an effective amount of a flame retardant agent, e.g., a metallic flame retarding agent, and or halogen containing flame retarding agent, such as an antimony or tin compound or the like, notably antimony oxide. Suitable halogen containing flame retardants include other halogen containing polymers such as chlorinated polyethylene, chlorinated polyvinyl chloride or small molecule materials such asPyro Check 77B trademark , Firemaster 680 trademark , tetrabromobisphenol A, and the like.Usually a small amount of flame retardant is sufficient, e.g. 5 to 10 parts per 100 parts by weight of graft copolymer plus PVC, although larger amounts such as 20 parts or more may be used if desired. In blends containing low amounts of PVC i.e., toward the 10 PVC end of the range the amount of antimony oxide or the like is usually of the order of 10 parts. As the PVC content is increased the amount of antimony oxide or other flame retardant may be decreased, until the high side of the range of PVC content 50 or more of PVC is neared, where the antimony oxide content may decrease to zero.Thus, in the absence of antimony oxide the following flame out times are typical PVC 0 50 85 100 AES 100 50 15 0F.O.T.,sec. 5 10 1 2 0.5The flame out time, F.O.T. , is the time that the sample remains lit after removing the ignition source in the Underwriters Laboratories UL 94 verkcal test thickness 1 16 . In the first sample 08 PVC, 100 AES the flame does not go out the sample is totally consumed. A preferred flame resistant composition contains 15 25 PVC, 85 75 of the graft copolymer composition and 8 15 parts of flame retardant, e.g., antimony oxide, per 100 parts of polymers. It is preferred that the composition of the invention have a flame out time of less than 30 seconds, more preferably less than 10 seconds, and most preferably not more than 5 seconds. The graft copolymer composition employed in the foregoing blends may be referred to as AES and is ordinarily based on a graft copolymer of resin forming monomeric material especially such monomers as vinyl aromatics, alkenoic nitriles, esters, or acids, or mixtures thereof, e.g., a mixture of styrene and acrylonitrile on an olefin copolymer rubber spine, whether a saturated ethylene propylene rubber EPM or an unsaturated terpolymer EPDM containing a suitable diene, especially a non conjugated diene, as in rubbery terpolymers of ethylene1 propylene, and dicyclopentadiene, ethylidene norbornene, hexadiene, or the like. In the preparation of such a graft copolymer, much of the resin forming monomers become chemically grafted to the rubbery spine, but a certain amount of ungrafted resin Is also formed i.e., grafting efficiency is not 100 .In a preferred practice, additional separately prepared resin Is blended with the product of the graft polymerization step. Typically, separately prepared styrene acrylonitrile resin SAN is blended with the product of graft polymerization of styrene and acrylonitrile on EPDM. However, it is also possible to make all of the resinous portion in situ during the graft polymerization. In either case the entire final SAN EPDM product may be referred to as AES. In preferred flame retardant blends of the invention, the EPDM content of the product of thewJgraft copolymerization step is from 35 to 60 , preferably 50 , the EPDM content of the AES after blending in separately prepared resin is 15 to 30rut,, preferably 23 , and theEPDM content of the final total AES PVC blend is from 7.5 to 27 , preferably 18 , based on the total weight of polymers. The invention also provides blends that are remarkable for their high impact strength, compared to PVC resin alone. In this form of the invention, referred to as impact modified PVC, the PVC content ranges from 75 to 90 , preferably 8596, while the AES ranges from 25 to 10 , preferably 15 the EPDM content of the product of the graft polymerization step is 40 to 65 , perferably 50 . It is not necessary to blend in additional separately prepared SAN resin. The EPDM content of the final AES PVC blend is from 4 to 16 , preferably 7.5 . The AES component of the blend of the invention is preferably prepared by blending two separate components, namely A a graft copolymer of styrene and acrylonitrile on EPDM rubber, particularly ethylene propylene 5 ethylidene 2 norbornene terpolymer rubber and B separately prepared styrene acrylonitrile resin. Examples of the graft copolymer component A and the separately prepared resin component B are described in more detail in U.S. Patent 4,202,948, Peascoe, May 13, 1980. The preferred graft copolymer A is prepared by graft copolymerizing a styrene and acrylonitrile in weight ratio of 80 20 to 65 35 on b a rubbery terpolymer of ethylene, propylene and 5 ethylidene 2 norbornene in which the weight ratio of ethylene to propylene is within the range of from 80 20 to 20 80. The Mooney viscosity of the terpolymer rubber b is preferably from 40 to 78 ML 4 at 2570F and the iodine number of the rubber b preferably is from 15 to 40. The amount of a acrylonitrile styrene is about 50 based on the weight of a plus b . The preferred separately prepared resin B is a copolymer of styrene and acrylonitrile in weight ratio of 80 20 to 65 35 having an intrinsic viscosity in dimethylfornamide at 300C of at least 0.4.The amount of resin B in the AES is sufficient to provide an over all ratio of resin to rubber in the range from 80 20 to 75 25.The addition of separately prepared resin B is generally employed in the flame retardant blends containing 50 or less of PVC, but is unnecessary in the impact modified PVC blends containing 75 or more of PVC. In a particularly valuable form of the invention, an ar. ioxidant is present during the graft copolymerization stage. If the AES portion of the blend contains both components A the graft copolymer and B the separately prepared resir. , these components A and B are sheared or masticated together at elevated fluxing temperature, for example in a twin screw type of extruder blender, prior to blending with the PVC resin to provide the blend of the invention. Blending of the AES and PVC can be carried out in conventional plastic mixing equipment, e.g., extruder, Banburw trademark , etc., at an elevated temperature sufficient to flux the mixture. One way to provide the AES PVC blend is by reworking scrap or rejects or similar recycled material that is a composite ofPVC and AES, for example a laminate having a layer of PVC and a layer of AES. Additional AES and or PVC may be added to such re worked laminate material if necessary to bring the ratio ofPVC AES into the desired range. The addition of PVC to AES extends the usefulness of AES into areas where both the recognized strengths of AES weather resistance, high impact strength, ease of processing, attractive cost performance balance, etc. and the flame resistance provided by the PVC are required. Unexpectedly, the resulting blends not only combine the most desirable features of both polymers, but also provide an increase in impact strength further extending the usefulness of AES based polymers. The addition of relatively low levels of AES can be used to correct one of the major deficiencies of PVC poor impact strength . Due to the excellent weatherability of the AES, the weather resistance of the PVC is not impaired by the addition of the AES. The EPDM portion of the AES serves as a weatherable impact modifier, while the grafted SAN greatly improves the compatibility between the EPDM and the PVC. Inspection of Table I below and the graph of impact data therein shows that the impact strength increases, goes through a maximum and then declines as the concentration of AES either graft copolymer alone or graft copolymer plus separately prepared SAN resin in the blend is increased. The intermediate points unexpectedly provide excep tionally good balances of impact strength and hardness.The graph of impact strength notched Izod at room temperature versus EPDM content in blends of AES and PVC shows an unexpected increase in impact strength when compared to the theoretical dotted line relationship.
