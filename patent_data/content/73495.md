# Method and apparatus for measuring a workpiece.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for measuring a workpiece W mounted on the table of a numerical controlled machine by us ing a numerical control device and a detector 1, 1a which pro duces a detecting signal when it is brought into contact or out of contact with the workpiece W . White the machine is mov ing for detection, if there is a delay in a signal transmitting sys tem, then coordinates of a point to which the machine has overshot will be read. Such an error becomes greater as the feeding speed of the machine increases. Therefore, the feed ing speed of the machine needs to be made as slow as possi ble in order to attain a high accuracy of measurement. There is a method and apparatus to overcome this problem in accord ance with the present invention, driving the detector 1, 1a with three different speeds towards the correspondent posi tion.
