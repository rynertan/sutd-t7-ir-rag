# Thread texturising nozzle.

## Abstract
A texturising nozzle for synthetic filaments is openable and closable to facilitate lacing up. The nozzle comprises a two part carrier structure with the parts 10 , 12 movable towards and away from each other to open and close the nozzle. The thread path though the nozzle is defined by means of insert elements 18 , 20 releasably mounted on the carrier structure at least in that region of the path in which the main texturising step is performed. A thread infeed passage 24 and a preferably single fluid infeed passage bring thread and treatment fluid together at a junction location, and a guide passage 26 which preferably widens in the downstream direction leads the thread and fluid from the junction location to the texturising region 28 .
