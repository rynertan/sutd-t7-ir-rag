# Package forming apparatus.

## Abstract
A package forming apparatus comprises a pushing member 16 which is capable of being inserted into a core member 3 to form the bottom of a package by folding an end portion of the sheet material wound on the core member is driven by a driving mechanism. The driving mechanism comprises a slidable shaft 9 provided on a rotary drum 2 for movement in axial direction thereof, an arm member 17 having one end secured to one end of the sliding shaft, a socket member 18 having an intermediate portion rotatably supported at the other end of the arm 21 member, a crank arm having one end secured to one end of the socket, the other end of the extension shaft being secured to the other end of the socket member and coupling member 32 for snap coupling together the arm member and crank arm at a predetermined rotational position. Thus, the pushing mem ber may be movable between the position where it faces with the core member and the position where it does not face the same.
