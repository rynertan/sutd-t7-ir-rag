## Description
ALPUAPIlOSPIlATO ANIDE COMPOUNDS AND LUBRICANT AND HYDROCARBON FUEL COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING THEM TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to alpha phosphato amide compounds which are useful as antiwear additives for lubricant compositions and liquid hydrocarbon fuels. Alpha dithiophosphato amides and alpha thiophosphato amides herein containing sulfur at the alpha position are also useful as extreme pressure additives for lubricants, while the non sulfur containing alpha phosphato amides and alpha thiophosphato amides herein containing oxygen at the alpha position are also useful as friction reducing additives for lubricants and fuels.The compounds are non corrosive and effective at relatively low concentrations when compared with common phosphorus based additives. BACKGROUND ART U.S. U.S. Patent 2,973,380, Swern, issued February 28, 1961, discloses alpha phosphono acid ester plasticizer compounds. In the form of partially hydrolyzed alpha dialkylphosphono carboxylic acids, the compounds are said to be useful in making lubricant greases. U.S. Patent 2,185,541, Cahn, issued January 2, 1940, describes a wide variety of alpha substituted carboxylic acids as interface modifying agents. The hydrophilic group at the alpha position generally is an oxygenated sulfur or phosphorus group, and can be phosphonic acid. The patent also states that the carboxyl group of the acid can be esterified or converted to an amide. U.S. Patent 2,363,510, Farrington et al., issued November 28, 1944, discloses alpha , beta and gamma substituted carboxylate salts as non corrosive detergent additives for lubricants. The substituents must contain either nitrogen, phosphorus, arsenic, antimony or bismuth, and can be phospho and phosphonato groups. U.S. Patent 3,830,685, Petersen, issued August 20, 1974, discloses certain dialkyl carbarnyiphosphonates useful as intermediates in the preparation of dialkyl N,N dialkoxymethyl carbamylphosphonate flameproofing additives. German Patent 27 56 488, Schmidt et al., published June 29, 1978, discloses dithiophosphato acid and amide compounds which are said to be useful as non corrosive, extreme pressure additives for lubricants. Zinc dialkyl dithiophosphates are commonly used in lubricants as antiwear additives, antioxidants and, to a lesser degree, as extreme pressure additives. However, since these compounds do not reduce friction between moving surfaces, and can even increase friction under certain conditions, lubricants containing them often also require special additives to minimize energy losses due to friction. In order to reduce friction and thereby improve fuel efficiency, crankcase lubricants have recently been prepared using low viscosity base oils. However, current antiwear additives do not provide adequate wear protection in such low viscosity oils. New antiwear additives which provide lower phosphorus levels than the zinc dialkyl dithiophosphates are also needed for crankcase lubricants in order to reduce phosphorus poisoning of catalytic converters and other emission control equipment.Finally, more effective additives for liQuid hydrocarbon fuels are needed to reduce wear and friction in fuel pumps and the upper cylinders of internal combustion engines. While some alpha phosphono carboxylic acids and esters known in the art could provide antiwear and friction reducing benefits in lubricants and fuels, it has been found that they are generally too corrosive to be used in such compositions. Thus, there is a continuing need for the development of improved antiwear additives for lubricants and fuels. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention encompasses compounds of the formulaEMI2.1 wherein each X is S or O R1 is a C6 C2รป hydrocarbyl group each R2 is hydrogen or a C1 C12 hydrocarbyl group each R3 is hydrogen or a C1 C12 hydrocarbyl group, or the R3 substituents are joined to form a C4 C6 heteroring with the nitrogen atom provided that the total number of carbon atoms in theR1, R2 and R3 substituents is from 10 to 36. The invention also encompasses lubricant compositions, liquid hydrocarbon fuels, and additive compositions therefor, containing the above compounds. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The alpha phosphato amides of the present invention are useful as antiwear additives for lubricant compositions and liquid hydrocarbon fuels. Compounds herein containing sulfur at the alpha position are useful as extreme pressure additives for lubricants, while those containing oxygen at the alpha position are also useful as friction reducing additives for lubricants and fuels. The alpha phosphato amides herein are non corrosive when compared with corresponding acids and esters, and effective at relatively low concentrations when compared with other phosphorus based additives, such as the zinc dialkyl dithiophosphates. Thus, the compounds can provide lower levels of phosphorus in crankcase lubricants and fuels, and thereby reduce phosphorus poisoning of catalytic converters and other emission control equipment. While not intending to be limited by theory, it is believed that the highly polar nature of the present compounds causes them to more readily adsorb at metal surfaces than do compounds such as the zinc dialkyl dithiophosphates. It is believed that mechanical and thermal energy can break the bond between the phosphorus atom and the sulfur or oxygen atom at the alpha position in the present compounds, freeing some of the phosphorus and sulfur, when present, to chemically react with metal surfaces and form a stable antiwear film. Compounds herein containing sulfur at the alpha position also function as extreme pressure additives under heavily loaded conditions, while those containing oxygen at the alpha position also provide low coefficients of friction and function as friction reducing agents.The compounds are also thought to provide some detergency, corrosion inhibition, and metal deactivation benefits when added to lubricants and fuels. In the general formula for the compounds herein, each X can beS or 0. However, the alpha dithiophosphato amides i.e., compounds in which each X is S are preferred. The R1 substituent in the general formula can be any Cg C20 hydrocarbyl group. As used herein, hydrocarbyl is intended to include straight and branched chain alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, aryl, arylalkyl, alkylaryl and the like groups. It also includes substituted hydrocarbyl groups in which the substituent can be, for example, a chloro, fluoro, bromo, nitro, ethoxy, polyethoxy, propoxy, hydroxy, pentylthio or mercapto group. Highly preferred compounds herein are those in which R1 is a C8 C16 alkyl group. Each R2 substituent in the general formula for the present compounds can be hydrogen or a C1 C12 hydrocarbyl group, but preferably a C1 C8 hydrocarbyl group. Each R in the general formula for the present compounds can be hydrogen or a C1 C12 hydrocarbyl group. The R3 substituents can also be joined to form a C4 C6 heteroring with the nitrogen atom, such as an azetidine, pyrrolidine, piperidine or morpholine ring. Highly preferred compounds herein are those in which each R3 is hydrogen. These primary amides generally provide greatest antiwear, extreme pressure or friction reducing benefits. It will be appreciated that the above substituents should be selected such that the compounds herein exhibit sufficient solubility for their intended use. Thus, the total number of carbon atoms in the R1 and R2 and R3 substituents should be from 10 to 36, preferably from 12 to 24. A particularly preferred compound herein is alpha diisopropyl dithiophosphato lauramide i.e., in the general formula, each X isS, R1 is a C10 alkyl group, each R2 is an isopropyl group and each R3 is hydrogen . Examples of other preferred primary amides are alpha diisopropyl dithiophosphato stearamide, alpha dimethyl dithiophosphato Iauramide, the alpha dimethyl dithiophosphato amide of tallow fatty acid, the alpha diisopropyl dithiophosphato amide of coconut fatty acid and alpha di 2 ethylhexyl dithiophosphato lauramide.Other compounds useful herein are alpha phosphatolauramide, alpha monomethyl dithiophosphato stearamide, alpha S di 2 ethylhexyl thiophosphato caprylamide, alpha S dilauryl thiophosphato lauramide, alpha methyl ethyl dithiophosphato oleamide, N, N dimethyl alpha 0 diisopropyl thiophosphato lauramide, N monomethyl alpha O dimethyl thiophosphato stearamide, N,N dioctyl alpha dihydroxyethyl phosphato caprylamide, N talpha diisopropyl dithiophosphato lauroyl morpholine1 and N alpha dimethyl phosphato stearoyl piperidine. The compounds of the present invention can be effectively employed as antiwear, extreme pressure or friction reducing additives in a wide variety of lubricant compositions, including greases obtained therefrom.
