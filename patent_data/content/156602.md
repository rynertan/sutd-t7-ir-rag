# Image data transmission system.

## Abstract
In an image data transmission system carried by a craft, an image pickup apparatus 24 picks up optical images from an object zone to produce a succession of first image signals representative of the optical images and a succession of sec ond image signals having a predetermined delay time rela tive to the first image signals. The first image signals are previously processed by a reference signal generating circuit 44 to monitor frequencies of occurrences for a plurality of levels predetermined from a minimum level to a maximum one and to determine a reference signal necessary for dis tinguishing the second image signals. Amplitudes of the sec ond image signals are classified by a signal classifying unit 45 with reference to the reference signals into classified image signal successions which falls within at least two am plitude ranges. The classified image signal successions are individually encoded by at least two predictive encoding units 52 and 54 into encoded image signal successions, respec tively. The encoded image signal successions are combined by a combining unit 43 into a processed signal succession which is sent to a terrestrial station.
