## Description
This invention relates to the administration of drugs across human or animal body surfaces. As used herein, the term drug is defined as any biologically active chemical or natural substance useful for treating a medical or veterinary disorder, preventing a medical or veterinary disorder, or regulating the physiology of a human being or animal. More particularly, the invention relates to an administration method based on the use of biocompatible, water soluble, amphiphilic steroids capable of increasing the permeability of human and animal body surfaces to a variety of biologically active substances. Application of admixtures of steroid and drug to mucosal or epithelial surfaces advantageously results in enhanced drug delivery across the body surface. To elicit its characteristic biological response in the body, a drug must be available in an effective concentration at its site of action. The concentration of a drug that reaches its reactive site varies with such factors as the amount of drug administered, the extent and rate of its absorption, distribution, binding or localizaton in tissues, its biotransformation, and its excretion. For a review of these topics, see Goodman and Gilman s, The common routes of drug administration are enteral oral ingestion and parenteral intravenous, subcutaneous, and intramuscular routes of administration. To determine the appropriate mode of drug administration, it is necessary to understand some of the advantages and disadvantages of the route used. For example, intravenous drug administration is advantageous for emergency use when very rapid increases in blood levels are necessary. The intravenous route allows for dosage adjustments when required, and is also useful for administration of large volumes of a drug when diluted. However, there are limitations on the usefulness of intravenous drug administration. One problem is the risk of adverse effects resulting from the rapid accumulation of high concentrations of the drug in plasma and tissues. Consequently, intravenously administered drug solutions must generally be continuously monitored and injected slowly. The intravenous route is not suitable for oily or insoluble substances. Furthermore, intravenous administration is restricted to trained medical personnel. Other routes of parental administration are often inconvenient or painful for patients especially if frequent administration is required. Subcutaneous injection is used for drugs that are not irritating. This mode of administration is not suitable for delivering large volumes nor is it suitable for administering irritating substances which may cause pain or necrosis at the site of injection. Intramuscular administration is generally suitable for moderate volumes, oily substances, and some irritating substances. The intramuscular route cannot be used during anticoagulant medication and may interfere with the interpretation of certain diagnostic tests. Oral administration of drugs is generally more convenient and economical and is most acceptable to humans. However, this route of administration requires patient cooperation. Absorption may be inefficient Certain drugs which need to be administered frequently are not effectively absorbed when administered orally and hence must be delivered by injection methods. Yet, a number of problems are associated with conventional injection therapies. By way of illustration, conventional insulin therapy requires frequent insulin injections resulting in discomfort and disruption of the patient s lifestyle. Hence, many diabetics either refuse insulin therapy altogether or avoid intensive treatment regimens such as those which involve injections with each meal. In addition, certain patients, especially young children, elderly patients, and those who are blind and or disabled, often have difficulty with insulin self administration by injection. Furthermore, insulin absorption after subcutaneous injection is variable in terms of rate and amount depending upon factors such as exercise, local blood flow, depth and volume of injection, the presence of local proteases which degrade insulin, and perhaps other, unknown factors. Even presently available short acting and long acting preparations of insulin or mixtures thereof cannot mimic the daily glucose and insulin excursions of non diabetic individuals. Portable infusion pumps have now been employed to increase the ease of delivering subcutaneously meal related insulin boluses. However, these devices are externally worn and are therefore cumbersome. They require regular needle replacement, are complicated by local infections at the site of needle placement, are expensive, and are not acceptable to many patients. It is clear that a reproducible, reliable, and non invasive means for delivering drugs such as insulin would be highly desirable. What is needed especially in the case of insulin is a delivery system that would permit easy, rapid, and non invasive administration of insulin at meal times when blood glucose concentration rises to peak levels. Since the discovery of insulin six decades ago, there have been many attempts to develop alternate means of insulin delivery. For instance, insulin has been administered enterally, either alone or encapsulated in liposomes microcapsules , sublingually, vaginally, and rectally, with and without surfactants. In addition to the preceding routes of administration, the nasal route has been the subject of investigation for the delivery not only of insulin but of other drugs as well. It is known that certain very small peptides can be absorbed through the nasal mucosa as a snuff or directly from aqueous solution without an adjuvant. Examples of peptides which can sometimes be administered by this route are adrenocorticotrophic hormone ACTH , luteinizing hormone releasing hormone LHRH , oxytocin and vasopressin. Indeed, for patients with diabetes insipidus, the intranasal route is frequently the means for vasopressin delivery. In contrast to these directly administrable compounds, many drugs such as insulin are inefficiently absorbed across mucous membranes at physiological pH in the absence of adjuvants. Several workers have attempted to mix insulin with adjuvants that might enhance nasal insulin absorption. Hirai While the nasal mucosal route has received considerable attention for systemic drug delivery, it has also hitherto been known that drugs may be applied to mucous membranes of the conjunctiva, nasopharynx, oropharynx, ear canal, respiratory tract, vagina, rectum, colon, and urinary bladder for their local effects. We have discovered an effective means of administering a drug to a human being or animal which avoids many of the problems associated with other modes of administration such as injection. The invention provides the use of a composition for the manufacture of a medicament to be administered accross a human or animal body surface, said composition comprising in admixture a biocompatible water soluble amphiphilic steroid of the following formula wherein a dashed line represents a single or double bond This composition is useful for the prevention and or treatment of human or animal disorders and for the regulation of aspects of human or animal physiology, Other features of the present invention are described in the claims 3 71 and in the description below. The steroid of formula 1 can be unconjugated, i.e., D is O Na , O K , O Rb , O Cs , or some other ionic configuration, or it can be conjugated, i.e., D is an organic group containing at least one carbon atom. Preferably group D is one of the following groups Group D is preferably bonded to C₂₁ via an amide or ester linkage. Preferably the steroid used in the invention is characterized in that the unconjugated derivative of the steroid is retained on a hydrophobic column for a length of time sufficient to produce a k factor value of at least 4, the k factor value being obtained by subjecting a monomeric solution of 1 mg mℓ of such steroid derivative to high performance liquid column chromatography at 42670 kg cm² 3,000 psi , using a 250 x 4.6 column having octadecylsilane coated 5 µm silica particles as the stationary phase and a mobile phase, delivered at 1.0 mℓ min., consisting of 75 methanol in water, v v, buffered with 0.005 M KH₂PO₄ H₃PO₄ to give an apparent pH value, as measured using a glass electrode, of 5.0, the k factor value being defined by where t₀ is the retention time in the column of the solvent front and t Preferably the steroid is further characterized in that the critical micellar temperature CMT the temperature at which the steroid ceases to be an insoluble crystal or gel and begins to go into solution and self associate in solution of an aqueous 1 solution, w v, of the steroid is below human or animal body temperature, and optimally below about 0 C within the range of pH 2 to pH 12 a measure of solubility and the critical micellar concentration CMC the concentration at which the steroid ceases to be an ideal solution and begins to self associate is as high as 8 mMolar but preferably less than 4 mM and more preferably less than 2 mMolar at 37 C in 0.15 M NaCl as measured by surface tension. Preferred steroids are ionized or partially ionized alkali salts of fusidic acid, 24,25 dihydrofusidic acid, cephalosporin P₁ and C₂₁ conjugates of these and tauro 24,25 dihydrofusidate and glyco 24,25 dihydrofusidate. Other preferred steroids may be 17,20 24,25 tetrahydrofusidic acid, 3 acetoxyl fusidic acid, cephalosporin P₂ P₅, and C₂₁ conjugates of these and tauro 17,20 24,25 tetrahydrofusidate, tauro 16α OH 24,25 dihydrofusidate, tauro 16α OH 17,20 24,25 tetrahydrofusidate, tauro 16 O methyl ether 24,25 dihydrofusidate, tauro 16 O methyl ether 17,20 24,25 tetrahydrofusidate. The foregoing preferred steroids must be freely soluble in water at the pH of the composition to be administered. A broad spectrum of drugs may be used including but not limited to a peptides and polypeptides which have a molecular weight between about 100 and about 300,000 daltons, b non peptides, and c other drugs. The invention permits more effective, safer and convenient administration across a body surface of a human being or animal, The invention also allows drug administration to be tailored much more closely to cyclic disease states than is possible with other forms of administration. This is of particular importance with diseases such as diabetes in which drug requirements vary during the course of a day. It is contemplated that the adjuvants and methods of the instant invention can be used to administer agents useful for vaccination both active immunization with antigens and immunogenic fragments thereof as well as passive immunization with antibodies and neutralizing fragments thereof and to administer agents useful for birth control. It is further contemplated that the adjuvants and methods of the instant invention may potentially be useful for the delivery across plant surfaces of antiviral agents, systemic insecticides and herbicides and across arthropod surfaces of contact insecticides and miticides. Other features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments thereof, and from the claims. The steroid which is admixed with a drug to be administered is preferably an ionized or partially ionized, water soluble derivative of fusidic acid or cephalosporin P₁ P₅, preferably a derivative having formula 1 , above. These steroid molecules are all characterized in that they have the specific four ring structure of fusidic acid and cephalosporin P₁ P₅, including the boat conformation of the B ring in contrast to cholesterol derivatives such as bile salts, which have the B ring in the lower energy, more stable chair conformation . The structure of the steroid molecule affects its chemical properties and thus its functioning as a drug transporting molecule. We believe that all of the steroid molecules used in the invention facilitate transport by self associating to form reversed micelles within the membrane across which the drug is being transported these reversed micelles, it is believed, function as pores, allowing the drug to pass through. A measure of a given steroid molecule s ability to form such reversed micelles is the hydrophobicity of the unconjugated form of the molecule, a property which can be quantified using the k factor value, which is computed by observing the steroid s retention time in a high performance liquid chromatography HPLC column under the conditions described above. As mentioned above, the k value of the unconjugated derivative of the steroid should be at least about 4 for the steroid to be suitable in the therapeutic compositions of the invention. Critical micellar temperature CMT is an additional measure of a steroid s utility in the compositions of the invention. CMT is the temperature at which the steroid molecules abruptly become soluble and self associate into micelles from the gel or crystalline state. This change is a reflection of the colligative properties of the system, and the micelles formed at a temperature just above the CMT can be small, The steroids of formula 1 can be conjugated or unconjugated at C₂₁. The conjugating group can be any organic group which does not raise the critical micellar temperature of a 1 solution of the steroid above human or animal body temperature and preferably does not raise the CMT above about 0 C within the range of about pH 2 to about pH 12 and does not raise the CMC above about 8 mMolar at 37 C in 0.15 M NaCl as measured by surface tension. Preferably, the CMC is less than 2 mMolar under similar conditions. The conjugating group can be, Preferred conjugating amino acids are glycine and taurine. Preferred straight chain peptides are diglycine and glutathione, and preferred branched chain peptides are sarcosylcysteine, hydroxyprolinetaurine, and sarcosyltaurine. When the conjugating group is a polyether of at least sixteen carbon atoms, the group need not although it may contain an ionic function the ionic function is unnecessary because such groups are highly polar and thus confer solubility without ionization. For smaller polyether groups, an ionic function is generally necessary, although it can be weakly ionizable since the smaller polyethers are polar themselves. The group bonded to each of C₆ and C₁₆, independently, W and E in formula 1 can be OAc OCOCH₃ as in naturally occurring fusidic acid and cephalosporin P₁. Alternatively, E can be OH, an alkyl The molecule should possess two or three polar functions, exclusive of any side chains at C₂₁, at the positions indicated above where acetoxyl and hydroxyl groups can be located. The k and CMT of the steroids used in the compositions of the invention are influenced by whether the steroid is conjugated at C₂₁ and, if so, by the nature of the conjugating group. Additionally, a polar group at position 16 is essential for solubility See position E on formula 1 . Because the k factor value is influenced by the polarity of any conjugating group, unconjugated derivatives must be used in numerical comparisons involving steroids which are conjugated with different groups, or comparisons involving both conjugated and unconjugated steroids. Overall hydrophobicity and k factor value generally decrease as the polarity of the conjugating group increases. However, such decrease is not a reflection of the hydrophobicity of the steroid nucleus. It is this hydrophobicity which is the important parameter for purposes of reversed micelle formation. As discussed It is desirable that conjugated steroids have strongly ionized conjugating groups which are capable of forming micelles at low pH and concentrations the critical micellar concentration, CMC, is a measure of this latter property . As mentioned above, examples of such desirable conjugating groups include but are not limited to taurine, homotaurine, sarcosyltaurine, and sulfobetaine. Steroids conjugated with such groups also have the advantages of stability and ease of synthesis. Conjugation has additional effects as well, which provide the opportunity to tailor the conjugated steroid to a given clinical situation. For example, if the steroid is to be used to transport a drug across a mucosal membrane, Conjugation also, in some instances, lowers the CMC, so that only a small amount of steroid need be used. Strong acidic conjugating groups render the steroid resistant to being taken out of solution by variations in pH, ionic strength, and by the presence of other ions e.g. Ca and other macromolecules. Conjugation further prevents retention by the body, promotes rapid excretion, and prevents hepatic metabolism to potentially toxic metabolites Beauaboin As mentioned above, conjugating groups are bonded to C₂₁ via any suitable linkage, The properties of the steroid are also affected by the nature of the substituents at C₃, C₆ and C₁₆. Generally, OAc groups at these positions tend to aid solubility however, OAc groups are also quite labile, and tend to decrease stability and shelf life. The fusidic acid or cephalosporin P₁ P₅ derivatives can be made by appropriately modifying commercially available fusidic acid or cephalosporin P₁ P₅. Such techniques are known in the art. The drugs which are admixed with a steroid carrier preferably have a molecular weight of between about 100 daltons and about 300,000 daltons. The drug may be either water soluble or lipid soluble, and may be a peptide, Drugs for which the method of administration of the invention is particularly important are peptides. Suitable peptides include but are not limited to insulin, proinsulin, glucagon, parathyroid hormone and antagonists of it, calcitonin, vasopressin, renin, prolactin, growth hormone, thyroid stimulating hormone, corticotropin, follicle stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, chorionic gonadotropin, atrial peptides a natriuretic factor , interferon, tissue plasminogen activator, gammaglobulin, Factor VIII, and chemical modifications of these peptides. The invention can also be used to administer hormone releasing hormones, Other suitable drugs include the physiologically active enzymes transferases, hydrolases, isomerases, proteases, ligases, and oxidoreductases such as esterases, phosphatases, glycosidases and peptidases enzyme inhibitors such as leupeptin, chymostatin and pepstatin and growth factors such as tumor angiogenesis factor, epidermal growth factor, nerve growth factor and insulin like growth factors. Other suitable drugs are those normally absorbed to a limited extent across the gastrointestinal mucosa after oral administration Drugs such as anti infective agents, including antibacterial, antiviral and antifungal agents may also be administered according to the method of the present invention. For example, antibiotics such as the aminoglycosides Many other drugs may also be administered according to the invention, Other suitable drugs are the water insoluble, fat soluble hydrophobic drugs, The surface across which transport occurs may be any mucosal surface such as the nasopharynx, conjunctiva, oropharynx, ear canal, rectal, intestinal enteral , respiratory tract, endometrial, cervical vaginal, urethra, urinary bladder or, in some circumstances, a skin surface such as the axilla, the gluteal cleft, tympanic membrane, between the toes, and the groin. Additionally, transport of the drug according to the method of the present invention may enhance penetration into the skin for increased local effects. The ratio of drug and steroid present in a therapeutic composition will vary depending on a number of factors, including the k and CMC of the steroid, the dosage of the drug to be administered, and the chemical characteristics, The concentration of the drug in the solution will of course vary widely, depending on the nature of the drug, and on the extent to which absorption is facilitated by the steroid. In some cases, administration according to the invention will enable the delivery of a higher dosage of the drug where needed than if the conventional mode of administration is used in other cases, a much smaller dosage can be used because of efficient administration to a site. For instance, the amount of drug potentially can be decreased to one thousandth the amount or increased to ten times the amount of the drug normally used with conventional administration methods. The therapeutic composition may contain, in addition to steroid and drug, any other desired non toxic, pharmaceutically acceptable substances, The dosage given at any one time will depend on a number of factors including, in addition to those mentioned above, the frequency of administration. The compositions of the present invention may be administered to human and animal body surfaces in a variety of forms, including but not limited to, sprays, drops, suppositories, douches, salves, ointments, and creams. Some compositions may be advantageously applied in long term release dosage forms such as slow release, continuous release and intermittent release dosage forms. These long term release dosage forms include but are not limited to polymers, microcapsules, microspheres, osmotic diffusion devices and membrane release devices. The following examples are intended to illustrate the invention, without acting as a limitation upon its scope. Examples 1 14 demonstrate the effectiveness of using various fusidic acid derivatives Leo Pharmaceuticals, Ballerup, Denmark and cephalosporin as adjuvants for the delivery of insulin, glucagon, human chorionic gonadotropin hCG , proinsulin, corticotropin releasing factor CRF and epinephrine across nasal mucosal membranes or conjunctival membranes in humans or sheep. Assays of insulin, glucagon, and hCG across nasal mucosal membranes and conjunctival membranes were accomplished by highly specific radioimmunoassay RIA . Protocols for RIA of insulin followed the procedures given in GammaCoat ¹²⁵I Insulin Radioimmunoassay Kit, Cat. No. CA 532, Clinical Assays Division of Travenol Laboratories, Inc., Cambridge, MA and for glucagon, the procedures given in Protocol for the Radioimmunoassay of Glucagon ¹²⁵I , Cat. No. 520, Cambridge Medical Diagnostics, Middle Billerica, MA In the case of proinsulin, an insulin immunoassay with significant cross reactivity for proinsulin was adapted to estimate the amounts of proinsulin absorbed. The protocol is given in Insulin ¹²⁵I Radioimmunoassay, Corning Medical and Scientific, Medfield, MA. The values obtained for insulin were adjusted to correlate with known cross reactivity The final concentration of insulin varied for each subject since they were of different weights.

Two sheep were administered 350 mg ketamine a general anesthetic intravenously and 1.0 Unit kg body weight of insulin to the conjunctival sac as drops at time 0. As shown in Table VII below, five minutes after conjunctival administration, the serum insulin level of both sheep had increased greater than five fold. Unlike human subjects, sheep do not respond to these increments in serum insulin levels with a decrease in blood glucose concentrations. Sodium tauro 24,25 dihydrofusidate was dissolved in 0.15 M NaCl, 0.5 M sodium phosphate, pH 7.6. The dry powder of bovine glucagon Eli Lilly Co., Indianapolis, Ind. was dissolved in the fusidate buffer to a final concentration of 1 mg mℓ, pH 7.6. A sheep was administered 350 mg ketamine intravenously and 200 µℓ of the glucagon solution was administered as a liquid at time 0, by drops into each side of the nose of the sheep. The dose of glucagon was approximately 10 µg kg body weight. Serum glucagon levels were determined as shown in Table VIII. Five minutes after intranasal administration, the glucagon level had increased more than one hundred twenty fold demonstrating that the glucagon had been rapidly and effectively absorbed through the nasal mucosa. Glucagon was also administered to the nasal mucosa without adjuvant. However, no direct control studies were performed since glucagon is relatively insoluble at neutral pH. Instead, studies were performed as with the adjuvant, at pH 2.7. 420 µg glucagon was dissolved in 0.002 N HCl to administer the same concentration of material as described above. 200 µg of glucagon was administered to each side of the nose at time 0. Glucagon was absorbed across the nasal mucosa without adjuvant at pH 2.7. However, the percentage of increment was not as great without adjuvant as with adjuvant. Sodium tauro 24,25 dihydrofusidate was dissolved in 0.15 M NaCl, 0.05 M sodium phosphate, pH 7.6. Bovine glucagon was dissolved in the fusidate containing buffer to a final concentration of 1 mg mℓ, pH 7.6.

As described in Table IX below, in the presence of the adjuvant, glucagon was absorbed across the conjunctival mucosa. Since glucagon is relatively insoluble at neutral pH, no direct control studies were performed. However, in the absence of the adjuvant, glucagon was dissolved in 0.002 N HCl, pH 2.7, as described in Example 8 above. The studies indicated that glucagon was not absorbed across the conjunctival mucosa to a significant extent. Sodium tauro 24,25 dihydrofusidate was dissolved in 0.15 M NaCl, 0.05 M sodium phosphate, pH 7.6. Human chorionic gonadotropin hCG, a glycoprotein of MW 39,000 National Pituitary Agency, Baltimore, MD was dissolved at a concentration of 2 mg mℓ in 0.15 M NaCl and 0.5 M sodium phosphate. The hCG was mixed with the fusidate containing buffer to a final concentration of 1 , pH 7.6. 350 mg of ketamine was administered intravenously and one mg of hCG was administered at time 0 in the form of drops 250 µℓ in each nostril of a sheep. As shown in Table X below, the data indicate that in the presence of adjuvant, significant blood levels of hCG did not appear in either animal until 20 to 30 minutes after administration. Sodium tauro 24,25 dihydrofusidate was dissolved in 0.15 M NaCl, pH 7.6. Commercially available proinsulin Eli Lilly Co., Indianapolis, Ind. was mixed with the sodium tauro 24,25 dihydrofusidate solution or in 0.15 M NaCl, pH 7.6 to give a final concentration of 6 mg mℓ of proinsulin and 1 w v sodium tauro 24,25 dihydrofusidate. Sheep were administered by nasal drops 1.5 mg 250 µℓ of the solution into each nostril at time 0. Sheep 25 was administered proinsulin without adjuvant as described above. As shown in Table XI below, proinsulin was rapidly absorbed in the presence of adjuvant. However, in the absence of adjuvant the proinsulin was absorbed at a slower rate and to a much reduced extent. Sodium tauro 24,25 dihydrofusidate was mixed with proinsulin as described in Example 11. Sheep were administered a total of approximately 2.1 mg of the proinsulin solution to the conjunctiva at time 0. As indicated in Table XII below, proinsulin was rapidly absorbed across the conjunctival membranes in the presence of sodium tauro 24,25 dihydrofusidate. Sodium tauro 24,25 dihydrofusidate was dissolved in 0.15 M NaCl, pH 7.6 to form a 2 solution, w v. Corticotropin releasing factor CRF, a hormone of MW 4,000 Dr. George Chrousos, National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD was dissolved in 0.15 NaCl and mixed with the 2 solution of sodium tauro 24,25 dihydrofusidate. CRF was also prepared without adjuvant. Two sheep were administered 350 mg ketamine intravenously and a total of 460 µg of CRF as a liquid, by drops into each side of the nose of the sheep at time 0. The dose of CRF was approximately 10 µg kg body weight. As shown in Table XIII, serum CRF levels were determined either with or without adjuvant. Five minutes after intranasal administration with adjuvant, the CRF level had increased more than 200 fold. In contrast, without adjuvant the CRF level increased only slightly. The data indicate that CRF had been rapidly and effectively absorbed across the nasal mucosa. Sodium tauro 24,25 dihydrofusidate was dissolved in 0.05 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.6 to form a 3 solution. Commercially available epinephrine in solution 1 1000 Elkins Sinn, Richmond, VA was mixed with 0.1 mℓ of the 3 solution of sodium tauro 24,25 dihydrofusidate. A sheep was administered 350 mg ketamine intravenously and 150 µℓ of the epinephrine solution as drops to each nostril at time 0. The sheep was also administered epinephrine as described above without adjuvant at a later time. Epinephrine levels were measured following extraction of plasma and running on HPLC with electrochemical detection. As shown in Table XIV below, in the presence of adjuvant, epinephrine was absorbed across the nasal mucosa to a greater extent than without adjuvant.
