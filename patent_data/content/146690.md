# Flame sensing system.

## Abstract
A flame rod 22 inserted in a flame created by the secondary air supplied to a burner 11 is used to generate a flame signal voltage. This flame signal voltage fluctuates with the amount of secondary air available and with the fuel supplied. These fluctuations are relied upon by an integrated control system 45 that utilizes a microprocessor or micro computer to safely control an induced draft type of furnace.
