# Voltage control type semiconductor switching device.

## Abstract
A voltage control type semiconductor switching device Q1 is disclosed which includes a pair of control electrodes 20, 22 to which a control voltage signal is supplied, and a semiconductive layer 10 formed between the electrodes 20, 22 so as electrically insulative from the electrodes 20, 22 through insulative layers 16, 18 . The semiconductive layer 10 has a channel region 10a and a carrier storage region 10b which is substantially nonconductive. The channel region 10a is formed laterally along the longitudin al direction y of the electrodes 20, 22 , thereby allowing majority carriers such as electrons of the semiconductive layer 10 to flow in the lateral direction y . In the current cut off mode, the carrier storage region 10b temporarily stores the carriers which move in the direction x of thickness of the semiconductive layer 10 due to the electric field created by the voltage. In the current conduction mode, the carrier storage region 10b releases the carriers stored therein toward the channel region 10a .
