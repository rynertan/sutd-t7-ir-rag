# Toy inertia motor.

## Abstract
A toy inertia motor for driving a rotatable power or drive shaft 14 . The drive shaft is coupled, for example, to any suit able members or mechanisms such as the drive wheels on a toy car 32 , or a windlass. The motor comprises a rotatable flywheel 16 , and sepa rate winding and driving gear trains for coupling the flywheel to the drive shaft. A gear of the winding and driving gear trains is movable D D , C C in response to rotation of the drive shaft, between a normal drive position in the driving gear train is to a wind position in the winding gear train. A latch 44 is re sponsive to such gear movement for releasably latching the gear in its wind position. When so latched, the flywheel inertia can be built up by rotating the flywheel. When the latch is re leased 64, 62, 58 , the gear returns to its drive position and the flywheel inertia is transmitted via the driving gears to the drive shaft.
