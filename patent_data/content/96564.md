# FORMS MANUFACTURING SYSTEM

## Abstract
Process and apparatus for manufacturing multi part forms F1, F2, F3 uses web presses having printing stations and processing stations at which operations are performed on webs in registry with a series of printed images, and uses a collator to assemble related webs from said presses, and to perform additional operations on assembled webs in registry with images thereon. A digital job description of a form is created, including location of printed images on several parts of the form and location of process items, e.g. perforations, holes, or cuts on parts of the form. This job description is stored in the memory of a computer PR 2 with a job identifying code. Also, a digital description is created of images to be printed on the form, and stored in memory with the job identifying number. Image descriptions are recalled from memory and used to create printing plates for the presses and to pre set printing and processing sections of a press for each part of the form. The form parts are then produced on the presses and supplied to the collator. The job description is recalled from memory and used to pre set stations of the collator to assemble and complete processing of the multi part forms. The computer also gathers and stores management data as the presses and collator operate, keeps a record of supplies tools needed for each job and makes this information available to operators through terminals, and maintains records of jobs entered, work in process, and jobs shipped.
