## Description
The present invention relates to new stabilizer products for lubricant oils and greases having perfluoropolyether structure. The so stabilized lubricants are resistant to degradation and do not corrode the metals, such as, e.g., Al, Ti, V, or their alloys, or steels at temperatures comprised within the range of from 50 C to 300 C, und oxidizing atmosphere and when the metal or alloy and the lubricant, either as oil or as grease, are in contact with each other. More particularly, the invention relates to stabilizers on the basis of arylphosphines or of derivatives of arylphosphines, possibly having an oxygen or sulphur atom directly bonded to the phosphorus atom, containing at least one perfluoroether chain in their molecule. Further object of the invention is to provide a process which can be easily implemented on industrial scale and allowing the above said stabilizers to be produced with considerable reductions in production costs. It is known that the use of fluids having polyperfluoropolyether structure at high temperature under an oxidizing atmosphere causes with time, generally within a time period of about twenty hours, a progressive degradation of the fluid, when this is in contact with metals or alloys. The degradation depends both on the conditions under which the fluid is used, and on its chemical structure. For example, perfluoropolyether fluids marketed under the trade name Fomblin Z From the prior art perfluoroarylphosphines, disclosed in USP 3,393,151 and USP 3,499,041, and used as corrosion and degradation inhibitors in perfluoropolyether fluids, are known. They are characterized by having three perfluorinated benzene rings bonded to the phosphorus atom or to the phosphinoxido group USP 3,393,151 , or the perfluorinated benzene rings can be differently substituted with always completely fluorinated groups of the type of C Although such products perform their action as inhibitors of metal corrosion and of perfluoropolyether degradation, as hereinabove mentioned, they are however poorly soluble in perfluoropolyethers at low temperatures, and moreover some of these compounds result volatile at high temperature. Furthermore, in USP 3,567,803 are described stabilizers of the class of phosphinates having the following structural formulae R Moreover, the amount of phosphinate to be added to perfluoropolyether, according to the said patent, must be quite high, of the order of 5 10 by weight. Amounts of stabilizer as high as these, besides impairing the fluodynamic characteristics of the perfluoropolyether fluid, render still more critical the low temperature solubility of these additives in perfluoropolyethers, and this causes considerable storage problems, due to the precipitation of the stabilizer. Furthermore, these stabilizers, even when they are stored separately, must be kept under conditions as anhydrous as possible, because they are very sensible to the hydrolysis. All these drawbacks limit the application thereof as stabilizers of perfluoropolyethers. Arylphosphines, not necessarily completely fluorinated, are also known from USP 4,011,267, to be used as stabilizers for the above mentioned applications, having formulae of The group R These stabilizers are prepared by starting from dibromotetrafluorobenzene, which is reacted with a Grignard compound e.g., ethylmagnesium bromide a treatment is then carried out with a cuprous halide. The organocuprous compounds so obtained is reacted with a perfluoroacyl halide The so functionalized bromobenzene is treated with butyllithium and subsequently with PCl₃ or dichlorophenylphosphine or chlorodiphenylphosphine, to yield the products according to the patent. Such a preparation method is not much interesting from a practical viewpoint, in that it requires very complex reactions, which cannot be proposed for a fullscale application. By this method, products are obtained in very small amounts at of very high cost. Arylphosphines, disclosed in USP 4,454,349, are moreover known, of general formula Such products are obtained by reacting a dibromobenzene with butyllithium, the compound obtained is then reacted with a perfluoropolyether, having an esther as the end group, to obtain the ketone the carbonyl group is then fluorinated by SF₄ and HF. The so obtained product is treated with butyllithium and then with PCl₃ to obtain the triarylphosphinic compounds. Such arylphosphines have the same stabilizing properties as of those disclosed in prior USP 4,011,267, but they are obtained by a more simplified process, and starting from cheaper precursors, that considerably reduces the production costs, even if these remain however very high. Also this process results not suitable to a fullscale passage, in that it contains, as critical and essential step, the reaction of fluorination of C O group by SF₄ and HF. Such a fluorination by SF₄ and HF involves problems both as for the equipment required, and as for the control of the fluorination reaction, due to the following reasons New products have been now surprisingly found, with stabilizing characteristics comparable to those of the products disclosed in USP 4,011,267 and USP 4,454,349, but which can be obtained by a synthesis which eliminates the critical step of fluorination by SF₄ and HF, reaction considered as essential to obtain products with high stability characteristics for the applications as described. The synthesis of these new products can be easily carried out on industrial scale, gives high yields in stabilizers and results much less burdensome from the financial viewpoint, allowing low cost stabilizer products for perfluoropolyether oils and greases, for use in the presence of metals or alloys at high temperatures and under oxidizing atmosphere, to be offered on the market. The object of the present invention are hence new products having the structure of arylphosphines or derivatives thereof, with an oxygen or sulphur atom direclty bonded to the phosphorus atom, containing at least one perfluoroether chain as a substituent on the benzene rings, and suitable to be used as stabilizers of perfluoropolyether oils and greases, so as to prevent the degradation thereof and the corrosion of metals, such as, e.g., Al, Ti, V or their alloys, or steels when the lubricants are used in an oxidizer environment, at high temperature, in the presence of the above said metals or alloys. The new products being the object of the invention are selected from the following classes of compounds having the general formulae The products according to the present invention can be obtained according to the process as hereinunder disclosed for the various B groups. The products of the invention are used as stabilizers for lubricating oils or greases having polyperfluoropolyether structure and are added to them in amounts comprised between 0.05 and 3.0 by weight, preferably between 0.5 and 1 . The greases are obtained by adding a suitable thickener to the perfluoropolyether. This method for the preparation of greases is known in the art it is disclosed, e.g., in published European Patent application EP 95,825. The perfluoropolyethers used as lubricating oils or greases are selected from the hereinunder indicated clases of compounds comprising the constituting units of the following types The perfluoropolyethers which can be used with the products of the invention are selected in particular among those belonging to the following classes of perfluoropolyethers The result of the invention is much more surprising, in that it was totally unexpected that the replacement of CF₂ bridge, obtained from the fluorination of C O group, with a non perfluorinated group would allow arylphosphines to be obtained with stability characteristics as high as those of the phosphines of the prior art under similar use conditions. As a consequence, the products of the invention can be used, similarly to those of the prior art, as stabilizers of lubricating fluids or greases with perfluoropolyether structure in the presence of metals at high temperatures and under an oxidizing atmosphere. Moreover, the products of the invention are soluble in the lubricant at the concentrations as indicated, without modifying the physical characteristics thereof, such as the lubricating power and the viscosity. To the purpose of illustrating the invention, the following Examples are given, which are intended however as being not limitative of the same invention.

To a solution of potassium tert.butoxide 12.4 g 0.11 mol in tert.butanol 150 ml heated at 40 C, 64.8 g 0.1 mol of After stirring for 1 hour at 40 C, 24.7 g 0.1 mol of bromopentafluorobenzene is added, and the mixture is refluxed for 2 hours. Tert.butyl alcohol is distilled off, the reaction mixture is diluted with H₂O and with 1,1,2 trichloro 1,2,2 trifluoroethane solvent, and the organic phase is separated. After extraction of the aqueous phase with the same solvent, and combining of the organic phases, the solvent is evaporated off. By vacuum distillation of the reaction product, the brominated product of formula Such bromoderivative is converted into the corresponding phosphine by the process as disclosed in Example 1. The following product is obtained 45 g of a mixture of alcohols of general formula After a 2 hours stirring at 40 C, 12.9 g of 1 trifluoromethyl 3 chloromethyl 4 bromobenzene is added dropwise. The reaction mass is refluxed for 4 hours. KCl is filtered off, the solution of tert.butyl alcohol is separated as light phase, the product is washed with water after the addition of 1.1.2 trichloro 1,2,2 trifluoroethane to facilitate the separation of the phases. The desired product is obtained with practically quantitative yields as the residual liquid after having evaporated off the solvent. The results of I.R. and N.M.R. ¹H and ¹⁹F analyses are in accordance with the formula From the bromoderivate the corresponding phosphine is obtained by using the technique as described in Example 1. 370 g triphenylphosphinoxide is portionwise added to a nitric acid sulphuric acid mixture composed by 8.3 mol of HNO₃ and 18.4 mol of 98 sulphunic acid, with the temperature being maintained at 10 15 C. The mixture is further stirred for 1 2 hour after the addition of the last portion, and the whole is poured into 7.5 litres of water and ice. The precipitate is filtered off, washed with water and ice cool ethanol. The product is dried in ovent at 110 C, and is then dissolved in acetic acid and precipitated by an excess of ethanol it has melting point 241 242 C, as measured by differential thermal analysis. The I.R., N.M.R. and elemental analysis confirm the product to be substituted with nitro groups on the three phenyl rings in meta position, i.e., to be tris m nitrophenyl phosphinoxide. 200 g of tris m nitrophenyl phosphinoxide is portionwise added to a solution, kept under stirring at 90 95 C and constituted by 200 ml of water, 1200 ml of 36 hydrochloric acid and 1050 g of SnCl₂. After a further hour of stirring at 90 95 C, at the end of the last addition of the nitroderivative, the reaction mixture is cooled and poured into an alkaline solution containing 3.9 mol of NaOH. The precipitate is filtered off, washed with water and dissolved again in diluted sulphuric acid. The solution is decolorized by activated charcoal and is precipitated again with aqueous NaOH. The precipitate, washed with water, is crystallized from methanol its melting point is 256 C. The titration with perchloric acid in acetic acid confirms the value of molecular weight to be 323, pertaining to tris m aminophenyl phosphinoxide. A portion of 60 g of tris m aminophenyl phosphinoxide is added to 36.7 g of methylpolysiloxane and to 350 ml of diphenylether and is refluxed for 6 hours. After cooling, 48 g crystallize yield about 80 of product having a melting point of about 200 C, which the analysis confirms to be tris m aminophenyl phosphine. 32.3 g of a mixture of phenyl esters of general formula A liquid product is discharged, which on I.R. analysis does not show any longer the absorption peak due to the ester CO 5.55 µ , but shows the amidic peak 5.7 5.8 µ and hence corresponds to the formula 64.6 g of a mixture of phenyl esters, as of Example 4, of formula After two hours, the reaction vessel is connected to the vacuum of a mechanical pump to distill off all the phenol evolving from the reaction. A liquid product remains as the residue, which on I.R. analysis does not show any longer the absorption peak relating to the CO group of ester type, and has the formula A series of tests is carried out to verify the thermooxidative stability in the presence of metals of lubricating compositions containing the stabilizers of the invention. The equipment for such tests is constituted by a glass test tube equipped with a gas inlet pipe, with vent outlet and with means to house two metal discs, respectively of steel AISI 304 18 Cr, 10 Ni and of Ti, V 4 , Al 6 alloy. Into the test tube, 50 g of perfluoropolyether fluid, covering the two metal discs, is introduced. The test tube is heated to the desired temperature inside an aluminium oven.
