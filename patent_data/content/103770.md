# Homogeneous low melting point copper based alloys.

## Abstract
A copper based low melting point metal alloy composi tion consists essentially of about 2.5 to 11 atom percent tin, about 0 to 12 atom percent nickel and about 11 to 15 atom percent boron, the balance being essentially copper and incidental impurities. The composition is such that the total of copper and tin ranges from about 85 to 89 atom percent.
