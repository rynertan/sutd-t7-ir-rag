## Description
This invention relates to a method of producing a defoamer composition. The foaming of a liquid presents a serious problem in a variety of industrial processes including the treatment of the liquid itself or the treatment of something else by the liquid. The foaming of the liquid brings about a reduction in the efficiency of the treatment or a lowering in the quality of the product to be manufactured. It is known that the problem of foaming may be solved by a defoamer having the effect of breaking foam in a liquid or inhibiting or reducing its foamability. A silicone defoamer is particularly suitable, since it is chemically stable and hardly has an influence on the liquid to which it is applied, and its use in a very small quantity produces a relatively large defoaming effect. Various types of silicone defoamers have hitherto been proposed and are known. For example, Japanese Patent Publication No. 23613 1970 describes a defoamer composition composed of dimethylpolysiloxane oil, a specific siloxane resin and silica aerogel. Japanese Patent Publication No. 1602 1972 describes a defoamer composition obtained by heating polyorganosiloxane with a finely powdered additive, such as silica, in the presence of an alkaline substance. The known silicone defoamers have, however, the disadvantage that their defoaming effect, particularly their foam inhibiting effect, lasts only for a short period of time and fails to satisfy the requirement of a process in which it is necessary to inhibit foam for a long period of time. US A 3 560 401 describes an antifoam composition having effectiveness especially in aqueous alkaline medium, and a method for preparation of the composition. The composition is prepared by the heat treatment at 100 300 C for 0.5 5 hours of a mixture of an organosiloxane polymer liquid, a finely divided inorganic filler and alkaline basic material. It is an object of this invention to provide an improved method of producing a defoamer composition which maintains an excellent foam inhibiting effect for a long period of time. This invention is characterized by reacting at a temperature of 50 C to 300 C The invention will now be described more specifically. According to this invention, a mixture of the components 1 to 6 is reacted under heat to produce a defoamer composition. Component 1 is a polyorganosiloxane expressed by the general formula R 1 aSiO Component 2 is a polyorganosiloxane expressed by the general formula R 2 b R³O Component 3 is any of the following compounds a to d Component 4 is a finely divided filler such as fume TiO₂, Al₂O₃, Al₂O₃ SiO₂ and SiO₂. Silica SiO₂ can be produced by a dry method such as the thermal decomposition of a silicon halide or the reaction of a substance containing silicic acid under heat, or silica produced by a wet method such as the decomposition of a metal salt of silicic acid, e.g., sodium silicate, by an acid or the aerogel method. Various grades of silica having a particle size of several millimicrons to several microns and a specific surface area of about 50 to 500m² g are commercially available. Fume TiO₂, Al₂O₃ and Al₂O₃ SiO₂ can be prepared by the well known process of burning TiCl₄, AlCl₃ and SiCl₄ and mixtures thereof. Component 5 is a compound used as a catalyst for promoting the reaction of the other components. It is preferably selected from siloxane equilibration and or silanol condensing catalysts such as alkali metal hydroxides, alkali metal silanolates, alkali metal alkoxides, quaternary ammonium hydroxides and silanolates, quaternary phosphonium hydroxides and silanolates and metal salts of organic acids. These compounds are well known in the field of silicone chemistry and are not considered to need any detailed description. KOH and CsOH are examples of alkali metal hydroxides. If one of them is reacted with low molecular silicone or silicate or a partially hydrolyzed product thereof, there is obtained an alkali metal silanolate. If the low molecular silicone or silicate which is employed corresponds to any of the compounds from which the component 3 is selected, the resulting alkali metal silanolate is also suitable for use as component 3 and if its amount covers the quantity required of component 3 , it is not always necessary to use any additional component 3 . The alkali metal alkoxide is a product of the reaction between an alkali metal hydroxide and an alcohol having one to five carbon atoms. Examples of quaternary ammonium hydroxides are beta hydroxyethyltrimethyl ammonium hydroxide, benzyltrimethyl ammonium hydroxide and tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide. Examples of quaternary phosphonium hydroxides are tetrabutyl phosphonium hydroxide and tetraethylphosphonium hydroxide. Examples of the metal salts of organic acids are dibutyltin dilaurate, stannous acetate or octanoate, lead naphthenate, zinc octanoate, iron 2 ethylhexoate and cobalt naphthenate. Component 6 is a polyorganosiloxane expressed by the general formula R 8 e R⁹O A mixture of components 1 to 6 , is reacted under heat to produce a silicone defoamer composition. The proportions of the components are the proportion of each of components 3 to 6 being shown for a total of 100 parts by weight of 1 and 2 . The proportions of components 1 and 2 depend largely on their viscosity. Component 2 having a high viscosity, e.g., close to that of gum, can be used if it is combined with component 1 of low viscosity. It is preferable to use a mixture of 1 and 2 which has a viscosity of 1,000 to 100,000 mm² s cs at 25 C. An appropriate mixture of the components each in an appropriate quantity may be prepared by mixing all the components except 4 and then admixing 4 uniformly by an appropriate dispersing device, such as a homomixer, colloid mill or triple roll mill. The mixture is heated to a temperature of 100 C to 300 C and reacted for one to eight hours, although the reaction time varies depending on the temperature. The details of the reaction of the various components is not clear. However, it is apparent that a reaction takes place because no defoaming effect is expected from a simple mixture of the components which is not heated. It is preferable to carry out the mixing and heating of the components in an inert gas atmosphere in order to avoid any danger and remove volatile matter unreacted matter, by products, etc. . The mixing order of the components and the heating temperature and time as hereinabove stated are not critical, but can be changed as required. The silicone defoamer composition produced by this invention may be used as it is, or in the form of a solution obtained by dispersion in an appropriate solvent or an emulsion obtained by a known emulsifying method, and provides a defoamer having a good defoaming effect which lasts for a long period of time. The invention will now be described with reference to examples which are merely illustrative of this invention.
