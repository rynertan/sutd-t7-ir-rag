# Batch annealing apparatus.

## Abstract
A batch annealing apparatus comprises a bell shaped furnace 1, a base plate 41, an inner cover 2, plus a bottom chamber 11 that opens upward, has an inside diameter slightly larger than the outside diameter of a metal coil to be treated therein is capable of accommodating the metal coil C, and disposed below the furnace. A cylindrical stationary base 31 coaxially extends upward from the bottom of the bottom chamber 11. The stationary base 31 has a partition 33 with an outside diameter slightly smaller than the inside diameter of the metal coil C that is formed at a point corresponding to the opening of the bottom chamber 11. The base plate 41 is annular in shape, equipped with cooling means 42, 45 and supported by elevatable supporting means 67 that passes through the bottom 14 of the bottom chamber 11. The lower end of the supporting means is connected to an elevating device 71 .
