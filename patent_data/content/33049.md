# Novel linear hydroquinone phenoxy polymers, process for making them and use as blends with polyesters to obtain laminated films.

## Abstract
This invention relates to novel thermoplastic polymers and to a process for their preparation. Specifically it relates to novel substantially linear, high molecular weight phenoxy resin prepared from hydroquinone, optionally up to 20 mole percent of a second aromatic diol, epichlorohydrin or another epihalohydrin and a base, such as sodium hydroxide in the presence of a solvent for the polymer. Hydroquinone phenoxy resin is characterized by low permeability to oxygen and carbon dioxide and is, therefore, useful as a gas barrier layer in multilayer plastic film construc tions used in food packaging and beverage bottle application, for example. For use in such applications, the resin is gener ally in the form of a thin, uniform film prepared by extrusion, casting, or other such method. It is highly desirable that polymers used in this manner be as free as possible from chain branches or crosslinks, as these lead to the formation of gel particles which cause imperfections in the polymer film. These imperfections, in turn, detract from the appearance of the film. Moreover, as is well known, increasing the amount of chain branching in a polymer results in an undesirable reduc tion of flexibility and toughness.
