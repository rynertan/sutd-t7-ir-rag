## Description
The present invention generally relates to video signal recording and reproducing apparatuses, and more particularly to a video signal recording and reproducing apparatus which records at the time of a recording a sampled signal which is obtained by sampling an input composite video signal at a frequency slightly higher than an upper limit frequency of a frequency band required by the input composite video signal, and obtains a reproduced video signal at the time of a reproduction by alternately and time sequentially multiplexing for every one sampling point two kinds of reproduced sampled signals having a mutual time difference of one field. Generally, a helical scan type video tape recorder hereinafter simply referred to as a VTR records at the time of a recording a video signal on a traveling magnetic tape by use of one or a plurality of rotary heads, and reproduces at the time of a reproduction the recorded video signal from the magnetic tape by use of the one or plurality of rotary heads. The above video signal has a wide frequency band having an upper limit frequency of 4.2 MHz, for example. For example, in order to frequency modulate the video signal having the wide frequency band and record and reproduce the frequency modulated video signal on and from the magnetic tape, it is necessary to set a relative speed between the head and the magnetic tape to a high speed over a predetermined value and use a high performance head which is highly sensitive in the high frequency range, as is well known. However, in the case of a VTR for home use, the relative speed between the head and the magnetic tape is inevitably set to a speed which is considerably smaller than the predetermined value due to the necessity to reduce the size and weight and manufacture the VTR for home use at a low cost. For this reason, the recording and reproducing frequency band of the VTR for home use became narrower than the original frequency band of the video signal, and this interfered with the reproduction of a picture having a high picture quality. Accordingly, one of the inventors of the present application has previously proposed a video signal recording and reproducing apparatus in a British Patent Application GB A 2 143 401 No.8415008 entitled VIDEO SIGNAL RECORDING AND REPRODUCING APPARATUS filed June 13, 1984 DE A 3 4422 016 filed June 14, 1984 and FR A 2548501 filed June 15, 1984. According to this previously proposed video signal recording and reproducing apparatus, a recording video signal is sampled at a frequency f However, according to the previously proposed apparatus, the sampling frequency f Further, at the time of the recording, the previously proposed apparatus also performs the sampling with respect to the synchronizing signals of the input composite video signal. Hence, when a jitter is introduced between timing of the edge of the synchronizing signals and the timing of the sampling pulse having the sampling frequency f GB A 2040640 discloses an arrangement for digitising an NTSC colour television signal in which an input video signal is sampled with a frequency whose phase differs by 180 for each field. The sampled signal is recorded and reproduced such that the reproduced signal comprises first and second reproduced sampled signals having a mutual time difference of one field. A signal having the same frequency as the sampling rate and a phase which differs by 180 for every field is generated from the reproduced signal and used as a switching signal for alternately passing the reproduced sampled signals for every half period of the switching signal. A reproduced composite video signal is thus obtained which has been re sampled at twice the frequency. According to the invention, there is provided a video signal recording and reproducing apparatus as defined in the appended Claim 1. Preferred embodiments of the invention are defined in the other appended claims. It is thus possible to provide a video signal recording and reproducing apparatus in which a sampling frequency f It is also possible to improve the horizontal resolution to approximately 300 lines or more by use of a recording and reproducing apparatus having a narrow frequency band for example, a horizontal resolution of 240 lines . In addition, it is possible to prevent the sampled signal which is to be recorded from having jitter due to the jitter in the relative phase between the sampling pulse and the synchronizing signals, because the sampling and re sampling are not performed with respect to a signal interval at least including the synchronizing signal intervals. Moreover, since the re sampling process is performed only with respect to the signal interval excluding at least the synchronizing signal intervals, it is possible to reduce the memory capacity required in a memory which is used for the re sampling. On the other hand, because the re sampling process is performed with respect to the high frequency component over the frequency f The present invention will be further described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which In the embodiment shown in Figure 1, an input composite video signal such as the luminance signal is applied to an input terminal 11 and is supplied to a first signal generating circuit 12 and a sampling circuit 13. The first signal generating circuit 12 generates a signal having a sampling frequency f The sampling circuit 13 samples the input composite video signal by the output signal of the first signal generating circuit 12, but does not perform the sampling with respect to the synchronizing signal intervals and passes the synchronizing signals as they are. A sampled signal obtained from the sampling circuit 13 is recorded on a recording medium not shown by recording means 14. The recorded signal is reproduced from the recording medium by reproducing means 15. The recording means 14 and the reproducing means 15 have conventionally known constructions. The signal reproduced signal reproduced from the recording medium by the reproducing means 15 is supplied to a reproduced sampled signal generating circuit 16 and a second signal generating circuit 17. The reproduced sampled signal generating circuit 16 simultaneously generates from the reproduced signal first and second reproduced sampled signals having a relative time difference of one field. The second signal generating circuit 17 generates a signal having a frequency identical to the frequency f The sampling circuit 13 does not perform the sampling at least with respect to the synchronizing signals. For this reason, even when a jitter exists in the relative phase between the synchronizing signals and the output signal sampling pulse of the first signal generating circuit 12, it is possible to perform the recording so that the synchronizing signals do not include the jitter caused by the sampling. In addition, it is possible to improve the vertical resolution and prevent the occurrence of the crawling phenomenon. In other words, in the case where the frequency f In the previously proposed video signal recording and reproducing apparatus described before, the positions of the sampling points of the video signal which is obtained by performing the sampling and re sampling with the sampling frequency f In addition, when it is assumed that the sampling points of the first reproduced sampled signal supplied to the re sampling circuit 18 in three adjacent scanning lines are located at positions indicated by white circular marks in FIG.3B, for example, the sampling points of the second reproduced sampled signal which is delayed by one field with respect to the first reproduced sampled signal are located at positions indicated by black circular marks in FIG.3B. However, because the re sampling circuit 18 alternately and selectively generates the first and second reproduced sampled signals for every time period of 1 2f In FIG.3B, numbers indicated in the left represent the delay in terms of horizontal scanning line numbers with reference to the scanning line represented by a number 0 . The video signal recording and reproducing apparatus shown in FIG.1 uses the sampling points of one field before. For this reason, there is a problem in that an after image occurs when recording and reproducing a video signal having no field correlation such as a video signal related to a moving picture. Accordingly, another embodiment in which this problem is eliminated, is shown in FIG.2. FIG.2 is a system block diagram showing the other embodiment of the video signal recording and reproducing apparatus according to the present invention. In FIG.2, those parts which are the same as those corresponding parts in FIG.1 are designated by the same reference numerals, and description thereof will be omitted. The signal obtained from the re sampling circuit 18 is filtered of the high frequency component thereof over the frequency f According to the second embodiment of the video signal recording and reproducing apparatus shown in FIG.2, the area over which the after image occurs is made extremely small by the provision of the first and second filter circuits 20 and 21 and the mixing circuit 22. As a result, the after image is virtually inconspicuous in the picture. In the low frequency range of the video signal under the frequency f Furthermore, since the re sampling process at the time of the reproduction is only performed with respect to the high frequency component over the frequency f More detailed description will now be given with respect to concrete embodiments of the video signal recording and reproducing apparatus according to the present invention. FIG.4 is a system block diagram showing a concrete construction of the embodiment shown in FIG.1. In FIG.4, those parts which are the same as those corresponding parts in FIG.1 are designated by the same reference numerals. First, a description will be given with respect to the operation at the time of the recording. At the time of the recording, the input composite video signal for example, a luminance signal is applied to the input terminal 11 and is supplied to a synchronizing signal separating circuit 32 through a switching circuit 31 which is connected to a terminal Accordingly, the switching circuits 35 generates a sampling pulse which has the frequency f Therefore, the switching circuit 38 is alternately turned ON and OFF for every video period of the input composite video signal and for every one half period 1 2f As may be understood from the equation 1 , the sampling frequency f The recording means 14 and the reproducing means 15 are constituted by the recording and reproducing apparatus 40. The recording and reproducing apparatus 40 is an existing VTR having a narrow frequency band and a horizontal resolution in the range of 240 lines, for example. The sampled signal is passed through a known recording system within the recording and reproducing apparatus 40 and is recorded on a magnetic tape not shown and is reproduced from the magnetic tape. Next, a description will be given with respect to the operation at the time of the reproduction. At the time of the reproduction, the reproduced sampled signal is obtained through a reproduced video signal output terminal 43 and is supplied to the synchronizing signal separating circuit 32 through the switching circuit 31 which is connected to a terminal P. On the other hand, the reproduced sampled signal is supplied to a field memory 45 through an analog to digital A D converter 44. The horizontal synchronizing signal within the reproduced sampled signal is supplied to the PLL circuit 33 and the timing generator 34, and the sampling pulse having the frequency f The field memory 45 comprises a random access memory RAM and reads out an input digital signal thereof digital signal of the first reproduced sampled signal after delaying the input digital signal by one field. An output digital signal digital signal of the second reproduced sampled signal of the field memory 45 is supplied to a terminal 46b of a switching circuit 46. As will be described later, the re sampling is not performed during the blanking period, and the re sampling is only performed during the video period. Hence, the field memory 45 only needs to write in and read out the digital data related to the video period. As a result, the memory capacity of the field memory 45 only needs to have a small memory capacity in the order of 80 the memory capacity which will be required when delaying the video signal by one field with respect to all intervals of the video signal including the video period and other periods, and an inexpensive RAM can be used for the field memory 45. The switching circuit 46 is applied with the output sampling pulse of the switching circuit 37 having the sampling frequency f On the other hand, the output pulse of the timing generator 34 is applied to the switching circuit 48, so as to turn the switching circuit 48 OFF during the blanking periods and turn the switching circuit 48 ON during the video periods. The output pulse of the timing generator 34 is also passed through an inverter 49 and is applied to a switching circuit 50, so as to turn ON the switching circuit 50 during the blanking periods and turn OFF the switching circuit 50 during the video periods. Accordingly, during the blanking period, the synchronizing signals and the like which are not re sampled and obtained from the switching circuit 50 are passed through a delay circuit 51 which is provided to compensate for the time delay of the reproduced sampled signal in the field memory 45 and are supplied to the output terminal 19. During the video period, the re sampled signal obtained from the switching circuit 48 is supplied to the output terminal 19. Next, a description will be given with respect to the concrete construction of the embodiment shown in FIG.2, by referring to FIG.5. In FIG.5, those parts which are the same as those corresponding parts in FIGS.2 and 4 are designated by the same reference numerals, and description thereof will be omitted. The recording system of the embodiment shown in FIG.5 is the same as the recording system of the embodiment shown in FIG.4, however, the reproducing system shown in FIG.5 is different from the reproducing system shown in FIG.4. The re sampled signal obtained from a D A converter 47a is supplied to a highpass filter comprising a capacitor 61 and a resistor 62. The high frequency component of the re sampled signal over the frequency f On the other hand, the reproduced signal obtained through the reproduced video signal output terminal 43 of the recording and reproducing apparatus 40 is supplied to a terminal 66a of a switching circuit 66. The reproduced signal is also supplied to a lowpass filter comprising a resistor 64 and a capacitor 65. The low frequency component of the reproduced signal under the frequency f According to the present embodiment, the re sampling is only performed with respect to the high frequency component, and an A D converter 44a and the D A converter 47a do not require a large number of bits. It has been confirmed that the number of bits required in the present embodiment can be reduced by approximately one half to five bits, for example, compared to the number of bits eight bits required in the A D converter 44 and the D A converter 47 of the first embodiment wherein the re sampling is performed with respect to the entire frequency band. In addition, the memory capacity of a field memory 45a of the present embodiment can be approximately 5 8 the memory capacity required in the field memory 45 of the first embodiment wherein the re sampling is performed with respect to the entire frequency band. In the case where an existing helical scan type VTR is used for the recording and reproducing apparatus 40, signal terminals are provided as shown in FIG.6. In FIG.6, those parts which are the same as those corresponding parts in FIG.5 are designated by the same reference numerals. In the existing VTR shown in FIG.6, the input composite video signal applied to a recording video signal input terminal 71 is supplied to a luminance signal and carrier chrominance signal separating circuit hereinafter simply referred to as a Y C separating circuit 72 wherein the luminance signal and the carrier chrominance signal are separated from the input composite video signal. The separated luminance signal is supplied to the circuit shown in FIG.5 through the input terminal 11. On the other hand, the luminance signal which is applied to the input terminal 41 is passed through a pre emphasis and clipping circuit 73, a clamping circuit 74, a frequency modulator 75, and a highpass filter 76. An output signal of the highpass filter 76 is supplied to an adding circuit 77. The separated carrier chrominance signal from the Y C separating circuit 72 is converted into a signal format suited for magnetic recording and reproduction, in a color signal processing circuit 78. The adding circuit 77 adds the output signal of the highpass filter 76 and the output signal of the color signal processing circuit 78. For example, the output signal of the color signal processing circuit 78 is a carrier chrominance signal which is frequency converted into a low frequency band, and the adding circuit 77 frequency division multiplexes the output signal of the highpass filter 76 with the output frequency converted carrier chrominance signal of the color signal processing circuit 78. An output multiplexed signal of the adding circuit 77 is passed through a recording amplifier 79 and is supplied to rotary heads 81 through a switch 80 which is connected to a terminal The recorded multiplexed signal is reproduced from the magnetic tape 82 by the rotary heads 81 which are rotated under control based on the output signal of the drum motor control circuit 83. The reproduced signal is passes through the switch 80 which is connected to the terminal The Y C mixer 91 mixes the reproduced carrier chrominance signal and the reproduced luminance signal which is obtained through the output terminal shown in FIG.5, and generates a reproduced composite color video signal. The reproduced composite color video signal is passed through an amplifier 92 and is supplied to an output terminal 93. The present invention is not limited to the embodiments described heretofore, and as a modification, the circuit part provided externally with respect to the recording and reproducing apparatus 40 can be unitarily assembled within the VTR, for example.
