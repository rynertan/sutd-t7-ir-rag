# Process for the preparation of calcium sulphate anhydrite.

## Abstract
Calcium sulphate dihydrate is recrystallized into anhyd rite with the aid of H₂SO₄ at elevated temperature in several steps. In the first step concentrated H₂SO₄ is applied, while in each further step as H₂SO₄ containing medium is used the acid liquid from the preceding step resulting after removal of anhydrite, with the temperature and residence time in each step being higher, respectively longer, than in the preceding step. By this process large amount of dihydrate can be converted with a small amount of H₂SO₄, thereby reducing or even avoiding the captive production of diluted H₂SO₄.

## Description
PROCESS FOR TES PREPARATION OF CALCIUM SULPHATE ANHYI RITE, AND CALCIUM SULPHATE ANHYDRITE OBTAINED BY THIS PROCESS The invention relates to a process for the preparation of calcium sulphate anhydrite in which calcium sulphate dihydrate is recrystallized at elevated temperature in a liquid containing sulphuric acid, the calcium sulphate anhydrite formed is separated from the acid recrystallization liquid, and washed with water. A process of this kind is known form the U.S. Patent Specification No. 2,531,977. In the process described there calcium sulphate dihydrate obtained in a phosphoric acid preparation process is treated with sulphuric acid having a H2S04 concentration of 15 33 by weight, at a temperature of between 60 OC and the boiling point of the sulphuric acid solution and in a residence time of more than 30 minutes, more in particular 2 3 hours. The calcium sulphate anhydrite formed is separated out and washed with water, and the remaining acid recrystallization liquid is returned to the phosphoric acid preparation. A disadvantage of this known process is that for the conversion of calcium sulphate dihydrate rather a substantial amount of sulphuric acid is needed, with uptake of crystal water, washing water and impurities metals resulting in the production of a large quantity of dilute and contaminated sulphuric acid solution, which can hardly be put to any use outside the preparation of phosphoric acid. Concentrating such a sulphuric acid is fraught with difficulties because of the presence of the impurities, and, also, repeated use of such a sulphuric acid in a phosphoric acid preparation process necessitates a cleaning operation in order to prevent accumulation of contaminants in the process. The invention provides a process enabling large quantities of calcium sulphate dihydrate to be converted into anhydrite with the help of a small quantity of sulphuric acid, in which process it is even possible to avold captive production of dilute sulphuric acid altogether, whilst it is also possible in a simple way to remove the metal components from the dihydrate, and, if so desired, to recover them. According to the invention this is achieved in that in a first step a quantity of calcium sulphate dihydrate is converted with concentrated sulphuric acid, after which quantities of freshly supplied calcium sulphate dihydrate are converted in a number of further steps, with the temperature and residence time in each step being higher, respectively longer, than in the preceding step, using as sulphuricacid containing liquid in each separate step the recrystallization liquid from the preceding step, after removal therefrom of calcium sulphate anhydrite.By preference, the wash liquid obtained in the washing of the anhydrite is also supplied to the following recrystallization step. It is also possible, however, to subject the quantities of wash liquid obtained in the separate steps, optionally collectively, to a treatment for the removal of sulphate, phosphate and metal components, and to drain the resulting aqueous phase, or to supply at least part of it to the process. It has been found possible thus to convert over 10 kg e.g.12 20 kg calcium sulphate dihydrate into anhydrite with the help of I kg of concentrated sulphuric acid In the present process the recrystallization liquid used in the first step is a concentrated sulphuric acid with an H2S04 content of, preferably, 55 70 Z by weight, related to the quantity of liquid phase in the recrystallization mixture. This recrystallization liquid can be obtained by feeding in a highly concentrated say, 96 98 X wt. sulphuric acid, and returning to the first step part of the acid recrystallization liquid obtained in this first step after anhydrite removal. In general a temperature of 30 50 OC and an average residence time of 5 20 minutes are then applied in this first step. Subsequently, in each of a number of steps a new amount of dihydrate is converted into anhydrite with the help of the acid recrystallization liquid obtained in the preceding step, this recrystallization liquid becoming progressively more dilute from each step to the next, on account of it taking up crystal water and, possitbly, wash water. The number of steps employed may vary, for instance from 3 to 10. In particular, the quantity of dihydrate to be converted and the number of steps are taken such that in the final step a recrystallization liquid with an X2S04 concentration lower than 15 x wt. results, with a temperature of 90 120 OC and a residence time of 1.5 3 hours being applied in this final step. It is further possible according to the invention largely to remove from the dilute acid liquid resulting from this final step after renoval of anhydrite the sulphate, the phosphate and the metallic contaminants. To this end this liquid is advantageously treated with a calcium compound, the precipitate containing calcium sulphate, calcium phosphate and metals is separated out, and at least part of this precipitate is returned to the recrystallization. By preference the precipi tate thus obtained is concentrated and the concentrated product is returned to the final recrystallization step. Various calcium compounds may be used for this treatment, for instance calcium oxide, or salts such as calcium carbonate, calcium sulphide, calcium nitrate or calcium chloride.Especially suitable are calcium oxide and calcium carbonate, because if these are used the anions are not left behind in the recrystallization liquid. In order to prevent accumulation of contaminants in the process this calcium addition is preferably effected in two steps, with the amount of calcium compound supplied to the first step being smaller than the amount equivalent to the quantity of sulphate in the acid liquid, in particular such an amount that the pH cf the liquid is brought to a value of about 1.5 3. The precipitate then formed contains, in addition to calcium sulphate and calcium phosphate, the greater part of the metals contained in the dihydrate.This precipitate is separated out, e.g. by filtratIon, and can, if so desired, be subjected to a further treatment of a known kind, for recovery of the metal components. Subsequently, such an amount of calcium compound is added to the liquid remaining after the first precipitation step that virtually all of the sulphate present is precipitated, with formation of a calcium sulphate dihydrate that is virtually free of phosphate and metals, which dihydrate is returned to the recrystallization. The aqueous phase remaining after the removal of the precipitate can be drained or be returned, at least in part, to the process as washing liquid for the several anhydrite washing treatments. The calcium sulphate anhydrite resulting in the various steps is separated out, in particular by filtration, after which the filter cake is washed with water. The product consists virtually quantitatively of calcium sulphate anhydrite, and is suitable for instance for use in the production of building elements, as a setting retarder for cement, coating in the paper industry, iller in the paper, paint and plastics industries, and as a starting material for the preparation of technicalgrade calcium compounds. The calcium sulphate dihydrate used may be natural gypsum or a dihydrate obtained as a byproduct of chemical processes, in particular the decomposition of rock phosphate with mineral acids, such as nitric acid.
