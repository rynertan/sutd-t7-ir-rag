# Information recording medium.

## Abstract
In an information recording medium having a recording layer 1 for recording information by heating through incoming energy, at least one of an interference layer 2 and an absorption layer for the incoming energy is provided on the energy incoming side of the recording layer to reduce the reflected energy from the information recording medium and increase the quantity of heat input into the recording layer. The temperature of the recording layer is rapidly enhanced, and rapid writing is made possible thereby. Writing or erasing can be made with less incoming energy, and thus the writing sensitivity or erasing sensitivity of the information recording medium can be increased.
