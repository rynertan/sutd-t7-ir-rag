# Improved synthesis of molybdenum alcohol complexes useful as epoxidation catalysts.

## Abstract
Storage stable solutions of molybdenum alkanol com plexes in the alkanol are prepared by reacting a molybdenum oxide and ammonium hydroxide and an amount of a straight chain or branched chain C₆ C₁₃ alkanol, within the range of about 10 to about 55 moles of alkanol per gram atom of molybdenum sufficient to form a storage stable molybde num alkanol complex. The complex forming reaction is initiated in the presence of about 1 to about 4 moles of water per gram atom of molybdenum and about 0.5 to about 10 moles of ammonia per gram atom of molybdenum, the water and ammonia preferably being added in the form of concentrated ammonium hydroxide. The reaction is con ducted at a temperature of about 120 to about 190 C for a period of time, normally about 3 to about 8 hours, sufficient to substantially completely remove ammonia and water to provide a liquid reaction product comprising said solution of molybdenum alkanol complex dissolved in unreacted alka nol and containing about 0.001 to about 0.1 wt. of water. The reaction product is filtered to provide a clarified storage stable solution of the molybdenum alkanol complex having a dissolved molybdenum content of about 3 to about 10.5 wt. .
