# Hosiery toe closing method and apparatus.

## Abstract
Toe closing socks H first involves stretching them flat on a carrier 21, 22, 24 . One of the resulting confronting layers 11 of fabric is then effectively held substantially immobile by engaging a fabric holding device 40 to 42 with the fabric. While this layer 11 is immobilised, the other layer 12 is displaced longitudinally by a movable displacing means 45 to 48 which is brought into engagement there with. While maintaining the layers 11, 12 mutually dis placed, for example by clamping them to one another, they are conveyed past a sewing machine 28 and seamed. By seaming the layers 11, 12 together while they are mutually displaced, the seam S will adopt an overfoot or underfoot position in the finished sock due to readjustment of the fabric and the return of the layers 11, 12 to their normal relaxed relative dispositions.
