# Substrate composition and use thereof.

## Abstract
A substrate composition for reaction with an enzyme, comprising carrier particles and a substrate adsorbed thereto and being characterized in that the carrier consists of polyvinylchloride. Polyvinylchloride of emulsion type is particularly preferred. A preferred substrate is tricaproin which is enzymatically split by lipase enzyme. The use of the substrate composition as a substrate component in enzymatic time temperature indicating devices is also disclosed.
