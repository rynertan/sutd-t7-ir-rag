# Alumina based ceramics for core materials.

## Abstract
Alumina based ceramics for core materials having a good leachability and being non reactive with the alloy up to 1800 C. The ceramic material, before firing, consists of at least an alumina based compound material having the general formula MO NAl₂O₃, wherein M is Na₂, Ca, Sr or Ba, N is from 9 to 11 when M is Na₂ and N is 6 when M is Ca, Sr or Ba, and is, after firing, being characterized by a density of from 40 percent to 75 percent of theoretical and an interconnected network defining a plurality of interstices in which undoped alumina grains are found. Application for making cores for casting directionally solidified eutectic and superalloy materials.
