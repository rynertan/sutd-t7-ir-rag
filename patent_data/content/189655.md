## Description
This invention relates to sequential decorrelator arrangements such as are used in adaptive antenna arrays to perform beamforming operations. Adaptive beamforming provides a powerful means of enhancing the performance of a broad range of communication, navigation and radar systems in hostile electromagnetic environments. In essence, adaptive arrays are antenna systems which can automatically adjust their directional response to null interference or jamming and thus enhance the reception of wanted signals. In many applications, antenna platform dynamics, sophisticated jamming threats and agile waveform structures produce a requirement for adaptive systems having rapid convergence, high cancellation performance and operational flexibility. In recent years, there has been considerable interest in the application of direct solution or open loop techniques to adaptive antenna processing in order to accommodate these increasing demands. In the context of adaptive antenna processing these algorithms have the advantage of requiring only limited input data to accurately describe the external environment and provide an antenna pattern capable of suppressing a wide dynamic range of jamming signals. The objective of an optimal adaptive antenna system is to minimise the total noise residue including jamming and receiver noise at the array output whilst maintaining a fixed gain in the direction of the desired signal and hence lead to a maximisation of resultant signal to noise ratio. One way of implementing an adaptive beamforming algorithm is by the use of the so called sequential decorrelator . British patent No. 1,599,035 describes a sequential decorrelator using open loop decorrelation stages. Figs. 1 and 2 of the present specification illustrate a 5 element network as disclosed in this Patent and a simplified representation of the open loop decorrelation cell respectively. Only in the steady state, in the limit of an infinite time average, will this network provide an effective weight transformation to the input data identical to the optimal least squares solution as defined by McWhirter, J.G., Recursive Least Squares Minimization using a Systolic Array , Proc. SPIE, Vol. 431, Real Time Signal Processing VI, 1983, discussed later. The convergence characteristics of the Sequential Decorrelator as described in patent 1,599,035 differ significantly from the optimal least squares solution if the network is operated on the fly with data samples continuously applied to the processor. Optimal convergence can only be obtained by re cycling input data through to network and by updating the decorrelation weights on a rank by rank basis. This mode of operation obviously detracts from real time application. With the standard sequential decorrelator, each decorrelation cell adaptively combines the applied signals as shown by Fig. 2. The decorrelation weight is derived from the ratio of unnormalized, sampled data estimates of the cross and autocorrelation of the input signals. Hence, we have where and and where denotes a complex conjugate. Since the V² k factor is used by all decorrelation stages within a particular rank, then autocorrelation estimates in fact can be calculated by a separate processing stage as shown by Fig. 3. The arrangement of Fig. 3 utilises two types of processing cell referred to as boundary cell and internal cell respectively. Figs. 4a 4d show schematic diagrams of the different processing stages for the standard sequential decorrelator. Fig. 4b is a detailed expansion of the simple schematic stage shown in Fig. 4a and Fig. 4d is a detailed expansion of the simple schematic shown in Fig. 4c. For a fuller understanding of the standard Sequential Decorrelator and in particular the boundary and internal processing cell functions the reader is directed to IEE proceedings, Vol.131, Pt. F, No. 6, October 1984, pages 638 645, Application of a systolic array to adaptive beamforming Ward et al., especially Fig. 5 and 6 thereof. This paper discloses the basic form of triangular array of cascaded stages, each stage including a boundary cell and a group of internal cells, the group in each stage having one less internal cell than the group of the preceding stage and the first stage group having one less internal cell than the number of antenna elements. Note that in Fig. 4d of the present application the box labelled half complex multiply multiplies a complex number U k by a real number D. The basis of this invention is to show how the standard sequence decorrelator architecture Figs. 3, 4 b and 4 d can be simply modified to provide an identical adaption characteristic as the optimal least squares architecture which implements the QR decomposition algorithm. According to the present invention there is provided a sequential decorrelator arrangement for an adaptive antenna array, the array comprising a plurality of antenna elements the outputs of which feed a cascaded beamforming network having a succession of stages, each stage including a boundary cell and a group of internal cells, the internal cells in each stage comprising means for combining input data in accordance with a weighting factor D common to all the internal cells in a stage, the boundary cell associated with each stage comprising means for computing the weighting factor D to be applied to the internal cells of the stage from the output of one internal cell of the preceding stage and propagating an λ factor through successive boundary cells, the output of the last internal cell of the last stage being multiplied by the λ factor output of the last boundary cell, the group in each stage having one less internal cell than the group of the preceding stage and the first stage group having one less internal cell than the number of antenna elements, each internal cell of the first stage having as one input the output of a respective antenna element and as a second input an output of the associated boundary cell and each cell of each subsequent stage having as one input the output of a respective internal cell of the preceding stage and each internal cell having as a second input an output from the associated boundary cell of the same stage, characterised in that each stage includes means for scaling the output of each internal cell in the stage by a scaling factor β derived at each boundary cell from the ratio of the square root of the autocorrelation value of the input signal signal of said boundary cell at the last and current updates and and in that each boundary cell provides at its output the signal present on its input, the weighting factor D being a function of the autocorrelation value of said input signal and the λ factor itself being scaled by the reciprocal of the factor β in each boundary cell. For a clearer understanding of the invention, the term weighting as used herein denotes the application of a factor or numerical quantity which, when applied to a decorrelation cell, affects the processing of the applied signals in the cell. Likewise the term scaling as used herein denotes the application of a factor or numerical quantity which when applied to the output from a decorrelation cell, simply alters the value of the output. Although both a weighting factor and a scaling factor may be derived from the same boundary cell the two factors can be derived according to different mathematical processes and can therefore have different values. Embodiments of the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Referring to Fig. 5, the vector of residuals from the array is given by The optimal adaptive control law is defined as the weight solution which minimizes the norm of the residual vector, is representative of the best estimate of the output power from the array after k data snapshots, the weight set which minimizes the norm of The optimal solution can be derived by the least squares, QR decomposition processing algorithm. This technique performs a triangularization of the data matrix, A decorrelation cell can be constructed with the QR decomposition algorithm and is shown by Fig. 6. It consists of two essential processing nodes i the boundary stage, which computes the rotation coefficients , and ii the internal processor, which performs the rotational transform. The terms V k and U k are effectively stored within the two processing stages and are resultant from the previous rotation following the application of the k Using the previous notation we define and When the samples, x k 1 and y k 1 are applied to the cell, a new transformation is computed whereby Now, the coefficients c and s denoting the rotation transform are and This therefore gives for the resultant factors A and B and The important term of the transformed matrix described by equation 4 is α K 1 since this will be an integral part of the required output from the decorrelation cell. Therefore, computing α K 1 gives and substituting for coefficients C and S gives Now This can be reduced to Choosing λ K 1 c V k V k 1 and forming the product α k 1 .λ k 1 then gives It is therefore noted that the product α K 1 . λ K 1 is equivalent to a beamformed output It should be noted that this result corresponds exactly to that for the conventional decorrelation cell where the weight coefficient is computed from the quotient of recursively updated cross and auto covariance estimates. Previous work by McWhirter has shown how a number of these decorrelation stages based on the QR decomposition algorithm can be cascaded to form an arbitrary N element decorrelation network. A 4 input channel example capable of processing signals from 4 separate antenna elements is shown by Fig. 7 with corresponding cell descriptions given by Figs. 8a, 8b. Since the stored components in the networks shown by Figs. 3 and 7 are essentially identical, it is possible to deduce how the standard Sequential Decorrelator can be modified to provide an identical adaptation characteristic as the QR decomposition architecture. The modified sequential decorrelator is shown by Fig. 9, from which we note that By factorising equation 12 we have that Therefore, the scaling factor, β, is which can be readily evaluated with minimal modification to the boundary cell of the sequential decorrelator architecture. A schematic diagram detailing the internal operation of the boundary stage of the modified network is shown by Fig. 10. In this modified cell, further processing is required to handle the λ factor which is propagated along the boundary edge of the array. We thus have at the i
