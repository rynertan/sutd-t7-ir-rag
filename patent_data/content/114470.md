# Two stage hydraulic valves.

## Abstract
A fail safe solenoid operated two stage hydraulic spool valve has a pilot spool with four raised lands and is constructed in two parts 12, 13 urged away from each other by a spring 14 . The pressure ports 16, 17 lie outside the pilot service ports 4, 5 , and the tank gallery 15 is located between them. In normal operation, the solenoids 20, 21 hold the two spool portions 12, 13 together against the force of the spring 14 . Should the electric supply to the solenoids fail, the spool portions 12, 13 are separated by the spring 14 thereby venting the service ports 4, 5 to tank, and thereby venting the service ports 4, 5 to tank, and thereby allowing the centring springs 31, 32 of the main stage to return the main spool 25 to its central position in which the load is hydraulically locked against movement.
