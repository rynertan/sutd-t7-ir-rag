# METHODS OF MAKING MAGNETIC RECORDING MEDIA 111111

## Abstract
A method of making a magnetic recording medium in cludes sputtering a magnetic material containing iron onto a substrate 3 in an atmosphere of argon gas mixed with nitro gen gas to deposit a magnetic film on the substrate 3 . The ni trogen is preferably present in an amount of 10 to 10000 ppm, and a preferred version of the method comprises jointly sput tering a rare earth metal and an iron cobalt alloy.
