# Method of waterproofing surfaces such as tunnels, canals and mines.

## Abstract
A method for waterproofing surfaces, especially the inte rior surfaces of tunnels, canals and mines, including the steps of a cutting strips of lining material b drilling holes in the in terior surface, according to the various transversal sections of the surface to be waterproofed c fastening the strips of lining material to the surface by fastening members, so that the strips of lining material are anchored to the surface d coupling each strip with the adjacent strips, in both longitudinal and transver sal directions, to make a leaktight weld between them e cover ing the fastening members not covered in the coupling opera tion with accessory pieces of lining material f placing a cord or stringer of waterproof material at the side edges of the lining sections, between the end strips and the lower part of said side edges and g sealing with an elastic sealer holes in the inner lin ing which enable the fastening members projecting from the surface to pass through the lining strips, as well as those joints between sheets or strips which, in addition to the welding be tween said sheets, require watertightness.
