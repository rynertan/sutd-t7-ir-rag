# Liquid developers for electrostatic images and method of producing them.

## Abstract
A liquid developer for developing electrostatic images comprises a dispersion in aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent of particles of imaging material, binder and polymeric carba mate having a linear carbon backbone and carbamate side chains in which the carbamate groups contain at least one alkyl group having at least 5 carbon atoms carried by the nitrogen atom thereof, the binder and the polymeric carba mate are soluble in the hydrocarbon solvent when hot and insoluble in the hydrocarbon solvent at room temperature so as to be present in co precipitated form in the developer.
