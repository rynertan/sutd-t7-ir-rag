# Zinc bromine battery with long term stability.

## Abstract
A zinc bromine secondary battery having a recirculating electrolyte uses an array of cells 14, 15, 16 in series with a parallel fluid flow through the several cell spaces along the confronting electrodes. The intermediate electrodes 16 are bipolar with their cathode face 26C having a coherent porous mass of binder free charcoal particles of stable dimensions and configuration lightly pressed into electrical contact with it and with each other. Spacer means 26C holds the particles off from contact with the confronting anode face. A single electrolyte flows through each cell with a flow path divided so that a high speed and throughput major portion bypasses the charcoal particles and a minor portion branches therethrough. The zinc bromine molarity of the electrolyte is preferably 0.5 1.5 at full charge and 2 to 4 at deep discharge and preferably only about 1 by weight of the molecular bromine present is in circulation with the remainder trapped in the electrode assemblies at all times. The cell has a minimum long term system degradation, has limited self discharge and has low environmental hazards.
