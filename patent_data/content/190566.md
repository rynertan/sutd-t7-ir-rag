# ELECTROCHEMICAL GAS SENSOR

## Abstract
An electrochemical gas sensor 10 is described for detecting a gas constituent, for example hydrazine in a gas ambient 34 incorporating an electrochemical cell including a reference electrode 11, counter electrode 12 and sensing electrode 13 spaced apart and with an electrolyte 14 in contact with each electrode and comprising n methyl 2 pyrrolidone and a salt soluble therein, for example tetraalkyl ammonium salt. The invention overcomes the problem of specificity, service life and operating temperature range associated with aqueous electrochemical gas sensors.
