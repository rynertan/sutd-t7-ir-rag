The cycloalkyl, aryl, and fused aryl cycloalkyl structures can also contain one or more, preferably up to three, hetero atoms, i.e., sulfur, oxygen, or nitrogen atoms, thereby forming a hetero ring. At least one, and preferably one, of M1, M2 andM3 is aryl or has an aryl moiety, in which the aryl group or moiety carries two or three substituents other than hydrogen.Such an Mi group is preferably connected to the main chain by non labile bonds, so that the molecule 1 resists cleavage in the stomach and is thus intact when it enters the blood, which enhances the therapeutic effect and duration of the compound and may reduce undesirable side effects. Structures having an aryl moiety include aryl containing one or more hetero atoms, polycyclic aryl, polycyclic aryl containing one or more hetero atoms, fused arylcycloalkyl, and fused arylcycloalkyl containing one or more hetero atoms. Preferred structures include those in the above list of cyclic and polycyclic structures which have an aryl ring of six carbon atoms.Preferred substituents for the aryl ring include halogen, nitro, lower alkyl, COOH, carboxy lower alkoxy, phenoxy, and hydroxy sulfamoyl which is optionally substituted with alkyl and amino which is optionally substituted with lower alkyl, phenyl, phenyl lower alkyl, heteroaryl lower alkyl, nitro lower alkyl, lower alkyl carbonyl, and lower alkyl carbonyl aminoalkyl, e.g., CH3C O NH CH2 24NH , CH3C O NH , and furfurylamino .

Of particular value are those compounds which include sulfamyl substituted phenyl groups and benzothiadiazine l, l dioxides and the 3,4 dihydro derivatives thereof, especially as parts of the Z 1M1 or Z2tI2 groups of formula I. In notation such asEMI6.2 in which K is written twice we intend to ladicae that each K can be any of the substituents listed bereinabove for R. The halo groups include fluoro, chloro, bromo and iodo. Preferred hetero atoms are S, 0, and N. Preferred acyl groups are lower alkyl carbonyl, and aryl carbonyl. Preferred compounds are those in which at least one, and more preferably both of R1 and R2 are hydrogen or lower alkyl. Compounds in accordance with the present invention are readily prepared employing known starting materials and procedures. It will be understood by those skilled in the art that the carbon atoms to which R1 andEMI7.1 are attached can be asymmetric centers, such that the inventive compounds may exist in R,R , R,S , S,R , and S,S formsThe carbon atom to which R2 is attached can also be an asymmetric center. Individual isomers and diastereo isomeric mixtures of said forms are within the scope of the invention.The preferred forms have S,S or S,S,S configuration. The products of the present invention can be prepared by amide forming reaction of an acid of formula 1A or amide forming derivative thereofEMI7.2 with a compound of formula 1 B EMI8.1 Alternatively, the present compounds can be formed by condensation of a compound of formula 1CEMI8.2 in which X1 is halogen or amino, with a compound of formula 1DEMI8.3 in which X2 is halogen or amino, under conditions of hydrogen halide removal. Obviously, whenX1 is halogen, X2 must be amino and X1 is amino, X2 must be halogen for hydrogen halide elimination and compound formation. The amide forming conditions referred to herein, involve the use of known derivatives of the described acids, such as the acyl halides, anhydrides, mixed anhydrides, lower alkyl esters, carbodiimides, carbonyl diimidazoles, and the like. The reactions are carried out in organic solvents such acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, acetic acid, methylene chloride, ethSleSe hlorTde 0and similar such solvents. The amide forming reaction will occur at room temperature or at elevated temperature.The use of elevated temperature is for convenience in that it permits somewhat shortened reaction periods.Temperatures ranging from 0 C. up to the reflux temperature of the reaction system can be used. As a further convenience the amide forming reaction can be effected in the presence of a base such as tertiary organic amines, e.g., trimethylamine, pyridine, picolines and the like, particularly where hydrogen halide is formed by the amide forming reaction, e.g., acyl halide and amino compound. Of course, in those reactions where hydrogen halide is produced, any of the commonly used hydrogen halide acceptors can also be used. In the condensation of an alpha haloacid derivative, similar reaction conditions, solvents and hydrogen halide acceptors can be used as for amide formation. Various substituents on the present new compound can be present in the starting compounds or added after formation of the amide products by the known methods of substitution or conversion reactions.Thus, the nitro group can be added to the final product by nitration of the aromatic ring and the nitro group converted to other groups, such as amino by reduction, and halo by diazotization of the amino group and replacement of the diazo group. Other reactions can be effected on the formed amide product. Amino groups can be alkylated to form mono and dialkylamino groups, mercapto and hydroxy groups can be alkylated to form corresponding ethers. Thus, substitution or alteration reactions can be employed to provide a variety of substituents throughout the molecule of the final products.Of course, reactive groups where present should be protected by suitable blocking groups during any of the aforesaid reactions particularly the condensation reactions to form the amide linkages. The following sequence illustrates a detailed scheme for preparing the products of this invention react a compound of the formula 2 EMI10.1 with compound 3 EMI10.2 wherein A1, A2, m, Y1, R1, Z3 and M3 are as defined hereinabove Y1 is preferably alkoxy to protect against unwanted bond formation at the Y1 site to produce compound 4 EMI10.3 which is reacted with 2,2,2 trichlbrcethyl chlotoformate to protect the nitrogen atom, and the.N protected product reacted with strong HC1 to remove the t butyl esterifying group to form compound 5 EMI11.1 which is reacted with compound 6 EMI11.2 to provide compound 7 . Tbe reaction can be carried out by converting compound 5 to the acid chloride by reaction with oxalyl chloride, and then adding compound 6 . Alternatively, compounds 4 and 6 can be condensed directly, following hydrolysis of the t butyl ester to the acid, in the presence of a suitable coupling agent such as DCC dicyclohexylcarbodiimide or CDI N,N carbonyldiimidazole in a reaction familiar to those of ordinary skill in the peptide syntiesis art . While proceeding via a coupling agent is preferred when the reaction can be made to proceed with a yield higher than that provided by the corresponding acid chloride route, this route s likelihood of success is often determined on a case by case basis thus, in an overall sense the acid chloride route is preferred except where the direct coupling route is found to work better. Compound 6 can be prepared by procedures within the skill of the art. For instance, the amino acidEMI12.1 can be N protected with a carbonylbenzyloxy or similar protecting group, then substituted with the desired Z2M2 at the alpha carbon. The nitrogen is then deprotected and substituted with the desired ZLMI group.EMI12.2 Compound 7 is de N protected with zinc in acetic acid, and then, if desired, ester groups such as in the Y1 and or Y2 position are converted to the free acid with commonly known reagents such as HCl or NaOH. As can be seen in the accompanying Examples, methods are known for converting some but not all of the esterified groups to the acid. Eacb of the above reactions proceeds in a straightforward manner in a suitable solvent at temperatures ranging from OOC. to 150or. The reaction products are sometimes obtained as a mixture of diasteroisomers which can be separated by standard methods of fractional crystallization or chromatography. The compounds of this invention form acid salts with various inorganic and organic acids which are also within the scope of the invention. The pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the compounds of the present invention may be prepared by conventional reactions by reacting the free amino acid or amino ester with an appropriate acid providing the desired anion, either in a solvent or medium in which the salt is insoluble, or in water and removing the water by freezedrying. The salts of strong acids are preferred. As exemplary, but not limiting, of pharmaceutically acceptable acid salts are the salts of hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, nitric, acetic, fumaric, malic, maleic and citric acids. The compounds of this invention also form salts with bases. Suitable such salts include salts with alkali and alkaline earth metals such as sodium, potassium, magnesium and calcium as well as iron, and salts with ammonia and.amines, and quatersn r ar.monium salts. The action of the enzyme renin or angiotensinogen, a pseudoglobulin in blood plasma, produces the decapeptide angio tensin I. Angiotensin I is converted by angiotensin converting enzyme ACE to the octapeptide angiotensin II. The latter lis an active pressor substance which has been implicated as the causative agent in various forms of hypertension in various mammalian species, e.g., rats and dogs. The compounds within the scope of this invention which intervene in the renin to angiotensin I to angiotensin II sequence inhibit angiotensin I converting enzyme and therefore are useful in reducing or relieving hypertension.Furthermore, the compounds within she scope of the present invention which possess diuretic activity promote relief from hypertension by promoting diuresis, and consequently have utility in treating congestive heart failure. Compounds within the scope of the present invention can also simultaneously possess ACE inhibitory and diuretic activity, which is particularly unexpected in view of the fact that such simultaneous activity cannot be predicted from prior art compounds. Thus by the administration of a composition containing one or a combination of compounds of formula 1 of pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, hypertension in the species of mammal suffering therefrom is alleviated.A single dose, or preferably two to four divided daily doses, provided on a basis of about 0.1 to 100 mg per kilogram per day, preferably about 1 to 50 mg per kilogram per day, is appropriate to reduce blood pressure. The substance is preferably administered orally, but a parenteral route such as subcutaneously, intramuscularly, intravenously or intraperitonealy can also be employed. The compounds of the invention can be utilized to achieve the reduction of blood pressure by formulating one or more of them in compositions such as tablets, capsules or elixirs for oral administration or in sterile solutions or suspensions for parenteral administration. About 10 to 500 mg of a compound or mixture of compounds of formula 1 or physiologically acceptable salt s thereof is compounded with a physiologically acceptable vehicle, carrier, excipient, binder, preservative, stabilizer, flavor, etc., in a unit dosage form as called for by accepted pharmaceutical practice. The amount of active substance in these compcsitios tr plepa,ativns is such that a suitable dosage in the range indicated is obtained. Illustrative of the adjuvants which may be incorporated in tablets, capsules and the like are the following a binder such as gum tragacanth, acacia, corn starch or gelatin an excipient such as dicalcium phosphate, a disintegrating agent such as corn starch, potato starch, alginic acid and the like a lubricant such as magnesium stearate a sweetening agent such as sucrose, lactose or saccharin a flavoring agent such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen or cherry. When the dosage unit form is a capsule, it may contain in addition to materials of the above type a liquid carrier such as a fattyoil. Various other materials may be present as coatings or to otherwise modify the physical form of the dosage unit. For instance, tablets may be coated with shellac, sugar or both.A syrup or elixir may contain the active compound, sucrose as a sweetening agent, methyl and propyl parabens as preservatives, a dye and a flavoring such as cberry or orange flavor. Sterile compositions for injection can be formulated according to conventional pharmaceutical practice by dissolving or suspending the active substance in a vehicle such as water for injection, a naturally occurring vegetable oil like sesame oil, coconut oil, peanut oil, cottonseed oil, etc., or a synthetic fatty vehicle like ethyl oleate, and the like.Buffers, preservatives, antioxidants and the like can be incorporated as required.
