# Titanium trichloride catalytic component and process for the homo or co polymerization of alpha olefins.

## Abstract
Preparation of titanium trichloride as compound of a Ziegler type catalyst by a process comprising the following steps first step Reducing titanium tetrachloride with an organic aluminium compound second step treating the resulting reduced solid, which is obtained by the first step, with an organic ether compound third step reacting the treated solid, which is obtained by the second step, with titanium tetrachloride and carrying out the reaction of the first step in a single solvent of an aromatic compound or a mixed solvent of an aliphatic hydrocarbon and an aromatic compound. Use of this compound in the polymerization of alpha olefins.
