# VIBRATION DAMPING SUPPORTS

## Abstract
This invention relates to vibration damping supports and in particular to a suspension unit for a stretcher. The stretcher support unit comprises a rectangular base frame 10 on which is supported, by means of a resilient support mechanism, a stretcher frame or carrier 11 . The support mechanism comprises a pair of cantilever arms 20 inclined upwards in opposite directions and each pivotally mounted at its lower end on the base frame 10 . The movements of the cantilever arms 20 are controlled by respective gas liquid suspension units 30 , which are mounted between the base frame 10 and an extension arm 28 of each cantilever arm 20 . The suspension units comprise, in one embodiment, a gas reservoir 70 , a sealed liquid reservoir 71 , a flexible diaphragm 72 forming one end of the liquid reservoir and an actuator piston 73 . This construction serves to damp the movements of the cantilev er arms 20 and hence the stretcher mounted on the carrier 11 , and also enable the height of the carrier to be varied between a loading position and a position in which the stretcher rides.
