# METHOD FOR FORMING HILLOCK SUPPRESSION LAYER IN DUAL METAL LAYER PROCESSING AND STRUCTURE FORMED THEREBY

## Abstract
A method is provided whereby a thin stop layer 15 of a passive metal is applied uniformly over first layer metalliza tion 12 . The thin stop layer serves as a mechanical stop against the formation of hillocks between the upper surface of the first layer metal line and overlying metal lines 13 . Hillocks are thus not formed on the upper surface of the first layer metal and do not punch through the overlying dielectric regions 11 to contact second layer metallization. An additional advantage of the uniform application of the thin hillock suppression layer on the first layer metal is that an effective barrier layer is provided against the diffusion of contaminants. Furthermore, this method provides the ability to recover the wafers if an error in processing occurs after deposition and processing of the second layer of metalliza tion.
