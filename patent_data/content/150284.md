# Action figure with leg movement derived from arm movement.

## Abstract
The action figure includes two arms mounted to the figure s torso for rocking movement toward the torso about laterally spaced axes, the action figure also including two legs that are mounted for pivotal movement to the torso in a scissors like fashion. Integral with the rockable mounting means for each arm is an inwardly extending shank, the shanks projecting into end portions of a coil spring. When either arm is moved laterally toward the side of the torso, the spring is flexed into a V shaped configuration. A link extends downwardly from the center of the spring so that the flexing action imparted to the spring causes the link to move downwardiy or upwardly. Each unit for pivotally mounting the legs includes a crank pin that is receivable in forwardly and rearwardly located slots at the lower end of the link. The arms can be independently swung from a position adjacent the sides of the figure to overhead or outstretched positions without affecting their ability to oscillate the legs in a scissors like manner and thereby simulate running, swim ming and kicking movements.
