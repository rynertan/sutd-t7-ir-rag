# Microbicidal compositions containing hydroxypropyl methanethiolsulfonate.

## Abstract
A microbicidal composition comprises in admixture a 2 hydroxypropyl methanethiolsulfonate and b a mixture of 5 chloro 2 methyl 4 isothiazolin 3 one and 2 methyl 4 isothiazolin 3 one in a ratio of greater than 50 50 by weight. Aqueous systems incorporating such compositions as well as a method of inhibiting the growth and or prolifera tion of microorganisms in aqueous systems using said com positions are also claimed.
