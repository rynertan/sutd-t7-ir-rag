# Process of human machine interactive educational instruction using voice response verification.

## Abstract
A method of human machine interactive instruction with the aid of a digital computer is disclosed. The first step is providing the computer with a data base of a series of questions and answers which can be reproduced and thereafter individualized by student use by i providing the digital computer with a keyboarded typed question, ii providing the computer with a keyboarded typed answer, iii speaking the correct answer a plurality of times to generate relational signals for master template of the correct answer in digital form, and iv correlating the master template with the corresponding keyboarded typed answer. The second step is providing a human machine voice display interactive tutorial process, by for each question and answer in the data base of questions and answers, sequentially i displaying a typed question, ii displaying the corresponding correct typed answer, iii initiating the articulation of the correct answer by a user, iv processing the so spoken answer by converting it from an audio signal into relational signals in digital form, v determining whether the processed spoken answer in digital form corresponds to the master template for that answer, and vi adjusting the master template to individualize it for the speaker if the processed spoken answer in digital form does not correspond to the master template.
