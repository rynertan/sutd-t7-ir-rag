# Process and apparatus for forming thermoplastic foams having an enlarged cross sectional area by extruding a heat plastified gel into a shaping channel.

## Abstract
Process and apparatus for the preparation of foam articles by extruding a heat plastified foamable gel through a die orifice 14 into a zone of reduced pressure in a shaping channel wherein the gel is supported on a cushion of gas at the die face 24 and at least in the area of the channel near the orifice of the die and a restraining force is applied to the foam in the area where the foam surface has cooled to provide foams having an enlarged cross sectional area.
