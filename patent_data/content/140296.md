# Improved coated polycarbonate articles.

## Abstract
Soft coated shaped polycarbonate articles exhibiting improved resistance of the polycarbonate substrate to degradation by the plasticizers contained in the relatively soft top coat comprised of, in combination i a shaped polycarbonate substrate ii a protective intermediate layer disposed on said polycarbonate substrate comprised of at least one ply of a resinous material exhibiting plasticizer barrier properties, thermoformability, heat resistance, and compatibility with the underlying polycarbonate and iii a relatively soft plasticized top coat comprised of at least one resinous material disposed on said intermediate layer. The substrate, intermediate layer, and top coat are all bonded together by means of suitable adhesives.
