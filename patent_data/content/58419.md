# High purity alumina bodies.

## Abstract
High purity alpha alumina bodies useful as catalyst supports are made by peptizing boehmite alumina in an acidic mixture containing fluoride anions, extruding the peptized alumina into shaped bodies and drying and calcin ing the bodies. The alpha alumina bodies are characterized by a narrow pore size distribution, having 85 percent of the total pore volume comprising pores of a diameter of from 10,000 to 200,000 Angstroms and by a surface area of less than one square meter per gram.
