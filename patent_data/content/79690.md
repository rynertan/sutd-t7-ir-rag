# Apparatus for producing metal vessels.

## Abstract
Metal vessels are produced by lap bonding circumferen tial end portions 3, 4 of pre formed upper and lower metal cup members 1, 2 . A layer 11 of a heat activated adhesive is interposed between the end portions 3, 4 and a non contacting high frequency induction heating means 14 is arranged so that the means 14 covers only a small part of the circumferential portions 3, 4 to be bonded into a seam. When the heating means 14 is energised the circumferen tial end portion 3, 4 and the heating means 14 are rotated relative to one another a number of times.
