# Photoelectric detection device for color sorting apparatus.

## Abstract
A color sorting apparatus has a chute from which grains come out in the form of a linear stream, a photoelectric detec tion device surrounding the stream and including light sources, light receiving units 12 each having a lens barrel 20 having a filter unit 18 and adapted to receive the light re flected by or transmitted through the stream of grains, and a jet nozzle which provides a jet of air in accordance with the sig nal from the light receiving units thereby to blow unwanted grains of different colors away from the stream, so that the de sired grains and unwanted grains are separated from each other according to their colors. The filter unit 18 consists of a plurality of filters 25 carried by a plate member 23, 23A which is movably mounted on the lens barrel.
