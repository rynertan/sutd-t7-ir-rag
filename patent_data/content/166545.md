# A two color electrophotography process.

## Abstract
A developing process for two colored electrophotogra phy comprises 1 charging the surface of a photoreceptor having a conductive substrate and two photosensitive layers successively formed on the conductive substrate, said photo sensitive layers having different spectral sensitivities, 2 charging the surface of said photoreceptor with a different polarity from the charging polarity in step 1 , 3 exposing a two colored original to form electrostatic latent images, which have different polarities corresponding to the two colored original, on the surface of said photoreceptor, 4 transferring a first color toner charged with a different polarity from the charging polarity of one of the electrostatic latent images on said electrostatic latent image to develop said electrostatic latent image with the first color toner, 5 exposing the surface of said photoreceptor to eliminate electric charges with the same polarity as the first color toner which are induced on the surface of said photoreceptor in the vicinity of said electrostat ic latent image developed by the first color toner, and 6 trans ferring a second color toner charged with a different polarity from the charging polarity of the other electrostatic latent image on said other electrostatic latent image to develop said other electrostatic latent image with the second color toner.
