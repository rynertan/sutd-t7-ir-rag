# Dried albedo clouding agent and process therefor.

## Abstract
A process for producing a dried albedo clouding agent which does not impart off flavors to the beverage is disclosed. The process involves heating albedo con taining material which is then ground and treated with a macerating enzyme. The enzyme is then inactivated and coarse particles are filtered out and discarded. The filtrate is centrifuged to obtain the clouding agent which is then washed with water, isopropyl alcohol or a com bination of the two. The clouding agent is dried to obtain a stable product compatible with dry beverage formulas for citrus type beverages.
