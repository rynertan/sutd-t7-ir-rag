# PANEL DISPLAY

## Abstract
A panel display consists of a matrix of picture elements each of which includes with image forming means, e.g. a liquid crystal display element, an electroluminescent display element, a plasma display element or an electrochromic display element, and light sensing means 5 which may be a photoconductor, a photo diode or a phototransistor. The light sensing means of the picture elements constitute an output signal matrix, by which any picture element illumin ated by a light emitting light pen may be readily identified. If required, information stored in the located picture element may be revised.
