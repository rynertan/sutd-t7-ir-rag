## Description
METHOD OF OPERATING A DIESEL ENGINE The invention relates to a method of operating a diesel engine using a fuel consisting wholly or largely of methanol and or ethanol It is known that the use of methanol and ethanol as diesel engine fuels meets with problems caused by the low cetane number of these fuels. These alcohols are too difficult to ignite. A number of solutions to this problem have been proposed. It is possible to preheat the intake air to a temperature of 100 150 C, which, however, necessitates modification of the engine design. It is also possible to add alkylnitrates to the fuel. This causes very severe corrosion and raises the NOx emission.The use of other additives to the fuel, for instance the polyethyleneglycols mentioned in Netherlands Patent Application No. 7713095, can mitigate the problem. However, large amounts of such additives are needed to enable the preheating of the intake air to be omitted altogether. The invention aims at providing an improved method of operating diesel engines on a fuel consisting wholly or largely of methanol and or ethanol. More in particular it aims at providing a method requiring only a small modification of the engine system. According to the invention this object is reached by adding to the air supplied to the combustion chamber s one or more organic compounds possessing a lower auto ignition temperture and or a higher combustion rate than the fuel applied, in an amount sufficient to warrant ignition of the fuel. In this way a diesel engine can be operated without preheating of the intake air. Modifications to the ignition and combustion system are not needed. The addition to the intake air can be realized with simple and reliable equipment that is commercially available. The low air pollution inherent in the use of alcohol as a fuel is retained. The fuel to be used consists to at least 50 by weight, preferably to at least 70 by weight, of methanol, ethanol, or a mixture thereof. There is no objection to the use of a fuel wholly consisting of methanol and or ethanol. Which alcohol will be used can be determined on the basis of availability. As usual, the fuel may contain additives such as corrosion inhibitors, lubricants, stabilizers, colourants, etc. Suitable compounds for use according to the invention are such as possess a low boiling point and a lower auto ignition temperature than m ethanol and or a higher combustion rate than m ethanol. Preferably use is made of compounds containing no other elements than carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. Mention may be made of dimethylether, methoxymethanol ethoxymethanol, methylethylether, diethylether, methylpropylether, dimethoxymethane, and mixtures of two or more of these compounds. The quantity to be used depends on the type of fuel employed and on the preheating of the intake air that may be applied it may, in general, be such that the intake air contains between 0.1 and 7.0 t by volume of the compound in vapour form.In general, the use of amounts between 1.0 and 4.0 by volume already allows of using a fuel without special additives and of omitting preheating of the intake air. The compound or mixture of compounds can be introduced into the intake air by means of an atomizer or vaporizer known in itself. The invention will be explained in the following example, without being restricted to the mode of realization described therein.Example A series produced passenger car equipped with a diesel engine Mercedes 200 D was adapted to the use of the invention. To this end a venturi type evaporator from a standard LPG evaporating system, connected to a storage vessel for the additive, was incorporated in the conduit for the intake air. The additive used was methoxymethanol, and the fuel methanol containing 1 by weight of castor oil by way of lubricant. The car was placed on a rolling road. The temperature of the ambient air was about 18 wC. It proved possible to start the engine and have it run under all loads and at all speeds when quantities of methoxymethanol corresponding to between 2 and 5 vol. of gaseous additive were injected into the intake air. In a standard test with simulation of different engine loads Europe test the performance was found to be virtually equal to those of the sdme car ran on the usual diesel engine fuel, relative to the calorific value of methanol as compared with that of diesel engine fuel . Analogous results can be obtained with the use of diethylether as additive.
