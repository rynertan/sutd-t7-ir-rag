# Transmission control system including select shock suppressing arrangement.

## Abstract
In order to ensure that an adequately high gear ratio such as top gear is engaged momentarily before the first gear ratio and thus reduce select shock when a manual selector valve 2 is moved from neutral N to drive D , while simultaneously enabling the provision of a flow restriction required to ensure smooth automatic upshifting into the high gear in question, a control valve is provided which, in response to the engine associated with the transmission being sensed in an idling condition and the manual selector valve 2 being moved from N to D , boosts the governor pressure up to line pressure level and therefore induces the shift valves 3,4 of the transmission to assume their respective upshift positions. Further, a valve 170 which by passes the flow restriction is provided. This by pass valve 170 assumes a position wherein it by passes the flow restriction and unrestrictedly supplies the shift valve which controls the friction elements which produce the high gear ratio, with line pressure for a brief period prior the pressure fed to the friction units utilized to produce the second speed ratio biasing the by pass valve 170 to a position wherein the flow restriction is no longer by passed and thus effective for shift shock suppression.
