## Description
TITLE MONOTHIOGLYCEROL AS THIOL PROTECTOR IN LYOPHILIZED MATERIALS Description Technical Field This invention relates to thiol protector agents used with sulfhydryl requiring enzymes and more particularly to monothioglycerol as a thiol protector in lyophilized materials. Background Art Certain proteins require the presence of sulfhydryl groups in their structure for activity and stability. In the presence of oxidizing agents, however, including atmospheric oxygen, the sulfhydryl groups are oxidized to disulfide linkages with concomitant deleterious changes in the proteins properties. These problems are magnified when the protein is in serum based material or lyophilized. Addition of excess thiols has been utilized as a means of protection for the sulfhydryl groups of proteins. A large number of thiols has been evaluated for effectiveness as a protective agent against oxidation G. Szasz, Proceedings of theSecond International Symposium on ClincialEnzymology , 1975, pages III 1 to 36 . Szasz examined twenty seven thiol compounds with creatine kinase, an unstable enzyme. Both possible dimercapto 1,3 and 1,2 dimercapto glycerols were tested for their effectiveness but monothioglycerol 1 mercapto or l sulfhydryl 2,3 propanediol was not included in the evaluation. Monothioglycerol MTG, l sulfhydryl2,3 propanediol has been found to be effective for this purpose its half life in solutions in equilibrium with atmospheric oxygen is sufficiently long for practical purposes. However, it has been stated by L. G. Morin, in Clinical Chemistry, Volume 23, No. 9, 1569 1977 , at page 1574 that monothioglycerol would undoubtedly not lyophilize. For this reason, MTG has not been utilized as a sulfhydryl protector in lyophilized materials. G. Szasz, et al. clinical Chemistry,Volume 24, No. 9, 1557 1978 also investigated MTG but observed gelling of the serum proteins, with 50 mM MTG per liter, after six hours storage at 370C.These investigators then selected N acetyl cystein as the protecting agent of choice for creatine kinase isoenzymes. Disclosure of the Invention The lyophilized product of this invention consists essentially of A monothioglycerol, present in the pre lyophilized solution to an extent of not less than approximately 2 mmolesfliter of solution and in an amount not leading to gelation of the solution B sulhydryl requiring enzyme and C substantially completely delipified animal serum having low residual levels of enzyme.activity. This product can be reconstituted without showing any significant adverse temperature of hydration effect affording a product in which the enzyme activity remains substantially constant for 24 hours at 40C. In the improved process for protecting lyophilizable compositions containing sulfhydryl requiring enzymes, which includes the addition of thiol protectors, the improvement comprising the addition of monothioglycerol as the thiol protector. Description of the Invention Certain enzymes are sulfhydryl requiring , that is, they need to maintain their SH groups in their free, unoxidized form. Atmospheric oxygen causes the oxidation of the SH groups to the disulfide S S linkage, thereby diminishing enzyme stability and catalytic activity. Among sulfhydrylrequiring enzymes are yeast alcohol dehydrogenase, glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase, papain, RNA polymerase, acetate thiokinase, and creatine kinase isoenzymes. In contrast, some proteins require disulfide linkages for their activity. Such proteins, for example, ribonuclease, IgG, insulin, do not require thiol protectors during storage and exposure to atmospheric oxygen. Many thiols have been utilized previously as thiol protectors for SH requiring enzymes. Among the best of the thiols for this purpose are N acetyl cystein NAC , glutathione GSH , mercaptoethanol, dithiothreitol, dithioerythritol, and monothioglycerol MTG . Some of these, such as NAC and GSH, have also been incorporated into enzyme solutions and subsequently lyophilized. In the aforementioned review article, comparing some twenty seven thiols as thiol protectors, NAC was found to have optimum overall properties. MTG, however, which has many advantages over other thiols, such as being nonionic and having longer half life than NAC in enzyme solutions, has been said to be unsuitable for incorporation into enzyme solutions which will be lyophilized. It has now been found unexpectedly that the inclusion of MTG into solutions containing SH requiring enzymes leads to lyophilizable products containing such enzymes and a specially prepared human serum matrix. When reconstituted, such products are stable for periods of time sufficient for use in the clinical laboratory. In the lyophilized form, they appear to be stable indefinitely. 2 100 mmoles liter of MTG in the pre lyophilized composition is the useful range of concentration with 20 mmoles liter being a preferred amount. The upper limit is that amount of MTG which does not cause gelation of the composition. From accelerated experiments it is predicted that when the SH requiring enzyme is CKMM, then products containing this isoenzyme, MTG, and a specially prepared serum, which is substantially completely delipified and has low residual levels of enzyme activity, would exhibit little or no detectable loss of enzyme activity in the lyophilized form after one year of storage at 4 20C. For CKMM, the expected range of concentration in the pre lyophilized composition is 20 40 enzyme units liter at the low end of the scale up to approximately 3,000 units liter at the high end. The finding that MTG can be utilized with enzymes to afford lyophilizable product led to unexpected benefits. To be useful as control products in the clinical analysis field, an enzymecontaining lyophilized product must have two characteristics often very difficult to achieve simultaneously. First, there must be substantially no or only very small temperature of hydration effect and, second, there must only be very slight changes in enzyme activity upon standing after reconstitution rehydration of the lyophilized product. The temperature of hydration effect is the phenomenon of variability of recovered enzyme activity from Ã…a lyophilized material upon rehydration caused by the differences in the temperature of water used. For obvious practical purposes, for use in the clinical laboratory, lyophilized products must have a small temperature of hydration effect to permit reproducible analytical results. This temperature of hydration effect is calculated by reconstituting the lyophilized product with water at 20, 25, and 300C, followed by the measurement of enzyme activity of the rehydrated solutions. The slope of the line fitting these data is determined by a least squares calculation to obtain the temperature of hydration effect in enzyme units C. The OC value is calculated from the enzyme activity value of 250C.It is desired that the temperature of hydration effect not exceed 0.5 C. It is further desired that this low temperature of hydration effect be coupled to an enzyme activity change not exceeding 5 during 24 hours standing at 40C after rehydration of the lyophilized material . In a comparison study, the thiol protectorsN acetyl cystein NAC and the subject of this invention, monothioglycerol MTG , were incorporated at various levels into a specially prepared human serum matrix containing creatine kinase MM isoenzyme and various levels of a buffer, 2 amino 2 hydroxymethyl 1,3 propanediol TRIS . The specially prepared substantially completely delipified animal including human serum having low residual levels of enzyme activity and its preparation have been described in U.S. ApplicationsS.N. 045,182, filed June 14, 1979 to A. R. Briggs andS.N. 155,220, filed June 2, 1980 to M. D. du Pont.Both of these applications are hereby incorporated by reference. This serum comprises the bulk of the pre lyophilized composition from which the lyophilized product of this invention is prepared. In this comparison study, the pH of the solutions was adjusted to 7.2 with HC1, the solutions were lyophilized and then rehydrated. Temperature of hydration effect data and those showing the change inCKMM activity upon standing for 24 hr. at 40C are shown below NAC as Thiol Protector Temperature Change inRun of Hydration CKMM no.

As can be seen from the above tables, whileNAC does provide either acceptable temperature of hydration effect or within limits change of enzyme activity, there were no runs which showed acceptable values for both properties simultaneously. On the other hand, the composition of this invention, utilizing MTG as the thiol protector, is acceptable from both standpoints, especially when low levels of buffer are utilized. Higher levels of buffer presumably lead to higher levels of ion concentration which may cause a higher temperature of hydration effect. It was found further that the half life of the SH group of NAC in the specially prepared substantially completely delipified human serum described above is approximately 4 hours when measured in a reconstituted TRIS buffered system pH 7.2 at 16 200C.The comparable SH group half life for MTG in the same system is 22.6 hours, further indicating the superiority of this thiol protector.

Karl Fisher moisture assays carried out on the lyophilized cake like material, see Example, indicated an average moisture content of 0.696 0.075 by weight, which value is in the normal range for lyophilized products in general.Coupled with the data presented above approxiximately 90 of theSH groups are still present upon reconstitution after lyophilization, t 0 , MTG is shown to be a useful thiol protector possessing all of the required characteristics and unexpectedly affording lyophilized products of superior properties. The lyophilized product of this invention can be reconstituted with water to obtain products useful as a calibrator for use in the clinical laboratory. Since the lyophilized product is stable, it can be rehydrated at the appropriate time in the clinical laboratory and used as a control product in conjunction with, for example, automatic clinical analyzers utilized in measuring enzyme activity such as creatine kinase. Example A. Preparation of Pre Lvophilized Product To a 2 liter quantity of human serum prepared according to Example A D of S.N. 155,220 is added 40 mmoles of MTG at room temperature. To this solution is then added a CKMM solution itself having an MTG concentration of 20 mmoles liter , to obtain a final enzyme activity of 816 units liter. This solution is then diluted with an equal volume of water. An assay of this final solution shows an enzyme activity of 426 units liter. B. Preparation of Lyochilized Product The diluted solution from A above is pumped into amber vials, 6.2 ml vial, the vials are placed onto the shelves of a lyophilizer, and the temperature of the shelves is lowered to 200C. The contents of the vials are thus frozen, placed under a 40 80 micron vacuum, and maintained at 200C for 12 hours. After this time period the shelf temperature is allowed to rise to 100C and the vials are kept at this temperature, still under vacuum, for 24 hours. The contents of the vials are finally dried under vacuum for 2 hours at 25at, resulting in a dry cake weighing approximately 197 mg. The vials are sealed under a 40 micron vacuum and stored at 4 20C. The lyophilized product can be tested by rehydrating the contents of a vial with 3 ml. of deionized water and analyzed for enzyme activity change and temperature of hydration effect. Two pilot lots prepared as described above show temperature of hydration effect of 0.128 C and 0.21 C, respectively, well within the desired limit of 0.58 C and 0.8 and 0.85 , respectively, of activity change upon standing. The average freezedried product in a vial contains 2.4 enzyme units ofCKMM 3 ml. of reconstituted solution.
