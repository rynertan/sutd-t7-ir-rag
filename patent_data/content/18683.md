SiO2, wherein M H and alkali metal or alkaline earth metal n the valency of M O y 0.1, a , 0 b , 0, and a b 1. For the adsorption measurements mentioned under c the silicate should first be converted into the H form.This conversion is effected by boilling the silicate calcined at 500 C with 1.0 molar NH4NO3 solution, washing with water, boiling again with 1.0 molar NH4NO3 solution and washing, drying at 1200C and calcining at 5000C. In an investigation by the Applicant concerning the use of the process for the preparation of aromatic hydrocarbon mixtures, which was started from H2 CO mixtures with an H2 CO molar ratio between 0.25 and 0.75, the stability of the catalyst mixture was found to be unsatisfactory. Further investigation by the Applicant concerning this subject showed that addition of water to the H2 CO mixture in an amount of at least 2.5 fim, based on theH2 CO mixture. may yield a considerable improvement of the stability of the catalyst mixture. It has further been found that addition of water to these low hydrogen H2XCO mixtures in an amount which does not exceed a cer tain value, may yield a considerable improvement of the conversion of these H2 CO mixtures.The maximum amount of water that can be added to the H2 CO mixture with a view to improving the conversion of the H2 CO mixture at a given temperature, pressure, space velocity and catalyst mixture is dependent on the H2 CO molar ratio of the feed and on the consumption ratio of the H2 CO mixture when the process is carried out under the conditions given, without water addition. The maximum amount of water in m. based on the H2 CO mixture, is given by the formula 3 V R 1 R 1 v wherein V the consumption ratio of the H2 CO mixture when the process is carried out without water addition, and R the H2 CO molar ratio of the feed. The present patent application therefore relates to a process for the preparation of an aromatic hydrocarbon mixture in which a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen with an H2 CO molar ratio between 0.25 and 0.75 is contacted with a mixture of two catalysts of which one is capable of catalysing the conversion of an H2 CO mixture into acyclic oxygen containing hydrocarbons and the other is a crystalline silicate as defined above, and in which to the H2 CO mixture an amount of water is added which in m. based on the H2 CO mixture is at least 2.5 and at most 3 V R For determining the maximum amount of water that can be added at a given temperature. pressure, space velocity and catalyst mixture to an H2 CO mixture with a given R between 0.25 and 0.75, in order to obtain an improved stability of the catalyst mixture and an improved conversion of the H2 CO mixture, V should be known. This parameter can be found in a simple way with the aid of an experiment carried out under the conditions given, but without water addition. V is calculated with the formula CH2 V x R, CCO wherein CH2 and CO are the initial conversions found in the experiment for H2 and CO, respectively. With regard to the amount of water that can be added to the H2JCO mixture the following remark should be made. If in the experiment, under given conditions without water addition, for V a value is found such that the formula 3 V R yields a value smaller 1 R 1 V than 2.5, this means that it is not possible under the given conditions to reach an improvement of the conversion of the H2SCO mixture by adding water in an amount of more than 2.5 Xm, based on the H2 CO mixture. The invention does not hold for situations in which the for mula 3 V R yields a value lower than 2.5. 1 R 1 V These situations are therefore outside the scope of the present patent application. In the process according to the invention an amount of water should be added to the H2 CO mixture which in fim, based on the H2 CO mixture is at least 2.5 and at most 3 V R 1 R 1 In view of the improvement to be achieved in the conver sion of the H2 CO mixture it is preferred to add an amount of water which in m, based on the H2 CO mixture lies between and 1.1 V R and 1.9 V and in 1 R 1 V and R 1 V particular between 1.3 V R and 1.7 V R 1 R 1 V 1 R 1 V In the process according to the invention the starting material is an H2 CO mixture with a molar ratio between 0.25 and 0.75.

CatalystA is the catalyst which is capable of catalysing the conversion of an H2 CO mixture into acyclic oxgen containing hydrocarbons and catalyst B is the crystalline silicate. Catalysts that are preferably used as A catalysts are those which are capable of converting an H2 CO mixture into substantially methanol and or dimethyi ether.If in the process according to the invention the aim is to prepare a product consisting substantially of hydrocarbons boiling in the gasoline range, a catalyst which contains zinc together with chromium can very suitably be used as the A catalyst. llhen using such a catalyst, it is preferred to choose one in which the atomic percentage of zinc, based on the sum of zinc and chromium, is at least 60 and in particular 60 80 . If in the process according to the invention the aim is to prepare, in addition to hydrocarbons boiling in the gasoline range, a fuel gas with a high calorific value, a catalyst which contains zine together with copper can very suitably be used as the A catalyst. The catalyst mixture that is used in the process according to the invention may be a macromixture or a micromixture.In the first case the catalyst mixture consists of two kinds of macroparticles, of which one kind consists completely of catalyst A, and the other kind completely of catalyst B. In the second case the catalyst mixture consists of one kind of macroparticles, each macropartlcle being built up of a great number of microparticles of each of the catalysts A andB. Catalyst mixtures in the form of micromixtures may be prepared, for instance, hv thoroughly mixing a fine powder of catalyst A with a fine powder of catalyst B and shaping the mixture into larger particles, for instance by extruding or tabletting.In the process according to the invention it is preferred to use catalyst mixtures in the form of micromixtures In view of the activity of the catalyst mixtures, preferred mixtures are those containing per part by volume of catalyst B, 1 5 parts by volume of catalyst A. The crystalline silicate that is present in the catalyst mixtures as catalyst B, has been defined, inter alia. with reference to the X rav powder diffraction pattern shown by the silicate after 1 hour s calcining in air at 5000C. This X ray powder diffraction pattern should contain, inter alia. the reflections shown inTable A.

The letters used in Table B for describing the reflections have the following meanings SP sharp SR shoulder NL normal BD broad g angle according to Bragg. The crystalline silicates which are used in the catalyst mixtures can be prepared from an aqueous mixture as the starting material which contains the following compounds one or more compounds of an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal M , one or more compounds containing an organic cation R or from which such a cation is formed during the preparation of the silicate, one or more silicon compounds and one or more aluminium and or iron compounds. The preparation is performed by maintaining the mixture at elevated temperature until the silicate has been formed and subsequently separating the crystals of the silicate from the mother liquor.In the preparation of the silicates it is preferred to start from a base mixture in which M is present in a sodium compound and R in a tetrapropylammonium compound. The silicates prepared in the way described above contain alkali metal ions and or alkaline earth metal ions and organic cations. By using suitable exchange methods the alkali metal ions and alkaline earth metal ions can be replaced by other cations. such as hydrogen ions or ammonium ions. Organic cations can be very sul tably converted into hydrogen ions by calcining the silicates. The crystalline silicates which are used in the catalyst mixtures preferably have an alkali metal content of less than 0.1 fiw and in particular less than 0.01 fiw. If desired, a binder material such as bentonite or kaolin may be incorporated into the catalyst mixtures. In view of the stability of the catalyst mixtures, in the process according to the invention preference is given to crystalline silicates with an average crystallite size of less than 3000 nm and in particular less than 1000 nm. The average crystal7ite size of the silicates can be adjusted with the aid of the molar ratio of R 2 p0 wherein p represents the valency of R to SiO2 in the starting mixture. in the sense that silicates with a lower average crystallite size are obtained according as the molar ratio of R 2 p 0 to SiO2 in the starting mixture is chosen higher. If in the process according to the invention the aim is to reach a high C5 selectivity, this can be realized in three ways by choosing the crystalline silicate in the catalyst mixture. In the first place a crystalline silicate may be used to this end for which holds that a 1. Further, a crystalline silicate may be used for which holds that a 0 and y 0.005. Finally. a crystalline silicate may be used for which holds that a 0 and y 0.005, which silicate contains, in addition, one or more elements selected from the group formed by manganese, calcium. magnesium and titanium.The value of y in the formula which gives the composition of the silicates can be adjusted with the aid of the molar ratio of SiO2 on the one hand to Al 0 and ow Fe203 on the other hand in 23 23 the starting mixture, in the sense that silicates with a lower value for y are obtained according as the molar ratio of SiO2 on the one hand to Awl 203 and or Foe 203 on the other hand in the starting mixture is chosen higher. The process according to the invention can very suitably be carried out by conducting the feed in upward or downward direction through a vertically mounted reactor, in which a fixed or a moving bed of the catalyst mixture concerned is present. The process may. for instance, be carried out by conducting a feed in upward direction through a vertically mounted catalyst bed.using such a gas rate that expansion of the catalyst bed occurs If desired, the process can also be carried out using a suspension of the catalyst mixture in a hy drocarbon oil. Depending on whether the process is carried out with a fixed catalyst bed, an expanded catalyst bed or a catalyst suspension, preference is given to catalyst particles with a diameter between 1 and 5 mm, 0.5 and 2.5 mm and 20 and 150 m, respectively.
