# CONNECTOR USING A SHAPE MEMORY ALLOY MEMBER

## Abstract
A connecter has thin sheets 2 of shape memory alloy on a surface of a substrate 1 , positioned such that the sheets 2 project over a hole in the substrate. A pin 3 is inserted into the hole with the temperature being such that the sheets 2 are easily deformed. A suitable change of temperature causes the sheets 2 to attempt to return to their original shape, thereby establishing a good electrical connection between the sheets 2 and the pin 3 . Another change of temperature causes the sheets 2 to stop trying to return to their original shape, making it easy to remove the pin 3 . This arrangement makes possible a reliable connector which may easily be made small.
