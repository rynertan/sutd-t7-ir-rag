# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR ASEPTIC SAMPLING OF FERMENTATION LIQUOR FROM A FERMENTATION TANK

## Abstract
According to the method and apparatus of the invention a fermentation liquor is aseptically sampled by withdrawing a recycle stream of fermentation medium from the fermenta tion vessel 1 , passing the recycle stream through a closed tubular loop 4 back into the fermentation vessel, the loop having at least one tubular section 3 constructed of a porous filter material permeable to the liquor, but not by the culture microorganism or other solids. Liquor which filters through the porous tubular section is collected as the sample. Internally the tubular section is kept free of deposits clogging the filter by the flow of liquid around the recycle loop.
