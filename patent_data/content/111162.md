## Description
ENCAPSULATED, SHIELDED, AND GROUNDED CONNECTOR BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Encapsulated, shielded, and grounded connectors are often used in power or control circuit applications requiring a high level of electrical and mechanical integrity. Such connectors usually provide both mechanical and electrical connection to an electrically operated device or to a similar connector for purposes of quick disconnect. Known connectors generally have a plurality of male terminals that are accepted in complementary female sockets in a mating connector.The terminals and sockets are generally surrounded by a metal enclosure which is attached mechanically and electrically to the electrical shielding and ground wire of a cable. Such known connectors utilize a soldered connection between terminal case and the grounding wire or metallic sheath of the cable. The area between the point of mechanical attachment of the connector to the cable and the metallic enclosure surrounding the terminals has heretofore been sheathed in a conductive material, for example, copper or aluminum foil which has been soldered to both the ground wire and to the metallic enclosure surrounding the terminals. The individual conductors of the cable are first encapsulated for structural rigidity and thereafter wrapped with foil to insure proper shielding of the wires from external electrical disturbance. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An encapsulated, shielded, and grounded connector, in accordance with an exemplary constructed embodiment of the instant invention, features a metal housing that provides structural support for the terminals of the connector as well as providing for grounding and shielding of the electrical conductors between the end of the cable and the metallic enclosure surrounding the terminals of the connector. The housing is encapsulated in a non conductive sheath, for example, PVC, Nylon, fluoropolymer, Teflon, etc. The metal housing provides significant structural integrity that facilitates mounting of the connector to an electrically operated device or mating connector. The structural configuration of the metallic housing accommodates various orientations of a crimping sleeve thereby to orientate the cable at one of several angles relative to the connector housing. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING5 Figure 1 is an elevational view of an encapsulated, shielded, and grounded connector in accordance with the instant invention. Figure 2 is an enlarged view of the connector of Fig. 1, partially broken away for purposes of explanation. Figure 3 is a view of a modified housing for the connector of Fig. 1. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION As seen in Fig. 1 of the drawings, an encapsulated, shielded, and grounded connector 10 comprises an outer sheath 12 of insulating material, for example,PVC, Nylon, fluoropolymer, etc., having an end portion 14 that surrounds and supports a multi conductor cable 16. An opposite end portion 18 of the connector 10 is provided with attachment pins 20 and 22 to facilitate attachment of the connector 10 to an electrically energized device or, alternatively, to a complementary connector not shown . In accordance with the present invention, as best seen in Fig. 2 of the drawings, the connector 10 is provided with a metal inner housing 30 comprising, for example, a metal stamping. The housing 30 has convergent portions 32 and 34 at one end thereof terminating in a lateral section 36. The lateral section 36 has an aperture 38 therein for the acceptance of a crimping sleeve 40. The sleeve 40 has a folded end flange 42 that extends through the aperture 38 and which is mechanically secured thereabout. The flange 42 is secured within the aperture 38 in a manner that provides an electrical connection between the crimping sleeve 40 and housing 30 as well as a rigid mechanical interconnection. It is to be noted that the cable 16 is pro vided with an insulating outer sheath 50 and a braided metallic sheath 52. The sheath 52 functions as a pro tective enclosure, a grounding connector, and as an electrical shield. The sheath 52 is folded over a metal sleeve 53 of substantially the same inside diameter as the outer sheath 50 of cable 16. The braided metal sheath 52 and sleeve 53 are crimped to the housing 30 by detents 54 and 56 in the sleeve 40 which provide a mechanical and electrical connection therewith. The housing 30 is provided with laterally outwardly extending flanges 60 and 62 at the opposite end thereof from the sleeve 40 for the acceptance of the locking pins 20 and 22. In addition to providing for attachment to an electrical device or complementary connector, the pins 20 and 22 secure a pair of laterally extending flanges 64 and 66 of a metallic terminal enclosure 68 to the flanges 60 and 62 of the housing 30. Thus, total electrical continuity and shielding is provided by the housing 30 in conjunction with the terminal enclosure 68. A pair of metallic sleeves 70 and 72 having internally threaded bores 74 and 76 for the acceptance ot the pins 20 and 22, are welded to flanges 60 and 62 of housing 30 and thereafter molded into the outer sheath 12, as will be described. After the sleeve 40 of the housing 30 is crimped to the cable 16, the entire assembly, including the pin sleeves 70 and 72, is placed within a mold and the insulating sheath 12 is molded thereabout. In this manner, a structurally integrated assembly that has a high level of electrical and mechanical integrity is achieved. As best seen in Fig. 3 of the drawings, the crimping sleeve 40 extends from the convergent wall 34 of the housing 30. Both mechanical and electrical continuity is achieved housing in the manner discussed hereinbefore. However, the angular orientation of the wall 34 and sleeve 40 provides for angular orientation of the cable 16 relative to the housing 30. In this manner, a single housing stamping 30 can be utilized for a plurality of applications by locating the aperture 38 for the sleeve 40 in either the transverse end wall 36, as illustrated in Fig. 2, or one of the angularly related walls 32 or 34, as illustrated in Fig. 3. While the preferred embodiment of the invention has been disclosed, it should be appreciated that the invention is susceptible of modification without departing from the scope of the following claims.
