# NOISE REDUCTION CIRCUIT

## Abstract
A noise reduction circuit for reducing noise in video signal comprises delay circuits 5,6 for delaying an output video signal for delay time 2S and H S H denotes one horizontal scanning period and S denotes a half of one period of the color subcarrier , an average circuit 7 for averaging the outputs of the delay circuits, a subtraction circuit 2 for substracting the output of the average circuit from an input video signal, an attenuation circuit 3 for attenuating the output of the subtraction circuit, an addition circuit 4 for adding the output of the attenuation circuit to the input video signal, and an edge detection circuit 8 for detecting the edge of pattern in the input video signal. The attenuation factor of the attenuation circuit is set into zero when the edge of pattern is detected.
