# Channel number priority assignment apparatus.

## Abstract
A data processing system has a system bus network which includes a distributed priority network for transfer ring data asynchronously between a number of subsystems which couple to the bus. Each subsystem includes priority logic circuits coupled to receive a group of priority signals from the priority network which establish when the subsys tem has the highest priority of the requesting subsystems to access the bus. The number of subsystems include a plural ity of identical subsystems, each of which has a channel number assignment apparatus. The apparatus of each identical subsystem is connected to receive the same of at least one of the group of priority signals. During the idle state of the system bus, the apparatus of each identical sub system operates to store a unique state of the priority signal which is defined as a function of the subsystem s position on the bus thereby automatically establishing a unique chan nel number value for each identical subsystem.
