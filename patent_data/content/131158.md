# Rotary compressor.

## Abstract
A rotary compressor is provided with a rotary sleeve 30 mounted in a center housing 22 for rotation with a plurality of vanes 16 movable in a rotor 10 which is eccentrically disposed in the rotary sleeve. An air bearing room 40 is defined between the outer periphery of the rotary sleeve and the inner periphery of the center housing and supplied with air through an inlet 71 internally connected to the discharge chamber or compression working space under the maximum pressure. A multiplicity of air accumulating grooves 32 are formed in either or both in the outer periphery of the rotary sleeve and the inner periphery of the center housing. The air accumulating groove 32 is composed of a suc tion portion 32a gradually inclined from the peripheral direc tion and a compression portion 32b sharply inclined from or perpendicular to the peripheral direction. The inlet is peripherally alined with the suction portion 32a of each air accumulating groove, so that air is guided to the suction portion and compressed in the compression portion of the groove to increase the bearing effect of the air bearing room.
