# Piezoelectric stepping rotator.

## Abstract
The rotator comprises a piezoelectric bender 4 pivotally supported 2, 3 at one end and carrying a clamping means 6 to which a payload 7 may be attached. The bender 4 has split electrodes to keep its ends parallel when energized. Normally engaging the clamping means 6 are clamping members 15, 17 attached to a pair of piezoelectric benders 10, 11 which are fixed in supports 12, 13 resting on a base plate 1 . With the pair of benders 10, 11 energized, the clamping means 6 is released and energization of the central bender 4 results in the lifting of the payload 7 by one step. The clamping means 6 is then re arrested and its pivot 2, 3 released by reversing the polarities at the pair of benders 10, 11 , and the central bender 4 is permitted to stretch. the rotator is then prepared for the next step of rotation about the pivot 2 . This embodiment permits rotation through about 15 degrees. Two further embodiments conceived for unlimited rotation are described.
