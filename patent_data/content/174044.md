# High heat metal polymer laminate.

## Abstract
A novel metal polymer metal structural laminate having an unexpected balance of property advantages, the polymer comprising a blend of an engineering thermoplastic resin and a selectively hydrogenated monoalkenylarene conjugated diene block copolymer, so as to form a con tinuous interlocking network.
