## Description
Luminescent silicate, luminescent screens and lamps comprising such a luminescent silicate. The invention relates to a luminescent silicate of an alkaline earth metal together with yttrium and or lanthanum. In addition, the invention relates to a luminescent screen comprising such a luminescent silicate and to a low pressure mercury discharge lamp having such a luminescent screen. Luminescent silicates of an alkaline earth metal together with yttrium or lanthanum are known fromNetherlands Patent Application 7005708 PHN 4817 . Said application describes such silicates, the crystal structure of which corresponds to the crystal structure of apatite. Efficiently luminescing materials are obtained on activation of these materials by antimony, lead and or tin. The publication of Dokl. Akad. Nauk SSSR 243 1978 , 891 discloses a number of silicates which are defined by the formula Me3IIMe2III Si6O18, wheren MeII represents Sr or Ca and Me represents Y or an element of the lanthanum series. It appears that these compounds are crystalline materials having a triclinic crystal structure. Object of the invention is to provide novel luminescent materials which have very advantageous properties when used in a luminescent screen. According to the invention a luminescent silicate of an alkaline earth metal together with yttrium and or lanthanum is characterized in that the silicate has a composition defined by the formula Me3 p q Pbp Mnq In2 r x y z GdrCex Tby Dyz Si6 O18 wherein Me represents strontium and or calcium and Ln represents yttrium and or lanthanum, wherein, if q r x y z O, it holds that 0.01 p 0.50 wherein, if p q y z O, it holds that 0.01 x 0.80 and O r 2 x, wherein, if q x y z O it holds that 0.01 p 0.50 and 0.05 r 2.0 and wherein otherwise it holds that 0.01 p 0.50 0.05 r 2 x y z 0 q 0.30 0 x 0.80 0 y 1.0 0 z 0.10 0.005 q xty z It appeared that from the group of silicate compounds having a triclinic crystal structure the silicates of Sr and or Ca together with Y and or La are suitable host lattices for activation by at least one of the elements Pb, Mn, Gd, Ce, Tb and Dy. The luminescent materials then obtained can be properly excited, for examply by ultra violet radiation, in particular by short wave ultra violet radiation, and then luminesce in a very efficient manner.The choice of the elements to be used for Me and for Ln do nt appear to be critical as these elements have very little influence on the luminescent properties. The above mentioned activators can be used alone or combine, very different emissions being obtained, which are very advantageous for practical uses, depending on the choice of the activator s . The concentrations of the activators, denoted by the indices p, q, r, x, y and z, are located within predetermined limits.In order to obtain a sufficient absorption of excitation energy and or a sufficiently high quantum efficiency an activator is not used in a concentration below a predetermined minimum value. A predetermined maximum concentration of an activator is not exceeded to avoid the radiation efficiency from being reduced unacceptably by concentration quenching. If the silicates are activated by lead alone q r x y z O materials are obtained having very short wave length lead emission with a maximum at approx. 302 nm. The lead which replaces a portion of the Me is then chosen in a concentration, p, of,not less than 0.01 and not more than 0.50. On activation by cerium along p q y z O materials are obtained which emit in the near part of the ultraviolet spectrum with a maximum of the emission band at 385 0 nm. It appeared that these materials may contain gadolinium 04 ri 2 x as this element does not act as an activator element for these materials, but may occur as a lattice component in a Ln site . The cerium concentration, x, is chosen in the range from 0.01 to 0.80. Silicates according to the invention which cCjn tain both lead and gadolinium are very efficient emitters of the characteristic Gd radiation line emission at approximately 313 nm . In these materials the excitation energy, for example the 254 nm radiation of a low pressure mercury vapour discharge lamp, is absorbed by the lead and is transferred to the gadolinium. The lead content, p, is again chosen in a range from 0.01 to 0.50. The gadolinium content, r, may be chosen between very wide limits 0.05 r 2 as then concentration quenching does not occur to a substantial extent. On activation of the silicates by a third ac activator element Mn, Ce, Tb and or Dy in addition to Pb 0.014 pg 0.50 and Gd 0.05g rg 2 x y z materials are obtained having the characteristic emission of the third activator element, the minimum value of the concentration of this third activator element being 0.005 q, x, y or z .In these materials the Gd plays an intermediate part in the transfer of excitation energy of the Pb to the third activator element via Gd. If Mn is chosen as the third activator, the Mn content q being not more than 0.30, materials are obtained having a green emission band with a maximum at approximately 550 nm. The use of cerium x 0.80 as the third activator produces materials which furnish the Ce emission in the near ultra violet, the same as the silicates which contain only Ce or Ce together withGd. In those cases where a relatively low Ce content is opted for, it appears that materials containing also Pb and Gd are more efficient than the materials which containCe only.If terbium y 41.0 is chosen as the third activator, very efficiently luminescing materials are obtained, which have the characteristic green terbium emission. The use of dysprosium zS 0.1 as the third activator produces materials having an efficient white dysprosium emission predominantly an emission band in the yellow and, furthermore, a band in the blue part of the spectrum. A first embodiment of a luminescent silicate according to the invention is therefore characterized in that the silicate has a composition defined by the formulaMe3 p Pbp Ln2 Si6 O18, wherein 0.03 p 0.25. These materials, which only contain lead as the activator are, particularly with lead contents between 0.03 and 0.25, very efficient radiators having a relatively narrow emission band half value width approximately 40 nm with a maximum at approximately 302 nm. They can therefore be used to great advantage in the luminescent screen of low pressure mercury vapour discharge lamps for photo chemical purposes, for example for the generation of erythema. According to the invention, a second embodiment of a luminescent silicate is characterized in that the silicate has a composition defined by the formulaMe3 p Pbp Ln2 r Gdr Si6 O18, wherein 0.01 p 0.50 and 0.50 Xrg 2.0. The lead and gadolinium activated silicates emit in a particularly efficient manner the characteristicGd radiation, especially at relatively high Gd contents r between 0.50 and 2.0 . These materials are used in the luminescent screen of low pressure mercury vapout discharge lamps for photo chemical purposes, particularly in such lamps for radiation purposes, for example the photo therapy of skin diseases, such as psoriasis. A third embodiment of a luminescent silicate according to the invention is characterized in that O r 42 x 0.05 x 0.50 and furthermore p q y z O.These silicates, which are only activated by Ce and which may possibly contain Gd are used in the luminescent screen of low pressure mercury vapour discharge lamps for special purposes, for example in photo copying apparatus, because they luminesce very efficiently in a band in the near ultra violet and blue portion of the spectrum, particularly when x is chosen between 0.05 and 0.50. A further advantageous embodiment of a luminescent silicate according to the invention is characterized in that 0.01 p 0.50 0.05 r 2 y 0.05 yX 0.75 and furthermore q x z O.Very high luminous fluxes are obtained on activation of the silicates by Pb, Gd and Tb, particularly for Tbcontents between 0.05 and 0.75. These green luminescing silicates are used in the luminescent screen of low pressure mercury vapour discharge lamps for special purposes, for example for electro photography, or in combination with a red and a blue luminescing material in such lamps for general lighting purposes. Another embodiment of a luminescent silicate according to the invention is characterized in that 0.01 p 0.50 0.05 r 2 z 0.0053 z4 0.08 q x y O.The silicates activated by Pb, Gd and Dy are efficient, substantially white light emitting materials, particularly with Dy contents of 0.005 to 0.08. A luminescent screen provided with such a material can be used with great advantage in low pressure mercury vapour discharge lamps for general lighting purposes. A still further embodiment of a luminescent silicate according to the invention is characterized in that 0.01 p 0.50 0.05 r 2 0.005 q 0.15 x y Z O. Activation of the silicates by Pb, Gd and Mn, particularly with Mn contents of 0.005 to 0.15 provides very efficient, green emitting materials. The Mn2 emission in these materials appears to be a relatively long wave emission emission maximum at 540 to 550 nm , which can be very advantageous for practical uses. Such a luminescent silicate can be used in the luminescent screen of low pressure mercury vapour discharge lamps for special purposes, such as electro photography. These silicates may also be used as the green component in low pressure mercury vapour discharge lamps for general used lighting purposes. Some embodiments of the invention will now be described and further explained with reference to the accompanying drawing and a number of measurements. In the drawing Figure 1 shows the spectral energy distribution of the emitted radiation of three luminescent silicates according to the invention and Figure 2 shows the emission spectrum of three further silicates according to the invention. In theFigures 1 and 2 the maximum of each emission spectrum is set at 100.Example 1.A mixture is made of 3.003 g CaCO3 1.784 g 203 3.786 g SiO2 5 mole 0A in excess 0.723 g CeO2. 0This mixture was heated for 0.75 hour at 1250 C in a weakly reducing atmosphere. After cooling and pulverizing, the fired product was heated again for 3 hours at 1350 C in a weakly reducing atmosphere. After cooling, the product obtained was pulverized and mixed with 0.15 by weight ofNH4F and was then fired for one hour at 1350 C in a weakly reducing atmosphere. The product thus obtained was a luminescent, Ce activated silicate having a composition defined by the formula Ca3 Y1.58 Ce0.42 Si6 O18 with a triclinic crystal structure. The use of a slight excess of Si02 and a very small quantity of NH4F, as indicated above, promotes the reaction.On excitation by the shortwave ultra violet radiation from a low pressure mercury vapour discharge lamp predominantly 254 nm , the silicate luminesced efficiently quantum efficiency approximately 53 in a band having a maximum max at 395 nm and a half value width of approximately 70 nm. The peak height P of the emission band was 31 of the peak height of the known, lead activated barium disilicate BaSi2O5 Pb used as a standard in this measurement. The emission spectrum of the silicate is shown in Figure 1 by means of curve 1. In this Figure the wavelength in nm is plotted on the horizontal axis and the emitted radiation energy E in arbitrary units on the vertical axis. A large number of Ce activated silicates were prepared in a similar manner to that described in Example 1.
