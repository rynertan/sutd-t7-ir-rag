# Method and apparatus for drying tubular knitted fabric.

## Abstract
The disclosure relates to techniques for high efficiency drying of wet processed tubular knitted fabric. The wet tub ular fabric 11 is initially spread to flat form and then guided in a controlled manner over a so called Mach nozzle 24 , at which high velocity gaseous medium, usually steam, at speeds approaching the speed of sound and above, is dis charged directly through the fabric, which is maintained in tension as it passes over the nozzle outlet. The thus treated tubular knitted fabric, now with a greatly reduced liquid content, is then immediately directed over a second spreader device, which distends the fabric widthwise to a pretermined, uniform width, to restore the fabric width lost during wet processing and during the relatively high tension nozzle treating operation. In this damp, geometrically sta bilized condition, the fabric may be directed immediately into an otherwise conventional tensionless dryer for tubular kitted fabric, where the necessary final drying operations are completed. More typically, the fabric is loosely folded and then dried later. Significant production economies are realized pursuant to the invention, both in energy savings and labor savings, as well as reduction in capital equipment costs. The process also makes wet on wet foam processing relatively attractive for certain tubular knitted fabrics.
