# Improved expansible tube type valve.

## Abstract
An expansible tube valve has a flexible tube 30 stretched around a circular barrier 28 between inlet and outlet slots 22, 24 and is conditioned to enable flow in an annular path around the barrier when upstream pressure overcomes pressure in a control jacket 41 around the tube. A second flow path directly through the barrier is normally closed off by a poppet valve 48 engageable with a seat 44 around the passage. A spring 64 augmented by a control pressure biases the valve toward closed position and is preferably set so that, only after capacity of the flexible tube valve is reached or approached, does the poppet valve open to answer the need for high pressure demand downstream or for relief of a high pressure surge upstream.
