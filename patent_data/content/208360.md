# A DEVICE FOR YAW STEERING OF AIRCRAFT

## Abstract
A device for control in yaw of an aircraft with a slender nose 3 , especially for supersonic speed at high angles of attack, at speeds especially up to Mach 0.5, distinguished in that ports 5, 6 are arranged in both sides of the nose portion of the aircraft, spaced from its plane of symmetry, with the ports so arranged with controllably variable position in the two sides of the nose portion that at least one port in one side, standing in flow connec tion with at least one port in the other side, causes such an asymmetrical discharge of body nose air vortices from the sides that by reason of the thus arising pressure difference between the two sides a controllable yaw moment is obtained.

## Claims
1. Device for an aircraft, particularly for supersonic speed, comprising a central elongated body with a nose, wherein the relationship between the length of the nose and its width is greater than 1.5 and the aircraft is sub stantially symmetrical to a symmetry plane, for control in yaw, that is, about an axis at right angles to the longitu dinal symmetry axis of the body in said symmetry plane, at high angles of attack α, that is, the angle between the longitudinal symmetry axis of the body and the prevailing wind vector, at speeds especially up to Mach 0.5, charac terized in that ports are arranged in both sides of the nose portion of the body, spaced from the symmetry plane, which ports are so arranged with controllably variable po sitions at the two sides of the nose portion that at least one port at one side, connected with at least one port at the other side, causes such an aymmetrical discharge of body nose air vortices from the sides that by reason of the pressure difference thus arising between the two sides a controllable yaw moment is obtained.

## Description
The present invention relates to a device for yaw control of an aircraft with a slender nose at high angle of attack and speeds especially up to Mach 0.5. The nose can be pointed or more or less rounded. In the flight of such aircraft, such as airplanes and guided missiles, with high angle of attack, that is, angle between the longitudi nal symmetry axis of the aircraft and the existing wind vector, in the range of 20 80 , most notably 35 70 , a problem arises in controlling the aircraft in yaw, that is, to impose upon the aircraft a controlling yaw moment about an axis at right angles to its longitudinal sym metry axis in its plane of symmetry. The reason is that the body and supporting surfaces of the aircraft increas ingly with increasing angles of attack are located be tween the wind vector and the active control surfaces of the aircraft, that is, the rudder. Under these conditions, even a large rudder angle δ In an alternative embodiment the ports are arranged with stepwise controllably variable positions, for example, by having several ports arranged in each of the two sides of the nose portion, selectably connectable with one an other. In this the ports in one side of the nose portion are connected with the ports in the other side by means of passages provided with controllable closure means such as flaps. The ports themselves can take various forms, but circular ports or ports in the form of elongated slots, with their longitudinal axis parallel to the longitudinal axis of the nose portion, would seem to be suitable. It is suitable to provide the ports with controllable closures, so that the drag during flight at high speeds is eliminated by keeping the ports closed in such flying to the extent that the device according to the invention need not be made use of for active yaw control. The invention is more particularly described with ref erence to the accompanying drawings, wherein In Fig. 1 is shown how the rudder effect for an air craft, in this case an airplne with a fin 1 provided with a rudder 2, varies with increasing angle of attack α. In the figure the range 35 70 is marked. Within that range occur unctrolled flow conditions about a slender nose on an aircraft which make themselves known by asymmetrical dis charge of air vortices from both sides of the nose portion, spaced from the plane of symmetry. In the diagram the rud der effect is given by The ports 5 and 6 are connected by a passage 8 that admits a flow of air. The prevailing wind vector is desig nated by 9. In Fig. 3 the device according to the invention occupies a neutral position, which means that it does not exert any active controlling force beyond its effect of equalizing possible stochastically arising asymmetric flow conditions that arise within the range α 20 80 , most notably 35 70 , which is marked in Fig. 1. If, however, the device is turned as in Fig. 5, there is active ly produced an asymmetrical flow relationship around the nose portion 3, so that through the asymmetry of the dis charge of air vortices 10 and 11 from the nose portion 3, a side force 12 arises which produces a controlling yaw moment. In Fig. 6 is shown how a corresponding right hand rotation of the device according to the invention produces corresponding asymmetrical air vortices 13, 14 and a side force 15 arising therefrom that has an opposite direction compared with the side force 12. In Fig. 11 is shown, in the upper half of the diagram, the yaw moment that is pro duced by the mention left hand rotation of the device, as a function of the angle of attack α, and in the lower half of the diagram the corresponding effect of a right hand ro tation of the device. The device shown in Fig. 3 and 4 is continuously rotat able, which means that a desired yaw moment for a certain angle of attack can be obtained through a corresponding ro tation of the device about its longitudinal axis. In Figs. 7a, 7b and 8 is shown an alternative embodi ment of a device according to the invention particularly for stepwise controllable variation of the positions of the parts. The illustrated arrangement presents two ports 16, 18 in one side of the nose portion and two ports 17, 19 in its other side. Ports 16 and 17 are connected with one another by means of a straight passage 20, which is arranged at right angles to the longitudinal axis of sym metry of the nose portion. From the port 18 a passage 21 leads inward to the center of the nose portion and connects with the passage 20. At the connection there is arranged a controllable flap means 22. In a corresponding manner a passage 23 leads to a connection location in the passage 20, with a controllable flap means 24 arranged in the con nection location. As can be understood from the figure, the flap means 22, 23 can be selectably set so that con nection is obtained between the ports 16, 17 neutral posi tion , 18, 17 left hand turning or 16, 19 right hand turning . Through this positioning of the device there is brought about such asymmetry in the discharge of air vor tices from the nose portion that controlling yaw moments to the left or right are obtained. In Figs. 9 and 10 is shown a further embodiment of a device according to the invention for stepwise controllable variation of the positions of the ports. In one side of the nose portion are arranged three ports 25, 27, 29, and in the other side three ports 26, 28, 30. The ports are connected in pairs by straight passages 31, 32 and 33, so that the ports 25, 26 are connected by the passage 31, the ports 27, 28 by the passage 32, and ports 29, 30 by the passage 33. In the passages are arranged controllable shut off flaps, of which only the shut off flap 34 in the passage 33 is shown. By controlling the shut off flaps there is obtained the desired asymmetry in the discharge of air vortices through which the desired controlling yaw moment is obtained.
