# Crystalline 1 butene polymer composition.

## Abstract
A crystalline 1 butene polymer composition which can be formed into piping or pipe linings comprises a a crystalline 1 butene polymer composed of 1 butene as the main component, and b from 0.2 to 100 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight of the crystalline 1 butene polymer a , of a radical treated crystalline olefin polymer 1 having a boiling p xylene insoluble content of at most 30 by weight and 2 satisfying the following expression T
