# PRECISION INTERNAL TUBE CUTTER

## Abstract
A precision tube cutter by which tubes can be severed without burrs, roughness, or distortion at the severed tube ends, and which is particularly adapted for use in the reconstitution of fuel assemblies of nuclear reactors. In a first embodiment, the tube cutter 40 includes a body 42 having a stem 50 threadedly secured within a bore 44 extending into the upper end of the body. The conical inner end 54 of the stem 50 is adapted for engagement with a pair of diametrically opposed slides 56 for actuating cutting wheels 58 thereon into engagement with the surrounding tube. The slides 56 and cutting wheels 58 are urged toward their inward retracted positions by return springs 62 . A second embodiment of the tube cutter 80 incorpo rates a slidable pin 82 within an eccentric lower bore 84 for actuating a single slide 56 and cutting wheel 58 . The slides are disposed in an area of the body which is smaller in diameter than the body end portions to avoid friction.
