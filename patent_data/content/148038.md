## Description
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION a Field of the Invention This invention is concerned with novel crystalline ironborosilicates and their uses in the production of high octane liquid hydrocarbons. More particularly, it relates to novel crystalline ironborosilicate zeolitic materials possessing catalytic properties and to conversion processes using such crystalline ironborosilicates. b Description of the Prior Art It has been demonstrated in the past that zeolitic materials, both natural and synthetic, and commonly referred to as molecular sieves, can have catalytic1 sorption and separating properties. A number of existing processes such as catalytic cracking, methanol conversion, isomerisation of xylenes, alkylation of aromatic, exemplify the uses of these molecular sieve materials0 Typically represented by aluminosilicates, zeolites are structurally complex crystalline inorganic polymers based on an infinitely extending framework ofA104 and SiO4 tetrahedra linked to each other by the sharing of oxygen atoms. This framework structure contains large and small cavities interconnected by channels as in the case of Y type zeolites. These cavities and channels which are generally uniform in size are occupied by cations and water molecules.The cations may be mobile and therefore can undergo ion exchange. In view of the mobility of the cations, it is believed that zeolitic materials behave like solid electrolytes, The water molecules may be removed reversibly by the application of heat, which in most cases leaves intact a highly porous crystalline structure As the ratio of silica to alumina increases, the zeolitic material becomes progressively hydrophobic. Zedlites structurally related to ZSM 5 do not possess cavities they have channel intersections and they are generally hydrophobic. In terms of composition, zeolites can be regarded as being derived frQn silica The substitution of some of the silicon atoms within the crystalline framework of the silica by trivalent aluminium, boron or iron atoms generates an anionic site in the environments of the aluminium atoms so that, in order to preserve electroneutrality, a cation such as that of the alkali or alkaline earth metals is required.Considering the fact that tetra coordinated aluminium atoms cannot share the same oxygen atom, it follows that y in the following empirical formula representing a typical zeolite cannot be less than 2 My 20 A1203 y SiO2 . wH2O wherein M is a cation of valence n, y is 2 or.greater and w is a value representing the water contained in the intracrystalline channel systems df the zeolite after synthesis or crystallization in nature, Prior art developments have resulted in the synthesis of more than 150 zeolite types. To date, forty zeolite minerals are known0 Zeolites which belong to the Pentasil family are considered relevant to the present invention.More specifically, this invention relates to crystalline ironborosilicate zeolites which are structurally related to ZSM 5 zeolites. U.S. Patent No. 3,702,886 which is here considered relevant discloses the crystalline aluminosilicate ZSM 5 and the process of preparing the same.This patent teaches the preparation of a crystalline alumino or gallosilicate and a crystalline alumino or gallogermanate by reacting silicon oxide or germanium oxide with aluminium oxide or gallium oxide in a range of specific ratios under specified reaction conditions.The product obtained has a specific X Ray diffraction pattern. This patent is therefore limited to alumino andgallosilicate as well as alumino and gallogermanates.Patents disclosing the synthesis of ZSM ll and ZSM 12 are likewise limited in scope to crystalline alumino or gallosilicates or germanates which also provide specific X Ray diffraction patterns. The production of the ZSM materials makes use of a mixed base system wherein sodium alumina and a silicon containing material are allowed to react in the presence of sodium hydroxide and an organic base template such as a tetrapropylammonium hydroxide or bromide under specified reaction conditions to yield U.S Patent No. 3,328,119 which is considered relevant art1 claims and teaches the process of preparing a crystalline aluminoborosilicate wherein the boria forms an integral part of the crystal framework struc ture of the zeolite material. However, the crystalline structure of the material is not related to the Pentasil family. Another U.S. Patent No. 4,269,813 which its considered more relevant to this invention discloses a class of crystalline borosilicates designated asAMS 1B and a process of preparing same. AMS 1B crystalline borosilicates are zeolitic materials which provide an X Ray diffraction pattern similar to ZSM 5. This patent is limited in scope to borosilicates German Offonlegungsschrift No. 2,830,787 relates to crystalline alumino, boro, arseno, and antimony silicates having specified X Ray diffraction patterns and to processes for preparing the same. German Offenlegungsschrift No. 2,755,770 discloses the preparation of crystalline iron aluminosilicates and their uses. Additional relevant prior art comprises U,S.Patents Nos. 4,029,716 and 4,078,009 which relate to a crystalline aluminosilicate zeolite having a silica to alumina ratio of at least 12 and a constraint index within the range of 1 to 12 and containing boron in an amount of at least 0.2 weight percent as a result of a reaction of the zeolite with a boron containing compound. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention, however, relates,t,o a novel family of stable synthetic crystalline ironborosilicates identified as ZKQ lB and possessing a specified X Ray diffraction pattern. It is understood that the iron and boron constitute an inherent part of the crystal framework structure of the material rather than a subsequent modification of the material composition. The ZSQ 1B crystalline ironborosilicates according to the invention are formed by reacting the products formed as a result of a reaction between an iron containing material and a boron containing material, such as boric acid, or an alkali tetrahydroborate with a silicon containing material in a basic medium, which contains an alkali hydroxyde or an alkaline earth hydroxide, an alkylammonium cation or a precursor thereof. optionally a mineralising agent such as sodium chloride and water. Under specified reaction conditions conducive to the formation of p Q 1B, the zeolite product is crystallised out from the solution with the iron and boron already contained within the crystal framework prior to physical separation of the product from the mother liquor. It will be understood that any modification of the crystallised ironborosilicate zeolite subsequent to its formation using such techniques as metal impregnation or deposition, cation exchange, is to be clearly distinguished from the process of the present invention. Broadly speaking, according to the present invention, there is provided a crystalline ironborosilicate product, which comprises a molecular sieve material having the following composition in terms of mole ratios of oxides 1.0 0.3 MnX2O a Fe203 b B203 y SiO2 . z H20 1 wherein M is selected from the group comprising hydrogen cation, ammonium cation, monovalent and divalent metal cations such as alkali metal cations alkaline earth metal cations, a catalytically active metal cation and mixtures thereof n is its valence a and b are each greater than zero but less than 1 such that a b 1 y is a value of at least 6 z is between zero and about 500.DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention such crystalline ironborosilicate provides an X Ray diffraction pattern which comprises the following diffraction lines as shown in Table I.

Minor shifts in interplanar spacings and minor variations in relative intensities may occur as a result of ion exchange of sodium ions or other alkaline metal ions with other cations and of heat treatment on the whole, however, the diffraction pattern will substantially be the same. In another instance, the claimed crystalline ironborosilicate which is not yet activated or calcined at high temperatures can be generally represented in terms of the mole ratios of oxides by equation 2 1.0 0.3 x R20 1 x My 20 a Fe2O zb Foe203 3 y SiO2 , z N 2 wherein R is an alkylammonium cation, M is at least one cation of valence n, a and b are each greater than 0 but less than 1 so that a b 1, y is at least 6 and z is a value between zero and 500, and x is greater than 0 but less than 1.

In the general formulations represented by the above equations, M can be substituted at least in part by other cations using such techniques well known in the art, for example1 ion exchange. These cations are preferably those which render the ZKQ lB crystalline ironborosilicate zeolites catalytically active especially in the conversion of hydrocarbons.

Examples of aSk li tetraZydroborates are sodium tetrahydroborate, potassium tetrahydroborate and lithium tetrahydroborate. Examples of alkylammonium cations are tetrapropylammonium bromide, tetrapropylammonium hydroxide, and precursors of said cations such as an alkylamine, an alkylamine plus an alkyl halide. For instance, by reacting tri n propylamine and n bromopropane under suit able conditions1 tetrapropylammonium bromide is formed.Hexamethylene diamine is an example of an alkylamine which may be used. The mixture used in the method of preparation of ZKQ 1B crystalline ironborosilicate can be further characterised in terms of mole ratios of oxides in the ranges presented in Table VI.

When an alkali metal hydroxide is used in the preparation to provide a source of alkali metal ions for electrovalent neutrality and to control the pH of the reaction mixture, the values of the ratio of OH SiO2 in Table VI should be such as to render the pH of the system broadly within the range of about 9 to about 13.5.An alkaline pH within that range favours the formation ofZKQ 1B crystalline ironborosilicate. The pH of the system falling within the range of about 9 to 12 is to be preferred as it favours the incorporation of iron and boron in the framework structure of the molecular sieve. Each ingredient is added in an amount calculated to give the desired molar composition in the resulting mixture. For example1 by regulating the amount of boron represented by B203 and iron represented by Fe203 in the reaction mixture, the SiO2 B2 0 and SiO2 Fe203 molar ratios in the final product can be varied within the ranges shown in Table VI.In view of the fact that.commercially available materials utilised in the preparation of the ironborosilicate. do contain very minor amounts of aluminium as an impurity, the Sio2 Al203 ratio in the synthesised ironborosilicates can be anywhere from 1500 and up. Reaction conditions conducive to the formation of crystalline ironborosilicates include heating the reaction mixture from about 25 0C to 3000C for a period running from less than 24 hours to 4 weeks under autogeneous pressure. Especially preferred reaction conditions include a temperature around l650C and a crystallisation time, of about a week. It is generally considered that the formation of zeolites requires low temperature hydrothermal conditions with concurrent low autogeneous pressure at saturated water vapour pressure and a high degree of supersaturation of the gel components, thereby leading to the nucleation of a large number of crystals. Generally the presence of a relatively high amount of sodium chloride promotes the mineralisation of zeolites. Calcination of crystalline ironborosilicate previously washed free of soluble salts is carried out in air at temperatures anywhere from 2600C to 590 C. Although said crystalline ironborosilicate is thermally highly stable, it is advisable not to calcine it at extreme temperatures because of the risk of modifying its structure or causing total collapse of its structure. Preferably, the calcination temperature required to remove the alkylammonium cation from the as synthesised crystalline ironborosilicate need not exceed 540 C. Generally, the hydrogen form of zKQ lB is prepared by repeated treatment with an aqueous solution of ammonium chloride at 100to under autogeneous pressure for a period anywhere from 1 hour to 24 hours. Ammonium nitrate and ammonium acetate can also be used in ammonium exchange. After being washed free of soluble salts with water, dried at 1100C, and then calcined at 5380C for a period anywhere from 3 hours to 15 hours, the ammonium form of ZKQ 1B crystalline ironborosilicate is converted into the hydrogen form which form is particularly favoured in the respective catalytic conversion of methanol and syngas into high octane liquid hydrocarbons. The crystalline ironborosilicate can be modified for certain applications in hydrocarbon conversions by impregnation or ion exchange techniques well known in the art. It may suitably be compounded with certain inorganic materials which include active and inactive materials for organic conversion processes. Examples of inorganic materials are clays, silica1 alumina1 silica alumina, silicazirconia, silica magnesia,etc. The matrix can be in the form of a hydrogel or cogel which subsequently provides a porous matrix material. The final composite may contain between 20 to 85 weight percent of crystalline ZRQ 1B Conversion of simple alcohols into high octane gasoline The conversion of methanol into high octane gasoline by contacting said alcohol with HZSM 5 catalyst is described in U.S.Patent No. 3,911,041.This process is considered relevant art. U.S. Patent No. 4,292,458 which is also considered relevant to the present invention discloses the use of a crystalline borosilicate zeolite in the conversion of methanol into synthetic high octane gasoline. It has been discovered that the acid form of crystalline ZKQ 1B ironborosilicate is active in the conversion of methanol and ethanol respectively into high octane gasoline. There is provided a process for the conversion of simple alcohols such as methanol or ethanol selectively into highly aromatic gasoline, which process involves contacting said feedstock or its products of dehydration with the hydrogen form of ZKQ lB crystalline ironborosilicate.Use of ZKQ 1B crystalline ironborosilicate zeolite in the conversion of syngas into high octane gasoline. The Fisher Tropsch synthesis which generally suffers from lack of selectivity produces a wide spectrum of hydrocarbons and oxygen containing products including low octane gasoline. Extensive and costly facilities are thus needed to separate and upgrade the products. Several approaches are being pursued in the development of highly selective catalysts for synthetic gas conversion. One of these approaches which seems to reflect current thinking regarding the mechanism of the reactions is based on the inter ception of intermediates formed during the Fisher Tropsch synthesis on iron catalyst. In this approach, primary lowmo1ecular weight intermediates derived from CO H2 synthesis reaction are intercepted before the normalFisher Tropsch polymerisation process occurs.This is effected in situ by introducing a second catalyst function which promotes the formation of higher molecular weight products by way of a different mechanism. This second function is provided by the active Bronsted or Lewis sites within the intracrystalline cavities, if any, and pores or channel system of zeolites. Zeolites possessing shapeselective properties are ideally suited for this purpose. U.S. Patent No. 4,172,843 which is considered relevant to the present invention discloses the use of an intimate mixture of an iron containing Fisher Tropsch component and a volume excess of an acidic aluminosilicate crystalline zeolite in the direct conversion of syngas to high octane predominantly olefinic naphtha. In U.S. Patent No. 4,086,262 there is provided a single stage process for the conversion of synthesis gas into gasoline wherein the catalyst is an intimate mixture of an iron containing F T catalyst and a ZSM 5 type catalyst. This patent is considered relevant art. In Europeant Patent Application No. 8030773.0, there is disclosed a process for converting syngas into either gasoline or higher boiling distillate material wherein the catalyst in the first stage reactor is an ironcontaining F T catalyst and, in the second stage reactor there is a crystalline aluminosilicate zeolite. U.S. Patent No. 4,046,830 discloses a method for upgrading Fisher Tropsch synthesis products over a ZSM 5 type zeolite. European Patent Application No. 79302666.7 discloses a method for preparing a synthesis gas conversion composite catalyst consisting of iron or iron oxide, a hydrogel matrix and an acidic crystalline aluminosilicate zeolite1 preferably a ZSM 5 type zeolite. From the foregoing, it will be appreciated that, for the production of high octane gasoline or olefinic naphtha directly from syngas, the conversion catalytic system employed has been based on the use of iron catalysts physically admixed with a relatively large proportion of crystalline zeolite such as ZSM 5. In this type of configuration the crystalline zeolite intercepts and scavenges the olefin intermediate products and effects synthesis of high octane aromatic gasoline or olefinic naphtha. Contrary to the above mentioned catalytic system, the syngas conversion catalyst of the present invention is a single particle catalyst wherein the iron component is not only not physically admixed with the zeolite component but it forms part and parcel of the crystalline structure of the zeolite, said zeolite material being an ironborosilicate crystalline zeolite in the acidic form. The present invention, then, concerns the use of an ironborosilicate crystalline zeolite as a syngas conversion catalyst for the production of high octane liquid hydrocarbons. In the formulation of such a syngas conversion catalyst, no iron either in metallic or oxide form is borosilicate zeolite. The said crystalline ironborosilicate zeolite may be composited with siliceous materials such as silica, alumina, silica alumina, silica zirconia, etc. Prior to its use for the conversion of syngas, the crystalline ironborosilicate zeolite previously exchanged with ammonium ions, washed free of soluble salts, and calcined at 5380C, is treated with syngas at temperatures of about 290 0C to 3400C for periods of time ranging from 3 hours to about 24 hours. The conversion of syngas to high octane gasoline using the pretreated catalyst is conveniently carried out at a temperature of 2500C to 3150C and a pressure of 446 kPa to 6996.1 kPa. The product gasoline has a boiling range of less than 2040C at a 90 overhead. The conversion syngas catalyst produces a highly olefinic, branched and aromatic product spectrum mostly concentrated in the region below C The process of this invention is preferably carried out at temperatures ranging from 2750C to about 3050c at gas hourly space velocities ranging from 400 to 6000, based on fresh feed and total catalyst volume at hydrogen to carbon oxide ratios from 0.5 1 to 2 1 and more desirably about 1 1 and pressures ranging from 446 kPa to 6996.1 kPa and more preferably from 1135.6 kPa to 2859.2 kPa The present invention will be further understood by the following examples, which are given for illustrative purposes only and are thus not intended to limit the scope of the invention.

Trademark EXAMPLE 7 A portion of each of the products obtained fromExamples 1 to 5 was copiously washed with deionised water to remove soluble salts. Washing was considered sufficient when the filtrate gave negative results with the silver nitrate and barium chloride tests. The sample was then calcined in air at 3750C for 15 hours in order to remove the tetrapropylammonium ion and to render more labile the sodium ions within the sample. The calcined sample was then exchanged with an aqueous solution of 5M ammonium chloride at 1000C for 15 hours, using 15 ml of the solution for each gram of sample treated. A second exchange was performed using fresh solution of ammonium chloride for 5 hours. The ammonium exchanged sample was then filtered and repeatedly washed with deionised water to ensure complete removal of soluble salts.Conversion to the hydrogen form was effected by final calcination of the sample at 5380C for 10 hours, using a programmed heating ramp rate of 3 0C per minute.

The conversion reactor was loaded with 12 g of HZKQ 1B1 crystalline ironborosilicate zeolite catalyst.Prior to start up, the inlet and outlet temperatures of the dehydration reactor and the conversion reactor were lined out at 3150C and 3710C and at 3710C and 4000C, respectively.Methanol was then pumped at a weight hourly space velocity of 1 and vapourised by means of a pre heater. The methanol vapour was partially dehydrated over the gamma alumina to yield a equilibrium mixture of methanol and dimethyl ether, which mixture was converted into high octane gasoline and water. The pressure of the process was maintained at 892 kPa. Small quantity of non condensable light C C hydrocarbons was produced. Analysis of the liquid organic product showed that it was similar to all intents and purposes to premium gasoline. The results are shown in TableVII.

EXAMPLE 9 High octane gasoline from synthesis gas A fixed bed catalyst operation was employed. 2 g of HZKO 1B3 mixed with ground quartz, in ratio 1 1 were placed in the tubular reactor. Prior to syngas gas conversion, the catalyst was pretreated with syngas having an H2scoratio of 1 at 3250C and 101 kPa and at a flowrate of 100 ml per minute for 15 hours. The one stage syngas conversion was conducted in a downflow manner at 1447 kPa using a synthesis gas with anH2 CO ratio of 1. The operating temperature was 3000C and the space velocity was 450. The weight carbon converted to hydrocarbons was 60.9 and methane in hydrocarbon product was 11.2 weight percent. Chromatographic analysis of the C5 product showed it to be highly olefinic and aromatic in nature.
