# A process for the preparation of a precipitate of casein and whey protein.

## Abstract
A process for the preparation of a precipitate of casein and whey protein from a milk product containing casein and whey protein which comprises adjusting the pH of the milk product to a value above 6.8, subjecting the resulting product to a heat treatment whereby the whey protein dena tures, cooling the heated product to a temperature below 65 C, reducing the pH of the cooled solution to a value below 5.4 and isolating the resulting precipitate.
