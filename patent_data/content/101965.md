# Production of sulfur trioxide, sulfuric acid and oleum.

## Abstract
A feed gas mixture with SO₂ partial pressure of at least about 0.5 atmosphere and an O₂ SO₂ mole ratio of between about 0.7 1 and about 1 1 is passed in plug flow through a packed bed of conversion catalyst. The catalyst bed is cooled to produce a temperature profile including a first zone of increasing temperature, a second zone of substantially constant temperature and a third zone of declining tempera ture. The exit temperature is sufficiently low for high equilibrium conversion values. The effluent is cooled to condense liquid sulfur trioxide, while the sulfur trioxide remaining in the gas stream can be absorbed into oleum and or sulfuric acid. Enriched oleum can be prepared by blending condensed sulfur trioxide into oleum or sulfuric acid.
