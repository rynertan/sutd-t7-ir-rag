# Pipe clamp.

## Abstract
A pipe clamp 10 has a U bolt 11 with legs 13 each of which is provided with first and second tandemly arranged frustoconical circumferential ribs 14, 15 with planar annular bases 16, 17 that define the distal margins of circumferential grooves 18, 19 in the U bolt legs, and a C shaped sheet metal saddle 12 having a hollow body portion 20 with inside edges 21 that are separated by a space less than the max imum width of the body portion. The saddle 12 has circum ferentially slit extremities 22, 23 each of which has aligned transverse internal flanges 24 with opposed inner margins 25 that define split circular openings which are dimensioned to permit the flanges 24 to snap around the circumferential ribs 14, 15 and engage in the grooves 18, 19 . The U bolt 11 and saddle 12 are adapted to loosely encircle a pipe when the flanges 24 are engaged in the first grooves 18 , and are adapted to firmly clamp the pipe when the flanges 24 are engaged in the second grooves 19 .
