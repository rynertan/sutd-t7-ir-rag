# A chain link.

## Abstract
In a welded metal chain each link 10 is of uniform, sub stantially trapezoidal cross section throughout its length, the cross section tapering outwardly from an inside bearing sur face 13 to an outside surface 14 of the link 10 . In this way the distribution of metal is matched to the distribution of stres ses in the link 10 , under load, thereby improving the strength to weight ratio of the chain.

## Description
A CHAIN LINK This invention relates to a chain link, particularly a welded metal chain link and to a welded metal chain construction. In a welded metal chain each link is made from a metal bar which is forged to form two facing U portions and then welded, the link being interlinked with a preceding link of the chain. Conventionally each link is of circular cross section throughout its length. In the case of a chain under load, however, each link is subjected to compressive and tensile stresses which are unequally distributed throughout the link, setting up bending stresses which are a maximum at the arcuate end portions of the link where the compressive stresses on the inner side of the neutral axis are greatest and the tensile stresses on the outer side of the neutral axis are least.Thus, if the cross sectional distribution of metal of the link is symmetrical about the neutral axis, as is the case with a link formed from round section stock, a considerable amount of metal remains but lightly loaded when the chain is subjected to maximum load. Therefore, the strength to weight ratio of a chain link formed from round section stock is less than optimal. It has previously been proposed to make elded metal chains for special purposes using stock of non circular cross section, examples of such chains being described in U.S. Patent No. 878,989 to Henry B. Newhall, dated February 11, 1908, U.S. Patent No. 2,103,972 to Leonard T. Harris, dated December 28, 1937, and U.S. Patent No. 4,110,971 to Peter Bruce, dated September 5, 1978. In these constructions, however, there is no attempt to improve the strength to weight ratio of a link by matching the cross sectional distribution of metal to the stress distribution. U.S. PatentNo. 3,453,823 to Peter Mundt, dated July 8, 1969 and U.S. Patent No.3,662,539 to Peter Florjancic, dated May 16, 1972 also disclose chain links of non circular cross section, but are specifically concerned with the manufacture of plastics chain links formed by injection moulding and are not applicable to the manufacture of welded metal chains in which strength to weight ratio is a major consideration. The present invention is specifically concerned with the problem of constructing a welded metal chain so as to reduce the amount of metal required for a given strength. The invention is based on the concept of designing each link so as to match the distribution of metal more nearly to the distribution of stresses under load. A welded metal chain according to one aspect of the invention comprises a plurality of interconnected links, and is characterised in that each link consisting of a closed member of uniform cross section throughout its length, said cross section tapering outwardly from an inside bearing surface to a radiused outer surface of the link. According to another aspect of the invention there is provided a welded metal chain comprising a plurality of interconnected similar links, each link consisting of a closed member forming an elongated loop and being of uniform trapezoidal cross section throughout its length, the member providing an outside surface and an arcuate inside surface and tapering in thickness outwardly from said inside surface to said outside surface. An embodiment of the invention will now be described, by way of an example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a side elevation showing part of a welded steel chain in accordance with the invention, and Figure 2 is a part sectional perspective view, somewhat enlarged of one of the links. Referring to the drawings, the chain comprises a plurality of interconnected similar links 10. Each link 10 consists of a steel bar which is of uniform cross section throughout its length and formed into a closed loop, the link being welded in the conventional manner. As shown, each link 10 has a pair of straight leg portions 11 and a pair of arcuate end portions 12, the inside surfaces 13 of the end portions 12 constituting arcuate bearing surfaces, the curvature of the bearing surfaces corresponding to the curvature of the end portions 12 in the direction orthogonal thereto. The chain link 10 of the present invention is characterised by the fact that it is of trapezoidal cross section, the cross section being defined by the arcuate inside bearing surface 13, an arcuate outside surface 14 of greater curvature i.e. smaller radius of curvature than the inside bearing surface 13, and a pair of side surfaces 15 which taper linearly from the inside bearing surface 13 to the radiused outer surface 14. With this construction the distribution of metal in the link 10 is more nearly matched to the stress distribution under load than in a conventional link, that is to say, the thickness,gf metal increases towards the inside bearing surface 13, so that the strength to weight ratio of the link 10 is improved. In the preferred embodiment shown each link 10 is symmetrical with respect to a medial plane intersecting the inside and outside surfaces 13 and 14, this plane being denoted by line X X in Figure 2. Since the inside portions of the link 10, that is the portions between the inside bearing surface 13 and the neutral axis, are in compression at the arcuate end portions 12 and in tension at the straight leg portions 11, it is evident that there are four regions of the loop at which the bending moments are zero when the chain is under load. These regions, denoted at a, b, c, and d in Figure 1, are determined by the configuration of the link at the end portions as well as by the cross sectional configuration and are suitable positions for making the welds. Thus, referring to Figure 1, the formed link 10 may be welded advantageously at any of the positions a, b, c and d.
