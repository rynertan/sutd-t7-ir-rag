# METHOD OF DETECTING RECOVERY FROM FAULT IN A DATA TRANSMISSION SYSTEM WHICH EFFECTS LOOPBACK CONTROL

## Abstract
A looped data transmission system comprises looped transmission lines 36, 37 of two systems having different transmission directions, and a plurality of stations 31...35 and at least one station 30 connected to said transmission lines 36, 37 of two systems. If fault occurs in the transmis sion lines 36, 37 of the two systems over the same section, a loopback configuration is established such that stations 31, 35 adjacent to the faulty section send the signals from one system back to the other system. With the loopback configuration being established, the stations 32...34 which have received supervisory signals sent from a loopback end station 31, 35 send them back to the transmission line of the other system. When one of the loopback end stations 31, 35 has received the supervisory signal, it is so judged that a portion of the faulty section is recovered, and the result of judgement is informed to the control station 30 .
