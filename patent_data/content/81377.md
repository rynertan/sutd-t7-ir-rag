# Control systems for power plant feedwater systems.

## Abstract
A system for controlling the feedwater system in a nuclear power plant utilises a logic calculations subsystem 50 which selects an operational mode of the system to be monitored from a plurality of operational modes. A disturbance estimate calculations subsystem 52 contains a dynamic mathematic model of the feedwater system and compares measured system variables with corresponding dynamic model variables contained therein to produce signals representative of deviations therebetween. A modified feedforward calculations subsystem 54 utilises these signals and other system parameters as inputs to a steady state mathematical model to produce control signals to determine valve positions and pump speeds so that the control valve flows, minimum control valve pressure drop, and feedwater pump flows are at their respective demanded values.
