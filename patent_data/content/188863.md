# Direct drive robotic system.

## Abstract
The disclosure relates to a direct drive robot which in cludes a pedestal 16 having two motors 12, 14 which rotate around a common axis J1 to directly drive rotation of first and of second linking arms 18, 20 which are rotating in a plane perpendicular to this pedestal. The first 18 , inner link is pref erably driven through a column directly driven by a first motor rotor, the column supporting the inner end of the link. The sec ond, outer line 20 is driven by the second coaxial direct drive motor 12 through a simple, highly tensioned belt and pulley arrangement 70, 72, 74, 80 . As a result of this direct drive ar rangement, movement is provided about two separate parallel axes by two arms arranged perpendicular to the first axis which amounts to two major driving motors of the robot. These two arms are linked together between this major pedestal and the end effector 22 of the robot, centralizing the driving mo tors at the main stabilizing pedestal, while providing rapid rota tional movement around each of the two axes. The first axis J1 is defined by the major pedestal and the second axis J2 is defined by the junction between the inner and outer linking arms 18, 20 which connect the pedestal 16 to the end effec tor. The final vertical positioning of the end effector 22 along a third axis J3 as well as rotational movement of the end ef fector around the same third axis is achieved by the use of
