# Method of and apparatus for measuring the power output of lasers.

## Abstract
There is provided a method and apparatus 10 for determining the power output of a laser for wavelengths which are substantially fully absorbed by water, such as the wavelengths produced by carbon dioxide lasers. A rotary member 12 defines a surface of revolution 14 which widens away from an opening 16 to a free edge 18 , with the opening being located substantially at the axis of the surface. Means are provided for rotating a member about its axis, and water is brought to the surface through the opening, to form a film running to the free edge. Means 48 are provided for collecting water at the free edge, and the water through put is measured by suitable means. Further means 70,71 are provided for measuring the water temper ature differential arising due to absorbable radiation falling upon the water as it runs over the surface, and on the basis of the throughput and the temperature differential, the absorbed power, and hence the output of the laser in the wavelength region in question, can be calculated. For COâ‚‚ lasers substantially all of the radiation is in the region which is fully absorbed by water, and thus the apparatus and method provided herein are ideal for measuring the power output of lasers of this kind.
