## Description
The present invention relates to a transistor circuit for a semiconductor device with hysteresis operation, comprising detector means for detecting a change in the level of an input signal Vin according to one of first and second threshold levels V1,V2 and generating an output signal Vout having a level corresponding to said input signal Vin , the level of said input signal Vin being changed between a first level H and a second level L which is different from said first level H , and said first and second threshold levels V1,V2 falling within a range defined between said first and second levels H,L and selector means coupled to said detector means for selecting one of said first and second threshold levels V1,V2 in accordance with the level of said output signal Vout and applying the selected one threshold level V1 or V2 to said detector means, said detector means including a first transistor having a source coupled to a power supply line, a gate responsive to said input signal Vin and a drain providing said output signal Vout and a second transistor having a drain coupled to the drain of said first transistor, a gate responsive to said input signal Vin and a source responsive to a given potential VB for determining which of said first and second threshold levels V1,V2 is applied to said detector means, and said selector means including a third transistor having a drain coupled to the source of said second transistor, a gate responsive to said input signal Vin and a source coupled to another power supply line GND and a fourth transistor having a drain coupled to a power supply line, a gate responsive to said output signal Vout and a source providing said given potential VB , said first, third and fourth transistors being enhancement MOS transistors. Such a circuit is known from JP A 58 108 820. Another Schmitt trigger circuit is known from US A 3 984 703. From Integrierte Digitalbausteine by K.Reiss, 3rd edition, 1974, Siemens AG, page 220, it is known that the hysteresis of a Schmitt trigger may be selected in order to improve noise immunity. With a current trend toward higher integration of semiconductor LSI circuits, a power consumption in an LSI chip is increasing. This results in inviting various noises in the LSI circuit and causes erroneous operation. Fig. 1 shows an address transition detector circuit for detecting the transition of an address signal. The reference symbol Ar denotes an address signal. The reference symbol CE denotes a chip enable signal set at L level in a standby mode in which the internal circuit operation is inhibited. The reference symbol CE denotes an inverted chip enable signal. The reference numeral 1 denotes a NOR gate consisting of MOS transistors 11 to 14. The reference numeral 2 denotes an inverter consisting of MOS transistors 15 and 16. The reference numeral 3 denotes a pulse generator internal circuit being formed with MOS transistors 20 to 49, which detects a change in the potential of an inputted voltage at node a2 and generates an output pulse at node Fig. 2 shows the waveform of respective signals appearing in the circuit of Fig. 1. At the time when the level of address signal Ar changes from L to H , node a1 is at H , node a2 is at L , node a3 is at H , node a4 is at L , and node a7 is at H . Since node a8 is pulled up by p channel transistor 20, the level of node a8 is H so that node a9 is at L and node a10 is at H . Then, a clocked gate 60 is closed and a clocked gate 61 is opened, thereby establishing a positive feedback loop between nodes a5 and a6 so as to stably hold the logical state. When address signal Ar goes to H , node a4 goes to H and n channel transistor 22 is turned on. Since node a7 is initially set at H and transistor 24 is turned on with the H of node a7, the circuit of transistors 22, 24 and 25 is activated and node a8 goes to L . Node a9 then goes to H , node a10 goes to L , and clocked gate 60 is opened. In this manner, the information of changed signal Ar is transmitted through the circuit path of Fig. 1, and node a7 goes to L so that transistor 24 is turned off. A discharge path of transistors 22, 24 and 25 is then cut off, and node a8 is pulled up to H again. Along with this, node a9 goes to L , node a10 goes to H , and clocked gate 60 is closed to complete the series of circuit operations. During this process, node When address signal Ar goes to L , node The circuit of Fig. 1 detects the transition of address signal Ar from L to H or vice versa and generates at node The circuit of Fig. 1 is generally employed in an address input section of a memory circuit, and it controls the operation of the memory circuit by pulse PX obtained at node As described above, according to the Fig. 1 configuration, a change or transition in the input signal Ar is transmitted to the internal circuit 3 so that the address transition detector circuit is activated. Assume that the potential of address signal Ar is substantially fixed at a prescribed constant level but it involves a slight potential change due to noises, etc. Such a slight potential change is not generally detected by input gate 1 and will not be transmitted to the internal circuit 3. However, if the level of signal Ar reaches a potential at which the gain or amplification factor of input gate 1 is high, said slight potential change in signal Ar is largely amplified by input gate 1, and the amplified potential change causes an erroneous detection. Namely, the pulse width, timing, etc. of pulses PX obtained by the erroneous detection are inaccurate, and the circuit cannot be operated in a normal manner. The above description is made with reference to a case wherein signal Ar is subjected to noises. However, a similar situation may also arise when noises on a power supply line fluctuate the power supply potential for input gate 1. This is because, since the potential of an input signal is defined with respect to a power supply potential, a fluctuation in the power supply potential equivalently induces noises in the input signal. Especially, in a semiconductor LSI, a power or current consumption within the LSI chip becomes large in proportion to an increase in integration density. From this, a fluctuation in the potential of a power supply line cannot be disregarded in such an LSI. It is likely that such a situation will continue. In this manner, a conventional circuit as shown in Fig. 1 is liable to an erroneous operation due to noises or the like and a countermeasure to this problem to guarantee a stable operation has been desired. It is accordingly a main object of the present invention to provide a transistor circuit for a semiconductor device with hysteresis operation, which is insensitive to noise. Still another object of the invention is to provide a Schmitt trigger circuit having a hysteresis characteristic, which is capable of reliably converting TTL levels into MOS levels. According to one aspect of the invention, the circuit initially defined is characterized in that said second transistor is an intrinsic MOS transistor whose gate threshold voltage is substantially zero. According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of manufacturing the circuit of said one aspect comprising the steps of This invention can be more fully understood from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which Hereinafter, preferred embodiments of the invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the following description, the same or similar elements are denoted by the same or similar reference numerals throughout the drawings, thereby avoiding redundant explanations. Fig. 3 is a circuit diagram of an inverter with hysteresis operation, which is an embodiment of the present invention. The inverter of Fig. 3 includes a level change detector circuit 71,72 and a threshold selector 73,74 . The level change detector circuit is formed with a p channel MOS transistor 71 and an n channel MOS transistor 72. The source of transistor 71 is connected to a positive power supply terminal 50. The gate of transistor 71 receives an input signal Vin, and the drain thereof provides an output signal Vout which is anti phasic to input signal Vin. The drain and gate of transistor 72 are connected to the drain and gate of transistor 71, respectively. The threshold selector circuit is formed with n channel MOS transistors 73 and 74. The drain of transistors 73 is connected to the source of transistor 72, and the gate of transistor 73 receives input signal Vin. The source of transistor 73 is connected to a circuit ground. The drain of transistor 74 is connected to power supply terminal 50, or it may be connected to any other proper positive potential line. The gate of transistor 74 receives output signal Vout, and the source thereof is connected to the drain of transistor 73. The threshold selector circuit is formed with n channel MOS transistors 73 and 74. The drain of transistor 73 is connected to the source of transistor 72, and the gate of transistor 73 receives input signal Vin. The source of transistor 73 receives input signal Vin. The source of transistor 73 is connected to a circuit ground. The drain of transistor 74 is connected to power supply terminal 50, or it may be connected to any other proper positive potential line. The gate of transistor 74 receives output signal Vout, and the source thereof is connected to the drain of transistor 73. Transistors 71,73 and 74 are enhancement type, while transistor 72 is an I type intrinsic type . The property of I type transistor 72 serves to decrease both threshold levels V1 and V2, while retaining the hysteresis characteristic as shown in Fig. 4. Practically, threshold levels V1,V2 of the Fig. 3 inverter can be set at around 1.0 to 1.5 volts. Thus, a Schmitt trigger circuit with decreased threshold levels, which has a hysteresis characteristic and is capable of reliably converting TTL levels into MOS levels, is obtained by the configuration of Fig. 3. During the manufacture of NMOS n channel MOS transistors, an impurity of the same type as that of a substrate is doped in a channel region in order to obtain a prescribed threshold voltage. A low threshold voltage NMOS transistor can be obtained if such impurity doping is not effected. If a mask which selectively disturbs the impurity doping into transistor 72 is used during the impurity doping process, only the threshold voltage of transistor 72 can be made low without requiring a supplemental or additional manufacturing process. The threshold voltage of the Schmitt trigger circuit in Fig. 3 can be set low by the use of I type transistor 72 having low threshold voltage. The circuit of Fig. 3 may be manufactured by a conventional semiconductor IC manufacturing process. The above inverter is a sort of a Schmitt trigger circuit and has a hysteresis characteristic as shown in Fig. 4. The level change detector 71,72 detects the level change in input signal Vin according to a first or second threshold level V1 or V2 and generates output signal Vout corresponding to input signal Vin. The difference V2 V2, or VTH between the first and second threshold levels is so selected that the level change detector does not respond to variations in the potential of input signal Vin due to noises, etc. The level of input signal Vin changes between a first level H and a second level L which is different from level H . First and second threshold levels V1,V2 fall within a range defined between first and second levels H , L . First threshold level V1 is used for detecting a signal transition that the level of input signal Vin changes from first level H to second level L . Second threshold level V2 is used for detecting a signal transition that the level of input signal Vin changes from second level L to first level H . The threshold selector 73,74 selects one of the first and second threshold levels V1,V2. The threshold selector 73,74 applies the second threshold level V2 to the level change detector 71,72 when the level of output signal Vout represents the first level H . When the level of output signal Vout represents the second level L , the threshold selector 73, 74 applies the first threshold level V1 to the level chagne detector 71, 72 . The circuit of Fig. 3 will operate as follows. Assume that, at an initial stage, the level of input signal Vin is H and the level of output signal Vout is L 71 OFF 72, 73 ON . In this case, transistor 74 is in OFF state because Vout is L . When the potential of Vin passes across a first threshold level V1 during the level change of Vin from H to L , the potential of Vout abruptly rises at Vin V1, as shown in Fig. 4. Threshold level V1 is determined by the power supply potential at terminal 50 and the threshold voltage of transistor 71. The inverter characteristic of the above abrupt potential rise at threshold level V1 depends on the ratio among conductances of transistors 71 to 73. After completion of the above level change of signal Vin from H to L , transistor 71 is ON and transistor 72 is OFF. In this case, signal Vout is H so that transistor 74 is ON. Then, a potential VB at the source of transistor 72 is enhanced via the turned on transistor 74 by the H level of Vout. At this time, the threshold voltage of transistor 72 is enhanced according to a back gate bias effect or substrate bias effect with the H level of VB, so that the input threshold level of the Fig. 3 inverter is increased to V2. From this, even if the potential of signal Vin exceeds the threshold level V1 due to noises, unless the peak potential of such signal Vin exceeds the increased threshold level V2, the output condition of Vout H is stably retained. Thus, the Fig. 3 inverter is insensitive to noises on input signal Vin. Incidentally, according to the presently available CMOS technology, the back gate bias effect obtained in an NMOS transistor is more prominent than that obtained in a PMOS transistor. This is the reason why n channel transistors 72 to 74 are used in the Fig. 3 embodiment. With an increase in the potential of signal Vin, the drain curren of transistor 73 gradually increases so that potential VB at the source of transistor 72 gradually decreases. The decrease in potential VB renders the threshold voltage of transistor 72 equivalently low. When the potential difference between the gate and source of transistor 72 exceeds the threshold voltage of transistor 72, transistor 72 is turned on so that the potential of signal Vout falls. The potential fall of Vout lowers the transconductance of transistor 74, resulting in reducing the potential VB. The reduce in potential VB causes a potential reduction of Vout. Thus, a positive feedback PFB operation is effected through transistor 74. With this PFB operation, the potential of Vout decreases rapidly. The potential of input signal Vin which triggers the above PFB operation is represented by V2 in Fig. 4. The threshold level V2 is higher than said threshold level V1 by ŒîVTH. As seen from Fig. 4, the potential of output signal Vout changes in a different manner in accordance with the rising and falling of input signal Vin. Thus, the inverter of Fig. 3 has a hysteresis characteristic. The signal response of the Fig. 3 inverter has a dead zone ŒîVTH with respect to the amplitude of input signal Vin. Because of the presence of such a dead zone, the Fig. 3 circuit is insensitive to noise components contained in signal Vin having amplitudes less than ŒîVTH. When the Fig. 3 circuit is applied to the input gate 1 Fig. 5 or the subsequent input stage 2 Fig. 6 of an internal circuit 3, the internal circuit 3 will not be adversely affected by noises on signal Vin. Fig. 5 shows a circuit configuration of an address transition detector according to the present invention. This circuit employs a hysteresis inverter of Fig. 3 at input gate 1. To avoid current consumption in a standby mode, input gate 1 is responsive to the logical NOR of signals Fig. 6 shows another circuit configuration of an address transition detector according to the present invention. In the Fig. 6 circuit, an inverter 2 following to an input gate 1 has a circuit configuration of Fig. 3. In a MOS input circuit, conversion from TTL Transistor Transistor Logic levels into MOS levels is generally required. According to the Fig. 6 circuit, such conversion is achieved at input gate 1, while noise free operation is achieved at inverter 2 with a hysteresis characteristic as shown in Fig. 4. According to such a circuit configuration, the circuit design with respect to the TTL MOS level conversion can be independent of the circuit design with respect to the hysteresis characteristic for eliminating the influence of noises. An examination was made to determine whether or not an address transition detector erroneously operates when address signal Ar is subjected to periodic noises having an amplitude ŒîV and a period ŒîT as shown in Fig. 7. Generally speaking, such a detector is liable to be erroneously operated if the noise period ŒîT becomes long and or the noise amplitude ŒîV becomes large. From this, an erroneous operating region of the detector can be represented as a function of ŒîT band ŒîV. The result of the examination obtained by calculation is shown in Fig. 8. In Fig. 8, the boundary line Fig. 8 teaches that a normally operating region outer region of boundary Fig. 9 shows another modification of the Fig. 3 inverter circuit. In the Fig. 9 inverter, the source of a p channel MOS transistor 71 is connected to the drain of a p channel MOS transistor 71B. The gate of transistor 71B receives an inverted chip enable signal According to the above embodiment of Fig. 3 the circuit threshold levels V1,V2 are not restricted to the threshold voltage of transistors in the circuit. Rather, the circuit threshold levels V1,V2 can be set optionally. Since the Fig. 3 circuit has a hysteresis characteristic which serves to eliminate the influence of noises, a noise free transistor circuit having a function for converting TTL levels into MOS can be obtained. Transistor 72 in the Schmitt trigger circuit of Fig. 3 has a lower threshold voltage than the threshold voltage of other transistors in a memory, microprocessor, etc. With the threshold voltage of transistor 72 set at around 0V, even if a back gate bias is effected, the upper limit of the threshold voltage of transistor 72 is up to about 1V. From this, the input threshold levels V1,V2 of the Fig. 3 Schmitt trigger circuit can be set at about 1.5 V. A method for manufacturing an integrated circuit including Figs. 10A to 10D are sectional views explaining a method for manufacturing the transistors 72 and 73 in Fig. 3 Next, as shown in Fig. 10B, shallow implantation is effected on a given surface region A of substrate 110, which is provided for an enhancement type NMOS transistor 73. That is, a region 8 for a low threshold voltage NMOS transistor 72 is covered with a resist 140. Subsequently, a p type impurity such as boron is ion implanted into region B with a relatively low acceleration voltage of, e. g., 40 keV and with a low dose of 2.0 x 10¬π¬π cm¬≤. Then, the threshold voltage of NMOS transistor 72 at region B is set at about 0.8 V. After completion of this ion implantation, resist 140 is removed. After resist 140 is removed, as shown in Fig. 10C, polycrystalline silicon layers 150A, 150B are formed at prescribed positions on gate oxide film 130. These polycrystalline silicon layers are respectively patterned to form gate electrodes 150A and 150B of transistor 73 and 72. Thereafter, as shown in Fig. 10D, an n type impurity such as arsenic is ion implanted into the surface region of p type substrate 110. At this time, each of gate electrodes 150A and 150B serves as a mask during the manufacturing process of diffusion layers 160A, 160B and 160C. Layer 160A serves as the source of transistor 73. Layer 160B serves as the drain of transistor 73 and as the source of transistor 72 or 72A . Layer 160C serves as the drain of transistor 72 or 72A . Then, the manufacturing process of transistors 72 and 73 in Fig. 3 is completed. According to the above mentioned IC manufacturing process, a totempole configuration of an enhancement type MOS transistor 73 with a relatively high threshold voltage and an intrinsic type MOS transistor 72 with a low threshold voltage of about 0 V, is obtained. Fig. 11 shows an impurity profile distribution A of the channel region of relatively high threshold NMOS transistor 73 and an impurity profile B of the channel region of low threshold NMOS transistor 72 obtained by the manufacturing process of Figs. 10A to 10D. As seen from the profile B in Fig. 11, the impurity concentration near the channel surface of the low threshold transistor 72 , on which no shallow implantation is effected, is almost zero. From this, channel inversion in the low threshold transistor 72 is readily performed, thereby obtaining a zero threshold voltage. The impurity concentration at a deep portion in the channel of the low threshold transistor 72 is the same as that of the high threshold transistor 73. For this reason, the leakage characteristic of the low threshold transistor 72 According to the above mentioned manufacturing process, except for the step of forming a resist film 140 on the region B for a prospective low threshold NMOS transistor 72 , the transistor circuit of the invention Figs. 3, etc. can be simultaneously formed, together with a memory and or microprocessor part, by means of a conventional IC manufacturing technology. In addition, the resist film may be simply formed to cover the low threshold transistor region. Therefore, this resist film forming step does not require a high precision and is easy to perform. In the above method, deep implantation into the MOS transistor region is performed first, and shallow implantation is performed next. However, this method may be modified as follows. Thus, shallow implantation into a high threshold transistor region is performed through a gate oxide film while the low threshold transistor region is covered with a resist film. Thereafter, the resist film is removed, and deep implantation into both the transistor regions is performed. In this manner, according to the method of the present invention, a low threshold voltage transistor such as an intrinsic MOS transistor can be formed simultaneously with a relatively high threshold voltage enhancement MOS transistor, without requiring a complex procedure or a substantial modification of the manufacturing process. With this method, a Schmitt trigger circuit capable of effectively converting TTL level signals into MOS level signals can be manufactured by a conventional IC manufacturing technology. The present invention thus contributes to an improvement in performance of a large scale integrated circuit such as a memory or a microprocessor.
