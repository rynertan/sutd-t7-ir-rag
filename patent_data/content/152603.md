# Assay for ligands.

## Abstract
This invention concerns an assay for analyte in a sam ple wherein there is produced in the sample a mixture containing a complex of trace bound to a member selected from the group consisting of a soluble binder for the analyte and anylte, and free trace, the improvement comprising Contacting sample containing the mixture of bound and free tracer with a first supported binder separating sample from the first supported binder contacting separated sam ple with a second supported binder separating sample from the second supported binder, one of the first and second supported binder being a binder for the free tracer and the other of the first and second supported binder being a binder for the complex to thereby separate both bound and free tracer from the sample and determining at least one of the separated bound tracer and separated free tracer as a measure of analyte.
