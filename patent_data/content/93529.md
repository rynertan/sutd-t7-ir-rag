# CHLORINE PRODUCING CONSUMING PLANT COMPRISING A ZINC CHLORIDE BATTERY

## Abstract
An improved chlorine producing plant having at least one electrolytic cell adapted to generate chlorine in combina tion with a zinc chloride battery stack and electrolyte circula tion system is disclosed. Conduit means is provided for permitting the chlorine generated by the battery stack during the charging of the battery stack to supplement the amount of chlorine generated by the electrolytic cell, and for permitting the electrolytic cell to supply chlorine to the battery stack during the discharge of the battery stack. Additionally, power conditioning means may be interposed between the electrolytic cell and the zinc chloride battery stack for permitting tne zinc chloride battery stack to supple ment the supply of electrical power to the electrolytic cell during the discharging of the battery stack. In operation, the zinc chloride battery stack is charged substantially during off peak electrical energy consuming hours and discharged substantially during on peak electrical energy consuming hours. The principles of the present invention are also applicable to chlorine consuming plants having a means for conveying chlorine from a source of chlorine, such as a tank car containing liquidified chlorine. A zinc chloride battery stack is provided in combination with conduit means for permitting the chlorine generated by the battery stack during the charging of the battery stack to supplement the amount of chlorine to the chlorine consuming plant, and for permit ting the conveying means to supply chlorine to the battery stack during the discharging of the battery stack.
