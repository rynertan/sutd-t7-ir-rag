# Assembled tube.

## Abstract
Cylindrical or prismatic assembled tube consisting of two or more half cylinder, right angle or flat elements which are shipped and stored in stacks and then prepared for use by inserting one into another in correspondence with the mouldings along the generatrices.

## Claims
Claims 1. Assembled tube made up of two or more elements which can be shipped and stored in stacks and then assembled in place by inserting one in another, using a spring loaded bend and moulding of the generatrices to effect the necessary seal between the component elements. 2. Assembled tube as claimed in claim 1 wherein two cylindrical or angular half tubes 1 and 2 are combined by bending bonds 3 and 4 along the generatrices so that they assume a shape which allows one to be inserted in the other, with a profile with parallel or trapezoidal edges, or any other suitable shape. 3. Assembled tube as claimed in the preceding claims wherein bent loop 5 corresponding with the generatrices allows greater elasticity. 4. Assembled tube as claimed in claim 1 wherein flat elements 6 and 7 and right angle elements 8 and 9 allow prismatic tubes 10 to be formed in various sizes, as a function of the number of elements used. 5. Assembled tube as claimed in the preceding claims wherein mouldings on the ends 3 and 4 along the generatrices of all the elements allow the ends of the spirals of the tube edges to come in contact with the spiral opposite to ensure a natural, mild pressure when the pieces are assembled. 6. Assembled tube as claimed in the preceding claims wherein mouldings 3 and 4 are sprinkled with a thin layer of glue to completely lock the tube in position.

## Description
Assembled tubeCoi Sud di Grimaldi Carlo, Atripalda AV , Via Appia 59The invention involves an assembled tube which can be put together with two or more elements moulded along their generatrices so that the component elements may be inserted one into another. Tt is well known that certain devices, particularly suction devices, require very thin walled tubes with large diameters which are thus very bulky, especially for shipping and storageThe aim of this invention is the realization of a tube divided in two or more sections, so that they may be piled one on top of the other to allow shipping in very small spaces.However, the tube must be assembled for use after shipping in the most rapid, convenient and simple way possible, even by nonnspecialized workers.This aim is achieved with an assembled tube made up of two or more elements which can be shipped and stored in stacks and then assembled in place by inserting one in another, using a spring loaded bend and moulding of the generatrices to effect the necessary seal between the component elements. Some preferred, but exemplificative only, embodiments are shown in the attached drawings in figures 1 8, as follows fig. 1 shows an axonometric view of several overlapping half tubes, of minimum bulk fig. 2 shows an axonometric view of the detail relative to insertion of two shaped generatrices from two different half tubes fig. 3 shows a cross section of the moulding generatrices after insertion fig.. 4 shows an axonometric view of a prismatic rectangular tube after assembling fig. 5 shows a cross section of the groove area, with a different profile from that shown in fig. 3 fig. 6 shows two circular half tubes being inserted one into another fig. 7 shows flat and angular component elements for a prismatic variant with several elements fig. 8 shows an axonometric view of a prismatic tube assembled with the elements shown in fig. 7.Figure 1 shows two cylindrical or angular half tubes 1 and 2 being combined by bending ends 3 and 4 along the generatrices so that they assume a shape which allows one to be inserted in the other, with a profile with parallel edges as in fig. 3, trapezoidal edges as in fig. 5, or any other suitable shape.The profile shown in fig. 5 may have bent loop 5 cor responding with the generatrices to allow greater elasticity. In any case, however, the section consists of an edge of the tube folded in a spiral and shaped so as to allow the necessary elasticity for the pieces to be assembled.In the variants in fig. 7 and fig. 8, flat elements 6 and 7 and right angle elements 8 and 9 allow prismatic tubes 10 to be formed in various sizes, as a function of the number of elements used.It is clear that the mouldings on the ends 3 and 4 along the generatrices of all the elements allow the ends of the spirals of the tube edges to come in contact with the spiral opposite to ensure a natural, mild pressure when the pieces are assembled.As a variation, moulidngs 3 and 4 may be sprinkled with a thin layer of glue to completely lock the tube in place.The invention offers the advantages cited above large quantities of disassembled ttibes may be shipped with minimum bulk, assembly and disassembly are simple, rapid and non specialized. It should be noted that the tubes according to this invention are assembled with no welding.Bends 3 and 4 along the generatrices are like ribbing to ensure the tube s rigidity and so allow very thinwalled tubes to be prepared,The elasticity arising from spring loaded bent loop 5 allows the walls to bend somewhat on contact, and so allows another element to be inserted and added to the tube.The invention is of particularly interesting appli cation in the area of metal tubes, where traditional manufacture involves preparation of complete tubes with normal diameters by means of rolling and welding or beating. For tubes in other materials, the more complicated manufacture is almost compietely compensated for by the advantages noted. Of course, the invention may include formal and sturctural variations in both the shape of the sprial mouldings 3 and 4 and their placement along the tube, in particular to allow placement of one half tube in another, In prismatic quadrangular section tubes 10, they may be conveniently placed on the edges.While the principle of the invention remains the same, the forms of realization and the particulars of construction may be widely varied from that described g and illustrated here, without however going beyond the bounds of the invention.
