# Filter device with solids conveyor.

## Abstract
Filtering devices wherein solid particulate matter is sepa rated by filter media 40, 46 from a liquid flow often contain conveying means 50 for moving the separated solid particu late to an external point for disposition. One such conveying means usable in filtering devices includes spaced endless 52,54 chain loops wherein each chain comprises alternate center links 62 pivotally joined by pins 66 to alternate sets of spaced side bars. In each center link is an elongated aper ture 90 which in a controlled manner holds an extension bar 84,86 attached to each end of a traversely positioned flight 76 . The spaced chain may be operatively connected to a source of rotary power 60 to periodically advance the con veying means so that the flights may be moved over a section of the filter media to effectively remove separated particulate matter collected thereon.
