# PRODUCTION OF DIPHENYLAMINE AND ANILINE FROM PHENOL AND AMMONIA

## Abstract
A process for the production of predetermined variable amounts of diphenylamine and aniline from a feedstock con sisting essentially of phenol and ammonia involves catalyti cally reacting phenol and ammonia to produce aniline in situ and then reacting part of the aniline with other phenol and aniline to produce DPA, with the remaining aniline being removed from the reaction media as product.
