# Rolling bearing assemblies fitted with seals.

## Abstract
A rolling bearing assembly fitted with seals for a bear ing chamber between two relatively rotatable components of the assembly. Each seal is mounted on one of the compo nents and has a resilient sealing lip in sliding contact with a sealing surface on the other component, the lip being deflected by the sealing surface in a direction away from the bearing chamber under normal running conditions. The side of the lip facing the chamber is formed with grooves arranged to permit air to flow past the seal in the event of the lip being drawn inwardly towards the bearing chamber by a reduced pressure therein. The side of the lip may be provided with ribs instead of grooves.
