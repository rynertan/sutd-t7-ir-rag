## Description
CONTROL DEVICE FOR A CRUNGE SPEED GEAR UNIT, PARTICULARLY FOR AMOTOR VEHICLEThis invention relates to a control device for a change speed gear unit, particularly for a rotor vehicle of the type in which the soverents of the gear lever are transmitted to the selector devices by flexible cables.The change speed gear lever of a rotor vehicle is currently connected to the selector sechinisms by way of suitable lever systems of rigid type The need fer operation without excessive play, idle travel and operating inaccuracies scans that the gear box and gear lever have f necessity ts be disposed a relatively short distance apart, so imposing limits en the overall vehicle design.To obviate these drawbacks, control devices using flexible cables have been proposed. However, such knows control devices use relatively high cost cables which have to be able to transmit both traction forces and compression forces to the selector scans of the change speed gear.The object of the present invention is to provide a change speed gear control device of the flexible cable type which is of low cost and of very simple construction and assembly.Said object is sttgioet according to the present invention by a control device for 9 rotor vehicle change speed gear, comprising a gear lever, selector scans controllable by said lever, and Z cable transmission system connecting the gear lever to the selector means, characterised in that the cable transmission system comprises a first inflexible rocker element rigid with the gear lever and coupled at its centre to a fixed support by scans of a universal joint, a cerresponding second inflexible rocker element coupled at its centre, by scans ef a universal joint, to a second support fixable to the gearbox, and three flexible ties provided with sheathes and connecting the rocker elerents together at the vertices f g triangle, the ends of the sheathes being retained by the two support elements.The present invention will be sore apparent from the non limiting description of two embodiients thereof given hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a diagraszatic view of a vehicle provided with the control device of the invention Figures 2 and 3 are two longitudinal views to an enlarged scale of two different details of the control device of Figure 1 respectively Figure 4 shows a possible modification of the detail of the control device illustrated in Figure 3.In Figure 1 the reference numeral 1 indicates overall a vehicle comprising a change speed gear unit 2, a steering wheel 3, a floor 4 and a control device 5 for the gear unit 2 comprising a gear lever 6, selector means 7, and a cable transmission system 8.With reference also to Figures 2 and 3, the selector means 7 can be connected to the gearbox 9 of the gear unit 2 Figure 3 , and comprise a shaft 10 disposed idly and mobile axially in the gearbox 9 and arranged to control the translatory movement of respective control forks of known type not shown which shift the gears of the gear unit 2, and a fork 15 carried in an angularly rigid manner on the shaft 10 at one end 16 thereof.The end 16 of the shaft 10 and the fork 15 are configured in such a manner as to be engaged by suitable sabers of the cable transmission system 8, so that on solving the lever 6, the shaft 10 can be side to rotate and or translate axially, in order to selectively control the translatory movement of each of the forks not shown for selecting the various gears of the gear unit 2.According to the invention, the cable transmission system 8 comprises a first inflexible rocker element 20 rigid with one end 21 of the gear lever 6, a corresponding second inflexible rocker element 22 disposed in a position corresponding with the selector scans 7, and three flexible ties 24, 25 and 26 respectively, which connect the rocker elements 20 and 22 together and are provided with sheathes 27 fixed at their opposite ends to two support elements 28 and 29 constituted by rigid plates, preferably of triangular shape, to which the rocker elements 20 and 22 are connected.The element 28 is arranged for fixing to the floor 4 of the vehicle 1, whereas the element 29 is provided with a bracket 30 for fixing to the gearbox 9.The rocker elements 20 and 22, which are preferably of triangular shape, also comprise three peripheral connection points 31 situated at the vertices of a triangle for the end 32 of the ties 24, 25, 26.With particular reference to Figures 2 and 3, the connection points 31 are preferably constituted by indentations formed in the elements 20 and 22, and provided with a through hole 31 in which the ends 32 of the ties 24, 25 and 26 engage by means of stop elements 36 of inown type.The lower end 21 of the lever 6 is housed in a deformable sleeve 38 constructed far example ef rubber, and is provided lowerly with a seat 39 for housing a ball 40 acting as a universal joint, it being interposed between said end and a slidable support sleeve 41 disposed centrally in the support 28 and provided externally with a reaction spring 42 arranged to urge this latter towards the end 21.The described coupling device has the script of allowing a thrust to be exerted on the element 20 in such a manner that the tension in the cables becomes self adjusted. In the embodiment shown in Figure 2, the sleeve 38 and element 28 are mounted on the floor 4 by weans of a hinge 43, and are fixed on the opposite side by a disengageable latch 44 so that the lever 6 can be lowered into a horizontal position, shown by dashed lines inFigure 1.According to the invention, the second rocker element 22 is supported by the support element 29 by scans of a joint 45 constituted by two hemispherical indentations 46 provided in the two elements and cooperating with each other. Peratnent engagement between the indentations 46 is ensured by the traction of the ties 24, 25 and 26.Finally, the mechanical connection between the rocker element 22 and said selector means 7 is tsde by a pair of spherical head gppendices, 48 and 49 respectively, which are fixed rigidly to the element 22 and disposed at 900 to each other to engage respectively in the projecting end 16 of the shaft 10 and in the fork 15 carried thereby.The device operates in the following intuitive manner. On operating the lever 6, the element 20 can be made to rock relative to the element 28, with consequent movement of the element 22 in the sane direction and to the same extent as the element 28, to which it is connected by the ties 24, 25, 26.On putting either the pair of ties 24 and 26 or the pair of ties 24 and 25 aiiultaneously under tension, the element 22 can be made to rotate, in opposite directions, on the joint 45 with consequent lateral rocking Figure 3 of the appendix 49, which causes the fork 15 to rotate together with the shaft 10 which is angularly rigid with it, thus enabling a pair of gears to be selected. when the lever 6 is moved in such a manner that only the tie 24 is put under tension, this latter causes the element 22 to rotate on the joint 45, so that the shaft 10 undergoes outward translatory movement, with consequent engagement of a certain already selected gear in the gear unit 2. In contrast, if the lever 6 is moved in such a manner that the ties 25 and 26 are simultaneously put under tension, the shaft 10 is made to move in the opposite direction.Figure 4 shows a possible modification of the described control device. Those details which are similar or equal to those already described are indicated for simplicity by the same reference numerals.In particular, the modification of Figure 4 relates exclusively to the selection means of the described control device. As shown, the gearbox 9 is provided with an aperture 60, and the support element 29 is arranged for mounting directly against it in such a manner as to close the aperture 60.The corresponding ends of the sheathes 27 are fixed to the element 29, which is provided, on that side facing the interior of the gearbox 9, with 9 pivot 61 mounted to project perpendicularly and having spherical end which supports thereon a rocker element 62 identical to the rocker element 22, from which it differs only by the absence of the appendix 48. In contrast to the embodiment of Figure 3, the element 62 directly controls, by scans of a rectilinear appendix 65, the operation of the selection forks 14 for the gears of the gear unit 2.The movements of the element 62 are controlled in a manner analogous to that described for the element 22.The advantages obtainable by the control device constructed in accordance with the present invention are apparent from the aforegoing description. In this respect, it enables the gears of a change speed gear unit of known type to be selected and engaged by transmitting the control actions between the gear lever disposed in the vehicle passenger compartment and the selector scans disposed in proximity to or inside the gearbox exclusively by way of flexible cables, which operate only under tension. This allows maximum freedom in the relative positioning of the gearbox and gear lever, and ensures efficient and smooth operation of the control device, in that any jamming of the cables is inpossible as they operate only under tension. In this respect, it is apparent that because of the symmetry of the system by which the ties are connected to the elements 20 and 22, any movement of these latter produced by one of the cables being pulled against one of the connection points 31 causes the other cables to be pulled in the opposite direction. Finally, if the gear lever is mounted on the vehicle floor in the conventional position, the control device of the invention enables said gear lever to be lowered against the vehicle floor, so that it occupies no space, should this be advantageous. Fina11y from the description it is apparent that modifications can be made to the device without leaving the scope of the inventive idea.
