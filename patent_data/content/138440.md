# POINT SOURCE X RAY FOCUSING DEVICE

## Abstract
Point source X ray focusing device structures 48, 68 , materials and methods of forming them are provided which exhibit a greatly increased total reflected intensity for a desired X ray wavelength of interest. The devices 48, 68 include one or more focusing elements 50, 76, 78, 90, 108 , which each have a focusing surface 52, 80, 82, 92, 96 , with a plurality of layer pairs 54, 100 formed thereon. The focusing surface 52, 80, 82, 92, 96 and the layer pairs 54, 100 are designed to collect, reflect and concentrate the maximum X ray flux from a point source 28, 58, 70 to a focus point 32, 62, 88 for a particular wavelength of interest.
