# Electrochromic display employing potentiostatic erasure.

## Abstract
Completion of potentiostatic erasure of an electrochro mic display is detected by monitoring the erase current supplied to addressed display electrodes by potentiostatic erase drive means. The occurrence of a fall in erase current, corresponding to completion of the erasure of the address ed display electrodes, is detected, preferably by a threshold detector, and an erase completion indication produced. This indication effects disconnection of the erase current path.
