# Method and apparatus for measuring engine compression ratio, clearance volume and related cylinder parameters.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for measuring compression ratio and or clearance volume in an internal combustion engine cylinder wherein the crankshaft angle theta TDC associated with piston top dead center position is obtained and cylinder pressure P1, P2, P3, PTDC is measured at a number of incrementally spaced piston positions theta 1, theta 2, theta 3, theta TDC . Changes in cylinder volume V1 2, V2 3 between the incrementally spaced piston positions are determined from nominal engine design parameters. These multiple pressure and volume figures are then employed in a programmed microprocessor 64 to determine the constants gamma and k in the polytropic equation for relating cylinder pressure to volume PV gamma k. Clearance volume VTDC is determined using the constants gamma and k, and measured pressure at TDC or incremental volume figures. Compression ratio is determined by the fraction VDP VTDC VTDC, where VDP is total piston displacement volume obtained from nominal engine design parameters. The invention is also implemented to determine cylinder leakage during the compression stroke, angles of operation of the intake and exhaust valves, effective compression ratio where the intake valve does not close at BDC, and or cylinder intake pressure.

## Description
Method and Apparatus for Measuring Engine Compression Ratio, Clearance Volume and Related Cylinder Parameters The present invention is directed to measuring and testing of internal combustion engine parameters, and more particularly to a method and apparatus for measuring clearance volume at piston top dead center, cylinder compression ratio and or related cylinder parameters in an internal combustion engine.Background of the Invention Engine compression ratio in an internal combustion engine has long been recognized as an important control parameter for obtaining optimum and consistent engine performance. Knowledge and control of compression ratio is important, for example, in controlling engine knock , in controlling exhaust emissions and in achieving desired mileage performance. Hence, the ability accurately to determine compression ratio during the manufacturing process is of increasing interest and importance. Engine compression ratio may be expressed by the fraction VDP VTDC VTDC, where VDp is total displacement volume of the piston within the cylinder and VTDC is cylinder clearance volume or head space at piston top dead center TDC .Even if the intake valve closes after piston bottom dead center, the above definition is often used for analytical purposes.Piston displacement volume or VDp may be accurately obtained or determined from the mechanical design parameters and tolerances of engine component manufacture. However, clearance volume atTDC cannot be so obtained with desired accuracy, and the art has yet to propose a method for rapidly measuring VTDC in an assembled engine with the necessary and desired accuracy. Other engine parameters, such as the amount of cylinder leakage as the piston travels in the compression stroke towardTDC, actual angle of intake and exhaust valve operation relative to TDC, and effective intake pressure are also of interest, the last being of particular interest in connection with supercharged engines.Objects and Summary of the Invention A general object of the present invention, therefore, is to providea method for accurately measuring compression ratio within the cylinder of an internal combustion engine, and to provide an apparatus for performing such method. Another and more specific object of the invention is to provide a method and apparatus for accurately measuring clearance volume within the cylinder of an assembled engine. A further object of the invention is to provide a method and apparatus for rapidly measuring cylinder compression ratio and or clearance volume in real time with sufficient speed and accuracy to accommodate use on a mass production engine assembly line, and which avoids any need for interpretation by an operator. Yet another object of the invention is to provide a method and apparatus for measuring cylinder compression ratio and or clearance volume which may be used on either gasoline or diesel engines. A further object of the invention is to provide a method and apparatus which accomplishes the foregoing and which employs the information so measured to identify further engine test parameters such as the amount of cylinder leakage, the angle of intake valve closing and or exhaust valve opening, effective compression ratio and or effective intake pressure. Yet a further object of the invention is to provide a method and apparatus which is adapted to accomplish the foregoing in a production environment or a laboratory environment, which may be employed for testing engine components or assembled engines, and or which may be employed in an on vehicle engine control system. Another object of the invention is to provide a method and apparatus of the described character for accurately measuring selected thermodynamic parameters within the cylinder of an internal combustion engine. Briefly stated, the method and apparatus of the present invention employ the known relationship between cylinder pressure and volume expressed by the polytropic equation PVY k 1 where P is pressure, V is volume, and y and k are constants for a given cylinder for given ambient conditions. The method of the invention contemplates accurate location of piston TDC position in units of crankshaft angle of rotation and measurement of cylinder pressure P at a number of piston positions which are spaced from each other in terms of crankshaft angle by known increments. Piston displacement volume between successive rotation increments may be accurately predetermined from engine design parameters, as previously indicated.The constants y and k for the test cylinder are then accurately and rapidly determined in real time from the several pressure measurements and predetermined incremental displacement volumes by mathematical solution of multiple equations for multiple unknowns or by employing an iterative graphic analysis. In accordance with one implementation of the invention, clearance volume VTDC is then determined from equation 1 using measured pressure at TDC, and compression ratio is determined using the known total piston displacement volumeVDP. A second implementation of the invention contemplates determination of clearance volume VTDC without measuring cylinder pressure at TDC, which improves measurement accuracy by avoiding problems associated with cylinder leakage and gas dynamics near TDC. Indeed, the latter implementation can then be employed to quantify leakage in the test cylinder by predicting theoretical pressure at TDC, per equation 1 and then comparing such predicted pressure with actual measured pressure at TDC. The e information obtained per the foregoing may then be employed in accordance with further aspects of the invention to determine such engine parameters as effective closure angle of the intake valve, effective opening angle of the exhaust valve, effective compression ratio when the intake valve does not close precisely at piston bottom dead center BDC , and effective cylinder intake pressure. The latter two determinations are of particular interest in connection with supercharged engines. Brief Description of the Drawings The invention, together with additional objects, features and advantages thereof, will be best understood from the following description, the appended claims and the accompanying drawings in which FIG. 1 is a functional block diagram of a presently preferred embodiment of the apparatus in accordance with the invention coupled to an internal combustion engine FIG. 2 is an elevational fragmentary partially sectioned view on an enlarged scale as compared with FIG. 1 of a microwave pressure probe in accordance with the invention FIG. 3 is a sectional view taken along the line 3 3 inFIG. 2 FIG. 4 is a flow chart illustrating operation of the invention and FIGS. 5 7 are graphic illustrations not to scale useful in understanding operation of the invention. Detailed Description of Preferred Embodiments The preferred embodiments of the method and apparatus of the present invention employ techniques and principles which are disclosed in detail in the U.S. patent to ScottE. Wilson No. 4,331,029. This patent is assigned to the assignee hereof, and the entirety thereof is incorporated herein by reference. FIG. 1 illustrates a conventional V 6 gasoline internal combustion engine 10 which includes a distributor 12 coupled to a plurality of spark plugs 14. For measuring clearance volume and compression ratio in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention, engine 10 is mounted on a cold test stand not shown and has its crankshaft 16 coupled to a motor 18 so that the engine may be cycled without actual fuel ignition. One of the spark plugs 14 is removed from the cylinder block and a microwave pressure probe 20 in accordance with the invention is threaded into the engine cylinder bore in place thereof. Referring to FIGS. 2 and 3, probe 20 includes an outer metal sleeve 22 threaded at one end 24 so as to be adapted for reception into the vacated spark plug opening. A lip 26 radiates from the opposing end of sleeve 24 and has a circular recess 28 formed in the axial face thereof tangentially contiguous with and overlapping the central bore 30 of sleeve 22. A block 32 of insulating material such as plastic is mounted by the screws 33 on sleeve 22 overlying lip 26.Block 32 has an integral sleeve 34 telescopically received and extending through axial bore 30. The radially facing edge of sleeve 34 adjacent to lip 26 is flattened as at 36 in FIG. 3 so as to cooperate with the opposing wall of bore 30 to form a part cylindrical axial slot 38. Slot 38 extends from the tip of sleeve 22 at end 24 to recess 28 and is of sufficient cross sectional area to transmit pressure variations accurately. A length of coaxial cable 40 is snugly received within the central bore of sleeve 34. Cable 40 includes an outer insulation sheath 42 surrounding an outer conductor 44.A central or inner conductor 46 extends through cable 40 and is separated from outer conductor 44 by the insulation layer 48. Insulation layers 42,48 and outer conductor 44 terminate in assembly flush with the coplanar ends of sleeves 32,34 while the coax cable conductor 46 protrudes or extends therefrom. A protective cap 50 of Teflon or the like covers the tip of conductor 46 but does not cover the end of slot 38. A pressure transducer 52 such as a piezoelectric crystal is mounted within a pocket 54 in block 32 in open communication with recess 28. A pair of coax connectors 56,58 are mounted on block 32 and are respectively connected to coax cable 40 and pressure transducer 52. Thus, with probe 20 received into the cylinder block in place of a spark plug 14 FIG. 1 , pressure transducer 52 communicates with the cylinder interior through pocket 54, recess 28 and slot 38 to provide at connector 58 an electrical signal indicative of pressure variations within the test cylinder as the piston recipro ates therein. Returning to FIG. I, connector 58 on proj 20 is connected through a suitable pressure signal amplifier 63 o the process and control electronics 64. Likewise, probe connector 56 is connected through the microwave trarscei er electronics 62 to process and control ele tronics 64. o monitor or track rotation of crankshaft 16, a magnetic pick up 66 is positioned adjacent the starting ring g ar 69 such is coupled to the engine crankshaft.Pick up 66 is connected to a phase logked loop 70 to provide a periodic series C ulsed signals to electronics 64 at predetermined increments of crankshaft rotation, such as on the order of every C.1 . suitable phase locked loop 70 is illustrated in FIG. E cf the referencedWilson patent. The referenced patent alsc discloses an optical transducer which may be removably coupled to the engine crankshaft to monitor crankshaft rotation in place of pick up 66. Process and control electrrizs E4, which may comprise a suitably programmed conventional microprocessor, receives an input from an inductive pick up 72 operatively coupled to the cable of the spark plug 14 replaced by probe 20.This input is used to distinguish the compression power stroke of the associated piston from. the exhaust intake stroke.Process and control electronics 64 also includes conventional analog to digital conversion and sample and hold circuitry responsive to amplifier 60 and transceiver 62. Process and control electronics 64 provide output to a suitable display device 74 for providing a numerical display of compression ratio C R and clearance volume VTDC, and of the cylinder constants y and k if desired. Operation of the invention will be described in greater detail in connection with the flow diagram of FG. 4 and the graphic illustrations of FIGS. 5 and 6. More specifically,FIG. 5 includes a first graph 80 which illustrates the relationship of cylinder volume V to crankshaft angle 9 in the region around TDC, and a second graph 82 which iLlustrates the relationship of cylinder pressure P to crankshaft angle e in the same region It will be noted that cy r er volume V describes a symmetrical curve about a minimum clearance volume VTDC at the crankshaft angle ETD associated with the piston top dead center position. Cylinder pressure P is likewise illustrated as a symmetrical curve a ut a peak at TDC, although for some engines it is believed that the dynamics of gas behavior in a motored engine n ay place maximum cylinder pressure slightly ahead of the piston top dead center angle. Operation of the invention is not affected by location of peak pressure. Also, these curves may have a slight, predictable asymmetry due to engine design parameters such as wrist pin offset. The illustrations of FIG. 5, which are not to scale, cover an angular range during the compression power stroke of the piston in which all valves are closed.It is presently preferred to perform the method of the invention while the engine is cold motored by an external source 18 because changes in cylinder pressure with all valves closed may be related directly to changes in volume due to piston motion, as will be described. With the spark plug 14 removed and the probe 20 inserted in place thereof, the engine is cold motored by the motor 18 and microwave signals are injected by transceiver electronics 62 and probe 20 into the cylinder volume or bore. As the piston reciprocates within the cylinder, the microwave signals exhibit a plurality of resonance peaks which are generally symmetrical around piston TDC.Process and control electronics is responsive to the microwave resonance signals directed thereto by transceiver electronics 62, and to the crankshaft rotation signals obtained from phase locked loop 70, for accurately identifying the crankshaft angle associated with piston TDC, i.e. OTDC The process for locating OTDC is described in greater detail in the referenced Wilson patent, and reference is made thereto for a more detailed description of the preferred method for locating piston TDC in practice of the present invention.Although microwave range radiation is specifically disclosed in Wilson and is presently preferred, it is envisioned that radiation in other frequency ranges, such as X rays or ultrasonics, may be used in appropriate circumstances while applying the Wilson technique for identifying TDC from the radiation return signal. As a next step, three angles 61, 62 and 63 are selected at spaced intervals with respect to 6TDC In the illustration of FIG. 5, angles Oi, 2, 63 and TDC are at equally spaced intervals during the piston compression stroke.Cylinder pressure as indicated by probe 20 and pressure signal amplifier 60 is then measured at each angle 1, 2, 63 and TDC to obtain corresponding pressure signals P1, P2, P3 and PTDC which are stored in memory. It is presently considered preferable, although not necessary, to measure pressure on several successive compression strokes, and to utilize average pressures for further computations. As previously indicated, the changes in cylinder volume during the intervals between the selected angles 6i, 62 and 63 may be accurately determined as a function of engine mechanical design parameters.These incremental displacement volumes V1 and V23 may be either precalculated for predetermined values of 1, 62 and 63 and stored in memory for later retrieval, or may be rapidly calculated in real time within process and control electronics 64 from design parameter operator inputs not shown . The constants y and k for the specific cylinder under test and the volume V1 at crankshaft angle 81 are then identified.Two techniques for finding y, k and V1 are presently preferred. In the first technique, initial volume V1 and the constants y and k are obtained by solution of the following three equations for at least two y and k and preferably three unknowns P1V1 gamma k 2 P2 V1 V1 2 gamma k 3 P3 V1 V1 2 V2 3 gamma k 4 These.equations are readily solved using conventional microprocessor techniques for V1, y and k from measured pressuresP1, P2 and P3 and from incremental displacement volumes V1 2 and V2 3 determined on the basis of engine design parameters. Alternatively, and in accordance with the second technique, the constant y and the volume V1 are found using an iterative graphic technique. First, equations 2 4 above are rearranged as follows EMI15.1 EMI16.1 Knowing the approximate or nominal value of V1 and y from the mechanical design, progressively varying values of V1 or y around nominal are substituted into equations 5 7 , again using the measured pressures P1, P2, P3 and the computed or precomputed incremental displacement volumes V12 and v Solutions of these three equations for y for various values of V1 or for V1 for various values of y yield the three curves 84,86 and 88 illustrated in FIG. 6. These three curves intersect at a point 90 which corresponds to the actual volume V1 and the actual constant y associated with the test cylinder.With y, P1 and V1 in hand, the constant k is given by the equation k P1V1Y 8 It will be appreciated that the iterative graphic technique may be readily performed using conventional microprocessor techniques without resorting to a manual graphic solution.Likewise, the point 90 of intersection may be found using only two of the three equations 5 , 6 and 7 . However, the use of three equations is preferred for enhanced accuracy over the full range of tolerances in engine design and the reliability tolerances of cylinder pressure measurement. That is, it may be expected under actual operating conditions that the three lines 84,86,88 do not intersect at a single point. Use of a third graph line helps to identify an average intersection point 90 with greater accuracy. Returning to FIG. 4, with the constants k and y identified and the pressure PTDC at piston top dead center measured per the above, the clearance volume VTDC at piston top dead center may be obtained per the equation EMI17.1 Compression ratio C R may then be obtained per the equation VTDC VDP C R VTDC 10 As a final step in the process of FIG. 4, clearance volumeVTDC and compression ratio C R may be displayed to the test system operator. Likewise, in analytical or research applications for example, other parameters such as y and k for the engine and cylinder under test may be displayed if desired. One potentially useful modification to the embodiments and techniques of the invention hereinabove discussed involves substitution of VTDC for V1 as the arbitrarily selected starting volume, which would eliminate both the extra computation step of equation 9 and the necessity of measuring pressure P1 at angle 61. Thus, equations 2 4 may take the form TDC TDC 11 P3 VTDC V3 TDC gamma k 12 P2 VTDC V3 TDC V2 3 gamma k 13 where P2, P3 and PTDC are average pressures measured at 2, 3 and TDC in FIG. 5, and V3 TDC and V2 3 are incremental displacement volumes calculated or precalculated as previously described.Note that these equations may be directly solved for VTDC, as well as for y and k. The iterative graphic technique of equations 5 7 and FIG. 6 may likewise be modified by substituting VTDC for V1. Another modification of potential interest involves measurement of total displacement volume VDp rather than, or in addition to, calculation or precalculation thereof as previously described. In this modification, assuming that all valves are closed at piston bottom dead center, total displacement volume is measured as a function of the equation VDP VBDC VTDC 14 where VBDC is cylinder volume at piston bottom dead center.To obtain VBDct the crankshaft angle associated with piston BD is first obtained. In theory, this angle, 6BDC is equal to TDC 180 . In actual practice, however, factors such as wrist pin offset, etc. are such that BDC is slightly displaced from TDC 1800. This displacement can be calculated from engine design parameters.When BDC has been identified, a corresponding average PBDC iS obtained, and VBDC is determined from the equation EMI19.1 Compression ratio may then be obtained as VTDC VDP VTDC VBDC VTDC C R VTDC VTDC 16 VBDC VTDCComparison of the compression ratio measurement made as described above with a measurement obtained as previously described may be used to detect engine faults or compression ratio measurement error caused, for example, by unsealed piston rings. It is also possible, within the scope of the invention, to instrument two different cylinders for microwave and pressure measurement, or indeed to instrument all cylinders for pressure but only one cylinder for microwave where compression ratio, clearance volume, y or k are to be measured at all cylinders, for example. In these cases, TDC for each cylinder would be determined by adding an appropriate angular increment to the 6TDC measured for the microwave instrumented cylinder. In a similar manner, two different cylinders could be instrumented for microwave and pressure measurements when the use of specialized pressure transducers, such as a flush mounted pressure transducer, is desirable. Such flush mounting may improve accuracy in the measurement of pressure variations, and thus overall accuracy of cylinder parameter measurement, under some conditions. Thus, the method of the invention to the extent thus far described contemplates identification of crankangle 6TDC at piston top dead center. Most preferably, this is accomplished using the microwave techniques disclosed in the referenced Wilson patent. Pa,Pb,PC are measured at pre determined angles Oa 6b and 6 incrementally spaced from C 6TDC Cylinder pressure PTDC is then measured at the TDC crankangle 6TDC One of the positions 6a, 6b or 0c may be OTDC Most preferably, these incremental angles are equal, and the pressure measurements are taken when all valves are closed during the piston compression stroke.Incremental displacement volumes Va b and V b c are calculated or, more preferably, precalculated for the type of engine under test from nominal engine design parameters. With the pressure readings Pa,Pb,PC and the displacement volumes Va b,Vb c in hand, equation 1 may be expressed in the form of three equations, which may then be solved for the two unknown constants y and k, and also for the initial reference volume Va, which may be VTDC Where V a is not VTDc, and knowing y and k for the cylinder under test, clearance volume VTDC may be determined using equation 1 and PTDC. A second technique for identifying the unknowns y, k and Va is an iterative graphic solution of two dimensions to locate the point of graphic intersection. This point of intersection corresponds to the actual solution, and yields the desired unknowns.Most preferably, either technique is employed in real time using a suitably programmed conventional digital microprocessor. Thus, one aspect of the method of the invention contemplates measurement of y, k or clearance volume VTDC as previously described. Another aspect of the method contemplates determination of compression ratio C R for the cylinder under test as a function of the fraction VTDC VDp VTDC whereVDP is total piston displacement volume. Total displacement volume is obtained either as a calculated or precalculated function of engine design parameters, or by measuring the volume VBDC at piston bottom dead center if all valves are closed, in accordance with equation 15 . Probes conventionally employed for measuring cylinder pressure provide what may be envisioned as the varying or differential portion of the pressure signal. In applying the specific techniques heretofore discussed, this varying pressure signal must be added to a reference level to obtain an absolute pressure measurement Par Pb, etc. See Lancaster et al, Measurement and Analysis of Engine Pressure Data ,SAE Paper No. 750026 1975 at page 5 or Brown, Methods for Evaluating Requirements and Errors in Cylinder PressureMeasurement , SAE Paper No. 670008 1967 at pages 66 67. Regardless of whether a given probe provides differential or absolute pressure measurements, the principles of the invention hereinbefore discussed may be implemented equally as well by employing only the pressure differential portion of the signal and discarding any absolute pressure information, thereby avoiding the need to measure a reference level or rely upon a precalibrated indication of reference level. More specifically, all absolute pressure measurements may be envisioned as the sum of an unknown reference level PO and a differential pressure APn, which may be the difference between the sinusoidal probe pressure signal at angle n and the pressure signal at BDC following the intake stroke, for example.Pressure measurements are taken at four points a, 6b, c, 6d, yielding four pressure differential signals APa, APb, APC and APd. Using equation 1 to establish four independent equations analogous to equations 2 through 4 , each of the unknowns y, k, V1 and P may be obtained employing either mathematical or iterative techniques analogous to those previously discussed. It will be appreciated from the graph 82 in FIG. 5 that resolution of pressure versus crank angle is at a minimum at TDC. Moreover, as previously noted, the dynamics of gas behavior at or near TDC may cause cylinder behavior to depart somewhat from theoretical equation 1 . Cylinder leakage, if any, would normally maximize around TDC. To overcome these and other difficulties, another important modification to the implementations of the invention heretofore discussed obtains improved accuracy by measuring VTDC without measuring PTDc FIG. 7 is a graphic illustration not to scale which relates piston volume V to various crank angles 6n and complements FIG. 5 heretofore discussed.Volume V1 is first determined per the previous discussions by measuring pressures P1, P2, P3 at angles 611 2, 03 determining differential volumes V1 2 and V2 3 from engine design geometry, and mathematically implementing equations 2 4 or iteratively implementing equations 5 7 . Instead of employing equation 9 to find VTDC from PTDC, however, engine design geometry is again referenced to find differential volume V1 TDC between crank angles 61 and 6TDC Volume VTDC is then found as VTDC V1 V1 TDC 17 Constants k and gamma may be determined as before.In addition to avoiding difficulties associated with measuring PTDC, this aspect of the invention permits VTDC to be measured during actual engine operation, where PTDC would be greatly affected by combustion, by obtaining all necessary pressure data well ahead of TDC before combustion is initiated. The foregoing aspect of the invention leads to yet another application for measuring or quantifying cylinder leakage during the compression stroke. That is, clearance volume VTDC and constants y and k are first determined using the method set forth immediately above which does not require measurement of PTDC A theoretical or predicted pressure at TDC is then identified as a function of the equation TDC k 18 TDCActual cylinder pressure PTDC is then measured at 6TDC and may be averaged over several cycles. The difference P PTDC is thus a measure of pressure leakage, which may be due to improperly installed or defective piston rings, etc. It will be appreciated, of course, that this method of quantifying cylinder leakage is best carried out while cold motoring the engine.However, the principle of this method may also be applied during actual engine operation. Evaluation of predicted versus actual pressure is performed at a crankshaft position somewhat prior to start of combustion. Cylinder volume at this crankshaft position is determined as a function of volume V1 from equation 17 and engine design parameters. Regardless of which crankshaft position is used, pressure readings for determination of cylinder volume, k and y are taken at an early portion of the compression cycle after the intake valve has closed but before substantial compression and possible leakage has taken place. Yet another application of the invention contemplates determination of the effective or equivalent angle of valve operation i.e. the crankshaft angle during the intake compression cycle at which the intake valve closes, and or the crank angle during the power exhaust cycle at which the exhaust valve opens. Simply stated, this is accomplished by first determining k, y and VTDC per any of the foregoing techniques. Due to potential heat loss from the compressed gas to the surrounding structure, k and y are computed for the compression stroke and recomputed for the power stroke. Of course, all pressure readings for determining y, k andVTDC must be taken at crank angles where all valves are known to be closed. VTDC and engine design geometry yield volume as a function of crank angle i.e., V 6 . Pressure readings are then taken during cold motoring through the intake compression and power exhaust cycles, and are compared with predicted pressures per equation 1 and V 6 to locate those angles 6V at which equation 1 is no longer valid, which means that the cylinder is no longer a closed cylinder. During the power exhaust cycle, this angle 0V is the effective angle of exhaust valve opening. During the intake compression cycle, this angle is the effective angle of intake valve closure. Most conventionally, compression ratio is defined per equation 16 as a simple volume ratio. However, in much of the literature on two stroke engines, compression ratio is defined with reference to cylinder volume at intake port closure rather than VBDC in an attempt to accommodate substantial piston compression travel with the intake port open. See Taylor, The Internal Combustion Engine in Theory and Practice, MIT Press, 2nd Ed. 1966 , Vol. 1, p. 216.The same may be said for specialized four stroke engines wherein the intake valve remains open well after BDC. For such engines, effective compression ratio can be determined in accordance with yet another implementation of the invention. Applying equations 1 and 16 , compression ratio C R can be expressed as EMI28.1 However, in those applications where the angle 6V of intake valve closure is well after BDC, effective compression ratioC R may be defined as V6V V C R 20 VTDC orEMI28.2 Thus, after determining gamma , k and V per the foregoing discussion, volumes V V and VTDC may be identified and effective compression ratio C R identified per equation 20 , or pressures PTDC and P V may be measured at TDC and V respectively, and effective compression ratio C R determined per equation 21 . An analogous application of the invention to that discussed immediately above contemplates determination of effective intake pressure. This aspect of the invention finds particular utility with respect to supercharged engines where a compressor or the like is employed to raise intake pressure above ambient. Solving equation 19 for intake pressure at BDC EMI29.1 Compression ratio VBDc VTDc constant y and pressure PTDC may be determined or measured per the foregoing discussion, and equation 22 then solved for effective intake pressure.Alternatively, equation 22 may be expressed as EMI29.2 where pressure P and volume V correspond to crankangle a a Oa and volume Ve to measured or nominal intake valve closure angle QV The invention is applicable to the various aspects of engine research, design, production, diagnosis, operation and control. For example, in the production of engine heads, this invention may be employed to measure the volumes of the cavities that correspond to the individual cylinders. The engine head, with valve and spark plug holes sealed, may be affixed temporarily to a permanent fixture that resembles a cold motored engine without a head.This fixture may be constructed so as to allow adequate cylinder height for incorporation of a valve and a pressure sensor for each cylinder. During motoring of the reciprocating pistons within the cylinders of the fixture, the volumes of the individual cavities can be derived by use of the invention as described hereinabove. Machining operations may then be employed to modify these cavity volumes, if required. Another example of the application of the invention is found in the field of engine operation and control. In this application, the engine may be instrumented so as to provide continuous information about crankshaft Position. Each cylinder may be instrumented with a pressure sensor, such as that described in Randall and Powell, A Cylinder Pressure Sensor forSpark Advance Control and Knock Detection , SAE Paper No. 790139 1979 . The invention may then be employed to monitor such factors as cylinder volume change caused by either engine component wear or the accumulation of carbon deposits, and cylinder leakage caused, for example, by engine component wear. Information gained in this manner can be used by the engine control system to further optimize engine operation. The invention also contemplates apparatus for determining cylinder thermodynamic constants k and y, cylinder clearance volume, compression ratio, cylinder leakage, valve operation, effective compression ratio and or effective intake pressure in accordance with the foregoing method, including in particular a dual microwave pressure probe adapted to communicate with the cylinder bore. The invention claimed is
