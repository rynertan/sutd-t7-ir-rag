The invention includes the separate isomers and their mixtures in all proportions. The compounds may be prepared by a variety of methods.One procedure is outlined in Scheme A bel ow Scheme AEMI3.1 b III w ZR1 base I In Scheme A, the symbol Z stands for chlorine, bromine or iodine. According to Scheme A, a suitably substituted aldehyde or ketone 11, R1 H or alkyl is reacted in a solvent or diluent with hydroxylamine to give an oxime derivative III . Suitable reaction conditions for preparing oximes of aldehydes and ketones of this type are well known in the art, being described for example in columns 9 and 10 ofUnited States Patent 4344789, the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference. In stage b of Scheme A, the oxime prepared in stage a is reacted with the appropriate halogeno compound ZR1 to obtain the required final product I . Conveniently the reaction may be carried out with a lower alkanol e.g. a C1 C4 alkanol as solvent, and with a metal alkoxide as a base. Thus the oxime III may be dissolved in the alkanol and added to a equimolar amount of the sodium alkoxide in solution in the alkanol. The halogeno compound ZR1 is then added. If reaction is slow at room temperature, the mixture may be heated, for example at reflux. When reaction is sufficiently complete, the product I may be isolated by standard methods. Thus the reaction mixture may be evaporated and the residue shaken with water and chloroform, and the chloroform solution dried and evaporated to give the product. For compounds in which X is halo, nitro, methyl orCF3, the aldehydes and ketones II required as starting materials in Scheme A may be prepared by reaction of the appropriate carbonyl substituted metal phenoxide V with, for example, a l,4 difluoro 5 Y suDstituted benzotrifluoride IV to give diphenyl ether derivative VI as shown belowEMI4.1 In the above scheme, the symbol M stands for a metal cation, for example, sodium or potassium. The reaction conditions for preparation of diphenyl ethers by this procedure are well known in the art, being described for example in United States Patent 4344789. In the case of compounds of formula I where X stands for nitro or chlorine, bromine or iodine the preparation of the intermediate VI may also be carried out by reacting a benzotrifluoride IV with a phenoxide V in which X is hydrogen, so as to obtain an intermediate VI in which X is hydrogen this is then nitrated, or halogenated by standard methods to give the required intermediate VI in which X is nitro, chloro, bromo or iodo. The compounds of the invention are useful as herbicides. In another aspect, therefore, the invention provides a process of inhibiting the growth of unwanted plants, which comprises applying to the plants, or to the locus thereof, a phytotoxic amount of a compound of the formula I as hereinbefore defined. The amount of the compound to be applied in the process may vary, depending upon the particular compound chosen, and the identity of the plant species whose growth is to be inhibited, but in general amounts from 0.020 to 10 kilograms per hectare will be suitable in many cases from 0.25 to 1.0 kilograms per hectare will be appropriate. The skilled worker in the herbicide art will readily be able to establish appropriate application rates by standard procedures without undue experimentation. The compounds of the invention are effective in controlling a variety of unwanted plants. The compounds may be applied to the above ground parts of unwanted plants post emergence application or they may be applied to the soil to prevent the growth of plants from seeds present in the soil pre emergence application . The compounds may be used, for example, for the selective control of weeds in crops of soya bean. The compounds used in the process of the invention are preferably applied in the form of a composition, in which the active ingredient is mixed with a carrier comprising a solid or liquid diluent. In another aspect, therefore, the invention provides a herbicidal composition, comprising as an active ingredient a compound of the formula I as hereinbefore defined, in admixture with a solid or liquid diluent. Preferably the composition also comprises a surface active agent. The solid compositions of the invention may be for example, in the form of dusting powders, or may take the form of granules. Suitable solid diluents include, for example, kaolin, bentonite, kieselguhr, dolomite, calcium carbonate, talc, powdered magnesia, and Fuller s earth. Solid compositions may also be in the form of dispersible powders or grains comprising in addition to the active ingredient, a wetting agent to facilitate the dispersion of the powder or grains in liquids. Such powders or grains may include fillers, suspending agents and the like. Liquid compositions include aqueous solutions, dispersions and emulsions containing the active ingredient preferably in the presence of one or more surface active agents. Water or organic liquids may be used to prepare solutions, dispersions, or emulsions of the active ingredient. The liquid compositions of the invention may also contain one or more corrosion inhibitors for example lauryl isoquinolinium bromide. Surface active agents may be of the cationic, anionic or non ionic type. Suitable agents of the cationic type include for example quaternary ammonium compounds, for example cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide. Suitable agents of the anionic type include for example soaps, salts. of aliphatic mono esters of sulphuric acid, for example sodium lauryl sulphate and salts of sulphonated aromatic compounds, for example dodecyl benzenesulphonate, sodium, calcium and ammonium ligno sulphonate, butylnaphthalene sulphonate, and a mixture of the sodium salts of diisopropyl and triisopropyl naphthalenesulphonic acid.Suitable agents of the non ionic type include, for example1 the condensation products of ethylene oxide with fatty alcohols such as oleyl alcohol and cetyl alcohol, or with alkyl phenols such as octylphenol, nonylphenol, and octylcresol. Other non ionic agents are the partial esters derived from long chain fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example sorbitol monolaurate the condensation products of the said partial esters with ethylene oxide and the lecithins. The compositions which are to be used in the form of aqueous solutions, dispersions or emulsions are generally supplied in the form of concentrate containing a high proportion of the active ingredient, the concentrate being diluted with water before use. These concentrates are usually required to withstand storage for prolonged periods and after such storage to be capable of dilution with water in order to form aqueous preparations which remain homogeneous for a sufficient time to enable them to be applied by conventional spray equipment. The compositions of the invention may contain, in addition to carriers and surface active agents, various other constituents to increase their usefulness. They may contain, for example, buffering salts to maintain the pH of the composition within a desired range antifreeze agents, for example urea or propylene glycol adjuvants, for example, oils and humectants and sequestrants, for example citric acid and ethylenediaminetetracetic acid, which help to prevent the formation of insoluble precipitates when the compositions are diluted with hard water. Aqueous dispersions may contain anti settling agents and anticaking agents. The compositions may in general contain a dye or pigment to impart a characteristic colour. Agents for increasing viscosity may be added to reduce the formation of fine droplets during spraying, and thereby reduce spray drift. Other additives useful for particular purposes will be known to those skilled in the formulation art. In general concentrates may conveniently contain from 10 to 85 and preferably from 25 to 60 by weight of active ingredient. Dilute preparations ready for use may contain varying amounts of the active ingredient, depending upon the purpose for which they are to be used however, dilute preparations suitable for many uses contain between 0.01 and 10 and preferably between 0.1 and 1 by weight of the active ingredient.
