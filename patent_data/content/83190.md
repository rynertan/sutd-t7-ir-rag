# Process for producing polybutadiene rubber with enhanced mechanical strength.

## Abstract
A polybutadiene rubber having an enhanced mechanical strength is produced in such a manner that the contents of water and carbon disulfide in a solution of 1,3 butadiene and carbon disulfide in an inert organic solvent is controlled to 0.2 to 5 m moles and 20 m moles or less, respectively, per liter of the 1,3 butadiene carbon disulfide solution a first polymerization mixture is prepared from the controlled 1,3 butadiene carbon disulfide solution, an organic aluminum compound of the formula Al R
