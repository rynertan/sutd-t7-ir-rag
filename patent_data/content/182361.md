The large picture display device comprises a push latch stopper mounted to the display unit, a push latch mounted to the support frame and adapted to mate with the push latch stopper, and a spring means provided on the support frame. With this arrangement, when the display unit is inserted into the support frame, the push latch stopper is engaged with the push latch to be locked, thereby permit ing the display unit to be retained by the support frame.
