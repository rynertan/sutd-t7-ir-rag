## Abstract
The assembly 11 includes a flexible bellows 19 surrounding the shaft 13 and secured at one end thereto. An annular face seal is fixed and sealed to the other end of the bellows 19 and is biased by the bellows into sealing engagement with the stationary member 17 . The means which secures and seals the face seal to the bellows 19 includes a flexible member 47 which closely surrounds the shaft 13 and dampens vibrations induced in the bellows 19 . The bellows seal assembly 11 includes stamped sheet metal parts 41,43 and can be used when the assembly is to be secured to the stationary member 17 and the face seal to engage a radial face 39 on the shaft.
