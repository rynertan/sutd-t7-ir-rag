# Rotary machine.

## Abstract
A rotary machine includes a stator housing 10, 12 hav ing an inner surface 16 defining a stator chamber 18 and inlet and outlet ports 36, 38 . A cylindrical rotor 20 is rotat ably mounted within the chamber and has a plurality of vanes 22 slidably mounted therein and movable with the rotor with their tip portions projecting outwardly towards the inner sur face 16 of the stator housing. A cylindrical cam surface 28 is provided at each end of the stator housing, substantially con centric with the inner surface 16 of the housing. Two cam followers 30 are mounted on each of the vanes and contact the cam surfaces. A cam follower retaining means 32 cooperating with each cam surface is freely rotatable with respect to the associated cam surface and defines a substan tially cylindrical retaining surface 34 which is concentric with the cam surface. The cam followers 30 thus position the vanes during rotation of the rotor.
