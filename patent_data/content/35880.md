# Pre reacted carboxylic acid anhydride complexes as low temperature curing agents for epoxy resins.

## Abstract
A low temperature, fast curing epoxy insulating composi tion is made by low temperature mixing an epoxy resin with a carboxylic acid anhydride complex, the anhydride complex being the low temperature reaction product of a selected Lewis Acid catalyst and a carboxylic acid anhydride.
