# Process for concurrent formation of base diffusion and p profile from single source predeposition.

## Abstract
A single source predeposition is required to concurrently form a base diffusion profile and p profile. For a boron doped silicon semiconductor devices this can be accomp lished by depositing a silicon nitride layer 34 directly over a boron source glass layer 32 . After opening windows 36,36 to the underlying silicon 10 , diffusion in a wet oxide atmos phere results in formation of a resulting oxide 40 in the windows with expenditure of boron by diffusion into this oxide as well as diffusion into the underlying substrate at a reduced concentration. In adjacent areas masked by the sili con nitride the boron source diffuses unidirectionally into the substrate yielding a maximum dopant concentration.
