## Description
PREPARATION OF REAGENTSThis invention relates to the preparation and use of reagents. especially for example the preparation and use of dried forms of enzymatically active reagents. e.g.reagents suitable for enzyme linked specific binding assays such as ELISA assays, using enzymes conJugated to antigens. antibodies or other specific binding materials.The invention also relates to reagent kits including such dried preparations.The prior art includes many dried forms of biologically active reagents including serological reagents such as antibodies. enzymes and their coupling products. For example. USP LL 23ill 316 Hevey . in describing devices for delivering precise measured quantities of a plurality of water soluble reagents. carried on impervious supports.mentions in particular devices for carrying out radioimmunoassay for T4 comprising plastic carriers carrying film dried down from a solution of 20X dextran 70,000 m.w. contsining concentrated antiserum anti T4 for use as one of the reagent components of the radioimmunoassay. and other plastic carriers carrying film containing T4 standards in human serum. Also mentioned in USP 4 234 316 are reagents for clinical tests comprising carrier based films containing inter alia enzymes. enzyme substrates. antibodies, antigens. haptens. and reagents carrying radioisotopic, fluorescent. enzyme, or cofactor tags.Binders are disclosed for use in such films selected from polymeric materials such as inter alia dextran, acrylic gels and various gums. together with humectants. surface active agents and low m.w. substances such as sorbitol. tartrate. mannose and sucrose.It is also known to use sugars in the preparation of dried forms of reagent for immunological tests. e.g. in the preparation of immunoadsorbents, as in GB 2 016 687 Abbott .Our experience in the use of compositions analogous to those of the prior art has not been entirely satisfactory thus, although it is clear that they do give dried reagents with a degree of stability and preserved activity, we find that they are often considerably less effective in preserving and stabilising enzymatically active material. such as enzyme conJugates, than they are in preserving the antibody activity of immunoglobulin.For example. in one test, a sugar preparation which preserved near 100X of an antibodY activity only left 30X of an enzymic preparation in an active state. For some purposes such a degree of stabilisation may be adequate, but better preservative techniques are needed for some tests in which the quantity of enzyme activity is directly related to a quantitative or semiquantitative test result.It is an aim of this invention to provide dried preparations of enzymatically active reagent materials which can yield improved preservation and stability.It is another aim of this invention to provide dried preparations of enzymatically active materials which can quickly release their content into solution or dispersion upon contact with aqueous reaction media.It is a further aim of the invention to provide dried preparations of enzymatically active materials which can pive satisfactory consistency of preservation of their enzymatic activity on storage. e.g. without refrigeration and even under tropical conditions.According to the invention there is provided in a dried preparation of enzymatically active reagent material suitable for use as a reagent in a test procedure requiring said enzymatically active material, said preparation comprising a dried layer incorporating said enzymatically active material together with a carrier or binder material suitable to release said enzymatically active material upon contact with an aqueous reaction liquid, the improvement whereby said dried layer comprises, together with said enzymatically active material, a stabilising amount of a protein which is inert with respect to the test reaction in which said enzymatically active material is to participate, and optionally a layer forming quantity of a sugar or sugar derivative.The dried preparations are generally carried on inert solid substrates. e.g. water impermeable and insoluble substrates such as plastics or glass as more particularly described hereinbelow. According to one form of the invention, we have found it possible to provide a convenient and relatively stable dry preparation of an enzyme which has been covalently coupled to other material, e.g. an antibody. to form a conjugate, comprising a dried amount of the conjugate, together with an inert protein indifferent to the assay reaction s in which the conjugate is to take part, and a sugar or sugar derivative. preferably dried from a buffered salt solution. The preparation quickly releases the conjugate upon rehydration.The invention extends to the corresponding processes of producing such dried preparations, and to the use of such preparations as reagents in test methods such as specific binding assays, e.g. enzyme linked immunoassays.The invention also extends to test kits for such assays which comprise such dried preparations, for example a test kit for an immunoassay comprising an enzyme conjugated with a member of a specific binding pair relevant to the assay. in dried form as described herein, together with other reagents including another member of said specific binding pair and a substrate for said enzyme.Sugars and sugar derivatives useful in connexion with these preparations include saccharides and saccharide alcohols, e.g. lactose. maltodextrin, sucrose or trehalose. These can be used in for example the form of solutions for drying down, suitably at up to about 20X w v concentration, e.g. within the range of about 5X 10X w v. We have found that lactose and trehalose have been associated with best results in certain tests such as those detailed below. Suitable examples of enzymatically active reagent materials which can be stabilised in dry form according to the present invention include for example a conjugate comprising an immunoglobulin with antibody specificity chemically coupled to an enzyme. such as for example alkaline phosphatase. Such a conjugate can be made by any of a number of well known methods not constituting the present invention. e.g. by glutaraldehyde coupling technique.Other examples of enzymes which can form part of conjugates to be stabilised by the means described herein are peroxidase, e.g. horseradish peroxidase. glucose oxidase. and catalase among other.Suitable examples of inert proteins include albumins, e.g. bovine serum albumin or ovalbumin, and especially reagent grade preparations of such albumins. These can be used preferably for example at a concentration in the liquid which is to be dried down within the range of about 0.5X w v conveniently for example about 1X w v up to about 6X w v, e.g. within the range of about 0.5X to 3X, or P3X to 6X. In certain test examples made with sucrose, major improvement in stabilised enzyme activity was achieved by including 1X w v reagent grade ovalbumin, with lesser improvement arising with larder amounts of the inert protein up to about 4 w v. Higher concentrations of the protein and the sugar or sugar derivative than those quoted are often operable but sometimes give no additional benefit.It can be very desirable also to include in the dried preparations a further material such as a salt and or buffer, especially a further material which contains an ion or cofactor corresponding to the enzyme activity to be preserved. and functioning as an adjuvant of the preservative or otherwise. For example, where a phosphatase is the enzymatic activity of interest, it is desirable to include a magnesium salt in the dried preparation. A useful example of such a material is magnesium chloride tris HCl. pH 8, especially in the case of alkaline phosphatase as the material to be stabilised.Salt and buffer concentrations can be chosen within a wide range at will.Optional and desirable further ingredients are viscosity additives such as polyethyleneglycol, e.g. PEG 6000 at about for example 1.5X w v. and detergents such as Triton, e.g. Triton QS9 at about 0.01 w v Trade Mark . Prior art other additives for dry preparations may also be present.Up to 30 polyethyleneglycol and 0.2X Triton have been found usable and to lack deleterious effect on the preservation of the enzyme and antibody activity, besides possibly conferring advantage in the subsequent use of the reagent.The substrate for the drying can be glass e.g. a borosilicate glass tube , or plastics such as polystyrene e.g. wells of a microtitre plate or nylon such as the surface of a stick. bead, strip or peg . Generally the substrate can have any shape or form that may be desired or convenient for the performance of a test or assay in which the enzymatically active material is to participate. The thickness of the dried layer can be chosen according to convenience, and is not particularly critical suitable thicknesses have been found for example in the range up to about 50 microns, and sometimes up to about 0.1 mm. It can be convenient to apply the liquid to be dried to the surface of the solid substrate at a rate of for example within the order of about 0.2 2 microliter per square centimeter of surface to carry the active layer. Other rates of application however can well be chosen.The drying process can be carried out by air drying, vacuum drying or lYophilisation, e.g. vacuum drying after freezing in solid carbon dioxide at 80 deg. C. We find that air drying in an oven at about for example 37 deg. C is a convenient method of drying and one that can show particularly well the stabilising advantage of the present invention.Preparations made in this manner from a conjugate of alkaline phosphatase and anti beta HCG antibody have been found useful in the immunoassay of HCG based on a sandwich test technique using immunosorbent anti HCG well known per se . The dried preparation releases the conjugate that it contains into an aqueous assay reaction medium rapidly. for example within about a minute, on contact between the preparation and the liquid.We have found 85X retention of activity in storage trials lasting many weeks at 37 deg. C, in preparations of this kind.Further details are given in the following illustrative example. without limitation of the invention thereto. ExampleDried reagent preparations of enzyme antibody conjugate such as for example alkaline phosphatase and anti HCG both obtainable from commercial sources and coupled using standard glutaraldehyde technique can be made with good preservation of both enzymatic and antibody activity and quick releasability upon exposure to aqueous reaction liquid for example as follows.Carrier substrates are chosen for example Prom chemically clean borosilicate glass, polycarbonate plastics, polystyrene and nylon in the form of slides, strips, tubes and microtitre wells.Suitable proportions w v by way of example for ingredients in aqueous liquid to be used for drying down tc produce a dried preparation in accordance with embodiments of the invention are 10 sugar e.g. especially lactose or trehalose , 6 ovalbumin commercial reagent grade , 1 mM or other convenient concentration of magnesium chloride with 50mM tris.HCl pH 8, i.e. neutral or slightly alkaline , and any desired activity level of the enzyme conjugate such as alkalinephosphatase anti HCG to be dried down e.g. 1 100 microgram ml .In a preferred variation of these proportions, the quantity of ovalbumin is reduced to the range of about 1X to 3X w v, and the liquid composition also contains 1.5X w v polyethyleneglycol 6000 and 0.01X w v Triton QS9 TradeMark detergent.Aliquots of about 10 microlitre, per microtitre well or other carrier, of the above mentioned liquid composition, are applied to the respective carrier and the result airdried at 37 deg. C. The dried preparations are preferably maintained thereafter until required for reagent use within dry water impermeable enclosures, e.g. sealed plastics or metal foil packs. optionally including desiccant. It has been found after storage trials that such preparations maintain a satisfactory level and consistency of activity after several weeks storage even at temperatures as high as 37 deg. C, when used in conjunction with a per se known enzyme immunoassay technique using a nylon immunosorbent sensitised with anti HCG antibody, and a sandwich test technique resulting in a coloured product from a phosphatase substrate varying directly with the amount of HCG present in the sample to be assayed.In a modification of the above described example, further tests were carried out with dried preparations which were otherwise similar to those described above except that the conJugate was a conjugate prepared in known manner from alkaline phosphatase enzyme and pregnanediol. At elevated 37 deg. C storage temperatures, equivalent to tropical distribution and storage of clinical test reagent kits, the quantity of activity found after storage has been less after a week s storage than in cooler stored material kept at room temperature in temperate climate, but no further loss was encountered after several more weeks, and satisfactorily little extra variation in activity was found to have arisen after such storage in the unfavourable conditions. Many modifications and variations will be apparent to the skilled reader in the light of the foregoing descrtption, which is intended to extend to all combinations and subcombinations of features mentioned hereinabove and in the appended claims.
