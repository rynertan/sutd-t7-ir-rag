# Load lifting structure and hidden lifting chain assembly for lift truck mast.

## Abstract
A hidden lifting chain assembly in a lift truck multistage telescopic mast comprises a lifting chain 60 positioned in an elongate enclosure formed between two juxtaposed flanged uprights 14, 20 of adjacent telescopic mast sec tions. The chain 60 is connected to one upright 14 by a chain anchor 68 and extends longitudinally through the enclosure to a sheave 66 mounted on the other upright 20 The anchor 68 lies within the enclosure adjacent one end from which an anchor detachment bolt 68a is accessible after removing a guide roller 14a detachably secured by bolts 69 accessible externally. Thereby, despite the hidden location of the anchor 68 the chain 60 can be readily detached and removed for servicing or replacement while the mast is fully retracted without requiring disassembly of the mast sections. An anchor supporting block 67 provides a stop preventing hyperextension of the mast sections and is also detachably secured by bolts 67a accessible externally so as to permit removal and replacement at the same time as the anchor 68 .
