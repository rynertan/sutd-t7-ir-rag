## Description
The present invention relates to a vector capable of efficient gene expression that is useful in protein or polypeptide production using recombinant DNA technology, and utilization of such vector. More particularly, the present invention relates to a vector capable of efficient gene expression wherein a base sequence including a region having the transcription terminating function is linked immediately downstream from a base sequence encoding the translation termination of a structural gene coding for the protein or polypeptide to be produced. The invention also relates to a process for producing a protein or polypeptide using such a vector. Many attempts have been made to use the recombinant DNA technology in the production of a useful substance, particularly a physiologically active protein or polypeptide, in microorganisms, animal or plant cells, and th basic techniques for attaining this objective have been substantially established. At the same time, attempts have been made by many researchers toward efficient production of the desired substances. As for expression vectors, improvements and modifications have been made on the promoter region for accelerated transcription, the ribosome binding site Shine Dalgarno sequence for ensuring efficient translation of mRNA, as well as the base sequence of said ribosome binding site and the distance between said ribosome binding site and the translation initiation codon ATG . All of these efforts are directed to the 5 end non translational region present upstream from the structural gene to be expressed, and few studies have been made on the 3 end non translational region with a view to achieving efficient expression of an exogenous gene. It is already known that in eucaryotic cells, the non translational region downstream from at the 3 end of the codon for terminating the translation of a structural gene will improve the efficiency of the production of an exogenous protein or polypeptide Unexamined Published Japanese Patent Application Nos. 146281 1983 and 74986 1984 . However, no case exists where a specific study has been made of the 3 end non translational region which could affect the efficiency of the production of an exogenous protein or polypeptide using the recombinant DNA technology with procaryotic cells such as The present inventors postulated that not only in eucaryotic host cells but also in procaryotic cells such as The present invention is hereunder described with reference to the case of producing an exogenous polypeptide in The present inventors previously constructed an expression vector pIN5GIF54 for the chemically synthesized gene of hIFN γ composed of 146 amino acids said gene is hereunder abbreviated as GIF146 using an improved promoter of the gene coding for an In the pages that follow are described the construction of the vector of the present invention capable of efficient expression of the gene for human IFN γ as a useful substance, and utilization of such a vector. But it is believed that the concept of the present invention is equally applicable to the construction and utilization of vectors capable of efficient expression of other useful genes encoding, for example, human IFN α, human IFN β, α neoendorphin, carcitonin, growth hormones, interleukine 2, and a variety of immunity associated polypeptides. The genes GIF146 and GIF131 have the following amino acid sequences. Chemically synthesized genes that contain the base sequences encoding the above identified amino acid sequences and which are denoted by SUN GIF146 and SUN GIF131, respectively, have the following base sequences. Plasmid pIN5A2 was constructed by the procedures described below. This plasmid was such that, as shown in Fig. 1, a base sequence having the function of terminating the transcription of It has been reported that the TrpA terminator is an efficient ρ factor independent terminator Christie, G.E. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA, This fragment was used as a TrpA terminator. The plasmid pIN5GIF54 was a GIF146 producing plasmid having a lipoprotein promoter region lppP including an improved Shine Dargarno sequence in this plasmid, the terminator of tetracycline resistance gene Tc The present inventors cut pIN5GIF54 with SalI and AvaI and inserted into the cleavage site the TrpA terminator having SalI and AvaI sticky termini at the two ends, thereby constructing plasmid pIN5A2 having the TrpA terminator linked immediately downstream from the translation termination codon see Fig. 1 . Subsequently, As shown in Table 1, Plasmid pIN5T4 containing no TrpA terminator was constructed from pIN5GIF54 and pBR322. At the same time, plasmid pIN5T8 having the TrpA terminator linked immediately downstream from the codon for terminating the translation of the GIF146 structural gene was constructed from pIN5A2 see Fig. 1 and pBR322. The two plasmids, pIN5T4 and pIN5T8, differed only with respect to the presence of TrpA terminator, and both had tetracycline resistance Tc A photomicrograph of the protein bands obtained by SDS PAGE and strained with Coomassie blue is shown in Fig. 3. The present inventors continued their experimentation using plasmids having structures that differed slightly from those described above. As a result, the meritorious effects of inserting the TrpA terminator were verified, and at the same time, it was demonstrated that linking the TrpA terminator immediately downstream from the codon for the termination of the translation of the structural gene to be expressed was essential for the present invention. Three plasmids were constructed as shown below. The first one was plasmid pIN5T5 where that region of the ampicillin resistance gene Ap Three strains of Fig. 6 a is a photomicrograph of protein bands obtained by SDS PAGE and stained with Coomassie blue, and Fig. 6 b shows protein patterns obtained by gel scanning these bands. The band for ca. 18 kb corresponds to GIF146 protein. The data in Table 3 and Fig. 6 show the following The present inventors constructed two additional plasmids, pIN5T11 and pIN5T9, by the procedures shown in Fig. 7. The plasmid pIN5T11 was such that the TrpA terminator was linked immediately downstream from the termination codon of the GIF146 structural gene, and pIN5T9 was the plasmid harboring no TrpA terminator. These plasmids were introduced into two strains of Both pIN5T9 Fig. 7 and pIN5T5 were plasmids harboring no TrpA terminator. In pIN5T5, that region of Ap The present inventors also checked the effects of linking the TrpA terminator downstream from the translation termination codon in a vector for production of GIF131 where 15 amino acid residues were deleted from the C terminus of GIF146. By the procedures illustrated in Fig. 8, two plasmids, pIN5T5 131 and pIN5T13 131, were constructed, wherein the GIF146 structural gene portions present on pIN5T5 and pIN5T13 see Fig. 4 were replaced by the corresponding GIF131 structural gene portions. These plasmids were introduced into two strains of The plasmid pIN5GIF131 shown in Fig. 8 was so constructed as to ensure efficient production of GIF131 under the control of an improved promoter region of lipoprotein lpp gene. For details of the method of constructing this plasmid, see Japanese Patent Application No. 241457 1983. In order to further verify the effects of terminator insertion in GIF131 production, the present inventors constructed two more plasmids, pIN5T11 131 and pIN5T8 131, wherein the GIF146 structural gene portions on pIN5T11 see Fig. 7 and pIN5T8 see Fig. 2 , respectively, were replaced by GIF131 structural genes. After introducing these plasmids into two strains of As will be understood from the foregoing description, the insertion of a terminator in accordance with the present invention is very effective for the purpose of ensuring efficient production of an exogenous protein or polypeptide in a host microorganicsm, particularly The present invention will be described in greater detail with reference to the following example. Plasmid vector capable of efficient gene expression by virtue of insertion of a terminator Three micrograms of pIN5GIF54 see Japanese Patent Application No. 132524 1983 was completely digested with 15 units of SalI and 15 units of AvaI. The digested plasmid was subjected to agar gel electrophoresis and the larger DNA fragment was electro eluted from the gel by electrophoresis. DNA recovery was subsequently effected by precipitation with ethanol. A TrpA transcription terminator was designed for its base sequence, see Table 1 so that it had cohesive SalI and AvaI AGCC termini at the ends. This DNA fragment was synthesized by a DNA synthesizer, Model 380 A of Applied Biosystems, and elimination of protective groups and purification were performed by routine techniques. The purified DNA fragment was phosphated at 5 terminus with ATP and polynucleotide kinase. A portion 0.2 µg of the phosphated DNA fragment was mixed with the previously obtained SalI AvaI fragment of pIN5GIF54 and the mixture was subjected to ligation at 15 C for 18 hours in a ligation solution 20 µl composed of 20 mM tris HCl pH, 7.4 , 10 mM MgCl₂, 10 mM DTT dithiothreitol , and 1 mM ATP. After treatment with 0.3 mL CaCI₂, The transformant was shake cultured at 30 C for 24 hours in 1.5 ml of a GC medium in a 16.5 mm test tube the medium contained 40 µg ml of ampicillin and had the following composition 2 glycerol, 3 Casamino acids, 0.2 yeast extract, 0.5 KH₂PO₄ and 0.1 MgSO₄ 7H₂O, and pH adjusted to 6.5 with NaOH. After completion of the cultivation OD₆₆₀ 7 , 0.5 ml of the culture solution was put into a 1.5 ml Eppendorf cup and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 minutes. The collected cells were suspended in 0.5 ml of PBS solution 0.8 NaCl, 0.02 KCl, 0.115 sodium monohydrogenphosphate, and 0.02 potassium dihydrogenphosphate containing 1 mg ml of lysozyme and 1 mM EDTA. After reaction at 0 C for 30 minutes, the cells were disrupted by three freeze thaw cycles. The supernatant fraction was recovered by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 minutes and checked for antiviral activity by the method shown in Unexamined Published Japanese Patent Application No. 201995 1983. Another 0.5 ml portion of the culture solution was centrifuged for 5 minutes at 10,000 rpm. The collected cells were dissolved in 200 µl of SDS sample solution 10 mM phosphate buffer with pH 7.2, 7 M urea, 1 SDS, and 1 2 mercaptoethanol and the resulting solution was heated on a boiling water bath for 10 minutes. A portion 20 µl of the sample was separated into fractions by 13 SDS PAGE and the protein was stained with Coomassie blue. The protein bands were subjected to gel scanning at 580 nm to calculate the proportion of GIF146 to the total protein. GIF146 produced a band at ca. 18 kd, but the untransformed W3110 would produce the same band in an amount of ca. 3 , so this value was subtracted from the observed value of GIF146 protein relative to the total protein. The results of the measurements of antiviral activity and GIF146 production are shown in Table 1, from which one can see that pIN5A2 having the TrpA terminator inserted immediately downstream from the GIF146 gene had antiviral activity and GIF146 productivity values which are respectively about 2 and 1.7 times as high as the values exhibited by pIN5GIF54. A portion 5 µg of pIN5GIF54 was completely digested with 20 units of AatII and 20 units of SalI. The cohesive AatII end 3 terminus and SalI end 5 terminus were made blunt using T4 DNA polymerase and 4dNTP including dATP, dGTP, dCTP and TTP the AatII end was subjected to trimming whereas the SalI end was subjected to filling in.

A portion 5 µg of pBR322 was completely digested with 20 units of EcoRI and the resulting sticky end was made blunt by the filling in technique described above. The plasmid was then digested completely with 20 units of AhaIII.

The two DNA fragments were mixed, ligated and treated by the method described above to obtain pIN5T4 see Fig. 2 . A portion 5 µg of pIN5A2 was completely digested with 20 units of AatII and 20 units of AvaI, and the resulting cohesive ends were made blunt by the trimming and filling in techniques described above.

Two strains of Two plasmids, pIN5T5 and pIN5T9 to be described later , were first prepared. By inserting the TrpA terminator into pIN5T5, pIN5T13 and pIN5T15 were constructed, and by inserting the same terminator into pIN5T9, pIN5T11 to be described later was constructed. Starting from pIN5GIF54, a blunt ended AatII SalI DNA fragment ca. 750 bp containing lppP lpp promoter and GIF gene was obtained by the method described in 2.

The two DNA fragments were mixed together and ligated to construct pIN5T5 see Fig. 4 . The pBR322 derived PstI EcoRI DNA fragment 3.6 kb with flush ends was mixed with a pIN5A2 derived flush ended AatII AvaI 0.8 kb DNA fragment obtained by the same method as described in 2, and the mixture was ligated and treated by the method described above to obtain pIN5T13.

A portion 5 µg of pBR322 was cut with 20 units of EcoRI and the resulting cohesive end was filled in with T4 DNA polymerase using the method described above. Thereafter, the plasmid was cut with 20 units of AhaIII and treated by the method described above to obtain a DNA fragment 3.2 kb containing the tetracycline resistance gene. This DNA fragment was mixed with a pIN5A2 derived flush ended AatII AvaI 0.8 kb DNA fragment that was obtained from 5 µg of digested pIN5A2 by the method described above. The mixture was ligated and treated by the method described above to obtain pIN5T7. A portion 5 µg of pIN5T7 was digested with 30 units of SalI and the resulting cohesive end was filled in by the same method as described above.

Three strains of In pIN5T5, the 3 terminal end of GIF146 gene was located at the PstI site of β lactamase gene on pBR322. In this section, the results of experiment with a plasmid where the 3 terminal end of GIF146 gene was located at the BglI site of β lactamse gene are described. Fig. 7 shows the procedures for preparing pIN5T9 and pIN5T11 having the TrpA terminator inserted immediately downstream from the GIF146 gene in pIN5T9 . A portion 5 µg of pIN5GIF54 was digested with 20 units of AatII and 20 units of SalI and the resulting cohesive ends were made blunt by the method described above. Thereafter, a DNA fragment containing the GIF146 gene was separated. A portion 5 µg of pBR322 was cut with 20 units of BglI and the resulting sticky end was made blunt.

Two strains of In this section are reviewed the effects of terminator insertion on the expression of GIF131 gene as described in Japanese Patent Application No. 241457 1983, where 15 amino acid residues were deleted from C terminus . Fig. 8 shows the sequence of steps for preparing pIN5T5 131 and pIN5T13 131. A portion 5 µg of pBR322 was cut with 10 units of PstI, made blunt ended by the method described above, and ligated with 0.5 µg of SalI linker, whereby pT12 having SalI inserted into the PstI cleavage site was obtained. A portion 5 µg of pT12 was completely digested with 20 units of EcoRI, made blunt ended by the method described above, partially digested with 1 unit of SalI and subsequently treated by the method described above to obtain a DNA fragment containing the tetracycline resistance gene. A portion 5 µg of pIN5GIF131 described in Japanese Patent Application No. 241457 1983 was digested with 20 units of AatII, made blunt ended by the method described above, digested with 20 units of SalI and subsequently treated by the method described above to obtain a DNA fragment containing the GIF131 gene. The two DNA fragments were mixed together and ligated to obtain pIN5T5 131. A portion 5 µg of the pIN5T5 131 was digested with 40 units of SalI and subsequently treated by the method described so as to obtain a DNA fragment containing the GIF131 gene and part of the tetracycline resistance gene. A portion 5 µg of pIN5T13 see Fig. 4 was digested with 40 units of SalI and subsequently treated by the method described above to obtain a DNA fragment containing part of the tetracycline resistance gene, the TrpA terminator and the replication initiation point. The two DNA fragments were mixed and ligated to obtain pIN5T13 131. This plasmid was identical to pIN5T5 131 except that the TrpA terminator was inserted immediately downstream from the GIF131 gene. Fig. 9 shows the sequence of steps for preparing pIN5T8 131 and pIN5T11 131, both of which had the TrpA terminator inserted immediately downstream from the GIF131 gene. Two plasmids, pIN5T11 see Fig. 7 and pIN5T5 131, each weighing 5 µg were digested with 40 units of SalI. From the pIN5T11, a DNA fragment containing part of the tetracycline resistance gene, the TrpA terminator and the replication initiation point was obtained by the method described above. From the pIN5T5 131, a DNA fragment containing the GIF131 gene and part of the tetracycline resistance gene was obtained by the method described above. These two DNA fragements were mixed and ligated to obtain pIN5T11 131. A portion 5 µg of pIN5T5 131 was digested with 20 units of EcoRI and 20 units of SalI, and subsequently treated by the method described above to obtain a DNA fragment containing the GIF131 gene. A portion 5 µg of pIN5T8 was completely digested with 20 units of EcoRI, partially digested with 1 unit of SalI, and subsequently treated by the method described above to obtain a DNA fragment containing the tetracycline resistance gene, TrpA terminator, lpp promoter and the replication initiation point. The two DNA fragments were mixed and ligated to obtain pIN5T8 131. Strains of These results show that pIN5T13 131 having the TrpA terminator inserted immediately downstream from the GIF131 to be expressed had a higher GIF131 productivity than pIN5T5 131 having no TrpA terminator insert. Table 5 lists the antiviral activity values for the GIF131 producing plasmids and the results of gel scanning of the protein bands obtained by SDS PAGE and stained with Coomassie blue. The plasmid pIN5T13 131 obviously exhibited the effects of terminator insertion because its antiviral activity and GIF131 productivity were 4 and 2.5 times as high as the values for pIN5T5 131, respectively. Results similar to those obtained by pIN5T13 131 were attained by pIN5T8 131 where the expression unit i.e., the DNA fragment having the lpp promoter, GIF131 gene and the TrpA terminator linked together was inserted in the opposite direction as compared with pIN5T13 131, and by pIN5T11 131 wherein the same expression unit was inserted in a position different from that adopted in pIN5T13 131.
