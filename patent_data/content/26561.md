# Nephritogenic compounds containing a biologically active sugar moiety, methods of preparing them and their applications.

## Abstract
A novel nephrotogenic compound has a biologically active sugar moiety of structural formula CHEM The compound may be a glycopeptide which contains a peptide moiety linking to the sugar moiety through the N glycoside bond. The glycopeptide may be isolated from the organs of normal animals, especially the kidneys, or from the urine of healthy human beings, and is biological active to induce kidney lesions in animals. The lesions induced by an injection of the glycopeptide are very similar to the spectrum of human glomerulonephritis, and so the injected animals provide an experimental model for studies on human glomerulonephritis.
