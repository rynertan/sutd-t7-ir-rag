In many cases5 the reaction isgenerally carried out under cooling or at room temperature.The reaction is complete in several minutes to several tens of flours. The thus produced compound 11 can be isolated and purified by per se known procedures, such as concentration, pH adjustment, solvent extraction, crystallization, recrystallization, fractional distillation and or chromatography. In cases where the starting compound III or a salt or silyl derivative thereof and or the acylating agent contains an asynmetric carbon atcm in the molecule thereof, either each single stereoisomer or a mixture of stereoisomers may be subjected to the above acylation reaction. Furthermore, when the product is a mixture of stereoisomers, each individual stereoisomer can be isolated by the conventional method, for instance by column chromatography or recrystallization, as necessary. In cases where the products LI , I thus obtained by sulfonation or acylation have a protective group, the produet carl be subjected to deprotection reaction, followed by purification as necessary, whereby the desired compounds LI , are obtained. The deprotection method is selected from among per se known methodsvsuch as the method involving the use of an acid, one using a base, a reductive method, the method involving the use of hydrazine, and the method involving the use of thiourea or sodium N methyldithiocarbamate.The method involving the use of an acid employs, such as an inorganic acid e.g. hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid etc. , an organic acid e.g. formic acid, acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, propionic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, p toluenesulfonic acid, etc. and acid ion exchange resins and so on. The method involving the use of a base employs, such as an inorganic base such as the hydroxides or carbonates of alkali metals e.g. sodium, potassium, etc. or of alkaline earth metals e.g. calcium, magnesium, etc. , an organic base such as metal alkoxides, organic amines, quartenary ammonium salts, and basic ion exchange resins, etc. When the above methdd involving the use of an acid or a base is carried out in the presence of a solvent, the solvent is usually a hydrophilic organic solvent, water or a mixed solvent. The reductive method employs, according to the type of protective group and other conditions, a metal e.g.tin, zinc, etc. or a metal compound e.g. chromous chloride, chromous acetate, etc. together with an acid such as an organic or inorganic acid e.g. acetic acid, propionic acid, hydrochloric acid , or involves the use of a metal catalyst for catalytic reduction. The catalyst used for such catalytic reduction may for example be platinum catalysts e.g. platinum wire, platinum sponge, platinum black, platinum oxide, colloidal platinum, etc. , palladium catalysts e.g. palladium sponge, palladium black, palladium oxide, palladium barium sulfate, palladium barium carbonate, palladium carbon, palladium silica gel, colloidal palladium, etc. , reduced nickel, nickel oxide, Raney nickel, andUrushihara nickel, etc. The reductive method involving the use of a metal and an acid employs a metal compound e.g. of iron or chromium and an inorganic acid e.g. hydrochloric acid or organic acid e.g. formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, etc. . The reductive method is usually conducted in a solvent. In the catalytic reduction method, for instance, the reaction is conducted usually in the presence of an alcohol e.g. methanol, ethanol, propyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, etc. , ethyl acetate, etc. The method involving the use of a metal and an acid is usually carried out in the presence of water, acetone or the like, but when the acid is liquid, it may be utilized as the solvent as well. The reaction is usually conducted in the range of from cooling to warming. The compound which is protective group free is isoalted, in the free form or if necessary after conversion to a salt form, by column chromatography and or recrystallization, for instance. The starting compound LII and LIII which are used in the present invention are novel compounds and can be produced, for instance, according to the method disclosed in European laid open patent appln.
