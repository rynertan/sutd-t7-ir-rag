## Abstract
The negative rail of a CMOS memory and its backup bat tery are coupled to the main PSU negative rail of the overall sys tem via a normally on transistor. If the main PSU starts to fail, the transistor turns off the positive terminal of the battery is coupled to the system positive rail, so as this falls in voltage to wards the system negative rail, the negative rail of the CMOS memory is taken several volts negative of the system negative rail. Thus any write enable signal at system negative potential spuriously applied to the memory as the PSU fails appears sev eral volts positive of the memory negative rail and cannot en able the memory.
