# Vibratory device, dental or surgical instrument, and depth stop and attachment assembly therefor.

## Abstract
A vibratory endodontic device includes a housing 12 , a vibratory drive means 42 supported within the housing to minimise the transfer of vibration to the housing, an endodontic file 207 connected to the drive means for vibratory movement and stop means 214 operatively connected to the housing and substantially isolated from mechanical vibrations created by the vibratory drive means. Additionally, fluid transport means 221 is provided for maintaining a controllable or a continuous flow or irrigation fluid along the endodontic file. Various assemblies for retaining the endodontic files and the stop means at the operative end of the vibrating device are also described. The vibratory drive means and supports are arranged to generate an oscillatory motion which is translated to the file as simultaneous perpendicular and parallel vibrations relative to the longitudinal axis of the vibratory drive means.
