## Description
The present invention relates to a novel method for the treatment and promotion of healing of bone fractures and osteotomies in warm blooded animals including humans, by the local application of 24,25 dihydroxy cholecalciferol 24,25 dihydroxy vitamin D₃, hereinafter 24,25 OH ₂D₃ . The invention further relates to novel compositions comprising 24,25 OH ₂D₃ adapted for the local application to the sites of bone fractures or osteotomies in accordance with the method of the inven tion. Vitamin D₃, cholecalciferol, has been long known to be associated with bone formation. Several publications provided evidence that 24,25 dihydroxycholecalciferol 24,25 OH ₂D₃ is the active metabolite in this process. Bordier, P.A. et al., J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. It has now been surprisingly found in accordance with the present invention that local administration of 24,25 OH ₂D₃ to the site of bone fractures or osteo tomies in warm blooded animals including humans, unex pectedly results in an excellent healing effect of said fractures or osteotomies, the effect being considerably superior to those obtained by hitherto conventional treatments. It has further been found that this benefi cial effect on fracture healing is practically unique to 24,25 OH ₂D₃ and is not, or only insignificantly, exhi bited by other vitamin D₃ metabolites, in particular 1α, 25 dihydroxy vitamin D₃ hereinafter 1,25 OH ₂D₃ . The invention thus provides, in accordance with one aspect thereof, a method for the treatment and promotion of healing of bone fractures and osteotomies in warm blooded animals including humans, which comprises local application to the site of the fracture or osteotomy of a therapeutically effective amount of 24,25 OH ₂D₃ dis solved or dispersed in a suitable physiologically compa tible carrier. Local administration of 24,25 OH ₂D₃ to the sites of bone fractures or osteotomies, can be effected either by injection of the active metabolite in a suitable solvent preferably an oily solvent, e.g. arachis oil to the cartilage growth plate or, in cases of open surgery, by local application thereto of the active vitamin D₃ metabolite dissolved or dispersed in a suit able solvent or any other vehicle or carrier selected from those suitable for use in orthopedic surgery, such as bone wax, demineralized bone powder, polymeric bone cements, bone sealants and the like. Alternatively, local application can be achieved by applying a solution or dispersion of the active metabolite in a suitable vehicle onto the surface of, or incorporating it into solid or semi solid implants conventionally used in orthopedic surgery, such as dacron mesh, gel foam and kiel bone, or prostheses. In accordance with a further aspect, the invention provides compositions adapted for use in the method of the invention, comprising from 0.002 to 0.2 by weight of 24,25 OH ₂D₃ in combination with a physiologically compatible vehicle as hereinafter defined suitable for use in orthopedic surgery for local application to a site of bone fracture or osteotomy, or for application to solid or semi solid implants conventional in orthope dic surgery and to prostheses. Preferably the compositions according to this as pect of the invention comprise from 0.005 to 0.05 by weight of 24,25 OH ₂D₃. The terms vehicle or carrier as used herein are meant to refer to any liquid, semi solid or solid mater ials, either synthetic or of animal origin, which are conventionally used in orthopedic surgery. Suitable vehicles or carriers for use in the com positions according to the invention include bone wax, demineralized bone powder, polymeric bone cements and various conventional bone sealants, e.g. Absele Trade Mark . As stated above, 24,25 OH ₂D₃ can also be ap plied, according to the invention, to the surface of prostheses or solid or semi solid orthopedic implants or incorporated therein, e.g. by absorption in such im plants which have a porous structure, e.g. dacron mesh, the so called gel foam, kiel bone and the like. In accordance with the present invention it has first been found that local administration of 24,25 OH ₂D₃ In the light of the above findings, another set of experiments was designed in order to demonstrate the effect of locally administered 24,25 OH ₂D₃ in facili tating fracture healing. Experimental fractures were made in the mid shaft of the tibiae of vitamin D defici ent chicks and a composition comprising 0.1 by weight of 24,25 OH ₂D₃ in bone wax was implanted at the frac ture site. A control group of chicks were treated in the same manner except that at the fracture site there was implanted bone wax without the active vitamin D₃ metabo lite. A number of birds of both groups were killed 9 and 12 days after the fracture, calcium level in the plasma was determined and the calluses formed at the fractured tibiae were examined histologically. Both groups of chicks were found to be hypocalcaemic, indicating that the vitamin D₃ metabolite implanted at the fracture site did not enter the blood stream. It could be observed already macroscopically that the calluses formed after 9 and 12 days in the 24,25 OH ₂D₃ treated chicks were considerably larger as compared to the control group, and after 12 days the two edges of the bones at the site of the fracture in the treated group were significantly less mobile than in the control fractures. Histological examination of the calluses revealed three major differences between the control and the treated chicks A similar set of experiments was carried out on normal, vitamin D supplemented chicks. The experimental protocol was identical to the one used with the vitamin D deficient birds and similar results were observed. The process of fracture healing which is in prin ciple a process of endochondral bone formation, involves the participation of various types of cells. The initial process in bone formation is the proliferation of the cartilage cells chondroblasts . A distinct solid, ex tracellular matrix is being formed and the cells become hypertrophic. Mineralization appears in the extracellu lar matrix and thereafter the mineralized cartilage is resorbed by chondroclasts and mesenchymal and osteoblast cells appear and deposit new bone. 24,25 OH ₂D₃ was shown to affect the maturation, differentiation and function of cartilage cells Corvol, M.T. et al., Endocrinology 24,25 OH ₂D₃ was shown in accordance with the present invention to affect the maturation and differen tiation of cartilage cells, namely, the initial stages in the process of bone formation. However, several other factors that are known to affect cells participating in the later stages of said process could be advantageously used in order to further shorten the time required for fracture healing. Thus, local application of 1α OH D₃to and or 1,25 OH ₂D₃ in combination with 24,25 OH ₂D₃ at the fracture site could result, not only in faster maturation of cartilage cells, but also in more rapid formation of bone due to an additional effect of 1,25 OH ₂D₃ on osteoblast activity of these cells. Addi tional substances which may facilitate fracture healing if applied locally together with 24,25 OH ₂D₃ at the fracture site include estradiol, hydroxyapatite crystals, fluoroapatite crystals and growth hormone. All these factors are known to stimulate and facilitate fracture healing and bone formation. Thus, the invention also contemplates within its scope a method for the treatment and promotion of heal ing of bone fractures and osteotomies in warm blooded animals including humans, which comprise local applica tion to the site of the fracture or osteotomy of 24,25 OH ₂D₃ in a suitable carrier in combination with one or more auxiliary substances selected from 1α OH D₃, 1,25 OH ₂D₃, estradiol, hydroxyapatite crystals, fluoro apatite crystals and growth hormone. In its other aspect, the invention extends to com positions comprising from 0.002 to 0.2 by weight of 24,25 OH ₂D₃ in combination with a therapeutically effective amount of one or more of the above listed auxiliary substances. The invention will now be illustrated by the fol lowing non limiting examples and with reference to the accompanying drawings in which 2.5 g of bone wax were heated on a water bath to 55 Cand to the melt there was added a solution of 250 µg of 24,25 OH ₂D₃ in 0.5 ml of ethanol. The mixture was stirred at about 55 C for several seconds and immediate ly cooled in an ice bath. A sample of the mixture obtained above was extrac ted with chloroform methanol, the extract was evaporated to dryness and the lipid residue submitted to HPLC analysis. The resulting graph was compared with that obtained from the chloroform methanol extract of the same bone wax which did not contain the vitamin D₃d metabolite. The only difference between the curves was an additional peak which appeared in the curve obtained from the first mentioned sample which peak was identi fied as the 24,25 OH ₂D₃ peak. This proved that the vitamin D₃ metabolite did not undergo any chemical change in the course of the above described procedure. 2 mg of 24,25 OH ₂D₃ were dissolved in 10 ml of the liquid monomeric component of bone cement. In use, the desired amount of the obtained solution is admixed with prescribed amount of the polymeric component powder of the cement, the mixture applied to the fracture site and allowed to set. A solution of 200 µg of 24,25 OH ₂D₃ in 1 ml of ethanol was intimately admixed with 2 g of a convention al absorbable bone sealant main components ox fibrin, ox collagen, dextran, glycerol, water by kneading in a glass mortar at room temperature. 500 µg of 24,25 OH ₂D₃ were dissolved in 3 ml of ethanol and the solution intimately admixed with colla gen bone powder. The ethanol solvent was then evaporated under reduced pressure at room temperature. One day old male chicks Gallus domesticus were depleted of vitamin D by feeding them a vitamin D deficient diet for 4 weeks. They were then divided into four groups and injected directly into the proximal epiphysis of the tibia, every 3 days, with one of the following The oily solutions containing the vitamin D₃ meta bolites were injected into the right tibia and the vehicle arachis oil only into the left tibia. Two aditional groups of chicks were studied and served as non treated controls a group of rachitic birds and a group of vitamin D₃ supplemented birds. Following a course of three intraephiphyseal injec tions the chicks were killed and plasma was prepared for the determination of calcium and of vitamin D₃ metabo lites. The proximal epiphyses of the tibiae were re moved, fixed in 10 neutral formaldehyde, then dehy drated, and embedded in glycol methacrylate. Non decal cified, 3 µm thick longitudinal sections were stained with toluidine blue or von Kossa stain and examined by light microscopy. The results are summarized in the following Table I. As shown in Table I, the vitamin D deficient chicks that were injected intraepiphyseally with 1,25 OH ₂D₃ or with 24,25 OH ₂D₃ retained low plasma concentrations of calcium, similar to untreated vitamin D deficient birds. None of the hydroxylated vitamine D₃ metabolites could be detected in the plasma of these chicks, indicating that the injected metabolite did not enter the blood stream. However, the chicks that were injected intraepi physeally with 25 OH D₃ showed normal plasma concentra tion of calcium and detectable levels of the hydroxy lated metabolites, although significantly lower than the levels measured in the vitamin D supplemented group. The upper tibial epiphyses in all birds were still cartilaginous consisting of reserve, proliferative and hypertrophic zones. In the controls D the different zones were well defined. Vitamin D deficient chicks revealed typical signs of rickets, i.e. elongated pro liferative and hypertrophic zones, wide osteoid seams with little mineralization of cartilage. However, it was difficult to clearly differentiate between the prolifer ative and hypertrophic zones and the measurements are related to total epiphyseal length only rather than to individual zones see Table I . The results prove that injection of 1,25 OH ₂D₃ did not reduce the severity of the rickets, whereas injec tion of 24,25 OH ₂D₃ caused almost complete recovery of the right tibia, while the left tibia still showed typical rachitic changes except for a slight reduction in total epiphyseal length. Injection of 25 OH D₃ was followed by recovery from rickets in both right and left tibiae although the recovery was more pronounced in the right tibia, the injected one. Furthermore, treatment with all metabolites resulted in a significant increase in the number of osteoclasts as compared to D chicks. This was most prominent following 1,25 OH ₂D₃ treatment. One day old male chicks Gallus domesticus were depleted of vitamin D by feeding them a vitamin D deficient diet for four weeks. Experimental fractures were performed under general anasthesia with continuous inhalation of Halotane. A skin incision was made under sterile conditions, the tibia was exposed and a trans versal hole was drilled with the aid of a dental burr. Light pressure with the fingers caused transversal frac ture of the bone. About 50 mg of bone wax containing 5 µg of 24,25 OH ₂D₃, prepared as described in Example 1 herein, was implanted at the fracture site on both edges of the fractures tibia. After 9 and 12 days some of the chicks were killed, plasma was prepared for calcium determination and the calluses of the fractured tibiae were removed, fixed in 10 neutral formaldehyde and prepared routinely for light microscopy. Decalcified preparations were made for Hematoxilyn and Eosin H E staining and undecalcified preparations were made for von Kossa stain. A control group of chicks were treated in the same manner except that 50 mg of bone wax which did not contain any 24,25 OH ₂D₃ was implanted at the fracture site. Both groups of chicks were hypocalcemic, indicating that the vitamin D₃ metabolite implanted at the fracture site did not enter the blood stream. The calluses formed after 9 and 12 days revealed macroscopically the forma tion of a larger callus at the fracture sites where 24,25 OH ₂D₃ in bone wax was implanted as compared to the control group. On the 12th day after the fracture it was further observed in the treated group that the two edges of the bones at the fracture site were signifi cantly less mobile than in the control group. The histological findings are illustrated in Figs. 1 to 18 of the accompanying drawings in which the fol lowing can be seen A similar set of experiments was carried out with two groups of normal, vitamin D supplemented chicks, namely a control group and a group treated with the usual 24,25 OH ₂D₃ in accordance with the above des cribed experimental procedure. The results were similar to those observed in the experiments with the vitamin D deficient chicks, as described above. One day old male chicks were depleted of Vitamin D by feeding them a Vitamin D deficient diet and by pre venting their exposure to ultraviolet light. From day three the birds were treated, every 5 days, by injec tions of 1.8 µg of cholecalciferol for the entire exper imental period. Experimental fractures were performed under local anaesthesia with 1 lidocaine. A skin incision was made under sterile conditions, the tibia was exposed and a tranverse hole was drilled therethrough with the aid of a dental burr. Light pressure with the fingers caused transversal fracture of the bone. The chicks were di vided into 4 groups. In the first group 50 mg of Bone wax containing 5 µg of 24,25 OH ₂D₃ was implanted at the fracture site on both edges of the fractured tibia. In the second group 5 µg of 1α25 OH ₂D₃ were used, while in the third group a combination of 5 µg of 1α25 OH ₂D₃the and 5 µg of 24,25 OH ₂D₃ was implanted. The fourth group was implanted with a plain bone wax and served as a control. The chicks were sacrificed 7 days after the above operation. The fractured tibiae were removed and cleaned. Care was taken not to damage the callus, and the ends were potted in a quick setting polyester resin. Each bone specimen with its molded ends was subjected to torsional deformation using a Universal Testing Instru ment, Model 1126 Instron, England . The machine was suited for torsion testing and the rate of deformation produced was 180 degrees min. The strength characteris tics of each bone were analysed from the torque angle graph obtained from each bone specimen. Four parameters are readily measured from each graph Fig. 19 1. Maximum torque 2. Angle 3. Initial stiffness and 4. Stiffness. The mechanical properties of the calluses are rep resented in the following Table 2 after 7 days of fracture healing . The strength of the callus was lower than the normal unbroken tibia. This is as pre dicted for a 7 days formation of new bone. 24,25 OH ₂D₃ increased significantly the strength of the callus expressed in maximum torque and the initial stiffness, as compared with the other groups, especially the 1,25 OH ₂D₃ treated group. The elastic property of the callus is obtained by the cartilaginous tissue. The increased angle of the 24,25 OH ₂D₃ treated group is compatible with the mor phological changes which occurred in the callus see Example 6 . A similar set of experiments was carried out, ex cept that the chicks were sacrificed 14 days after the implantation with the bone wax, i.e. after 14 days of healing. No relevant mechanical data in respect of the callus could, however, be obtained because in three out of the four treated groups it was surprisingly found that, upon testing, the bone broke not at the original fracture site but rather in different places, indicating that the healed fracture site was stronger than the remaining sections of the bone. The exception was the control group, wherein about 50 of the specimens broke at the original fracture site, whereas the remaining 50 broke at other portions of the specimen. The obvious conclusion is that in the three groups treated with the vitamin D₃ derivatives the callus was about twice as strong as in the control group. In the last mentioned series of experiments it is also relevant to note that only the birds of the control group still showed considerable limping after 14 days of healing. After 10 days 3 injections with 3 days intervals in the intraepiphyseal injection model and 7 days in the callus forming model, the chicks were killed. The epiphyseal growth plates and the calluses were dissect ed, weighed and homogenized with the aid of a Polytron homogenizer in ice cold 0.15M NaCl containing 3 mM of NaHCO₃ pH 7.4 , and centrifuged at 20,000 x g for 15 min. at 4 C. The supernatants were assayed for alkaline phosphotase in 0.1M Sodium Barbital buffer, pH 9.3 with p nitrophenyl phosphate purchased from Sigma as a substrate. Protein was determined in the enzyme ex tracts by the Lowry method, and the results were ex pressed as units per mg protein. One unit of phosphatase is defined as the enzyme activity that liberated 1 µmol of p nitrophenol per 0.5h at 37 C. As shown in the following Tables 3 and 4 there is a marked reduction in the AP activity after local adminis tration of 24,25 OH ₂D₃. The decreased activity of this enzyme correlates well with our findings Table 5 below when we deter mined AP activity in the epiphyses and diaphyses of normal chicks in comparison with rachitic birds as well as with the published data in references 3,4 . Shedden showed a loss of alkaline phosphatase activity close to a fracture site. This diminution of activity was not caused by the death of the cells in this region, close to the fracture, because a similar result was found in the periosteal cells in subperiosteal fractures in which the periosteum was intact . The features disclosed in the foregoing description, in the claims and or in the accompanying drawings may, both separately and in any combination thereof, be material for realising the invention in diverse forms thereof.
