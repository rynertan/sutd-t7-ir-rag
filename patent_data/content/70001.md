## Description
TITLE Polyamide Blends FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to polyamide blends, and more particularly to blends of at least one amorphous copolyamide and at least one semicrystalline polyamide. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The properties of thermoplastic semicrystalline polyamide molding resins may be altered by addition of various additives to the resins, such as fillers or reinforcing agents, flame retardants, stabilizers and the like. On the other hand, certain amorphous copolyamides can be molded to produce transparent molded articles. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In this invention, it has been discovered that particular amorphous thermoplastic copolyamides can be combined with semicrystalline thermoplastic polyamides to produce molding blends having a variety of applications depending on the relative amounts of the amorphous polyamide and the semi crystalline polyamide present. In its broadest aspect, this invention is a blend of thermoplastic polyamide molding resins comprising a about 5 98 percent by weight of a thermoplastic semicrystalline polyamide of film forming molecular weight, and complementally, b about 95 2 percent by weight of a teroplastic amorphous copolyamide consisting essentially of i 40 98 mole percent units of isphthalic acid based on total acids present, ii 2 60 mole percent units of terephthalic acid based on total acids present, iii 50 98 mole percent units of hexamethylene diamine based on total amines present and iv 2 50 mole percent units, based on total amines present, of at least one aliphatic diamine containing between 8 and 20 carbon atoms and containing at least one cyclohexane moiety, wherein in the amorphous copolyamide the mole percent phthalic acids present totals 100 percent and the mole percent diamines present totals 100 percent, and wherein up to 40 weight percent of the amorphous copolyamide may consist of units of a lactam, or an aminoacid of 4 12 carbon atoms, or units derived from a 4 12 carbon atom aliphatic dicarboxylic acid and a 2 12 carbon atom aliphatic diamine. In one preferred aspect of the invention, the semicrystalline polyamide will be present in an amount of about 5 to about 40 percent to impart solvent resistance to transparent articles molded from the blend. In another preferred aspect of the invention, the semicrystalline polyamide will comprise about 40 to about 98 percent and the amorphous copolyamide will be present in an amount of between about 2 and 60 percent to improve resistance to attack by zinc chloride, and reduce debilitating effects of moisture on articles molded from the semicrystalline polyamides. The term thermoplastic semicrystalline polyami√èe means that the polyamide has a distinct melting point with a measurable heat of fusion as described below. Amorphous copolyamides will generally have no distinct melting point nor measurable heat of fusion although with very slow cooling from the melt or sufficient annealing some crystallinity may develop. The heat of fusion is conveniently determined by use of a differential scanning calorimeter DSC . A suitable calorimeter is The Du Pont Company s 990 thermal analyzer PartNumber 990000 with cell base II, Part Number 990315, and DSC cell, Part Number 900600. With this instrument, heat of fusion can be measured at a heating rate of 200C per minute. The sample is alternately heated to a temperature above the anticipated melting point and cooled rapidly by cooling the sample jacket with liquid nitrogen.The heat of fusion is determined on any heating cycle after the first and should be a constant value, within experimental error. Amorphous polyamides are defined herein as having a heat of fusion, by this method, of less than 1 cal gm. Semicrystalline polyamides are defined herein as having a heat of fusion of more than 1 cal gm. For reference, semicrystalline 66 nylon polyamide with a molecular weight of about 17,000 has a heat of fusion of about 16 cal gm. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The semicrystalline polyamides are well known in the art. They have molecular weights over 10000 and can be produced by condensation of equimolar amounts of a saturated aliphatic dicarboxylic acid containing from 4 12 carbon atoms with an aliphatic diamine containing 2 12 carbon atoms, in which the diamine can be employed, if desired, to provide an excess of amine end groups over carboxy end groups in the polyamide. Vice versa, the diacid can be used to provide an excess of acid groups. Equally well, these polyamides may be made from acid forming and amine forming derivatives of said acids and amines such as esters, acid chlorides, amine salts, etc.Representative aliphatic dicarboxylic acids used to make the polyamides include adipic acid, pimelic acid, azelaic acid, suberic acid, sebacic acid, and dodecanedioic acid, while representative aliphatic diamines include hexamethylenediamine and octamethylenediamine. In addition, these polyamides can also be prepared from self condensation of a lactam. Examples of polyamides include polyhexamethylene adipamide 66 nylon , polyhexamethylene azelamide 69 nylon , polyhexamethylene sebacamide 610 nylon , and polyhexamethylene dodecanoamide 612 nylon , poly bis p aminocyclohexyl methane dodecanoamide, or polya nides produced by ring opening of lactams i.e., polyzaprolactam 6 nylon , and polylauryl lactam.It is also possible to use polyamides prepared by the polymerization of at least two of the amines or acids used to prepare the above polymers, as for example, a polymer made of adipic acid, and sebacic acid and hexamethylene diamine. Blends of polaides, such as a mixture of 66 nylon and 6 nylon are also included as are copolymer such as nylon 66 6. Preferably the condensation polyaie employed herein is polyhexamethylene adipamide 66 nylon , or a blend of polyhexamethylene adipamide 66 nylon and polycaprolactam 6 nylon . The amorphous copolyamide preferably comprises 60 90 mole percent units of isophthalic acid, 10 40 mole percent units of terephthalic acid, 80 98 mole percent units of hexamethylene diamine, and 2 20 mole percent units of at least one aliphatic diamine containing between 8 and 20 carbon atoms and containing at least one cyclohexane moiety. The amorphous copolyamides exhibit melt viscosities at 2800C of less than 30,000 poise, and preferably less than 20,000 poise, measured at a shear stress of 105 dynes cm2. The amorphous copolyamides can be prepared by known polymer condensation methods in the composition ratios mentioned above. In order to form high polymers the total moles of the acids employed should equal the total moles of the diamines employed. Representative aliphatic diamines containing 8 20 carbon atoms and at least one cyclohexane moiety or nucleus include l amino 3 aminomethyl 3,5,5 trimethylcyclohexane, i.e.,EMI5.1 1,4 bis aminomethyl cyclohexane, i.e.,EMI5.2 tb H2N CH2 SEP SEP CH2NH2, SEP bis p aminocyclohexyl tb methane, SEP i.e., SEP H2 SEP C4 cH SEP CI NHZ SEP , SEP and SEP the tb like. tb As normally made, the l amino 3 aminomethyl 3,5,5 trimethylcyclohexane and 1,4 bis ainomethyl cyclohexane are mixtures of the cis and trans isomers. Any isomer ratio may be used in this invention. Bis p am nocyclohexyl methane PACM hereinafter which can be used as one of the diamine components in this invention is usually a mixture of three stereolsomers. In this invention any ratio of the three may be used. The polymerization to prepare the amorphous copolyamide may be performed in accordance with known polymerization techniques, such as melt polymerization, solution polymerization and interfacial polymerization techniques, but it is preferred to conduct the polymerization in accordance with melt polymerization procedures. This procedure produces polyamides having high molecular weights. In melt polymerization, the 8 20 carbon cycloaliphatic diamine, hexamethylene diamine, terephthalic acid and isophthalic acid are mixed in such amounts that the ratio of the diamine components and the dicarboxylic acid components will be substantially equimolar and that the composition of these monomers will satisfy the mole percents recited above. Up to 40 percent by weight of optional monomers may be included as desired, such as caprolact2m, laurolactam,u aminocaproic acid, m aminoundecanoic acid, or a salt of 4 i2 carbon alkylene dicarboxylic acids and 2 12 carbon alkylene diamines. The components are heated at temperatures higher than the melting point of the resulting polyamide but lower than the degradation temperature thereof.Because of the volatility of the hexamethylene diaine, a slight excess is usually employed in the mix. The heating temperature is in the range of 170 to 3000C. The pressure can be in the range of from atmospheric pressure to 300 psig. The method of addition of startling monomers is not critical. For example, salts of combination of the diamines and acids can be made and mixed. It is also possible to disperse a mixture of the diamines in water, a d a prescribed amount of a mixture of acids to the dispersion at an elevated temperature to form a solution of a mixture of nylon salts, and subject the solution to the polymerization. If desired, a monovalent amine or, preferably, an organic acid, may be added as viscosity adjuster to a mixture of starting salts or an aqueous solution thereof. The amounts of the semicrystalline polyamide and the amorphous copolyamide present in the blend of this invention will depend on the purpose for which the blend is to be employed. For example, when transparency of molded articles is desired, the amorphous copolyamide will comprise the predominant component, and preferably will comprise at least 60 percent by weight of the blend. If the blend is to be annealed, it has been found that the amount of the amorphous copolyamide should be at least 70 percent in order to ensure good transparency. Furthermore, some semi crystalline polyamides such as 612 nylon, are incompatible with the amorphous copolyamides employed herein, and transparent molded articles are not obtained when such semicrystalline polyamides are used. However, such nontransparency does not affect the usefulness of the blend in other respects.. When the amorphous copolyamide is present in an amount between about 2 60 percent by weight, resultant molded articles have better resistance to the effect of moisture than semicrystalline polyamides alone, and when the amorphous polyamide is present in an amount of at least 20 percent by weight, resultant molded articles have good resistance to the effect of aqueous zinc chloride.This latter property is especially important when the blend is employed in automotive components such as tubing, cable jackets or molded parts. Such components need to be resistant to the corrosive effects of chloride salts used to de ice roadways ano chloride salts from sea mists. Such salts may either contain zinc chloride or form zinc chloride when in contact wih zinc automotive components. The blends of this invention can be prepared by mixing the semicrystalline polyamide with the amorphous copolyamide. Of course more than one of each such polyamides and copolyamides may be present. Preferably the components are physically mixed in small particle form, and are then intimately melt blended in the melt through a suitable melt extruder, molding machine, or any other equipment for melt blending. During mixing some transamidation may.. occur, the extent of such depending on factors such as temperature, residence time, and presence of substances that can catalyze the reaction. The blends may contain conventional fillers or reinforcing agents, such as glass, mica or the like, dyes, UV or heat stabilizers, flame retardants, antioxidants, or plasticizers. The blends can be molded into useful articles having good solvent resistance, good dimensional stability, and good retention of physical properties under moist or wet conditions. These qualities make the blends useful for producing shaped bodies, such as automobile fenders, bumpers and the like. PREPATION OF A3iLpOUS COPOLXIDES I. General The amorphous copolyamides were prepared in an autoclave.by reacting the aqueous salt solutions of the respective resins at a temperature normally below 3000C and a pressure normally below 300 psig for a suitable time, usually about two hours. When most of the water was evaporated, the pressure was gradually bled to atmospheric and the reaction was allowed to continue under vacuum until the desired molecular weight was attained. If lower molecular weight is desired, the final stage of the reaction can be carried out at atmospheric conditions rather than under vacuum. II.

The salt solution was then heated and the pressure allowed to rise to 250 psig and additional water was slowly bled off while maintaining the pressure. When the batch temperature reached about 2800C, the pressure was slowly reduced to atmospheric within 0 minutes followed by about 45 minute hold at atmospheric pressure. The polymer was then extruded from the autoclave by means of nitrogen pressure, quenched, and cut into pellets. The polymer was then surface coated with 0.09 weight percent of aluminum distearate lubricant. The inherent viscosity of the polymer was between 0.7 and 0.8.III.

EXA.M2LES TEST PROCEDURES Tensile strength and elongation were determined as described in ASwM D 638. The samples were tested dry as molded DAM and after conditioning to 50 percent relative huidi RH equilibrium moisture by boiling in potassium acetate solution 1.25 Ib potassium acetate per ib water . Flexural modulus was determined as described in ASTM D 790. Notched Izod was determined as described inD 256. Heat Deflection Temperature HDT was determined by annealing the polymer at 100 0c for 30 minutes prior to testing of Blends 1 5 and 200 C for 30 minutes prior to testing of Blends 8 and 9, and tested according to ASTK D 648. Relative Viscosity RV was determined byASTM D 789. Inherent Viscosity IV was determined at 250C in m cresol in accordance with ASTM D 2857. Zinc chloride resistance was tested as follows Five molded specimens of the resin having a rectangular form and a length of 5 inches, a width of one half inch and a thickness of one eighth inch were bent around the surface of a mandrel having a diameter of one inch and secured in such position.Each bent specimen was immersed in a 50 percent aqueous zinc chloride solution and inspected periodically for formation of stress cracks. Mold shrinkage was determined on molded 5 xl 2 xl 8 specimens. The specimens were placed in 50 percent RH at room temperature and the length of the specimens measured after 48 hours. The shrinkage is calculated from the dimension of the mold cavity in m.ils inch. PREPARATION OF BLENDS Blends 1 7 of the examples below were prepared using either a 28 mm or 53 mm Werner BR Pfleiderer twin screw extruder. Blends 8 and 9 were made using a single screw extruder. The crystalline nylon and copolyamides were mixed in their proper proportions in a suitable vessel such as a drum or bag. The nylon mixture is then melt blended in the extruder at about 2700 3000C. Any temperatures above the melting point of the crystalline polyamide may be used but other considerations such as rate, melt viscosity, and possible degradation of the polymer at high temperatures are some of the factors to be considered in the selection of processing temperature. The material exiting the die is quenched in water, cut into pellets, and sparged with nitrogen until cold to remove moisture. The dried material is molded into test specimens using a 5 or 6 oz. screw injection molding machine. Percents are by weight unless otherwise indicated. The Blends referred to in the Tables below are blends of this invention. The blends are composed of the following ingredients.Blend 1 80 percent copolyamide I Preparation A having an IV of 0.93, and 20 percent 66 nylon having a relative viscosity of about 52.Blend 2 80 percent copolyamide II having an IV of 0.87, and 20 percent of the 66 nylon used above.

Blend 4 is completely opaque indicating incompatibility of the copolyamide with nylon 612.SOLVENT RESISTANCE Resistance to the effect of organic solvents of the copolyamides can be increased by incorporating amounts of crystalline polyamides. Resistance to solvents is measured by use of a quarter elliptical mandrel with a minor and major semi axis of 1.8 inch and 8 inch respectively. A sample is clamped on the face of the elliptical jig and immersed in the test solvent.Based on the location of stress cracks on the major axis, the minimum strain or stress for failure in that particular solvent can be calculated. Since the blends have relatively comparable modulus, it is sufficient to rank them based on the minimum strain for failure. Higher percent strain at failure indicates greater resistance. Results from this test are summarized in Table 2.
