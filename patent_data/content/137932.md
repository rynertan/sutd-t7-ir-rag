# Pressure control system.

## Abstract
A highly accurate pressure control system adapted to control fluid pressure in apparatus such as the air pressure in vehicle tires comprises a control module 210 having an air pressure selector 211 for selecting a desired air pres sure and a pressure to voltage transducer circuit 230 for generating a signal representative of the actual air pres sure. Signals representative of the difference between ac tual and desired air pressure are applied to comparator circuitry 246, 248 which control output switches 254, 256 for activating an inflate deflate valve 220 to inflate or de flate the tires so as to achieve and maintain the desired air pressure. Various circuitry of the control module 210 em ploy reference signals maintained at reference values held constant relative to a common power supply voltage instead of to a ground reference 218 , thus minimizing circuit count and power dissipation while providing sufficient current for operating output switches 254, 256 .
