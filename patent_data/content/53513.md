## Abstract
An APD as a light absorbing layer 3 and an active layer 5. Between the light absorbing layer 3 and the active layer 5 a middle layer 4 is provided. A p n junction is formed in the active layer 5 which seen in cross section is step shaped with a rela tively deep part of the lunction providing a light sensitive re gion, and a relatively shallow part of the junction, surrounding the relatively deep part, providing a guard ring region. Alternatively, a p n junction may be formed in the active layer 5 which has a flat bottom and gradually inclined sides. The flat bottom part of the p n junction providing a light sensi tive region, and the inclined sides providing a guard ring re gion. As a further alternative, the middle layer 4 is omitted and a surface layer 16 formed on the active layer 5. A wellshaped p n junction is formed in the surface layer 16 and the active layer 5, the bottom of the well shaped p n junction being in the active layer 5.
