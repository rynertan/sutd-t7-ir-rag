# A method of feeding animals.

## Abstract
Animals, in particular pigs, are fed restrictively for a predetermined first period lasting at least one day so as to bring about increased cell division in the animal, which first period is followed by overfeeding the animal for another predetermined period, also lasting at least one day, so as to cause growth of the cells formed during the first period, and preferably alternating the periods of restrictive feeding and overfeeding until the animal has reached the desired weight, which occurs faster than when an animal is fed by a conventional feeding method. To further the production of digestive enzymes, animals are subjected to sensory stimuli in the form of signals generated at each feeding place and varied in the course of a period of time so as to condition the animal to expect the supply of feed at a given moment. For pigs, the stimuli may comprise a reproduction of a sequence of the sow s suckling grunt accelerating towards the delivery of a mouth ful of feed.

## Description
A METHOD OF FEEt lNG ANIMALSThe present invention relates to a method of feeding animals, especially young animals,From, e.g., British Patent Specification No. 2,05e,837, it is known to increase the productivity in the production of animals, In particular Piss, by nteans of feeding the pigs at their respective feeding places during each feeding period with a portion of feed substantially corre sponging to one mouthful or a few mouthfuls in such a way that the portions are supplied at such intervals that the amount of feed sup plied oorre3ponds to the desired eating rate of each animal, thus securing that each pig receives the same amount of feed.Such a method of feeding ensures that all the pigs in the same sty are fed according to a desired standard, and that all pigs In the same sty have a relatively homogeneous growth development so that they reach the desired weight substantially simultaneously, The mouthful wise dosage of feed influences the pigs to eat considerably more slowly than had been obtained previously in the known art, Also, by means of feeding pigs substantially mouthful wise, competitive eating is prevented, thus obtaining an Improved utilization of the feed i nestedThe feeding principle disclosed in the above mentioned British PatentSpecification No. 2,056,837, known as the Biomat7r t principle, can be said to mainly comprise a control of the number of faedlngs, and, during each feeding session, a control of the number of tnouthfuls administered, and the lengths of the pauses between each mouthful to obtain a fixation of each pig at its feeding place. The beneficial effect of this, namely that each pig receives the same amount of feed, has been established to result in an increase of the feed utilization for the group of pigs by 7 9 .In particular for pigs which are older than the weaning age, the Biomat feeding principle has an additional important advantage in that th yiya raapond to the feeding rhythm of the feeding apparatus by building up a conditioned reflex, by which the salivary glands and gastric glands start an increased production at the moment the pIgs hear the start of the feeding appa ratus. This reflex also builds up increased enzymatic and salivary production during the pauses between the mouthfuls. This conditioned reflex has been established to improve the feed utilization up to as much as additionally 15 2081. The object of the method of the present invention is to increase the productivity in the production of animals even further than that obtained by the feeding method disclosed in the above nientioned British patent Thus, by the method of the present invention, it is pos s ible to ain a greater efficiency in the use of production facile ties in that animals fed according to the method of the invention have a higher daily gain and therefore reach the desired weight faster than has been obtained in the known art. In one aspect, the present Invention relates to a method of controlled ceding of animals which comprises feeding each animal restrictively ror a pradttermined first period lasting at least one day, and pre ferabty several days, so as to bring about increased cell division in the animal, which first period is followed by overfeeding the animal fo r another predetermined period, also lasting at least one day, so as to cause growth of the cells formed during the first period.The periods of restrictive feeding and overfeeding. respectively, may preferably be alternated until the animal has reached the desired weight, In the present specification and claims, the term controlledµ is understood to mean that the periods of restrictive feeding and over feeding are intentional and regulated.Preferably, the control of the feeding is performed on the basis of data or algorithms expressing relations between the average weight of the animals, the age of the animals, the previous adminIstrations of feed to the animals, etc., in a manner which is known per se, for example from the above mentioned British Patent No. 2,056,837. In the most practical embodiment, the algorithms and the data are coded into a computer which regulates the administration of the feed in accordance with the desired regimen. In the present specification and claims, the term restrictive feeding or feeding restrictively is understood to mean that the amount of feed administered to the animal during the first period is lower than the optimal average previously determined for the particular animalSpecies involved, and the race and age of the animal in question. The decrease In the amount of feed administered is normally in the range of I0 50 , such as 20 50 , especially 20 4096, such as 20 30 , calculated on the weight of the average optimal amount of feed.Similarly, the term overfeeding is understood to mean that the amount of fe administered to the animal during the second period is higher than the optimal average previously determined for the animal in questior. In particular 20 50 higher, especially about 30 higher.The methods of the invention utilizes the well known principle of natural biorhythms in animals. One such rhythm governs the way in which animals grow. Animal growth is not regular, but may sub stantially be divided into two phases one phase during which division or muitiplicaflon of the body cells takes place without any actual growth of these cells, and another phase during which each of the cells obtained during the first period grows, and the growth continues until the cell has become sufficiently large to divide once more,In other words upon cell division, each cell has a certain genetically determined growth potential.It is believed to be possible to influence this natural biorhythm by the method of the present invention so that, if animals are fed restrictively, they will enter a phase where the maior part of the available energy is utilized for cell division rather than cell growth and energy depositing. The increased cell multiplication activity may be of the order of about 20 , dependent on the reduction of the amount of feed administJred to the animal. It is, however, important to kcep in mind that this phase of cell division only occurs when the primary energy depots of the body have been used up. The length of the restrictive feeding period is thus relatively shorter with young animals, as these have only very small primary energy depots, if any, and proportionally longer with older animals. It is evident that the re strictive feeding should not be an inadequate feeding with such a low energy supply that the muscle tissue of the animals begins to degenerate.When, after the period of restrictive feeding, the animal is administared an nount of feed which Is larger than the optimal average determined for the. particular animal, the growth potential of the cells formed during the first phase is utilized so that all the cells formed grow to norm2s size which causes a corresponding Increase in the weight of the animal, which means that animals fed according to the method of the invention will eventually obtain an increase in weight which may ba up to as much as e.g. 20 relative to animals which are, at all times, fed uniformly according to the determined optimal average. In order to produce the desired effect it is advantageous to increase the amount of feed epme time prior to the second phase in older to take into account the time lag before the increase of the amount of feed takes effect. The factor determining the transition from the first period to the second period is, among other things, the increased amount of feed . The cycle of cell division and cell growth is closely connected with the hormonal level of the animal, i . e. the concentration of growth hormone from the pituitary gland, thyroxin from the thyroid gland, etc. It Is advantageous that the feed intake in the overfeeding period is as high as possible.According to pre ferried embodiments of the invention, discussed in greater detail below, particular measures are available for stimulating the feed intake of the animals during the overfeeding period, such as controlled variation in the feed composition, or controlled use of stimuli.As a general rule, the period of restrictive feeding should preferably extend over a period of days, such as 1 5 days, preferably 3 5 days, especially 3 days, and the period of overfeeding should last at least one day such as 1 5 days, and with respect to pigs, the period of overfeeding should typically last 2 days However, depending upon the particular animal species and the particular conditions in question, suitable and optional periods may be ascertained by the person skilled in the art based on the present disclosure.Parameters which may be employed to assess the effect of the feeding strategy and adjusting and optimizing the feeding schedule are, i.a., the following the weight of the animals, the daily weight gain of the animals, the consumed amount of feed units consumed per unit of weight gain, the character of the manure in particular the consistency of the manure avoidance of diarrhoea , the amount of energy in the feed supplied, the amount of energy in excrement and urine, the amount of crude protein in the feed, the amount of crude protein in excrement and urine, and the percentage of pure meat in the animals ready for killing.Although the pattern of restrictive feeding and overfeeding seems to be then most important factor influencing the above mentioned natural biorhythm of the animal with respect to growth, it may also be possible to assist the shift In this biorhythm by means of exposing the animal to changes in external conditions and or other factors influen cing the animal in connection with alternating the feeding periods.In other words, the additional factors likely to influence the biorhythm of cell division and cell growth comprise factors whtoll are principally directed to psychologically influencing the animal, such as changes In light, sound and heat stimuli, the smell, taste and contistt ncy of the feed, the habitat of the animal and, to a minor degree, the çomposi tion of the feed The method according to the invention may be used for feeding ani vials which are placed In separate enclosures or which are placed in groups in the same enclosure.Thus, it may be advantageous to place social animals in groups as a sound and natural behaviour of a social animal is strongly dependent on the influences and interactions preveiling in the animal group Ce.g., formation of hierarchy and ultimately results in a higher yield of meat from each animal. If the animals are placed in groups it is Important to ensure that each animal has access to a feeding place without being displaced by the stronger animals In the group so that each animal receives the stipulated amount of feed. The homogenous consumption of feed may be ensured by using the feedlng principle disclosed in the above men toned British patent. The method according to the present invention may, however, also be used in connection with any conventional feeding method.Thus, in a particularly advantageous embodiment, feeding sessions according to the restrictive feeding overfeeding strategy of the present invention are performed by simultaneously feeding a plurality of untcthered animals at their respective feeding places in the same enclosure in which all feeding places are freely accessible to all the animals, and supplying portions of feed to each of the feeding places during feeding period at intervals ensuring that the amount of feed supplied to each feeding place substantially corresponds to a desired predeterninad eating rate of the animals.Placing untethered animals in groups in the same enclosure has the added advantage that the animals z elop a synchronized biorhythm so that by restrictive feeding ana overfeading of the animals, respectively, a synchronized feed utilization is obtained. The method according to the present invention is especially advan tagus when used to feed young animals, that is, pre pubescent animals, e.g., mammals at the weaning stave, or poultry such as chickens o5 turkeys, as young animals have an optimal growth potentidal. Thus, an optimal feeding according to the principle of the invention ensures an optimal utilization of the feed administered to the animal. In young animals, even large amounts of feed ingested are more likely to convert to meat rather than fat than is the case with older animals, thus improving the slaughtering quality of the animal. it is generally known that animals learn to respond to a given signal very quickly if they receive a reward. This learning capacity of the animals may be utilized to positively influence the behaviour pattern, especially the eating reflex, of th. animals. Such influence is mainly connected with stimulating the sensory apparatus of the animals so that the specific stimuli given may affect the visual, auditory, tactile, gustatory or olfactory sense. As indicated above, the advantage of stimulating the animals eating reflex Is due to the fact that such a sensory stimulation enhances the production of digestive enzymes thus ensuring an optimal utilization of each mouthful of feed administered. For instance, it is well known that pigs are very observant to different sounds, and in accordance with what has been stated above, if, e.g., the food dispensing valve of the feeding place opens with a click before feeding, and if, furthermore, this valve opens before the distribution of each portion of feed, it has been noted that each clickIncreases th pigs interest in the feeding trough, as they have learned that the click is shortly followed by a portion of feed.According to another aspect of the invention, the utilization of stimuli is intensified to obtain an improved feed utilization and a butter daily gain based on an improved utilization of the conditioned reflexes of ths animal. in this aspect, the invention relates to a method of feeding a plurality of untethered animals at their respective feeding places in the same enclosure where all feeding places are freely accessible to all the animals, the method comprising supplying portions of feed to each feeding place during a feeding period at inter vals ensuring that the amount of feed supplied to each feeding place substa tiaily corresponds to a desired predetermined eating rate of the animais, and generating a signal at each feeding place over a period of time preceding the supply of each portion of feed, the signal being varied in the course of this period of time so as to condition the animal to expect the supply of each portion of feed at a given moment.The signal may La an ar Pustic signal, I.e. a signal which affects the auditory sense of the animals, but it may also be a signal which affects the visual, tactile, gustatory or olfactory sense of the animal, or any combination of these influences may be utilized. The variation of the signal may be a variation in intensity or frequency of the signal, and or it may be a superimposition of a signal on other types of signal. in practice, visual and auditory signals will normally be most suitable for the purpose, although it cannot be precluded that for certain animals, tactile signals may be employed to advantage. In this aspect of the present invention, which may to be employed to advantage in connection with the restrictive feeding overfeeding method disclosed above, Inter cilia because it enhances the animalst acceptance and utilization of the overfeeding, but which is not limited to being employed in connection with the restrictive feeding overfee ding method, the principle of stimulating the animal s sensory apparatub has been developed further In order to increase the patience of the animal to be fed in that, according to the present invention, the signal may be extended over a period of time and varied in the course or this period whereby the animal is made to awaIt the moment when the portion of feed is supplied to the feeding place and conditioned to receive and utilize the portion of feed Thus, by means of stimuiatlng the animals interest, It may be possible to introduce a prolonged pause between each portion to secure a longer period of feed consumption since, when for instance a prolonged and varied acoustic signal is generated the minimal may be flxated at its feeding plate for a relatively longer period in expectation of a reward, i.e.the next portion offed. Without such a signal, the interval between portions would necessarily have to be relatively brief as the animal would become impatient and begin to change places with the other animals in the enclosure. Thus, the positive effect of stimulating the production of digestlve enzymes would be lost.The feed which is administered to the animals in accordance with either or both of the above disclosed methods may be any feed composltion suitable for the animals in question at the particular stage of development in question. However, when the methods of the invention are utilized for feeding young animals, an additional beneficial effect with respect to the development and weight gain of the animals is obtained by adapting the composition of the feed to the development of the animals in accordance with the principles disclosed in Interna tonal Patent Application No PCT DK82 00023 and equivalent national applications, all of which claim priority from Danish Patent ApplicationNo. 1194 81. In accordance with these principles, the ratio between digestible protein and other feed constituents, in particular carbohydrates, In the feed of thR Animals i, adapted to the d lopmont of the animals, through at least substantially dally adjustment of the said ratio. As appears from the following, it is preferred that the ratio be adjusted substantially at each feeding. In one main aspect, this principle is characterized in that a mixture comprising digestible protein is fed in fluid form and a basic feed comprising carbohydrates is fed as a solid material, and that the ratio between digestible protein and other constituents, in particular car bohydrate, in the total feed consisting substantially of the combination of the fluid mixture and the basic feed is adjusted to the development of the digestion system of the animals through at least substantiaily daily adjustment.According to this principle, the adjustment of the ratio between di gestibie protein and carbohydrate is performed in a most suitable and convenient manner by adjustment of the ratio between the said fluid mixture and tha said basic feed.In the following, reference will be made only to pigs, in particular pigs of up to 40 kg or even porkers up to slaughtering weight, as the animals to be restrlstively fed overfed and or influenced by sensory stimuli and optionally to be fed according to the above men tioned prjnciFLe of being fed with a mixture comprising digestible protein in fluid form and a basic feed comprising carbohydrates as a solid material and, optionally, adjusting the ratio between digestible protein and other constituents through at least substantially daily adjustment, although it will be understood that other species of animal may also be fed accordlng to the methods of the invention. During experiments wlth the learning capacity of pigs, it has been observed that an acoustic signal such as a click is often not sufficient to hold the attention of very young pigs According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the signal which is varied inIntensity prior to the administration of a portion of feed may be a reproduction of a series of sow suckling grunts with the grunt fre quench increasing towards the administration of a portion of feed.Between the portions, it Is also preferred to reproduce a series of sow suckling grunts with increasing grunt frequency.A typical reproduction of a sow suckling grunt series for use in the method of the invention is as follows About 1 2 minutes prior to the administration of the first feed portion, grunts are emitted at a frequency of about one grunt per 2.5 seconds. About 10 25 seconds prior to the administration of the first portion, the grunting rate is accelerstedso that the grunt frequency is about one grunt per 0.6 seconds immediately prior to the administration of the feed portion, the grunting being stopped exactly at the moment when the feed portion is administered.Then, there is a pause of a duration of a few seconds, .g., about 5 seconds, and then, a grunting sequence correspond .ng to the last seconds, e.g., the last 5 seconds, of acce lerating grunts prior to the administration of the first feed portion is re emitt this procedure is repeated prior to each portion of feed. The sow suckling grund is a characteristic and very specific grunting sound produced by the sow when suckling her pigs. A detailed de scription of the sow suckling grunt and grund sequence is given in Conftnement and continuous noise as environmental factors affecting communication in the domestic pig , by Per Jensen, published by the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Departmentof Animal Hygiene, Report 8, Skara, 1983. The sosvis suckling grunt may for example be recorded and broad casted in the pig sty by means of reproduction equipment placed in the feedin machines. The reproduction equipment may, e.g., corn prise a me articaI, magnetic or semiconductor storage in which the grunt frequency is stored. It is also possible to install reproduction equipment generating other acoustic signals in a similar way so as to provide the signal most optimal to the particular stage of development of the pigs. Also, the frequency and intensity of the acoustic signal may be adjusted to the optimal influencing level.For example, the sound may be produced with increasingly shorter intervals until the moment of feed supply in order to raise the pigs expectation of a reward which, as mentioned above, furthers the production of di restive enzymes.However, the feeding frequency may not be uniform throughout the pigpen. Pigs which have just been taken from the sow are fed more frequently than pigs which are somewhat older. it is normally not possible to differentiate between the feeding frequencies of the indi vidual sties in the same pigpen by means of acoustic signals as such a signal will normally be audible throughout the pen and, consequent ly, will cause agitation among the pigs which are not fed when the signal is generated. If, on the other hand, the pigs are taught to respond to a combination of light and acoustic signals instead so as to expect to be fed only when both the acoustic signal and the light signal is generated, which may be done individually in each sty, any additional acoustic signals wIll eventually be ignored by the pigs.Thus, according to the principle of the invention, it is possible to stimulate the pigs interest in the feeding place by means of light signals as well as acoustic signals so as to supplement the acoustic signals provided in the interval between each mouthful with light signals or to substitute light signals for acoustic signals altogether. A gradually increasing Intensity of light towards the moment when the next mouthful is provided is likely to result in a similar effect as described above with respect to fixation and conditioning of the pigs as when an acoustic sIgnal is produced. Thus, the provision of a light signal wili produce the same effect of stimulating the production of diestive nzymes, thus optimizing the digestive process.It is known that young pigs are attracted by thermal radiation. When pigs are born they are directed to the sow s belly by the increased heat radiation from her belly relative to the heat radiation from her fat insulat cI back. If the pigs are weaned very early at about 2 3 weeks if may be envisaged that the pigs will be drawn to the feeding place if the above mentioned signals are combined with thermal radla tion from the feeding machine. The thermal radiation may advantageously be combined with the light signals, e.g. by installing 2 sunlamp like apparatus In the feeding machine.By applying the feeding method described above, in particular with respect to the variations In sensory stimuli, it is pOssible o introduce longer feeding periods as the animals no longer engage in competitive eating since their interest becomes directed solely to their respective feeding places, and the interval between each mouthful may be pro longed to ensure an optimal utilization of the feed consumed. Thus, in contradistinction to the known feeding methods where pigs are fed about 3 times a day for a period of about 3 5 minutes, it is now possible to feed pigs according to the principles of the present invention for any period of time per feeding session.For example, it is possIble to feed pigs of a weight of 5 90 kg for periods of up to, e.g. 20 minutes at each feeding session, with at least 6 feeding sessions a day, thereby obtaining a better feed conversion and a higher daily gain. On the other hand, it is also possible to feed weaning plg times a day for correspondingly shorter feeding sessions, such as feeding sessions of a duration of about 2.5 minutes 18 tlmes a day, which is then gradually changed into about 20 minutes Gtimes a day when the pigs have a weight of about 20 30 kg. Particulariy during the weaning period, the digestive system of the pigs is subject to a quick and dramatic development with respect to th capacity t produce digestive enzymes As an example, the Inte stine of a weaning pig grows about 20 cm per day. known feeding methods are not sufficiently adjusted to this quick change.According to a preferred principle of the present invention, the pigs, in parti ocular durn the weaning period, are fed with a feed mixture adjusted to the enzyme production of the pigs or to a desired development of the enzyme production of the pigs by frequent adjustments of the composition of the feed1 the quantitative administration of the feed and the intervals at which the feed is administered. As indicated above, it is preferred to adjust the composition of the feed at least daily during the weaning period, and indeed, in a preferred embodi ment, an adjustment of the composition is performed during the individual feeding. As mentioned above, the adjustment of the composition of the feed may easily be obtained by mixing the feed for each feeding from at least three stock constituents, one of which being a normal carbohy drate rlch feed such as gritting, the other one being a fluid mixture having a high content of digestible protein or available protein, in particular a high content of protein of animal origin, and the third one being water, optionally containing additives. Thus, in this principle of the invention, the total consumption of the pigs may be a mixture of e.g. water, a carbohydrate rich conventonal feedstuff such as gritting and a fluid feed material with a high content of digestible protein, in particular protein from animal sour cues. The adjustment of the composition of the feed and or the quantitative administration of the feed for the development of the digestion system of the pigs or for a desired accelerated development of the digestive system of the pigs is preferably performed through at least daily adjustments of the total composition fed to the pigs during a feeding session macroadjustment , and, according to the above mentioned preferred embodiment, through adjustment of the ratio between available protein in fluid form and other constituents, In particular carbohydrates, even during the Individual feeding microadjustment . The macroadjustment may be performed in strict accord dance with a curve which represents the optimal ratio between digestile protein and other feed constituents, in particular the ratio between digestible protein and carbohydrate.This optimum curve may be the curve which is known or ay be found to be true for the animals in question under normal, favourable development, or it may be 2 curve wnich represents the optimal conditions during a deve moment which is deliberately accelerated using the principle of the present invention.In both cases, it Is Important to perform the macroadjusvme of the feed for the desired development of the pigs vary frasuently and during the weaning period preferably at least daily and most preferably substantially at each feeding, as a less frequent adjustment would mean that the pigs receive a feed which is not optimal for their development and or that parts of the feed come position are in fact wasted a less frequent adjustment would also mean more dramatic changes in the food composition at each adjustment which may cause stomach upset. In connection with the restrictive feeding overfeeding strategy in par ticular, it Is envisaged to be advantageous to adjust the ratio between carbohydrate and protein constituents in the feed In such a manner that the carbohydrate rich constituent is admixed with a lower amount of protein typically an average reduction of 10 lS w relative to the standard intake of protein for the stage of development in question during the restrictive feeding period, while the amount of protein is increased during the overfeeding period, typically an average increase of 25 30 on the same basis. As mentioned above, the feed composition may also advantageously be changed during the individual feeding microadjustment so that in addition to he establishment of the optimum feed composition adapted to the development stage of the animal as secured through the ratio between the total amounts of the feed constituents delivered during a feeding, a dynamic adjustment of the feed composition to the relative capacity reiative with respect to the feed composition of the di gestion system is obtained during the feeding.Such adjustment during the feeding will normally be one which delivers a relatively higher content of digestible protein and a relatively tower content of carbo hydrates in the feed at the beginning of the feeding and a relatively lower content of digestible protein and a relatively higher content of car6oh ydrate at the end of the feeding In a prefeZ embodiment of the method according to this principle, the feed is mixed from stock constituents of the kind mentioned above Iridividually from pigsty to pigsty and from day to day, preferably from feeding to feeding, and, according to one preferred embodi ment, the composition is microadjustedit during the individual fee ding by meons of a feeding apparatus which provides mouthful wise dosage, preferably a feeding apparatus of the type described in the abovemeratione british Patent No. 2,058,837 or any other apparatus capable of performing the method described in the above mentioned patent applications. The Ingredients employed may e.g. be water, gritting and a fluid supplemental feed material with a high content of digestible protein. A suitable composition of the fluid supplemental feed material results In the attaInment of the above optimization of the foodstuffs with respect to the ability of the pigs to utilize them when the ratio between the supplemental feed material and the gritting is varied. Also, the fluid form of the protein rich supplemental feed material makes it possible to add, in advance, enzymes such as pepsin which will function partly as a pre digestion and partly as an accelerator of the development of the digestion system of the pigs.In addition, additives of various conventional kinds such as trace minerals, iron supplements, growth promoting antibiotics, and or therapeutic drugs or microorganism cultures may be added to the fluid suppiemental feed material.According to one aspect of this principle, the fluid feed material used as a protein rich supplemental feed substantially consists of consti tuents. which have not been exposed to any substantial drying treatment. Such a feeding material may easily be administered by means of, e.g., a feeding apparatus of the type disclosed in the abovementioned Britrsh patent and may w when the ratio between administration of liquid and solid feed is adjusted in the feeding apparatus be used as one stock constituent for the above mentloned frequent adjustment of the total teed composition for optimum adjustment to the development of the pigs.An impottant example of a fluid protein rich supplemental feed nta teriat Is a protein soup which is mainly based on such materials as blood, slsushtcrhause waste, partially digested intestine content from slaughterhouses, industrial protein waste, e.g. from the canned food industry or the snack industry, and household food waste, preferably nutritively balanced with such protein rich constituents as fish pulp, whey, yeast cream, skim milk, etc. Such a fluid supplemental feed material may, e.g., utilize the very considerable amounts of waste products from the slaughterhouss and dairies without the expensive and often partly destructive working up process, and the material may wholly or partially replace expensive feed materials such as dried protein. In the methods of the invention, the feeding rhythm and feeding mechanIsm is preferably adjusted to be In the best possible accordance with the development of the pigs. Thus, the weaning period may start by feeding with same frequency as sows suckle the pigs, i.e. frequent at the beginning and then little by little and gradually increasing the time intervals between the feedings. Also, the feeding rhythm may, according to one embodiment of the Invention, be changed during each individual feeding by changing the interval between the mouthfuls, in order to obtain a dynamic adaption of the rata at which the mouthfuls are served to the capacity of the pigs during each feeding session. Tha fluid supplemental feed material according to the above mentioned principle is preferably composed in such a manner that solely by boing combined with the carbohydrate rich constltuent, e g. barley gritting, and with the water dosed at the feeding in a varying ratio, it may meet the nutritive demand for every stage of development for pigs from 2 weeks or 3 weeks and up tilf slaughter weight. Thas, one single supplemental feed material meets the total demand for supplemental feed during the whole breeding period. Another possibility constituting a preferred embodiment Is to work with a special supplemental feed material which nutritively is composed so that it meets the above mentioned demands during the weaning pcriod, that is, normally during the period where the pigs are from 2 to 12 weeks old, but also including the cases where the pigs are weaked in a very young age such as the second day after farrowing .The fluid supplemental feed material of the Invention may as previously mentioned be based, e.g., on blood from slaughterhouses and slaughterhouss waste which has been sufficiently comminuted and distributed in the blood. Also dairy waste, e.g. whey and casein waste from cheese production, is a good basis for the supplemental feed material.Raw fish pulp may suitably also be a constituent of the fluid supplemental feed material, in that, in addition to showing the well known valuable protein composition, it also has a beneficial influence in that it contributes to lower the viscosity of the supplemental feed, and in that the pepsin from the fish mats has a hydrolyzing effect on the proteins. Household food waste, suitably obtained from households where the waste Is sorted in a food waste part and a non food waste part, constitutes another interesting source of available protein, and will often show an amino acid balance which may be utilized to balance the final amino acid balance of the fluid supplemental feed material.The production of the supplemental feed material will usually simply consist in a mixing of the constituents, if necessary with communition of possible solId constituents which are to be distributed in the resulting fluid material. The resulting protein soup , which normally has a dry matter content of about 20 45 , typically about 25 40 , is thereafter normally autoclaved. If the protein soup has a too high viscosity at room temperature, enzymes may be added to lower the viscosity. Preservation of the protein soup may be performed by adjusting the pH to an acidic value in a manner known per se by addition of an acceptable acid such as formic acid.Another preserve tion method is addition of microorganism cultures which will generate acid to lower the pH, e.g., lactic acid producing bacteria Examples of bacteria which are suitable for this purpose are Lactobacillus oc Idophll s, J cctobocilOus plantaro, L ocft ocllIus lactis, or Strepto coccus lactis or Streptococcus ctebrls. The preservation of the protein soup may also be obtained by autoclaving or by using normal preserving additives.The fluid supplemental feed material may suitably be made by the same known processes as are used for preparing dried protein rich animal feed from the same types of materials, but omitting the final drying stage.in order to obtain a standardization of the fluid supplemental feed material and to avoid that variations In the delivery of raw materials will result in too great variations in the final fluid material, it may ba desirable to divide the fluid or the raw materials into components according to composltion, e.g., into fat, protein, and collage water, etc, and thereafter to combine these components in desired ratios to obtain a standardized product. The character of the supplemental feed and the way in which it is prepared make it possible to add desired additives, such as enzymes, microorganisms, vitamins, which would be completely or partially destroyed in the conventional processes for manufacturing pig feed. In many cases, It may be advantageous to start the feeding of pigS at the beginning of the weaning period with protein soup only and then, as soon as the pigs have been succesfully start to train their enzyme system induce the production of enzymes decomposing vege table inatter by administering a carbohydrate rich feed in increasing proportions Gritting has been found to be a suitable carbohydrate source for this enzyme training .Once then pigs have been successfully started using a high proportion of digestible protein, their development will be faster and they will sooner become able to utilize carbohydrate and non animal protein.When a microadjustment Is performed, this may typically comprise addition of proportionally more protein soup at the start of the feeding e. about 50 75 more than the nominal amount to be the average , and proportionally less during the later minutes of the feedin , SO as to obtain the average desired according to the macroadjustment .. In this manner, the capacity and secretion of the digestion system of the pigs is optimally utilized. In addition to the above mentioned parameters improvIng the feed utilization and weight gain of the pigs, it may also be advantageous, as an additional parameter, to institute a diurnal rhythm in which a considerable proportion of each day g feed ration, particularly about 50 , is administered early in the day such as between 6 a.m and 12 a.m., and the remainder of the feed is administered at regular Inter vals throughout the rest of the day. This may preferably be accomplished in practice by coding the desired cycle and diurnal rhythm into a computer which controls the feeding system. As an example, a combination of one kg of basic feed and one kg of protein soup which may e.g. be used for pigs having a weight of about 7 9 kg contains the following per feed unit digestible fat 59 grams digestible protein 176 grams digestible lysine 10.4 grams digestible methlonine 3.5 grams digestible cystine 2.3 grams calcium 11.5 grams phosphorus 9.3 gramsFor pigs o, an age of 10 11 weeks, weight about 20 24 kg, a pre ferried combination 1 kg of basic feed and 0.5 kg of protein soup contains the following constituents per feed until digestible fat 39 grams digestible protein 160 grams digestible lysine 8.9 grams digestible methlonine 3.0 grams digestible cystine 2.4 grams calcium 7.3 grams phosphorus 7,0 grams in the present specifIcatIon and claims, the term feed unit indi cates a Scandinavian feed unit which is equivalent to the energy content of 1 kg of barley , more precisely stated 7730 kJ tor 1845 kcal .

EXAMPLE 1With respect to pigs, a presently preferred embodiment of the feeding method of the invention is performed according to the following para meters The temperature in the pigsty is varied according to the age weight of the pigs, starting with a temperature in the range of 26 300C and decreasing. to a temperature in the range of 16 2O C according to the schedule stated below. Weight, kg 6 9 t2 15 18 21 24 27 30 33 36 Temp. C 30 29 28 28 27 26 25 24 23 22 21 20The number of f2edings is also adjusted according to the age weight of the animals in such a way that the number decreases with increasing weight of the animal, as outlined below.Weight, kg 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20No. of feedings 18 17 16 15 14 13 12 11Weight, kg 22 24 26 28 34 40No. of feedings 10 9 8 7 in the weight interval from 6 to 7 kg, only protein soup is administered to the pigs. Then barley gritting is added in increasing quantities,The amount of feed to be administered to each animal is calculated on the basis of the predetermined optimal average energy intake expressed as y 0,06x 0.21, where x indicates the weight of the pigs and y indicates the number of feed units per day.During the period of restrictive feeding, the pigs are then administered an amount of feed amounting to 50 80 of the optimal average, preferably 70 of the optimal average, for 1 5 days, preferably 3 days, after which the amount of feed administered Is increased to 120 150 , especially 130 , of the optlmal average for 1 5 days, particularly 2 days. As an additional parameter, a diurnal rhythm may be incorporated in which a major portion of each day a feed ration, particularly about 50 , is administered early in the day such as between 6 a.m. and 12 a.m, the remainder of the feed being administered at rcgular intervals throughout the rest of the day.The feed is administered on a mouthful wise basis with a specified interval between each mouthful. The size of each mouthful varies according to the age weight of the animals as outlined below.Weight, kg 6 9 12 15 18 21 40Size of mouthful, g 2 3 4 5 6 7The interval between each mouthful is initially about 7 10 seconds, but after the passage of one third to one half of each feeding, the interval Is gradually ihcreased to about 15 20 seconds.When a weight of 7 kg has been reached, the feed may be dosed as a homogeneous mixture of protein soup, gritting and water, but preferably the feed is dosed in such a way that pure protein soup is administered at the beginning of each feeding period until half of the prescribed amount of soup has been administered after which the amount of gritting and water is gradually increased.The sensory stimulation of the pigs before and during feeding Is established by, e.g., adjusting an acoustic generator located at the feeding apparatus to start emitting a summoning grunt sequence about two minutes before administration of the first mouthful, a grunt being emitted every 2.5 seconds. About 25 seconds before the first mouthful is administered, the grunting rate is accelerated so that the grunt frequency is increased to about 1.6 grunts per second. The sound emission is synchronized with the administration of the following mouthful in such a way that the grunting sound is stopped exactly at the moment the mouthful is admlnlstered, Then, there is a pause of a few seconds In the grunting.About 5 seconds before the next mouthful, a grunting sequence corresponding to the last 5 seconds of grunting prior to the first mouthful Is emitted. Similarly, emission of light from a source located at each feeding place is synchronized with the supply of each mouthful in such a way that the intensity of the light is gradually increased towards the moment when a mouthful is supplied, the intensity being greatest immediately prior to the supply of the mouthful. EXAMPLE 2 A group of 10 pigs of an average weight of 41.2 kg were fed restric tively for on. week with a conventional feed mix comprising barley gritting, soy protein, and minerals, etc., using a Biomat apparatus of the type descriload in British Patent No. 2,056,837. During the restricive feeding period of one week, the amount of feed administered was 11 below the standard. During this period, the feed conversion dropped slightly the ratio between consumed feed units and kg of gain increased from 1.8 to i.9 . The daily gain was reduced focm444 to 7 Oh the average. Then , overfeeding was performed for one week The amount of feed administered was 21 above the standard. This overfeeding resulted in an increase of the feed conversion the ratio feed units kg gain dropped from 1.9 to 1.8 , and the dally gain increased dramatically from 657 to 1029 g on the average
