# An apparatus for reducing noise in audio signals.

## Abstract
In a rotary head magnetic recording and reproducing system of a helical scan type for successively recording and reproducing audio signals in and from record patterns on a magnetic tape, which record patterns are inclined relative to the longitudinal direction of the magnetic tape, by a magnetic head provided on a rotary cylinder, during the successive reproduction of the record patterns by the magnetic head, in order to prevent noise from being contained in a reproduced audio signal which noise is caused by the switching of the record patterns to be reproduced or by the occurrence of a dropout in the reproduced signal, an audio signal is divided into two discrete signals which have a phase difference there between and are transmitted respectively on two separate transmission paths, and two hold circuits 5, 7 10, 11 , each of which is arranged in one of the two transmission paths, are put into operation in synchronism with the switching of the record patterns or the occurrence of the dropout in the reproduced signal, and output signals G, H of the two hold circuits 5, 7 10, 11 are added together thereby to reduce noise contained in the reproduced output audio signal H , L .
