# PISTONLESS ICING DEPOSITOR

## Abstract
An extrusion apparatus includes a rotary shell having plural circumferential rows of extrusion orifices and a stationary inner member, forming in cooperation with the shell recesses communicating with the orifices, and a metering pump for supplying icing to individual passage ways formed in the stationary member, so that precisely metered amounts of icing are extruded through the extru sion orifices, the icing then being cut off by a stationary member which located at a bottom portion of the rotary shell for deposit onto biscuits traveling upon a conveyor belt.
