## Description
The present invention relates to apparatus and methods for determining the dielectric constant and or resistivity of an earth formation in the vicinity of a borehole. High frequency dielectric measurements have been demonstrated as a useful means of determining water saturation in high resistivity earth formations where fresh water and oil zones are difficult to distinguish from one another. Our US patents US A 4012689 US A 4107597 and US A 4107598 describe borehole logging systems comprising three or more coils and operating in the frequency range of from 10 to 60 MHz. While this existing dielectric logging system works well in high resistivity formations, there is also a need to determine water saturation in lower resistivity reservoirs where unknown water salinities often make conventional resistivity based water saturation calculations unusable. An object of the present invention is to provide a borehole logging apparatus and method which permits the obtaining of a more accurate determination of dielectric constant in the case of low resistivity earth formations. US A 4012689 describes apparatus for determining the dielectric constant and or resistivity of an earth formation in the vicinity of a borehole, said apparatus comprising The present invention is characterized in that The present invention also provides a method as set forth in claim 5. Our EP A 121360 is a document of the type described in Article 54 3 of the European Patent Convention. It describes a borehole logging apparatus and method requiring three receivers at three different locations, and determining means to derive signals representative of the secondary electromagnetic fields at two or more of the three locations. Secondary field ratio means preferably derives the ratio of the magnitudes of the secondary electromagnetic fields at the two of said three receiving locations nearest the transmitting means, and phase difference means then derives the phase difference between said signals provided by the respective said receiving means at the two of said three locations furthest away from the transmitting means. US A 3893021 describes a borehole logging apparatus and method requiring the use of two transmitting means at different frequencies, e.g. 16 and 30 MHz, and a single receiving means to acquire the total field at each of the two frequencies. An embodiment of the present invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Our above discussed US A 4012689 US A 4107597 and US A 4107598 describe a logging apparatus referred to hereinafter, and particularly in relation to Figures 1a to 1c, as a conventional apparatus. Certain features and advantages of the present invention, which preferably operates in the 10 to 60 MHz frequency range, have already been described. Another advantage of the present invention is that overshoot on the traces known as horns which occur in lower resistivities when contrast zones are encountered do not occur. The horns normally occur when moving through a high resistivity zone and a low resistivity zone is suddenly encountered. It repeats as the logging tool leaves the low resistivity zone and enters the high resistivity zone again. The horns give an abnormally low reading of the dielectric constants at the boundary. A low dielectric constant reading usually would indicate the possible presence of oil. However, this may not be true because of the horn effect. The present invention eliminates the abnormal horn excursion by using the secondary field ratio in determining the dielectric constant as can be seen in Fig. 1A. The reason for the horns is that using conventional dielectric constant well log techniques the amplitude ratio measurement investigates a larger volume of an earth formation than the phase measurement. As a result, there is a lag between the recording traces. Using the present invention the SFR and phase are looking at essentially the same volume so that there is little or no lag between the SFR trace and the phase trace. This can be seen in Figures 1B and 1C. The aforementioned patented dielectric logging systems use a total field concept. In other words, the signals at each receiver coil consist of contributions from both a primary electromagnetic field and a secondary electromagnetic field. The primary field is that part of the receiver signal which results directly from the electromagnetic field generated by the transmitter coil. The changing electromagnetic field of the transmitter coil also excites eddy currents in the surrounding formation. These eddy currents consist of both conductive and displacement currents. The displacement current density is proportional to the dielectric constant of the surrounding material, while the conductive current density is proportional to the conductivity of the surrounding material. Both the conductive and displacement currents are themselves a source of an electromagnetic field, which is called the secondary field. Thus, the primary field is the field which is detected when the sonde is placed in air with no surrounding material. When the sonde is lowered into a borehole, both the primary field and the secondary field are present at the long spaced It has been discovered that certain advantages can be realized by cancelling the primary field at the receivers and thus making a secondary field measurement. This can be done by adjusting the amplitude of the distant receiver signal until it is equal to the near receiver signal with the sonde in air. One important advantage is the improvement in dielectric constant measurement resolution at low values of formation resistivity. The theoretical crossplot for a conventional dielectric logging sonde is shown in Figure 2. It should be noted that the dielectric constant lines come closer together as the formation resistivity decreases. Achieving an accurate measurement of dielectric constant becomes increasingly difficult as resistivity decreases. The theoretical crossplot for one embodiment of the proposed dielectric logging sonde is shown in Figure 3. The physical coil arrangement for this method would be identical to the present system. Only the measurement means, which is accomplished at the surface, would change. Instead of measuring the amplitude ratio AR of the total field is measured. The secondary field ratio is plotted versus the phase difference to arrive at formation dielectric constant and resistivity values. In Figure 3, it should be noted that the dielectric constant lines do not converge as resistivity decreases. The resulting increases in dielectric resolution at low resistivities is evident. Measurement of the Secondary Field Ratio SFR can be accomplished with the aforementioned patented dielectric constant logging systems with only minor modification. Two methods of measuring the SFR can be employed. The first is an analog method whereby the receiver signals at the surface would be phase shifted, amplified, rectified and applied to an analog divider module. The second method is digital and would use the existing surface unit microprocessor with an additional arithmetic processor to calculate the SFR using equation 2 where SFR is the magnitude of the secondary field ratio and and are the field strength values at the long spaced and short spaced receiver coils, respectively. To achieve a measurement of the secondary field only, equals zero in air. These methods allow one to make the receiver measurements, as in the conventional dielectric constant logging system, and then to calculate the SFR at the surface. The conventional system measures and relative to their values in air. Thus, equation 2 becomes where Solving for the magnitude of 4 yields where and The 1 phase angle results from the phase shift in air between the long and short receivers in the conventional dielectric constant logging sonde. Referring now to Figure 4, a well logging sonde 11 whose main body member is preferably constructed of fiberglass or some other non conductive material of sufficient strength characteristics, is shown suspended by a well logging cable 12 in an uncased well borehole 13 filled with borehole fluid 14 and surrounded by low resistivity earth formations 15 whose dielectric constant and resistivity properties are to be measured. Within the lower portion of the well logging sonde 11 is housed a transmitter electronic section 16 and associated transmitting coil 17. Transmitting coil 17 is a wire wound on a non conducting machinable ceramic material. Transmitting coil 17 is energized at a frequency within a preferred range of 10MHz to 60MHz, preferably at a frequency of 20MHz as hereinafter described. Coil 17, when so energized, transmits electromagnetic energy into earth formations 15. Receiver coils 22 and 23 which are helically wound on machinable ceramic forms comprise tuned resonant circuits which are sensitive to the transmitting frequency, i.e. the preferred frequency of 20MHz. Receiver coils 22 and 23 are located 60,96 cm and 101,60 cm 24 and 40 inches , respectively, from transmitter coil 17 in sonde 11. Transmitter coil 17 and receiver coils 22 and 23 are electrostatically shielded as indicated by the dotted line boxes around the coils. The coil types and spacings just recited are intended as being illustrative only and it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that other operating frequencies in the range of interest for practicing the invention and other coil types and spacings than these may be used without departing from the inventive concept. Transmitter section 16 includes a transmitter 30 which may be in an off state, a low power operational state, or a high power operational state as determined by an operator. Transmitter 30 is used to energize transmitter coil 17. Transmitter section 16 includes also transmitter mode select means 32 which provides a control signal to transmitter 30, to control the state of transmitter 30, in response from a signal from a photo detector and amplifier 34. Transmitter 30 is energized by DC voltage from battery 36. An operator at the surface determines the transmitter mode and provides, as hereinafter explained, a modulated signal down well logging cable 12 to a demodulator 40 located in the upper section of sonde 11 which demodulates the signal and provides it to a light emitting diode 44. Light emitting diode 44 provides a corresponding light output through a fiber optic cable 46 which passes through coils 23, 22 and 17 and is then converted back into an electrical signal by photo detector and amplifier 34 located in transmitter section 16. The purpose of using fiber optic cabling is to allow the state of transmitter 30 to be controlled without creating electromagnetic interference in receiver coils 22 and 23. The signals from coils 22 and 23 are provided to amplifiers 48 and 49, respectively, of receiver electronics 54. The outputs of receiver amplifiers 48 and 49 are provided to RF mixers 66 and 67, respectively, where the 20MHz signals are heterodyned to a lower frequency, preferably 1 kilohertz, by action of a local oscillator 73. An automatic frequency control circuit 75 maintains the intermediate frequency locked to the frequency of 1 kilohertz reference signal provided by a 1 kilohertz reference source 78. The outputs of mixers 66 and 67 are provided to voltage controlled oscillators 83 and 84, respectively, which converts the mixers signals to frequency modulated signals. Voltage controlled oscillators 83 and 84 provide frequency modulated signals having carrier frequencies of 20 and 45 kilohertz, respectively. These carrier frequencies were chosen to provide adequate separation of the modulated carriers to allow for low pass and high pass filtering at the surface and further to fall within the maximum transmission capability of the logging cable. The frequency modulated signals provided by voltage controlled oscillators 83 and 84 are provided to summing amplifier means 90 where they are summed and provided to a cable driver 92. Cable driver 92 provides the sum signal from summing means 90 to cable 12 which conducts it uphole to the surface electronics 100 on the surface. As noted earlier, transmitter 30 may be in any one of three states. The transmitter operational state is selected at the surface to allow high power operation of transmitter 16 only while actual logging and calibrations are in process. This permits the standard battery pack to operate within its power capabilities while providing a factor of 10 increase in transmitter input power during logging. Transmitter 30 state is selected by sending a dual tone signal from tone generator 105 of surface electronics 100 to cable 12 where it is conducted downhole to demodulator 40 in sonde 11. As explained previously in the discussion of transmitter section 16, the signals are then conveyed to photo detector 34 via fiber optic cable and thence to transmitter mode select 32 which controls the mode of transmitter 30. Surface electronics 100 also includes a low pass filter 110 and a high pass filter 112 which filters the signal from cable 12 to provide reproductions of the signals from voltage control oscillators 84 and 83, respectively, to phase locked loop demodulators 120 and 122, respectively. The output of phase locked loop demodulators 120 and 122 are reproductions of the signals provided by receiver coils 23 and 22, respectively, each signal having a frequency of 1 kilohertz. The signals from phase locked loop demodulators 120 and 122 are provided to phase means 130 which provide a signal representative of the phase differences between the signals received by coils 22 and 23. Phase locked loop demodulators 120 and 122 provide their output signals also to rectifier means 154 and 154A, respectively. The output of phase means 130 and rectifier means 154 and 154A are provided to an analog input output means 168. Analog input output means 168 provides them as digital signals to microprocessor means 170. Analog input output means 168 receives pulses from sheave wheel 150 and provides corresponding digital signals to microprocessor means 170 where depth shifting of data may be done if so desired. Microprocessor means 170 provides digital signals to analog input output means 168, representative of the dielectric constant and of the resistivity of the earth formations, which in turn provides analog signals. The signals from rectifier means 154 and 154A, from phase means 130, and from analog input output means 168 are provided to amplifiers 155A, 155B, 155C, 155D, and 155E, which amplify the signals and provides them to recorder means 149. Microprocessor means 170 performs the calculation of SFR and then uses this value together with the phase difference to calculate the dielectric constant value in accordance with aforementioned equations. Microcomputer means 170 combines the SFR data calculated from the electromagnetic fields at coils 22 and 23 with the phase difference data measured between coils 22 and 23. This is done by programming microcomputer means 170 to interpret the crossplot shown in Figure 3. This crossplot relates the measured values of SFR and phase difference to the formation electrical parameters of resistivity and dielectric constant. The crossplot represents the solution of the Helmholtz wave equation in a cylindrical geometry for the coils spacings, frequency and borehole parameters chosen. The phase measurement is depth shifted by microcomputer means 170 to align the two measure points vertically. The present invention hereinbefore described uses secondary field ratio measurements as well as a phase shift measurement to determine the resistivity and dielectric constant of low resistivity formations.
