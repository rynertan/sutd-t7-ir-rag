# Cap heat sealing apparatus for containers.

## Abstract
A cap heat sealing apparatus for containers comprises a stationary pressing member 18 , and movable pressing members 19 arranged around the stationary pressing member 18 and identical in number to the number of corners of a container opening fitting portion 8 of a poly gonal cap 5 formed at its periphery for heat sealing. The stationary pressing member 18 has an outer periphery shaped in conformity with the shape of the inner periphery of the fitting portion 8 . Each of the movable pressing mem bers 19 is movable toward or away from the stationary pressing member 18 in a horizontal direction through the center of the stationary pressing member 18 and the cor ner thereof opposed to the movable pressing member 19 . Each movable pressing member 19 has a pressing face V shaped when seen from above to conform with an outer peripheral portion of the stationary pressing member 18 including one corner thereof so that when the movable pressing members 19 are brought toward the stationary pressing member 18 , the pressing faces thereof are com bined to conform with the entire outer periphery of the member 18 .
