# FOOD PROCESSOR

## Abstract
A large feed tube 52 extending from the cover 30 of the container 18 of a food processor may be partly obstructed by a safety guard 64 on a wing element 58, which is pivotable between an open position in which the feed tube is unobstructed and the processor cannot operate and a closed position in which a safety switch 70 is actuated via a tongue 68 to allow operation. Thus, even though large vegetables can be inserted in the open position and then processed, it is not possible to insert a human hand in the feed tube when the processor is operating.
