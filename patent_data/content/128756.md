# Transfer apparatus.

## Abstract
The transfer apparatus comprises a transfer arm 16 and a distributor 18 . The transfer arm has two axes of movement 22, 26 and is non extendable so that it moves between a take off station and an intermediate station I through a fixed distance. The distributor 18 has a table 50 which receives a shoe S at the intermediate station I . Furthermore, the table 50 can be positioned at any one of four stations I, F1, F2, F3 each aligned with a channel 12 of a heat setting apparatus 14 . A pneumatic control circuit causes shoes S fed succes sively to the table 50 to be transferred in a sequence to the channels 12 by operation of pusher means 68 . The apparatus is suitable for transferring shoes from a last ing machine, a shoe support 10 of which can be positioned at the take off station, to a hest setting apparatus 14 .
