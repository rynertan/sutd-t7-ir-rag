# Vehicle suspension system.

## Abstract
A suspension system 16a for a vehicle 12a is com posed of wheels 18, 19 that are mounted on wheel mounting members 20 journed within upright axle carriers 24 on opposite sides of a body 14 . Spring assemblies 114, 116 are mounted either directly on the wheel mounting members 20 or on lower trailing arms 62 at locations closely adjacent axle carriers 24 , with the upper ends of the spring assemblies connected to overhead portions 120 of body 14 for supporting substantially the entire weight of the body directly on the wheel mounting members. A pair of upper and lower trailing arms 60, 62 are pivotally mounted on axle carriers 24 while the opposite ends of the trailing arms are pivotally connected to upright members 72a . A tie assembly 84 extends transversely across body 14 to pivotally interconnect with the lower portions of upright members 72a . The central portions of tie assembly 84 is pivotally connected to body 14 at a roll axis 92 located above the center of gravity 94 of the body. The outer ends of a pair of upper, generally transverse link members 100, 102 are pivotally connected to the upper end portions of upright members 72a while the inward ends of the link members are pivotally connected to the vehicle body 14 at locations above roll axis 92 .
