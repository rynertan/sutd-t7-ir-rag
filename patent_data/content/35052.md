# Method of treating tobacco extracts employing electrodialysis.

## Abstract
A process for denitrating tobacco with minimal losses of desirable tobacco solubles employing electrodialysis is disclosed. The process comprises subjecting an aqueous tobacco extract to membrane electrodialysis such that nitrate salts are extracted, without substantial loss of desir able tobacco solubles. The denitrated extract when com bined with denitrated insoluble fibrous tobacco materials may be employed to produce tobacco products having reduced nitrogen oxide delivery.
