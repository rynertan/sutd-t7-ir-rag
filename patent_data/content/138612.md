# Barrier laminates for containment of essential oils and flavours and cartons made therefrom.

## Abstract
A laminate providing an effective barrier to the migration of essential oils and or flavourings, such as d limonene, there through is provided comprising, from the outer surface to the inner surface, a paperboard substrate 10 , a web 12 of pro pylene polymer coated thereon and a web of olefin polymer 14 overlying the propylene polymer web 12 . Preferably the paperboard substrate 10 is also coated on the external surface thereof with a web 16 of heat sealable olefin polymer. Containers constructed from such laminates are especially useful as fruit juice containers which enable significant flavour retention in the fruit juice contained therein over the normal shelf life of the product.
