A number of substituted imidazolidinones are known which are said to display selective herbicidal activity. Krenzer, in U.S. Patent No. 4,093,443, describes certain 2 thiadiazolyli idazolidinones which are allegedly useful as herbicides. Similar thiadiazolylimidazolidinone compounds are disclosed by Krenzer in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,904,640, 3,944,409, 3,963,473, 3,964,895, 3,984,228, 3,990,882, 4,018,787, 4,021,439, 4,028,375, 4,063,924, and 4,097,486. Imidazolidinones bearing an isoxazolyl moiety are heretofore unknown. The compounds provided by the present invention are imidazolidinone derivatives which require an isoxazojyl substituent at the 3 or 5 position. According to the present invention there is provided an isoxazolylimidazolidinone of the formula IEMI1.1 wherein RÚ is C1 C6 alkyl Rê is hydrogen, or taken together with R4 is a double bond R3 is hydrogen or C1 C6 alkyl R4 is hydroxy, C1 C6 alkanoyloxy, or take together with Rê is a double bond R5 is hydrogen, halo, cyano, nitro, or C1 C6 alkyl and R6 is hydrogen, C1 C6 alkyl, trifluoromethyl,C1 C3 alkoxy C1 C6 alkyl, C C7 cycloalkyl, or C1 C3 alkyl substituted C3 C7 cycloalkyl. There is also provided a herbicidal formulation which comprises as active ingredient from 1.0 to 90.08 by weight of an isoxazolylimidazolidinone of the formula I as before defined associated with at least one carrier or diluent therefor. There is also provided a process for prepar ing an isoxazolylimidazolidinone of the formula I as before described which ccmprises a dyclising a dialkoxy ethyl isoxazolylurea of the formula IIEMI2.1 wherein R1, R3, R5 and R6 are as above described and X and Y independently are C1 CX alkoxy to obtain a compound of formula I in which R4 is hydroxy, b dehydrating a compound of formula I, in which R4 is hydroxy, to obtain a compound of formula I in which R4 together with R2 signify a double bond, or c acylating a compound of formula I, in which R4 is hydroxy, to obtain a compound of formula I in which R4 is C1 C6 alkanoyloxy. There is also provided a method of inhibiting the growth of weeds which comprises applying to the Typical C3 C7 cycloalkyl groups are cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl and cycloheptyl. A C1 C3 alkyl substituted C3 C7 cycloalkyl group is one of the recited cycloalkyl groups which is monosubstituted with a C1 C3 alkyl group such as methyl, ethyl and propyl. It is preferred that the C1 C3 alkyl substituent group be attached at the 1 position of the cycloalkyl group. Typical of such preferred groups are l methylcyclopentyl, 1 methylcyclohexyl, l ethylcycloheptyl, l n propylcyclobutyl and the like. The term halo as used herein refers to fluoro, chloro, bromo and iodo. Preferred halo groups include chloro and bromo.. Most of the isoxazolylimidazolidinone derivatives provided by this invention are prepared by cyclization of a suitably substituted 3 or 5 isoxa zyolyiurea of the formula TI EMI3.1 wherein RÚ, Rê, R5 and R6 are as defined above, and X and Y are C1 C6 alkoxy such as methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy or the like. The cyclization of the di alkoxy isoxazolylurea intermediate can be accomplished by simply heating the intermediate in the presence of an acid. Commonly used acids include mineral acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, phosphoric, nitric, and related acids. Organic acids such as acetic acid can also be utilized if desired. The amount of acid commonly employed to effect the cyclization is about an equimolar amount or an excess, and routinely the reaction is simply carried out in a dilute aqueous acid solution having an acid concentration of about 0.5 to about 5 percent by weight. If desired, the cyclization reaction can be carried out in a solvent medium other than water, such as dioxane, dimethylsulfoxide, dimethylformamide, and the like, with an equimolar or excess amount of suitable acid added.The cyclization reaction generally is substantially complete within about 10 to about 90 minutes when carried out at an elevated temperature of about 40 to about 1000C. The reaction provides an isoxazolyl 4 hydroxyimidazolidinone i.e. an imidazolidinone wherein R4 is hydroxy which is readily isolated by cooling the reaction mixture, for instance to 0 to about 5 C., and then collecting the precipitate.The precipitated isoxazolyl 4 hydroxyimidazolidinone can be further purified if desired by conventional means, including chromatography and crystallization from common solvents such as ethanol, acetone, dioxane, water and the like Examples of isoxazolyl 4 hydroxyimidazoli dinones which are readily prepared according to the above described cyclization process include the following 3 4 cyano 3 isoxazolyl 4 hydroxy l ethyl 2 imidazolidinone 3 4,5 diethyl 3 isoxazolyl 4 hydroxy 1methyl 2 imidazolidinone 3 4 isopropyl 3 isoxazolyl 4 hydroxy l n butyl 2 imidazolidinone 3 5 isopropyl 3 isoxazolyl 4 hydroxyl n butyl 2 imidazolidinone 3 3 trifluoromethyl 5 isoxazolyl 4 hydroxyl methyl 2 imidazolidinone 3 3 ethyl 4 nitro 5 isoxazolyl 4 hydroxy l ethyl 2 imidazolidinone 3 5 cyclohexyl0 3 isoxazolyl 4 hydroxy 1methyl 2 imidazolidinone 3 3 tert. butyl 4 cyano 5 isoxazolyl 4 hydroxy l n propyl 2 imidazolidinone 3 5 1 ethyl 1 methylpropyl 3 isoxazolyl 4 hydroxy l methyl 2 imidazolidinone 3 3 1 ethyl 1 methylpropyl 5 isoxazolyl 4 hydroxy l ethyl 2 imidazolidinone 3 3 methoxymethyl 4 bromo 5 isoxazolyl 4 hydroxy l ethyl 2 imidazolidinone and 3 4 cyano 5 tert. butyl 3 isoxazolyl 4 hydroxy l n hexyl 2 imidazolidinone. The isoxazolyl 4 hydroxyimidazolidinones thus described are useful not only as herbicides, but also as intermediates in the synthesis of other imidazolidinones of the invention. For example, the unsaturated imidazolinones of the invention, i.e. compounds of the above formula wherein R2 and R4 together form a double bond, are preferably prepared by dehydrating a 4hydroxyimidazolidinone according to the following sequence EMI6.1 Such dehydration can be effected by reacting the 4hydroxyimidazolidinone with an acid such as a mineral acid, or preferably with an equimolar amount or slight excess of a halogenating agent such as thionyl chloride.For example, reaction of a compound such as 3 5 tert. butyl 3 isoxazolyl 4 hydroxy l ethyl 2 imida zolidinone with about an equimolar amount of thionyl chloride in a solvent such as chloroform or methylene chloride for about 1 to about 24 hours at a temperature of about 0 to about 500C. provides the corresponding unsaturated imidazolinone, namely 3 5 tert. butyl 3 isoxazolyl l ethyl 2 imidazolinone. The product can be recovered by simply removing the reaction solvent, for instance by evaporation, and further purification can be achieved if desired by routine procedures such as crystallization from common solvents such acetone or diethyl ether. The isoxazolyl 4 hydroxy imidazolidinones of this invention are also useful in the preparation of those imidazolidinones of the above general formula wherein R4 is C1 C6 alkanoyloxy. For example, the isoxazolyl 4 hydroxy imidazolidinones of the invention are readily acylated with an acylating agent such as an acid halide. Commonly used acylating agents include acetyl chloride, butyryl iodide, hexanoyl bromide, and the like. Other acylating agents commonly employed include anhydrides such as acetic anhydride, acetic formic anhydride, propanoic formic anhydride, and the like. The acylation of an isoxazolyl 4 hydroxyimidazolidinone can be accomplished by reacting about equimolar quantities of a 4 hydroxyimidazolidinone and an acylating agent. An excess of acylating agent can be employed if desired. The reaction typically is conducted in a solvent such as benzene, acetone, dichloromethane, chloroform, or the like, and routinely is carried out in the presence of a base to act as an acid scavenger. Commonly used bases include triethylamine, pyridine, sodium carbonate, and the like. The acylation reaction is generally substantially complete after about 2 to about 24 hours when carried out at a temperature of about 20 to about 800C. The acylated product, namely an isoxazolylimidazolidinone of the 4.above formula wherein R is C1 C6 alkanoyloxy, can be isolated by simply removing the reaction solvent, for instance by evaporation under reduced pressure. The acylated imidazolidinone can be purified if needed by conventional means, including washing with dilute acid and dilute base, chromatography, crystallization, and the like. Typical compounds comprehended by this invention which are conveniently prepared by acylation or dehydration of a 4 hydroxy imidazolidinone include the following 3 5 tert. butyl 3 isoxazolyl 4 acetoxyl n propyl 2 imidazolidinone 3 5 methoxymethyl 3 isoxazolyl 4 acetoxy1 1,1 dimethylpropyl 2 imidazolidione 3 3 2 methoxypentyl 5 isoxazolyl 4 n butyroxy 5 ethyl l methyl 2 imidazolidinone 3 5 tert. butyl 3 isoxazolyl 4 propionoxy 1 1,1 dimethylbutyl 2 imidazolidinone 3 4 cyano 3 isoxazolyl 4 acetoxy 1isopropyl 2 imidazolidinone 3 5 cycloheptyl 3 isoxazolyl 4 acetoxy 1ethyl 2 imidazolidinone 3 5 isobutyl 3 isoxazolyl 4 acetoxy l methyl 2 imidazolidinone 3 4 nitro 5 sec. butyl 3 isoxazolyl 4 propionoxy 5 methyl l ethyl 2 imidazolidinone 3 5 isoxazolyl 4 acetoxy 1 n butyl 2imidazolidinone 3 3 trifluoromethyl 5 isoxazolyl 4 nbutyroxy l ethyl 2 imidazolidinone 3 5 methoxymethyl 3 isoxazolyl 4 formyloxyl tert. butyl 2 imidazolidinone 3 4 chloro 5 ethyl 3 isoxazolyl 4 propion oxy 5 ethyl l n propyl 2 imidazolidinone 3 5 isobutyl 3 isoxazolyl 4 acetoxy 1 2 methylpentyl 2 imidazolidinone 3 3 methyl 5 isoxazolyl 4 n butyroxy 5 ethyl 1 1,1 dimethylpropyl 2 imidazolidione 3 5 tert. butyl 3 isoxazolyl 1 ethyl 2 imidazolinone 3 4,5 diethyl 3 isoxazolyl l methyl 2 imidazolinone 3 3 1 ethylcyclopentyl 5 isoxazolyl 1 methyl 2 imidazolinone 3 5 methoxymethyl 3 isoxazolyl 1 methyl 2 imidazolinone and 3 4 bromo 5 isopropoxymethyl 3 isoxazolyl 5 methyl 1 1,1 dimethylpropyl 2 imdiazolinone. As pointed out earlier, the isoxazolylimidazolidinone derivatives of this invention require, as an initial starting material, an isoxazolylurea of the formula IIEMI9.1 wherein X and Y are C1 C alkoxy groups such as methoxy, ethoxy or the like. The isoxazolylurea intermediates can be prepared by any of several procedures. In a typical procedure, a 3 or 5 aminoisoxazole is reacted with a haloformate such as phenyl chloroformate to give an isoxazolyl carbamate, which when reacted with a suitably substituted ethylamine gives the isoxazolylurea of the invention. Such procedure can be illustrated by the following sequence EMI10.1 The 3 or 5 aminoisoxazoles, wherein R5 and R6 are as defined above, are known in the art or are available by art known methods.Similarly, the dialkoxy ethylamines of the formula R1NHCH R3 CHXY are well known in the art and some are commercially available. The reaction of a haloformate such as phenyl chloroformate and a 3 or 5 aminoisoxazole generally is carried out by combining an excess of haloformate with the isoxazole in an organic solvent such as pyridine or triethylamine, and stirring the mixture for about 1 to about 24 hours at a temperature of about 0 to about 300C. The product of the reaction, an isoxazolyl carbamate, is generally isolated by acidifying the reaction mixture, for instance by the addition of a mineral acid such as hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid, and collecting by filtration the precipitate which forms. The carbamate normally needs no further purification, but if desired it can be crystallized from common solvents such as benzene, acetone, ethyl acetate and the like. The isoxazolyl carbamate thus formed is next reacted with an N alkyl 2,2 dialkoxy ethylamine derivative. Typical ethylamines commonly employed includeN methyl 2, 2 dimethoxyethylamine, N ethyl 2,2 diethoxyethylamine, N isobutyl l methyl 2 ethoxy 2 methoxyethylamine, N I, 1 dimethylpropyl l n hexyl 2 methoxy 2 hexyloxyethylamine, and the like. The isoxazolyl carbamate and the ethylamine generally are combined in a mutual organic solvent such as toluene or benzene. The reactants can be utilized in about equimolar amounts, or if desired the ethylamine derivative can be employed in excess. The reaction routinely is substantially complete within about 2 to about 5 hours when carried out at a temperature of about 50 to about 1000C. Isolation of the product, an isoxazolylurea intermediate of the invention, usually is accomplished by simply removing the reaction solvent, for instance by evaporation under reduced pressure. The isoxazolylurea can be further purified if needed by routine methods, including recrystallization and chromatography. An alternative procedure for preparing the isoxazolylurea intermediates of the invention comprises reacting a suitably substituted N alkyl 2,2 dialkoxy ethylamine derivative with a 3 or 5 isoxazolyl isocyanate. The isoxazolyl isocyanate is conveniently prepared by reacting a 3 or 5 aminoisoxazole with phosgene in the presence of an acid such as hydrochloric acid to give the corresponding 3 or 5 chlorocarbonylaminoisoxazole. The latter compound undergoes dehydrohalogenation in situ to provide the correspondingtisoxazolyl isocyanate. The reaction of the isocyanate with an ethylamine derivative is illustrated by the following sequence EMI12.1 wherein R1, R5, R51 R , X and Y are all as heretofore defined.The reaction of an ethylamine with an isoxazolyl isocyanate generally is carried out by combining approximately equimolar quantities of the reactants in a suitable solvent such as benzene or toluene. The reaction normally is complete within about 2 to about 5 hours when carried out at a temperature of about 50 to about 1000C. Isolation of the product generally is achieved by simply removing the reaction solvent by evaporation under reduced pressure.Further purification, if needed, can be accomplished by crystallization, chromatography or similar conventional methods. The preparation of typical isoxazolylurea intermediates and isoxazolylimidazolidinone derivatives is illustrated by the following working examples.

The isoxazolylimidazolidinone derivatives provided by this invention exhibit both terrestrial and aquatic herbicidal and plant growth regulator activity, and accordingly are useful in the control and elimination of unwanted vegetative growth. The compounds are nontoxic to a number of beneficial terrestrial plants, including cotton, corn, soybean, wheat, rice, barley, oats, peanuts and related crops raised for both human and domestic animal consumption.The herbicides of the invention are effective terres trially in both pre emergent and early post emergent control of a wide variety of grasses and broadleaf weeds. Commonly encountered unwanted terrestrial vegetation which is subject to control with the herbicidal isoxazolylimidazolidinones and isoxazolylimidazolinones of this invention include annuals such as pigweed, lambsquarter, wild oats, velvetleaf, ryegrass, goose grass, crabgrass, foxtail, chickweed, barnyardgrass, smartweed, knotweed, cocklebur, kochia, medic, ragweed, hemp nettle, spurge, jungle rice, morningglory, ducksalad, cheatgrass, fall panicum, jimsonweed, watergrass, spangletop, and the like.Biennials subject to control include wild carrot, wild barley, burdock, bull thistle, houndstongue, and purple star thistle. Other common weeds which can be controlled with the herbicides of this invention include perennial ryegrass, quackgrass, Johnson grass, sheep sorrell, grass, field chickweed, dandelion, RussianKnotweed, horsetail, sesbania, cattail, wintercress, nutsedge, milkweed, sicklepod, and related weeds. The pre emergent and post emergent terrestrial herbicidal activity of several isoxazolylimidazolidinone derivatives of this invention has been determined in standard greenhouse experiments. Such experiments were carried out by first formulating a test compound for convenient soil surface or overtop foliar spray application. The test compound was formulated by dissolving 0.2 percent by weight in a solution containing 4.0 percent by weight acetone, 4.0 percent by weight ethanol, and 91.7 percent by weight of deionized water, and 0.1 percent by weight of a commercial surfactant, for example Toximul R and S, which are blends of anionic and nonionic surface active agents StepanChemical Co. Northfield, Illinois, 60093 .The solution containing the test compound was then serially diluted with deionized water to the appropriate volume con taining the desired concentration of test compound.The formulated compounds were applied pre emergence and cr post emergence to metal greenhouse flats filled with soil and seeded to test plants. The compounds were evaluated at several application rates, initially at 15 pounds per acre 16.8 kg ha and at lower rates until compound activity diminished. Pre emergence applications were made to the soil surface of the seeded flats. Post emergence applications were made to the foliage of the various plant species approximately twelve days after seeding. All treated flats were maintained in a greenhouse following treatment. Evaluations of compound activity were made in the form of plant injury rating on a scale of 1 to 5. The rating of 1 refers to no plant injury 2 slight injury 3 moderate injury 4 severe injury and 5 death to all treated plants.Evaluations were made from 11 to 14 days after post emergence application, and from 18 to 21 days following pre emergence application.

SEP 5 SEP 5 tb The data presented in Table 1 demonstrates that 3 5 1,1 dimethylethyl 3 isoxazolyl 4 hydroxy l methyl 2 imidazolidinone is effective both as a preemergence and a post emergence terrestrial herbicide at rates as low as 0.25 pounds per acre 0.28 kg ha against weeds such as velvetleaf, zinnia, wildoat, foxtail, pigweed and lambsquarter, while having no or only slight adverse affect on desirable plants such as corn, cotton and soybean. The data presented in Table 2 demonstrates that the compound tested, while somewhat less active than that of Table 1, nevertheless is an excellent preemergence herbicide at rates as low as 2 pounds per acre 2.7 kg ha against commonly occurring terrestrial weeds such as lambsquarter and velvetleaf, while displaying little or no toxic affects to desirable plants such as corn, wheat, rice, alfalfa and the like. Similarly, the data of Table 4 shows that a 3 5 isoxazolyl lmidazolidinone is toxic both pre and post emergence at rates as low as 0.25 pound per acre 0.28 kg ha against weeds such as lambsquarter, crabgrass, and pigweed, while having little or no adverse affect on corn, cotton, soybean, rice, or the like. The data thus far generated indicates that compounds embraced by this invention are useful as selective terrestrial herbicides against common weed varities which are found in desirable crops such as corn, wheat, soybean, and the like. The compounds can also be used in a chemical fallow program, for example in a fallow wheatland weed control program. Because of the potent terrestrial herbicidal activity possessed by the isoxazolylimidazolidinone derivatives of this invention, they are useful in the elimination and control of the growth of unwanted terrestrial vegetation. The invention therefore further provides a herbicidal method for controlling the growth of unwanted terrestrial vegetation which comprises applying to the plants or to the locus where vegetative control is desired a herbicidally effective amount of an isoxazolylimidazolidinone derivative of this invention as defined above. The practice of such method can be carried out by applying the herbicidal compounds by any of several art recognized methods.The compounds can be surface applied to soil prior to planting of crops or emergence of seedlings. If desired, the surface applied herbicide can be incorporated into the soil by conventional means. The compounds can alternatively be applied early postemergence, for instance within about 2 weeks following seedling emergence. The amount of herbicidal isoxazolylimidazolidinone derivatives to be employed in the method cf this invention is an amount which is effective in controlling the growth of unwanted vegetation. Such herbicidal amount will depend upon a number of factors, including the method of application, formulation, soil texture, soil moisture content, the expected population of unwanted vegetation, degree of incorporation, the extent of growth control desired, and related factors.The rate of application normally will be from about 0.01 to about 10.0 pounds per acre, and preferably from about 0.25 to about 5.0 pounds per acre. These ranges are equivalent, respectively, to from about 0.011 to about 11.2 kilograms per hectare, and from about 0.28 to about 5.6 kilograms per hectare. The isoxazolylimidazolidinone and isoxazolylimidazolinone herbicides to be employed according to the terrestrial method of this invention can be formulated for convenient application as aqueous sprays, drenches, solid powders, dusts and the like. Herbicidal formulations containing an isoxazolylimidazolidinone derivative as defined herein are provided in a further embodiment of this invention. Such formulations will contain from about 1.0 to about 90 percent by weight of active isoxazolylimidazolidinone derivative, and can be prepared by combining an isoxazolylimidazolidinone derivative with any number of common herbicidal carriers, diluents, adjuvants and the like.The formulations can contain liquid carriers and adjuvants such as organic solvents, including benzene, xylene, toluene, a halotoluene such as ortho chlorotoluene, n hexane, npentane, kerosene, and similar organic solvents. The formulations can additionally contain art known emulsifiers, stabilizers, dispersants, suspending agents, spreaders, penetrants, wetting agents and the like. Typical carriers utilized in the dry formulations of the invention include clay, talc, diatomaceous earth, silica, pyrophyllite and the like. Herbicidal dusts are prepared by grinding and blending such solid carriers with a compound of the invention such as 3 S tert. butyl 3 isoxazo yl 4 hydroxy 5 ethyl 1 methyl 2 imidazolidinone. Granular formulations provided herein are prepared by impregnating an isoxazolylimidazolidinone derivative onto or into a granulated carrier such as a vermiculite. Such granules typically have a particle size of about 0.2 to about 2.0 mm. Preferred formulations of the inventions are in the form of wettable powders. Such formulations employ any number of commercially available wetting agents, surfactants and emulsifying agents such as ethoxylated nonyl phenols, ethoxylated octyl phenols, polyoxyethylene stearyl ethers, blends of such agents, and the like. Such formulations can optionally contain adjuvants such as thickening agents, for instance heteropolysaccharide gums and the like such as xanthan gum, as well as antibacterial agents such as aqueous formaldehyde. The following detailed examples of formulations illustrate preferred aspects of the inyention. Example 18 Granule Percent byIngredient Weight 3 5 isopropyl 3 isoxa zolyl 4 hydroxy l ethyl2 imidazolidinone 5.0 clay 95.0 100.0 percent The isoxazolylimidazolidinone herbicide is substantially dissolved in acetone or similar solvent, and the organic solution is sprayed onto the clay chips. The mixture is thoroughly blended and dried.

The dust may be applied directly to the locus of weed infestation. Example 20 Wettable Powder Percent byIngredient Weight 3 3 tert. butyl 5 isoxazolyl 4 hydroxy l methyl 2 imidazolidinone 50.0Fuller s earth 47.0 methyl cellulose 0.5 sodium lauryl sulfate 2.5 100.0 The above ingredients are blended te uniformity and dispersed in water to the desired concentration of active ingredient. The herbicidal isoxazolylimidazolidinone derivatives of this invention can be employed in combination with other herbicides for the effective control of an even broader spectrum of weeds. Well known herbicides which may be utilized together with the herbicides of this invention include diuron, atrazine, trifluralin, metribuzin, simazine, propazine, paraquat, and the like. Combinations of the compounds of this invention together with herbicides which are especially effective against grasses are particularly preferred. Typical of such combinations is trifluralin and a compound such as 3 4 tert. butyl 5 isoxazolyl l ethyl 2 imidazolinone. It is contemplated that such combinations will contain the respective herbicides in approximately equal amounts, and that upon application each respective herbicide will be present at about 0.1 to about 5.0 pounds per acre 0.112 to about 5.6 kg ha . The isoxazolylimidazolidinones of this invention also are useful in the control of unwanted vegetation in a chemical fallow program, for instance in the control of lambsquarter, morningglory, velvetleaf, and similar weeds in fallow wheatland. Combinations with herbicides such as atrazine and tri fluralin are particularly useful in a fallow program. The compounds defined herein also are useful in regulating the growth pattern of plant life without causing total elimination. In order to achieve such plant growth regulation, the compounds are employed in amounts which are effective to cause growth regulation but are not herbicidal. The compounds are applied directly to the plants or to the locus where the plants to be regulated are growing. The compounds are p ef errably formulated for post emergence over the top spray application. Typical manifestations of plant growth regulation employing compounds of this invention include control of flowering, control of fruiting, delay in maturation, reduction in stem growth, improvements in yield, and related regulatory responses. The plant growth regulating properties of the compounds defined herein have been determined by the following test procedure. Test compounds were formulated as a foliar spray by dissolving 50 mg. in 25 ml.of Toximul R and Toximul S 50 50 . An aliquot of the solution was further diluted to a concentration of test compound of 1000 parts per million ppm . The formulated test compound was sprayed onto the leaves of squash and bean plants, and the plants were then allowed to dry for two hours. All leaves were then removed from the treated plants, and the plants were placed in a greenhouse. Evaluations for terminal growth and morphological effects were made after fie days.Growth regulator activity is rated on a scale of 3 to 3. A indicates growth promotion, while a indicates growth inhibition. The numerical ratings are assigned the meanings 0 no effect 1 slight response 2 moderate response 3 distinct response.Phytotoxicity is indicated according to the following scale B burn C chlorosis X death The results of this plant growth regulator test are presented in Table 13 which follows Table 13Plant Growth Regulator ActivitySquash BeanCompound of Concentration Growth Phyto Growth PhytoExample No. ppm Rating toxicity Rating Toxicity 1 1000 0 2C 3 3C 2 1000 1 1C 3X 3B 3 1000 3 0CX 4 1000 3 1C 3X 3X 5 1000 1 0C 8 1000 1 0C 3B 3B 10 1000 0 0 0 0 11 1000 1 1C The compounds provided by this invention also have demonstrated useful activity as aquatic algicides, aquatic growth regulators and aquatic herbicides.A further embodiment of this invention therefore is a method for controlling aquatic plant growth which involves applying an effective amount of a compound as defined herein to the aquatic plants to be controlled or to the water in which the plants are growing. The compounds of the invention have been evaluated in a standard aquatic algicide test designed to show algicidal activity. In a primary screen, the compounds were evaluated against Chlorella vulgaris,Scenedesmus auadricanda, and Anacystis nidulans. These algae species were grown on agar slants containing artificial media Hughes media . The agar slants were employed in the inoculation of the test media, which itself is an aqueous Hughes media. Five milliliters of sterile Hughes media is used to wash the agar slants, and this is then added to 400 ml. of sterileHughes media. Two milliliters of the inoculated media is then added to each of several 12 ml. disposable vials. The test compounds are formulated for evaluation by dissolving 10 mg. of compound in a solution of 0.5 ml. acetone and 4.5 mlX of sterile 0.1 aqueous polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate Tween 80 . Aliquot portions of the formulated test compounds are then added to the vials containing the various algae species.Visual observations and comparisons to non treated control vials were made 7 days after treatment. Activity ratings were made on a scale of 1 to 5 according to the following meanings 1 no effect 2 slight effect 3 moderate effect 4 heavy effect 5 100 control. Table 14 which follows presents the algicidal activity of compounds of.the invention evaluated according to the foregoing procedure.

The following method was used in the laboratory to evaluate the aquatic growth regulating properties of the compounds disclosed herein. The compounds for this test were formulated in the following manner. Twenty milligrams of compound was weighed into a 12 ml. disposable vial. To the vial containing the compound were added 1 ml. of acetone and 9 ml. of aqueous 0.1 percent polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate Tween 80 . This solution was then diluted with appropriate volumes of water to obtain solutions containing 10, 1, 0.5 and 0.25 ppm parts per million of test compound. Terminal pieces of Florida elodea, Hydrilla verticillata L.F. , hereinafter identified as hydrilla 10 cm. long, without branching, were prepared for testing. Three such cuttings were placed in each plastic container holding 785 ml. of water containing the formulated test compound and 3 ml. of Hoagland s nutrient solution. Three 10 cm. cuttings of hydrilla were placed in each of several control containers of water. To the water in each control container there was also added the amount of solvent used to formulate the test compound for each container. After a period of two to three weeks, measurements were made to determine the total length of each plant. An average total growth was obtained by dividing the total combined lengths by the number of replicates. By subtracting 10 cm. from the average total length, the average increase in growth was obtained. This difference was divided by the average increase in length of the plants in the solvent controls SC and the quotient multiplied by 100 to give a percent inhibition.

Water hyacinth is a floating aquatic plant of the order Eichhornia crassipes of the family Pontederiaceae. The plant is very troublesome in warm regions since it floats on water and often clogs waterways, and is very difficult to control safely. Several of the compounds provided herein have been evaluated for their ability to control the growth of water hyacinth. In one such study, the test compounds were formulated in acetone and Tween 80 as described above and sprayed onto the leaves of water hyacinth plants which were growing in buckets placed in a greenhouse. The herbicidal activity was then determined by visual inspection seven days following application. Observations were made of treated plants and non treated control plants. The activity of the compounds was also compared to that of the commercial herbicide diuron, a dichlorophenylurea derivative. The results of the test are presented in Table 20.

A further embodiment of this invention is therefore a method of eliminating and controlling the growth of aquatic plants.This method is practiced by adding the active isoxazolylimidazolidinone derivatives to the water containing the submerged or floating aquatic plants, or otherwise contacting the plants with the active compounds, for example, by applying the compounds to the sub aqueous soil in which the aquatic plants are rooted. The compounds may be applied to the water as dusts when admixed with a powdered solid carrier such as bentonite, Fuller s earth, diatomaceous earth, or various mineral silicates, e.g., mica, talc, pyrophyllite, and clays.The compounds may also be mixed with surface active dispersing agents to form concentrates to facilitate dispersion in water and to improve the wetting properties when used as sprays. If desired, the compounds may be mixed with a powdered solid carrier, together with a surface active dispersing agent, so that a wettable powder may be obtained which may be applied directly, cr which may be shaken with water to make an aqueous dispersion for application in that form. These wettable powder formulations suitably contain from about 25 to about 85 percent by weight of the active ingredient, i.e., an aquatic growth regulating compound coming within the scope of the generic formulae, supra.The compounds may be dissolved in an oil, such as a hydrocarbon or chlorinated hydrocarbon oil, and the oil solution of the compound dispersed in water with the aid of a surface active dispersing agent to give a sprayable aqueous dispersion. Such surface active dispersing agents may be anionic, nonionic, or cationic surface active agents. Such surface active agents are well known, and reference is made to Hoffitian et al.,U.S. Patent No. 2,614,916, columns 2 4, for detailed examples of the same. The compounds useful in this embodiment of the invention may also be applied by the aerosol method.Solutions for the aerosol treatment may be prepared by dissolving the compound directly in the aerosol carrier, which is a liquid under pressure, but which is a gas at ordinary temperature e.g. 200C. and atmospheric pressure or, the aerosol solution may be prepared by first dissolving the compound in a less volatile solvent, and then admixing such solution with the highly volatile liquid aerosol carrier. Further, the compounds useful as aquatic growth regulators can also be applied in an invert emulsion formulation. An invert emulsion formulation is prepared by first making a solution of an aquatic growth regulating compound in heavy oils, such as diesel fuel, inverting oil, and the like, and combining the thus obtained solution with water under high shear stirring. The thick emulsion is placed in the water and sinks to the bottom of the lake, river, pond, or the like, and the aquatic growth regulator is gradually released to control the growth of the aquatic plants.The following is an example of an invert emulsion formulation, prepared using the compound of Example No. 1 of this application. Invert Emulsion Compound of Example No. 1 12.5 gm Diesel fuel 333 ml Inverting oil 333 ml Vioko Rhap Inverting Oil Rhodia, Inc. Two hundred fifty milliliters of this solution is combined with 3750 ml. of water under high shear stirring to give a thick invert emulsion. The compounds useful as aquatic growth regulators can also be applied as pellets which are prepared from a mixture of about 5 of the active ingredient, about 85 clay, and about 108 water, all percentages being by weight. The mixture is then extruded through a pellet mill using a suitably sized die, e.g., about 1 8 in. diameter. The extruded pellets are about 1 8 in. by 1 1 2 in., and are then dried to about 8 moisture content. The method of controlling aquatic plant growth provided by this invention is practiced by adding to the water containing the submerged or floating plants a growth regulating or herbicidal amount of one of the herein disclosed compounds, such that a concentration of from about 0.01 to about 10 ppm. of the active compound is attained. A preferred method of aquatic plant growth regulation provided by this invention is directed toward the control of plants such as water hyacinth. Such plants can be controlled by foliar or root application of a compound of this invention at a rate of about 0.01 to about 1.0 pounds per acre about 0.011 to about 1.1 kg ha . The optimum concentration of active compound for any specific aquatic weed control problem varies with the temperature, the species to be controlled, and the shape of the body of water to be treated. At higher water temperatures, less compound is generally required for a given degree of control than is needed at lower temperatures. When used to control algae or aquatic plant growth, the compounds will usually be employed at concentrations of about 0.1 to about 10 ppm. In terms of pounds of compound per acre of water one foot deep, 0.1 to 10 ppm. is equal to about 0.3 to about 30 pounds per acre of water one foot deep. A preferred aquatic plant growth regulation method according to this invention comprises employing the compound of Example Nos. 1, 2, 4, 9, and 10. Such compounds may be applied to the aqueous growth environments as dispersible powders or in solution with watermiscible solvents.
