# Process for producing materials with optical transparency in the infrared.

## Abstract
A process for producing materials with optical transpa rency in the infrared, apt to be used as raw materials for fabricating optical devices or conductors. A chemical vapor deposition process is used to obtain high purity chalcogenides from a double substitution reaction.
