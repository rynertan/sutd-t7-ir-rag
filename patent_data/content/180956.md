# HIGH SPEED LOGIC INTERFACE CIRCUIT

## Abstract
A very high speed, low power integrated interface circuit 10 using GaAs or InP technology is provided for converting small digital voltage swings 14 to larger swings 22 which are particularly suitable for analog control signals. The preferred embodiments employ solely depletion mode MES FETS and Schottky diodes in Schottky diode field effect logic SDFL configurations.
