# Stabilizing polysaccharide solutions for tertiary oil recovery at elevated temperature with borohydride.

## Abstract
A method of tertiary oil recovery from petroleum containing formations at elevated temperature comprises injecting a substantially oxygen free aqueous saline solution of water soluble polysaccharide biopolymer treated at pH of at least 5 by the addition of alkali metal borohydride as viscosity stabilizer.
