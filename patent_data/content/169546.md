# Magnetic tape cassette.

## Abstract
Within a cassette 1 an aperture is formed on one of its walls through which a recording and or reproducing opera tion is accessable, the housing has a positioning opening 5 in the bottom wall 1B for receiving a positioning pin 8 therein in an operative position. An indication means for indicating specific condition of the cassette 1 comprises a connecting hole 50 54 formed in said housing in alignment with said positioning opening 5 and a plug element 6 which is slidably inserted in said connecting hole 50 54 . Said plug element 6 may be locked at upward and downward positions, comprise a large radius portion 61 at one end engageable with the connecting hole 50 54 and a small radius portion 63 at another end and further a locking finger 64 projecting at least toward one direction, engaging said connecting hole 50 54 at shoulder portions 55, 56 for locking said plug element 6 , which may have a slit through which the small radius portion 63 and the finger portion 64 pass the back side of said shoulder portions 55, 56 . The finger portion 64 may be engageable with the shoulder portion 55,56 by rotating said plug element 6 by a predetermined angle. A spring 7 inside of said connecting hole 50 54 may urge said plug element 6 upwardly. Thus at least two differently sized types of cassettes may be freely interchanged, a cassette information access being possible in any case in a safe manner.
