## Description
Description Form of Industrial InventionDescription of the Industrial Invention with the title Exhuast gases and fumes Humidifier by SalvatoreTreccosti, Italian, presently residing at Via runo Buozzi, 36, Reggio Calabria, Italy. DescriPtionThe Exhaust gases and fumes Humidifier completely eliminates air pollution caused by exhaust gases or fumes from the smallest internal combustion engine to the largest industrial conveyer. It can be applied to exhaust pipes before or after the silencer if the muffler isn t corridible . For the large conveyers one or more Hhmidifiers opportunately colligated to the walling are applied to the outer wall thus eliminating the stack and humidifing the gases or fumes to the ground or making the possible residues discharge into a tank to enable them to be treated if needed be. Humidification of the gases occurs by means of a small quantity of water held in a container which enalbles it to reach the Humidifier through a small downward and resuction pipe.The gas, on contact with the water, becomes impregnated by a deviced system and deposits itself, discharges to the ground in liquid state, without expanding in the air. The system is the same for large conve yers except that if the large gas or fume mass has not an adequate thrust inorder to pass into the device or into the group of devices, a forced trust or a forced aspiration will be provided by a colligated aspirator with opportune flanges at the heads of the devices.The advantages of the system of hmmidification under examination are many a The exhaust gases and fumes of different types on con tact with the water lose their toxicity through a che mical reaction with the substances that compose water EMI1.1 b The exhaust gases and fumes impregnating in the devices of humidification tend to deposit onto the ground, rather than extending into the air with all the inconveniences that can derive c The Humidifier applied to the exhaust pipes of the internal combustion engine, remarkably cuts down combustion noises as well, with great advantages foe people or for the envi ronment in which we live in.Costruction of the ILiidifier does not need any particular and expensive materials, nor sophisticated fixtures or highly specialized workers. The materials needed come down to simple pipes and steel perforated sheet iron or stainless steel which lasts longer Other materials can also be used.The water container can be built in galvanized thin plate and in several sizes. It is equipped with an ordinary water tap on fixed means or devices with an electromagnetic valve for mobile buses, lorries and light machinery or else with a self contained automatic system, by means of an air press situated at the discharge of clean gases that carries the air to the water container through a pipe, and thieh with a light pressure exerted in the tank, brings the water out through a small upward pipe to automatically feed the Humi difier. Consumption of the water varies according to the quantity of fumes or gases to be humidified.Devices in operation. Xestdone. Example 1000 e.c. about one litre per hour, to reach about 4litres on large 8 cylinder lorry engines. Presently there are no existing devices capable of producing even in small measures the advantage. of the said system of humidification. Infact, all the gases and fumes exhausts from internal combustion engines and from industrial conveyers let the same gases and fumes expand into the air freely provoking serious environmental pollution promblems. Furthermore such equippment contain no device that modifies in the least the toxicity of exhuast gases.EMI2.1 1The Exhaust gases and fumes Humidifer is composed of 1 an outer cylinder shaped covering it can be curved shaped at the extremity of the discharge it also holds caps for cleaning.2 one or more perforated sheet iron cones two, three four etc. , shaped so that the surface of the holes is proportioned to the quantity of gas to be freely ejected, and with at least a 15fo allowance of each cone lelement applied.3 a small stainless steel nozzle pipe which verses the water onto the rear cone and which comes with an outer orifice already set foe the quantity of the water to be dosed. It can come withmore nozzles on large devices. The cone shapeof the perforated surface forces the gases which already have a pressure, and those without one having come from the engine or conveyer to spray the water coming from the nozzle pipe and therefore to disintergrate, become impregnated with the water itself and to become moist. The gases, being impregnated on the first cone, discharge through the holes on the second or third cone or the following cones which complete the humidification and discharge operations. The exhaust gases, passing through the cones, become impregnated with the water and go through a trnsformation which render them non toxic. The described humidifier must be put in a horizontal position at about 180 degrees.
