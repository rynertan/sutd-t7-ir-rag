# Electrical interconnect arrangement for a GFCI magnetic sensor module plug in subassembly.

## Abstract
A ground fault circuit interrupter interconnect arrange ment provides wireless connection with line and neutral main current terminals by insertion through an aperture in the interrupter magnetic sensor module to form a magnetic sensor plug in subassembly. The electronics components and trip solenoid are mounted to the interrupter printed wire board. The magnetic sensor subassembly is plugged into the printed wire board for interconnection with the electronics components. This allows the interrupter to be assembled in a completely automated process.
