# High accuracy navigating apparatus with step driven projected chart.

## Abstract
A small fraction of the area shown in an ultraminiature color transparency of a standard navigating chart is projec ted onto a viewing screen, and the transparency is moved by a precision stepdriven transport mechanism to hold the present position of the ship or other craft at crosshairs on the screen. The transport mechanism is controlled by a digital electronic computer that receives data from a human operator, from speed and direction sensors carried in the craft, and or from radio navigational aid such as Loran signals. The computer includes separate dedicated micro processors for managing the transport mechanism and the receipt of sensor or radio signals, and a master generalpur pose processor for performing calculations and coordi nating the system functions with operator instructions. The computer calculates position, course to steer, and other parameters based on dead reckoning, manually entered bearings of navigational objects, and or the data automatically received from such radio aids and it controls the transparency transport on the basis of calculated posi tion. By comparing dead reckoning results with actual posi tion fixes the computer determines set and drift, and it reads out course to steer that is corrected for set and drift. The computer can also control an autopilot, automatically set ting a heading that produces the desired track, practically independent of currents.
