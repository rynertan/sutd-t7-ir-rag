## Description
PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF AN N SUBSTITUTED CARBAMOYL LACTAM COMPOUND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to a process for the preparation of an N substituted carbamoyllactam compound. In the anionic polymerization of lactams, such as caprolactam, N substituted carbamoyllactam compounds are suitable promoters, or activators, for the polymerization. These compounds can be used in the reaction injectionmolding RIM of nylon. Such compounds can provide short reaction times, which makes it possible to polymerize the lactam in the mold, without unduly long polymerization times. Reaction injection molding RIM method basically is a one shot injection of liquid components, usually by impingement, into a closed mold where rapid polymerization occurs thereby resulting in a molded plastic product. In a RIM process, viscosity of the materials fed to a mold is about 50 to 10,000 cps, preferably about 1500 cps, at injection temperatures varying from room temperature for urethanes to about 1500C for lactams. Mold temperatures in a RIM process typically range from about 1000 to about 220 CC. The mold pressures generally range from about 1 to 100 bar and more particularly, range from about 1 to about 30 bar. At least one component in th RIM formulation consists of monomers and adducts thereof that are polymerized to a polymer in the mold. RIM differs from injection molding in a number of important respects. The main distinction between injection molding and RIM resides in the fact that in RIM, a chemical reaction takes place in the mold to transform a monomer or adducts to a polymeric state. Injection molding is conducted at pressures of about 700 to 1400 bar in the mold cavity by melting a solid resin and conveying it into a mold maintained at room temperature and the molten resin at about 1500 to 3500C. The pressures employed in the RIM method are much lower than in conventional injection molding processes. At injection temperature of about 1500 to 3500C, viscosity of the molten resin in an injection molding process is generally in the range of 50,000 to 1,000,000 and typically about 200,000 cps. In injection molding process, solidification of the resins occurs in about 10 to 90 seconds, depending on the size of the molded product, following which, the molded product is removed from the mold. There is no chemical reaction taking place in an injection molding process when the resin is introduced into a mold. For practical purposes, in a RIM process the chemical reaction must take place rapidly in less than about 2 minutes for smaller items. The following developments in the anionic polymerization nylon are known. The polymerization of a lactam to obtain nylon has been known for many years.

This process is broadly characterized in that a polyol and a lactam blocked polyisocyanate are reacted in the liquid state in the presence of a metal compound catalyst. The present invention to provide a reliable, simple an reproducable process for preparing N substituted carbamoyl lactam compounds, which compounds can be used to prepare impact resistant nylon block copolymers. The process according to the present invention is very useful for preparing compounds which may be used in the preparation of nylon block copolymers, such as in RIM nylon systems Reaction Injection Molding . When the compounds obtained according to the present invention are employed in a RIM nylon system, the lactam polymerization rate is very rapid. In addition, this process is important to processors for preparing of polyurethane resins, for example in coatings. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The process according to the invention is characterized in that a polyol and a lactam blocked polyisocyanate are reacted in the liquid state in the presence of a suitable catalyst. The reaction temperature can most advantageously be between the melting point of the lactam and 1500C. The reaction is preferably carried out in molten lactam. More particularly, the reaction is conducted in molten caprolactam. Surprisingly and quite unexpectedly, the reaction between a polyol and a lactam blocked diisocyanate in the presence of a metal catalyst, at a low temperature, proceeds quickly. Moreover, virtually no polymerization of the lactam itself occurs, if at all. Also, and quite unexpectedly, this process is especially well suited for 1,6 hexane diisocyanate. Indeed, it has surprisingly been found that the reaction with a polyol can be selectively carried out with a symmetrical, lactam blocked diisocyanate and an alkali earth metal. By the term lactam blocked poly or diisocyanate is meant the reaction product of a polyisocyanate or a diisocyanate with a lactam. A particularly suitable lactam is caprolactam. In principle, the isocyanate groups have reacted with a lactam molecule to form the following compound 5 EMI8.1 In the process according to the invention, the compounds having the following formula can be formed EMI8.2 tb SEP o SEP H SEP H SEP O tb SEP II SEP I SEP I SEP ii tb R SEP SEP SEP SEP 0 SEP SEP L SEP SEP C SEP SEP N SEP SEP R SEP SEP N SEP SEP C SEP L 3x tb SEP yi SEP 1 tb wherein tb R is a polyol originating from a polyol having the formula R OH Xi, where Xi is an integer 2 R is an alkyl, aralkyl, alkaryl or aryl group, whether or not cyclic, Yi is an integer 0, L is an unopened lactam ring and L is an opened lactam block. Exemplary R groups include, for instance, hexamethylene, toluyl, difenymethylene and 1,5 hexyl. R groups include, for instance, polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol and copolymers thereof, ethoxylated and or propoxylated triols and tetrols. The L and L groups can be derivatives of an identical lactam ring. Advantageously, the lactam ring has from 5 to 12 carbon atoms. Depending on the reaction conditions, a different Yi value may apply for each carbamoyl lactam group bound to the polyol. The Yi value depends on whether the lactam group is eliminated or is opened during the reaction. If the lactam group is eliminated, Ii equals zero. If the lactam group is opened, it will be 1. However, in certain cases it may be advantageous that a relatively small polyamide block is formed between the polyol and the poly isocyanate. The presence of an opened lactam group in the N substituted carbamoyl lactam compound can have an advantageous effect upon the mechanical properties of the nylon block copolymer prepared therewith. Such lactam groups have a tendency to influence the behavior of the activator molecule in the partially polymerized polyol lactam system. It is presently believed that during polymerization the activator precipitates from the lactam polyamide system. The presence of some lactam groups apparently either prevent premature phase separation, or, alternatively force the activator groups to the phase boundary. In both situations, this means that the activator groups can advantageously perform the desired objects for a greater length of time during the polymerization reaction. The amount of eliminated lactam groups, as a fraction of the theoretically possible amount, ranges from about 0.01 to about 0.95.More particularly the amount of eliminated lactam groups is between about 0.50 and about 0.75.Intermediate lower values, however, such as 0.05, 0.10 and 0.25 are also suitable. The mean value of Yi is, therefore, 1 minus the amount of eliminated lactam. The amount of opened lactam blocks is determinated by the in oz catalyst ss can be seen in the examples. Various catalysts can be used for the process of the invention. The amount of the catalyst may vary and generally ranges from 0,5 mole 8 to 15 mole of the lactam blocked isocyanate compound. Suitable catalyst are various metal compounds, such metal compounds contain a metal or metals selected from the groups IA, IB, IIA, IIB,IIIA, IIIB, IVA, IVB, VB, VIB, VIIB and VIII. More particularly it is advantageous to use a group IA, IIA of VIll metal compounds. In a special embodiment of the present invention it is advantageous to use Lewis Acids. In most cases Lewis acids have no catalytic activity for the lactam polymerization but only for the reaction between polyol and the lactam blocked isocyanate. Examples of suitable catalysts are bromomagnesium lactamate, sodium lactamate, potassium lactamate, magnesium chloride, calcium ethoxide, calcium lactamate, calcium acetylacetonate, barium lactamate, barium chloride, barium acetylacetonate, zinc chloride, zinc acetylacetonate, zinc lactamate, cadmium chloride, cadmium acetyl acetonate, cadmium lactamate, boron acetylacetonate, aluminium trilactamate, aluminium chloride, chloroaluminium dilactamate, lactam aluminium chloride, tin II chloride, tin II ethoxide, tin II actylacetonate, titanium trichloride, titanium III acetylacetonate, titanium III ethoxide, vanadium III ethoxide, vanadium III acetylacetonate, vanadium III chloride, chromium III chloride, chromium III acetylacetonate, manganese II chloride, manganese II acetylacetonate, iron III chloride, iron III acetylacetonate, iron II acetylacetonate, cobalt II chloride, cobalt 11 acetylacetonate, nickel acetylacetonate, nickel chloride, chromium III acetate, copper II acetylacetonate. As a polyol various organic hydroxy compounds can be used such as, for instance, polyfunctional hydroxy compounds having at least two hydroxyl groups per molecule. Generally, the known polyols may be employed. Advantageously, the polyol is a polyetherpolyol, polyesterpolyol, polybutadienepolyol, siloxane containing polyol and or a so called polymeric polyol. The polymeric polyols as defined herein include graft polymers obtained by grafting one or more ethylenically unsaturated monomers onto a polyether polyol as well as the polyurea dispersions in polyols PUD . These polyurea dispersions can be obtained by dissolving a diamine or hydrazine together with a diisocyanate in stoichiometric amounts in a polyol and reaction the dissolved compounds to form a polyurea compound dispersed in the polyol.The amount of polyurea dispersed in the polyol is from 10 35 by weight of the total dispersion. The amount of the ethylenically unsaturated monomer grafted on the polyol ranges from about 10 to about 35 by weight on the final grafted product polymeric polyol . Examples of especially suitable grafting monomers are acrylonitrile or a mixture of styrene and acrylonitrile. A suitable commercial product of this type is known as Niax 31 28 produced by Union Carbide Corporation. Advantageously these polymeric polyols may be employed to yield a product nylon block, copolymer having a higher flexural modulus while, surprisingly, avoiding a decrease in impact resistance. Other examples of polyols that can advantageously be used are the poly oxyethylene and poly oxypropylene adducts or blends thereof of diols, triols and tetrols, polyols with polyether segments containing polyesters, polyester polyamine polyols and polylactones.Polyols obtained by ethoxylating and or propoxylating ethylene diamine, glucose, fructose, saccharose or trimethylolpropane are also suitable. The polyols described hereinabove are mainly of a relatively high molecular weight.Advantageously, the equivalent weight of these polyols is nc least 300 more particularly the equivalent weight ranges between about 1000 and about 2500. In these ranges optimal properties of the final object are obtained, viz. a high impactstrength combined with a high flexural modulus without problems in preparing the activator, due to high viscosity. It is to be understood that any molecular weight, or equivalent weight, referred to herein are numerical average weights. Furthermore, the term equivalent weight of a polyol is understood to mean the numerical average weight of the polyol per hydroxyl group, i.e. the molecular weight divided by the functionality. The lactam terminated diisocyanate can be prepared by reacting lactam such as caprolactam, and a diisocyanate, such as hexamethylenediisocyanate, isophorondiisocyanate, toluenediisocyanate, methylene bis phenyl isocyanate MDI and hydrogenated MDI, or modified MDI such as carbodiimide modified MDI, Isonate 143L, Upjohn Company or Mondur PF, Mobay Chemical Corporation and diol extended prepolymers of MDI Isonate 181 or 191 .Other possible isocyanates include, for example,XDI, H6XDI, and hydrogenated TDI. As aiready indicated, preferably the reaction medium is a molten lactam. More particularly, a suitable lactam is caprolactam.It is also possible, however, to carry out the reaction in another solvent which is inert to the polyisocyanate, such as a lactone. Such suitable alternative solvents include toluene, xylene, caprolactone and douecanolactzn . In addition, a mixture of lactam with an inert solvent or a mixture of different lactams may be used. Such lactams include, for instance, caprolactam and dodecanolactam. The ratio of the reaction products depends on their functionality and on the desired properties of the end product. In general, per equivalent of hydroxyl groups in the polyol to be used, at least one equivalent of lactam blocked diisocyanaste will be used, so that, in principle, every hydroxyl group can react with one lactamblocked diisocyanate molecule. In the case that a deficiency of diisocyanate is usedr relative to the number of hydroxyl groups, for example 3 diisocyanate molecules per 4 hydroxyl groups, it is achieved that a number of polyol molecules combine, so that a higher molecular polyol block is obtained. The invention will now be further explained by the following non limiting examples.Example I 295.9 g 0.75 mole caprolactam blocked hexamethylene diisocyanate, 79.1 g caprolactam and 750 g 0.375 mole polypropylene glycol a diol with a molecular weight of 2000, PPG 2000 were brought warmed heated to 1500C. Then, while stirring, 13.4 g sodium lactamate dissolved in caprolactam was added. The amount of catalyst relative to the blocked diisocyanate was 2.5 mole t. Immediately after addition of the catalyst, an increase in viscosity of the reaction mixture was observed. After reaction for 1 hour at 1500C the mixture was cooled to room temperature. Analysis showed that the amount of free caprolactam had increased, so that in at least part of the reaction caprolactam must have been eliminated.Polypropylene glycol and unreacted blocked diisocyanate were no longer detectable. The amount of eliminated caprolactam was 64 .Example II 5.9 g 0.015 mole caprolactam blocked hexamethylene diisocyanate, 1.6 g caprolactam and 20 g 0.01 mole PPG 2000 were heated at 1500C.At this temperature, while stirring, 1.1 g sodium lactamate in caproiactam 10 mole catalyst relative to blocked diisocyanate was added. A reaction was allowed to continue for 15 minutes at 1500C. The reaction mixture was then cooled to room temperature. Neither polypropylene glycol nor unreacted blocked diisocyanate could be detected in the product. The amount of free caprolactam, however, had clearly increased, so that in at least part of the reaction caprolactam must have been eliminated.Example III Comparative Example 5.9 g 0.015 mole caprolactam blocked hexamethylene diisocyanate, 1.6 g caprolactam and 20 g 0.01 mole PPG 2000 were heated at 1900C for 15 minutes, with stirring to obtain a product.After cooling the product to room temperature, no change of the initial composition was found to have occurred.Examples IV through IX Caprolactam blocked hexamethylene diisocyanate, caprolactam and a polyol mentioned in Table I were heated to a temperature also mentioned inTabel I.With stirring at this temperature the sodium lactamate catalyst was added.

At this temperature 1.9 g 1.9 mmole of lactammagnesium bromide was mixed in. After 2 hours at 1500C the mixture was cooled to room temperature. Upon analysis it was found that 60 of the lactam was eliminated, and that no free PPG 2000 and lactam blocked toluenediisocyanate could be detected. Example XI 50 grams of caprolactam blocked hexamethylene diisocyanate, containing 39.5 grams 0.1 mol of blocked diisocyanate and 10.5 grams of caprolactam, and 100 grams 0.05 mol of polypropylene glycol a diol with a molecular weight of 2000, PPG 2000 were brought to 1500C. Then 0.93 grams of aluminum chloride were added, with stirring. Immediately after addition of the catalyst an increase in viscosity of the reaction mixture was observed. At half hour intervals a sample was taken from the reaction mixture and was analyzed for the presence of unreacted caprolactam blocked hexamethylene diisocyanate and unreacted polypropylene glycol. Both substances were no longer detectable after reaction for two hours. All caprolactam was eliminated.Example XII 50 grams 0.1 mol of caprolactam blocked hexamethylene diisocyanate, with the same composition as in Example I, and 100 grams 0.05 mol of PPG 2000 were brought to 1250C.
