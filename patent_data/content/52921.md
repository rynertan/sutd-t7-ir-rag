# Methods and compositions for assaying for the production of 1,4 dihydropyridyl.

## Abstract
Methods and compositions for assaying for coenzymes having N substituted 1,4 dihydropyridyl as the active portion of the prosthetic group. The conversion of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide NAD to its reduced form NADH is widely measured both for determining NAD NADH includ ing the analogs thereof dependent enzymes and enzymes that can be coupled to NAD NADH dependent enzymes, and for determining ligands or receptors in competitive protein binding assays. Antibodies specific for NADH in the presence of NAD are employed, providing enhanced fluorescence over the normal fluorescence of unbound NADH. By determining the rate of formation of NADH or the concentration of NADH, the analyte or enzyme of interest can be determined.
