## Description
DOCUMENT SECURITY SYSTEM, METH D ANDAPPAr o7 Background of the Invention Commercial transactions are commonly completed with reference to a document the authenticity and unaltered status of which are vital factors. Securities transactions which involve stock certificates and bank transactions which involve checks, passbooks, credit cards, and the like, all depend in various ways upon the authentic and unaltered status of such documents to service the account of a customer, client or user quickly and without error. In such transactions where a document representing some value is involved, there is great incentive for unscrupulous operators to duplicate, counterfeit or in some way alter the document in order to derive undeserved value from the transaction. Many schemes have been established for detecting the authenticity of documents and the authority of an individual involved in completing a transaction. Such schemes include physical, optical, magnetic or electrical detectors in various combinations to check for certain indicia of authenticity of the document and to obtain certain information therefrom for use in completing an associated transaction. Schemes of this type are disclosed in the literature see, for example, U. S. Patents 4,140,272, 4,138,058 and 4,138,057 . It would be desirable to update the data associated with a document to account for changes due to age, frequency of use, altered physical characteristics and the like, during normal use to assure that the document may continue to be used6 normal changes in its physical properties which may adversely affect rigid security detection schemes. Summary of the Invention In accordance with the present invention, a document such as a bearer certificate or credit card, or the like, is formed in a manner that includes detectable physical characteristics which are unique for the specific document. In addition, the present invention includes an encoding system which translates user information and the detected physical characteristics of the document into encrypted data that is recorded on the document for subsequent comparisons and updates as the document is used. In this manner, the normal aging or deterioration of the document through continued use can be accounted for without losing the encrypted data or the security aspects associated therewith. Description of the Drawings Figure 1 is a pictorial diagram of a document detecting apparatus according to the present invention and Figure 2 is a graph showing amplitudes of readings along portions of the document being detected according to the apparatus of Figure 1 Figure 3 is a schematic diagram of one embodiment of the logic unit of Figure 1 and Figure 4 is a flow chart which illustrates the operation of the apparatus of Figures 1 and 3. Description of the Preferred Embodiment Referring now to Figure 1, there is shown one embodiment of the present invention in which a document 9 is interposed between an array of detectors 11 and an array of sources 13 that cooperate with the detectors 11 to produce qualitative responses indicative of the document 9 being interposed between the corresponding sets of sources and detectors 11, 13.Specifically, the sources 13 may produce beams of optical radiation 15 that are detected by the associated optical detectors 11, each of which responds in a manner that is representative of the optical properties of the document 9 at the specific location thereon where the corresponding beam traverses the document 9. Thus, as shown on the graph of Figure 2, the responses by the detectors 11 will in general be different at different locations along the test region 17 on document 9. An optical part or aperture 19 may be provided in the document 9 to align with source 21 and detector 23 for establishing a reference position for repeatably orienting the document 9 at the same test location relative to the arrays of sources 13 and detectors 11.An edge of the document 9 may also be detected. However, the positioning accuracy provided thereby is likely to deteriorate as the edge erodes or is otherwise destroyed from continued use. Of course, it should be understood that other forms of radiative energy may also be used to detect other physical properties of a document 9. For examp e, high frequency electrostatic field sources may be detected capacitively with responses that are indicative of the properties of the interposed document 9 at the specific test locations therealong in the test region 17. Thus, for optical sources and detectors 11, 13 the optical transmissivity of the document 9 at each location will affect the analog or level readings at each location. Similarly, for R.F.electrostatic field sources and detectors 11, 13, the electrical conductivity of conductive inks on the document 9 at each location will also affect the readings at each location. In one preferred embodiment, it has been determined that paper provides distinctive readings on narrow optical beams disposed at spaced locations for reasons that are believed to be associated with inhomogeneous orientations of fibrous materials and fillers of which the paper is formed. Thus, where the document is a credit card, it is desirable to laminate and encapsulate a layer of paper 25 between outer laminates 27 of sheet like plastic in order to form an inexpensive and highly distinctive encoding medium that will not change significantly with time, temperature, humidity, and the like. Such a document or credit card 9 may therefore be detected or read to determine its unique Zsignaturew of detected values, as shown in Figure 2, at the spaced locations.These readings are converted to digital equivalent values by conventional means not shown such as analog to digital converters associated with each detector 11.Thus, a particular document 9 may be identified by a unique set of digital values such as 155, 130, 152, 120, 145, 128, , 132 from the array of detectors 11 and associated digitizers.However, these values are likely to change in small amounts as the document 9 becomes dirty or wrinkle or abraded, or the like, from repeated usage. In the preferred embodiment, the logic unit 29 tolerates a margin of deviation in the detected values and then records the updated values in an encrypted manner, if other security checks are satisfied. The newly recorded reading values are thereafter used as the updated standards for comparison in the next transaction. In operation, the document or credit card 9 is moved along a path relative to transducer 31 by conventional means to enable the sources and detectors 11, 13 to extract recorded data from the record area 33 when the document 9 is positioned precisely at the reference location as determined by aperture 19 and the source 21 and detector 23. The digitized readings from detectors 11 when the document 9 is located at the reference location are used as encryption inputs, along with other data from the document 9 and other data supplied by the user via keyboard 35. The transducer 31 preferably a magnetic transducer operating on magnetic recording stripe 33 extracts encrypted data signals from the document 9 that include, for example, the account number of the authorized user, the values of readings previously taken, and such other data as account balance, credit limits, and the like. In the illustrated embodiments of Figures 3 and 4, the authorized. user enters his Personal Identification Number PIN 36 via the keyboard 35 for encryptin 37 in module 20 with other data. The Data Encryption Standard DES module 20 of conventional type available as an intefrated circht t vg manufactured by the Motorola Corp. may be operated either to encrypt or decrypt signals applied to inputs thereof.Thus, the signals derived from the document 9 by magnetic transducer 31 mal be formatted to include the account number 38 of the user in clear text, plus data 39 about the user s account and previous readings taken from the document 9 at the spaced locations, all encrypted 37 in accordance with a logical combination or encryption standard in module 20 that is determined by the user Personal Verification Number PVN .This PVN may be formed firs by encrypting in module 20 the account number with the PIN 36 from keyboard 35, and the resulting PVN may be stored only in th module 20 to serve as the secured key code for decrypting the signals from transducer 37. If the resulting PVN 40 is correct for the current user, then the signals from transducer 31 are decrypted 41 to yield the previously recorded digitized readings 24 of the document 9 at the specific locations, along with such other data 42 as the user s account information, and the like.The data signals extracted from the document 9 were previously encrypted using PVN as an encryption key, as later described in connection with completion of the current transaction.Similarly, the document 9 may be initialized upon first use by a authorized user by entering account number 38, the user s PIN 36 and associated account data for encryption 47 and recordation 49 on the document. The decrypted data signals 42 thus include, among other things, data concerning the users account and the reading value regarding the document 9 as previously interrogated in the prior transaction. These previous readings 24 as recorded and decrypted are compared 43 with a current set of digitized readings 45 of the document 9 under the conditions of the document 9 being in proper location. The signal 22 formed by the optical shutter comprising source 21, aperture 19 and detector 23 enables gate 26 when the document 9 is properly located to produce the current set of digitized readings 45. The current set of readings 45 and the decrypted set of readings 24 are applied to the inputs of a conventional comparator 30 which compares 43 corresponding ones of the sets of readings for parity within tolerance or error limits.In one embodiment, a digital counter is incremented on the first decrypted reading and decremented on the first current reading to yield zero count plus or minus a preset limit or tolerance count , and sequentially or serially, is incremented on the second decrypted reading.and decremented on the second current reading, and so on.The tolerance limit about zero count may be controlled by preset counts, or other conventional means applied to input 32. If the decrypted readings 24 and the current readings 28 compare favorably within the preset tolerance limits, the output 34 from comparator 30 enables the gate 44 to supply data 46 for completing a transaction. The data as modified 48 by such transaction is then applied to inputs of the data encryption module 20 for encryption 47 with the current set of readings 45 under the control of the PVN signal previously prepared and stored in the module 20. The newly encrypted data 49 containing the updated, current readings, and other data are then recorded 50 on the document 9 by such conventional means as a magnetic transducer 31 operating on magnetic recording stripe 33, or a bar code reader printer for optical reading and writing, or the like. In this way, the reading values from the document 9 are updated to compensate for deterioration of the physical properties of the document 9 that establish its unique signature . Tight limits of comparison 43 may therefore be maintained in order to assure a high level of discrimination between distinctive documents 9.
