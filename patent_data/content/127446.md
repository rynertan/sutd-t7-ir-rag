The compounds of this invention are active herbicides of a general type. That is, they are berbicidally effective against a wide range of plant specides. The method of controlling undesirable vegetation of the present invention ccmprises applying an herbicidaily effective amount of the above described compounds to the area where control is desired. The compounds of the present invention can be prepared by the following general method.EMI2.1 wherein R is as defined. and TEC is a transesterification caLalyst such asTi O alkyl 4, preferably Ti isobutoxy 4. The compounds of this invention can have the following two structural forouiae because of tautomerism, that is, the proton on the imidazole nitrogen can reside on either nitrogen and is reasonably labile. Strucual formula I is the tautomer Which is believed to predominate in the solid state since the infrared spectra show longer wave length car bonyl bands compared to ordinary esters. This fact suggests hydrogen bonding is possible only in the tautomer I. EMI3.1 Both tautomers I and II are believed to be in mobile equilibriun in solutions or in the liquid state. The e proton on tautomers I and II is acidic and can be removed by any base to give a salt having an anion of the following two resonsance forms EMI3.2 Examples of cat ions of these bases can be an inorganic cation such as Na , Kt, Ca , Na4 or it can be an organic cation such as hydro carbyl sstituted ammonium, sul foniun, or phosphonium. These salts are stable compounds and can be isolated. They are also herbicidally active. The imidazoles of the invention are also basic. The unprotonated nitrogen atan of tautaner Ia or IIa can be protonated by an acid, preferably an inorganic acid. Illustrative inorganic acids are hydrochloric and hydrobranic, sulfuric, phosphoric and acetic. These salts are also herbicidal. The salts can be conventionally prepared by reacting at least a mole amount of a lexis acid or a Lewis base with the ester. Preferably, the reaction is run in a solvent for the ester with heating, if necessary.The prepared salt is recovered fran the reaction mixture by conventional techniques. In general, the salts are not as herbicidally active as the parent compound. Generally, at least one mole of the alcohol is used for the reaction with the ethyl ester to prepare the imidazoles. Preferably, a slight mole excess of the alcohol is used. The reaction mixture is refluxed until completin of the reaction. The reaction product is recovered by removing the volatile materials. Atmospheric, subatmospheric Cr superstmospheric pressures can be used, depending on the boiling point of the solvent used. Ethanol is conventiently stripped at elevated temper atures and reduced pressure. The reaction product is worked up by conventional techniques.

The compound of the present invention are useful as herbicides, and can be applied in a variety of ways at various concentrations. In practice, the compounds herein defined are formulated into herbicidal compositions, by admixture, in herbicidally effective amounts, with the adjuvants and carriers nrrmally employed for facilitating the dispersion of active ingredients for agricultural applications, reconizing the fact that the formulation and mode of application of a toxicant may affect the activity of the materials in a given application. Thus, these active herbicidal nçds may be formulated as granules of relatively large particle size, as wettable powders, as emulsifiable concentrates, as powdery dusts, as solutions or as any of several other known types of formulations, depending upon the desired mode of application. Preferred formulationS for pre emergence herbicidal applications are wettable powders, alsifiable concentrates and granules.These formulations may contain as little as about 0.5 to as much as about 95 or mare by weight of active ingredient. A herbicidally effective amount depends upon the nature of the seeds or plants to be controlled and the rate of application varies fran about 0.05 to approximately 25 pourds per acre, preferably fran about 0.1 to about 10 pounds per acre. Table powders are in the form of finely divided particles which disperse readily in water or other dispersants. The wettable powder is ultimately applied to the soil either as a dry dust ar as a dispersion in water or other liquid. Typical carriers for wettable powders include fuller s earth, kaolin clays, silicas and other readily wet organic or inorganic diluents. Table pokers normally are prepared to contain about 5 to about 95 of the active ingredient and usually also contain a small amount of wetting, dispersing, or emulsifying agent to facilitate wetting and dispersion. Enisifiable concentrates are homogeneous liquid capositions which are dispersible in water or other dispersant, ard may consist entirely of the active xvpound with a liquid or solid emulsifying agent, or may also contain a liquid carrier, such as xylene, heavy aromatic naph tha, isophorone and other non volatile organic solvents. Bor herbicidal application, these concentrates are dispersed in water or other liquid carrier and normally applied as a spray to the area to be treated. The percentage by weight of the essential active ingredient may vary according to the manner in which the composition is to be applied, but in general comprises about 0.5 to 95 of active ingredient by weight of the herbicidal composition. Granular formulations therein the toxicant is carried on relatively coarse particles, are usually applied without dilution to the area in which suppression of vegetation is desired. Typical carriers for granular formulations include sand, fuller s earth, bentonite clays, vermiculite, perlite and other organic or inorganic materials which absorb or zilch may be coated with the toxicant. Granular formulations normally are prepared to contain about 5 to about 25 of active ingredients which may include surface active agents such as wetting agents, dispersing agents or emulsifiers oil such as heavy aranatic naphthas, kerosene or other petro letiti fractions, or vegetable oils and or stickers such as dextrins, glue or synthetic resins. Typical wetting, dispersing or emulsifying agents used in agricultural formulations include, for example, the alkyl and allylaryl sulfonates and sulfates and their sodium salts polyhydroxy alcohols and other types of surface active agents, many of which are available in aannerce. The surface active agent, when used, normally conprises fran 0.1 to 15 by weight of the herbicidal composition. Dusts, iich are free flowing admixtures of the active ingredient with finely divided solids such as talc, clays, flours and other organic and inorganic solids which act as dispersants and carriers for the tox icant, are useful formulations for soil incorporating application. Pastes, which are hanogeneous suspensions of a finely divided solid toxicant in a liquid carrier such as water or oil, are employed for specific purposes. These formulations normally contain about 5 to about 95 of active ingredient by weight, and may also contain small amounts of a wetting, dispersing or emulsifying agent to facilitate dispersion. For application, the pastes are normally diluted and applied as a spray to the area to be affected. Other useful formulations for herbicidal applications include single solutions of the active ingredient in a dispersant in which it is completely soluble at the desired concentration, such as acetone, alkyl ated naahthalenes, xylene and other organic solvents. Pressurized sprays, typically aerosols, wherein the active ingredient is dispersed in finelydivided form as a result of vaporization of a low boiling dispersant solvent carrier, such as the Peons, may also be used. The phytotoxic compositions of this invention are applied to the plants in the conventional manner. Thus, the dust and liquid compositions can be applied to the plant by the use of powder dusters, boan and hand sprayers and spray dusters. The compositions can also be applied from airplanes as a dust or a spray because they are effective in very low dosages.In order to modify or control growth of germinating seeds or emerging seedlings, as a typical exawle, the dust and liquid compositions are applied to the soil according to conventional methods and are distributed in the soil to a depth of at least 1 2 inch below the soil surface,It is not necessary that the phytotoxic compositions be admixed with the soil particles since these compositions can also be applied merely by spraying or sprinkling the surface of the soil.The phytotoxic composi tions of this iveention can also be applied by addition to irrigation water sullied to the field to be treated. This method of application permits the penetration of the compositions into the soil as the aster is absorbed therein. Dust ositions, granular compositions or liquid formulations applied to the surface of the soil can be distributed below the surface of the soil by conventional means such as discing, dragging or mixing operations. The phytotoxic compositions of this invention can also contain other additaments, for exaue, fertilizers and other herbicides, pesticides and the like, used as adjwant or in combination with any of the above described adjuvants. Other phytotoxic compounds useful in combination with the above described expounds include, for example, 2,4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acids, 2,4,5 trichlorophenoxyacetic acid, 2 methyl 4 chlorophenoxyacetic acid and the salts, esters and amides thereof, triazine derivatives, sudi as 2,4 bis 3 methoxypropylamino 6 methylthio s tria zine, 2 chloro 4 ethylamino 6 isopropylamino s triazine, and 2 ethylamino 4 isopropyl amino 6 methyl mercapto s triazine, urea derivatives, such as 3 3,5 dichlorophenyl l,l dimethylurea and 3 p chloro phenyl l,l dimethylurea and acetamides such as N,N diallyl alpha chloro acetamide, and the like benzoic acids such as 3 amino 2, 5 dichlorobenzoic acid thiocarbamates such as S propyl N,N dipropylthiocarbamate, S ethylN,N dipropylthiocarbamate, S ethyl cyclohexylethylthiocarbamate, S ethyl hexahydro 1Hazepine 1 carbothioate and the like anilines such as 4 methylsulfonyl 2,6 dihydro N,N substituted aniline, 4 trifluoromethyl2,6 dinitrio N,N di n propyl aniline, 4 trifluoromethyl 2,6 dinitro Nethyl N butyl aniline, 2 4 2,4 dichlorophenoxy phenoxy propanoic acid, 2 1 ethoxyimino butyl 5 2 ethylthio propyl 3 hydroxy 2 cyclohexene 1one, butyl 2 4 5 trifluoromethyl 2 pyridinyl oxy phenoxy propanate, sodium 5 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethyl phenoxy 2 nitrobenzoate, 3 isu propyl 1H 2,1,3 benzothiadiazine 4 3H one 2,2 dioxide, and 4 amino 6tert butyl 3 methylthio as triazin 5 4H one or 4 amino 6 1,1 dimethylethyl 3 methylthio 1,2,4 triazin 5 4H one . Fertilizers useful in combination with the active ingredients include, for example, ammonium nitrate, urea and superEhoephate. Other useful additaments include materials in which plant organists take root and grow such as compost, manure, humus, sand, and the like.
