# Polish compositions and polish vehicles useful therein.

## Abstract
Polymer compositions which are useful as polishes or polish polymer vehicles, especially floor polishes or vehicles therefor, contain emulsion copolymer containing from 3 to 50 by weight of units of acidic monomer, transition metal ionic crosslinking agent in an amount of at least 15 of the equivalent of the copolymer acid residues, and at least one basic salt or hydroxide or alkali metal in such an amount that the molar ratio of transition metal to alkali metal is from 10 0.1 to 1.0 3.0. The presence of the alkali metal compound increases the wear resistance properties of films of the polish.
