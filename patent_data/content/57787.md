# Process and mould for moulding or casting a tyre.

## Abstract
A tyre 10 produced by way of a moulding or casting process in a manner such that each of its bead areas 16 includes an annular slot 42 whereby the slots permit the insertion of an inextensible annular reinforcement element 40 into each of the bead area slots 42 after the moulding or casting process. Slots 42 are preferably produced by the addition of annular collars 64 to either the outer member 50 or core member 60 of an improved moulding or casting die 48 . The improved moulding or casting process includes a step of forming a circumferential slot 42 in each tyre bead area 16 , with these slots 42 permitting the addition of an inextensible annular reinforcement element 40 into each bead area 16 after the moulding or casting process.
