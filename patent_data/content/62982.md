# Isolated integrated circuit comprising a substrate electrode.

## Abstract
In a semiconductor device such as an IC chip, transistors 3 can be isolated by means of the passive isolation PI method. In use of the PI method, conventional methods of providing an electrode electrically connected to the semicon ductor substrate 1 may cause a decrease in the integration density of the IC chip. An embodiment of the present invention employs the vacant space outside the element forming regions 3 to accommodate such an electrode. To this end, polycrystalline silicon 32 can be placed in a groove 31 formed in the vacant space, and ohmic contact between this polycrystalline semiconductor material 32 and the semiconductor substrate 1 can be achieved while at the same time keeping the diffusion length of the impurities diffused from said polycrystalline silicon 32 , and from said semiconductor substrate 1 , very short. For example, up ward diffusion of impurities from an N type buried layer 9 can be substantially avoided in this way, to realize a high breakdown voltage in the semiconductor device.
