# Preparation of selected epoxides.

## Abstract
A process for the production of epoxides of the formula I CHEM in which the benzene ring A is substituted with 1 to 3 halogen atoms, which are the same or different, and optionally carries other substituents, and R 1 is CHEM which is the same as or different from the other group CHEM or C1 6 alkyl, the process comprising electrolysing the corresponding alkene of the formula II CHEM in a medium comprising a solvent for the alkene and an aqueous solution of a halogen salt, the solvent water ratio by weight being greater than unity, the solvent being miscible with water at the solvent water ratio used and being chemically inert to both the alkene and the free halogen produced from the halogen salt by the electrolysis. The epoxides are useful in the synthesis of fungicidal compounds and certain of the epoxides are novel compounds.
