# Apparatus for optically measuring a current.

## Abstract
A current is measured by making use of a rotation of po larization plane in a magnetic field, that is, a Faraday effect. A conductor 20 under measurement is transversely inserted in to a center opening of a Faraday effect glass 13 which has at least two total reflection areas on a periphery thereof so that a light directed into the Faraday effect glass is circulated around the conductor and emitted externally. The light emitted from the Faraday effect glass is split into at least two light beams, which are converted to electric signals by photo electric ele ments, and A.C. components contained in the electric signals are extracted and compared. The electric signals are correc ed based on the comparison result. The present measuring apparatus and method attain high precision current measurement in a stable manner over an ex tended period.
