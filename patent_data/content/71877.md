# Magnetic differential pressure valve with an indicator showing when valve has opened or closed.

## Abstract
A magnetic differential pressure valve is provided, having an indicator showing when the valve has moved into one of the open und closed positions, comprising a housing including a valve seat valve means reciprocably mounted in the housing for movement towards and away from the valve seat between open and closed positions first magnet ic means movable with the valve means toward and away from the valve seat first bias means urging the valve means and first magnetic means in one direction and normally re taining the valve means and first magnetic means in one of the closed and open positions first fluid duct means com municating with a source of fluid under pressure and with a pressure receiving surface on the valve means to urge it and the first magnetic means in the opposite direction second fluid duct means communicating with the first fluid duct means for fluid flow past the valve means only when the valve means has moved away from the valve seat into the open position second magnetic means movable toward and away from the first magnetic means and normally re tained in a first nonindicating position, reacting with the first magnetic means whenever the two means are within their mutually reactive magnetic fields of force, and the valve means is in one of the closed and open positions and second bias means urging the second magnetic means into one of the nonindicating and indicating positions when the first magnetic means has moved to a predetermined dis tance from the second magnetic means, the second magnet ic means in its indicating position indicating that the valve means has either opened or closed fluid flow communica tion between the first and second fluid duct means.
