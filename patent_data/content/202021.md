# Optical assay method and apparatus.

## Abstract
Optical assay apparatus Figure 2 of the type comprising an optic waveguide 1 1 1 and a coating 7 7 sensitized to a specific assay species. Light signal response is enhanced by coupling a resonant metallic medium 17 17 17 to the waveguide 1 1 and to the sensitized coating 7 7 . To this end a metal coated transparent buffer layer 17 may be interposed between the waveguide 1 and the sensitized coating 7 . Alternatively Figure 3 , a metallised optically matched grating 17 can be used in place of the buffer layer 17 or, the metallic medium Figure 4 can be of particulate form, each particle 17 having a sensitized coating 7 .
