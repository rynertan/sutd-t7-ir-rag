# TELEVISION VOICE MULTIPLEX SIGNAL REPRODUCING CIRCUIT.

## Abstract
A circuit for FM modulating the sum signal of a left signal and a right signal forming a stereophonic voice with the voice carrier of a main channel, receiving a television voice multiplex signal FM modulated by the voice carrier of a sub channel for the right signal and reproducing the left signal and the right signal. This circuit further rectifies and reproduces by a rectifier 29 an inter carrier signal with the beat of the voice intermediate frequency signal and the video carrier signal of the sub channel for the right signal, rectifies and reproduces by a rectifier 34 the voice intermediate frequency signal of the main channel for the sum signal, and produces by circuits 39 , 40 the left signal from the reproduced right signal and the sum signal. Since the sum signal is not reproduced by rectifying the inter carrier signal but is reproduced directly by rectifying the voice intermediate frequency signal of the channel, no buzz components are presented. Thus, the buzz components presented in the left signal led from a matrix circuit can be reduced to the same magnitude as that of the buzz components in the right signal.

## Description
SPECIFICATIONTitle of the Invention Television Sound Multiplex Signals ReproducingCircuitField of Art The present invention relates to a television sound multiplex signals reproducin circuit which reproduces right and left signals, R and L, respectively, upon receiving television sound multiplex signals of the type in which the sum signal R L of the right signalR and the left signal L is subjected to an FM modulation by sound carrier of main channel and the aforenentioned right signal is subjected to an F.s modulation by sound carrier of auxiliary channel, and more particularly, pertains to a television sound multiplex signals re producing circuit in which the effect of buzz interference is lessened.Background of Art According to West Germany s television sound multiplex system, signals are coosed in such a way that, as shown in Fig. 3, they are transmitted after main channel s sound signal has been subjected to an FM modulation by first sound carrier Fm having a frequency higher than video carrier frequency Fp by approx. 5.5MHz and auxiliary channel s sound signal by second sound carrier Fs having a frequency higher than the aforementioned video carrier frequency Fp by appro. 5.74MHZ, respectively. The carrier transmissionS are performed with the modulated main channels signal at a higher level than the modulated auxiliary channel s signal by the order of 7dB.Especially when transmitting the right signal R and the left signal L which conpose the stereo sound, the sum signal R L df these two signals R and L is transmitted as the aforementioned main channels sound signal and the right signal R as the auxiliary channels sound signal In Fig. 3, representation Or.. control signal is omitted and Fc stards for color subcarrier. Such a television sound multiplex signals reproducing circuit for receiving and reproducing television sound multiplex signals has hitherto been composed as shown in Fig. 1. Thus in Fig. 1, 1 denotes a tuner for receiving the aforementioned television sound multiplex signals Fig. 3 and converting them into intermediary frequency hereinafter abbreviated to IF signals.The output from this tuner, that is, IF signals, are entered ir,to an video IF amplifier circuit 3 through an IF filter 2. The output of this video IF amplifier circuit is entered into the next video detector circuit 4.This video detector cir uit 4 conducts the so called video detection and the video signals obtained by this detection are amplified by video amplifier circuit 5, to be delivered to an video driving circuit not shown in this figure as video output signal V. As the aforementioned video detector circuit 4, the so called intercarrier detection is performed simultaneously, in which the main channel s intercarrier signal and the au, ry cllqnnel s intercarrier signal resulting from beat between the respective sound IF signals of the main and auxiliary channels and the video carrier signal in the video IF signal are obtained from the aforementioned video detector circuit 4. The aforementioned main channels intercarrier signal has a central frequency at 5.5MHz with maximum frequency deviation 30 RHz and the aforementioned auxiliary channel s intercarrier signal has a central freauency at 5.74. 4Hz with maximum deviation 30KHz. As hereabove described, from the aforementioned video detector circuit 4, the main channel s and the auxiliary channel s intercarrier signals are together delivered and these two types of intercarrier signals are separated in the following manner. Thus at a first band pass filter 6, the main channel s intercarrier signal is extracted from the output signal from the aforementioned video detector circuit 4. This signal, after being amplified in the next intercarrier amplifier circuit 7, is subjected to an FM detection by main channel s sound detector circuit 8 and the main channels sound signal obtained thereby is delivered after being amplified by sound amplifier circuit 7.Similarly, at a second band pass filter 10, the auxiliary channel s intercarrier signal is extracted from the output signal from the aforementioned video detector circuit 4. This intercarrier signal, after being amplified in the intercarrier amplifier circuit 11, is subjected to an FM detection in auxiliary channels sound detector circuit 12 and the auxiliary channel s sound signal obtained cheered is delivered after being amplified by sound amplifier circuit 13. If the main channel s sound signal and the auxiliary channel s sound signal delivered respectively from the aforementioned sound amplifier circuits 9 and 13 corre spond to the so called dual sound such as mutually different two languages, etc., one or both of the main channel s sound signal and the auxiliary channel s sound signal is or are led to right and or left speaker s not shoin in this figure. However, when the aforementioned main channel s sound signal is the aforementioned stereo sum signal 2 L and the auxiliary channels 2 sound signal is the right signal R, these two signalsR L and R are entered into the next matrix circuit 14. 2 This matrix circuit 14, on one hand, directly delivers the introduced right signal R and, on the other, am plifies the introduced sum signal R L to a signal 2 twice as amplitude, and the aforementioned right signal R is, then, subtracted from this doubled sum signal R L. As a result, from this matrix circuit 14, the aforementioned right signal R and left signalL are delivered and the respective right and left signals R and L are individually led to the aforementioned right and left speakers. Now, one method to evaluate suc a television sound multiplex signals rorroducing circuit is to study the effect of buzz interference. The buzz interference is, as well kno√ßll, a phenomenon of change of frequency or phase of the video carrier signal which has occurred under whatever influence appearing as a noise in the sound signal, detected by sound detector circuit. This buzz interference poses especially a grave problen for receiving stereo broadcasting, where balancing of right and left sound is required. In the following, the circuit of Pig. 1 is discussed with reward to this problem when receiving stereo broadcasting. Now, the buzz component appearing in the output signal from the sound amplifier circuit 9 is assumed to be B1 and the buzz component appearing in the output signal from the sound amplifier circuit 13 B2, the main channel s sound signal entered into the matrix L R circuit 14 is represented by 2 B1 and the auxil iary channel s sound signal R B2. Accordingly, the left channel signal obtained by passing these two signals through the matrix circuit as hereabove described is indicated by L 2B7 B2.Since the respective intercarrier signals of the main channel and the auxiliary channel are derived on the basis of the same video carrier signal, the amplitude levels of the buzz components B1 and B2 of the respective main and auxiliary channels mar be considered nearly euaal, but the phases of these buzz components are not necessarilt in agreement. Accordingly, in the worst occasion, buzzes nearly equal in amplitude level B1 B2 B , but mutually opposite in phase may develop, the right channel signal being R B and the left channel signal L 3B.Then the buzz in the leftchannel is distinguishably louder, as compared with that in the right channel, disrupting the right and left balance of stereo sound. Thus this invention has been intended to solve the hereabove described problem in the conventional television sound multiplex signals reproducing circuit as shown in wig 1 and its object is to provide a television sound multiplex signals reproducing circuit which, when receiving stereo broadcasting, enables the buzz in the left channel signal to be lessened to nearly the same level as the buzz in the right channel signal, thereby to improve the right and left balancing degree of stereo sound.Disclosure of the Invention In the television sound multiplex sigr.als reproducing circuit of this invention, the output from the tuner for receiving television sound multiplex signals of the type described hereabove is fed to a first IF filter nd 7 second IF filter.The first IF filter extracts frorn the aforer.entioned tuner output sound I signal and video IF signal containing video carrier signal. And from the extracted sound It signal and the video carrier signal, respective ntercarrier signals of main channel and auxiliary channel are generated and from these two signals, auxiliary channel s intercarrier signal is separated and subjected to FM detection. As a result, auxiliary channel s sound signal, that is, the right signal R when receiving stereo broadcasting, is reproduced.At this time, the aforementioned detection is performed of the intercarrier signal, so the reproduced right signal generally contains son buzz component B. On the other hand, through the aforementioned second IF filter, the main channel s sound IF signal and the auxiliary channel s sound IF signal are together extracted from the aforementioned tuner output and the two types of extracted sound IF signals are fed to limiter circuit. At this time, by taking advantage of the fact that the aforementioned main channels soundIF signal is at a higher level than the auxiliary channel s sound IF signal, the main channel sound IF signal is separated in the aforementioned limiter circuit, thereby to subject tis .auin channel s sound signal to FM detection.As a result, main channel s sound signal, that is, the sum signal when receiv ing stereo broadcasting, is reproduced. At this time, the aforementioned detection is carrier out directly of the sound IF signal, so the reproduced suTti signal R 1 basically does not contain an buzz component 2 Accordingly, as the reproduced right signal R B containing some buzz component and the sunt signalL R containing no buzz component are passed through 2 the matrix circuit as hereabove described, the le t signal produced thereby is given by L B. For this reason, the buzz component in the left channel is reduced, as compared with the conventional circuit and oreover, the amplitude level of the buzz components in the respective right and left channels are nearly equal, the right and left balancing degree of stereo sound is, therefore, improved.Brief Description of the Drawings Fig. 1 is a block diagram showing a conventional television sound multiplex signals reproducing circuit Fig. 2 is a block diagram shoring an embodiment of the television sound multiplex signals reproducing circuit of this invention and Fig. 3 is a graph showing the composition of tele vision sound multiplex signals.The Most Preferable Form for Applying This Invention Referring to Fig. 2 showing an embodiment of the television sound multiplex signals reproducing circuit of this invention, 21 denotes a tuner siilr to that of the conventional circuit of i, 1. On one hand, the output from this tuner is entered into a first IF filter 22. This first IF filter permits video IF signal containing video carrier signal in the output from the aforamentioned tuner 21 to pass therethrough without attenuation, while letting respective sound IF signals of main channel and auxiliary channel pass therethrough with some attenuations. The respective signals abovementioned which have passed this first IF filter 22 are amplified by video IF amplifier circuit 23 and entered into video detector circuit 24. In the aforementioned video detector circuit 24, the detection of the video IF signal in the output from the aforementioned video IF amplifier circuit23 is per formed and the video signal obtained thereby is entered into video amplifier circuit 26 through sound trap circuit 25, to be amplified, and the output video signal V is led to video driving circuit not shown in this figure. Besides, the video signal from the aforemen tioned video amplifier circuit 26 is separately impressed on the aforamentioned video IF amplifier circuit 23 as a signal for automatic wain control AGC . The aforementioned video detector circuit 2 obtains the respective sound IF signals of the main channel and the auxiliary channel in the Output fron the aforamen tioned video IF anplifier circuit 23 and the video carrier signal in the video IF signal to perform the intercarrier detection, then, the output froin the aforementioned video detector circuit 24 containing the main channel s intercarrier signal central frequency, 5.5MHz and the auxiliarv channel s intercarrier signal central frequency, 5.74MHz is entered into band pass filter 27.Since this band pass filter 27 permits pass of the intercarrier frequency band of the auxiliary channel, the auxiliary channel s intercarrier signal is extracted by this filter 27 from the output from the aforementioned video detector circuit 24. This auxiliary channel s intercarrier signal, after being amplified by intercarrier amplifier circuit 28, is entered into the auxiliary channel s sound detector circuit 29, to be detected. In that way, the auxiliary channel s sound signal is reproduced and this auxiliary channel s sound signal is delivered after being amplified by sound amplifier circuit 30. The output from the aforementioned tuner 21 is entered into second IF filter 31, on the other hand.This second IF filter 31 is substantially so designed as to Permit the main channel s sound IF signal central frequency approx. 33.41Ez and the auxiliary channel s sound IF signal central frequency approx. 33.lb 4Fz of the output from the aforementioned tuner 21 to pass therethrough.The aforementioned two sound IF signals which have passed this second IF filter 31 are entered into liniter circuit 32 and from this limiter circuit 32, the main channels sound IF signal is separated and delivered Thus since according to the television sound muluiplc system being the theme of this invention, the main channel s signal is transmitted by carrier at a level approx. 7dB higher than the auxiliary channel s signal, the main channel s sound IF signal which is at a higher level may be separated by the limiter circuit 32, as the respective sound IF signals of the main channel and the auxiliary channel are extracted from the output from the aforementioned second IF filter 31 and entered into the aforementioned limiter circuit 32 while maintaining this. level relationship. The main channel s sound IF signal separated by the aforementioned limiter circuit 32 in this way is introduced into the main channel s sound detector circuit 34 after being amplified by narrow band amplifier circuit 33. This main channel s sound detector circuit 34 is designed to operate in an sound Ir banC 33.4MHz band , whereas the aforementioned auxiliary channel s sound detector circuit 29 is designer to operate in the intercarricr ar.d 5.74MHz band .Then the main channel s sound signal obtained by subjecting the output from the aforementioned narrow band amplifier circuit 33 to FM detection in the main channel s sound detector circuit 34 is amplified by the next sound amplifier circuit 35 and is, then delivered. Besides, the DC voltage in the output from the aforementioned main channel s sound detector circuit 34 is extracted by automatically fine tuned AFT voltage take out circuit 36 and this DC voltage is impressed on the aforementioned tuner 21 as AFT control voltage A. Thus when the local oscillation frequency of the tuner 21 undergoes a shift for whatever reason, the central frequency 33.4MHz of the main channel s sound IF signal changes, then, the DC voltage level in the output from the aforementioned main channel s sound detector circuit 34 is altered thereby, so that in response to the varying DC voltage level, the local oscillation frequency of the aforementioned tuner 21 is controlled constant. The reason why the respective sound IF signals of the main channel and the auxiliary channel are simultaneously taken out from the aforementioned tuner 21 through the aforementioned second IF filter 31 and from these two sound IF signals, the main channel s sound IF signal is separated by the aforementioned limiter circuit 32 is as follows Since the central frequencies 33.4MHz and 33.16zez of the respective sound IF signals of the main channel and the auxiliary channel hereabove mentioned are substantially high and are very close to each other, an IF filter of extremely narrow band is required in order to directly extract the individual sound IF signals from the output from the tuner 21. Such an IF filter is difficult to make and would be very costly, if one were produced. The sound detection of the main channel and the auxiliary channel is respectively carried out as hereabove described, so that when receiving stereo broadcasting, the auxiliary channel s sound signal or the sound amplifier circuit 30, while the main channel 9 right signal R is delivered from the aforementioned A sound signal or the sum signal R 5 is delivered from 2 the aforementioned sound amplifier circuit 35.At this time, the aforementioned richt signal R, which is obtained by detection of the auxiliary channel s intercarrier signal, as hereabove described, generally contains some buzz component iB. In contrast, the R L aforementioned sum signal 2 basically contains no buzz component, being derived fron direct detection of the main channel s sound IF signal, as hereabove described. Accordingly, when receiving stereo broadcasting, the output signal from the aforementioned sound amplifier circuit 30 is finally at R B and the output signal from the aforementidned sound amplifier circuit 35 at R L 2 These two signals are respectively introduced into the matrix circuit 37. The aforementioned matrix circuit 37 has a line 38 for directly delivering the output signal from the aforementioned sound amplifier circuit 30, subtraction circuit 39 for subtracting the output signal from the aforementioned sound amplifier circuit 30 from the output signal from the aforementioned sound amplifier circuit 35 and addition circuit s0 for adding the output signal from the aforementioned sound amplifier circuit 35 to the output signal from this subtraction circuit 39.Accordingly, when the signal R B containing the buzz component and the signal Ii R containing no buzz com 2 ponent are entered into this matrix circuit 37, the output signal from the subtraction circuit will be L R 2 B and, therefore, the output signal from the addition circuit 40 will be L T B. At this time, the signal delivered on line 38 will be R B. The aforementioned signals R i B and L 7 B respectively containing the buzz component B of nearly equal amplitude are fed to the respective right and left speakers not shown in this figure. In the case of the double voice broadcasting hereabove described, the auxiliary channel s sound signal from the aforementioned sound amplifier circuit 30 and the main channel s sound signal from the aforementioned sound amplifier circuit 35 are respectively directly delivered without being passed through the matrix circuit 37, therefore, the aforementioned auxiliary channel s sound signal contains some buzz component, while the aforementioned auxiliary channel s sound signal contains some buzz component, while the aforementioned main channel s sound signal does not. In this instance, however, such a buzz component poses no trouble at all, for the aforemrntion2d respective sound signals are individually heard. In place of the matrix circuit 37 of the aforementioned embodiment as shown in the diagram, an assembly of an amplifier circuit of 2 amplification degrees as hereinbefore described and a subtraction circuit may be ployed to achieve the equivalent effect. The present invention has hereinabove been described in connection with a basic embodiment, but its application will not be limited to this embodiment only, it may include varied compositions within the scope of claims as set forth hereunder
