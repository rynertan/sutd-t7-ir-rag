# Rotating conductor for transmitting an electrical signal from one member rotating relatively with respect to another member.

## Abstract
A conductor for transmitting an electrical signal from a signal generator 16 on a rotating member 10 to a signal detector 18 on a relatively stationary member 12 across the motion interface between the two members comprises at least one solid carbon graphite ring 20 mounted coaxially between the two members and having a first annular surtace S1 in intimate contact with a mating conductive surface on the rotating member that is electrically connected to the signal generator and hav ing a second annular surface S2 in intimate contact with a mating conductive surface on the stationary member 12 that is electrically connected to the signal detector 18 , said carbon graphite ring 20 functioning as an electrical interconnection between the two members.
