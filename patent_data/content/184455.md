# Bonding method.

## Abstract
A method of bonding a cemented carbide surface to a metal surface is provided. The method involves applying an alloy layer to one or both of the surfaces, the alloy comprising a major amount of nickel or copper and a minor amount of phosphorus, heat treating the alloy layer below its liquidus temperature to cause it to diffusion bond to the surface top to which it is applied and bonding the surfaces together by means of a braze alloy which preferably has a liquidus of no more than 750 C. The method has particular application to bonding cutting inserts to drill bits and cutting tools for mining machines.
