# Fluidic transformer apparatus with feedback.

## Abstract
An applied pressure Pl3 or volume change is intrinsical ly transformed into an output pressure or volume change which is related to the magnitude of the relative input quantity and a ratio of effective areas of pressure application surfaces of a plurality of pistons P1, P2, P3 in a fluidic transformer. The surfaces of the pistons are interconnected by fluid communication paths in a predetermined manner such that pressures existing in each of the communication paths P01, P02, P03 relate only to the input pressure P13 relative to the reference pressure PR and a ratio of the effective surface areas of the pistons P1, P2, P3 and such that the pistons are in a balanced force equilibrium state. The pressures present in the communication paths P01, P02, P03 can be operatively applied on opposite sides of fluid sealing elements of a plurality of sealing elements arranged in serial order to operatively seal between the applied pressure and the reference pressure. Each of the individual seal elements of a seal assembly is required to withstand only an increment of the overall pressure differential. The fluidic transformer maintains the incremental pressure across each seal element, and all seal elements in the assembly effectively resist what can be a very substantial difference between the input and reference pressures.
