## Description
The present invention relates to an automatic surveillance, guidance and fire fighting system or installation, and concerns a system or installation whose primary purpose is to prevent accidents and, in the event that they do occur due for example to aircraft fault or pilot error, to bring about the extinction of any fires which occur, in the shortest possible time, by means of the functional integration of surface telemetry and automated fire fighting. In the same way that other airport systems were designed and implemented in their time such as VASIS, ILS, CALVERT, etc. , all of which satisfactorily met the established requirements for achieving air safety, so also the present, newly designed system RUSTEM , meets other requirements in the same field, but within the airport precincts. In order to explain what the system comprises as well as the grounds which justify it, it is useful to set out the current state of affairs and accordingly introduce the necessary conceptual innovation in specific important aspects, being those which epitomize the characteristics of RUSTEM Runway Security and Taxiway Escort System . In effect, wherever there is an aircraft in operation, the concept of air safety and the necessary means of attaining this must be present, whether the aircraft is in the air or on the ground. Thus the concept of air safety covers the whole range of air air, air ground, ground ground and ground air circumstances. Likewise, if this approach is not taken, a gap in safety will occur in this relationship which may result in an accident, whilst the aircraft is in operation in any of the four circumstances mentioned above, transporting people, goods and fuel. It is well known in the air industry that from time to time serious accidents occur, although their prevention, and where necessary fire fighting operations, have been a priority effort of the aeronautical profession. The present system is part of this effort, though in this instance it is related to the airport environment, that is the ground ground situation. In this context it is appropriate to recall the accident which occurred in 1983 at the airport of Barajas Madrid , in which two aircraft collided on the ground. On this occasion, one aircraft was on its take off run, whilst the other aircraft in taxiing and trying to head for the start of the runway to take off in its turn, took a wrong turning and moving across a fast exit slipped into the middle of the flight path, where the collision occurred. At this time the airport was not under minimums, but visibility was poor so that the aircraft which was taking off did not see the intruding aircraft, neither did the latter see the aircraft taking off, nor did the tower at that time see either of the aircraft, all due to the length of the runways. This occurs in certain circumstances where the airport is operative but there is not clear visibility over the full distances. These situations, and many others, indicate conditions of a lack of air safety which require analysis and a complete solution of the problems to which they give rise. Furthermore, an aircraft in flight is not close to the ground, whilst in take offs, landings and taxiing, it is in contact with it and therefore is in a higher risk situation, in which safety conditions must be maximized. Since it is possible to set up ground installations in airports which could not be set up throughout a country, and since aircraft must operate in airports, it is clearly desirable to provide a safety system on runways and taxiways capable of guaranteeing this safety. The RUSTEM system is intended to meet this requirement. Also, the increase in modern air traffic, which leads at times to saturation in the number of operations per hour on an operative runway, has led to an increase in the risk of accidents, taking into account the poor visibility conditions which often occur. This expansion in traffic makes a built in airport safety system increasingly urgent and necessary, as the accidents in different airports of the world confirm. The same problem occurs in military air bases, where there is the additional problem that combat aircraft may enter the base in emergency conditions, for which reason telemetric monitoring and automated fire fighting thus become necessary. The RUSTEM system can be applied to both civil and military airport ground situations. Two damaging effects occur in an accident ruptures and fire. In accidents en route, the most important factor is usually ruptures, whilst generally in airport accidents fire is the cause of the greatest damage. This is due to the different velocity of the aircraft en route and in the airport, so that the dynamic impact is usually much greater in an accident in the air. On the other hand, once an accident has taken place in an airport, it is obvious that there is not the least remedy in the case of ruptures, causing damage to the aircraft and the passengers. However, the fire factor develops according to a specific process, and, fire being the determining factor in causing the greatest damage in airport accidents, it may be combatted because it is a process, provided of course that there are the necessary means for this, both in extinguishing capacity and in speed of activation, since without the latter condition the fire itself will put paid to the matter. From what has been said it emerges that the sole means of combatting the rupture factor is by avoiding the accident, as far as possible in the airport, within the present margin of possible aircraft faults or pilot error, for which reason prevention in this case lies in the area of telemetric monitoring, guidance and signalling on the ground. If, despite the measures taken, an accident occurs due to the aircraft or the pilot, the airport infrastructure must then have available an automatic fire fighting system for eliminating fires extremely rapidly, since fire is generally the most damaging factor in airport accidents. The research carried out in the quest for an efficient airport system which will meet these requirements, emphasized the necessity for integrating the surveillance and fire fighting functions into one single system. In fact, given the great speed required in fire fighting, this had to be of an automatic nature. Since an aircraft which has had an accident may become immobilized or its hot sections at any point of the surface in question, it was obviously necessary to have available the x,y coordinates of the aircraft or its sections. Hence it was necessary to integrate telemetric surveillance with automated fire fighting. Furthermore, if surface telemetry provides the x, y position of a damaged aircraft, or of its sections in the case of it being ruptured, this surface telemetry could also be used to obtain the position of normal aircraft, that is not in a state of emergency, in normal operation. With this, the conclusion was reached that a telemetric method had to be used in our system, both for the monitoring of normal aircraft and for establishing emergencies according to the various forms and circumstances in which these could occur in each instance, as for example fuel which has leaked and is on fire. As aforementioned, the fire fighting method has to be automatic due to the great speed demanded, since it is not just dealing with a simple fire, but with an aircraft carrying people, and loaded with highly inflammable fuel. Hence the designer s thinking has to be governed by the time scale, taking the second as the unit. Nevertheless, it is essential to point out that, regarding air traffic, two very different areas or environments must be considered in airports on the one hand the flight strips which contain the flight runways, one runway for each strip , and on the other hand the taxiways in their entirety, and the aircraft parking areas. The vast majority of airport accidents occur in the first mentioned area, where aircraft are running at great speed. In the second area, in the taxiways, aircraft are travelling slowly in procession and able to brake quickly where necessary, as is the case in the parking areas. This qualitative and quantitative distinction is taken into account in the present system, supplying the appropriate solution for the characteristics of each of the indicated environments. As will be seen, the current situation is analysed and, as a result of the limitations of tanker trucks as currently used in fire fighting , as well as the limitations of surface radar as used in surveillance in some airports , research into a new system which could completely solve these limitations, gave rise to the RUSTEM system, in which surveillance and fire fighting are functionally integrated in a single operational system, constituting an innovation in the airport field. An automatic aircraft taxi route selecting and traffic control system is disclosed in US 3706969, and may use an array of infrared sensors to detect position and or movement of aircraft. However the system appears to be dedicated to such a function insofar as the sensors are all located adjacent runway and taxiway intersections and in areas between the intersections there seems to be no surveillance. Furthermore EP 0117162 discloses an infra red surveillance system for detecting fires in a forest, in which each of an array of sensors is scanned over a field of view however in this case there appears to be no provision for tracking a moving heat source as it moves past the sensors. In the present system, which is set out in the appended claims, an array of thermal sensors under computer control is provided which is adapted to provide both the function of tracking a moving aircraft as it passes the sensors and the function wherein each sensor scans its locality so that the position of any heat source within a locality may be determined from the outputs of adjacent detectors. Thus the present invention has the advantage that a single sensor array may be operated and used in two ways for two different and necessary purposes. In broad outline, which will be explained in greater detail in the following pages, and taking into account the fact that statistically airport accidents occur on the flight strips in the vast majority of cases, a RUSTEM system can include the following elements Statistically, 99 of airport accidents, including situations where aircraft have previously announced their emergency status, occur within flight lanes. Therefore it is both logical and necessary for automatic hydrants to be installed within the said lanes, hydrants which due to their range and their three degrees of freedom, are capable of covering any emergency, being able to act both in treating the whole runway, as well as on specific points on the damaged aircraft, colliding aircraft, or their dispersed sections, eliminating heat sources, acting globally and simultaneously on all of them. The hydrants referred to are always without pressure and without electrical current. Thus, there is double protection against their being activated spontaneously. That is to say, if and only if, the tower activates the fire fighting system, do the telemetric sensors along the flight lane send the position and extent of the heat sources to the computer, and the anemometers send the wind force and direction with this data the computer system rapidly calculates the fire fighting parameters, i.e. selects the specific hydrants which will be activated and supplies them with the operating parameters corresponding to each of them, and it is then that the selected hydrants enter into operation, in a very few seconds, launching a large discharge of extinguishing fluid and rapidly suppressing the heat sources. While there is an aircraft in motion within the flight lane, whether in normal or emergency status, the system is locked and cannot operate. The fire fighting operation only occurs with a motionless aircraft. However, the hydrants can prepare the runway on the announcement of a damaged aircraft approaching the airport. Lastly, it was evident that an installation in accordance with the invention allows the possibility that the analogue type signals originating from the surface radar installed in an airport may be processed by the computer equipment of the said installation and incorporated as an additional element with regard to airport safety. The surface radar would act as one more sensor for the installation, its signals being used as additional data for the overall safety system. To this end, the aforementioned installation can be improved in the following manner j for airports operating in very low visibilities, some flight lane sensors, in addition to infra red sensing, incorporate an emitter and detector of electro magnetic pulses, or an ultrasonic active element, capable of detecting objects within the flight lane relating to aircraft or vehicles k for airports with normal or average visibility, the standard sensors not only pick up the aircraft located in the flight lane, but also vehicles penetrating it l there is the option of installing an interface capable of processing the signals originating from the surface radar which has been installed in an airport, and introducing such signals into the computer controlling the surveillance, and with this data making an addition to the functions of the system m there is the option that the installation s taxiing detectors may be generally activated simultaneously, and the sensing of aircraft and other objects may be carried out simultaneously, in this case means can be incorporated for discriminating aircraft from other objects, and maintaining the logical sequence in the guidance of each aircraft in the zone of movement and parking of aircraft and n there is the option that the piping and pressure storage tanks for water and extinguishing agents for the flight lane are divided up into independent modules, and their discharge is attained by means of the pressure of a compressed gas connected by regulating valves to the water and extinguishing agent storage tanks. The invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which The dispensing of the extinguishing fluid may be carried out at the foot of the hydrant, or at the start of the supply pipe in which case it could be single . References in this figure include Figure 5 represents a plan P and elevation E of a flight lane in which the variation in slope of the runway axis is seen. Also the position of the telemetric sensors is shown not to scale , forming successive rectangles or squares along the whole length of the flight lane, the successive rectangles thus being adapted both to the slopes and to the changes in gradient allowed by the OACI standard. Figure 6 is an illustration of the detection procedure while tracking an aircraft by means of infra red sensors along the flight lane, thanks to the position of the colliding beams and the corresponding signals for their processing by computer. Figure 7 is similar to the previous one, although here one sees a dangerous situation in having two aircraft within the flight lane, which could collide. One can see also the rectangles formed by each set of four telemetric sensors STI infra red sensored areas ISA . Figure 8 represents the tracking of an aircraft during the sequence of its entrance onto the runway. Figure 9 shows the sweep mode of the telemetric sensors ST along the flight lane SPZ . The sources in this case are motionless, three heat sources being represented, as well as the detection carried out by the four sensors from the four corners of the infra red sensored area ISA in question, allowing the surface dimensions of each heat source to be accurately defined. The sweep mode is that used in emergencies. Figure 10 shows an airport layout in which can be seen both the flight lane SPZ and the taxiways equipped with detectors D , guidance beacons B and traffic lights S . Inside the SPZ s neither detectors D nor traffic lights S are installed. However, at those points of the SPZ perimeter where taxiways impinge, the firstdetectors and traffic lights are installed, so that an aircraft is detected on leaving the runway. Full continuity in airport surveillance is thus achieved, since although an aircraft which exits from the area of the SPZ leaves behind the telemetric sensors ST tracking it, it will be immediately detected by the first taxiway detector D on entering the corresponding section of taxiway. Thus, in both cases, where the aircraft is inside the SPZ and where it is on any taxiway, it is immediately displayed on the main panel Pn located in the airport tower. Detectors D , beacons B and traffic lights S have been shown in the drawing. Moreover, although automated hydrants could be sited in other zones, other than in the flight lanes, this does not seem justified in view of accident statistics. Figure 11 represents a view of the system equipment located in the tower panel Pn , console Co , computers Or and connections Cn , as well as the position of the officer on watch in front of the controls. The panel Pn is of large dimensions and almost vertical, its angle of inclination being adjustable, for ease of observation both by the operator and by other tower personnel. Since it is necessary that all the controllers can see the aforementioned panel, it will be located in the upper part of the tower s large window, and for this purpose a small building modification will have to be made locally in the roof of the tower, allowing the panel to be housed in front of the controllers, so that the latter can both observe the panel and see through the tower s window. Also shown in this figure are The installation of the RUSTEM system does not involve alterations to the current consoles and installations, nor does it interfere with their operation or the work of the tower s flight controllers. Figure 12 represents the main panel located in the tower. Its dimensions are those which are appropriate and necessary to reflect the resolution and definition of sources of which the flight lane telemetric sensors ST are capable. The operation of both the flight lane computer and the computer dealing with taxiing is displayed on the panel Pn . When there are emergencies the telemetric sensors go into sweep mode and the reference symbols which appear directly on the panel are emergency circles. In tracking mode, the aircraft reference is seen on the panel as well as a reference which changes according to the actual path of the aircraft. Figure 13 illustrates an airport flight lane in which an aircraft and a motor vehicle appear. Figure 14 represents an airport layout in which the surface radar RS and control tower T are shown. Having planned the system under the conditions described above, it is now appropriate to take stock of the current situation in airports in general, since the problem is substantially the same in all countries. To start with the aspect of fire fighting. In all civil airports and air bases there is a fire station, equipped with tankers, prepared ad hoc . This originates from the early days of aviation, as an extension of the method used by municipal fire brigades and has been evolved by trying to adapt to requirements. Little by little, and despite the efforts made to improve it, its poor performance with regard to the special case of an aeronautical accident has become increasingly clear, as seen in practical cases. Protests by pilots associations and the frank pessimism of the aeronautical authorities devoted to this matter, confirm this situation in the various different countries. For various reasons, as aircraft have been developed they have increased in volume and weight, and therefore in engine power and size of fuel tanks, and can achieve much longer flights. This has caused airports to increase the capacity of the tankers in which water and special extinguishing agents are transported. This has already led to cases of enormous tankers, some of which have had to incorporate two engines, one in front and one behind. This would suggest that a limit has been reached in the method used. Also, given the volume which has to be transported, there have been actual instances where the tankers have overturned, since, although smooth, there are unavoidable gradients in the airport terrain. There are thus some limitations and interactions between the load transported, speed of travel of the vehicle and stability. Furthermore, if an accident occurs at the head of a runway, at the far end of the start of the runway, often muddy areas and other obstacles prevent or make difficult an approach close to the said accident. On occasion, the aeroplane or colliding aircraft, are broken into sections which are dispersed, thus requiring the said tankers to be able to attend to all the fires simultaneously and involving an increase in the fleet of trucks necessary. Moreover, the trucks cannot act on their own, but only when the airport tower so indicates. So that as in the majority of airports the surveillance function is deficient, as the tower first has to determine whether there is an emergency or not, a question which is often difficult and uncertain due to the lack of an instrument which can rapidly verify this, especially at night or in low visibilities. All this causes a build up of time which weighs heavily against a hypothetical fire and rescue operation, since first the tower has to determine whether or not there is an emergency, after that it has to notify the fire brigade and this has to be mobilized then the journey has to be made from the fire station to the site of the accident, at times far away as in the case of the heads of runways. Once the fire brigade have arrived, they have to take charge of the disaster which has occurred different each time, which is complicated in the case of dispersed sections. Thus, there is an excessive time lag which is inconsistent with the type of accident being considered. It is thus inevitable that performances have been low, losing human lives and increasing the damage to aircraft. When in the past, aircraft were much smaller, less global inefficiency was observed with this procedure, but currently this is continually on the increase, since it is actually the method and procedure used which have to be changed globally, both in theory and in practice. According to OACI publications extinction must be carried out in a period of five minutes, due to the fuel, its explosive capacity, and the toxic gases which may asphyxiate the passengers trapped in the accident. Currently, the OACI specifies between two and three minutes for starting up fast fire trucks after the alarm has been given. This clearly shows that between the five tragic minutes available and the two or three minutes for the mobilization of the high speed trucks, there only remain two minutes for the work of extinction, thus emphasizing the necessity for using a different method, like the RUSTEM system whose automated hydrants enter into operation in a few seconds after the fire rescue button has been pressed by the tower. In addition to the problems and limitations described, there are other problems which also act negatively on the efficiency of fire rescue operations, this time related to the rescue personnel themselves. These may be summarized as follows Also, having arrived at the site of the accident, on the one hand they are tied to the fire tanker, and on the other the accident has managed to produce a number of fire sources. Thus, each accident being different, they have to improvise their action on the way, often leading to psychological blocks in the face of the urgency of the various sources to be extinguished and their dispersal. The truth is that it is irrational and preposterous to completely, systematically and without exception, require heroism as an everyday norm for work. So that if the technician does not carry out his own self criticism, he will continue to maintain an error of principle and with it foreseeable low performances, as demonstrated in practical instances. It is absurd to deal with saving the life of the pilot by placing the lives of several firemen at risk in the attempt. As human beings their lives are as important as that of the pilot and to be respected equally with all others. If this is not agreed upon, the pilot may not be saved since fear will tend to paralyse the actions of the firemen, with predictable low performances. Thus, no matter what the quality of the fire tankers may be at a given moment, they have to be operated by firemen, whose actions are unpredictable. Faced with this set of problems, both in the method employed and those related to the rescue personnel, the conceptual modification intrinsic to the present system is based on the following So, concentrating for a moment on the fire fighting method described, the following advantages may be pointed out, amongst others This completes the explanation of the principal fire fighting concepts in the present RUSTEM system. Now consider the aspect of airport surveillance. The current general situation can be described as follows This very beneficial instrument was introduced to try to maintain air traffic running inspite of poor visibility conditions on an aircraft s approach to the airport. The ILS instrument landing system is, in fact, a landing instrument. The said instrument consists of an aerial which is located on the threshold of the runway, emitting signals which are picked up by an instrument on board, indicating whether the aircraft is to the right or left of the runway axis, as well as whether the aircraft in its approach is flying above or below the correct approach path. Hence, although the pilot cannot see the runway due to cloud, he carries out the landing on instruments, gradually altering his course until he is finally on the runway, landing in the touchdown zone. The runways which have ILS are called instrument runways, which on the ground have to meet the strictest OACI standards regarding widths, slopes...etc., with their respective flight lanes being wider a minimum of 300 metres . Thus, it may easily be appreciated that in the past, when there was no ILS, pilots did not land unless they had complete visibility regarding the runway. The tower also had this same visibility with respect to the aircraft trying to land. Put simply, both visibilities, that of the pilot and that of the tower were one and the same visibility. But, if suddenly the aircraft is given some electronic eyes with which the pilot can carry out the landing, without seeing the runway with his naked eye, there is a situation in which the operating minimums of this airport have been reduced, by which the aircraft is helped to land, but at the cost of leaving the tower blind if the tower has lost visibility over the complete airport environment. Together with this there is a situation of general risk in all ground operations, which negative effect was not taken into account when the ILS was introduced and its installation extended into all civil airports and air bases. In fact, although initially it would appear somewhat illogical, in reality the airport accident referred to previously at Madrid airport, in which two aircraft collided, was basically due to the existence of the ILS in the said airport, since although the ILS is a landing instrument, and in that accident there had been one aircraft landing and the other taxiing, both ground operations were being carried out in conditions of poor visibility, since the introduction of the ILS has lowered the operating minimums in all the world s airports. Neither aircraft saw the other, nor did the tower see either of the two by eye, nor did the tower see the collision, nor the place where both the colliding aircraft were to come to a halt in the flight lane. All the tower saw was fog and initially not knowing what had happened, lost time in calling the fire brigade who then had to look for the site of the accident, also in poor visibility. On this occasion, the general risk mentioned above became a disaster, with a corresponding loss of human lives and damage to the aircraft. This airport acident is symptomatic of the risk situation which has been highlighted and which it is essential to correct, because from time to time it costs the lives of passengers and pilots. Air safety embraces the whole environment, and it therefore also includes the ground ground area. The ILS comes under the air ground heading, but an airport is an organic whole as with any object in reality, so that it is connected. Accordingly, if only one part is considered without taking into account the rest, as happened with the ILS which was aimed exclusively at aiding landing , secondary effects may be, and, in fact, have been produced, such as that quoted of leaving airport towers blind. Aircraft in an airport cannot move without the proper instructions from the control tower, but if the latter are blind with respect to incidents occurring on the runways, the tower personnel seem to be in a contradictory situation where they have to control and direct surface traffic and at the same time are left blind and without any instrument allowing them to view incidents in the airport. This contradiction from time to time costs people s lives and must be corrected. That is to say, this is not an attempt to eliminate the ILS, since it is very beneficial, rather an attempt to provide the tower with a suitable instrument for carrying out telemetric surveillance in the airport, despite there being poor meteorological conditions, or that it is operating at night, as is usual. In fact, the day has arrived for so called surface radar, which instead of directing its beam into open space directs it towards the ground, sweeping the airport. However, this equipment is not suitable, nor is it included in the present RUSTEM system. Here the telemetric method will be something else. There are various reasons for this In the first place, surface radar emits its pulses from one point, the aerial. Secondly, the runway is not flat, but has gradients, even though limited and standardized. In addition, it should be taken into account that radar does not measure distances, but the time difference between the transmission of the pulse and the reception of its echo bounced back by the object, although since the pulse and its echo consist of electromagnetic radiation their velocity c is known, and since the time difference between the transmission and reception is known, the corresponding distance is obtained. But in this process, if the object located on a runway is such that this runway is horizontal, or else has gradients, the result will be that although the straight distance between both objects and the aerial is the same, nevertheless their respective coordinates with respect to runway axes will be different in x, y. This parallax effect is shown in Figure 4 . That is to say, standard surface radar falsifies the x, y coordinates of the object due to a parallax effect which appears when runways have gradients. These gradients are smooth, but as the length of runways is relatively great, the result is that often there is a very significant difference in height z between one end of the runway and the other, so that, in fact, the radar falsifies the corresponding measurement of the x, y position of the objects. These radars, which in themselves are not very economic due to their functional structure and the elements which they incorporate, would be even more expensive if an attempt were made to obtain the correct x, y coordinates, since in this case one would have to turn to a three dimensional radar accompanied by a correcting computer. Then the output signal from the 3D radar receiver would have to be corrected with the computer, which in turn would have to contain the topographical data of the different points of the airport. This would have to take place in real time so that this type of equipment would be more complex and more expensive, and therefore not very advisable. There is yet another problem which is that when speaking in general of airport or in flight surveillance, the concept persists that this telemetric surveillance will be with respect to normal aircraft, when in fact in the case of an airport, not only do the movements and stoppages of normal aircraft have to be monitored, but also the telemetric system has to supply data on emergencies and fires in case of accidents. In addition, it is vital to obtain via telemetry, the actual form of the fire sources which appear. Only in this way will the aiming and automated action of the fire fighting operation be efficient and accurate. That is, the surveillance function and the fire fighting function cannot be separated nor split off. Thus, considering the case of a fuel lake in flames, the result of an accident, three 3 negative factors emerge with regard to surface radar All these reasons make the use of surface radar inadvisable, since in the event of using it, these problems would distort the necessary telemetry. Furthermore, radar will give the sections of the aircraft, but in an airport accident these sections are of less interest since the rupture factor already has no remedy in this case, of greater interest instead in the telemetry of emergencies is the position of the heat sources, which will sometimes coincide with the sections and at other times not. For example, an aircraft could have its undercarriage broken off in an accident, and this part could be detected by radar. But this part is of no interest as far as the hydrants are concerned, only the fire sources which are the sole item which must be eliminated as quickly as possible after the accident has occurred. Thus, if the telemetry gives mainly the metal sections and not the heat sources, this telemetry would be completely useless and detrimental in this instance, since it would oblige the hydrants to have to act on sections and not on sources, the hydrants being thrown off track by a bad choice of the telemetric method used. Radar has been a great advance, but on every occasion the correct instrument has to be used which is consistent with the function demanding solution, without confusing the uses and functional possibilities of each instrument. Moreover, although surface radar distorts x, y positions, it is used to give a screen display which is often sufficient for surveillance exclusively. But if an automated fire fighting system is sought, those errors and difficulties which have been pointed out are disadvantageous, and another method of telemetry must be turned to, which naturally gives the correct x, y position of normal aircraft, but which also gives accurate data in cases of emergency, that is, with one and the same method, both functions must be brought about without duplicating the elements used. Again, it is essential to understand that an airport is divided into two zones which are completely different in function In fact, when an aircraft is in operation, it does not, nor cannot have any intention in the airport other than to move in one of two directions In a taxiway the aircraft travels very slowly and often in procession, where some aircraft follow others. But in the flight lanes and runways the situation is completely different, since this is the ground air or air ground transition area. In a taxiway an aircraft can stop sharply if necessary, but this is completely impossible on the runways. Thus, although the airport is an organic whole and its parts are interconnected, there are basic qualitative differences in these parts, and this differentiation therefore also has to be reflected appropriately in the telemetry system and its respective consequences and functional derivations. For example, 99 of airport disasters occur in the flight lanes, so that it makes sense for the automated hydrants to be installed in the flight lanes, but not in other airport areas. That is, although they could of course be installed, it would not make sense comparing the function cost relationship. The same thing occurs with the analysis of surface radar, since there are many zones of little or no conflict in the airport, and for these surface radar surveillance gives a totally disproportionate funtion cost relationship. Hence, this is another reason for the present RUSTEM system not using surface radar. Also, as indicated by the OACI SMGC requirements, surface radar will not be regarded as the determining element. This is due, among other reasons, to the fact that although the tower can observe the said radar screen, the pilots in the taxiway cannot see this screen. It is specified that the pilots be guided in situ , which requires detectors, guidance beacons and traffic lights at crossings, something which surface radar does not provide. Because of guidance and emergencies, the RUSTEM system does not make use of surface radar. As will be explained, two different methods will be used In their turn, these traffic lights, which are seen by the pilots when taxiing, are connected to each other, with the detectors described above, and with the tower. A general description of this aspect of the system is given below It emerges from all this that, for the reasons explained, surface radar is not the appropriate instrument, but rather the installation of telemetric sensors, detectors, axial beacons and traffic lights, as in the case of the described RUSTEM system, which to distinguish it from other airport systems has been called this for short, standing for runway security and taxiway escort system , in which three functions are considered surveillance, guidance and fire fighting. With this the tower actually recovers its functions. One could then have smaller, faster and cheaper fire tankers for taking care of possible fires in other airport zones, but used as an auxiliary measure with respect to the automated hydrant installation, as a much more powerful and faster system, as demanded by the aeronautical accident, this being able to take care of any type of emergency in the flight lanes which is where airport accidents tend to occur. This also reduces the general installation costs and those of maintenance, simultaneously achieving a high degree of reliability, speed, and simple and secure operation on the part of the tower personnel, who would thus have a working tool which they can use whatever the meteorological conditions, night time situation or traffic density, the RUSTEM system being adaptable to any airport. Lastly, as shown in Figures 13 and 14, especially in Figure 13, along the sides of the flight lane will be arranged a series of standard infra red sensors, Si, as well as some special infra red sensors, SiA, with an additional element for transmitting and receiving electromagnetic or ultrasonic pulses. The infra red rays, if, which leave the aircraft are picked up by both types of infra red sensors as the aircraft passes in front of them, and the data thus obtained is sent to the central computer of the installation fitted in the control tower, T Figure 14 . The two types of infra red detectors can pick up not only the infra red rays originating from the aircraft, but also the infra red rays, if, originating from any vehicle, vh, which is travelling along the flight lane. Also, as can be seen in Figure 14, the control tower, T, is linked in with the airport s surface radar, RS, Figure 14 also illustrating the normal infra red sensors, Si, and the taxiing and guidance detectors and beacons, D B. As a result of the present invention, the automatic surveillance, guidance and fire fighting installation for airport aircraft covers the whole spectrum of safety in an airport and is thus in the optimum position to meet the different safety emergencies which may arise in airport traffic.
