## Description
This invention relates to an apparatus for wrapping the balloon of a balloon catheter before the catheter is inserted into a patient. The use of balloon catheters in medicine is known. One of these balloon catheters is an intra aortic balloon catheter. An intra aortic balloon catheter is utilized in balloon pumping and consists primarily of two segments the balloon chamber or balloon, and the catheter tube. The catheter tube is a long thin hollow flexible tube, one end of which is fed into an artery of a patient and the other end of which remains outside the body. The balloon, which is sausage shaped, consists of a membrane attached to the end distal of the catheter tube that goes into the body. The end that remains outside the body proximal is equipped for connection to an external pump console. The console pumps gas, usually helium, through the catheter tube into the balloon. The balloon membrane of an intra aortic balloon catheter is not distensible. It does not stretch or contract but has a constant surface area irrespective of whether it is in its inflated or collapsed state. In use, the balloon of the device is maneuvered by a physician so that it is positioned in the descending aorta, the major artery leading from the left ventricle of the heart to the other organs of the body. It is normally inserted into the body, however, through the femoral artery, which is located in the groin area of the thigh. From there, by pushing on the catheter tube itself, the physician can feed the balloon up through the arterial system until it reaches the aorta. The balloon is then inflated and deflated again and again, out of phase with the natural pumping action of the heart. That is, immediately after the heart relaxes following a pump cycle, the balloon is inflated and just before the heart begins the next pumping action the balloon is deflated. This process is often called counter pulsation. The timing of the inflate deflate cycle is controlled by the patient s electro cardiogram or arterial blood pressure so that it is properly synchronized to the patient s natural heart rhythm. When the balloon is inflated, it forces blood out of the portion of the aorta where the balloon is located. In so doing, the inflation of the balloon causes a second pumping action, supplementing the natural pumping action of the heart. In particular, it forces extra oxygen containing blood through the coronary arteries, thereby providing additional nourishment to the heart. Thereafter, when the balloon is deflated, the pressure in the aorta is lowered. Since there is then much less back pressure against which the heart must pump, the exertion of the heart muscle during the next pumping cycle is substantially reduced. The intra aortic balloon catheter is a temporary assist device, typically being left in the patient for about three days. It is frequently used after open heart surgery to help wean a patient off a heart lung machine. It is often used for patients suffering from cardiogenic shock, myocardial infraction and acute angina pectoris and is frequently used to sustain patients who might not otherwise be able to sustain themselves until permanent treatment can be affected. The original intra aortic balloon catheters were inserted by surgeons via a surgical procedure. The femoral artery was surgically exposed by making an incision in the groin. A second incision then was made in the artery, a graft was sewn in and the IAB inserted. Removal of the device requires surgery as well. In surgical balloon catheters, the catheter tube itself ran the entire length of the balloon. In other words, the far distal end of the balloon was fixedly secured to the far end of the catheter tube and the near proximal end of the balloon was also fixedly secured to the catheter tube. Today most intra aortic balloons are inserted by cardiologist without the need for surgery. These intra aortic balloon catheters are inserted by puncturing the artery with a needle instead of using a surgical incision. This procedure is called percutaneous insertion. See Seldinger, In percutaneous insertion, the patient is given a local anesthetic, after which a small incision is made in the skin over the femoral artery. A hypodermic needle then is used to puncture the femoral artery. The needle is replaced by a guide wire, over which is inserted a sheath. The percutaneous intra aortic balloon catheter is introduced into the artery through the sheath. The smaller the diameter or profile of the balloon catheter as it was being inserted into the femoral artery and being fed up into the aorta, the better. Making this entering profile small, however, has presented difficulties because the non distensible balloon membrane does not contract when deflated. Since the membrane of an intra aortic balloon does not contract, some other methods were employed to make the entering profile as small as possible. With surgical intra aortic balloons this was accomplished by bunching or wrapping the balloon membrane around the catheter tube within it. Because the catheter tube was within the balloon, however, no matter how tightly bunched the balloon could not be made any smaller than the tube itself. In the early percutaneous intra aortic balloon catheters, the profile of the balloon was further reduced by instead of attaching both ends of the balloon to the catheter tube, attaching only the proximal end of the balloon to it. Then a very thin rod or support member ran from the tip of the balloon through the balloon and terminated in the catheter tube. The support member also was rotatably coupled to the catheter tube at the proximal end of the balloon so that the other end of the balloon could be twisted relative to the proximal end. By permitting the support member to rotate, it was possible, after evacuating air from the balloon to twist the balloon membrane into a spiral wrap about the support member. Because the support member was much thinner than the catheter tube when the balloon was wrapped about the support member, it thus was made to have a diameter as small as that of the catheter tube. Since the physician guided the wrapped balloon catheter up to the aorta by pushing on the catheter tube, a disc shaped keeper preventing the support member from sliding or telescoping into the catheter tube was added, thereby permitting the pushing force to be transmitted from the catheter tube through the support member and to the balloon tip. Certain difficulties were experienced with these early percutaneous intra aortic balloon catheters. Since the balloon was wrapped after placing a vacuum on the balloon catheter and manually rotating the support member, the resulting spiral on the balloon tended to be uneven and non uniform. Often the balloon was over wrapped by rotating excessively thus inducing torsional stress and fatigue on the balloon and creating a potential for the balloon to rupture in the patient during subsequent balloon inflation and deflation. Moreover, the early percutaneous intra aortic balloon catheters were unwrapped in the aorta of the patient by removing the vacuum previously placed on the balloon catheter. Due to the characteristics of the balloon material this allegedly permitted the balloon and its attached support member to unwind and return to their original unwrapped condition. There, however, was no accurate way to make certain that the balloon fully unwrapped in the aorta. Should the balloon not unwrap fully, proper counter pulsation could not be achieved. The balloon catheter would have to be removed and a new balloon catheter inserted. In later percutaneous intra aortic balloon catheters, The present invention constitutes a further improvement in the technique of wrapping an intra aortic balloon catheter. With the present invention, a wrap handle is no longer necessary to achieve positive controlled wrapping and unwrapping yet the problems associated with the early percutaneous balloon catheters not having wrap handles still are avoided. The wrapping apparatus according to the present invention comprises a housing having a channel to receive at least a portion of the balloon and clutching means at least a portion of which is located in the channel for exerting a predetermined pressure on the balloon to to aid in the wrapping of the balloon as the wrapping apparatus is rotated relative to the balloon catheter yet to permit relatively free rotation of the balloon within the channel after the balloon has been wrapped. Thus, the clutching means in the wrapping apparatus avoids the potential of over wrapping the balloon. The clutching means can include a shoe and biasing means for biasing the shoe towards the balloon membrane with a predetermined pressure while the balloon membrane is being wrapped, yet enable the balloon membrane to rotate relatively freely or slip within the wrapping apparatus after the balloon membrane has been wrapped by a predetermined degree. The clutching means, alternatively. can include at least one flexible vane projecting within the channel such that the vane contacts the balloon membrane during wrapping and provides predetermined pressure onto the balloon membrane which aids in wrapping yet permits the wrapped balloon membrane to rotate relatively freely or slip within the wrapping apparatus. In accordance with the invention, the intra aortic balloon catheter is evacuated and inserted into the wrapping apparatus. The wrapping apparatus is rotated at least by a predetermined number of turns relative to the balloon membrane thereby wrapping the balloon membrane therein. The resulting wrap is uniform, tight and of a sufficient narrow profile to enable percutaneous insertion into the body of a patient. The invention thus provides a safe, user friendly, and simple method for wrapping intra aortic balloon catheters, which avoids the problems associated with early percutaneous intra aortic balloons, particularly problems of over wrapping and unwrapping. The wrapping apparatus includes a housing having a channel to receive at least a portion of the balloon membrane of the intra aortic balloon catheter. The wrapping apparatus also includes a clutching means located in the channel for exerting a predetermined degree of pressure on the balloon membrane to aid in the wrapping of the balloon membrane as the wrapping apparatus is rotated relative to the balloon catheter yet permit relatively free rotation of the balloon membrane within the wrapping apparatus after the balloon membrane has been fully wrapped. The housing can include an upper portion having a passage and a lower portion having a passage with the two housing portions secured together so that their passages form a channel for surrounding at least a portion of the balloon membrane. In one embodiment, the clutching means comprises a shoe and a biasing means for biasing the shoe toward the balloon membrane with a predetermined pressure while the balloon membrane is being wrapped. The shoe has a first surface portion which is accurately configured to contact and conform with the diameter of the balloon membrane as the balloon membrane is being wrapped. The first surface portion of the shoe also can contain at least one rib which contacts the balloon membrane and aids in the wrapping of the balloon membrane as well as the ultimate removal of the wrapped balloon membrane from the wrapping apparatus. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the wrapping apparatus includes an elongated housing having a channel passing the length of the housing to receive and surround at least a portion of the unwrapped portion of the balloon. The wrapping apparatus also includes at least one flexible vane means projecting from the housing into the channel for exerting a predetermined pressure on the balloon membrane while the balloon membrane is being wrapped by rotating the wrapping apparatus relative to the balloon catheter. The vane means also is of sufficient flexibility to bend and thereby permit relatively free rotation of the wrapped balloon membrane within the wrapping apparatus after rotation of the wrapping apparatus by at least a predetermined number of revolutions. In a further modification to the above embodiment, the vane means projects into the channel to divide the channel into at least two passages which communicate with each other. The leaves of the unwrapped balloon membrane occupy one of the passages while the central section of the balloon membrane occupies the other passage. In a more preferred embodiment, the clutching means comprises at least two flexible and generally opposing vanes projecting tangentially inwardly within the channel such that the vanes contact the balloon membrane during wrapping of the balloon membrane and provide a predetermined pressure onto the balloon membrane which aids in its uniform wrapping yet permits the wrapped balloon membrane to rotate relatively freely within the wrapping apparatus. As the balloon membrane is wrapped and the resulting diameter of the balloon membrane increases, a portion of the vanes flexes radially outwardly from the balloon catheter while providing counter pressure onto the balloon membrane which aids in the uniform wrapping of the balloon membrane. In another preferred embodiment, there is at least one shoulder located within the channel and having a length sufficient to contact the fully wrapped balloon to maintain the balloon membrane at a predetermined position during wrapping and aid in the removal of the balloon membrane from the wrapping apparatus after the balloon membrane has been fully wrapped. Preferred embodiments of the invention are described hereinbelow with reference to the drawings wherein FIGS. 1 and 2 illustrate an intra aortic balloon catheter wrapping apparatus 2 of the present invention. Wrapping apparatus 2 includes an upper housing portion 4, a lower housing portion 6, a channel 8 with side passages 10 and 12 and a central passage 14, and clutching means 16 with a shoe 18 and biasing means 20. Upper housing portion 4 is releasably secured to lower housing portion 6 thereby forming channel 8 therein. Channel 8 passes through the entire length of wrapping apparatus 2, and clutching means 16 is resiliently secured within central passage 14 of channel 8. In particular, biasing means 20, which for example consists of a foam rubber strip or a spring, is secured permanently to shoe 18, and the resulting clutching means is secured resiliently within central portion 14 of channel 8 to permit biased movement of clutching means 16 within said channel. FIG. 2 also shows a representative unwrapped percutaneous intra aortic balloon catheter 22 which can be wrapped by wrapping apparatus 2. Intra aortic balloon catheter 22 includes balloon membrane 24 with side leaves 26 and 28, catheter tube 30, y 32 and support member 34. Y 32 is connected to proximal end 36 of catheter tube 30, and distal end 38 of catheter 30 is sealidly connected to proximal end 40 of balloon membrane 24. Distal end 42 of balloon membrane 24 is connected to tip 44 of support member 34. Support member 34 passes from tip 44 through balloon membrane 24, through catheter 30 and into y 32. Support member 34 is fixedly secured to y 32. Intra aortic balloon catheter 24 is evacuated and inserted into channel 8 of wrapping apparatus 2 such that its side leaves 26 and 28 are positioned within side passages 10 and 12, respectively. The positioning of unwrapped intra aortic balloon catheter 22 in wrapping apparatus 2 can readily be seen in Fig. 3. FIG. 3 illustrates a cross sectional view of wrapping apparatus 2 with intra aortic balloon catheter 22 positioned therein in an unwrapped configuration. Leaves 26 and 28 of intra aortic balloon catheter 22 respectively are positioned within side passages 10 and 12 of channel 8. Shoe 18 presses upon such leaves due to the biasing forces exerted on it by biasing means 20. More particularly, shoe 18 includes a first surface 46 having an arcuate center surface 48. Surface 46 is in frictional contact with at least portions of leaves 26 and 28 respectively and is opposed by surface 47 of channels 10 and 12. Center section 48 has a sawtoothed or ribbed configuration so as to aid in wrapping and in sliding intra aortic balloon membrane 24 in and out of wrapping apparatus 2. Central passage 14 of channel 8 also includes a lower central surface 50 of central portion 14 which has an arcuate sawtoothed or ribbed configuration to aid in wrapping and in sliding balloon membrane 24 in and out of wrapping apparatus 2. The sawtooth configuration of surface portion 48 and 50 aids in the uniformness and tightness of the wrap of balloon membrane 24 by adding to the frictional forces being applied to balloon membrane 24. Sawtooth arcuate surfaces 48 and 50 also aid in the ease of removal of the fully wrapped intra aortic balloon catheter 22 from wrapping apparatus 2. With these surfaces, balloon membrane 24 can be more easily advanced along the length of wrapping apparatus 2 because the ribbed shaped surfaces 48 and 50 decrease contact area to thereby reduce surface friction for sliding thereon along the length of wrapping apparatus 2 in the longitudinal direction. After balloon membrane 24 with side leaves 26 and 28 has been disposed within and surrounded by channel 8 of wrapping apparatus 2, the wrapping apparatus is rotated around the longitudinal axis of intra aortic balloon catheter 22 i.e., about support member 34 by at least a predetermined number of rotations while the balloon catheter is held in a relatively stable position. As wrapping apparatus 2 is rotated about balloon membrane 24, torque is transmitted to balloon membrane 24 for twisting leaves 26 and 28 about themselves and support member 34. As the leaves wrap about support member 34, they thus advance along side passages 10 and 12 toward central passage 14 and rotate about each other so as to form a spiral. Frictional drag forces are exerted on advancing leaves 26, 28 by first face surface 46 of shoe 18 and opposing surface 47 which creates an outwardly directed tension along the leaves. This assures a tight uniform wrap. As the spirally advancing leaves increase in diameter, they contact arcuate surfaces 48 and 50 creating frictional drag forces therebetween. These drag forces are sufficient to maintain tangentially directed tension along the spiralling leaves to assure their tight, uniform wrapping. With the diameter of the spiralling leaves increasing shoe 18 is pushed away from central passage 14 toward biasing means 20. In turn, biasing means 20 exerts a counter pressure on shoe 18 sufficient to maintain frictional contact between arcuate surface 48 of shoe 18 and spiralling leaves 26 and 28. This surface contact is sufficient to maintain tension on the spiralling leaves to assure a tight, uniform wrap. In view of the preselected pressure exerted by biasing means 20 into shoe 18 which in turn is transmitted onto leaves 26 and 28 of balloon membrane 24, controlled wrapping of the balloon membrane 24 within central passage 14 is achieved. After a certain number of rotations, leaves 26 and 28 are fully wrapped around support member 34 and the above described tension on the spiral is sufficient to overcome the drag forces. Additional rotation of wrapping apparatus 2, thus, does not provide significantly additional wrapping of balloon membrane 24. FIG. 4 illustrates fully wrapped balloon membrane 24 within wrapping apparatus 2. As can be seen, leaves 26 and 28 are fully wrapped around support member 34 in a spiral fashion and shoe 18 has advanced upwardly away from lower housing portion 6 and support member 34 and toward biasing means 20. The thickness of biasing means 20 has decreased to compensate for the advance of shoe 18 toward biasing means 20. As seen in FIG. 4, the outer diameter of the wrapped balloon membrane 24 has a surface configuration which is substantially similar to that of arcuately shaped center section 48 of first surface 46 of shoe 18. As seen in FIG. 4, after leaves 28 and 26 are fully wrapped about support member 34 a friction clutch like action results wherein wrapping apparatus 2 can rotate substantially freely about fully wrapped balloon membrane 24 and balloon membrane 24 does not achieve any significant increase in wrapping. The balloon catheter thus cannot be over wrapped and therefore the problem of balloon ruptures and tearing due to wrapping too tightly is avoided. In the above described embodiment, wrapping apparatus 2 including upper housing portion 4 and lower housing portion 6, and shoe 18 preferably is made of machinable, injection moldable or extrudable polymers e.g. polyethylene, polypropylene, polycarbonate or polyacetals . Biasing means 20 preferably is made of a foam rubber or springs secured to shoe 18. Upper and lower housing portions 4 and 6 preferably have a length of about 24 cm 9 3 4 inches and a diameter of about 16 mm 5 8 inches . The shoe is about 3 mm 1 8 inches high and 10mm 3 8 inches wide. FIGS. 5 and 6 illustrate another preferred embodiment of an intra aortic balloon catheter wrapping apparatus of the present invention. There is shown a wrapping apparatus 102 which includes an upper housing portion 104, a lower housing portion 106, a channel 108 with side passages 110 and 112 and a central passage 114, and clutching means comprising flexible vanes 117 and 119. Upper housing portion 104 is secured releasably to lower housing portion 106 thereby forming channel 108 therein. Channel 108 passes through the entire length of wrapping apparatus 102, and clutching means, by way of vanes 117 and 119, projects into central passage 114 of channel 8 and passes the entire length of channel 108. Vanes 117 and 119 are integrally formed as parts of upper housing portion 104 and lower housing portion 106, respectively. Such vanes 117 and 119 are configured and dimensioned to be resilient yet flexible so as to move toward or away from the center of the cross section of wrapping apparatus 102 within central passage 114. In FIGS. 5 and 6 there additionally is shown shoulders 121 and 123 which project into central passage 114 and run the entire length of wrapping apparatus 102. FIG. 6 also shows a representative percutaneous intra aortic balloon catheter 22 which is substantially identical to the catheter described with regard to FIG. 2. FIG. 7 illustrates a cross sectional view of wrapping apparatus 102 with intra aortic balloon 22 positioned therein in an unwrapped state. Intra aortic balloon catheter 22 is inserted into channel 108 of wrapping apparatus 102. Leaves 26 and 28 of intra aortic balloon catheter 22 respectively are positioned within side passages 110 and 112 of channel 108. Vane 117 projects from a point 125 generally adjacent the circumference of upper housing 104 into central passage 114 and in a direction generally tangential to the center of central passage 114. Similarly, vane 119 projects from a point 127 generally adjacent the circumference of lower housing portion 106 into central passage 114 and in a direction generally tangential to the center of central passage 114. Vanes 117 and 119 are substantially flexible and flex about points 125 and 127 respectively in a direction away from the cross sectional center of central passage 114. Shoulder 121 projects from a point 129 adjacent the circumference of upper housing portion 104 into central passage 114 and in a direction toward the center of central passage 114. Similarly, shoulder 123 projects from a point 131 generally adjacent the circumference of lower housing portion 106 into central passage 114 in a direction generally toward the center of central passage 114. Shoulders 121 and 123 need not be flexible. They are used to centralize intra aortic balloon member 24, and its support member 34, within the center of central passage 114. Shoulders 121 and 123 also aid in the sliding removal of fully wrapped balloon catheter 22 from wrapping apparatus 102. The functioning of vanes 117, 119 and shoulders 121 and 123 can be seen with reference to FIG. 8 and is comparable to the functioning of shoe 18 and biasing means 20 as described above. After evacuated balloon membrane 24 with side leaves 26 and 28 has been disposed within and surrounded by channel 108 of wrapping apparatus 102, and leaves 26 and 28 thereby are positioned within side passages 110 and 112 respectively, wrapping apparatus 102 is rotated about the longitudinal axis of intra aortic balloon catheter 22 by at least a predetermined number of rotations as balloon catheter 22 is held in a relatively stable and fixed position. With reference to FIGS. 7 and 8, wrapping apparatus 102 preferrably is rotated in the counter clockwise direction. As wrapping apparatus 102 is rotated about balloon membrane 24, torque is transmitted to balloon membrane 24 for twisting leaves 26 and 28 about themselves and support member 34 thus forming a spiral. As the leaves wrap about support member 34, they advance along side passages 110 and 112 toward central passage 114. Frictional drag forces on the side walls of channels 110 and 108 create an outwardly directed tension along leaves 26 and 28. This assures a tight uniform wrap. As the rotation of the wrapping apparatus 102 continues, the resulting spiral begins to increase in diameter and the spiral contacts the side of flexible vanes 117 and 119 forcing such vanes to move outwardly from the center of central passage 114. This maintains a frictional drag force on the spiral yet permits the diameter of wrapping balloon membrane 24 to increase in size. Flexible vanes 117 and 119 generally pivot about points 125 and 127, respectively, but are of a configuration and dimension to provide firm control and drag pressure onto spiralling balloon membrane 24 to maintain a tight, uniform wrapping of the balloon membrane 24 as wrapping apparatus 102 rotates about intra aortic balloon catheter 22. In view of their configuration, vanes 117 and 119 are biased such that the pressure on such vanes caused by the increasing diameter of such wrapping balloon membrane 24 creates a counter pressure onto balloon membrane 24 by such vanes. During the beginning of the wrapping process, vanes 117 and 119 thus contact balloon membrane 24 and continue to remain in contact for the remainder of the wrapping. The resulting frictional drag forces between the vanes and the spiral are sufficient to maintain tangentially directed tension along the spiraling leaves to assure their tight, uniform wrapping. In view of the pressure exerted by vanes 117 and 119 onto the spiralling balloon membranes 24, controlled wrapping is achieved. After a certain number of rotations of wrapping apparatus 102, leaves 26 and 28 are fully wrapped around support member 34 and the above described tension on the spiral is sufficient to overcome the drag forces. Any additional rotation of the wrapping apparatus 102, thus, does not create significant additional wrapping of balloon membrane 24. When balloon membrane 24 is fully wrapped about support member 34 as shown in FIG. 8, the balloon membrane generally is positioned between shoulders 121 and 123. Such shoulders aid in the centralizing of the wrapped balloon membrane 24 within central passage 114. They also aid in the sliding of wrapping apparatus 102 along the longitudinal axis of balloon membrane 24 during the removal of wrapping apparatus 102 from around wrapped balloon membrane 24 in the same manner that sawtoothed arcuate surfaces 48 and 50 of wrapping apparatus 2 and in removal of its balloon catheter. As seen in FIG. 8 after balloon membrane 24 is fully wrapped, balloon membrane 24 is positioned between vanes 117 and 119 and shoulders 121 and 123. Since leaves 28 and 26 are fully wrapped about support member 34, a friction clutching action occurs wherein wrapping apparatus 102 fully continues to rotate or slip about fully wrapped balloon membrane 24 but no significant increase in wrapping occurs. Balloon membrane 24, thus, cannot be over wrapped, which avoids the prior art problem of balloon ruptures and tearing due to wrapping too tightly. In the above described embodiment, wrapping apparatus 102 including upper housing portion 104 and lower housing portion 106 preferably is made of machinable, injection moldable extrudable polymers e.g. polyethylene, polypropylene polycarbonate or polyacetals. Preferably the mold for upper housing portion 104, including vane 117 and shoulder 121 integrally formed thereon, is identical to the mold for lower housing portion 106 with its vane 119 and shoulder 123 integrally formed thereon. Preferrably, upper and lower housing 104 and 106 are about 24 cm 9 3 4 inches and about 16 mm 5 8 inches in diameter. The length and thickness of the vanes, channels and shoulders vary depending on the size of the balloon to be wrapped and the material selected for the wrapping apparatus. For a polyethylene wrapping apparatus used with a 12 French intra aortic balloon catheter, the vanes are about 5 mm 0.02 inches in thickness and 0,65 mm 0.25 inches in height. Side passages of the channels are about 10 mm 0.04 inches and shoulders are about 20 mm 0.08 inches in thickness and 0,35 mm 0.14 inches in height. For example, shoe 18 and biasing means 20 of wrapping apparatus 2 can be an integral component consisting of one material which is biased toward leaves 26 and 28 of balloon membrane 24. Side passages 10 or 110 and 12 or 112 could have different configurations then as shown. For example, instead of the upside down U shaped configuration as shown in FIGS. 3 and 4, side passages 10, 12 and 14 could have an modified S shaped configuration or a spiral shaped configuration. instead of the modified N shaped configuration as shown in FIGS. 7 and 8, channels 110 and 112 could have a U shaped, a straight line or S shaped configuration. Vanes 117 and 119 need not be an integral part of upper housing portion 104 or of lower housing portion 106 respectively but could be additional elements fixidly secured onto such housing portions. These vanes could be replaced by a biasing means and shoe similar to that described with regard to FIGS. 1 and 2 and those components could be secured within central passage 114 so as to contact the wrapping balloon membrane 24. Moreover, vanes 117 and 119 need not be positioned with their lengths tangential to the circumference of the spiralling balloon member 24. The length of the vanes could be positioned perpendicular or anything in between as long as they are sufficiently flexible to bend and permit spiralling of balloon membrane 24. Moreover, while above discussions concerned rotation of wrapping apparatus 2 and 102 about intra aortic balloon catheter 22 as the balloon catheter is held stationary, the wrapping apparatus could be held stationary and intra aortic balloon catheter 22 rotated therein by a predetermined number of turns so as to wrap balloon membrane 24 within wrapping apparatus 2 or 102. Alternatively, the wrapping apparatus and the balloon could both be rotated in opposing directions. It also is contemplated that the inventive wrapping apparatus be utilized with all major commercially available intra aortic and other balloon catheters. These other catheters include pulmonary arterial balloon catheters and percutaneous translumenal angioplasty e.g., coronary artery, renal artery and the like . To achieve a uniform, tight wrap, it is preferred that support member 34 of intra aortic balloon catheter 22 be held relatively stationary in relation to the wrapping apparatus as balloon membrane 24 is wrapped. In other words, support member 34 should be made stationary by being non rotatable with regard to balloon membrane 24. For example, the support member could be fixed to both ends of the balloon or the support member could continue through catheter 30 into wye 32 and be rigidly fixed therein to generally preclude its rotation. The wrapping apparatus of the present invention also would work particularly well with the balloon catheter described in U.S. Patent 4,362,150 to Lombardi et al. provided the wrapping handle shown therein is held or prevented from rotation as the present wrapping apparatus is rotated about the balloon membrane and it support member. While the inventive wrapping apparatus preferably is utilized with percutaneous intra aortic balloon catheters, the wrapping apparatus of the invention can be utilized with surgical balloons if a surgeon would desire a more uniformed wrap than was available prior to the present invention. In the surgical balloon, the support member 34 of FIG. 2 is merely replaced by an extension of catheter 30 into and through the entire length of the balloon and attached to tip 44 of the balloon catheter. The inventive wrapping apparatus would surround the balloon and wrap in the manner described above. The inventive wrapping apparatus also need not have the cylindrical configurations as shown in the embodiments but can take on additional configurations such as for example, square, multi sided, or ribbed. The inventive wrapping apparatus also can be used in conjunction with various shipping trays which have been utilized previously to hold an unwrapped intra aortic balloon catheter during packaging and shipping to the physician. A tray also could be reconfigured to accept at least a portion of wrapping apparatus 2 and it could be shipped with the intra aortic balloon catheter placed in an unwrapped state within the wrapping apparatus with the leaves of the balloon membrane positioned in the side passages of the wrapping apparatus. The tray could be configured to allow the doctor to rotate the wrapping apparatus within the tray while the tray itself generally secures the intra aortic balloon catheter from rotation.
