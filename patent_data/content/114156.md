A reversible plough comprises a main frame and at least one pair of plough bottoms 80 located above and be low each other, respectively, one of said plough bottoms being left turning and the other being right turning. The plough bottoms of each pair are synchronously rotatable on a substantially horizontal, common axis of rotation 71 . To make possible change of the plough bodies without doubling of any other essential parts of the plough than the plough bottoms 80 the axis of rotation of the plough bottoms is located on a lower level than the main frame is.
