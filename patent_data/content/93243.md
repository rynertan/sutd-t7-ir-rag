# Job recovery method in a document copier machine.

## Abstract
A document copier machine with an automatic docu ment feeder ADF combined with a semiautomatic docu ment feeder SADF is operated according to a job recovery procedure in which multiple originals may need recopying in order to replace copies destroyed when a jam occurs. The procedure calls for feeding the required number of originals needed for recopy through the SADF and once the jam recovery is complete, automatic restarting of the ADF occurs in order to complete the job interrupted by the jam.
