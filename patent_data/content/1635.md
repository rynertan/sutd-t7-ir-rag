## Description
CURABLE POLY ER COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING GLYCOL ETHERS As A REACTIVE DILUENT The invention relates to the use of a reactive diluent in common coating compositions made up of hydroxy functional resins which are curable, by means of an amino plast or phenolic resin, upon heating in tile presence of a strong acid catalyst. Presently, low boiling diluents are employed as solvents for coating compositions and are removed upon heating said compositions in the curing process. In United States Patent 3,238,160, Hensen, March 1, 190, alkyd resins are cured with various formaldehyde base resins from a solvent of 150 C 300 C boiling point. The amount of solvent is at least 2 3 times tie amounts employed herein. United States Patent 3,920,595, Anderson et al, November i8, 1975, teaches solvent based alkyds cured with aminoplast resins. The solvents described are alkanols and polyols. United States Patent 4,038,225,Takaya et al, July 26, 1977, shows hydrocarbons, alkanols and low boiling glycol ethers as solvents for an alkyd aminolast coating system. The instant invention comprises standard coating mixtures of non aminoplast hydroxy functional resins in admixture with arainoplast or phenolic curing agents therefor and 2 catalyst for the reaction between the two and, as a reactive diluent, a polyglycol monoether which boils at 1500C at 760 mm mercury pressure, preferably at 3006C or greater. The invention composition differs from the solvent based coatings previously employed in the art in that it may be permanently incorporated, preferably with about 80 percent or greater and more preferably about 90 percent or greater retention, in the final coating instead of being evaporated as is commonly the case, and the resultant coatings do not suffer losses in their physical properties as might be expected. The invention is a curable coating composition comprising A 100 parts by weight of a non aminoplast hydroxyl bearing polymer which represents x hydroxyl equivalents B 10 to 60 parts by weight which represents y hydroxyl equivalents of a polyglycol monoether represented by the formula EMI2.1 wherein R is a hydrocarbyl group of 1 to 20 carbon atoms,R is independently hydrogen or methyl, and n is a positive number, said polyglycol monoether having an atmospheric boiling point of about 1500C or greater C an aminoplast or phenolic resole resin, capable of curing component A to a tack free state, present in a quantity such that z equivalents of said resin are present, z being equal to from x y up to x 2.5y and D a catalytic amount of a catalyst which catalyzes the reaction between components A and C . Preferably, the invention is directed to the above composition containing from 10 to 100 parts by weight of component B having an atmospheric boiling point of at least 3000C, and containing z equivalents of component C , where z is equal to from 2 x y to lO x y . The invention further comprises the above composition which has been heated at a temperature and for a length of time sufficient to cure same to a tack free finish. The inventive composition may optionally comprise a pigment of the nature commonly employed in paints and other compositions as well as other common additives such as flow control agents and wetting agents. The terlts x, y and z will be explained in the following description. Component A of the invention is suitably any hydroxyl bearing polymer which is commonly cured with an aminoplast or phenolic resin o form films and coatings. Component A suitably has at least two and preferably three or more free hydroxyl groups. Such polymers are the free hydroxyl containing polyesters or alkyds such as are obtained by condensing di or polycarboxylic acids with diols, glycols, triols or higher polyols in such a manner and using such ratios that free hydroxyls remain unreacted for further curing by means of the aminoplast resin. Solid epoxy resins, such as extended diglycidyl ethers of bisphenols, for example EMI3.1 wherein m 1, are also suitable as component A . Another class of polymers suitably employed as component A are those obtained by polymerization of the unsaturated portion of vinyl monomers which bear or may be modified to bear free hydroxyl groups which are ultimately pendant from the polyethylenic backbone. Examples cf such polymers are polyvinyl alcohols which may be obtained by the hydrolysis of polymers derived from the polymerization of vinyl acetate, with or without other vinylic unsaturated comonomers, from poly hydroxyalkyl acrylates such as poly hydroxyethyl acrylate and poly hydroxypropyl acrylate, with or without other comonomers, and poly a,ss unsaturated acids derived from the polymerization of ,ss unsatu rated monomeric acids, with or without other co.monomers, or by the polymerization and subsequent hydrolysis of esters thereof. Such monomeric acids include acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, itaconic acid, maleic acid, citraconic acid and cinnsmic acid. Component A polymers bearing the necessary hydroxyl functional groups have an equivalent weight which may be calculated by standard methods. For the purposes of this invention, 100 parts by weight of said polymer has arbitrarily been designated as x hydroxyl equivalents. For example, if a given polymer is known to have an equivalent weight of 20 grams per equivalent, in the inventive composition comprising 100 grams of said polymer, x equals 5. This number x is used together with another arbitrary function y for component B to determine the appropriate amount of component C to be employed in the inventive composition. This is discussed more fully below. For the purposes of this invention, free carboxylic acid groups, COOH, should be considered as one hydroxyl functional group and oxirane groups as two hydroxyl functional groups. Component B comprises about 10 to about 60 parts by weight, preferably from 10 to 103 parts by weight, more preferably about 20 to about 85 and most preferably about 30 to about 70 parts by weight, of a polyglycol monoether represented by the formula EMI4.1 which has an atmospheric boiling point i.e., the boiling point at 760 mm mercury of about 3000C or greater. Such polyglycol monoethers are well known in the art and are prepared by reacting ethylene oxide, propylene oxide or mixtures thereof with an initiator ROH to give a mixture of products of varying lengths in the oxyalkylene chain.For this reason, n represents a statistical weight average indicating the average number of oxyalkylene units per mole of the monoether product. The chainEMI5.1 may consist of oxyethylene units alone, oxypropylene units alone, or mixtures thereof, in either block or heteric arrangement which is determined by either sequential addition of ethylene oxide or propylene oxide or random addition thereof. Preferably, R is methyl in the instant compositions. This is preferred to provide sufficient water resistance in a cured composition. Preferably, n is about 4 or greater and most preferably from 4 to 4.3. R is the hydrocarby3 group remaining trom. the initiator molecule and is suitably selected from alkyl, alkenyl, alkaryl, aralkyl and aryl groups comprising 1 to about 20 carbon atoms.Preferably, R is alkyl of 1 to 15 carbon atoms, phenyl, or alkylphenyl of 7 to 15 carbon atoms and Inost preferably R s an alkyl group of 1 to 4 carbon atoms. In one preferred embodiment, the number of carbon atoms in R and cssmbined total about 12 or greater. Some exam pulls of suitable monoethers for component B are shown in thj following table together with their approximate atmos ph i ic boiling points. TABLE I COMPONENT B Approx. Atmosph. Boiling Point R R n OC CH3 all CH3 5.5 3670CH3 all CH3 4.3 3070C13H28 all H 3 3500 C4H all CI 3 8 3500 Preferably, component B has an atmospheric boiling point of about 3100C or greater. Component C is an aminoplast or phenolic resin, capable of curing component A to a tack free state, and is unreactive in the composition under normal conditions but becomes reactive with component A at elevated temperatures on the order of 1000C 2500C, preferably 1250C 2000C for a time sufficient to create the desired tack free state, usually about 5 60 minutes or more.Suitable curing agents are aminoplast resins such as melamine formaldehyde condensation products or urea formaldehyde condensation products commonly available for this purpose and phenolic resole resins derived from the condensation of phenols and aldehydes and which are commonly used to cure the hydroxy bearing solid epoxy resins previously described. Melamine formaldehyde condensatior products, such as hexa ,nethovymethyl melamine, give products of superior quality in the invention. The quantity of component C to be employed is such that z equivalents of the aminoplast or phenolic resin are present in the invention composition, z being equal to from x y up to about x 2.5y. The equivalent weights of aminoplast and phenolic resins are commonly available from the manufacturers thereof. Knowing the hydroxyl equivalents present in components A and B , the amount of çcmporeni C can then be calculated on the basis of z which is derivable from x and y. Preferably, z is equal to from 2.5 times the sum of x y to lO x y .More preferably, z is less than about 8 x y , and is most preferably less than 7 x y . As the examples illustrate, varied amounts of aminoplast curing agent, Component C , are needed to attain better than about 90 percent retention of Component B . Roughly, for the polyester of Examples 1 3 and 13 15, z x y will be about 2 or greater for the acrylic of Examples 4 8 about 3.5 or greater for the epoxy of Examples 9 10 about 6.5 or greater and for the acrylic of Examples 11 12 about 3 or greater. Component D is a catalyst which catalyzes the reaction between the hydroxyl bearing component A polymer and the aminoplast or phenolic curing agent which is component C . Suitably, any strong acid may be employed for this purpose. Typical such catalysts are organosulfonic acids or their amine salts, sulfuric acid or its amine salts, zinc fluoroborate, phosphoric acid and boron trifluoride, or its etherate . An organosulfonic acid or its amine salt such as toluenesulfonic acid is preferred as component D .Suitably, about 0.05 to about 2 parts by weight of component D are sufficient to catalyze the curing reaction, and preferably more than about 0.1 and preferably less than about 1 part by weight is employed. The curable composition of the invention is suitably prepared by simply mixing the four components in any order at ambient temperature or slightly elevated temperatures less than the temperature required for the curing reaction. The curable composiio of the invention may suitably be heated to about 500C 1000C without effecting a premature cure. This facilitates handling, mixing and application of the invention composition. If desired, standard pigments such as titanium oxides, chromium oxides and zinc oxides may be added in suitable amounts to impart a desired color to the invention composition.Similarly, surfactants, wetting agents or flow control agents may optionally be added to the composition as is common in the art. The invention composition is applied to a substrate by any suitable means to form a film or coating thereon, and the film or coating is then heated to the curing temperature by means commonly used in the art such as a hot air oven or a bank of infrared heat lamps. The following examples serve to illustrate the compositions of the invention and the curing and use thereof for the preparation of films and coatings. Unless otherwise designated, the term parts when employed herein means parts by weight. Hot tack is measured by drawing a wooden tongue depressor across a cured coating immediately after curing. If no mark is visible, the coating is considered tack free.Example 1 Polyester Based Compositicn Five grams of a commercial polyester containing 10 percent ethoxyethyl acetate is blended with 1.64 grams polypropylene glycoi monomethyl ether, which is a component B represented by the formula EMI8.1 2.43 grams hexamethoxymethyl melamine is added as component C , this amount being such that z is equal to 2.0 x y equivalents, and 0.09 grams of a 96 percent sulfuric acid solurion is blended in with the other three components. This composition is cast ds a film on an aluninm panel and cured at 1500C for 5 minutes.The cured film exhibits no hot taclc, has a Gardner reverse impact resistance of about 30 inch pounds 34.6 kg cm and shows good solvent resistance. A weight loss of 14 percent occurs and 100 percent of component B is retained in the coating.Control Run A In the manner of Example 1, a composition of like makeup is prepared except that component B is replaced with an equal weight of ethoxyethyl acetate and the quantity of component C is reduced to 1.93 grams, the amount of curing agent such that z is about equal to 2.3 x y . A film is cast and cured in the same fashion as in Example 1. The cured film had no hot tack, a reverse impact resistance of 20 inch pounds 23.0 kg cm and good solvent resistance. However, there was about 37 percent weight loss upon curing, or about 100 percent of the volatiles, including the solvent.Examples 2 and 3 and Control BPolyester Based Compositions In the same manner as Example 1 Control A, a control and two compositions of the invention are prepared, coated and cured under the same conditions and utilizing the same materials for components A , B , C and D as in Example 1.
