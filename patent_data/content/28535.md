## Description
METHOD FOR ENSILING FEED AND THE ADDITIVE USED FORTHE METHOD The present invention relates to a method for producing silage and to the additive used in the method. Feed ensiling methods have been known for a long time, where feed is treated with different kinds of acids or their salts either together or as compounds, and the feed produced in this way is stored under nearly airless conditions. It is also known that sugars added to the feed will direct the microbic functions of the ensilation process in a favourable way and will further the production of a good feed. The method in question has been suggested among other treatments in CanadianPatent No. 355,191, where the sugars were obtained by hydrolysing wood products. The wood sugars are considered in the patent more favourable than cane sugar or beet sugar. The advantage of the method is that the hydrolysate contains the acid used in the hydrolysis which lowers the feed pH, which in turn affects the ensilation in a positive way. The use of wood molasses, that is a solution derived from the waste liquor from sulfite pulping by ultrafiltration and evaporation, to grain and mash ensilation, has been treated in the articles listed below. Wood molasses has a low MW fraction of the original sulphonised lignin and a higher proportion of sugars.Maataloustieteellinen Aikakauskirja AgriculturalPeriodical Vol. 50, 1978, pp 206 211,Maija Liisa Salo Wood molasses as the additive of fresh grain ensilation Puumelassi tuoreviljan sailontaaineena . A mash solution evaporated to a DM dry matter content of about 55 was used in the trial. From this solution about 2 3 of the originally included lignin sulfonates had been dehydrated. The pH of the solution was about 2. Amounts of the solution corresponding to 0, 10 and 20 of the feed DM weight were added to the feed and the feed treated in this way was preserved under certain trial conditions in batches that were nearly anaerobic and others which contained air. The trial results showed that the wood molasses, as a reserve material, is suitable for the anaerobic ensilage of fresh grain and mash, although the appearance of mould on the surface of the silage was a problem.Due to the large amounts of solution used it was possible to get a lower pH in the feed also with the above acidic solution, which further improved the ensilation. The article mentions the favourable effect of the sugars included in the solution. e.g. the wood sugars, propionic acid and acetic acid on the anaerobic ensilation. The feed obtained in the trial could be classed as very good ensiled feed. British Patent No. 1,266,648 describes a method, in which grain is treated with an aqueous solution containing lignin sulfonate, acid, and a wetting agent . The aim of this treatment is to have the grain treated chemically and physically so that its nutritive value, especially as regards starch would be more perfectly utilised by the animals. By the above treatment the grain pericarp was made softer so that the treating solution acted upon the starch layer to form a gel.This type of chemical pre treatment is in many cases a substitute for mechanical hot treatments which have earlier been used for the preliminary manufacturing of feed grain in a form that can be better utilised by the animals. The preliminary treatment in question will also make mechanical treatments much easier, in cases where this is still regarded as necessary. A treatment duration of 1 2 days, was suggested, so that ensiling was not intended. In the above methods no attention has been paid to the feeding value of silage or to the problem of preserving silage during the whole ensilation period. On the other hand special attention has been paid to the feeding values of the feed in ensilation methods where formaldehyde has been used. It has been proved that formaldehyde has a positive effect on the feed nutrients, primarily when it comes to the protection of proteins against ensilation losses quantitatively and qualitatively. Unexpectedly we have discovered that spent liquor from pulping contains products that influence the ensilation of feed in a positive way, especially the preservation of protein when the feed is ensiled under anaerobic conditions. According to one aspect of the invention there is provided an additive to be added to animal feed such as grass, grain or mash prior to anaerobic ensiling characterised in that the additive comprises lignone sulphonate in acid or in totally or partially, non toxically, neutralised form, together with a mineral and or organic acid or a non toxic salt of such acid s . According to another aspect, there is provided a method Of ensiling animal feed such as grass, grain or mash in which the feed is treated with an additive to improve palatability and reduce losses in nutritive material characterised in that the feed is treated with lignone sulphonate SL in acid or totally or partially non toxically neutralised form together with a mineral and or organic acid or a non toxic salt of such acid s , the SL calculated as dry matter being added at a rate of 1.5 to 15 g 100g crude protein. The additive may consist essentially of dry lignone sulphonate 1i0 700 g l in acid or neutralised form mineral acid 0 9 eq l organic acid 0 16 e l The total acid content being from 2 16 eq i. It may include lignone sulphQnate as 15 40t w w specified in claim 2, calculated as dry matter hydrochloric acid 10 35 w w calcuated as 37 w w concentration formic acid 10 40 w w. calculated as 85 w w concentration The acid or salt used in the method may be added at a rate of 0.05 to 1.0 eq 100g crude protein based on the acid equivalent weight . Preferably mineral acid and organic acid are each added at a rate from 0.02 to 0.6 eq 100g crude protein. When applied to grass or like fresh cut vegetable matter, the rate of application on the basis of dry lignone sulphonate is preferably from 0.6 to 5 kg tonne. The spent liquor from pulping otherwise called lignone sulphonate is obtained after pulping in the form of a weak aqueous solution containing little DM.This solution can be transformed or evaporated into a solution that is better suitable to the ensilation of feed and will then contain 30 70 DM S.G. 1.22 . Such a solution usually contains sulfonised lignin otherwise known as lignosulphite or lignosulphin about 12 55 , sugars lignose and reducing sugars about 20 60 , hemicellulose and sugar acids e.g. lignoceric acid about 18 25 , organic acids mainly C1 C6 aliphatic carboxylic acids about 4 12 as well as smaller amounts of other compounds e.g. sodium sulphite and or dioxan.The spent liquor may originate from sulphate cooking or sulphite cooking. Sulphite cooking includes both acidic sulphite and bisulphite pulping, and the pulping base used is not critical as regards the invention. The tree species used in the pulping is not critical, but naturally the composition of the spent liquor will vary depending on the tree species. The composition of the spent liquor may vary for instance in acidic birch sulphite cooking within the following limits TABLE 1 sulfonised lignin 42 55 of the DM hexose sugars 4 10 of the DM pentose sugars 16 22 of the DM sugar acids 8 10 of the DM acetic and formic acid 7 12 of the DM The sulphur content is about 5 6 of the DM, which is favourable in the feed ensilation solution, because the ruminant often suffers from a lack of sulphur.The tree species used in the cellulose industry are Scots pine, spruce, and birch. The pentose sugars of the spent liquor coming from the birch cooking are almost totally made up of xylose, whose derivative, e.g. xylitol, has been used with great success as a feed additive in order to improve the absorbtion of the nutrients and among other things for the control of ketosis British Patent 1542802 . It is also possible to obtain sulphonised lignin commercially in the form of a solid medium brown powder resulting from partial neutralisation with calcium or sodium hydroxide, and such products have been used with success within the scope of the invention. Such products are referred to hereinafter as calcium lignone sulphonate CaSL and sodium lignone sulphonate NaSL . Typical quoted analyses are as follows in percent by weight TABLE 2 CaSn NaSLMoisture 5 5Ash 11 21 Wood sugars 40 reducing sugars 13 pH of 5 w w aqueous 4.7 5.2 solution Hereinafter the following abbreviations will be used to avoid confusion of terminology lignone sulphonate generic SL lignone sulphonate in the usual acid SLA form 30 70 aqueous solution Calcium lignone sulphonate CaSLSodium lignone sulphonate NaCL. In the ensilation trials that we have made we have unexpectedly found out that when relatively small amounts of the sulphonised lignin whether in neutral or acid form are used together with different kinds of acids or salts they have a very favourable effect on the ensilation. There is good preservation of the feed protein and the ensilation losses of protein have stayed low both quantitatively and qualitatively. Acids used together with the SL may comprise a generally known acid or a mixture of these. The acid may be used totally or partially in the form of its salt, suitable cations including ammonium, sodium, calcium, potassium and magnesium. It is then possible to use the material for the whole ensilation in dry form. Useful acids include formic acid, acetic acid, butyric acid, isobutyric acid, valeric acid, isovaleric acid, caproic acid, benzoic acid, citric acid, sorbic acid, lactic acid, fumaric acid, acrylic acid, hydrochloric acid, phosphoric acid, and sulphuric acid. C1 C6 aliphatic carboxylic acids are preferred. The different acids have not been shown to influence the ensilation result very much when reacted or mixed according to the form of SL employed. The use of some free acid is preferred, because although the feed proteins could be preserved well simply by using the spent liquor, the other ensiling functions are not always sufficiently effective. Although for instance SLA is extremely acid, the amount used in our invention is still so small that at useful levels of addition the free acid content of the mere lignone sulphonate has little impact upon the pH of the feed.The amount of added free acid is preferably larger when a neutralised derivative of the sulphonised lignin is used. However good results have been obtained without the addition of free acid where e.g. calcium formate is used. The invention is also very favourable economically, as large amounts of spent liquor from cellulose pulping are available and its disposal constitutes an environmental problem. The technology of collecting the spent liquor from sulphate pulping has been developed economically, and at the current price the spent liquor is a remarkable source of raw material where it is put to use by the present invention. The sugars of the spent liquor also influence the ensiling functions of the feed in a positive way, and the feed is augmented by them and by minerals otherwise lacking to the animals. The trial results have shown that when ensiling feed in accordance with the invention, the amount of water soluble nitrogen in the ensiled feed is notably reduced. The amount of water soluble nitrogen compounds in the feed is a good indicator of the extent to which the feed proteins have been broken down during ensilation into small molecular compounds which are less valuable as food. This influence may be compared to that achieved for instance by using formaldehyde or tannin. The amount of soluble nitrogen in the feed normally varies depending on the fertilisation of the grass, weather conditions, harvesting and ensilation technique, and the content of nitrite, nitrate, ammonia, amide as well as other soluble compounds of nitrogen will vary greatly as a result of these factors.When ensiled according to the invention, the above breakdown of the protein can, however be substantially prevented. The following examples depict results obtained with the invention. The results shown that the significance of the invention is multiple 1. A hygienically good feed is achieved by which it it is possible to accomplish efficient animal production.2. The storage losses of the silage are quantitatively reduced.3. The nutrients are preserved in a favourable form.4. It is possible to utilise economically a bi product whose properties are environmentally difficult.5. The product of the invention has, as can be proved, also a nutritional effect. This concerns especially the lignone sulphonate.6. The method of ensiling is economically favourable.7. The method of ensiling is generally favourable also from an ensilation and a feeding point of view. 8. The ensiling has a particularly favourable effect on the preservation of protein. The following examples illustrate the invention. The trials took place at six different farms. EXAMPLE 1 On June 15th, 1978 grass feed having a dry matter content nominally of 15 30 w w was produced for silos of 1000 kg. The treatments and the results are given in the table below. 5 1 tonne of the following mixtures were applied to the grass by a conventional liquid applicator Mixture I formalin 37 55 acetic acid 80 30 stabilising solution 15 34 w w urea in water Mixture II formic acid 85 100 Mixture B1 SLA 50 DM Table 1 40 200 g l DM hydrochloric acid 30 3.6 eq l 37 w w 12.2 eq l formic acid 85 w w 30 6.6 eq l 22.1 eq l Mixture B SLA 50 DM 100 The silos were opened on August 7th, 1978 and were fed to bulls to be slaughtered. The feeds smelled fresh, they were palatable and the animals ate them willingly. TABLE 3Analysis of the ensiled grass at opening 1 pH sugar NH4N sol.N Butyric kg f.u. w w tot.N tot.N acidMixt.

This is clear from the column showing watersoluble N. The same effect to a lesser degree is evident with pure sulphonised lignin. It can also be observed that poor ensiling results were obtained with SL alone. This appears from the large amounts of butyric acid and ammonia nitrogen, as well as from the lower sugar content. A synergistic effect is indeed demonstrated, since the results, as regards pH and ammonium nitrogen, produced by Mixture B1 are better than the arithmetic mean of Mixture II formic acid alone and Mixture B SLA alone . pH is 4.6 3.6 or 22 lower, and soluble nitrogen is 5.1 2.6 or 49 lower, The same trend is visible in water soluble nitrogen.EXAMPLE 2 Three sample feeds as in Example 1 were produced for silos of 3000 kg August 3, 1978 . The treatments were as follows 1. Mixture I from Example 1 5 1 tonne grass .2. SLA 50 DM 2 1 tonne formic acid 85 w w 2.5 1 tonne of grass 55.25 eq tonne crude protein .3. SLA 50 DM 5 1 tonne of grass formic acid 85 w w 2.5 1 tonne of grass. The results as measured on the grass and animals were as follows 20 November 1978 TABLE 3 pH kg f.u.

At the same time the digestibility will usually sink. From this trial one can surprisingly enough establish that the SL for example 2 1 tonne 2.6 kg tonne or 5.2 g SLA 50 DM 100 g of crude protein gave a clearly better result together with 2,5 1 of formic acid.An SLA ration 2.5 times as large with the same acid addition gave a slightly poorer result. It is known that ensiling losses can be reduced by using a silage additive containing formaldehyde and acid British Patent Nos 1276677 and 1518808 .Unexpectedly it has been established that SL and acid has a similar effect. A larger ration of SL caused slightly greater crude protein losses. When silage additives of the type of treatment 1 containing formaldehyde are compared to trials with formic acid alone the differences found have usually been clearly larger than the variations above, i.e. more than 5 .EXAMPLE 3 Three silage samples generally as in Example 1 each of 1200 kg were prepared August 22, 1979.

There did not, however, seem to be a big difference between the different acids.EXAMPLE 5 Grass feed nominal 15 30 DM was ensiled for about 5 weeks in silos of about 5 kg and a variety of treatments applied. The compositions of the treatments are given in Table 6 and the rate of application and results in terms of soluble nitrogen total nitrogen are given in Table 7.

On the other hand if the amount of SL is increased to more than 25g SL lOOg crude protein no further advantage is achieved. All feeds were blameless with respect to quality, and their pH varied between 3.8 and 4.2. In the trial treatments mixtures of SL and acids were used. When only SLA was used point , 17.2 g SL lOOg crude protein , which would seem to be the optimumrate, poor results were obtained. The amount of soluble nitrogen was large and moreover the feed contained an appreciable amount of butyric acid.EXAMPLE 6 Grass samples having a dry matter content of about 20 were ensiled for 1i months in laboratory silos of about 5 kg capacity aftei being subjected to the following treatments Trial No. Treatment w w Application RateA NaSL 60 5 1 tonne 37 hydrochloric 20 2.4 eq l acid 85 formic acid 20 4.4 eq l B NaSL 50 5 g tonne Calcium formate 50 54 eq.acid tonne C No additive Applied with a solids applicator.
