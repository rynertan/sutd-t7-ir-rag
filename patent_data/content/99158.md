# A device for controlling a brush commutator assembly of an electric machine.

## Abstract
A method and a device for controlling a brush commutator assembly of a machine under application of a processing and control unit, by sensing one or more operating parameters of the electric machine, the sensing values being processed and converted into one or more control signals controlling the operation of the brush commutator assembly 2, 14 to provide an optimal com mutation process of tne machine current. The machine current I is sensed and the pressing exerted on the brushes is controlled by a fluid under pressure the brush tracks, moreover, being switched on and off upon increase and decrease of the machine current respectively in order to maintain an optimal current density in the brushes. One or more sensors for sensing operating parameters of the electric machine are used and a processing and control unit to process the signals sensed by the sensors and to supply control signals to one or more control means 31 28, VA, VB, VC, K1, K2 controlling the operation of the brush commutator assembly. The control device comprises a fluid control circuit having an electrically controllable pressure system. The sensors are operable to detect a.o. the machine current I , the temperature T of the cooling air and or of the commutator, the humidity of the cooling air, the commuta tion noise on the machine current, the speed of revolutions, and extreme mechanical vibrations.
