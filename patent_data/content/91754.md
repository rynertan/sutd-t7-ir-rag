# Apparatus and method for manufacturing ovenable paperboard articles.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus are disclosed for imparting a desired shape to a paperboard blank 84 . The blank 84 is formed between two dies 86, 88 for a sufficient length of time and with sufficient force to set the form, while moving the dies 86, 88 in tandem along a predetermined portion of a reciprocation path. Because the formed blank 84 remains in dwell while the dies are moving in tandem, it is not necessary to hold the dies stationary 86, 88 to ensure permanent formation of the blank. This allows greater production speeds.
