# Electrical power control apparatus.

## Abstract
An electrical power control apparatus in which power to a load 15 is shared between a plurality of semiconductors, one of which, T , is shown. Each semi conducter T forms part of a separate servo loop comprising, in its simplest form, a current sensor 18 whose output signal modulates the out put pulse width of a signal generator 15 . The output from the signal generator 15 is used to control the conduction times of semiconductor T via drive circuit 3 . Although it is possible, indeed desirable, to synchronise operation of the signal generators 15 of the different servo loops, the loops are completely independent of one another, and the instan taneous pulse width of the drive pulses in any one servo loop is controlled only by the characteristics of that loop.
