# APPARATUS FOR DETECTING THE GENERAL OUTLINE AND ABRUPT SURFACE VARIATIONS OF A FLACCID SHEET LIKE WORKPIECE FORMED FROM AT LEAST A PORTION OF A NATURAL TOBACCO LEAF

## Abstract
Such apparatus provides a representation of the general outlines and abrupt surface variations of a to bacco leaf L supported on a support surface wich re presentation is used for locating cut locations on the leaf from which wrappers W can be cut. The apparatus includes a foraminate, light ray conducting leaf receiv ing conveyor 300 on which the leaf is held in a spread condition by vacuum. A light source 360 on one side of the conveyor passes light through the conveyor and the leaf thereon such that the transmitted light intensity at the other side of the conveyor which is measured by a scanning head 340 comprising a series of units extend ing across the conveyor in an X direction is indicative of the shielding effect of the conveyor and leaf. The con veyor is shifted in a Y direction orthogonal to the X di rection past the units and digital signals indicative of the shielded light intensity at each of the units 340 at each shifted position, or further digital signals derived from these signals, are recorded in a memory and a repre sentation of the general outline and abrupt surface varia tions of the leaf is created in a computer.
