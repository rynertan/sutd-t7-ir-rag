# Method and apparatus for healing tissue.

## Abstract
An apparatus 10 and method for promoting healing of injured tissue, such as fractured bone, with interacting electric current and a magnetic flux field. Electrodes 16, 17 are adhesively attached to the skin adjacent the injured tissue. One or more coil assemblies 18, 19 normally spaced from the electrodes 16, 17 are located adjacent the tissue in alignment with the fractured bone. A probe generator 26 electrically connected to the electrodes 16, 17 operates to provide electric current pulses to the electrodes 16, 17 . A field generator 31 electrically connected to the coil assemb lies 18, 19 is operable to energize the coil assemblies 18, 19 to produce magnetic field pulses. The pulse generator 26 and field generator 31 are electrically coupled to maintain the electrode current pulses and magnetic field pulses in fixed phase relationship to produce a net current in the region of the fractured bone and generally perpendicular to the plane of the fracture.
