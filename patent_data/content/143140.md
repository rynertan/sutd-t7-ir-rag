## Description
Pedal crank central motion device for bicyclesThe present invention relates to an improved pedal central motion device with crown gear transmission for bicycles.The invention is particularly suitable for improving the efficien cy of the transmission of the pedal crank central motioii unlit and relative crown gear of bicycles. Iii the present state of the art a trajismissioii system to the central pin utilizes a single transmission arm called pedal crank which keys directly, by bearing means, to the central shaft connected with the crown gear for engaging the chain which traiismits motion to the back free wheel.The main drawback resulting from this transmission system is the considerable stiffiiess of the lijikage which does not allow recovery aiid reversal of pickup forces and coiisequejitly involves a necessary oversizing of the central trallsmission shaft and coiniected pedal craiik. A further drawback results from the substantial ullidirectiollal friction force trajismi tted to the ceiitral trajismissiojj shaft at the maximum pickup moment, that is when the pedal crank is horizontally forward oriented.The square hole pedal crank keyiiig systems to the relative central colulectillg shaft ill bicycles are well known, which are provided with square clutching key to the respective opposite eiids in which, especially ill racitig bicycles subjected to considerable stress, the pedal crank keyiiig strips due to the excessive beiidiiig stress thereoii which ijivolves a deflection torsion reaction on the keyiiig resulting ill said strippiiig.Attempts to avoid this disadvantage have beeii unsuccessfull, because the metal characteristics of the pedal crank or the respective section should be improved with collsequellt weight increase and therefore total efficiency decrease of the bicycle, which must be, as it is well known, as light as possible.In fact, pedal cranks used at presellt are made of ultralight alloy and for ijicreasijig the material streiigth, alloy steel as for the connecting shaft should be used which is much heavier aiid thus llot convenient ill the same way, a thickening of the keying kiiot would be unsuccessfull, becomillg excessively projectijig alld increasing ally way the bicycle weight.The invelltion as claimed is intended to remedy these drawbacks improving the transmission efficiellcy. It solves the problem by carrying out a plurality of levers keyed coaxially on the central transmission axis together with the pedal crank, one intercon acted with the other for receivillg alld retransmitting the torque applied to the pedal craiik to the filial transmission lever llormally placed at the opposite side of the pedal craiik and keyed, on the ceiitral transmission axis, to the end of said ceiitral trasmissioji shaft by meals of a free rotatable connecting bush placed ijiside the eiid of said pedal crank. An important feature of the central device, comprises the keying of the crown gear oti said axially displaceable connecting bush.The advatitages offered by the itivetitioti are maitily that a transmission of considerable elastic effect is determined which call absorbe the greater forces applied iii the transmission optimum condition horizontal pedal crank forward oriented and gradually atid progressively trallsmits them ill the immediately successive momellts, with the further advatitage of absorbing most of the frictions which otherwise would develop for the strong initial action of unidirectional forces oti the respective support of the central transmission shaft.Further, the axially displaceable crowti gear allows the selfaligning with the opposed free wheel by mealls of the respective connecting chain.The itwetitioti is described in detail below, by way of example ollly, with referellce to drawillgs which illustrate some preferred embodiments, in which Figure 1 is a schema tic frotit elevatioll view, on the normal plane to the axis of the cetitral trallsmissioll shaft, of the pedal crank unlit carried out ill accordance with the improvemetit of the presetit invention, in the specific case with the pedal crank horizontally forward oriented for receivitig the maximum motion transmission stress Figure 2 is a tratisversal sectiotial top view on the planeX X of the pedal cratik unlit showit in Figure 1 Figure 3 is a tiormal view with respect to the central rotatioll axis taketi from the side of the crowti gear of the cetitral motion device with relative pedal cranks, without visualization of the bicycle frame support Figure 4 is ati axial partial sectional view on the plane X X of the cetitral motioti device ill Figure 3 not mounted oti the bicycle frame.Figures 1 atid 2 show the pedal crank unlit comprising a proper pedal cratik 1 provided with a threaded free fetid hole 1 for screwing the pedal atid with a free hole passing at the opposite side 1 through the cetitral pin trallsmissioll axis 0 0, beitig the pedal cratik of a conventional statidard free length L1 attd free to rotate ill lleutral transmission with respect to said celltral transmission pill passillg through the respective RTI ID 4.23 central unlit axis 0 0 a first transmission arm 2 pivoted ill all illtermediate point 2 of the free length L1 of the pedal crank 1 a first transmission lever arm 3, of a free length L2 shorter than the free length L1 of the pedal crank arm, also rotatively free, pivoted on said axis 0 0 of the cetttral motion transmission pill atid pivoted at the free fetid with the respective free fetid of said first trallsmissioll arm 2 of the pedal cratik 1 a secoiid transmission arm 4 pivoted ill all ititermediate poitit of the free length L2 of said first transmission lever arm 3 a second transmission lever arm 5, of a free length L3 shorter thati the length L2 of said first transmission lever arm 3, also rotatively free, pivoted on said axis 0 0 of the central motion transmission pill attd pivoted at the free fetid with the respective free fetid of the second transmission arm 4 of said first trallsmis sion lever arm 3 a third trallsmissioll arm 6 elastically fixed ill all itttermediate poitit of the free length L3 of said second transmission lever arm 5, which extetids by meatus of all itttermediate arm 7 and connects at the free end of a third transmission lever arm 8 of a length L4 larger thati the length L3 of said second trallsmissioll lever arm 5 atid pivots ott the cetitral axis 0 0 to the respective central motioti transmission pitt by means of a keying system 8 which supports coaxially atid rotatively free said first transmission lever arm 3 attd second transmission lever arm 5 atid said pedal crank 1.More ill detail, the third transmission arm 6 together with the respective ititermediate arm 7 connect ill a triangular way at the free ettd of the third transmission lever arm 8, which is placed exactly at the opposite side of the pedal cratik 1.In accordance with the invention, the pedal crank 1, being rotatively free, trallsmits the torque FixL1 rotatitig ott the axis 0 0 to said first trallsmissioll lever arm 3 which practically retratismits friction excluded the same torque F2xL2 to said second transmission lever arm 5, which ill its turin practically retransmits imputable frictioti excluded the same torque F3xL3 to said third transmission lever arm 8 but more elastically by means of the triangulation 6,7 , which ill its turti practically retran smits imputable frictiott excluded the same torque F4xL4 to the cetttral transmission axis by means of the respective keying key 8 , but with a force F4 from the bottom upward atid opposed to the original force F1, usually smaller atid farther, the result being a lightening of the frictioti stresses which are redistributed ill a more or less uttiform way aroutid the cetitral axis 0 0, whilst the origitial force F1 is litterally elastically absorbed by the above described articulatioti in a spiral way at the pickup for being theft immediately returlled. With such a system the cotisiderable advatitage is therefore obtaitted of better transmitting the torque FixL1 through the intermediation of a set of neutral levers 1,3,5 before passing to the proper keyitig lever for the definitive transmission of the traction torque of the vehicle 8, which lever will theti be orietited from the bottom upwards F4 instead of down from above Fl as it is tiormal ill the conventional transmission system with single pedal cratik 1.In one preferred embodiment of the invention the central device comprises two equal attd opposite pedal cranks A,B, as previously described, one havitig a lengthenable connecting bush protruditig aroutid a cetitral shaft C and comprising a peripheral toothed keying itt order to key, free axially movable, a conventional crow gear D.The cetitral transmission axis C is a conventional central transmission axis with shaped keying etids further axially comprisitig a threaded hole for clampitig by a screw 9 the connec titig bush 8 of the pedal cranks A,B. Obviously, the cetitral shaftC is mounted ott the support frame of the bicycle, by means of bearitigs E. Collvellietltly the crown gear D includes a setscrew 11, to stop, for special purposes, its free axial movement. One of said pedal cranks is provided with an elastically lengtheliable spring 10 oriettted to abut agaitist the periphery of said crown gear to avoid the diseitgaged transmission chaill being inserted betweeti the crowti gear atid the respective pedal crank.
