# DIGITAL FLUOROSCOPY APPARATUS

## Abstract
In a digital fluoroscopy apparatus 100 , digital refer ence data is written in a given data position of digital image data where no medical information is contained. This digital reference data has contrast level information with respect to X ray images of an object 1 under examination. The image data having the reference data is stored in an ana logue storage device 22 after being D A converted. When the image signal having the D A converted reference data is again A D converted for the digital subtraction, the con trast level of the finally A D converted reference data va ries from that of the original reference data. The image data having the finally A D converted reference data is correct ed based upon the contrast level variation from the original level in an image data correction unit 29 .
