# Activating plasticizer for urethane prepolymers and complex of alkali metal salt with 4,4 methylenedianiline.

## Abstract
Storable polypropylene ether polyurethane composition tions composed of a a prepolymer of a polypropylene ether glycol and sufficient organic polyisocyanate to give prefer ably an excess of about 3 to 15 percent NCO in said prepolymer with the proviso that the free NCO is obtained from methylene di p phenyl diisocyanate and b a complex of an alkali metal salt with 4,4 methylenedianiline MDA , said composition being relatively inactive at temperatures below 100 C, but being heat activatible at much higher temperatures to effect a cure. The improved composition wherein a catalyst is present in said composition which effectively lowers the cure temperature, said catalyst being a pseudocrown ether containing radicals having the formula y CH₂ CH₂ with y being nitrogen, sulfur or oxygen and n has values sufficient to form the crown structure, viz at least 3 or more.
