# Heat exchanger for integrated circuit packages.

## Abstract
The present disclosure describes a heat exchange device for attachment to the external surface of a package containing an integrated circuit chip or die. The device has particular application in high density electronic packaging configuration, where space limitations severaly curtail the volume which can be occupied thereby. The structure of the present device is such that both the effective cooling area per given volume and the heat transfer coefficient are maximized. Basically, the device is an integral structure comprised of a generally helical wire form affixed to a metallic frame like member. The wire form provides a plurality of parallel closely spaced apart cylindrical sections capable of being disposed in an air stream for dissipating the heat generated in the integrated circuit package to which the device is attached.
