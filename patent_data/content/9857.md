# FLY ASH AGGLOMERATOR, FLUE EQUIPPED WITH THIS AGGLOMERATOR AND PROCESS FOR REMOVING SUSPENDED CHARGED PARTICLES OF MIXED SIZE FROM A VOLUME OF GAS

## Abstract
A fly ash agglomerator for improving the efficiency of the electrostatic precipitators. Contaminated gas is passed through a charger wherein suspended particles become elec trically charged, and thence past a plurality of parallel plates aligned with the flow direction. An AC voltage source applied to the plates subjects the charged particles to a high voltage AC field, which causes the larger sized particles to sweep past the smaller sized particles. The smaller particles adhere to the larger particles, thereby increasing the mean particle size. The gas stream is then passed through a collector to remove the particles from the gas stream.
