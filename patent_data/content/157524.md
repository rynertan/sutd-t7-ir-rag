# FLAT PANEL DISPLAY

## Abstract
A flat panel display 1 comprising a panel 3 including intersecting row and column electrodes 11, 13 and using selected unipolar isogonal waveform signals to address each set of row electrodes 11 and each set of column electrodes. This allows display of simple geometric structures reference lines, grids, cross wire features and reference symbols such as boxes and line markers, structures all requiring representation by two or more picture elements in some of the colums 13 . The panel matrix may be of cartesian or polar format. As exam ple, a cross wire feature display 1 is shown and described. Two isogonal signals. a squarewave and its inverse, are gener ated using two shift and store bus registers 7 9 . Signal and electrode selection is controlled in response to input co ordi nate address data, using a comparator 27 29 and an exclu sive OR gate 15 17 to control the data input D of each regis ter 7 9 . The flat panel display 1 may be used as a graticule in an optical sight or image projection system. Alternatively it may be used as an overlay to printed, back projected, and other stat ic images and pictures. it may be used as an accessory to a cathode ray tube or to another flat panel electronic display. Also, it may take the form of a quasi analogue meter display with an additional hand used to denote or record some particu lar value or values of the variable displayed by the main hand.
