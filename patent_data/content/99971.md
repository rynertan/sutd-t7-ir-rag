# Retro stroke compression and image generation of script and graphic data employing an information processing system.

## Abstract
A method for compactly storing and reproducing script and graphic data from a computer input device. The com puter input device sends a time sequence stream of x, y coordinates indicating graphic character locations on the input device. The first coordinate point of the graphic data is stored. Subsequent points are buffered until a reversal in the coordinate magnitude direction is detected with regard to either coordinate axis. This point is taken as a sample point and terminates a buffered segment and starts a new buffered segment Each segment of the graphic character is approximated by a circular arc segment which is retained by storing the horizontal displacement to the mid point of the arc segment along with the x and y displacements to the ending point of the segment. The retained information is sufficient to reproduce the input script or graphic for display, print, or manipulation. This is accomplished by mathemati cally regenerating the arc segments in the same sequence as they were originally created.
