# Disk storage file with a four phase, single phase drive stepping motor.

## Abstract
A storage file for particular use with a flexible magnetic disk having a series of concentric magnetic tracks thereon, comprising a four phase stepping motor for moving a trans ducer head radially of the magnetic disk. The stepping motor has several sets of first, second, third and fourth phase windings arranged sequentially in the order named. A radial drive control circuit is provided which normally acts to cause energization of the stepping motor windings in a single phase drive mode to cause rotation of the rotor by discrete increments. In order to prevent the rotor from being trapped in alignment with the third phase windings, instead of being returned to the first phase windings, when the disk file is electrically turned on, the radial drive control circuit further functions to briefly energize a selected one or more of the second, third and fourth phase windings of each set, with the simultaneous or subsequent energization of the first phase windings. This makes it possible to positively return the transducer head to the outermost track zero position on the magnetic disk, for the commencement of proper data transfer therebetween, despite the unavoidable sensing errors of an optical track zero sensor commonly built into the device.
