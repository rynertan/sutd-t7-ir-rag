# Disc brake.

## Abstract
A disc brake includes a torque plate 14 which sup ports a caliper 20 via at least one pin assembly 24 . The pin assembly comprises a first part 48 and a second part 50 . The second part defines a first friction surface 55 with the first part and a second friction surface 57 with the caliper. The first friction surface generates less friction than the second friction surface to assist a rotor 12 in knocking back a pair of friction elements 42 and 44 , thereby substantially eliminating drag between the rotor and the pair of friction elements.
