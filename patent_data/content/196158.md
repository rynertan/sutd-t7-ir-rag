# Apparatus and methods for resistivity testing.

## Abstract
An automatic sheet resistance mapping system for semi conductor wafers which has the capability of taking high ac curacy, multiple test readings in both contour scan and diam eter scan modes. A rotatable wafer stage 120 carries a semi conductor wafer 80 thereon with the center of the wafer posi tioned substantially at the axis of rotation of the wafer stage. A probe head assembly 110 , including a linear array of at least four equally spaced probe tips 114 projecting from one sur face of the assembly is mounted facing the wafer stage on an arrangement for moving the probe tips alternately into and out of contact with the surface of a wafer carried thereon. Position ing arrangements 121 are provided for rotating the wafer stage to accurately registered angular test positions and for producing translation between the wafer stage and the probe head assembly to position the array of probe tips at accurately registered radial test positions relative to the center of the wafer. The positioning arrangements are operable in a diameter scan mode to locate the probe tips at a multiplicity of succes sive, closely spaced test positions along a diameter line of the wafer and are operative in a contour scan mode to locate the probe tips at a two dimensional array of different positions across the area of the wafer. The mounting arrangement for the probe head positions the probe head in a prearranged alignment position with the linear array of probe tips oriented at a pre arranged small acute angle to a radius line so that the test probe tips each define a track of separated test probe footprints on the wafer in the diameter scan mode.
