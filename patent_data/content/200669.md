# ADJUSTABLE PRESSURE REGULATING SOLENOID VALVE

## Abstract
A pressure regulating solenoid valve is disclosed which comprises a valve body 29 having a flow path F there through having an inlet 31 and an outlet 33 . The valve body 29 has a main valve seat 37 within the flow path F , and a main valve member 35 mounted within the valve body 29 for movement between an open position, in which the main valve member 35 is clear of the main valve seat 37 for the primary flow of fluid between the inlet 31 and outlet 33 , and a closed position in which the main valve member 35 engages the main valve seat 37 so as to block the primary flow of fluid through the main valve seat 37 . A spring biased combination throttling valve check valve 91 is interposed within the flow path between the upstream and downstream sides of the main valve seat 37 so as to permit a secondary flow of fluid from the inlet 31 to the outlet 33 of the valve body 29 when the main valve 35 is closed and when the pressure differential of the flow between the inlet 31 and the outlet 33 is above a predetermined value.
