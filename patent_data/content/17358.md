# Electrical connector housing with a mounting peg.

## Abstract
An electrical connector housing for mounting on a substrate within a relatively wide range of thicknesses, has at least one boss 4 for receipt in an associated hole 103 within a relatively wide range of diameters, in the substrate 100 , thereby mechanically to secure the housing 1 to the substrate 100 , the boss 4 comprising a semi cylindrical portion 5 extending axially from a surface of the housing 1 and a laterally extending fin portion 6 formed integrally with the semi cylindrical portion 5 and having a first surface 7 contiguous with the curved surface 8 of the semi cylindrical portion 5 , and a second surface 9 extending from the planar surface 10 of the semi cylindrical portion 5 , the first and second surfaces 7 and 9 meeting to define an outer edge 11 for the fin portion 6 .
