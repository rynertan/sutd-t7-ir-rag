# METHOD FOR MANUFACTURING PHENOLIC RESIN FOAM

## Abstract
A method for manufacturing a phenolic resin foam is provided which comprises the steps of mixing a composition consisting of 100 parts by weight of a resol type phenol formaldehyde resin, 5 to 40 parts by weight of a curing agent consisting of an acid, and a foaming agent consisting of an isocyanate or a mixture thereof with water, and heating the composition for foaming, an amount of the isocyanate being 5 to 30 parts by weight if the foaming agent is the isocyanate alone, and the amount of the isocyanate being not less than its equivalent weight and an amount of water being 5 to 30 parts by weight if the foaming agent is the mixture of the isocyanate with water. If 100 parts by weight of a urethane modified phenol formaldehyde resin are used in place of 100 parts by weight of the resol type phenol formaldehyde resin, 0.1 to 1.5 parts by weight of a curing agent consisting of a tin compound are used in place of the acid curing agent. The method of the invention allows easy control of the formation of cells and improves the yield of foamed product.
