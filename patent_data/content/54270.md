# Starter and discharge lamp starting circuit.

## Abstract
A glow bottle starter having three lead in wires and containing two bimetals connected together at one end and a rigid tungsten rod. The bimetals make closed contact with the tungsten rod in the quiescent state of the starter, and upon electrical current flow through one or both of the bimetals to cause elevation to a predetermined temperature. In a circuit including the glow bottle starter, one of the bimetals and the rigid tungsten rod are connected across the output of a ballast circuit, and the tungsten rod and other bimetal are connected across the lamp. Upon initial energiza tion of the ballast, short circuit current through the bimetal is operative to separate the bimetals from the tungsten rod to provide an open starter circuit and a switching transient across the lamp upon starting of the lamp, the resulting current flow through both bimetals maintains the bimetals separated from the rod.
