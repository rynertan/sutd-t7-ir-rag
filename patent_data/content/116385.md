# Method of manufacturing a rotary anode for X ray tubes and anode thus produced.

## Abstract
A layer 2 of W or of a W alloy is provided on a forged supporting member 1 of an X ray rotary anode by plasma spraying. By carrying out the plasma spraying at reduced pressure, a layer 2 is obtained which is suitable as a target layer for X ray rotary anodes.
