# MASS DATA RECORDER WITH DUAL MEMORY SYSTEM

## Abstract
A mass data acquisition system utilizes a recorder that is provided with both CMOS RAM 18 and a removable memory cartridge 28 . The memory cartridge can be used to transport data from the recorder to a translator 32 . Furthermore, the CMOS RAM is used to store the data records formulated during an entire recording period. When operated in the RAM mode 28 out , all data is stored in the CMOS RAM and the data cartridge is used only for purposes of transporting data to the translator. When operated in the cartridge mode 28 inserted , all formulated data is stored in both the CMOS RAM and the cartridge. This cartridge mode of operation provides redundancy and serves as a backup dual memory system to prevent loss of data in the event that a memory malfunction occurs in either one of the two memory media. The recorder can also communicate with a translator 32 over phone lines 38 in conjunction with serial I O 34 and a MODEM 36 . When communicating with a translator on the phone line, data can be obtained from either a cartridge, when in the cartridge mode, or directly from CMOS RAM when in the RAM mode.
