# Chromium containing catalyst, process for its preparation with sulfur treatment and use thereof in olefin polymerization.

## Abstract
High melt flow olefin polymers suitable for such applications as injection molding, and the like requiring a narrow molecular weight distribution are produced using a catalyst made by treating a chromium catalyst on a silica containing base with a sulfur containing material, and thereafter reoxidizing.
