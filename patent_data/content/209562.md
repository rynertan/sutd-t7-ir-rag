## Description
The present invention relates to interpolating analogue to digital converters for effecting analogue to digital conversion. Known interpolating analogue to digital converters usually comprise a relatively coarse resolution analogue to digital A D converter arranged in a feedback loop in combination with a digital to analogue D A converter the D A converter having much finer resolution than the coarse A D converter. The coarse A D converter, typically 6 bits resolution, is sampled at a high sample rate, typically 10MHz, with subsequent averaging of the output samples obtained from the coarse resolution A D converter. The quantised signal appearing at the output of the coarse A D converter is an approximation of the analogue signal fed to it, the approximation being dependent upon the quantum jump or step size of the quantisation and the sample rate used in the quantisation process. At any point in time, the difference between the analogue input signal and the output sample from the coarse A D converter is known as the quantisation error generally termed Q. The output from the coarse A D converter is fed to the finer resolution D A converter, the output of which is fed back and combined with the incoming analogue input signal to be digitised. However the D A converter utilised also gives rise to errors. The principle of operation of interpolating analog to digital converters is described in J.C. Candy A Use of Limit Cycle Oscillations to obtain Robust Analog to Digital Converters , IEEE Transations on Communications, Vol. COM 22, No. 8, March 1974, pp 298 to 305, in which the converter operates in an oscillatory mode to produce a repetitive serial pulse stream, which stream is a digitally coded version of the analog input signal. The pulse stream is fed to a digital low pass or decimating filter to provide a high resolution PCM output. Another analysis of analog to digital converters employing high sampling rates is given in H.A. Spang and P.M. Schultheiss Reduction of Quantizing Noise by Use of Feedback , IRE Transactions on Communication Systems, December 1962, pp. 373 to 380 in which the quantisation error from the quantiser is fed back via a delay line system to the input of the converter. Such systems are known as Σ Δ feedback converters. A further development of interpolating analog to digital converters is shown in M. Dietrich Zur Verbesserung des Signal Rausch Verhaltnisses von Interpolativen Analog Digital Umsetzern NTG Fachberichte, In D. Seitzer, G. Pretzl, N.A. Hamdy Electronic Analog to Digital Converters John Wiley and Sons, 1983, there is described on pp 65 to 77 a voltage to frequency converter employing a similar principle of operation to the analog to digital converters described above, and wherein a capacitor is successively charged and discharged by reference currents. It is an object of the present invention to provide an interpolating analog to digital converter operating on the principle of limit cycle oscillations, but which has improved simplicity of construction and accuracy of operation compared to the prior art referred to above. The present invention provides an interpolating analogue to digital converter, comprising In accordance with the invention, the first and second signal combines may simply comprise operational amplifiers, for example the type LF 157 described in National Semiconductor Corp., Linear Databook , 1982, pages 3 7 to 3 34. Such amplifiers have a relatively high slew rate. In accordance with the invention it is not necessary to employ special purpose integrator circuits, in contrast to the prior art referred to above. In accordance with the invention, the one step digital quantiser preferably comprises a D type flip flop, for example that described in Motorola Data Book MC54 74 HC 74 pp 5 57 to 5 60. An embodiment of the invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Referring now to Figures 1 and 2 there is shown an interpolating A D converter 20 in accordance with the present invention. In Figures 1 and 2 like reference numerals have been used to indicate like parts of the A D converter 20. The A D converter 20 comprises combiner means in the form of a combiner 22, such as an operational amplifier as shown in Figure 2, for receiving an analogue signal V It can be seen from Figure 2 that the feedback loop 30 includes trimmer means such as a potentiometer 32 for trimming the signal fed along the feedback loop 30 to the combiner 22. The output of the converter 24, is also connected to digital filter means, such as a digital filter 34 having a bandwidth F In operation, an analogue signal to be digitised, V The expected quantisation error Q of the converter 24 can be identified by subtracting the input signal to the converter 24 from its output signal. In the A D converter 20 shown in Figures 1 and 2 this is achieved by affording the analogue input signal to the converter 24 also to the combiner 26 along the feed forward loop 28. The combiner 26 also receives the digital output signal Do from the converter 24 and hence, the quantisation error Q will appear at the output of the combiner 26. The quantisation error Q is fed along the feedback loop 30 to the combiner 22 where it is combined subtractively from the analogue input signal. The analogue input signal minus the quantisation error Q is then presented to the input of the converter 24 and the process is repeated each time the converter 24 is clocked by the clock pulses Fs. The digital output Do from the converter 24 and the analogue input signal can be combined in this manner because the digital output signal from the converter 24, being a one step or one bit converter, is effectively an analogue voltage. For example, if the converter 24 is capable of providing an output signal having a voltage level of either 0V or 5V, representing, for example logical one and logical zero respectively, it can be seen that such voltage levels may be combined readily with the analogue input signal. The A D converter 20 operates in a limit cycle mode of operation to provide a serial output pulse stream D The performance of the one bit converter 24 shown in Figures 1 and 2 can be expressed in general terms as Thus it can be seen that the output of the converter 24, D It can be shown mathematically that, using the arrangement shown in Figure 3 with a digital filter having a bandwidth Fb of 10KHz and a clock having a clock rate Fs of 10MHz, 16 bits resolution can be achieved using, for example, LF157 operational amplifiers as sold by National Semiconductors which is superior to the resolution of known interpolating A D converters. However, greater resolution can be obtained by using discrete amplifiers with a greater unity gain bandwidth and slew rate. Furthermore, the A D converter of the present invention does not suffer from the problems with stability described previously with respect to known converters as the total loop gain of the converter is zero. In the embodiment shown in Figure 2 the potentiometer 32 is included in the feedback loop 30 so that the signal received by the combiner 22 via the feedback loop 30 is dependent upon the quantisation error of the one bit converter 24. However, the potentiometer 32 may be omitted. The A D converter according to the present invention may be fabricated as an integrated circuit, using CMOS technology and such an integrated circuit may or may not include the clock means and the digital filter means.
