# Universal multi station document inserter.

## Abstract
A universal multi station document inserter has a plural ity of feeder stations for feeding documents in response to signals from a central processor. Each feeder station has a unique address. Feeder programs are stored in distributed processors associated with the feeder stations which provide instructions to each feeder station for feeding documents. A supervisory program is stored in a central processor which is capable of providing address and command signals to the distributed processors of the feeder stations. The central processor and the distributed processors are interconnected for the transmission of signals so that upon receipt of the proper address and command signals at the feeder stations, the feeder stations will provide certain document feeding functions under control of the central processor in accord ance with instructions programmed into the distributed processors associated therewith.
