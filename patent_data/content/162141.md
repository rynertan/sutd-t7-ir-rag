## Description
Steering column for motor vehicles, with a flexible slip coupling resistant to bending momentsThe present invention relates to a steering column for motor vehicles, of the type comprising a shaft carrying a steering wheel and supported at at least one point on a support fixed to the body of the vehicle, a universal joint connecting the steering column to a steering member of a steering box, a flexible coupling located between the universal joint and the steering wheel, and constituted by an elastically deformable disc and two drive members connected to respective faces of the disc, one of the drive members being fixed to a first shaft element connected rigidly to a fork of the universal joint and the other drive member being rigid with a second shaft element connected to the steering wheel.Steering columns of this type often also include an intermediate shaft between the universal joint and the shaft carrying the steering wheel, the intermediate shaft being connected to the steering wheel shaft by a second universal joint. In such cases, the flexible coupling may be incorporated in the intermediate shaft, whereby the first and second shaft elements constitute parts of this shaft.On modern motor vehicles frequent use is made of a flexible coupling mounted on the steering column, between the steering wheel and steering box, in order to isolate the steering wheel and the entire vehicle body from the vibrations transmitted from the engine and from the wheels jolted by any unevenness of the road surface. These couplings should be flexible so as to achieve their isolating function, and be sufficiently rigid torsionally to transmit the torque from the steering wheel to the steering box without excessive elastic yielding. Generally, they are of the type made from a rubber disc reinforced torsionally by appropriate rubber inserts, and two drive forks mounted on the opposite faces of the disc.The steering column is normally constituted by two portions of shaft inclined to each other and to the shaft of the pinion, worm or other steering member of the steering box, these portions being connected to each other and to the pinion shaft by means of universal joints or the like.In these conditions, there are considerable moments acting on the forks of the universal joints in the plane of the forks and the shafts, which tend to alter the relative inclination of the shafts. These moments, which will be termed conic moments in the following, increase with the inclination of the shafts.If there are no flexible couplings other than the universal joints, these conic moments are absorbed by the shafts as bending moments without causing any problem. If a flexible coupling of the type described above is mounted on any of the shafts, however, the conic moments are discharged onto the rubber disc and deform it, preventing the steering column from functioning ,correctly. There are other types of flexible couplings without discs, which have characteristics such as to withstand these conic moments without excessive conic yielding, but they cannot attain the axial flexibility of a disc type coupling.The object of the present invention is to provide a steering column of the aforesaid type with a disc type flexible coupling which is flexible axially like a normal coupling of this type and can withstand conic moments without yielding.According to the present invention, this object is achieved by a steering column of the aforesaid type, characterised in that the first shaft is supported slidably and rotatably by the second shaft element at at least one point outside the plane of the deformable disc, so as to keep the shaft elements coaxial with each other in all operating conditions and permit relative rotation and axial displacement between them.A further important characteristic of the invention is that it provides for the realisation of a coupling in which the drive members can slide axially relative to one another if necessary, with the advantages that will come to light in the following.Several preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the appended drawings, in which Figure 1 shows a prior art steering column in two portions with a rack type steering box and no flexible coupling Figure 2 shows a steering column with a flexible coupling according to the invention Figure 3 is an axial view of a coupling according to the invention Figure 4 is a longitudinal sectional view of the coupling along the line X X of Figure 3 Figure 5 is a sectional view similar to Figure 4 of part of a steering column according to another embodiment of the invention Figure 6 is a view similar to Figure 5 of a further embodiment of the invention, andFigure 7 is an axial view of the coupling of Figure 6.Figure 1 shows a two part steering column which connects a steering wheel 1 to the pinion 8 of a steering box 9, for example of the rack type. The shaft 2 carrying the steering wheel 1 is supported by two bushes or roller bearings 4 carried by a support 3 fixed to the body of the vehicle in a known manner, not illustrated. At the lower end of the shaft 2 is fixed a fork of a universal joint 5 the other fork of which is carried at one end of an intermediate shaft 6. The opposite end of the intermediate shaft carries one fork of a second universal joint 7 the second fork of which is connected to the shaft of the pinion 8 of the steering box 9.The functioning of this steering column is evident and is not described here.The forks of the universal joints 5 and 7 are acted upon by conic moments M5 and M71 shown in the plane of the drawing for simplicity, which are variable upon rotation of the column and subject the shafts 2, 6, 8 to bending moments.Figure 2 shows a similar steering column to Figure 1, with a disc type flexible coupling 10 incorporated in U S U fl q a the intermediate shaft 6. The parts common to Figures 1 and 2 are indicated by the same reference numerals.In Figure 2, one of the bushes or bearings 4 is replaced by a bearing 11 which anchors the shaft 2 axially. While, in the steering column of Figure 1, the pinion 3 secures the shaft 2 and steering wheel 1 axially by means of the universal joints 5, 7 and the shaft 6, the shaft 2 of the steering column of Figure 2 could move axially, due to the presence of the flexible coupling 10, if it were not anchored with the bearing 11. The coupling 10 of Figure 2 should be able to withstand the conic moments M5 and M7.Figures 3 and 4 show how the flexible coupling according to the invention, for example the coupling 10 of Figure 2, is made in such a way that it can resist the conic moments M5 and M7. The intermediate shaft 6 is constituted by a tubular shaft 13 to one end of which is fixed a fork 12 of a universal joint, for example the universal joint 5 of Figure 2. At its opposite end, the shaft 13 carries one drive member 14 of the flexible coupling. A shaft 18 bears the second drive member 17 of the flexible coupling and the fork 19 of the second universal joint, for example the joint 7 of Figure 2, and is supported at points 20, 21 by the tubular shaft element 13. An elastic disc 15 is mounted between the drive members 14 and 17 by means of bolts 16. With this arrangement, the two shafts 13 and 18 are free to move axially relative to one another following deformation of the disc, and are connected torsionally by the latter.It is also possible to eliminate the support between the two shafts 13, 18 vicinity of the elastic disc, that is, at the zone 21, since the disc is capable of centering the shafts relative to one another in this zone.Figure 5 shows a flexible coupling similar to that ofFigure 4, in which the disc 15 is connected to the drive members 14, 17 by pins 22 instead of the bolts 16 shown in Figure 4. The pins 22 are captive in the two metal members 14, 17 and are provided with stop rings 23, which have the sole purpose of preventing any accidental disconnection of the coupling.Clearly with this embodiment, it is possible for the shaft 13 to slide relative to the shaft 18 within the limits allowed by the stop rings 23, fulfilling the function of the coupling.This characteristic may be important for two reasons.First of all, there is the safety aspect. In fact, with a coupling of this type, the backward movement of the steering wheel in the event of a head on collision of the vehicle is reduced, since the steering box can move a certain distance towards the interior without moving the steering wheel. Secondly, it permits the installation of the steering wheel column steering box assembly to be simplified in that no adjustment of the distance between the steering box and the fixing of the steering column support is required, which may also be useful in the automation of the production line installation of the assembly.The sliding characteristic is certainly obtainable by other means, for example by a splined coupling between the shafts 13 and 18, but this would involve an appreciable increase in cost, above all because considerable precision would be necessary in the machining of the teeth to minimise any play in the coupling. Play of the order of one tenth of a millimetre between the teeth would, in fact, cause totally unacceptable play on the steering wheel, given the small initial diameter of the toothing.A coupling of the type proposed, however, has the following advantages a the distance between the axes of the pins is certainly greater than the initial diameter of any toothing b any play can be completely eliminated by creating a slight interference between the pins and the holes in the rubber disc or leaving a small difference in the distances between the axes of the pins and the holes, so as to create a force fit between the pins and the elastic disc. The latter solution may be convenient to prevent any friction between the rubber and pins from making sliding difficult metal or plastics bushes may be inserted in the holes of the disc to prevent rubber metal contact.A device such as that proposed may also be used to absorb energy in the event of a head on collision. In fact, with appropriate shaping of the members of the coupling, it is possible, after a certain relative displacement between the two shafts 13, 18, for the drive members to strike one another and become deformed, thus absorbing energy. The amount of energy can be adjusted by varying the strength of the two drive members. Figures 6 and 7 illustrate an embodiment of this type, which, among other things, constitutes a further simplification of the device.The drive member 24 of the flexible coupling is connected directly to the fork 12 of a universal joint and therefore constitutes the tubular shaft 13 ofFigures 4 and 5. The shaft 18 is centered by the elastic disc 75 and by a sliding seat 27 formed in the same fork 12 The shape of the drive member 24 is such that, after a certain relative sliding movement of the two shafts dependent on the length of the pins, it comes into contact with the drive members 25 rigid with the second shaft 18. From this point on, the two shafts can again slide relative to each other, deforming only the two drive members and thus absorbing energy Clearly, the same result may be obtained by positioning the drive member 24 on a hollow shaft, as showy in the previous drawings. While the device is illustrated and described in relation to several preferred embodiments, it will be evident to those versed in the art that several variants in the form and detail thereof may be made, without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
