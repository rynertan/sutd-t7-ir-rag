## Description
The present invention relates to a method of manufacturing a bipolar semiconductor device, comprising the steps of selectively forming a buried layer of a second conductivity type in a surface region of a semiconductor substrate of a first conductivity type opposite to said second conductivity type forming at least one insulating film on said semiconductor substrate and forming at least one monocrystalline silicon layer of the second conductivity type on said buried layer in an opening of said insulating film, said monocrystalline silicon layer having a base region of the first conductivity type and an emitter region of the second conductivity type formed in said base region of the first conductivity type, and forming a conductive layer buried in said insulating film and connected to said base region of the first conductivity type. Such a method is known from EP A 0 102 075. Various conventional techniques have been proposed to improve the high speed, high frequency characteristics of a bipolar semiconductor device. Examples of these techniques include selective epitaxy and a combination of a super self aligned structure, wherein polycrystalline silicon is used as an electrode for connection with a base region, and trench isolation technique. The latter combination is described, e.g. in the following Gigabit Logic Bipolar Technology, Advanced Super Self Aligned Process Technology , Electronics Letters, Vol. 19, No. 18 1983 1.25 µm Deep Groove Isolated Self Aligned ECL Circuits , ISSCC82, IBM and S.K. Wiedmann, Status and Trends of I²L MTL Technology , IEDM Tech. Dig. pp. 47 50 1983 . Selective epitaxy is described, e.g. in H.J. Voss et al. Device Isolation Technology by Selective Low Pressure Silicon Epitaxy , IEDM Tech. Dig. pp. 35 38 1983 . N. Ohuchi et al. A New Self Aligned Transistor Structure for High Speed and Low Power Bipolar LSIs , IEDM Tech. Dig. pp. 55 58 1983 describes a technology using both techniques mentioned above. A bipolar transistor of a super self aligned structure has been proposed which uses polycrystalline silicon as an electrode for connection with the base. Such a bipolar transistor is described, e.g. in N. Sasaki et al. Bipolar Process Technology Evaluation by 3 Dimensional Device Simulation , IEDM Tech. Dig. pp. 546 549 1983 . In the high speed bipolar semiconductor devices described in the above texts, base resistance rbb influences the operation speed of the circuit most i.e. it has the largest sensitivity coefficient among device constants see Sotomura and Yamazaki, Development and Mass Production of Ultra High Speed ECL Logic HD100K Series , Hitachi Rompyo, pp. 59 62 1982 . Therefore, it is desirable to further reduce the base resistance rbb in order to improve the operation speed and high frequency characteristics of the bipolar transistor. When polycrystalline silicon is used as an electrode for connection with a base region, however, further micropatterning of presently available semiconductor devices is difficult since the sheet resistance of polycrystalline silicon is several tens to several hundreds of Ω . According to another conventional technique, a high melting metal or a silicide thereof such as MoSi₂, which has a low sheet resistance, is used in the super self aligned structure as an electrode for connection with the base in place of polycrystalline silicon, thereby decreasing base resistance rbb. However, these techniques are not practical because ohmic contact between such an alternative material and the base region is difficult to obtain. In addition, it is difficult to use these alternative materials as diffusion sources for the formation of external base regions. It is an object of the present invention to provide a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device having a small base resistance. According to the invention, the method initially defined is characterized in that the step of forming said monocrystalline silicon layer and said conductive layer comprises the steps of forming in a first step a semiconductor layer to be buried in said insulating film and containing an impurity of the first conductivity type, and forming a conductive layer connected thereto in order to decrease base connection resistance, the semiconductor layer lying on a side wall of said conductive layer subsequently forming a monocrystalline silicon layer to be buried in the insulating layer on said buried layer, said monocrystalline silicon layer being in contact with said semiconductor layer, and diffusing the impurity of the first conductivity type contained in said semiconductor layer into said monocrystalline silicon layer, thus forming at least a portion of said base region of the first conductivity type. This invention can be more fully understood from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which A method of manufacturing a semiconductor device according to an embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to Figs. 1 to 14. In Figs. 1 to 14, polycrystalline silicon portions are dotted to distinguish them from monocrystalline silicon portions. By the above mentioned steps, a semiconductor device is obtained which has p type semiconductor substrate 1 n In the bipolar transistor having the above structure, film 13 is provided between layer 19 and film 7 as a kind of buffer. Assume that most of the base region connection region electrode is constituted by pattern 7, which cannot easily maintain ohmic contact with layer 19. In this case, good ohmic contact can be obtained between graft base region 25 and film 7 because of the presence of film 13 therebetween. In addition, most of the base region connection region electrode is constituted by pattern 7, which has a small sheet resistance. Therefore, the resistance of the base connection region and hence the base resistance can be greatly reduced. High speed and high frequency characteristics of the bipolar semiconductor device are improved accordingly over conventional bipolar semiconductor devices. Layer 13 serves as a diffusion source for forming graft base region 25. In this manner, the structure is more effective than that which would be obtained by merely replacing the polycrystalline silicon base connection region with an MoSi₂ base connection region. The effect of reducing the base resistance will be described with reference to Fig. 14. Assume that emitter stripe length X is 4 µm, width W of film 7 is 8 µm, and distance L between pattern 13 and contact hole 41 for base electrode 45 is 4.5 µm. In Fig. 14, assume that the sheet resistances of region 33 and region 25 are 1 kΩ and 50 Ω , respectively, which are the same as those of a conventional bipolar semiconductor device. In the present device pattern 7 replaces the polycrystalline silicon layer between film 13 and contact hole 41 for base electrode 45. Note that sheet resistance p1 of film 13 is 100 Ω and sheet resistance p2 of pattern 7 is about 2 Ω . The decrease in base resistance rbb can thus be approximated as In practice, the entire base region is surrounded by pattern 7 so that base resistance rbb is further reduced. A bipolar transistor having this structure and one having the conventional structure i.e., one in which the base connection region is made of polycrystalline silicon were prepared, and the base resistances of both were compared. Base resistance rbb of the conventional device was 150 Ω whereas that of the present device was 80 Ω, about half that of the conventional device. Note that the shorter emitter stripe length X, the larger the L W ratio. Base resistance reduction is thus enhanced in this case. In the above embodiment, a washed emitter technique is used to form region 39 and electrode 43. In devices obtained using the washed emitter technique, the base and the emitter may short circuit. In order to prevent this, the semiconductor device may be manufactured in the following manner. Polycrystalline silicon film pattern 51, doped with an n type impurity, is formed after the formation of active base region 33. Protection film 53 is deposited on the entire surface of the resultant structure. An impurity is diffused from pattern 51 to form emitter region 39. After the formation of contact holes 55, 57, and 59, emitter, base, and collector electrodes 43, 45, and 47 are formed. The resultant semiconductor device is shown in Fig. 15. In the above embodiment, p type polycrystalline silicon layer 13 is formed to serve as a p type impurity diffusion source and allow ohmic contact between monocrystalline silicon and a high melting metal. However, the present invention is not limited to polycrystalline silicon. In the above embodiment, monocrystalline silicon constitutes the collector connection region. However, the present invention is not limited to this. High melting metals such as Mo, Ti and W or silicides thereof which are resistant to high temperature annealing at about 1,200 C can be used in place of monocrystalline silicon. Polycrystalline silicon can also be used. An n type impurity may be rediffused from buried layer 3 into monocrystalline silicon layer 19 during diffusion of an n type impurity into monocrystalline silicon layer 21, thereby reducing the emitter collector breakdown voltage. In order to prevent this, the collector connection region may be formed, e.g. by polycrystalline silicon, a high melting metal, or a silicide thereof. Opening 15 is formed for the formation of the transistor, and monocrystalline silicon layer 19 is then grown. With the above structure, a portion of the base connection region connection electrode is made of a material such as a high melting metal or a silicide thereof, both of which have good conductivity. Resistance of the base connection region and hence the base resistance is thus greatly decreased. Therefore, high speed, high frequency characteristics can be greatly improved over conventional bipolar semiconductor devices. In addition, the electrode for connection with the base can have substantial ohmic contact with the base region, and the base connection region can be used as a diffusion source for formation of the base. This benefit cannot be obtained by merely replacing a conventional base connection region with a high melting metal. The conductivity types of the respective portions of the semiconductor device according to the present invention are not limited to those employed in this embodiment. P and n type conductivity types can be exchanged to obtain the same effect. The present invention is not limited to a device having a single collector or a single emitter structure but can be applied to a device having a multi emitter or multi collector structure. The values indicated in the above embodiment are merely examples and should not be taken as fixed values.
