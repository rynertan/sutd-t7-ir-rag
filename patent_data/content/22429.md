# Process for the preparation of gastric acid neutralizing agents and gastric acid neutralizing agents.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to gastric acid neutralizing compositions comprising dried aluminum hydroxide in suspension form, whereby the composition as suspension stabilizing and suspension forming agent comprises a hydrogenated, hydrolyzed glucose polymer in an amount of 2 to 30 by weight. By way of this content of the glucose polymer the amount of gastric acid neutralizing substance can be increased whereby smaller doses can be administered in obtaining gastric acid neutralization.
