# Logic circuit with built in self test function.

## Abstract
A logic circuit according to this invention has a logic section 31 . First input terminals of first to third EX OR gates 75, 77, 79 are respectively connected to output terminals of preselected logic elements 45, 53, 63 among the logic elements which constitute the logic section 31 . Output terminals of the first and second EX OR gates 75, 77 are connected to second input terminals of the second and third EX OR gates 77, 79 . The functional test for this logic circuit is performed by inputting test pattern signals to the logic section 31 and by comparing output signals of the logic section 31 and an output signal S of the third EX OR gate 79 with the expected values.
