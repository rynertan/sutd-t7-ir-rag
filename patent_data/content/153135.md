## Description
HEAT CURABLE ONE PACKAGE POLYURETHANE RESIN COMPOSITION The present invention relates to heat curable polyurethane resin compositions comprising a polyurethane prepolymer having blocked isocyanate groups and a curing agent, to sealants made from such compositions in combination with one or more fillers, and to methods for using of such sealants. Polyurethanes have heretofore been used in the art for compounding sealants or adhesives for sealing seams or bonding different substrates. The polyurethanes used were either two package or one pot systems. In addiction to the need for sophisticated metering and mixing equipment for the two package systems, the isocyanate containing component must be kept and stored under anhydrous conditions to avoid the reaction of atmospheric moisture with the isocyanate groups, resulting in an unusable product. A one pot or one package polyurethane system having the advantage of easy handling is highly desirable in the sealant industry, and one pot moisture curable polyurethanes having terminal isocyanate groups have been taught in the art. On exposure to atmospheric moisture, some of the isocyanate groups react with water to form amino groups with the evolution of carbon dioxide. The amino groups further react with other isocyanate groups and lead to a cure of the polymer. To protect the isocyanate containing polyurethane polymers from moisture, it has been proposed to react the isocyanate groups with a blocking agent having a single active hydrogen group which reacts with an equivalent amount of isocyanate groups. This linkage will be stable at low temperatures but will disassociate at elevated temperatures liberating the isocyanate groups. In the deblocked state at an elevated temperature, this product remains in equilibrium with the blocking agent and is reactive with crosslinking compounds that it comes in contact with. The temperature at which the blocked isocyanate groups will form and will deblock primarily depends upon the nature of the blocking agent, although other aspects of the curing reaction also depend on the nature of the crosslinker available to react with the deblocked isocyanate groups at deblocking temperatures. It is the object of the present invention to develop a one package polyurethane system that is stable at room temperature and cures by heating at a moderately elevated temperature. A feature of the present invention is such a system comprising a polyurethane prepolymer having oxime blocked isocyanate groups together with a curing agent. The polymer system so developed has been compounded into a sealing compound which is of particular utility for filling the seams on auto body assemblies. More in particular, seams filled with such a sealing compound can be painted over with the high solids acrylic enamel paints now widely used in the automotive industry and can be cured at the temperatures used for drying and curing such enamels. It has been taught in the art and widely described in the literature that phenol and phenol derivatives can be used to block the isocyanate groups of polyurethane prepolymers to eliminate their sensitivity towards reaction with atmospheric moisture. Single package curable polyurethane resin compositions containing a polyisocyanate prepolymer having phenol blocked isocyanate groups are taught in Bolger U.S.patent 3,886,228, for instance. Blocking reactions between isocyanates and such phenolic compounds require heating the reactants at temperatures ranging from 80 0C to 150 0C. Consequently, these blocked polyurethane systems need still higher temperature to deblock and liberate free isocyanate groups available for crosslinking. According to the present invention, a branched liquid polyurethane prepolymer containing terminal isocyanate groups is reacted with an oxime so that one equivalent of the oxime blocking agent is reacted with one isocyanate equivalent of the polyurethane material. The reaction is conveniently carried out with continuous agitation at room temperature, rather than at an elevated temperature as is required with phenol blockers, until the reaction mixture shows no isocyanate groups present on testing with infrared analysis. The resulting reaction product is insensitive to atmospheric moisture contamination and is not reactive towards isocyanate reactive crosslinkers or curing agents at ambient temperatures. Hence, heat curable compositions stable at room temperature can now be compounded by adding a curing agent having at least two active hydrogen groups per molecule to such a blocked product. Finally, sealants can be compounded from such a mixture by adding conventional fillers and other additives to achieve desirable flow properties and thixotropy. Such heat curable compositions and sealants can be cured by heating at temperatures as low as 250 0F 121 0C for about 30 minutes, or at higher temperatures for shorter times, because of the deblocking properties of the oxime blocked isocyanate prepolymer. Curing in the present specification and claims refers to the development of a Shore A hardness of at least 60 65 at the times and temperatures indicated. It is a further object of the present invention to develop sealants comprising such blocked polyurethane prepolymers wherein the polymers are branched so that when they are deblocked by heat they react with the available curing agent to form a cross linked thermoset polyurethane network. Such curing agents can be polyols, polyamines, or polyamines blocked by reaction with an anhydride. Such blocked polyamine products have been widely used as latent hardeners for epoxy resins.The preparation and use of such blocked polyamines is disclosed in U.S. patent 3,639,657 to Moran et al. The use of such a blocked amine curing agent permits the incorporation of an epoxy resin into the resin or sealant composition without affecting the shelf stability of the epoxy resin. On heating such a mixture of blocked polyurethane, epoxy, and blocked amine, the deblocked amine reacts simultaneously with the deblocked isocyanate groups as well as with the available epoxy resin to form an interpenetrating polyurethane epoxy copolymer of a kind discussed byFrisch et al. in Modern Plastics, May, 1977, p. 84. The isocyanate terminated polyurethane polymers of the invention are preparable by the reaction of an organic polyisocyanate with a polyhydroxy compound.If part or all of the polyhydroxy compound has an hydroxy functionality of more than two hydroxy groups per molecule, the polyurethane reaction product is not linear but branched. When later crosslinked, such a branched polymer develops a thermoset polyurethane elastomeric character. In this reaction, the polyisocyanate is employed in excess so that the resultant polymers have isocyanate terminals. The polyols that may be used are the same as those commonly employed in the prior art for preparing polyurethane resins, e.g. polyester polyols and, particularly, polyether polyols. The polyester polyols include lactone polyols prepared by the polymerization of lactones, compounds such as castor oil, and polyester polyols formed by the reaction of alkylene glycol with a dicarboxylic acid, for example. The polyester polyols maybe formed either in sits or not in situ.Polyether polyols may be prepared by forming alkylene oxide adducts of the polyester polyols and lactone polyols discussed above, or by the reaction of alkylene oxides with materials such as castor oil. However, the preferred polyether polyols are polyoxyalkylene polyols, e.g. polyoxalkylene diols prepared, for example, by the homopolymerization or copolymerization of materials such as ethylene oxide and propylene oxide. Polyoxyalkylene triols, for example linear compounds having pendant hydroxy groups or having branched polyether chains, may also be employed as starting compounds in admixture with diols. Further suitable polyols are polyhydroxy polysulphide polymers of the formula HO X SS Y SS n X OH, wherein X and Y are each divalent aliphatic groups and n has a value of from 1 to 100. In one embodiment according to the present invention, some of the polyol compound or mixture of polyols may be replaced with water. The water, on reaction with isocyanate, releases carbon dioxide and forms an amino group. The latter in turn reacts with further isocyanate groups to form urea groups. In this embodiment, up to 25 percent of the equivalents of isocyanate reactive OH groups contributed by the polyol may be replaced by an equal number of equivalents of water. Preferably, the polyol employed in this embodiment is an aliphatic polyol such as a polyoxyalkylene polyol. Another embodiment according to the present invention involves the replacement of some of the polyol compound with a polyol containing diglycidyl ether groups. It has been reported in the literature, e.g. the 25th Annual Technical Conference, 1976,Reinforced Plastics Composites Division, The Society of Plastics Industry Inc., Sec. 3 A, Page 1, byC. G. Schwarzer, that the reactivity of the diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A may be increased tenfold by placing a methylol group in the ortho position adjacent to the glycidyl ether group. An example of such compound is dimethylol derivative of BisphenolA diglycidyl ether group of the formulaEMI7.1 The incorporation of such a polyol into the urethane chain will yield a urethane chain having pendant epoxy groups which can be cross linked later with a blocked amine curative.Such a crosslinked system will comprise a urethane epoxy copolymer with the toughness and abrasion resistance properties of polyurethane elastomers coupled with the properties of rigidity and strength of crosslinked polyepoxides and their heat, electrical, and chemical resistance. The organic polyisocyanates which are reacted in excess with such polyols for formation of the isocyanate terminated polyurethane prepolymers of the present invention are those taught, for example, inBrode et al. U.S. patent 3,632,577. That is, they are aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, araliphatic, or aromatic polyisocyanates, suitably di and or tri isocyanates. Particularly preferred materials for use according to the present invention are diphenyl methane 4,4 diisocyanate having aromatic characterisitics, the cycloaliphatic diisocyanate 3 isocyanatomethyl 3, 5,5 trimethylcyclohexyl isocyanate isophorone diisocyanate , and dicyclohexyl 4,4 methane diisocyanate.Mixtures of two or more of these preferred materials are also preferred for use in the present invention. As known in the art, the polyols and polyisocyanates are suitably reacted at a temperature between OOC and 12QOC, preferably between 250C and 900C.The reactions are carried out under an inert atmosphere such as a nitrogen blanket and under anhydrous conditions.The reaction may suitably be carried out in the presence of a catalyst The stannous salts of carboxylic acid, such as stannous octoate, stannous oleate, stannous acetate and stannous laurate are known as catalysts for the formation of urethanes. Also, dialkyltin dicarboxylates such. as dibutyltin dilaurate and dibutyltin diacetate are known in the art as urethane catalysts, as are tertiary amines with tin mercaptides.The amount of catalyst employed is generally between 0.005 and 5 by weight of the mixture catalyzed, depending on the nature of the isocyanate. The polyols employed in this reaction, having two ore more hydroxyl groups, generally have a molecular weight between about 500 and 6000 and have hydroxy equivalent weights between 50 and 2000. The preferred polyoxyalkylene polyols, such as polyoxypropylene, have hydroxy equivalent weights between 200 and 2000. These materials are reacted with excess isocyanate until the isocyanate content in the prepolymer is close to the theoretical value, as determined by titrating the free isocyanate groups in a sample of the prepolymer with dibutylamine.The resulting prepolymers having terminal isocyanate groups have molecular weights between about 3000 and about 10000. The preferred prepolymers have a molecular weight between about 3000 and 600Q and have a moderate viscosity which facilitates their further reaction with an oxime blocking agent to produce the polymer mixtures of zero isocyanate content according to the present invention. The oxime blocking agents for the free isocyanate groups contain an active hydrogen atom which react with the isocyanate groups at room temperature in an equilibrium reaction which can be represented asEMI9.1 where R is a polyurethane chain and R and R taken alone are hydrogen, aliphatic or aromatic groups, or, taken together with the carbon atom to which they are attached, are part of 5 or 6 membered aliphatic or aromatic ring. At moderately elevated temperatures the reaction proceeds from right to left generating free isocyanate groups which react with the curing agent present in the system. Oximes useful as blocking agents according to the invention include acetophenone oxime,EMI10.1 acetone oxime,EMI10.2 methyl ethyl ketoxime,EMI10.3 and cyclohexanone oxime,EMI10.4 Other oximes which can be used as blocking agents are propyl aldehyde oxime, formaldoxime, butyl aldehyde oxime, cyclopentanone oxime, benzophenone oxime, and methyl isobutyl ketone oxime. Methyl ethyl ketoxime and cyclohexanone oxime are preferred for use in the present invention because of the low deblocking temperature of the blocked compound formed with these oximes. In the heat curable compositions and sealants of the present invention, such blocked polyurethane prepolymers are generally combined with an amount of a crosslinking agent such that there are substantially equivalent numbers of blocked isocyanate groups and active but possibly blocked hydrogen atoms present in the mixtures. The polyol curing agents which can be used as crosslinkers for the isocyanates when deblocked by heat are the same kinds of compounds as are used to manufacture the polyurethane prepolymer. These include polyester polyols and polyether polyols like those already disclosed earlier herein as useful for the synthesis of the isocyanate terminated polyurethane prepolymer. The polyamine crosslinking agents which are mixed with. the blocked prepolymer can be a polyamine or mixture of polyamines having the active amino hydrogen atoms needed to crosslink the isocyanate groups after the latter are deblocked by heat. Examples of such polyamines are 4,4 methylene bis orthochloroaniline , methylene dianiline, methylene bis 2 methoxyaniline, 2,3,5 trichloro 4,4 methylene dianiline, o phenylene diamine, m phenylene diamine, p phenylene diamine, 2,6 dichloro p phenylene di amine, tolylene 2,4diamine, tolidine, dianisidine, diphenylether 4,4 diamine, 4,4 diphenyl diamino sulphone, 3,3 diphenyl diamino sulphone, naphthalene 1,5 diamine, 2,4 diamino cumene, m tolylene diamine, p chloro phenylene diamine, o chloro p phenylene diamine, m xylylendiamine, 2,4 bis p aminobenzyl aniline, and aromatic diamines represented by the formulaEMI11.1 wherein R is CH3, C2H5, C3Hg, C6H13, C8H17, CH CH3 CH2 3 CH3, or CH2 CH CH3 2 and R is H, CH3, C4Hg or C6H13. Other suitable amines are the aromatic diamines represented by the formula EMI12.1 wherein R is CH3, C2H5, C3H7, nC4Hgt iC4Hg, CH2 2 OCH3, CH2CH CH3 2, C18H37, or CH2 CH C2 5 2 3 3 and R1 is CH3, C2H5, C3H7, or iC4Hg. Other suitable amines are aliphatic polyamines such as hydrazine, ethylene diamine, trimethylene tetramine, diethylene triamine, hexamethylene 1,6 diamine, and propylene diamine, and cycloaliphatic polyamines such as 1,3 bis aminoethyl cyclohexane, bis p aminocyclohexyl methane, and 3 aminomethyl 3,5,5, trimethylcyclohexyl amine isophorone diamine . A further group of amine curing agents are the blocked polyamines obtained by the reaction of approximately equimolecular amounts of an anhydride selected from the group consisting of phthalic anhydride, hexahydrophthalic anhydride, tetrahydrophthalic anhydride, methyltetrahydrophthalic anhydride, polyazelaic anhydride, succinic anhydride, and dodecenylsuccinic anhydride with a polyamine selected from the group consisting of ethylene diamine, diethylene triamine, triethylene tetramine, 1,3 diamino propane, 1,6,diaminohexane, imino bis propylamine and methyl imino bis propylamine at a temperature from about 500C to about 160 0C in a non aqueous medium as described in Moran et al. U.S. Patent 3,639,657. The blocked polyamine curing agent preferred for use in the present invention is the reaction product of phthalic anhydride and diethylene triamine. For formulating seam sealant compositions, the mixtures of polymer and curing agent of the invention are combined with fillers and additives known in the prior art for use in elastomeric compositions. By the addition of such materials, physical properties such as viscosity, flow rate, sag, and the like can be modified. However, to prevent premature reaction of the moisture sensitive isocyanate groups of the polymer after deblocking, the filler used should not contain an excessive amount of moisture. Exemplary filler materials and additives include materials such as carbon black, titanium dioxide, clays, calcium carbonate, surface treated silicas, ultraviolet stabilizers, antioxidants, and the like. This list, however, is not comprehensive and is given merely as illustrative. A better understanding of the present invention and of its many advantages will be had by referring to the following specific examples, given by way of illustration.
