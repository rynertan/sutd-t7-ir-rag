# PROCESS FOR REGENERATING RESIN

## Abstract
A process for regenerating a resin, comprises the steps of dissolving a waste resin in an organic solvent to provide a resin solution, mixing the resin solution with a liquid of normal temperature, the liquid being immiscible with the solvent, scarcely dissolving the resin, and having a specific gravity smaller than that of the solvent and larger than that of the resin, thereby separating the resin from a mixture of the resin solution and the liquid, and recovering the resin. The liquid may have a temperature higher than the boiling point of the solvent. In this case, the solvent evaporation takes place together with the resin separation. The evaporated solvent is cooled later for recovery of the solvent.
