# Granule producing apparatus.

## Abstract
A granule producing apparatus comprises a container 1 an exhaust means 2, 3 provided to the top of the container a space in the upper interior of the container for separating solid material from gases a space for a fluid bed in the lower interior of the container a porous floor 8 immediately below the fluid bed space for defining the lower limit of the fluid bed an air chamber 10 beneath the porous floor for supplying air streams to form the fluid bed a means for supplying jet stream of air, provided below the fluid bed air stream supply chamber a plurality of parallelly arranged funnels 6 , said each funnel consisting of an inverse truncated cone 7 and a cylindrical pipe 9 con nected to the lower end of the cone, said upwardly enlarged cone opens into the interior of the container with its upper end merging with the porous floor, said each cylindrical pipe having its lower end connected to the jet stream supply means a means 14 disposed within the upper portion of the cylindrical pipe of each funnel for spraying liquid under pressure into the jet air stream so that the sprayed liquid adheres to the granules and solidfies as it dries a means 4 fitted to the side wall of the container for supplying granules into the fluid bed space and a means 5 fitted to the side wall of the container for discharging the granules treated out of the fluid bed space.
