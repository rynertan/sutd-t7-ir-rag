## Description
DESCRIPTIONELECTRICALLY CONDUCTING COMPOSITIONS DERIVED FROM POLY PHENYLENE BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention This invention relates to electrically conducting compositions, useful as electronic and optical materials, comprising the solid polymer poly phenylene and electron donor or acceptor materials, or mixtures thereof.2. Brief Description of the Prior Art The electronics industry is continuously searching for new and improved materials for fabricating electronic components. Likewise, the plastics industry is in need of materials which have the property advantages of conventional organic polymers, but which are also electrically conducting. There is a special need in these industries for obtaining conducting materials exhibiting direct current conductivities of at least about 10 4 ohm 1 cm 1, and preferably greater than one ohm 1 cm 1, which also have the desired processibility, mechanical properties, low cost, and low density characteristics of carbon backbone organic polymers. Carbon backbone polymers, possessing conductive properties, can be prepared by pyrolyzing or graphitizing organic polymers. Such resulting conductivity is most likely due to the formation of electrically conducting graphitic structures. However, such pyrolyzed or graphitized polymers are difficult to prepare in a controlled fashion, most likely exhibit undesirable variation in electrical properties, and are not conveniently processible. The only non pyrolyzed non graphitic carbonbackbone organic materials known in the art with conductivities as high as 104 ohm 1 cm 1 are complexes of unsubstituted polyacetylene, HC CH x, with specific electron donor or acceptor agents. This is currently the state of the art despite the fact that researchers have tried for over twenty years to obtain highly conducting complexes of earbonbackbone polymers. Recent efforts in the field to discover substituted polyacetylenes which also form highly conducting complexes, comparable to those of unsubstituted polyacetylene, have not been successful. Complexes of uncrosslinked polyacetylene with iodine, iodine chloride, iodine bromide, sodium, and arsenic pentafluoride having conductivities ranging from that of the undoped polymers to between 50 to 560 ohm 1 cm 1 at 2500 have been described in J. Am. Chem.Soc. 100, 1013 1978 . Also described therein are complexes of polyacetylene with hydrogen bromide, chlorine, and bromine having conductivities of up to at least between 7 X 10 4 and 0.5 ohm 1 cm 1, where the highest conductivity in this range is for the bromine complex. L. R. Anderson, G. P. Pez, and S. L. Hsu inJ. Chem. Soc., Chemical Communications pp. 1066 1067 1978 describe bistfluorosulfuryl peroxide, FSO 2OOSO2F, as a dopant for polyacetylene to produce a composition having a room temperature conductivity of about 700 ohm lem 1. Also, the reference of J. Chem.Soc. Chem. Comm. pp. 489 490 1978 reports that polyacetylene doped with AgClO4 and AgBF4 provides derivative materials having typical conductivities of up to 3 ohm cm 1 The possible application of polyacetylene complexes as electronic devices is described in App. Phys. Lett. 33, pp. 18 20 1978 . Although such polyacetylene complexes are useful as electronic materials, they possess the disadvantages of environmental and thermal instability of the matrix polyacetylene. For example, even in the absence of oxygen, cis polyacetylene transforms to trans polyacetylene at a rate of few percent a day at room temperature, which could resultIn variation of electrical properties. Additionally, both isomers of polyacetylene readily react with oxygen, thereby changing the electronic properties of either doped or undoped polymer. The infusibility and insolubility of high molecular weight polyacetylene further precludes melt or solution processing and the thermal reactivity in the form of crosslinking reactions additionally precludes molding this polymer into shaped articles. In contrast to polyacetylene, poly phenylene is a conjugated polymer having unusually high thermal and oxidative stability. The highest stability has been obtained for poly phenylene which largely consists of para phenylene linkages EMI3.1 and which is commonly referred to as poly p phenylene .This polymer is stable at temperatures as high as 4000C in air and 5500C in inert atmospheres. Furthermore, poly p phenylene exhibits exceptional resistance to radiation damage, as described in J. Polym. Sci. 3, pp.4297 4298 1965 . Another advantage of poly pphenylene is that objects having tensile strengths as high as 5000 psi can be molded from this polymer using powder metallurgical forming techniques without chemical degradation of the polymer, as described in J. Polym.Sci. 22 pp. 1955 1969 1978 . Previous efforts to obtain poly phenylene complexes having conductivities sufficiently high for applications as semiconductors or conductors have been unsuccessful. The highest reported room temperature conductivity is 4 X 10 ohm 1cm 1, which was obtained for a poly p phenylene complex with iodine, as described tn Polymer Preprints 4, pp. 208 212 1963 .The temperature dependence of conductivity, a, is given by the expression a cOe E kT where a0 is amaterial constant, k is Boltzmann s constant 8 .6 X 10 eV degree , T is temperature in OR, and E is the activation energy for conductivity E is reported by these authors to have a value of 0.87 V between room temperature and 1000C. By contrast, a much smaller temperature dependence is normally expected for a material to be a useful semiconductor. The above reference also describes the formation of a complex between poly pphenylene and tetracyanoethylene.However, in this case the observed conductivity at room temperature l0 1l ohm 1 cm 1 is even lower than that observed for the iodine complex. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION We have unexpectedly discovered that electron donors and electron acceptors can be incorporated into poly p phenylene to produce novel materials having electrical conductivities which are continuously adjustable from 10 4 ohm lcm 1 to over 100 ohm lcm 1. In accordance with this invention there is provided a composition comprising a solid poly phenylene , consisting essentially of monomer units having para , meta or orthophenylene linkages, or mixtures thereof, having incorporated therein an electron donor or acceptor doping agent, or mixture thereof, wherein a the direct current conductivity of the composition incorporating the electron donor agent alone is greater than that of the undoped poly phenylene and b the direct current conductivity of the composition incorporating the electron acceptor agent alone, or in admixture with said electron donor agent, is greater than about 10 4 ohm 1 cm 1 said conductivity being measured by the four probe method at room temper ature.Preferred embodiments are where the poly phenylene consists essentially of para phenylene linkages, the conductor doping agent is arsenic pentafluoride, sodium or potassium naphthalene, said agent being present in an amount of about 10 5 to 0.5 mole per mole of monomer units in said polymer. Further provided is a shaped article of manufacture comprising the above described composition.Preferred embodiments of the shaped article are an electrical conductor, a semiconductor, an n p type junction and an infrared radiation absorber. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION AND THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The novelty of this invention is in the discovery that the electrical conductivity of poly phenylene can be surprisingly increased by the addition of specific electron donor agents, or increased to values of about 10 4 ohm 1 cm 1 and greater by incorpo rating into the polymer specific electron acceptor agents, or admixture of donor and acceptor agents. The reason why this result surprisingly occurs is not clearly understood. A theory that we do not wish to be bound by is that a charge transfer complex is formed between the matrix host polymer and the incorporated electron donor or acceptor agent. This complex is strikingly different in electrical properties as contrasted to a simple mixture of the polymer and agent.The complex behaves electrically as a semiconductor or a metal while a simple mixture with an insulating dopant mainly exhibits the electrical properties of the matrix polymer, i.e. a non conductor or an insulator. Thus, the term n incorporated therein does not include simple mixtures of poly phenylene and electron donors or acceptors, or mixtures thereof, where the conductivity is no higher than poly phenylene or the dopant individually. The appearance of optical adsorption bands in the infrared, visible or ultraviolet regions in the doped polymer, which are not present in the dopant or polyphenylene taken separately, distinguishes between a simple mixture and a charge transfer complex. A moderately large number of electron donor or acceptor agents will operate to surprisingly increase the direct current conductivity of poly phenylene , as for example, arsenic pentafluoride, Group IA metals andGroup IA metal arenes. However, not all known doping agents are effective. Bromine and iodine, for example as disclosed below, are known agents for surprisingly increasing the conductivity of polyacetylene to greater than 100 ohm 1 cm 1, but are not effective in increasing the conductivity of poly phenylene to greater than 4 x 10 ohm cm . The reason for this is not clear.A theory that we do not wish to be bound by is that the incorporation of the doping agent into poly phenylene results in the fractional ionization, e.g. sodium atom to sodium cation, of at least about ten mole percent of the incorporated agent. This would be expected to lead then to formation of the charge transfer complex of particular structure resulting in a dramatic increase in conductivity. One skilled in the art from this dis closure will be able to very simply test particular electron donor or acceptor agents, or mixtures thereof, not specifically described herein, in poly phenylene to determine if a dramatic increase in conductivity occurs.Those resulting compositions incorporating an electron donor agent and having a direct current conductivity greater than that of the undoped polymer and those compositions incorporating an acceptor agent, or mixture of donor and acceptor agents, having a direct current conductivity of greater than about 10 4 ohm 1 cm 1, are regarded as also being within the scope of the disclosed invention. By the term four probe method , as used herein, is meant the known and accepted art method of measuring the electrical conductivity of a polymeric film or material using either A.C. or D.C. current between four contacts. A description of the four probe method is made in J. Am. Chem. Soc. 100, pp. 1014 16 1978 , and hereby incorporated by reference for that purpose. Specific details regarding the appardtus and procedure used are given in the Examples. The term npoly phenylene as used herein refers to a generic class of solid polymers containing following repeating monomeric phenylene units EMI7.1 either individually or mixtures thereof. The above monomeric units are also referred to herein, for example in individual instances, as para linkages or paraphenylene linkages. A preferred polymer from the viewpoint of obtaining the highest conductivities for the composition is poly p phenylene polymer consisting essentially of monomer units containing para phenylene linkages. By this is meant that at least about 90 numerical percent of the monomer units are of the para phenylene type as described above. Also, the polymer should be a solid and possess a sufficiently high molecular weight to be insoluble in conventional solvents for maximum conductivity and thermal stability. The molecular weight cannot be reliably determined for high molecular weight poly p phenylene because of the insolubility and infusibility of this polymer. The color of the high molecular weight poly phenylene polymer typically ranges from brown to purple black to black. A wide variety of methods for synthesizing poly phenylene are well known. As an example, benzene polymerizes to poly p phenylene under mild reaction conditions by various combinations of Lewis acid catalysts and oxidizing agents. A particularly efficient system is the aluminum chloride cupric chloride system which provides poly p phenylene in high yield after 0.5 hour at 350C, as described in j. Am. Chem.Soc. 85, 454 458 1963 . As described in J. Am Chem. Soc. 81, pp. 448 452 1959 dehydrogenation of poly l,3 cclohexadiene yields poly p phenylene . These and other methods known in the art are suitable for preparing high molecular weight poly phenylene , characterized by insolubility in conventional solvents, infusibility and a brown to black color, which consists essentially of para phenylene linkages. Such polymers are found in the present work to be most suitable for preparing po ly phenylene complexes having the highest electrical conductivities. Poly phenylene polymer having lower molecular weight, including those continuously down to p quater phenyl, also considered to be a poly phenylene in the subject compositions, or a substantially decreased concentration of para phenylene linkages, have some advantages in solution and or melt processibility. Such polymers can be obtained, for example, by the action of a sodium potass ium alloy on halogen derivatives of benzene, according to the method described in J. Polym. Sci. 16, 589 597 1955 . Other methods for synthesizing poly phenylene polymers which are both soluble and or fusible are described in J. Macromol Sci. Chem. , Al, 183197 1967 . The methods described therein utilize the cationic oxidation polymerization or copolymeri zation of aromatic hydrocarbons such as o terphenyl, m terphenyl, biphenyl, and benzene. All of the references described above relating to synthetic methods for preparing poly phenylene are hereby incorporated by reference for that purpose. Doping agents applicable in the subject compo sitions include electron donor agents, which increase the inherent conductivity of poly phenylene , and acceptor agents, or admixture of donor and acceptor agents which increase the conductivity of poly phenylene to a value greater than about 10 4 ohm cm Preferably, the compositions have a direct current conductivity of about one ohm 1 cm , or greater, as measured by the four probe method at room temperature. Representative examples of applicable doping agents include electron donor agents such as Group IA metals, including lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, and cesium and Group IA metal arenes, such as sodium and potassium naphthalene, sodium and potassium biphenyl and electron acceptors such as Bronsted acids including HC104, non metal oxides including those of SO, and N205 Group V element sulfides including Sb2S5, halides of Groups VIIB, VIII transition metals, IB, IIIA and VA, and halides the inert gases including SbC15, By13, CrO2Cl2, CrO2F2, SbF3Cl2, AsF5, XeFd, XeOF4, SbF Pup5, BF5, By15, SbBr3, CuC12, NiC12 and Moll5, and fluorine containing peroxides including FSO2OOSO2F, or mixtures thereof. Preferred electron donor agents are selected from the group consisting of Groups IA metals and Group IA metal arenes. Particularly preferred are sodium and potassium naphthalenes. Preferred electron acceptor agents are the Group V element halides and particularly preferred is arsenic pentafluoride. The type of dopant chosen depends upon the electronic characteristics desired in the resulting composition. Donor dopants, such as the Group IA metals and Group IA metal arenes, provide an n type conductive material electron conductivity while acceptor dopants, such as AsF5, provide a p type material hole conductivity . Thus, also an embodiment of the subject composition is where the subject composition exhibits the electrical properties of a semiconductor. Preferred embodiments of the subject composition are where the semiconductor is of the n type, or of the p type. The interface between electron donor doped and acceptor doped compositions provides an n p junction which can serve, for example, as a rectifier. Such junctions can be provided by methods well known in the art, such as by mechanically pressing together sheets of n doped and p doped materials. Alternately, one end of a sheet of polymer can be doped with a donor while the opposite end is doped with an acceptor, thereby providing. an n p junc tion at the interface between these differently doped regions. The concentration of conductor doping agent in the composition is from about 10 5 to 0.5 mole per mole of monomer unit in the polymer. The highest conductivity is generally obtained by using either donor or acceptor dopants individually, rather than as a mixture. The conductivity generally increases with increasing dopant concentration and the highest obtainable dopant concentration normally corresponds to less than about 0.5 mole of dopant per mole of monomer units in poly phenylene . The major conductivity increase in going from undoped poly phenylene to the fully doped polymer generally occurs at less than about one fifth of this value. We have found that the halogens, iodine and bromine fail to provide highly conducting poly phenylene compositions, in contrast with the case for polyacetylene. However, we have found that highly conducting compositions are obtained using chlorine as a dopant for poly phenylene . Various methods for incorporating the conductor doping agent into poly phenylene can be employed to form charge transfer complexes These methods include, for example, addition of the doping agent from the gas phase, from solution phase, in the melt phase, or by intimately commingling solid materials. Similarly, electrochemical reactions can be used for the formation of charge transfer complexes of poly phenylene . If very high electrical conductivities are sought, it is important to avoid those doping conditions, such as too high a temperature, which disrupts the covalent bonds in the poly phenylene .molecule, such as by halogenation, sulfonation, or nitration.Preferably, temperatures less than 1000C and less than or equal to room temper ature are typically employed, especially for highly oxidizing dopants such as arsenic pentafluoride. In general, where the doping agent is a gas or a solid, having an appreciable vapor pressure at room temperature, such as arsenic pentafluoride, it is preferred to contact the solid poly phenylene with the doping agent in the gaseous or vapor state and preferably at reduced pressure. Where the doping agent is a solid at room temperature, it is preferred to contact the poly phenylene with a solution of said doping agent in an inert solvent therefor. Representative solvents include diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran and the like.However, basic solvents, such as ammonia, are preferably excluded in acceptor doping if the highest conductivities are desired. The rate of addition of the dopant to the poly phenylene in the vapor phase is normally largely determined by the reaction temperature and the concentration or vapor pressure of the dopant. This rate is not crucial. However, if a complex having the optimized conductivity is required it is desirable to add the dopant at as slow a rate as is consistent with desired rates of manufacture. This normally requires reducing dopant concentration or gas pressure, reducing reaction temperature, and for the case of electrochemical reaction, reducing current flow from those values which provide maximum doping rate. The dopant can be added to the poly phenylene either before, during, or after fabrication of the polymer into the form used for a particular application.For solution andfor melt processible poly phenylenes , conventional polymer processing technology can be used to derive desired forms including films and fibers for the polymer, wherein the dopant can generally be added before dissolution or melting of the polymer, during the solution or melt processing, or after the product shape is provided by the solution or melt processing. For the oly phenylenes which are insoluble and infusible, pressure compaction or pressure sintering techniques can be used to fabricate this polymer into desired shapes, as described in J. Appl. Polym. Sci. 22, pp. 1955 1969 1978 . Again, the dopant can in general be added either before, during, or after the molding process.However, for dopants which lack high temperature stability, the post molding doping process is preferred.This latter process can also provide materials which are conductive on the surface and insulating inside, if the time of dopant exposure is insufficient for dopant diffusion into the bulk of the article. A characteristic feature of preferred compositions of the present invention is that these compositions, rather than being black, like compositions described in the prior art, are instead colored for example, a bronze gold color for heavily doped potassium and sodium complexes and a green metallic color for heavily doped AsF5 complexes. These colors , which generally differ from those of the undoped polymers, reflect the changed electronic structure of the materials. We have unexpectedly found that poly phenylene doped with a high concentration of AsF5, of about 0.2 moles dopant per mole of monomer unit, has a much higher stability than the corresponding heavily doped As F5 complex of graphite. The reference, Materials Science and Engineering 31, 161 167 1977 describes that both StageI and Stage 2 complexes of AsF5 with graphite decompose rapidly in air, accompanied by gross exfoliation and emission of fumes of white solids. Also, AsF5 doped polyacetylene is highly sensitive to air exposure, which results in rapid formation of the cubic modification ofAs203.By contrast, no fume emission or exfoliation is observed with the poly phenylene AsF5 complex and only relatively slow changes occur in electrical conductivity.This complex can also be dipped into water without noticeable change in electrical conductivity. Also a subject of this invention is a shaped article of manufacture comprising the subject composition. Our discovery that poly phenylene forms conductive charge transfer complexes with certain electron acceptors and certain electron donors permits the fabrication of electrical conductors, semiconductor devices, such as rectifying diodes and transistors , n pJunctions, using the subject compositions and the wellknown technologiessof device fabrication from n type and p type materials. The technology applied to the inorganic polymeric material, sun described in Appl.Phys. Lett. 33, pp. 812 814, 1978 hereby incorporated by reference, for the construction of Schottky barrier devices, useful as solar cells, can be used to construct devices from the subject compositions. The subject compositions can function as either the metallic or the semiconductor part of such a metal semiconductor barrier device, depending upon the extent of doping of the polymer A major advantage of poly pbenylene as a junction material in such applications, as compared with the inorganic polymer SN X, or the polyacetylene c omplexes described in Appl. Phys Lett 33, 33,pp. 18 20 1978 , lies in its unusually high thermal stability.Also, highly conducting poly phenylene complexes are also highly absorbing over a wide spectral region in the infrared region. Hence, these materials can be used as infrared absorbers in filtering materials as, for example, in protective eyeglass and solar energy applications. Also, since the subject compositions are conducting, they can be used as anti static materials or devices, such as a shaped gasket inside the lid of a solvent can. Example 1 This example describes the doping of poly phenylene with an electron acceptor AsF5 to produce a highly conducting material. Poly phenylene was prepared by the oxidative cationic polymerization of benzene as described in J. Am.Chem. Soc. 29, pp. 100 104 1964 and hereby incorporated by reference for that purpose. Elemental and functional analyses for the reaction product are in agreement with those described in the above reference for a poly phenylene consisting essentially of para phenylene linkages. One and one half grams of this polymer were pressed into a cylindrical pellet at 2.76 x 105 kPa 40,000 psi in a 2.54 cm 1 diameter stainless steel mold, removed from the mold and annealed at 4000C under ultra high purity, commercially obtained nitrogen gas for 24 hours Four electrodes were painted with an electrically conducting cement, Electrodag , on the flat surfaces of this disk and placed in a colinear arrange ment 1 mm apart. Platinum wires were used to contact these electrodes, so that electrical conductivity could be continuously monitored during doping process using the standard four point probe technique.The sample was then placed in a Pyrex type glass cell with provisions for evacuation, the introduction of dopants, and with glass metal seals to permit exit of wires connected to the four electrodes on the sample. The two outer elec trodes were connected to a Reithley Model 163 current source. The center wires were connected to a Keithlev Model 616 Electrometer for voltage measurement. This arrangement permitted continuous monitoring of the voltage and current, whereby electrical conductivity could be obtained by Ohm s Law calculations. The cell containing the sample was evacuated รถ to about 5.10 torr. At this point the conductivity measured for the undoped poly phenylene pellet 12 out 3 10 ohm cm ohm dm . The AsF 5was added to the conductivity cell in 22 equal increments of dopant during a twd day period, wherein each increment produced about a 3 torr increase in pressure for the cell volume. The electrical conductivity of the poly phenylene progressively increased over the two day period. During this time period the initial purple black metallic appearance of the compressed pellet changed to green metallic. The final conductivity achieved after the 22th increment during the two day period was 130 ohm lcm 1. This conductivity is greater than that of the original polymer by a factor of about 10 4 The conductivity decreased slightly to about 120 ohm lcm l upon standing in dynamic vacuum overnight.The tempera ture dependence of conductivity was measured down to 770K, where the conductivity observed was 50 ohm cm The observed temperature dependence from room temper ature down. to 770K can be described by an Arrhenius expression wherein the activation energy is calculated to b.e 0.01 eV. Example 2 Example This example describes the preparation of a highly conducting material by treatment of poly phenylene with an electron donor, potassium naph thalene, and the control of such conductivity through subsequent treatment with an electron acceptor material, arsenic pentafluoride. Poly p phenylene powder, prepared as inExample 1, incorporating four parallel platinum wires, was compressed into a 12 mm diameter disc shaped pellet at 8.27 x 105 kPa 120,00 0 psi . The embedded wires were exposed by cutting away portions of the solid pellet until the exposed portions were long enough to permit attachment to the four point probe conductivity apparatus described in Example 1. After heating at 4000cm for 24 hours under ultra high purity nitrogen gas, the wired pellet was positioned in a Pyrex glass cell along with 0.8 g powdered potassium naphthalene.. The cell was evacuated and oxygen free tetrahydrofuran THF admitted until the pellet was totally immersed in the potassium naphthalene solution. Conductivity in the pellet increased over a period of 96 hours until a level of 7.2 ohm lcm 1 was attained. Washing the pellet, now a bronze gold color, thoroughly with THF and drying under vacuum did not affect this conductivity value. The thoroughly washed pellet was then exposed to arsenic pentafluoride at a pressure of 45 torr. The conductivity value dropped to 0.57 ohm cm after 33 minutes, then increased once cm to 44 ohm lcm 1 in two more hours. The conductivity of the potassium treated poly p phenylene decreased slightly when the pellet was cooled to liquid nitrogen temperature. The subsequent treatment with arsenic pentafluoride gave a material whose conductivity decreased from 44 ohm cm 1 to 24 ohm 1 cm 1 when cooled to liquid nitrogen temperature. Example 3 Poly p phenylene powder, prepared as inExample 1, was compression molded at 8.27 x 105 kPa 120 psi pressure into five different cylindrical pellets, each 1.25 cm in diameter and about 0.1 cm thick. These pellets were annealed at 4000C under dry nitrogen gas for 24 hours and weighed after returning to room temperature. Electrodes were attached to one of the pellets sample 1 as described in Example 1. This pellet was suspended in the conductivity apparatus by four platinum wires attached to the electrodes as described in Example 1. The remaining four pellets were placed on a platinum screen support in the conductivity apparatus, which was evacuated to 10 6 torr.The conductivity of sample 1 undoped was about 10 12 ohm 1 cm 1. Conductivities of the other samples were not measured prior to doping. Arsenic pentafluoride, in the vapor form, was introduced into the conductivity apparatus at a pressure of 455 torr and the conductivity was measured as a function of time after exposure toAsF5 and the results listed below in Table I. TABLE I AsF5 Exposure Time Conductivity, hours 1 cm 1 ohm 0 leo 12 0.1 0.27 0.2 0.41 0.5 0.70 1.0 1.4 2.0 5.5 3.0 72.3 4.0 140.3 5.0 154.9 After five hours of exposure to AsF5, the cell was evacuated to 10 6 evacuated to 10 6 torre The conductivity decreased slightly on evacuation to 145 ohm 1 cm 1 after 16 hours.The conductivity apparatus was transferred to a N2 filled glove bag. Samples 2 through 5 were weighed and their conductivities measured in the glove bag. Results are shown below in Table Ir. The conductivities of the pellets were measured using a Jandel Engineering Ltd.four point probe apparatus and the Keithley Voltmeter and current source. TABLE II wt.

The average weight fraction of AsF5 in the doped samples. was 0.37 this corresponds to a 0 .21 mole fraction of AsF5 in C6H4 x or about one AsF5 molecule per four monomer units. The conductivity of sample 1 was measured as a function of time under exposure to laboratory air. No visible fumes or visible exfoliation of the sample were observed during air exposure.The conductivity results are listed below in Table III.

After five hours, Sample 1 was dipped in water for about 1 minute the conductivity was unaffected. Example 4 The following example illustrates doping alternately with n type and p type dopants. A 1.0 cm diameter x 0.1 cm thick pellet of poly p phenylene was prepared using the method described in Example 1. After annealing at 4000C under nitrogen gas for 24 hours, the pellet was exposed to AsF5 vapor until the conductivity the pellet increased to 1.1 x 10 2 l of the pellet increased to 1.1 x 10 2 ohm 1 cm 1. At this point the apparent activation energy for conductivity was 0.02 eV. The doped pellet was then exposed to ammonia gas. Within ten minutes the 8 decreased to 1 x 10 8 1 1 conductivity decreased to 1 x 10 ohm cm . After evacuation of the cell to 10 5 torr, the conductivity further decreased to 10 11 ohm 1 cm 1. Example 5 IComparative Example The following example demonstrates that bromine does not form a highly conducting complex with poly p phenylene . A 2.54 cm 1 diameter by 0.1 cm thick poly phenylene pellet was prepared by pressing 2 qm of poly phenylene at 2.76 x 105 kPa 40,000 psi . This pellet was annealed for 24 hrs at 4000C under nitrogen gas. The electrode and sample configuration were the same as described in Example 1. After evacuation to 10 6 torr, the conductivity of the undoped sample was 6 x 10 12 ohm 1 cm 1. Br2 gas was introduced into the chamber, whereupon the conductivity rapidly increased to 10 7 7ohm 1 cm 1.After 20 hours exposure to Br2, the conductivity reached a peak value of 1.0 x 13 6 ohm 1 cm 1. After 40 hours exposure to high vacuum, the conductivity decayed to 1.4 x 10 7 7 ohm 1 cm 1 A temperature dependence was recorded at this point yielding a calculated activated energy of 0.3 eV. Example 6 This example describes the preparation of a highly conductive material by treatment of poly pphenylene with an electron donor sodium naphthalene . Poly p phenylene powder, as prepared inExample 1, was compressed into a disc shaped pellet 12 mm in diameter, 1 mm thick at 8.27 kPa 120,000 psi After heating at 4000C for 24 hr under high purity nitrogen gas, the metallic purple colored pellet was placed in one leg of an H shaped Pyrex glass cell.This cell is designed to allow Irrigation of the pellet by a THF solution of sodium naphthalene prepared by interacting sodium metal 0.1 g with naphthalene 0.6 g in dry, 02 free THF in the other leg. After 24 hr of contact with the pellet, the sodium naphthalene solution was filtered off and the pellet washed in dryTHF until no discoloration of the wash liquid occurred.Drying the pellet overnight under a vacuum of 5 x 10 6 torr gave a golden brown material which showed signs of swelling and flaking. Measurement of conductivity with an ohmmeter in a strictly controlled dry argon atmos phere gave a lower limit of 2 x 1 phere gave a lower limit of 2 x 10 ohm 1 cm 1 for the conductivity. Example 7 Two 4 mg KBr pellets were prepared by compres sion with an applied torque of 23.7 N.m 210 inch poun in a MiniPresst pellet maker for infrared spectroscopy.One mg of poly p phenylene , prepared as in Example 1, was compressed onto the surface of one of these pellets using the above molding conditions. An IR spectrum was taken of the poly phenylene KBr pellet as the sample and the KBr pellet as the reference. Both of these pellets were contacted with AsF5 vapor using the same method as described in Example 1.An IR spectrum was again taken with poly phenylene AsF KBr as the sample and KBr pellet as the reference. 5 The spectrum for undoped poly phenylene was identical to that reported in J. Org. Chem., 29, pp. 100 104 1964 , with prominent vibrational transitions at 800, 1000, 1400 and 1480 cm 1. These vibrational transitions are completely masked in the doped sample which shows large increases in infrared absorption over the range from at least 4000 cm 1 down to at least 200 cm 1, which are the limits of the measurement. On exposure of the doped pellet to NH3 vapor, the infrared absorption dramatically decreases and the vibrational transitions associated with the undoped polymer reappeared. This effect is due to compensation of the AsF5 acceptor by the NH3 donor as discussed in Example 4.This experiment demonstrates that the conductive complex strongly absorbs over a broad band in the infrared, which indicates that such materials can be used in applications requiring an infrared shield, such as in solar energy and optical applications. Furthermore, the reversibility of the optical behavior demonstrates that the novel properties of the subject compositions do not arise because of covalent bond formation, between a dopant species and the polymer chains, such as the replacement of the chain hydrogens with halogens. It is well known in the art that less easily reversible reactions such as sulfonation, nitration and halogenation will occur if a highly oxidizing chemical is added at too high a temperature. Example 8 The doping of p quaterphenyl, the four phenylene unit poly p phenylene , with the electron acceptor, AsF5, gives a highly conducting material. A 12.7 mm 1 2 disc shaped pellet of commercially obtained p quaterphenyl powder pressed at 8.27 x 105 kPa 120,000 psi was attached to a four point conductitivity measuring apparatus, as described inExample 1. The conductivity cell containing the wired pellet was evacuated to 5 x 10 6 torr and then 7 torr ofAsF5 was Introduced throughout the vacuum line, including the conductivity cell. Almost immediately the pellet changed color from ivory to a light green, with an accompanying rise in conductivity. The contents of the vacuum line were condensed into the cell using liquid nitrogen and then the cell was allowed to warm to room temperature. The pellet s color deepened through dark green to a metallic purple the conductivity of the pellet at this point was 3.9 x 10 3 ohm 3 cm 3. After 30 minutes another 7 torr pressure increment of AsF5 was condensed into the conductivity cell. After warming to room temperature the pellet had blackened. The conduc l 1 l tivity rose to 1.2 x 10 1 ohm 1 cm 1. After exposure under these conditions for 18 hours the conductivity was 8 9 h 1 1
