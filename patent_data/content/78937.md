## Description
REINFORCED THERMOPLASTIC COMPOSITION The present invention relates to molding compositions comprising mixed polyesters reinforced with glass.More particularly, it relates to rapidly crystallizing blends comprising poly ethylene terephthalate and a minor proportion of poly 1,4 butylene terephthalate , reinforced with filamentous glass and optionally, but preferably, internally nucleated with sodium stearate. Fox and Wambach, U.S. 3,953,394 disclose polyester alloys comprising from 1 to 99 parts by weight of poly ethylene terephthalate and from 99 to 1 part of poly 1,4 butylene terephthalate . The alloys can be injection molded into parts which do not delaminate when cooled. Fox and Wambach also describe such alloys reinforced with fillers, including filamentous glass and also flame retardant modifications of such compositions. The present invention is based on the discovery of an unusual effect of poly 1,4 butylene terephthalate in 15 glass reinforced poly ethylene terephthalate poly 1,4 butylene terephthalate polyblends. It has been found that if the poly ethylene terephthalate level in 15 glass reinforced blends with poly 1,4 butylene terephthalate is increased by 10 increments, very little effect on the physical properties of molded parts is evident until the 60 70 poly ethylene terephthalate 40 30 poly 1,4butylene terephthalate range is reached. In this range, a rapid drop in heat distortion temperature DTUL deflection temperature under load, ASTM Test D648 at 0,18 daN mm2 occurs.This rapid drop can, however, be moved into higher poly ethylene terephthalate lower poly 1 , 4 butylene terephthalate levels by increasing the mold temperature used for making the work pieces. This reflects a strong effect of poly 1,4 butylene terephthalate on the crystallization of the perytethylene terephthalate in the polyblends, and was apparently not recognized by Fox and Wambach.There is an improved control in warpage at higher poly ethylene terephthalate levels and the property profile remains unaffected at these levels. This unusual effect is due to enhanced crystallinity and will be documented hereinafter. Once the foregoing strong effect on crystallinity had been discovered, numerous experiments were carried out to determine the effectiveness of internal nucleating agents.Fox and Wambach disclose, broadly, that nucleating agents will improve their polyester alloys, especially those having higher ratios of poly ethylene terephthalate . Many of the nucleating agents suggested were tried, but only one, not specifically mentioned, sodium stearate, has been found to produce good heat distortion values and physical properties coupled with the ability to produce opaque, crystalline specimens in thin, thick and large flat parts after injection molding under conventional conditions. In essence, the present invention provides superior molding compositions within the broad disclosure of the above mentioned Fox and Walbach patent, which is incorporated herein by reference.Description of the invention According to the present invention there is provided a reinforced thermoplastic composition which has a high deflection temperature under load at 0.18 daN mm2 and which molds into opaque, crystalline specimens in thin, thick and large flat parts, said composition comprising A a stable, blended resinous combination comprising a. from about 60 to about 90 parts by weight of a poly ethylene terephthalate resin and b. from about 40 to about 10 parts by weight of a poly 1,4 butylene terephthalate resin or a copolyester thereof with a minor amount of an aliphatic or aromatic dicarboxylic dicarboxylic acid or an aliphatic polyol and B from about 5 to about 60 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of said composition of renforcing filamentous glass. Also contemplated is a preferred embodiment which is a composition as defined above which also includes C an internal nucleating amount of sodium stearate, alone, or in further combination with D an effective property improving amount of an oxirane compound. When used herein, and in the appended claims, the term in combination and resinous combination contemplates resins which alloy with each other and which remain intimately combined when cooled and solidified. Moreover, in all of the present compositions, the combinations are stable in the sense that, once formed, the alloys stay permanently homogenous. Therefore, unstable combinations in which resinous components a and b either delaminate or separate when cooled, or in which the gross physical properties, chemical resistance, macroscopic appearance, and the like, clearly manifest faiiure to form stable alloys, are excluded from this invention. The poly ethylene terephthalate resin component a is disclosed in Whinfield et al. U.S. Patent N0 2,465,319. Such polymeric linear terephthalic esters are composed of recurring structural units of the formulaEMI3.1 EMI4.1 Such polyesters will have molecular weights high enough to be film and fiber formers. Poly ethylene terephthalate resins can be made following the teachings of theWhinfield et al patent above mentioned, incorporated herein by reference and are available from a number of sources. Preferred polyester resins for component b will be of the family consisting of high molecular weight, polymeric 1,4 butylene glycol terephthalates having repeating units of the general formula EMI4.2 Also contemplated are mixtures of such esters with minor amount, e.g., from 0.5 to 2 g by weight, of units derived from aliphatic or aromatic dicarboxylic acids and or aliphatic polyols, e.g., glycols, i.e., copolyesters. These can also be made following the teachings of the Whinfield et al patent, above mentioned, suitably modified, if necessary. Poly 1,4 butylene terephthalate is commercially available. Especially preferred polyesters for use as component b are poly 1,4 butylene terephthalate resins.Special mention is made of this polyester because it crystallizes at an especially rapid rate. Among the units which can be present in the copolyesters are those derived from aliphatic dicarboxylic acids, e.g., of up to about 50 carbon atoms, including cyclo aliphatics straight and branched chain acids1 such as adipic acid, cyclohexanediacetic acid, dimerized C16 C18 unsaturated acids which have 32 to 36 carbon atoms , trimerized such acids, and the like. Among the units in the copolyesters can also be minor amounts derived from aromatic dicarboxylic acids, e.g., of up to about 36 carbon atoms, such as isophthalic acid and the like. In addition to the 1,4 butylene glycol units, there can also be minor amounts of units derived from other aliphatic glycols and polyols, e.g., of up to about 50 carbon atoms, including ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, glycerol, cyclohexanediol, and the like.Such copolyesters can be made by techniques well known to those skilled in the art. Illustratively, sufficiently high molecular weight polyesters of type a will have an intrinsic viscosity of at least 0.2 and preferably about 0.4 deciliters gram as measured in chlorophenol, a 60 40 phenol tetrachloroethane mixture or a similar solvent at 250 3O0C., and for type b at least 0.6 and more preferably 0.8, same basis. The upper limit is not critical, but it will generally be about 1.5 dl. g. Especially preferred polyesters will have an intrinsic viscosity in the range of 0 5 to 1.0 for type a and 0.9 to 1.2 for type b . As noted above, poly ethylene terephthalate resins and poly 1,4 butylene terephthalate and or copolyw ester resins are combinable with each other in all proportions. Consequently, alloyed combinations comprising from 60 to 90 parts by weight of poly ethylene terephthalate and from 40 to 10 parts by weight of poly 4, butylen terephthalate resins are included within the scope of the invention. In general, however, compositions containing about 70 parts by weight of the poly ethylene terephthalate and about 30 parts by weight of poly 1,4 butylene terephthalate resins exhibit the best overall combination of properties and these concentrations are preferred.In general, the alloyed combination of polyester components a and b will comprise from about 40 to about 95 parts by weight and the filler will comprise from about 5 to about 60 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the total composition. In particular, the reinforcing filler is glass and it is preferred to use fibrous glass filaments comprised of lime aluminum boro silicate glass that is relatively soda free. This is known as E glass. However, other glasses are useful where electrical properties are not so important, e.g., the low soda glass known as C glass. The filaments are made by standard processes, e.g., by steam or air blowing, flame blowing and mechanical pulling. The preferred filaments for plastics reinforcements are made by mechanical pulling. The length of the glass filaments and whether or not they are bundled into fibers and the fibers bundled in turn to yarns, ropes or rovings, or woven into mats, and the like, are also not critical to the invention. However, in preparing the present compositions, it is convenient to use the filamentous glass in the form of chopped strands of from about 0.32 cm to about 2.54 cm long, preferably less than 0.635 cm long. In articles molded from the compositions, on the other hand, even shorter lengths will be encountered because, during compounding, considerable fragmentation will occur. This is desirable, however, because the best properties are exhibited by thermoplastic injection molded articles in which the filament lengths lie between about 0.0013 cm and 0.32 cm. In general, best properties will be obtained if the sized filentous glass einforcement comprises from about 5 to about oO parts by weight based on 100 parts of the combined weight of glass and polyesters and preferably about 25 to 50 parts by weight. In preparing the compositions of this invention, it is important to use a polyester alloy which crystallizes very rapidly from the melt. polyester alloys which meet the criterion of being rapidly crystallizable from the melt will be those which can be injection molded into a relatively cold mold at about 430C in a standard, short cycle time and produce a rigid workpiece which is highly crystalline throu ghout. As is described in Furukawa et al., U.S. Patent 3,368,995, poly ethylene terephthalate alone, i.e. without nucleating agents will not produce such a workpiece because of its high crystalline meltlng point and low heat conductivity. Because such a polyester resin is not rapidly crystallizable, the outer part of the workpiece is amorphous, and the inner part, which is gradually cooled, is crystalline. One convenient way to determine if a polyester alloy is suitable for use in this invention is to injection mold it with the mold temperature increased to 600 710C. in a standard short cycle, e.g. 10 90 seconds, into workpieces 0.16 cm to 1.27 cm thick. If the molded piece is rigid on removal from the mold and the inner and outer parts of the piece are uniformly milky or white and opaque and if the hardness, measured e.g., with a Rockwell M tester, is uniform throughout, crystallization from the melt is rapid enough to be suitable.If, on the other hand, the workpiece is clear, transparent or semitransparent i.e., crystalline only on the inside if the hardness is non uniform throughout if the workpiece is relatively soft on removal from the mold and brittle after it cools or if uniformity can be achieved only by using a two stage molding cycle, or higher mold temperatures, e.g., 121 16 C and long times, e.g., 90 100 seconds, then the polyester resin alloy is not suitable for this invention. It is to be noted that a precise range of concentration of the polytethylene terepht1Ialate component 2 is contemplated for the present alloys, i.e. 60 to 90 percent by weight of the resinous combination A . The compositions having such concentrations of the poly ethylene terephthalate can be substantially improved by use of a nucleating agent. The prior art suggests a carbon powder, metal salts, clays, talc and the like. None of these is satisfacory, however, if a combination of high heat distortion and high crystallinity after molding at 600 710C mold temperatures is desired.After screening some 120 candidates, only sodium stearate appears to be suitable. This can be used in effective amounts, which can range from 0.1 to 3 based on the total compositions, preferably from 0.1 to 1.0 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of total composition. Among the preferred embodiments are nucleated compositions which also include D a small effective property improving amount of an oxirane compound. These can vary widely in chemical nature, being characterized by the presence of at least one oxirane epoxy functional group.One useful member of the family is the diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A Others are available commercially from a number of sources, such as Dpw Chemical Company, as DER 332, DER 661, and DER 667, and from Ciba Geigy under the trade designationARALDITE Epoxy. These can be used in amounts effective to permit high physicals to be retained, even after melt processing and molding. The amounts in general will range from about 0.05 to 3 based on the total weight of the composition, preferably from 0.1 to 0.5 by weight. The compositions can also be rendered flame retardant with an effective amount of a conventional flame retardant agent. As is well known, flame retardants can be based on elementary red phosphorus, phosphorus compounds, halogen and nitrogen compounds alone or preferably in further combination with synergists, such as antimony compounds.Especially useful are polymeric and oligomeric flame retardant agents comprising tetrabromobisphenol A carbonate units, see, for example, Wambach, U.S. 3,833,685, which is incorporated herein by reference. The method of blending the alloys and compositions of this invention is not critical and can be carried out by conventional techniques. One convenient method comprises blending the polyesters in powder or granular form, extruding the blend and comminuting into pellets or other suitable shapes. The reinforcements and other additives are added in any usual manner, e.g., by dry mixing or by mixing in the melted state in an extruder, on a heated mill or in other mixers. It is always very important to thoroughly free all of the ingredients, the polyester resin s , coblending polymer, reinforcing filler, and flame retardant additives from as much water as possible. In addition, compouding should be carried out to insure that the residence time in the machine is short, the temperature is carefully controlled the frictional heat is utilized and an intimate blend between the resin and the additives is obtained. The compositions can be molded in any equipment conventionally used for reinforced thermoplastic compositions. For example, good results will be obtained in an injection molding machine, e.g., of the Van Dorn type, with conventional cylinder temperatures, e.g., 260 C and conventional mold temperatures, e.g., 660C. If necessary, depending on the molding properties of the eo blending polymer, the amount of reinforcing filler and the rate of crystallization of the polyester component, those skilled in the art will be able to make the conventional adjustments in molding cycles to accomodate the composition.

It is seen that compositions according to Examples 1 and 2 can be molded into parts having excellent properties due to the desirable effect of small amounts of PBT on crysallinity in the polyblend.Examole 3 The composition of Example 1 is intimately admixed with a number of inorganic salts, salts of organic acids, phosphate and sulfate salts, metals, organic compounds alcohols, epoxides, peroxides, esters and ethers , polymeric additives, surfactants, inorganic fillers including silicates, mica, aluminas, talc, graphite, and others and salts of phenol and its additives. These are added at a loading level of 0.5 and examined as potential nucleating agents by mol ding into specimens and checking heat distortion at 0.18 daN mm2 and the appearance of various thin, thick and large flat injection molded specimens, comparing transparent and amorphous vs opaque and crystalline areas. Only sodium stearate is found to give opaque, crystalline specimens in thin, thick and large flat parts, coupled with excellent physical properties.The compositions, which also contain small, conventional amounts of stabilizers and mold release agents, are molded at 430C mold temperature and tested and the properties are summarized in Table 3.
