## Description
This invention relates to a cellular engineering method for improving the cellular metabolic processes of animals, plants, algae, and other microorganisms. More particularly, this invention relates to a cellular engineering method for improving the photosynthetic capacity of C3 plants such as the tomato, tobacco, spinach, soybean, rice, and wheat. This invention resides in a cellular engineering method whereby the rate limiting step s in the photosynthetic CO₂ transporting i.e., from the outside to the CO₂ fixation sites process in C3 plants, cytosol, and or cytomembrane, is are improved to increase the efficiency of the photosynthetic CO₂ fixation by the introduction of a carbonic anhydrase activity into the intracellular space, cytosol, and or cytomembrane. The concentration of environmental CO₂ is one of the eminent rate limiting factors for plant photosynthetic CO₂ fixation, on which world food production is primarily based. This is apparent from the fact that an increase in the environmental CO₂ concentration i.e., usually 0.03 results in an increase of the photosynthetic rate in many species and, therefore, the rate of supply of photosynthetic substrate CO₂ to the carboxylation site is not optimum for the maximum photosynthetic performance. In practice, the so called CO₂ feeding technique has been successfully developed for tomato intensive cultures in green houses in Japan, to increase photosynthesis. Accordingly, the object of this invention is to provide a method of increasing the cellular CO₂ fixation capacity by the introduction of a carbonic anhydrase activity into the cytosol and or cytomembrane of animals, plants, algae, and other microorganisms. That is, this invention provides a cellular engineering method for improvement of the CO₂ fixation capacity of the cells by a direct or genetical introduction of carbonic anhydrase EC 4.2.1.1 activity into the intracellular cytosol and or cytomembrane. In order to increase the photosynthetic efficiency of useful C3 plants in the general field under a low CO₂ condition, besides elevating the environmental CO₂ concentration, it is conceivable to increase the plant leaf affinity towards CO₂ , i.e., to enlarge the pipe of the intracellular CO₂ supply and transport process or to reduce the resistance for CO₂ transport from the surface of the photosynthetic tissue or leaf to the site of CO₂ fixation in the cell. The present CO₂ transporting process of the intracellularly penetrated CO₂ in photosynthetic cells of C3 plants towards the CO₂ fixation site RuBP carboxylase can be reviewed as follows That is, when the CO₂ penetrates, through cytoplasmic membrane from the outside to the cytosol, the CO₂ takes the CO₂ form , instead of HCO₃ or H₂CO₃ and dissolves into the cytosolic stream in the form of an ionic type HCO₃ or CO₂ according to the pH of the medium. Both forms of the carbon dioxide and bicarbonate diffuse toward the CO₂ consuming site, i.e., chloroplasts, according to the concentration gradient in the cell. In the form of CO₂ , inorganic carbon penetrates two layers of the chloroplast envelope into the stroma and dissolves as CO₂ and HCO₃ in a certain ratio according to the pH in the chloroplasts. During photosynthesis, the pH in chloroplasts is calculated to be as high as about 8.0, and in cytosol about 7.0. Henderson Hasselbach s equation leads to the calculation that the HCO₃ CO₂ ratio is around 40 in chloroplasts and the ratio is about 4 in cytosol. It is remarkable that most of the inorganic carbon is present in the form of HCO₃ rather than in the form of CO₂. CO₂ is the substrate form for the photosynthetic enzyme ribulose 1,5 bisphosphate carboxylase RuBP CX instead of HCO₃ . The equilibration rate of the hydration reaction of CO₂ and dehydration of HCO₃ i.e., CO₂ H₂O HCO₃ H is slower than the photosynthetic CO₂ fixation rate in the absence of carbonic anhydrase. Thus, the suboptimum level of carbonic anhydrase in the system might lead to a limiting of the supply of substrate CO₂ for the carboxylation enzyme RuBP carboxylase during light saturated photosynthesis. Fortunately, the carbonic anhydrase activity is found to be predominantly localized in the chloroplasts in C3 plants. The CO₂ penetrated in a chloroplast will be readily equilibrated with two forms of HCO₃ and CO₂ in the actual cells. This will initiate a reduction of the local CO₂ concentration inside the chloroplast envelope and lead to an increase in the gap in CO₂ levels between the outer and inner microcosmos. Accordingly, this will lead to an enhancement of the diffusion rate through chloroplast membranes, and all of the steps described above contribute to an increase in the supply of substrate CO₂ toward RuBP carboxylase, and of simultaneous inhibitor CO₂ RuBP oxygenase Okabe K. et al. FEBS Lett. 114, 142 144 1980 . However, it is apparent that the scarceness of the carbonic anhydrase activity in the cytosol of a C3 plant cell causes the limitation in the rate for the supply of CO₂ the form of penetration through the chloroplast membrane from HCO₃ at the surface of chloroplasts membranes and also the reduction in the diffusion rate from outside of the cell to the cytoplasm because of the decrease in the CO₂ concentration gap between the outer and inner cell membrane caused by the slow equilibration from entered CO₂ to HCO₃ in the micro cytosolic environment. Thus, it is easily understood that the layer of cytosol is the rate limiting step in the photosynthetic CO₂ transporting process. Figure 1 is a schematic diagram showing the intracellular concentration gradient of CO₂ and HCO₃ during the photosynthesis of a C3 plant, as mentioned above. In the figure, Ca indicates the location of the carbonic anhydrase. Consequently, the inventors thought to introduce a carbonic anhydrase activity into the cytosolic layer including cytomembrane of the living C3 plant cells, expecting an increase in the photosynthetic CO₂ fixation capacity under the environmental CO₂ limiting condition. On the basis of the above reasoning, the inventors made an extensive study into the introduction of carbonic anhydrase activity experimentally into cytosol and or cytomembrane, and thus improved the rate limiting step in photosynthetic transport of inorganic CO₂ from the outer surface of a cell to the CO₂ fixation site, i.e., carbonic anhydrase was first introduced into liposomes and the resultant liposomes were fused with protoplasts of the C3 plant. The photosynthetic activities of these protoplasts were measured, and showed a significant enhancement under a lower CO₂ concentration in the medium than that of the control liposome treated protoplasts carbonic anhydrase induction effect . In this experiment, the liposome mediated introduction of carbonic anhydrase showed an activity distribution not only in cytosolic but also in cytomembrane fractions. This evidence supports the concept that the rate limiting step is really at the site of the cytosol and or cytomembrane. It can be understood that the increase in the total inorganic CO₂ level in the process of CO₂ transport is achieved by the introduction of carbonic anhydrase into the cellular space, as shown in Fig. 2. From the foregoing, the introduction of a carbonic anhydrase activity into the cytosolic and or cytomembranous layer is an apparently promising lead to an improvement of the photosynthetic properties in C3 plants, and opens the way to the application thereof to breeding programs for C3 plants. Figure 2 is a schematic diagram showing the concentration gradient of the substrate CO₂ in a photosynthesis of an improved C3 plant. The mechanism of the improved metabolic activity is explained as follows In the Fig. 2, Ca indicates the carbonic anhydrase. Although the above mentioned cellular engineering method consisted of processes of entrapping the enzyme carbonic anhydrase into liposomes, of fusing them with the enzymatically naked host protoplasts, and of the immobilization of the host protoplasts cells, for breeding purposes, a genetic intracellular expression of the carbonic anhydrase activity is required and can be easily achieved by well known techniques of genetic cellular engineering. Thus, the present invention covers the claims of the genetical cellular engineering methods which enable the host cells to express a carbonic anhydrase activity in each cytosol and or cytomembrane in photosynthetic cells in C3 plants after the introduction of the required genetic information relating to the gene expression thereof and the required amino acid sequences into protoplasts, cultured cells or apical meristem cells. A more detailed explanation of the above method is given in the following examples. Through the above procedure, transformants having the above enzyme activity in cytosol and or cytomembrane can be selected. Ti plasmids or their derivatives allow the regenerates to flower and the above properties can be transmitted through seeds. Thus, the present invention is also feasible in the plant breeding field. Typical applications of the present invention for a C3 plant have been described above, however, this invention is not limited to those described. The invention is also applicable for the activation of several metabolic cycles where the HCO₃ level is rate limiting in the above described various cells. This invention is also applicable, for the improvement of secondary metabolites production by immobilized cells bioreactor , because the newly introduced carbonic anhydrase activity might enhance the supply rate of HCO₃ to phosphoenol pyruvate carboxylase catalyst of C1 C3 carboxylation , which plays a key role in the biosynthetic pathways of the above mentioned secondary metabolites, such as amino acids. This invention is set out in more detail in the following examples. Of course, the claims of this invention are not restricted by these examples. Intact protoplasts were isolated and purified from cotyledons of tomato In Fig. 3, the activities detected in the liposome treated protoplasts after thorough washing are plotted versus the incubation time for liposomes protoplasts fusion. After washing, the measured carbonic anhydrase activity corresponded to a number of liposome particles as high as 472 per protoplast and the supernatants contained null activity. After the puncture of treated protoplasts in the isoosmotic condition with chloroplasts by passing them through a 20 mµ pore size nylon filter, about 26 of the introduced carbonic anhydrase activity was recovered in the cytoplasmic fraction supernatant and 74 in the precipitates containing chloroplasts and protoplast membrane. In this experiment, an about 120 times higher level of the intrinsic carbonic anhydrase activity of native protoplast was recovered Table 4 . With the protoplasts prepared as mentioned above, the photosynthetic carbon dioxide fixation activity was measured under a light saturated condition 10,000 lux using NaH¹⁴CO₃ as the substrate. In each measurement, a carbonic anhydrase solution was added to the reaction medium at the final concentration of 0.5 mg ml in 0.25 ml, to avoid limiting the supply of CO₂ from the medium toward the protoplast membrane surface. The reaction was started after 10 min of preillumination by the addition of sodium bicarbonate NaH¹⁴CO₃ at a final concentration of 0.36 mM, 1.25 mM, or 9 mM, and stopped by the addition of acetic acid after 30 sec. The acid stable fixed ¹⁴C was measured by a liquid scintilation counter. As shown in Fig. 4 and 5, the lower the bicarbonate concentration, the more enhanced the photosynthesis of carbonic anhydrase entrapped protoplasts. The above data suggest that the efficiency of CO₂ uptake was increased under photosynthetic limiting CO₂ concentration and protoplastic or cellular photosynthetic efficiency can be elevated until the introduced carbonic anhydrase deactivates. It is remarkable that the experiments shown in Fig. 4 and 5, which are the bicarbonate dependent curves of photosynthetic efficiency relative ratio of liposome mediated carbonic anhydrase introduced protoplasts and the degree of photosynthetic enhancement relative ratio by its introduction, respectively, were designed to be able to clarify the effect of difference s of carbonic anhydrase existence only in the intraprotoplastic space. Photosynthetically highly active protoplasts were prepared from mature leaves of a C3 plant, tomato The photosynthetic property of those leaf protoplasts prepared as mentioned above were determined with respect to the relationship between the O₂ evolution and substrate bicarbonate concentration, using Rank Brother oxygen electrodes according to the procedure flow chart shown in Table 8. Both liposomes treated protoplasts were resuspended in a CO₂ freed buffer, placed in the oxygen electrode vessel with the existence of a carbonic anhydrase solution 42 U ml to avoid limiting the CO₂ supply towards the protoplasts surface and preilluminated until a trace amount of contaminated CO₂ dependent on the O₂ evolution is ended. At around a 21 O₂ partial pressure level, several known levels of substrate bicarbonate were added and a maximum photosynthetic O₂ evolution rate was determined and compared. The relationship of the photosynthetic rate and substrate bicarbonate concentration, shown in Fig. 6, exhibits a substrate bicarbonate concentration dependent on the photosynthetic O₂ evolution. Especially under a low bicarbonate concentration, the carbonic anhydrase entrapped protoplasts showed a higher photosynthetic rate than the control protoplasts. This enhancement by the carbonic anhydrase introduction into protoplasts was higher in a lower bicarbonate concentration region as shown in Fig. 7. The intra protoplastic distribution of the introduced carbonic anhydrase in the above mentioned condition was determined in cytosol fraction and chloroplasts as well as cytomembrane fractions while only trace carbonic anhydrase activity was detected in the cytoplasm of the non treated and control liposometreated protoplasts. From the foregoing, the feasibility of this cellular engineering technique that enables the expression of an increased level of carbonic anhydrase activity in the cytosol and or cytomembrane surface layer of C3 plants is apparent from the view point of the aimed enhancement of CO₂ utilization efficiency in photosynthesis under environmental conditions.
