## Description
The present invention relates to devices for application to the pressure bearing surfaces of, for example, bedridden patients for the prophylaxis of pressure sores. In one particular aspect it relates to devices which comprise a viscous liquid containing a hygroscopic material retained within a flexible, elastomeric envelope. In a second particular aspect it relates to specially shaped devices for use on the sacrum. A prophylactic device for pressure sores consisting of a cross linked water insoluble immobile polyurethane gel contained within an outer envelope has been described in United States Patent No. 0456642. The prophylactic device described therein is adapted to be used as a cushion or a mattress and as such only provides protection to the patient when the patient is actually in position on the prophylactic device. If the patient is moved from where he is on the prophylactic device then he will no longer be afforded protection. European Patent Application No 122035 which is a document which falls under Article 54 paragraph 3 EPC describes a prophylactic device which is removably attached to the body and which comprises a mobile moisture absorbing hydrophilic gel retained within a flexible elastomeric envelope. That device is adapted to move with the patient and indeed may be adhered to the patient for up to seven days or more. For this reason the envelope s body contacting surface is a film which has a moisture vapour transmission rate of greater than United States Patent No. 4255824 describes a cushion for the relief and prevention of decubitus ulcers. The cushion comprises two cylindrical portions, which may be arranged in a V shape, supported by two further cylinders or by a strap passing them. The cylinders are preferably inflated with gaseous material. In one aspect of the present invention, the flexible elastomeric envelope is adapted to provide the device in a special shape. It has been found that the known pressure sore prophylactic devices, when applied to certain parts of the body such as the sacrum, have either provided a decrease in the pressure on the load bearing surface less than an optimal amount or have redistributed the pressure to occasion load stressed areas elsewhere thereby causing a pressure sore. It has now been found that if a device is in the shape of the letter U , then this may be used to provide an excellent reduction in pressure of the sacrum. Accordingly the present invention provides a device for the prophylaxis of pressure sores which comprises a liquid retained within a flexible elastomeric envelope which is formed in the shape of the letter U in which the body contacting surface of the device is a film having a moisture vapour transmission rate of greater than It is intended that where the flexible elastomeric envelope of the device of this invention is described as being in the shape of the letter U , this description shall also include flexible elastomeric envelopes in the shape of the letter C , a horseshoe and flexible elastomeric envelopes in the shape of an interrupted circle i.e., essentially U shaped . Suitably the flexible elastomeric envelope of the device is in the shape of the letter U which flexible elastomeric envelope is suitably between 5cm and 30cm long and preferably 10cm to 20cm long, when measured from the ends of the arms to the base of the flexible elastomeric envelope of the device, and which is suitably between 5cm and 40cm wide and preferably between 12cm and 26cm wide, when measured between the outer faces of the two arms of the flexible elastomeric envelope of the device. Each arm of the flexible elastomeric envelope of the device is suitably between 1cm and 10cm wide and preferably between 5cm and 6cm wide when measured between the outer and inner face of each arm. The two arms of the flexible elastomeric envelope of the device are separated by a gap which has a width of between 1cm and 10cm and preferably a width of between 2cm and 6cm. The base of the flexible elastomeric envelope of the device is suitably between 2cm and 25cm wide and preferably between 5cm and to 15cm wide when measured between the inner and outer face of the base. The thickness of the viscous moisture absorbing liquid filled flexible elastomeric envelope will be suitably between 0.5cm and 3cm and preferably between 1cm and 5cm. When reference is made to the parts of the flexible elastomeric envelope being described as arm , base , outer and inner it is intended that such reference should be the same as the references in the description of the drawing of this application. When reference is made to moisture vapour transmission rate, it is intended that such measurements are carried out by the Payne Cup method which is described below. Suitably the liquid retained within the flexible envelope will be a material which is a viscous liquid and which will absorb moisture vapour. Suitable materials which are moisture absorbing viscous liquids include polyurethanes, polyethylene glycols, propylene glycols, polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene diol block copolymers which have the correct viscosity characteristics and are capable of deforming so as to distribute an applied pressure more or less evenly over their surface. Suitable polyurethane moisture absorbing viscous liquids include those hydrophilic polyurethane gels described in International Application No. WO 85 01306 and European Patent Application No. 155035 which are incorporated hereinafter by cross reference. It is also envisaged that the moisture absorbing viscous liquid could comprise a viscous liquid which contains a hygroscopic material as described below. It has now been found that by including a separate hygroscopic material in the viscous liquid retained within the flexible, elastomeric envelope a device is formed which may have an increased absorptive capacity for moisture and an increased absorption rate. Also the use of a separate hygroscopic material can permit the use of cheaper viscous liquids than the specialised hydrophilic polymers hitherto used. Accordingly the present invention provides a device for the prophylaxis of pressure sores which comprises a liquid retained within a flexible, elastomeric envelope in which the body contacting surface of the device is a film having a moisture vapour transmission rate of greater than Suitable viscous liquids include polyurethanes, polyethylene glycols, propylene glycols, polyxoyethylene polyoxypropylene diol block copolymers which have the correct viscosity characteristics and are capable of deforming so as to distribute an applied pressure more or less evenly over their surface. Suitably polyurethane viscouse liquids include those hydrophilic polyurethane gels described in International Application No. WO 82 01306 and European Patent Application No. 122035 which are incorporated hereinafter by cross reference. Other suitable but more favoured viscous liquids include those made by materials such as polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrolidone, polyacrylamide, polyethylene glycol, carboxymethylcellulose, cellulose and cellulosic derivatives, vegetable gums such as guar gum, gum agar which when added to a suitable liquid such as water cause that liquid to become viscous. Such viscous aqueous solutions are preferred. Less preferred viscous liquids include non aqueous viscous liquids made by the combination of a mineral oil and a gelling agent such as aluminium stearate or a silica such as Aerosil Trade Mark . Other less preferred viscous liquids include gel emulsions containing an oil phase such as mineral oil, an emulsifier such as Brij 52 Brij is a trade mark , a thickening agent such as polyethylene glycol 600 and water. Suitably the viscosity as measured at 39 C using a Ferranti Shirley Cone and Plate Viscometer with a 1 cm radius cone and a 1200g spring at 5 r.p.m. of the viscous liquid will be between 500 and 55,000 Poise and preferably between 1,500 and 6,000 Poise. Suitable hygroscopic materials which may be added to the viscous liquid include inorganic materials such as anhydrous silica gel, anhydrous calcium chloride, anhydrous aluminium oxide and sodium bromide. Other suitable hygroscopic materials include organic compounds such as glycerol, glycerine and propylene glycol. The viscous liquid together with the hygroscopic material when contained in a device will suitably absorb moisture vapour at a rate greater than 50mg 75hr A particularly preferred liquid for retention within the flexible, elastomeric envelope is an aqueous solution of polyvinyl alcohol containing sodium bromide. The viscous liquid containing a hygroscopic material and film forming the walls of the envelope and the adhesive when present are suitably all transparent so that the condition of the skin beneath the device may be monitored during the wearing period. It is envisaged that once applied to the body the device can remain in position for a week or even longer. During this period the moisture produced by normal perspiration of the skin under the device must be removed otherwise the skin will become waterlogged and degenerate. Thus the moisture must be transmitted through the wall of the envelope and absorbed by the viscous liquid containing a hygroscopic material. In both aspects of the present invention described hereinbefore suitable examples for the film which contacts the body of the wearer of the device are described in British Patent Specification No. 1280631 as backing materials, which are incorporated herein by cross reference. Suitable polymers for forming the film are polyurethanes such as those known as Estane Registered Trade Mark of B.F. Goodrich Ltd. Suitable Estanes include Estane 5702, 5701, 571 4F and 580201. Preferred polymers for forming the film are polyetherester block copolymers such as Hytrel Registered trade mark . Suitable Hytrels include Hytrel 4056. Yet other preferred polymers for forming the film are polyether polyamide block copolymers such as Pebax Registered trade mark . Suitable Pebax include Pebax 2533 SN 00. The thickness of the film employed in the device of this invention is chosen to produce the desired moisture vapour transmission rate MVTR . Suitably the thickness of the film which will give the correct MVTR and be sufficiently strong to withstand the pressure applied to it will be in the range 25 to 100 microns. The film will be chosen so that its MVTR will be greater than In one preferred embodiment of the invention, the surface of the device which is to contact the skin will carry an adhesive layer whereby the device may be adhered to the skin in use. We have found that by adhering the device to the skin it is less likely to be dislodged or moved out of place if the wearer moves or is moved or if the moisture absorbing viscous liquid is relatively stiff. Suitable adhesives must be compatible with the skin, that is they will be hypoallergenic. Favourably the adhesives may be synthetic polymers or mixtures thereof. Suitable adhesives may be selected from those described in British Patent Specification No.. 1280631 and European Patent Application No. 35399, both of which are incorporated herein by cross reference. Preferred adhesives are those which have a MVTR such that the adhesive together with the film which is in contact with the skin has a MVTR of greater than Normally the adhesive will be applied to the film in the form of a continuous layer. However it is envisaged that the adhesive could be applied to form a discontinuous or a pattern spread layer. If desired the adhesive may incorporate an antibacterial agent such as a chlorhexidine salt. In a further and much preferred aspect the film which forms the body contacting layer may be extended to form a margin around the moisture absorbing viscous liquid filled envelope. The body contacting layer may carry an adhesive layer for sticking to the skin over the whole of its surface or, less favourably, only on the marginal portions. The adhesive layer may be continuous or discontinuous or a pattern spread layer. In the U shaped device a section between the arms of the U may be removed so that the device when applied to the sacrum would not interfere with natural bodily functions. The envelope may be formed by conventional means from the appropriate polymer film. Suitably the film may be formed into strips or shapes of the appropriate size, folded and heat sealed along two sides to provide an envelope with an opening or the envelopes may be blow moulded from suitable polymer. Alternatively the film which is to form the non body contacting surface may be formed into the appropriate shape by vacuum moulding. The film which is to form the body contacting surface may then be heat sealed to the edges of the vacuum formed shape leaving a small entry port unsealed whereby the viscous liquid may be injected into the envelope before the final seal is made. The body contacting film may be chosen to extend beyond the vacuum formed shape and may be coated with an adhesive. Preferred embodiments of shaped devices of the present invention will now be described by way of example only and with reference to the accompanying drawing in which Figure 1 shows a top view of a device suitable for application to the sacrum of a patient. Figure 1 shows a device with the flexible elastomeric envelope in the shape of a letter U 1 suitable for use around the sacrum of a patient. The two arms 2 of the flexible elastomeric envelope are separated by a gap 3 that is 5cm wide. The width of each arm 2 is 7cm as measured between the outer face 4 of the arm and the inner face 5 of the arm. The width of the base 5a of the flexible elastomeric envelope is 7cm as measured from the outer face 6 of the base to the inner face 7 of the base. The overall length of the flexible elastomeric envelope is 15cm as measured from the ends 8 of the arms to the outer face 6 of the base. The flexible elastomeric envelope is filled with a moisture absorbing viscous liquid to a thickness of 1cm. The walls of the flexible elastomeric envelope are formed from a moisture vapour permeable polyether ester which is approximately 75 microns thick and is heat sealed around its edges to form the U shape. The size of the device will vary depending upon the area of the body to which the device is to be applied. Some suitable applications are described in European Patent Application No. 122035 are incorporated hereinafter by cross reference. Thus small size devices will be applied to the sacrum and heels. Larger devices will be used for application to the elbows as cushions in wheel chairs whilst the largest devices will be used as mattresses. A small size device, in the form of a pad, will have dimensions of 10cm by 10cm approximately . The thickness of the pad will be suitably 0.5cm to 2.5cm, more suitably 0.75 to 2.ocm and preferably 1.0 to 1.5cm, for example 1.4cm. The amount of viscous liquid containing a hygroscopic material which is used will suitably be 50 to 250ml, more suitably 75 to 200ml and preferably 100 to 150ml, for example 140ml. The amount of viscous liquid containing a hygroscopic material required will depend upon the viscosity. Where reference is made to moisture vapour transmission it is intended that such measurements are carried out by the Payne cup method which is described in the following. Discs of the material under test are clampled over Payne Permeability Cups flanged metal cups using sealing rings and screw clamps., The exposed surface area of the test sample is 10cm². Each cup contains approximately 10ml of distilled water. After weighing the cups are placed in a fan assisted electric oven which is maintained at 37 The cups are removed after 24 hours, allowed to cool for 20 minutes and reweighed. The moisture vapour transmission rate of the test material is calculated from the weight loss and expressed in units of grams of weight per square metre per 24 hours. A viscous liquid was made by adding 30gms polyvinyl alcohol m.w. 29,400 grade GL05 to 100gms water. To the resultant viscous liquid was added 100gms sodium bromide. A polyether polyamide copolymer film was extruded in the conventional manner using a melt temperature of approximately 185 C. The resultant film thickness was approximately 170 microns. This film was moulded into the appropriate shape using a vacuum mould. The shape chosen for the device for the heel is that described in EPO Application No. 122035. The average thickness of the film after vacuum moulding was approximately 75 microns. A part of the viscous liquid containing the hygroscopic material prepared above 100 ml was transferred to the larger of the two pouches of the polyether polyamide copolymer film and 25 ml of the viscous liquid containing the hygroscopic material prepared above was transferred to the smaller of the two pouches of the polyether polyamide copolymer film formed in the vacuum mould. A further piece of extruded polyether polyamide copolymer film with a thickness of 75 microns was then heat sealed to the viscous liquid filled pouches in such a manner as to exclude all the air from the two independent envelopes thus formed. The polyether polyamide copolymer film thus sealed to the viscous liquid containing the hygroscopic material filled pouches extended on all sides by 10 cm beyond these filled pouches. This extended area of polyether polyamide copolymer film was coated with a suitable pressure sensitive adhesive at a mass weight of 30gm. The adhesive face of the device was then placed onto a silicone release paper and the whole device sealed into a substantially water vapour impermeable bag for storage. A viscous liquid containing a hygroscopic material was made by dissolving 4 gms hydroxyethylcellulose Natrosol 250 HH Hercules Powder Co. , 34 gm sodium chloride and 17 gm of glycerine in 145 ml water. A polyurethane film was cast onto a silicone release paper at a weight of 60gm using a polyurethane syrup comprising 100 parts of Estane 5714F available from B.F. Goodrich Ltd. , 5 parts of Gasil 23 fine silica available from Crossfield Chemical Ltd. , 240 parts of tetrahydrofuran and 160 parts acetone. The resultant film was cut into strips so that on folding each strip in half and heat sealing the two edges, an envelope approximately 10cm by 10cm was formed. A part of the viscous liquid containing the hygroscopic material prepared above 140 ml was transferred to the polyurethane envelope and the envelope closed by heat sealing along the fourth edge. The resultant pad 10cm by 10cm and 1.4cm thick was suitable for use to prevent formation of pressure sores on the sacrum. A linear polyurethane gel was prepared from the following The first four ingredients were mixed together to form a homogenous mixture whilst warming to 60 C. The catalyst was then added with stirring. The resultant homogenous reaction mixture was poured into a mould and cured in an oven at 90 C for 2 hours. The resultant hydrophylic polyurethane was obtained as a viscous liquid. To 130 gm of this viscous liquid was added a 100 gm sodium bromide. A polyetherester block copolymer film was extruded in the conventional manner using a melt temperature of approximately 185 C. The resultant film thickness was approximately 170 microns. This film was then moulded into the appropriate shape using a vacuum mould. The appropriate shape for a device for the heel is that shown and described in European Patent Application No. 122035. The average thickness of the film after vacuum moulding was approximately 75 microns. A part of the viscous liquid containing the hygroscopic material prepared above 100 ml was transferred to the larger of the two pouches of the polyetherester block copolymer film and 25 ml of the viscous liquid containing the hygroscopic material prepared above was transferred to the smaller of the two pouches of the polyetherester block copolymer film formed in the vacuum mould. A further piece of extruded polyetherester block copolymer film with a thickness of 75 microns was then heat sealed to the viscous liquid containing the hygroscopic material filled pouches in such a manner as to exclude all the air from th two independent envelopes thus formed. The polyetherester block copolymer film thus sealed to the viscous liquid containing the hygroscopic material filled pouches extended on all sides by 10 cm beyond the viscous liquid containing the hygroscopic material filled envelopes. This extended area of polyetherester block copolymer block was coated with a suitable pressure sensitive adhesive at a mass weight of 30 gm. The adhesive face of the devices was then placed onto a silicone release paper and the whole device sealed into a substantially water vapour impermeable bag for storage. A polyether polyamide block copolymer film was extruded in a conventional manner using a melt temperature of approximately 185 C. The resultant film thickness was approximately 170 microns. This film was moulded into the appropriate shape using a vacuum mould. The average thickness of the film after vacuum moulding was approximately 75 microns. The following description of the device is made with reference to Figure 1 and the description thereof. The device was formed in the shape of a U where the arms 2 of the device were approximately 4cm apart and the arms 2 were each approximately 5cm wide. The base 5a of the U shaped device was approximately 5cm wide The length of the device from the top 8 of the arm to the bottom 6 of the base was approximately 13 cm. A moisture absorbing viscous liquid was prepared by adding 30gm of polyvinyl alcohol m.w. 29,400 grade GL05 and 100gm sodium bromide to 100gm of water. A 100ml of the moisture absorbing viscous liquid was then transferred to the device formed from the polyether polyamide film in the vacuum mould. A further piece of extruded polyether polyamide copolymer film with a thickness of 75 microns was then heat sealed to the moisture absorbing viscous liquid filled device in such a manner as to exclude all the air from the envelope thus formed. The polyether polyamide copolymer film thus sealed to the moisture absorbing viscous liquid filled device extended on all sides by 10cm beyond the moisture absorbing viscous liquid filled envelope. This extended area of polyether polyamide film was coated with a suitable pressure sensitive adhesive at a mass weight of 30gm. The adhesive face of the device was then placed onto a silicone release paper and the whole device sealed into a substantially vapour impermeable bag for storage. A film of polyether ester block copolymer Hytrel 4056 was formed in the conventional manner by extrusion to provide a film of thickness of approximately 170 µm. This film was then moulded into the U shaped device as defined hereinbefore and described in Example 4. A second film of polyether ester block copolymer was extruded to provide a film of thickness 60µm. A piece of this film larger than the U shaped moulded film formed above was heat sealed to the edges of the U shaped film leaving a small unsealed area as an entry port for the viscous liquid. A viscous liquid comprising 30g of polyvinyl alcohol dissolved in 100g of water and containing 100g of sodium bromide was injected through the unsealed area into the envelope. Care was taken not to entrap air in the envelope. The entry port was then sealed. The body facing film extended beyond the U shaped envelope by about 10cm on each side. The whole of this film was then coated with a polyacrylate ester copolymer adhesive at a weight per unit area of 30gm. The adhesive face of the device was then placed onto a silicone release paper. A keyhole shaped section was removed from between the arm of the U shaped device so that the device when applied to the sacrum would not interfere with natural bodily functions. A U shaped envelope was formed by a method as described in Example 5. In this example the envelope was filled with the hydrophilic polyurethane gel described in Example 3.
