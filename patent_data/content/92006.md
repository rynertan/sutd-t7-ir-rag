# A ladle preheat station and a method of measuring the temperature of a ladle therein.

## Abstract
A ladle preheat station including a wall 16 , a ladle base 14 for holding a ladle 12 juxtapositioned to the wall 16 on one side thereof, and burner means 20 extending through the wall 16 for firing into the ladle interior 22 . The wall includes a sight tube 30 extending therethrough. An infra red pyrometer 28 is mounted and spaced from the side of the wall 16 opposite the ladle 12 , and is positioned to receive radiation through the sight tube 30 from the ladle bottom 24 and is arranged to produce an electrical signal representative of the temperature of the ladle bottom 24 for control purposes. The sight tube 30 includes a Pyrex Reg istered Trade Mark lens 42 for protecting the pyrometer 28 from excessive heating by radiation from the ladle interior 22 , and a purge system 34, 40, 44 is provided for passing air through the sight tube 30 to prevent contamina tion of the lens 42 by combustion products.
