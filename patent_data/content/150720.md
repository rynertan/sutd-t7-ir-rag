A fryer according to claim 5, characterized in that said rods 28 are welded to the free edges of said vanes 27 in spaced relationship to said shaft 16 Fryer with Electric Heater for Indirect Heating DescriptionThe present invention relates to a fryer, particularly for use in a community kitchen, provided with electric heater means for indirect heating of the frying oil or fat. Electric fryers usually comprise a stainless steel vessel a rear portion of which contains at least one armoured resistance heater hingedly mounted or guided in such a manner that in operation its active heater portion is completely immersed in the oil. In this manner one achieves direct heating of the oil, but because of the low heat transmission coefficient between the heater surface and the oil there occurs a considerable temperature difference of as much as 100 OC or above between the heater surface and the oil. As a result, the oil in contact with the heater surface is subjected to a degradation process which, in addition to rendering the cleaning of the resistance heater difficult, converts some of the oil to substances constituting particular health hazards. A first solution to this problem consists in increasing the heat transmitting surface area of the resistacne heaetr s im proportion to its or their capacity so as to reduce the above noted temperature difference to acceptable values. This solution, however, requires the employ of resistance heaters having excessive dimensions and intricate shapes, thus complicating the design, the use and, above all, the periodic cleaning of the fryer. It has also been tried to solve the above noted problem by inserting an agitator element into the oil bath, but this solution only complicates the construction of the fryer without eliminating the difficulties with regard to cleaning, as the resistance heater is always immersed in the oil in use of the fryer.

## Description
7. A fryer according to claim 5, characterized in thatsaid vanes 27 are of semicircular shape and located in pairs opposite one another at inclined positions with respect to the axis of said shaft 16 , said pairs being disposed at equal spacings along the length of said shaft.8. A fryer according to claim 5, characterized in that said rods 28 are disposed at diametrally opposite positions with respect to the axis of said shaft 16 . Recently there has been proposed a solution making use of indirect heating, according to which the oil is heated in a separate container communicating with the vessel of the fryer and provided with means for forcedly circulating the oil between the vessel and the container. The electric resistance heaters are wound onto the outer wall surface of the container in intimate contact therewith, and possibly even welded or soldered thereto. This solution is advantageous in that it eliminates the shortcomings of fryers with direct heating thanks to the strong turbulence occurring in the heat exchange zone and resulting in a reduction of the temperature difference between the oil and the heating surface. On the other hand, this solution presents certain structural and functional difficulties.To be noted in the first place is the fact that the heating container, which is usually disposed with its axis vertical, is required to have a considerable axial length and thus occupies a considerable vertical space below the bottom of the vessel.In addition, the container has to be provided with an element mounted therein for agitating and circulating the oil and driven by an externally mounted motor. For avoiding problems with regard to sealing the rotating shaft, the motor is preferably mounted above the level of the oil in the frying vessel, i.e. at an uncomfortable and not readily accessible location. Finally, regard should be had to optimum conditions for cleaning the container and particularly the means for forcedly circulating the oil, such conditions being unachievable, however, with the motor mounted at an elevated position.It is an object of the present invention to overcome the above noted difficulties and to provide a fryer operating with indirect electric heating, wherein the container for heating the oil should be rationally integrated into the overall design of the fryer, and wherein the means for forcedly circulating the oil should be conveniently associated with said container so as to ensure proper operation and easy maintenance of the fryer and its parts. The fryer according to the invention thus comprises a stainless steel vessel and a container located adjacent said vessel in communication therewith, said container being provided with electric heater means secured to its outer wal surface and with means for forcedly circulating the frying oil between said container and said vessel, said fryer being characterized in that said container is located adjacent the front side of the fryer and communicates with an expansion zone of said vessel, and in that said means for forcedly circulating the oil comprises a vaned shaft mounted coaxially in said container and having its lower end telescopingly coupled to an electric motor for driving said shaft, the upper end of said shaft being rotatably but non slidably connected to a closure plug of said container, the engagement length of said lower end being smaller than the engagement length of said plug in said container.This arrangement for heating and forcedly circulating the oil is capable of producing a considerable turbulence in the heat exchange zone, with the resultant reduction of the temperature difference between the heating surface and the frying oil, so as to avoid the degradation of the oil.This advantage is the more noticable, the greater the number of vanes on said shaft and the closer the vanes extend towards the container wall. On the other hand, to obtain the maximum advantage would require an extremely accurate and thus costly construction of the rotor, i.e.of the vaned shaft. In addition, a great number of vanes would induce the entire mass of the oil to rotate, whereby the pumping effect would be reduced, resulting in a reduced circulation and excessive agitation of the oil, with the consequent oxydation thereof due to the formation of air bubbles.A further object of the invention is thus the provision of a rotor of very simple construction and designed to be mounted and serviced in a simple manner while being capable of producing maximum turbulence in the flow of the frying oil preferentially or solely in the zone immediately adjacent the wall of the heating assembly.This object is attained according to the invention by a rotor having a central shaft carrying a plurality of radial vanes and characterized in that a plurality of rods extending substantially parallel to said shaft is connected to said shaft for rotation therewith adjacent the peripheral zone of said vanes in proximity to the heating wall.In practical experiments it has been found that the employ of the rotor according to the invention permits very low temperature differences to be achieved between the heating wall and the oil flowing through the heater assembly so as to reduce the degradation of the oil.These and other objects and advantages of the invention will become more clearly evident from the following description, given by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein fig. 1 shows a diagrammatic representation of a fryer according to a preferred embodiment of the invent ion, fig. 2 shows a diagrammatic representation of a fryer according to an alternative embodiment of the invention, fig. 3 shows a side view of a rotor employed in the fryer according to fig. 1 or fig. 2, and fig. 4 shows and end view of the rotor of fig. 3.A fryer shown in fig. 1 has a housing 5 containing a stainless steel vessel 6 for containign an oil bath 7 and formed with an expansion zone 8 adjacent the front side 9 of the fryer. The term expansion zone 8 denotes a part of the vessel destined to contain the foam formed during the frying process and extending from the level of oil bath 7 to an overflow level. The lower portion of vessel 6 is provided with a discharge conduit 10 and a filter 11 disposed on the inclined bottom of the vessel converging towards the opening of discharge conduit 10. Inserted into vessel 6 is a basket 12 for containing the food to be fried. A container 13 is mounted in the fryer adjacent the front side thereof, with its lower end in communication with discharge conduit 10 and its upper end connected to vessel 6 through a conduit 14.Container 13 is provided with elect ric resistance heaters 15 wound on its outer surface and secured thereto by welding or soldering, and contains a means for forcedly circulating the oil between container 13 and vessel 6. The forced circulation means comprises a vaned shaft 16 mounted coaxially in container 13 and having its lower end telescopingly engaged with an electric motor 17, while its upper end is rotatably but non slidably connected to a closure plug 18 of container 13.The length Y of the telescoping engagement of the lower end is smaller than the engagement length X of plug 18 in Container 13 so as to ensure the safety of the operator on disassembly of the fryer for cleaning and maintenance purposes. The rotor including shaft 16 may thus be extracted from container 13 by lifting Plug 18, the driving connection to motor 17 being released prior to the complete extraction of plug 18 from container 13 so as to exclude any danger to the operator. Motor 17 is disposed outside container 13. The shaft of motor 17 has to be provided with conventional sealing means for avoiding or at least controlling losses of the heated oil.Inserted in discharge conduit 10 downstream of container 13 is a normally closed discharge valve 19 permitting the oil to be discharged from vessel 6 and container 13 if so required for maintenance or repair of the fryer.The fryer according to the invention offers the following advantages with regard to efficiency and facility of oper ation The indirect heating of the oil in combinatoin with the forced circulation ensures a uniform temperature of the oil bath and reduces the danger of degradation of the oil, with the resultant advantages as regards the quality of the prepared foods. The arrangement of container 13 with the associated means for heating and forcedly circulating the oil at a forward location of the fryer and in outlet communication with the expansion zone, and the location of the motor below the container ensure optimum accessibility of the container and its connecting passages for cleaning and maintenacne purposes. The telescope type coupling of the elements of the forced circulation means permits the associated parts to be readily disassembled without any danger to the operator.The different lengths of the upper and lower mountings of shaft 16 are effective to ensure uncoupling of shaft 16 from Motor 17 prior to the extraction of the rotor from container 13.Fig. 2 shows an alternative embodiment of the fryer according to the invention. This embodiment differs from the one shown in fig. 1 mainly in that discharge conduit 10 is extended downwards in the front portion of the fryer In this case, oil heating container 13 is no longer directly inserted in discharge conduit 10, but connected thereto via a short inlet conduit 20. This embodiment further permits a receptacle 21 to be placed into the lower portion of housing 5 for collecting the oil discharged by opening valve 19. In comparison to the one shown in fig. 1, the fig. 2 embodiment has the slight disadvantage that inlet conduit 20 is not as readily accessible for cleaning and inspection.According to a further characteristic of the invention, shown in figs. 3 and 4, a rotor 25 is formed by shaft 16 having a plurality of radial vanes welded thereto. Vanes 27 are preferably of semicircular shape and arranged at inclined positions with respect to the axis of shaft 16.Otherwise vanes 27 are arranged in pairs opposite one an other and at equal spacings along the length of shaft 16.For proper operation of the rotor three pairs of vanes are sufficient, it being evident, however, that the number, the shape and the arrangement of the vanes may be adapted to the requirements of any given fryer and of the associated arrangement for heating and circulating the oil.According to a particularly simple and economical embodiment, a plurality of rods 28 is welded to the free ends of vanes 27 in spaced relation and substantially parallel to the axis of shaft 16. There are preferably four rods 28 located at diametrally opposite positions with respect to the axis of shaft 16.As an alternative, rods 28 may be directly connected to shaft 16 through radial links. In any case the rods have to be mounted for rotation together with the remainder of the rotor and should be disposed in the peripheral zone of the vanes as close as possible to the heating wall.Rotor 25 is obviously of very simple construction and designed for simple and efficient employ in an oil heating and circulating arrangement of the type described. In practical experiments it has been shown that in operation the rotor according to the invention exerts an effient pumping effect for the circulation of the oil between the heating arrangement and the vessel of the fryer. In addition, the rods 28 disposed peripherally of vanes 27 are effective to induce a violent turbulence in the oil flow adjacent the heat exchange wall of the heating container, while the overall turbulence of the oil flow remains relatively low. This arrangement minimizes the danger of oxydation of the oil due to the formation of air bubbles. In addition, the temperature difference j T between the heating wall and the oil is reduced to very low values in the order of 20 to 300C, so that the degradation of the oil, and thus the consumption thereof, is minimized.
