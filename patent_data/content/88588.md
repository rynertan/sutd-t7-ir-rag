# BALKING CLAMP POSITIVE DRIVE

## Abstract
A positive drive having a housing 10 retaining a pair of spaced drive clutches 54 and 56 used to lock axles 18 and 20 respectively to housing 10 for one to one rotation. The clutches move from the engaged to the disengaged mode via axial movement of drive couplings 30 and 32 which are forced to the respective engaged positions by a shaft 48 secured for rotation with the housing. The shaft acts on cams 38 and 40 on the drive couplings to cause rotational and axial movement of the couplings. Rotational movement of one drive coupling relative to the other drive coupling is prevented by a balking clamp 76 . The clutches 54 and 56 are inserted within the housing through a window 14 . The axles are retained by C clips 80 contacting spine couplings 26 and 28 .
