## Description
This invention relates to plasma display panels. Plasma display panels PDPs of X Y matrix type are known as a means for displaying characters or images. An X electrode group which comprises a data electrode may comprise anodes to which are applied high and low voltages corresponding to the display data i.e. data to be displayed . A Y electrode group which may be scanning electrodes may comprise cathodes which are scanned in a line sequential manner, a negative voltage pulse being applied. Japanese Patent disclosure number 56 128470 discloses a previously proposed plasma display panel having one or more trigger electrodes in addition to the X Y electrodes. The trigger electrodes are arranged in the vicinity of the cathodes and are separated from them by an insulating dielectric layer. When a high voltage is applied to the trigger electrodes in synchronism with cathode scanning, a trigger discharge, which acts as an inducing discharge, is generated between the trigger electrodes and the cathodes. The inducing discharge permits easy and rapid discharge between the anodes and cathodes so that a drive voltage can be decreased, variations among the discharge cells can be averaged and flickering can be reduced. The trigger electrodes may be divided into a plurality of phases, in which case the cathodes may be divided into groups associated with each trigger electrode phase. When scanning drivers for the cathodes are commonly used among the phases and phase sequential scanning of the trigger electrodes is associated therewith, the number of cathode scanning elements can be decreased to one number of phases . Such a system is referred to as a trigger matrix system since third matrix electrodes are added to the system. Such trigger matrix systems are subject to erroneous discharges due to the fact that differences in firing potential and discharge maintaining voltages among the discharge cells, which can be 10 volts or more, can cause misfiring. An erroneous discharge generated in one cell gives rise to a trigger effect which causes sequential generation of erroneous discharges in non selected cells of other phases. Also, there is a difference of about 10 volts between the discharge self maintaining voltages at two ends of the panel due to the resistance of the cathode lines. for this reason, there is a margin of variation in the power supply voltage for preventing erroneous discharges, which is as small as several volts, and stable operation of the display panel over a long period of time cannot easily be achieved. Since the potential of the trigger electrodes of the non selected inactive phases falls to a low voltage such as ground potential , and erroneous discharge may be generated between the surface of the trigger delectric layer of the region of a non selected phase and the anodes to which data voltages such as high voltage pulses are applied. Light emission due to the erroneous discharge is called rain discharge because it appears as a plurality of stripes along a number of anode lines in a vertical display direction. This causes considerable degradation in the display definition. Also, in such previously proposed display devices, the trigger system requires a large amount of power because the trigger electrodes are capacitive loads and are driven by high voltage and high frequency pulses. In other words, assuming for example that there are four hundred cathodes and a frame frequency of 60kHz, the frequency of the cathode scanning is about 24 kHz, which is about 40 microseconds line. Since a high voltage pulse of about 300 volts having the same frequency as that of the cathode scanning must be applied to the trigger electrodes, and since the trigger electrodes are capacitive loads as mentioned above, the trigger circuit requires several tens of watts of power. Since the trigger electrodes are mounted adjacent the cathodes with a very thin dielectric insulating layer separating them, the dielectric breakdown can easily occur. In a paper by Y Amano et al entitled A new dc PDP with low voltage drive and high resolution , published at pages 169 174 of Proceedings of the S.I.D. 23 1982 No. 3, Los Angeles, USA, there is described a plasma display panel comprising pairs of discharge electrodes arranged in an X Y matrix form in an envelope with discharge gaps between them at least one trigger electrode for inducing discharges, the trigger electrode being arranged adjacent at least one of the discharge electrodes and separated therefrom by an insulating layer and a trigger circuit connected to the trigger electrode and operative to produce at least one voltage waveform V According to the present invention, there is provided a plasma display panel comprising pairs of discharge electrodes arranged in an X Y matrix form in an envelope with discharge gaps between them at least one trigger electrode for inducing discharges, the trigger electrode being arranged adjacent at least one of the discharge electrodes and separated therefrom by an insulating layer and a trigger circuit connected to the trigger electrode and operative to produce at least one voltage waveform which varies as a function of time characterised in that the trigger circuit produces a voltage waveform which has a first voltage level during a first period of time which is sufficient to induce discharge, which is then switched to a substantially different second voltage for a second period of time which is shorter than said first period of time, the second voltage being insufficient to initiate an inducing discharge, and which is then returned to a third voltage between the levels of the first and second voltages. Preferred embodiments of the present invention described hereinbelow seek to solve the above mentioned problems by providing plasma display panels in which power consumption of the trigger electrode drive circuitry is decreased and erroneous discharge and dielectric breakdown is prevented so as to obtain a high definition display and stable operation over long periods of time. The invention will now be further described, by way of illustrative and non limiting example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figures 1 and 2 are, respectively, a schematic plan view end a partial sectional view of a plasma display panel PDP in which the present invention may be embodied. The plasma display panel includes a front glass panel 1, a rear glass panel 2, anodes 3 which may be data electrodes and cathodes 4 which may be scanning electrodes . The anodes 3 and cathodes 4 are sandwiched between the glass panels 1 and 2 with a suitable space and discharge gas therebetween and are arranged in an X Y matrix form to oppose each other with small discharge gaps between them. Trigger electrodes 6, which are divided into a plurality of phases for example eight phases in the particular example illustrated are arranged under and along and parallel to the cathodes 4. An insulating or dielectric layer 5 is disposed between the trigger electrodes 6 and the cathodes 4. Alternative anodes 3 are connected to an upper anode driver or drive circuit 7A and the other alternate anodes 3 are connected to a lower anode driver or drive circuit 7B. A high level state voltage for example 1 or a low level data voltage 0 corresponding to display data i.e. data to be displayed is supplied to the anodes 3 in synchronism with cathode scanning by a shift register with parallel outputs and switching output elements of the drivers 7A and 7B acccording to a serial display data input. A negative voltage is supplied to the cathodes 4 by a cathode scanning circuit 8 from the upper edge to the lower edge in a line sequential fashion. A discharge is generated between a selected cathode 4 and an anode 3 to which a high voltage is applied. The trigger electrodes 6 are driven by a trigger circuit 9. In a previously proposed triggering method illustrated by the waveforms of Figures 3A to 3E, a trigger voltage V This method of triggering requires a large amount of power and a bulky power supply. When the trigger voltage V It can be assumed that, since the recovery discharge serves mainly to prepare the circuit for the generation of succeeding trigger discharges, it need not be generated for each cathode line. In one activated phase of a trigger electrode covering several or several tens of cathode lines, the recovery discharge can be generated once in the trigger electrode after generating trigger discharges corresponding to the number of cathodes. This is sufficient for the recovery function. For this purpose, a triggering method illustrated in the waveform chart of Figures 4A to 4G is proposed. As shown in Figure 4B, which represents the waveform of the trigger voltage V During the triggering or trigger interval, when a positive data voltage pulse illustrated in Figure 4A is applied to the anode 3, discharge emission is caused between the cathode 4 of the triggered cell and the anode. It is to be noted that Figure 4B shows a pre charge interval prior to the triggering interval, the pre charge interval being a charging interval of a pre charge capacitor for producing the trigger voltage V Using this method, which is called a batched or block trigger or triggering method, since the frequency of the trigger pulses is decreased considerably the power consumption will be reduced greatly. For example, if the capacitance of one trigger electrode 6 is C However, in the batched or block trigger method, since the voltage difference Figures 4A and 4B between the anode 3 to which the data voltage is applied and the trigger electrode 6 at the low level V During the trigger interval, a voltage difference V An embodiment of the present invention can solve this problem by utilising a trigger voltage having a waveform illustrated in Figure 5. After the recovery discharge R An up magnitude V In practice, as illustrated in Figure 5, the voltage V The surface of the insulating layer 5 is positively charged by the recovery discharge and the potential of the trigger electrode 6 of the inactive phase is stepped up during the following inactive interval. For this reason, a positive electric field is generated along the surface of the insulating layer 5. Such electric field, which is formed in the inactive region, prevents diffusion of plasma ions generated by main discharges of displays occurring in the adjacent activated trigger electrode region of the active phase. For this reason, erroneous discharges at the inactive discharge cells, which might be triggered by ions diffusing into the inactive phase, will be prevented. Also, in the block trigger method illustrated in Figures 4A to 4G, a voltage of 2V Figure 6 is a schematic diagram of a power supply for a plasma display panel in accordance with this embodiment of this invention. An anode drive voltage source V The trigger voltage V As is illustrated in Figure 7, the trigger circuit 9 comprises two pairs of serial switches SW1, SW2 and SW3 and SW4 which are connected between a power supply line V The circuit of Figure 7 operates in the following manner. The switches SW2 and SW3 are turned on, with the other switches turned off, and the capacitor C The trigger waveform of the other phase phase A is reversed with respect to that of phase B and is illustrated in Figure 8A. Using refresh timing, even when the switch SW1 is turned on, since the other switches SW2 to SW4 are off the accumulated charge in the pre charge capacitor CP will not be discharged. Therefore, the amount of power consumed by the pre charge capacitor C Figure 9 is a detailed circuit diagram of a practical form of circuit embodiment corresponding to the circuit shown in principle in Figure 7. Transistors Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4 respectively correspond to the switches SW1, SW2, SW3 and SW4. Diodes D1 and D2 act as protective diodes. Since the transistors Q2 and Q3 are turned on at the same time for pre charging, an ON signal S1 to the transistor Q3 is supplied to the transistor Q2 through a level shift transistor Q5. During the trigger interval the transistor Q4 is turned on in response to a signal S2 supplied through a level shift transistor Q6 and the voltage V Desired and preferred voltage waveforms and the timing of the trigger voltage will now be described. Figures 10A to 10C illustrate a trigger voltage waveform V The trigger voltage for the selected active phase must rise before starting of the cathode selection or scanning. Thus, the trigger voltage presumably reaches a high level within about 2H, where H is an interval of about 40 microseconds and represents a scanning interval of the cathode line, so as to start rising from about 3H before every phase switching time. The rise time can be adjusted by adjusting the resistance R8 of the emitter electrode of the transistor Q4 shown in Figure 9. Figures 11A to 11C illustrate the voltage waveform V Figures 12A to 12C illustrate the voltage waveform and the trigger discharge when the return speed for returning the trigger voltage V As can be seen from the waveform charts shown in Figures 12A to 12C, the return speed does not influence the trigger discharge V Figures 13A to 13C illustrate waveform charts for the trigger discharge when the cathode bias voltage V Figures 14A to 14C illustrate waveform charts of the trigger discharge when the anode bias voltage V It should be noted that an increase in the anode off potential V Figure 15 is a graph showing the relationship between the necessary minimum value p p value of the trigger voltage V As described above, the rising time of the beginning of the trigger interval is set to be lower and the falling time at the end thereof is set to be higher. Furthermore, the cathode and anode biases are set to be higher, thus providing satisfactory operation. As shown in Figure 8A in the trigger drive waveform of this embodiment, the rise and fall times are set to be about 3H and about 1H, respectively, where H is about 40 microseconds. Figure 16 is a graph in which the batched or block trigger method is represented by the trigger waveform V In terms of a voltage region of V An example in which the refresh trigger method is applied to a trigger matrix drive, which is a method for commonly using a cathode drive means among a plurality of trigger phases, will next be described. As described above, in the refresh trigger method the trigger electrode 6 in the active phase generates the leading discharge D Figure 17 illustrates a trigger matrix drive circuit which can solve this problem. The circuit comprises four phase triggers T1 to T4 each having four cathodes. The trigger electrodes 6 of each phase are driven in a phase sequential manner as indicated by T1 to T4 in Figures 18A to 18D. The cathodes 4 located at boundary portions of the trigger electrodes 6 are not commonly driven together with those in the adjacent phases, but are independently and selectively driven by an addressable driver 20 at a predetermined timing as indicated by waveforms KA1, KA4, KA5 and KA8 illustrated in Figures 18G to 18J, respectively. In the middle portion of each trigger phase, since these cathodes are not selected in an overlapping manner by sequential triggering, the cathode lines are commonly connected among four phases and, as indicated by waveforms KM2 and KM3 of Figures 18E and 18F, they are commonly driven by a matrix driver 21 over four phases. Figure 19 shows another drive circuit. This circuit also comprises a four phase trigger in which each phase has four cathodes. As described previously, the overlapping selection of the cathodes associated with the leading and recovery discharges occurs between each two adjacent trigger phases. For this reason, in this embodiment, the cathodes in every other trigger phase are commonly driven. As shown in Figure 19, a first line of a first phase and that of a third phase are commonly driven and a first line of a second phase and that of a fourth phase are commonly driven. The four phase trigger electrodes are selected and are triggered in a phase sequential manner as indicated by waveforms T1 to T4 of Figures 20A to 20D. The corresponding cathodes in every other phase are sequentially and commonly driven by a matrix driver 22 by waveforms KM1 to KM8 illustrated in Figures 20E to 20H. It is to be noted that, in the above embodiments, the anodes 3 and the cathodes 4 correspond to data and scanning electrodes, respectively. However, instead, the display data can be supplied to the cathodes and the anodes can be scanned in a line sequential manner. In this case, the trigger electrodes are arranged along the anodes 3 and a group of a plurality of anodes is covered by one phase of the trigger electrodes. Furthermore, in the above embodiments, the trigger electrodes are divided into two or four phases so as to perform time divisional drive. However, it is possible for a single phase drive to be performed without time division. In this case, in order to hold intervals for the leading and recovery discharges at the start and end of each trigger interval, a blanking period may be provided for each frame. In summary of the foregoing disclosure, there is provided a plasma display panel having cathodes 4, anodes 3 and trigger electrodes 6 wherein the trigger electrodes correspond to a plurality of discharge electrodes e.g. the cathodes 4 which are scanned sequentially. An insulating layer 5 separates the trigger electrodes 6 and the discharge electrodes and a constant trigger voltage is supplied until the plurality of discharge electrodes corresponding to the trigger electrode have been activated. The trigger voltage is quickly changed and is then returned to an intermediate level V Although the invention has been described above by way of example with respect to methods or techniques of applying voltages to trigger electrodes of a display panel, it is more generally applicable to applying voltages to various electrodes.
