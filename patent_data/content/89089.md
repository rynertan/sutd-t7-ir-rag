## Description
Phenyl piperazine derivatives having antiaggressive activity. The invention relates to new phenyl piperazine derivatives, to the preparation of these compounds and to compositions comprising at least one of these compounds as the active substance. Various phenyl piperazine derivatives with or without pharmacological properties are known. The preparation of five compounds of formula 1 of the formula sheet, wherein R is the phenyl, p chlorophenyl , p fluorophenyl , p methoxyphenyl or 3,5 dimethoxyphenyl group is known from Indian. J. Appl. Chem. 1972 , 35, pp. 129 130 which article is referred to in Chem. Abstr. 81, 120577 n . These compounds have been prepared in the framework of an investigation into new anthelmintics. Furthermore, an article in J. Med. Chem. 9 1966 pp. 153 155 relates to compounds of formula 2, wherein R1 may be the phenyl group or 4 chlorophenyl group, R2 is, for example, hydrogen, methyl, ethyl, propyl, tert. butyl, phenyl or substituted phenyl and n is 1 or 2. The compounds have been tested for various activities and in most of the cases proved to have no activity. It has now been found that phenylpiperazine derivatives of formula 3 of the formula sheet, wherein R3 is a trifluoromethyl group or a chlorine atom, R4 is a hydrogen atom, methyl group or ethyl group, A is the group CH2 , CH2CH2 , EMI1.1 X is the groupEMI1.2 or when A comprises more than one C atom,X cannot be CH2 Y is the groupEMI1.3 with the proviso that, when X is the group CH2 , Y is the groupEMI1.4 and thatX cannot be equal to Y Z is the group NR5R6, wherein P5 and R6 are hydrogen or an alkyl group having 1 4 C atoms, or Z is an alkyl group having 1 4 0 atoms, the cyclohexyl group, cyclohexylmethyl group, cyclohexyloxymethyl group or one of the groups of formulae 4 10, wherein R7 is hydrogen, 4 fluoro, 4 chloro, 4 methyl, 4 methoxy, 3 trifluoromethyl, 4 trifluoromethyl, 2,6 difluoro, 2,6 dichloro and m is an integer having the value 2 5, or Z is a group R80 wehrein R8 is an alkyl group or cycloalkyl group having 1 6 C atoms or an aralkyl radical the aryl group of which may be substituted by a group R7, and the salts thereof, have a strong antiaggressive activity. Moreover, some compounds belonging to this group are readily analgetically active. The antiaggressive activity of the compounds was measured in a test suitable for that purpose in isolated mice Advances in Pharmacol. 5 1967 , 79 . In this test, male albino mice were kept isolated for a period of 4 weeks and were then selected for the test on the basis of fighting behaviour present. The selection criterion is the occurrence of 3 or more fighting periods within 3 minutes after a mouse which has not been kept isolated has been placed in the cage of the mouse which has been kept isolated. The compounds to be investigated were administered orally to the selected mice. 5 Mice were used per dosis. Sixty minutes after administration of the compounds to be examined, the animals wre again evaluated for fighting behaviour. The compound to be investigated is inactive in the administered dos is when this time also 3 or more fighting periods were observed within 3 minutes after a mouse which has not been kept isolated was placed with the mouse which had been kept isolated.The ED50 value in mg of active substance per kg of body weight was calculated from the results obtained. The compounds according to the invention have an ED50 value which is smaller than 10 mg kg and for most compounds the ED50 value is 1 5 mg kg. Due to the strong antiaggressive activity and the absence of undesired side effects, for example sympatholytic, dopaminolytic. muscle relaxing and sedative properties, the compounds are exfellently suitable for use in the treatment of intraand extrapuni.ive behaviour and overt aggressive behaviour in man and anima For medical use in men is to be considered first of all the coittrol of aggressive symptoms in psychiatric symptoms of a disease tnd serious forms of psychopathological aggression. As a possibility of application in the veterinary field are to le considered above all those forms of aggression which occur in transporting agricultural domestic animals and the mixing of groups of these animals. The quantity, frequence and mode of administration may differ for each individual case, also dependent on the nature and the severity of the disturbances. Generally, a dose from 5 to 500 mg and preferably from 25 to 150 mg daily will be suitable for humane application. For veterinary applications the dose is preferably from 0.1 to 10 mg kg of body weight. The active compounds according to the invention and their salts can be processed according to known standard methods to compositions such as pills, tablets, coated tablets, capsules, powders, injection liquids and the like while using the conventioral auxiliary substances such as solid and liquid carrier materials. As examples of pharmaceutically acceptable acids with which thc compounds according to the invention can form salts may be rentioned hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid, nitric acid, citric acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, tartaric acid, methanesulphoiic acid, benzoic acid and the like The compounds of formula 3 and their salts can be prepared according to methods which are suitable for the synthesis of analogous compounds Therefore the invention also relatesto the preparation of the new compounds and the salts thereof. The compounds of formula 3 can be obtained, for example, by reaction of a compound of the general formula 11 of the formula sheet with a compound of the formula Cl A X NR4 Y Z, wherein R3, R4, A,X,Y and Z have the above meanings. This reaction is preferably carried out in an inert solvent, for example ethanol or acetonitrile at a temperature between 200C and the boilir,, point of the solvent used, in the presence of an acid binder. Compounds of formula 3 can also be obtained by reacting a confound of formula 12 with a compound of the formulaZ Y Cl, in which formulae the symbols have the above meanings. Furthermore, compounds of formula 3 can be obtained by reaction of a compound of formula 13 with a compound of the formula HNR5R6 or R80H, wherein the symbols have the above meanings. This reaction is preferably carried out in an organic solvent, for example, ether, tetrahydrofuran, benzene, toluene or methylene chloride, at a temperature between OOC and the boiling point of the solvent used. The compounds of formula 3 can furthermore be obtained by reaction of a compound of formula 14 with a compound of the formula NH2 A X NR4 Y Z. This conversion is preferably carried out in a solvent, for example butanol, in the presence of an acid binder, for example K2C03, at temperatures between room temperature and the boiling point of the solvent In similar cirucumstances the compounds of formula 3 can be obtained by reaction of a compound of formula 15 with a compound of formula 16. Finally, compounds of formula 3 can be obtained by reaction of a compound of formula 17 or an acid addition salt thereof, with a compound of the formula Z Y NHR4.
