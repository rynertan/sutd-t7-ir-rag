# FUEL MIXING DEVICE

## Abstract
A fuel mixing device for an internal combustion engine which includes a fuel atomization chamber 12 , a rotatable atomization drum 22 disposed within the fuel atomization chamber 12 and which is adapted for rotation about its axis, the atomization drum 22 having a side wall 24 comprised of a porous, mesh like material which, during rotation of the drum 22 , passes through a level of fuel maintained within the atomization chamber 12 so that the atomized air passes through the side wall 24 to produce the airfuel mixture.
