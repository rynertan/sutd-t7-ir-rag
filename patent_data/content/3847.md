## Description
Biphenylylglycine Derivatives and their Salts with BasesPriority February 27, 1978, Japan, No. 20906 78This invention relates to,biphenylylglycine derivatives of the general formula IEMI1.1 wherein R1 is an amino group or a protected amino group and their salts with bases.The term protected amino group used herein refers to an amino group, at least one hydrogen atom of which is substi tuted by a group capable of being easily split off, or an amino group to which a group is added which is capable of being easily split off. This includes an amino group protected by any group which is usually used as a so called protecting group in the field of amino acid or peptide synthesis.Examples of the groups which can be used in this invention are substituted or unsubstituted benzyiiaene groups, substituted alkyl or alkenyl groups such as the triphenylmethyl group or 1 methoxycarbonyl 1 propene 2 yl group mercapto groups such as the 2 nitrophenylmercapto group organic or inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid or benzene sulfonic acid acyl groups of the general formulaII CO R2 11 wherein R2 is a hydrogen atom a substituted or unsubstituted lower alkyl group, for example, methyl, ethyl, pro pyl, n butyl, iso butyl, tert. butyl, trifluoromethyl or 2,2,2 trihaloethyl an aralkyl group, for example, benzyl or oc phenethyl or an aryl group, for example, phenyl or naphthyl.Said aralkyl group or aryl group may be substituted by one or more groups selected from halogen atoms, a hydroxyl group, a lower alkyl group, a lower alkoxy group or a nitro group or a group represented by the general formula III CO Y R3 III wherein Y is an oxygen atom, a sulfur atom or an imino group, R3 is a lower alkyl group, for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl, n butyl, iso butyl, tert. butyl or a halogen substituted lower alkyl group such as 2,2,2 trihaloethyl an aralkyl group, for example, benzyl or 6 phenethyl an aryl group, for example, phenyl or naphthyl, said aralkyl or aryl group which can be sub stituted by one or more groups selected Wu the c,tou . consisting of a halogen atom, a hydroxyl group, a lower alkyl group, a lower alkoxyl group and a nitro group adaantyl group or a hydrogen atom when Y is an imino group , among which a group represented by the general formula IV CO O R4 Iv wherein R4 is a lower alkyl group, for example, tert.butyl a lower halo alkyl group, for example, 2,2,2 trihaloethyl a substituted or unsubstituted benzyl group, for example, 4 methoxy benzyl or benzyl or an adamant group is preferred.The term Ã…a lower alkyl group or a lower alkoxy group means a group containing 1 to 5 carbon atoms, preferably 1 or 2 carbon atoms.The salts of biphenylylglycine derivatives represented by the general formula I include salts with an alkali metal such as sodium or potassium an alkaline earth metal such as calcium or barium and an organic base, for example, tertiary amines such as triethylamine, Nmethylpiperidine and pyridine.The biphenylylglycine derivatives of the general formula I contain an asymmetric carbon atom at the position to the carboxy group. Therefore, the compounds can exist as optical isomers, namely D and L isomers. All such isomers and the racemic mixtures are included in this invention.The compounds of the general formula I are prepared,for example, by the following method. An N protected hydroxyglycine is reacted with o,o o,o di hydroxybiphenyl in the presence of an acid catalyst in an inert organic solvent. Examples of the acid catalyst which are useful in this reaction are Lewis acids such as boron trifluoride ethyl etherate and aluminium chloride mineral acids such as sulphuric acid and organic acids such as formic acid and trifluoroacetic acid.The inert organic solvents which may be used in the reaction include acetic acid, ethyl acetate, dioxane and tetrahydrofuran.The reaction proceeds at room temperature, but may be controlled by elevating or lowering the reaction temperature, if desired. The isolation of the product from the reaction mixture may be effected by any conventional technique such as extraction with ethyl acetate.The compounds of the general formula I wherein R1 is an amino group can be formed by removing the protecting group from the N protected biphenylylglycine which has been prepared by the above method. The removal of the protecting group may be accomplished by conventional techniques, depending on the particular protecting group. Conventional techniques include, for example, reduction, treatment with a strong organic acid such as trifluoroacetic acid, formic acid, etc..The product is obtained as a racemic mixture and, if dew sired, it can be subjected to resolution to isolate an optically active compound enantiomer . The resolution can be accomplished by any suitable conventional technique. An example of such a technique comprises forming a salt of the product with an optically active base such as brucine, strychnine, ephedrine, quinine or similar and then fractionally crystallizing the resulting diastereomeric salt. In certain cases resolution can be effected by using an optically active acid such as malic acid, tartaric acid or similar, after esterifying the carboxyl group of the product.Furthermore, the optically active compounds may be isolated from the racemic mixture by utilizing an asymmetric inductive effect. That is, the resolution can be accomplished by bonding an optically active group as a protecting group, e.g. an g phenylethyloxycarbonyl group, to the amino group of the objective compound in the form of a racemic mixture and by fractionally crystallizing the protected compound.The compounds of the general formula I or their salts prepared in the manner described above are useful as intermediates for synthesizing various penicillin derivatives and cephalosporin derivatives which have excellent antibacterial activities. For example, 7B bL tL amino a 3 2 hydroxyphenyl 4 hydroxyphenylJacetamidov desacetoxycephalosporin which has strong antibacterial activities against both gram positive and gram negative bacteria is prepared from one of the object compounds of this invention, DL X f3 2 hydroxyphenyl 4 hydroxy phenyl glycine and 7 aminodesacetoxy cephalosporanic acid.
