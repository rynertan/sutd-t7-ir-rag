# Remote speed controller for a motor.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a remote speed controller for an electric motor. The controller comprises a switching unit having three switches SW1, SW2, SW3 . A capacitor pack 2 incorporating two capacitors C1, C2 is connected to the switching unit such that different combinations of the capacitors can be selected by the switch SW3 . The controller is connected in circuit between an AC voltage supply and windings of a motor so that selective actuation of the switch SW3 changes the speed of the motor in accordance with the values of the capacitors selected. The further switches SW1, SW2 are incorporated to provide reverse motor capability and remote sensor capability.
