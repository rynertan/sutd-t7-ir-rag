# Graft copolymers.

## Abstract
Macromonomers are obtained by successively reacting an oligomer or polymer containing at least one hydroxyl group with a cyciic carboxylic anhydride in an amount of at least one mole of the anhydride per hydroxyl group, and reacting the product with a compound containing a single epoxide group and a single polymerisable double bond, in such proportions as to esterify all carboxyl groups in that product. Graft copolymers which are useful as steric stabili sers for dispersions of polymer particles can be made by copolymerising the macromonomers with other poly merisable monomers.
