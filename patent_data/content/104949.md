# Method and article for sealing a substrate using a recoverable sleeve.

## Abstract
Pipes and other substrates exposed to or submerged in water can be protected by coating them with a corrosion protection sealing material and subjecting the material during or after it has been applied to the substate to pressure applied progressively. The pressure is provided by progressive recovery of a sleeve as it is released from a holdout which holds it in a recoverable configuration. The progressive recovery can be, for example, from one end of the sleeve to the other or from the center of the sleeve outwards to each end. The progressive shrinkage can be achieved, for example, by use of an external holdout which releases an inner expanded sleeve when contacted with solvent around the circumference of the sleeve commencing at one end of the sleeve and continuing along the sleeve to the other end.

## Description
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a method and article for delivering a sealing material to a substrate in such a manner that the material is delivered in a progressive fashion to the substrate. It is known in the art to apply certain corrosion protection materials to a substrate to protect it from its surrounding environment. For example, oil pipelines are typically coated with a polymeric layer such as an epoxy resin. The polymeric layer can be applied as a coating composition or as a polymeric article such as a sleeve or tape which is secured to the surface of the substrate by means of an adhesive. Conventional coating techniques work well when the substrate is located above ground or the substrate is coated above ground and subsequently buried in the ground or submerged in water. Special problems are encountered when the substrate to be coated is in an environment in which it is continually wetted, for example, in the splash zone of off shore oil rigs, pier pilings, on barges and the like. Such substrates are usually, but not always, coated with a protective coating before installation. Such coatings may become damaged during use, permitting water to penetrate to the underlying substrate causing corrosion. It is therefore desirable to be able to coat substrates, for example, in the splash zone of oil rigs, in their environment with a protective coating in the event the preinstallation coating is damaged or no such coating has been applied and corrosion protection is now desired. The application of a curable coating composition to a substrate submerged in water or in the splash zone is discussed in U.S. Patents Nos. 3,160,518 to Jorda, 3,639,344 to Kinneman and 4,022,946 to Cummings. The coating composition can be applied by various techniques such as by means of a trowel or the like. However it is difficult to apply the coating to the wetted surface of the substrate such that it will adhere to the surface forming a pin hole free coating and without trapping water between the coating and the substrate. This invention provides an improved method of providing such a coating. A sealing material is applied to or forced against the surface of the substrate in a progressive, and preferably continuous, manner thereby displacing water from the surface of the substrate resulting in little, if any, water trapped between the coating and the substrate. The progressive manner of application of the sealing material exerts pressure against the substrate during and after the coating step resulting in superior adhesion of the coating to the substrate. This invention provides a method of delivering a sealing material to a substrate wetted with water, which comprises a positioning the sealing material adjacent the substrate b positioning concentrically with respect to the substrate and facing the sealing material, a sleeve maintained in a recoverble configuration by a restraining member bonded to the sleeve by a water sensitive adhesive and c contacting the water sensitive adhesive with water causing the bond to fail and the sleeve to recover progressively towards the substrate thereby applying pressure to the sealing material causing it to displace water from the substrate. The invention also provides an article capable of delivering a sealing material to a substrate wetted with water, which comprises a a sleeve and b a restraining member bonded to the sleeve by a water sensitive adhesive, thereby maintaining the sleeve in a recoverable configuration such that when the adhesive is contacted with water the bond fails causing the sleeve to recover progressively towards the substrate thereby applying pressure to the sealing material placed adjacent the substrate causing it to displace water from the substrate. The invention is particularly applicable to corrosion protection of substances which are continuously or intermittently wet with water, and cannot be removed to a dry place for installation of the sleeve. This is because the sleeve of the invention can displace water already present. The water applied to the sleeve in the method of the invention will generally be indiscriminate or bulk application such as by immersion or wave spraying and the like. In particular the invention is applicable to corrosion protection of marine structures such as supports and pipes etc in the splash zones of oil rigs. The corrosion protection composition can be a curing or non curing coating composition. It is preferred to use a curing composition applied in its curable, i.e. non cured state. The curable composition may be a two part resin system comprising a prepolymer and a curing initiator. Typical compositions that may be used are epoxy resins with an amine hardener, for example compositions disclosed in above mentioned U.S.Patent Nos. 3,160,518, 3,639,344 and 4,022,946, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.Curable systems that may be used are thus known in the art. Several compositions of this type are commercially available. Alternatively, a one part sealing material may be used, for example, a moisture curing polysulfide based mastic formulation. Such a formulation may be modified with appropriate wetting agents which wet in the presence of water, and allow an adherent film to cure when contacted with moisture. A typical formulation of this type comprises about 80 of a polysulfide mastic and about 20 of a fatty acid modified wetting agent. The sealing material preferably has a viscosity at 20eC of about 100 to about 100000 poise and preferably is applied in an amount to provide a coating of from about 1.25 x 10 4 to about 1.25 x 10 2 m 5 to 500 mils in thickness on the substrate. The sealing material is interposed between the sleeve and the substrate, and is preferably applied to an inner surface of the sleeve, as discussed in more detail below, or applied directly onto the substrate by any technique after which the sleeve is recovered in a progressive manner over the resulting coating before it is permitted to cure significantly. The resulting coating adheres strongly to the substrate. The corrosion protection sealing material is applied to or forced against the surface in a progressive fashion, under pressure of the sleeve. This can result in superior corrosion prevention of the substrate as water, air and the like can be displaced from the surface by the sealing material the sealing material can be squeezed, or extruded onto or against the substrate, such that it forms a superior adherent film and the recovered sleeve can remain over the sealing material and protect it from water and mechanical damage. The corrosion protection sealing material is applied in accordance with this invention by means of a progressive recovery, preferably a progressive shrinkage, of a sleeve held in its recoverable configuration by a restraining member. Where the sleeve is shrinkable, the restraining member will in general be bonded to an external surface of the sleeve. The sleeve is preferably an elastomer such as a stretchable rubber which can accommodate expansion of from about 20 up to about 500 or higher, and which does not lose its ability to recover, when stored for a suitable length of time, such as one year. Preferred elastomers are neoprene and ethylene propylenediene terpolymer elastomers. The elastomer may be formulated, or treated after formulation, to ensure good adhesion to the, preferably external, restraining member or to the adhesive composition used to adhere the stretched or otherwise deformed sleeve to the restraining member. For example, the inclusion of chloroprene units in neoprene and or treatment with sulfuric acid or nitric acid for from 15 seconds to 30 minutes can result in improved properties.Also, surface treatment such as, flame treatment, plasma treatment, abrasion, solvent washing, and the like can enhance the properties of the sleeve. The external restraining member holds the stretched sleeve in its stretched configuration until release of the sleeve is triggered. In accordance with this invention, when release of the elastomeric sleeve is triggered the sleeve recovers in a progressive and preferably controlled manner so as to force the adhesive against the substrate in a progressive manner. The release may be, for example, from one end of the sleeve to the other or from the center region of the sleeve to each end. Various techniques may be used to achieve the progressive release of the sleeve. Water may be applied from one end of the restraining member to the other in a progressive fashion. Another way of achieving this is to apply water indiscriminately along the length of the sleeve and rely on a characteristic of the sleeve to ensure progressive recovery.For example, the restraining member may be provided with varying sized perforations or apertures so that water is conducted to the interface between the sleeve and the restraining member in the desired pattern. Alternatively, or in addition, the restraining member may be water soluble to provide the desired progressive recovery. As a further possibility, the thickness of the restraining member may vary along the length of the sleeve so that uniform application of solvent, or immersion in the solvent, results in the desired progressive recovery. Another way of achieving this is to mash portions of the adhesive in an appropriate pattern to provide access to the adhesive by the solvent as desired to produce the progressive shrink effect.The restraining member may be peeled from the sleeve after initial water induced release, particularly by peeling in circumferential strips starting at one end and continuing strip by strip along the sleeve. The external restraining member may be bonded directly to the sleeve, or an intermediate adhesive layer can be used to provide adequate adhesion between the restraining member and the sleeve. The restraining member should have sufficient strength and sufficient adhesive strength using an intermediate adhesive layer if necessary to hold the sleeve in its recoverable configuration for a useful shelf life, typically from one month to at least a year. In general, this means that the restraining member should have sufficient strength and sufficient adhesive strength to hold out an elastomer under 100 strain for the desired period of time, where the elastomer has a modulus at 100 strain of about 0.68 68 bar 10 1000 psi , preferably of about 6.8 20.4 bar 100 300 psi .Materials that may be used for the restraining member include polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride,polyethylene oxide, polyvinyl alcohol, ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers, wood, cardboard, metal sheet, metal mesh, and paper. In a two member laminate system, the restraining member used is water sensitive and adheres directly to the sleeve. In a three member laminate system the restraining member is generally not water sensitive and is used together with a water sensitive adhesive layer.Water sensitive, preferably water soluble, polymers are generally used as the base material for this adhesive.Water need not necessarily dissolve the bond between theSleeve and the restraining member all that is necessary is that water must cause the bond to fail under conditions prevailing in the field. Since many such water sensitive polymers are brittle at room temperature or otherwise difficult to process thermo plastically, they can be modified, for example, by the addition of an elastomer. The water soluble polymer should be one which has sufficient adhesive strength to bond the expanded elastomer sleeve to the restraining member. Preferably, this adhesive strength is from about 0.54 to about 3.6 kg per cm width 3 to 20 pounds per inch width . If the adhesive is to be used as the restraining member itself, the water soluble polymer also should possess sufficient structural integrity to not only bond to the sleeve but also to retain it in its expanded or stretched configuration.Typical water soluble polymers which can be used include natural and synthetic polymers, for example water soluble acrylamide polymers, acrylic acid polymers, methacrylic acid polymers, polyethylene oxide, polysaccharides, alkyl celluloses such as methyl or ethylcellulose, polyethylene glycols, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinylpyrrolidone, cyanamers, modified polyethylenes and the like, as well as blends thereof. Particularly preferred are polyethylene oxide, polyvinyl pyrrolidone and polyvinyl alcohol. The adhesive preferably has an ultimate room temperature elongation of from about 3 to 500 , preferably from about 10 to 100 and most preferably from about 15 to 150 . In addition, we prefer that the adhesive is sufficiently flexible that it possesses a SecantModulus at 2 strain, measured by ASTM D638, of greater than 6.8 x 104 bar 100,000 psi , more preferably 9.5 x bar to 1.7 x 105 bar 140000 to 250000 psi and most preferably 1.3 x 105 to 1.5 x 105 bar 190000 to 220000 psi . The adhesive desirably comprises from about 70 to about 95 , preferably from about 75 to about 82 , of a water soluble polymer and correspondingly from about 30 to about 5 , and preferably from about 18 to about 25 of an elastomer. The elastomer is preferably employed in an uncured state. Elastomers which can be used include natural rubber, ethylene propylene copolymer rubbers, ethylene propylene diene terpolymers, polychloroprenes, styrene butediene copolymer rubber, butyl rubber, polyisobutylene, polybutadiene, epichlorohydrin polymers, elastomeric copolymers of ethylene and acrylic acid, polyurethane, and the like, as well as blends thereof. Preferred elastomers include polychloroprene, styrenebutadiene copolymer rubbers, and polyisobutylene.The particular elastomer used in a given formulation depends to a certain extent on the water soluble polymer used. One skilled in the art with this teaching before him can readily ascertain, without undue experimentation, the appropriate elastomer and amount thereof to use with a particular water soluble polymer to achieve the desired result. In addition to the above elastomers mannitol or other sugars may be used to plasticize the water soluble polymer without loss of adequate adhesion. Other additives can, be incorporated into the adhesive, for example, dopants, conventional stabilizers, antioxidants, pesticides, such as fungicides and the like, tackifiers, acid scavengers, and the like. The adhesive may be prepared by blending the water soluble polymer and elastomer in conventional compounding and melt processing equipment, such as a two roll mill, intensive internal mixer, Banbury mixer, single or twin screw compounding extruder and the like. As mentioned above, these adhesives are particularly suitable for use in bonding an expanded elastomeric sleeve to a separate restraining member. In some embodiments, however, the adhesive itself functions as the restraining member, as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,135,553 to Evans et al. Several compositions comprising a water soluble polymer and an elastomer were prepared and tested. In each composition polyvinyl alcohol was used as the water soluble polymer in an amount of 80 parts by weight. Twenty 20 parts of an elastomer were blended with the water soluble polymer. The compositions were compounded on a two roll mill at 2050C 4000F .

The sample was manually bent around a 0.635 cm 0.250 inch mandrel at room temperature and visually inspected for cracks. If any cracks were noted the sample failed the test. If none was visible, the sample passed the test. b Secant Modulus The modulus of each sample under a strain of 2 was measured using the tension test as outlined inASTM D638.Compatibility The compatibility of the components of the composition was rated visually. Adhesive Peel Strength Samples were prepared by laminating 0.508 cm 0.020 inch of adhesive between two sheets of Neoprene at a temperature of 200it 390 F and a pressure of less than 0.68 bar 10 psi . A sample 2.5 cm 1 inch wide was cut from the laminate. Each end of the sample was clamped in the jaws of a tensile testing machine and pulled apart at a rate of 5cm 2 inches per minute. The force required to separate the Neoprene sheets from the adhesive composition was measured. This test is a variation of ASTM D1000 Method A.j Neoprene sheets were used in place of steel plates and the angle of peel was 90 instead of 180o. Ultimate Tensile Strength and Elongation The test procedure of ASTM D638, was used to determine the ultimate tensile strength and elongation. Results of the tests are shown in Table I.
