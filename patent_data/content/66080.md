# Single crystal lanthanum hexaboride cathode for thermionic emission of an electron beam having high brightness.

## Abstract
Electron beam emission apparatus useful for example in scanning electron microscopes or electron beam lithography comprises a lanthanum hexaboride LaBâ‚† single crystal cathode formed from a rod whose axis is parallel to a 100 crystallographic axis. The rod tip is formed with four flat surfaces oblique to the rod axis, each exposing a 110 crystal plane, so that the tip is pyramidal. These 110 crystal planes have low work functions and enhance beam brightness. Other pyramidal, part pyramidal or truncated pyramidal apex configurations are possible.
