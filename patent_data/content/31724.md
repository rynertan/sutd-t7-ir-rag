# Reinforced membranes, process and apparatus for making them, and use thereof as ion exchange membranes in chlor alkali cells or as catalysts.

## Abstract
Reinforced membranes comprise at least two layers of melt fabricable fluorinated polymer having side chains containing sulfonyl and or carboxyl groups in melt fabricable form, and a woven reinforcing fabric comprising warp and weft strands, there being at least one layer of said fluorinated polymer on each side of said reinforcing fabric, the warp and weft strands of said reinforcing fabric defining windows between said strands, each layer of fluorinated polymer over at least 70 of the area in each of at least 90 of said windows being of uniform thickness within plus or minus 10 . Ion exchange membranes can be derived therefrom by converting the sulfonyl and or carboxyl groups to ion exchange form. Such reinforced membranes can be prepared by 1 continuously bringing at least two films of meltfabricable fluorinated polymer and a web of reinforcing material into face to face contact such that proximate surfaces of two of said films contact opposite planar surfaces of said web, and moving the resulting combination of said films and said web vertically, unsupported except at two opposite edges thereof, 2 removing air from between said films at the two opposite edge portions thereof, 3 applying heat to the two outermost opposite planar film surfaces, first in the center portions thereof and progressively moving toward and including the edge portions thereof, and 4 cooling the resulting reinforced membrane. Apparatus for making reinforced membranes comprises a a frame 1 , and mounted on said frame 1 , b means 17 for guiding at least two continuous webs of film 11 and 12 and a continuous web of reinforcing material 13 into face to face contact such that proximate surfaces of two of said webs of film 11, 12 contact opposite sides of said web of reinforcing material 13 , c two sets of flexible endless belts 20 and 21 42 and not shown which cooperate to engage opposite sides of the resulting assembly of said webs 11, 12 and 13 at the edge portions thereof and to transport said assembly 11, 12 and 13 , each set say 20 consisting of two belts 20, 21 , one belt 20 of each set having a series of perforations 44 along its entire length, each set of belts 20 and 21 42 and not shown extending beyond an edge of said assembly 11, 12 and 13 , and guide means 23, 24 26, 27 for said belts 20 and 21, respectively , d vacuum means including two vacuum manifolds 29 , one manifold 29 adjacent each said perforated belt 20 42 , for removing air from between said films of said assembly 11, 12, 13 at the edge portions thereof through said perforations 44 45 , e two banks of heaters 46 31, 32 , one bank adjacent each exposed film surface, each bank say 31 consisting of a plurality of heaters 46 disposed for heating first the center portion of said assembly 11, 12, 13 and then progressively toward and including the edges thereof as said assembly is transported therebetween, to fuse said assembly 11, 12, 13 into a reinforced membrane 33 , f means 18, 19 for guiding said assembly 11, 12, 13 between said banks of heaters 31, 32 , g a wind up 34 for collecting said reinforced membrane 33 , and h means for driving said wind up 34 . The membranes have exceptional uniformity and, in ion exchange form when used as membranes which separate the compartments of a chloralkali cell, offer the advantages of low operating voltage, low power consumption and high current efficiency, and long useful life without rupture.
