## Description
This invention relates to molecular sieves and, more particularly, to molecular sieving mordenite. Specifically, this invention relates to a method for making molecular sieving mordenite using particular nitrogen containing organic dyes as synthesis directing agents. The term molecular sieve refers to a wide variety of positive ion containing crystalline materials of both natural and synthetic varieties which exhibit the property of acting as sieves on a molecular scale. A major class of molecular sieves are crystalline aluminosilicates, although other crystalline materials are included in the broad definition. Examples of such other crystalline materials include coal, special active carbons, porous glass, microporous beryllium oxide powders, and layer silicates modified by exchange with organic cations. See, D. W. Breck, Zeolite Molecular Sieves Structure, Chemistry, and Use , John Wiley Sons, 1974. Zeolites are crystalline, hydrated, framework aluminosilicates which are based on a three dimensional network of AlO₄ and SiO₄ tetrahedra linked to each other by sharing all of the oxygens. Zeolites may be represented by the empirical formula The structural formula of a zeolite is best expressed for the crystallographic unit cell as M Mordenite is a form of zeolite that occurs naturally and has been prepared synthetically. A typical formula for mordenite in terms of oxides is as follows The term high silica mordenite is used herein to refer to a mordenite structure characterized by a Si Al mole ratio in excess of 5. The literature on molecular sieves suggests that it is not possible to make high silica mordenite by a method that is direct and efficient. Synthesis directing agents are agents which when added to a reaction mixture effect a different crystalline structure than that which would occur but for the addition of such agent, or result in the formation of a crystalline structure wherein an amorphous mixture would otherwise remain. Examples of conventional agents that are currently in use include ammonium and tetrapropyl ammonium ions, and alkyl phosphonium and alkyl arsonium ions. See, L. D. Rollman, Templates in Zeolite Crystallization , In U.S. Patent 4,388,285 there is described a process for the synthesis of ZSM 5 type zeolites using transition metal complexes, as templates for the ZSM 5 type zeolites. The use of phthalocyamines as transition metal complexes is described. From the examples, summarized in Table II, it is clear that ZSM 5 type zeolites are not always produced and some examples lead to the production of mordenite. The patentees say that the results obtained are completely unpredictable. U.S. Patent 4,018,870 discloses the use of certain nitrogen containing dyes including methyl violet and methylene blue in the synthesis of zeolites. By the use of dyes the formation of certain zeolites is suppressed and the formation of novel zeolites promoted. More particularly, the formation of faujasite type zeolites is promoted whilst that of zeolite B is suppressed. There remains the need for making high silica mordenite that is both direct and efficient. The present invention provides a method for making molecular sieving mordenite having a Si Al mole ratio in excess of 5 comprising the following steps The mixture provided for in step A of the process of the invention is preferably prepared in three steps. First, the oxide of silicon source is mixed in water to provide a first mixture. This first mixture is preferably a colloidal dispersion of silica. Second, the nitrogen containing organic dye is mixed with water to provide a second mixture. This second mixture is usually in the form of a dispersion or solution. The oxide of aluminum source is added to the second mixture, then the mineralizing agent is added to the second mixture. Third, these first and second mixtures are mixed together to form a third mixture. This third mixture, which is in the form of a gel, is the mixture called for in step A of the method according to the invention. Stirring or agitation is generally required to effect a homogeneous mixture. The OH to Si mole ratio is preferably in the range of 0.1 to 10. The H₂O to HO mole ratio is preferably in the range of 10 to 1000. The Si Al mole ratio is at least 5, preferably in the range of 5 to 50, more preferably from 6 to 20. The Si to mineralizing agent mole ratio is preferably in the range of 0.1 to 50. The Si to organic dye mole ratio is in the range of 5 to 100, preferably 10 to 60. The oxide of silicon source can be any source that provides silicon oxide, hydroxide or alkoxide. Such sources include silica gel, silicic acid, silica sol and the silicates. Included within the silicates are the alkali and alkaline earth metal silicates with sodium silicate and potassium silicate being preferred. The alkoxides include those alkoxides of up to about 10, preferably up to 6 carbon atoms. The silica sols are aqueous colloidal dispersions containing colloidal silica particles. The solids content of these colloidal dispersions generally ranges up to 70 by weight, and is preferably in the range of 5 to 50 . These dispersions usually include an effective amount of an anionic e.g., acetate, halogen, etc. or cationic e.g., alkali metal, ammonium, etc. stabilizing agent to stabilize the dispersion. Generally the level of addition of such stabilizing agents is up to about 10 by weight of the solids in the dispersion. A commercially available silica sol that is particularly useful is Ludox AS 40 which is a product of DuPont identified as an ammonium stabilized silica sol containing 40 by weight silica. The oxide of aluminum source can be any aluminum source that provides an oxide, hydroxide or alkoxide of aluminum. The alkoxides include those alkoxides of up to 10 carbon atoms, preferably up to 6 carbon atoms. Examples of such sources include sodium aluminate, alumina, aluminum trihydrate and aluminum hydroxide gel. The mineralizing agent is an alkali or alkaline earth metal compound. These compounds include the oxides, hydroxides, inorganic salts e.g., nitrates, phosphates, halides, carbonates, silicates, aluminates and the like as well as the organic salts, e.g., acetates, formates, butyrates, propionates, benzylates and the like . A preferred mineralizing agent is sodium hydroxide. The synthesis directing nitrogen containing organic dye is selected from methyl green, ethyl green, methyl violet, methyl violet 2B, methyl viologen, ethyl viologen, benzyl viologen, betaine viologen and methylene blue. The dye cations are aromatic in character and have a cationic charge of 1 or 2. In the method of the present invention, the mixture provided for in step A containing water the oxide of silicon source the oxide of aluminum source mineralizing agent and synthesis directing organic dye, is in the form of a gel. This gel is thoroughly mixed to homogenize the gel and placed in a reactor. The reactor is preferably an enclosed reactor e.g., a static bomb style reactor . The contents are heated to a temperature in the range of 80 C to 300 C, preferably 100 C to 200 C, to form said mordenite, preferably for one to 100 days, more preferably 10 to 50 days. The pressure within the reactor is preferably at at least the vapor pressure of water at the temperature of the reactor contents. The contents of the reactor are then allowed to cool to room temperature. The crystalline solids are separated from the mother liquor and washed thoroughly with water. Separation can be effected by conventional filtration techniques. The solids can also be washed with an organic solvent, e.g., acetone. The crystalline solids are then allowed to dry in air, such solids being the desired molecular sieving mordenites of the invention. The molecular sieving high silica mordenites that are made by the process of the invention can be represented in terms of mole ratios of oxides by the formula wherein These molecular sieving high silica mordenites have X ray diffraction patterns which exhibit the following significant lines The values were determined by standard techniques. The relative intensities are given in terms of symbols v.s. very strong, s. strong, m. medium, and w. weak. The molecular sieving mordenites can optionally be heat treated at a temperature of 300 C to 900 C, preferably 400 C to 600 C in an inert, oxidizing or reducing atmosphere for a sufficient time to pyrolyze any synthesis directing agent intermixed with such molecular sieving mordenites. The time period for this heat treating step is dependent upon the mass of material being treated. Preferably the heat treating step is conducted for at least 30 minutes, but this time period can be more or less than 30 minutes depending upon the mass of material being treated. The inert atmosphere is preferably nitrogen, argon, helium or neon. The reducing atmosphere is hydrogen or a mixture of hydrogen and one of the above indicated inert gases. The reducing atmosphere can thus contain from 1 to 100 hydrogen, preferably 1 to 20 hydrogen, with the remainder being inert gas. The oxidizing atmosphere can be oxygen or a mixture of oxygen and one of the above indicated inert gases. The oxidizing atmosphere can thus contain from 1 to 100 oxygen, preferably from 1 to 20 oxygen with the remainder being inert gas. A preferred oxidizing atmosphere is air. The molecular sieving mordenites of the invention can be cation exchanged with an ammonium salt or the salt of a catalytically active metal. The salt of the catalytically active metal is preferably the salt of a Group VIII, IB or IIB metal, with zinc, copper, nickel, cobalt and iron being preferred. The anionic portions of these salts are preferably inorganic and include the nitrates, phosphates, carbonates and halides. The cation exchange procedure employed herein is entirely conventional. Briefly, the mordenite and the ammonium salt or salt of catalytically active metal are dispersed in water for a few minutes to several hours, preferably about one to about ten hours, and maintained at about room temperature to about the boiling point of the water, then filtered and washed, with the result being the formation of the cation exchanged molecular sieving mordenite. This procedure can be carried out once or repeatedly depending on the degree of exchange desired. Optionally, the cation exchanged molecular sieving mordenite can be heat treated in an inert, oxidizing or reducing atmosphere using the heat treating procedures described above to convert the cation exchanged species to a more active form. This heat treating procedure is particularly suitable for driving off ammonia from an ammonium molecular sieving mordenite to convert such molecular sieving mordenite to the acid form. An advantage of the present invention is that the organic dyes employed herein do not tend to occlude within the molecular sieving mordenites produced herein. Thus the use of heat treating procedures to pyrolize the dye can be avoided. Since these organic dyes are relatively stable under the synthesis conditions employed herein and thus do not undergo significant breakdown during synthesis, it is possible to recycle these dyes or use them as catalysts in continuous processes. The molecular sieving high silica mordenites of the present invention can be used in many of the known applications for mordenites. They are particularly suitable as adsorbents.
