# ALTERNATING CURRENT DRIVEN LATCHING RELAY AND METHOD OF OPERATION

## Abstract
An alternating current latching relay is provided which employs a latching type, mechanically operated snap action switch mechanism with a set of electric contacts that are selectively latched either in the open or closed condition in a snap action manner upon successive actuations of the snap action mechanism by suitable push rod means for in itiating its operation. At least one alternating current excited bender type piezoelectric drive member has one end secured to a common base member with the latching type snap ac tion switch mechanism and the remaining free end engaging the push rod means. An alternative current electric excitation signal is directly applied to the piezoelectric plate elements of the bender type drive member for mechanically vibrating the bender type drive member in a manner such that its am plitude of vibration quickly builds up to a value where it repeatedly strikes the push rod means with sufficient force to selectively actuate the snap action switch mechanism to the opposite one of its two operating conditions from that in which it originally was set. A tuning mass in the form of a slug element is secured to the end of the bender type drive member to reduce the natural resonant frequency of vibra tion of the bender type drive member to substantially the frequency of the alternating current excitation signal to thereby increase the amplitude of its vibrations to a maxi mum. Additionally, the tuning mass increases the impulse delivered by the bender type drive member to the push rod for actuating the snap action mechanism.
