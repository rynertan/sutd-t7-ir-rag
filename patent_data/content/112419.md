## Description
Pharmacologically Active Compounds This invention relates to novel compounds, pharmaceutical compositions containing them, their formùlation into pharmaceutical compositions, their use in therapy, and a process for their preparation. It is known that some types of cells are activated by antibody antigen combination and release substances which mediate the allergic response. It has been reported that SRS A the slow reacting substance of anaphylaxis , released from such cells which have been activated by antibody antigen combinations, plays an important role in the development of allergic and asthmatic phenomena. It is known that certain nitrocoumarins and cyanohydroxycoumarins and indanediones protect against the release of mediators of the allergic response, such asSRS A, and inhibit their action. We have now discovered a class of compounds which not only inhibit the release of mediator substances but also antagonize the effects of SRS A released after the above mentioned antibody antigen combinations. Thus these compounds are of value in the prophylaxis and treatment of diseases whose symptoms are controlled by the mediators of the allergic response, for example asthma, hay fever, rhinitis and allergic eczema. Accordingly, the present invention provides a compound of the formula I , and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof,EMI2.1 wherein R1 is hydrogen or C1 6 alkyl r2, R3 and R4 are the same or different and are chosen from hydrogen, hydroxyl, halogen, C1 4 alkyl,C1 4 alkoxy and C1 4 alkanoyl G is H or OH and m and n are independently 1 to 3 with the proviso that when G 5 OH, one of m or n is 1. Suitable examples of R1 include hydrogen, methyl, ethyl and n and iso propyl. When other than hydrogen,R1 is suitably in the 5 position that is, substituting the carbon atom adjacent to the carbon atom bearing the carbonyl moiety Preferably R1 is hydrogen or 5 methyl or 5 n propyl. n may suitably be 1 or 2, preferably 1. More preferably m and n are each 1. The phenoxyalkoxy side chain oxygen atom may join the naphtho 2,3 d v triazole nucleus at any nonbridgehead carbon in the benzo moiety. More suitably however it will be joined at the 6 position that is, substituting the carbon atom meta to the carbon atom bearing tne carbonyl moiety . Examples of R2, R3 and R4 include hydrogen, and hydroxyl. Examples of R2 to R4 when halogen include fluorine, chlorine and bromine, most suitably fluorine. Examples of suitable C1 4 alkyl substituents falling within the definitions of R2 to R4 are methyl, ethyl, n and iso propyl, n , iso and t butyl, preferably n propyl. Examples of suitable C1 4 alkoxy substituents falling within the definitions of R2 to R4 are methoxy, ethoxy, nand iso propoxy. Examples of suitable C1 4 alkanoyl groups included within the definition of R2 to R4 are acetyl, propionyl, and n and iso butyryl, preferably acetyl. Favourably only one of R2 to R4 is hydroxyl. When one of these groups is hydroxyl it is favourably in the 3 position in the phenyl ring with respect to the alkylenedioxy group. Favourably only one of R2 to R4 is C14 alkyl.When C1 4 alkyl, such a group is favourably in the 2position in the phenyl ring as hereinbefore defined. Favourably only one of R2 to R4 is C14 alkanoyl.When C14 alkanoyl, such a group is favourably in the 4 position in the phenyl ring as hereinbefore defined. Where a highly substituted compound of formula I is required it will be appreciated that the substituents are to be chosen for steric compatability. For example1 where two or three of the substituents are groups such as highly branched C14 alkyl, C1 4 alkoxy or C 1 4 alkanoyl groups, then these will not occupy adjacent positions. G is preferably OH. The triazole moiety of the compounds of formula I has an acidic hydrogen, and accordingly may form salts.Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts falling within the scope of this invention include the aluminium, alkali metal and alkaline earth metal salts such as the sodium, potassium and magnesium salts and salts with ammonia, organic bases and amino compounds. From the aforesaid it will be appreciated that one particularly useful sub group of compounds of the formula I is of formula II EMI4.1 wherein p is 2 to 4 the phenoxyalkoxy side chain is joined at the 5 or 6 as indicated position. and the remaining variables are as defined in formula I . p is preferably 3. Suitable and preferred variables R1, R2, K3 andR4 are as hereinbefore described ,as are suitable and preferred substitution positions. Thus when one of R2, R3 and R4 is the only one of these variables to be C14 alkyl it is preferably in the phenyl 2 position as hereinbefore defined. It is particularly preferably n propyl. When one of R2, R3 and R4 is the only one of these variables to be hydroxy it is preferably in the phenyl 3 position as hereinbefore defined. When one of R2, R3 and R4 is the only one of these variables to be C14 alkanoyl it is preferably in the phenyl group 4 position as hereinbefore defined. Preferably the side chain is in the 6 position. Preferably R1, when other than hydrogen, is in the 5 position. One preferred group of compounds of the formula I is of the formula III EMI6.1 wherein ml and n are independently 1 or 2 the phenoxyalkoxy side chain is joined at the 5 or 6position and the remaining variables are as defined in formula I . 1 and n1 are preferably both 1. m Suitable and preferred variables R1, R2, R3 and R4 are as hereinbefore described under formula II , as are suitable and preferred substitution positions. The present invention also provides a process for the preparation of a compound of the formula I , which process comprises the de protection of a compound of the formula IV EMI7.1 wherein L is a protecting group and the remaining variables are as defined in formula I . L may be any convenient protecting group removable without destruction of the rest of the molecule. Examples of suitable L groups include a Labile benzyl groups, such as 4 methoxybenzyl, which are removable for example with strong acid, such as with trifluoroacetic acid at 20 800C. b Benzyl, or benzyl groups substituted with groups such as C14 alkyl, C14 alkoxy, halogen or nitro, which are removable under basic conditions with for example methoxide or ethoxide ions at slightly elevated temperatures in a solvent such as dimethyl formamide. c A trityl group, or such a group in which the phenyl moieties may be substituted by one or two inert substitutents selected from C13 a lkyl, C1 3 alkoxy and halogen, which groups are generally removable with mineral acid such as hydrochloric acid in acetic acid, again at slightly elevated temperatures. d Other labile groups, such as benzhydryl. The compounds of formula IV are believed to be novel, and as such form an important aspect of this invention. The compounds of the formula I may themselves be prepared by coupling a compound of the formula 1,7 EMI9.1 with a compound of the formula VI EMI9.2 wherein X is hydrogen and Y is a group Z CH2 mCH2 CH2 n where Z is hydroxyl or a group readily displaceable by a nucleophile from an aliphatic moiety, or Y is hydrogen and X is a group CH2 mCH2 CH2 nZ where Z is as defined, the remaining variables being as defined in formula I to give a compound of the formula V wherein G is hydrogen or wherein X isEMI9.3 or CH2 mCH OH CH2Cl and Y is hydrogen, or Y isEMI9.4 or CH2ClCH OHXCH2 n and X is hydrogen to give a carpound of formula IV wherein G is hydroxyl and n or m respectively is 1. When Z is a group readily displaceable by a nucleophile, suitable examples of Z include halogen atoms such as chlorine, bromine and iodine, and activated ester groups such as methanesulphonate and tosylate groups. When one of R2 to R4 is hydroxyl it will in general be necessary to protect such a hydroxyl group during the above reaction. This may suitably be effected by conversion to a benzyloxy group, optionally monosubstituted by methoxy or nitro before reaction, the benzyloxy group being converted to hydroxy by conventional hydroqenolysis after the reaction. If such a hydroxy group is adjacent to another one of R2 to R4 which isC1 4 alkanoyl, protection is not necessary. When in the compounds of the formula r and VI , X is a group CH2 nCH2 CH2 nZ or Y is a group ZI CHzmCH2 CH2 n, where ZI is a group readily displaced by a nucleophile from an aliphatic moiety, when or x respectively are hydrogen, the reaction is generally carried out in the presence of a moderate base in a polar solvent. Examples of suitable bases include basic alkali metal salts such as the carbonates, for instance potassium carbonate. Examples of suitable solvents include ketones such as methyl ethyl ketone. The reaction is conveniently carried out under reflux at temperatures of 50 to 110 C depending on the solvent, base and particular starting materials employed.The reaction time will depend on these parameters and on the temperature employed and this may readily be determined by routine trial and error. The reaction may be monitored by conventional methods such as thin layer chromatographyBy way of example a reaction time of up to 24 hours is often suitable. When the compounds of the formulae V ana nJIX, X is a group CH2 mCHz cH2 nOM or Y is a group HO CH2 n CH2 CH2 n, when Y and X respectively will be hydrogen, the reaction of these compounds is generally carried out in the presence of a compound of formula VI D O2C N N CO2E VII wherein D and E are independently C1 6 alkyl, aryl or aryl C1 6 alkyl, generally both ethyl, and a compound of formula VIII PR5R6R7 VIII wherein R5, R6 and R7 are independently C1 6 alkyl, C1 6 alkoxy, aryl, aryloxy, aryl C1 6 alkyl or aryl Cl 6 alkoxy, generally all phenyl. The reaction is generally carried out at a nonextreme temperature, such as 20 to 100 C, in an inert aprotic organic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxan, ethyl acetate or benzene. When in the compounds of the formula V and VI , X is a groupEMI11.1 or Y is a groupEMI11.2 when Y or X respectively will be hydrogen, the reaction is generally carried out in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst such as benzyltrimethylammonium hydroxide, conveniently at temperatures of 50 to 1100C, in a polar solvent such as dimethylformamide.A temperature dependent reaction time of 4 to 14 hours is usually sufficient. When in the compounds of formula V and VI X is CH2 mCH OH CH2Cl and Y is hydrogen, the reaction is conveniently carried out using the compound of formula VI in anion form prepared for example with sodium hydride in dimethyl formamide , at slightly elevated temperatures of around 60 800C. Compounds of the formula V wherein X is hydrogen are either known compounds or may be prepared analogously to known compounds. Compounds of formula V wherein X is other than hydrogen may be prepared in analogous manner to the reactions described in Buckle et al, J Med Chem, 22, 158 1979 . By way of illustration, such compounds wherein X is CCH2 mCH2CCH2 nZ may be prepared by reacting the X is hydrogen compound with B CH2 mCH2 CH2 nZ whereinB is chlorine, bromine or iodine Z when hydroxy may be subseouentlv conventionallv estified to aive an activated ester group and wherein X isEMI12.1 mav be PrePared bv reactina the X is hvdroaen compound withEMI12.2 Compounds of the formula VI wherein Y is other than hydrogen may similarly be prepared in known manner from the corresponding Y is hydrogenEMI13.1 example by reacting with Z CH2 mCH2 CH2 mB or Such reactions are generally carried out in the presence of a strong base in a polar solvent, some of the polar solvent often going to form the base. Examples of suitable bases include sodium in an alcohol such as tert butanol, sodium hydride or hydroxide in dimethylsulphoxide or dimethylformamide and lithium di isopropylamide in hexamethylphosphoramide. Temperatures of 5 to 900C may be used depending on the solvent, base and particular starting materials employed. The reaction time will depend on these parameters and on the temperature employed and this may readily be determined by routine trial and error.The reaction may be monitored by conventional methods such as thin layer chromatography. By way of example a reaction time of up to 1 hour is often suitable at ambient temperatures. Compounds of the formula VI wherein Y is H may be prepared by reaction of a compound of formula X EMI14.1 with a compound of formula LB wherein L and B are as hereinbefore defined. The reaction may suitably be effected using a base such as an alkali metal carbonate, suitably potassium,in a polar aprotic solvent such as dimethylfozmamide at temperatures between 20 and 1200, suitably around 40 500C. It should perhaps be noted that with certain L groups, such as trityl, the N 2 protected isomer is formed preferentially which simplifies the workup procedure but with other L groups, such as 4methoxybenzyl, a mixture of the three possible N l, N 2 and N 3 protected isomers is formed, which isomers may be separated or used collectively in the coupling reactions the end product after deprotection is the same . Compounds of formula X may be prepared in a number of ways a Nitration of the naphthotriazole XI EMI14.2 results in the formation of the 5 and 6 nitro derivatives when R1 is H, the respective ratio is 9 1 and these may be converted directly into the corresponding 5and 6 OH compounds of formula X with aldoximate anion in DMSO at room temperature having first converted the nitro derivatives to their sodium salts . The 5and 6 derivatives may be separated either at the nitro stage, or after conversion to the hydroxy compounds, by conventional techniques. The compounds of formula XI themselves may be prepared as in uro ean Patent t umber 0 002 310. b Photolysis of a naphthotriazole of formula XI wherein R1 is hydrogen, leads directly to the 6hydroxy derivative, the reaction being carried out in concentrated sulphuric acid at room temperature in a similar manner to that described for anthraquinone A D Broadbent and J M Stewart, Chem Commun, 1980, 676 . c De alkylation of the corresponding methyl ethers, using well known procedures such as ethylthiolate anion in N,N dimethyl formamide Feutrill et al,Tet Letters, 1970, 1327 lithium iodide in 2,4,6collidine Harrison, Chem Comm, 1969, 616 or boron trihalide dimethylsulphide complexes Williard et al, Tet Letters, 1980, 3731 .

Compositions of this invention may also suitably be presented for administration to the respiratory tract as a snuff or an aerosol or solution for a nebulizer, or as a microfine powder for insufflation, alone or in combination with an inert carrier such as lactose. In such a case the particles of active compound suitably have diameters of less than 50 microns, preferably less than 10 microns. Where appropriate, small amounts of other anti asthmatics and bronchodilators for example sympathomimetic amines such as isoprenaline, isoetharine, salbutamol, phenylephrine and ephedrine xanthine derivatives such as theophylline and aminophylline and corticosteroids such as prednisolone and adrenal stimulants such as ACTH may be included.

Pharmacological Data SectionActivities in biological test systems The compounds were tested for their ability to a inhibit rat passive peritoneal anaphylaxis and b antagonise the spasmogenic effects of slow reacting substance of anaphylaxis, SRS A, on isolated guinea pig ileum. The methods used are described below.Animals Charles River Sprague Dawley male rats of 250 300 g.and Dunkin Hartley male white guinea pigs of 250 300 g. were used.Rat Passive Peritoneal Anaphylaxis PPA The method has been described previcusly. Ross, Janet W.,Smith, H. and Spicer, Barbara A. Increased vascular permeability during passive peritoneal anaphylaxis in the rat.Int. Arch. Allergy appl. Immun., 51, 226, 1976 . Antiserum Rats were sensitised by giving an intraperitoneal injection of 0.5 ml of Bordetella pertussis vaccine 10 4 x 10 organisms ml Burroughs Wellcome, London and a subcutaneous injection of 0.5 ml of an emulsion of 100 mg of ovalbumin chicken egg albumin, crystallised and lyophilised, grade 3, Sigma, London in 2 ml of isotonic saline and 3 ml of Freund s incomplete adjuvant Difco Laboratories, Michigan,USA . The rats were bled by cardiac puncture, on day 18, the blood was pooled, and the serum separated, stored at 200C and thawed only once before use. The serum was shown to contain immunoglobulin E IgE antibody by its ability to sensitise rats for passive cutaneous anaphylaxis carried out as described Spicer, Barbara A Ross, Janet W., and Smith, H Inhibition of immediate hypersensitivity reactions in the rat by disodium cromoglycate and, a nitroindanedione, Clin. exp.,Immunol., 21, 419 1975 to a dilution of 1 32 to 1 64 persisting for at least 72 hours after sensitisation.Passive peritoneal anaphylaxis Rats were each given an intraperitoneal injection of 2 ml of a 1 5 dilution of the rat anti serum in isotonic saline. Two hours later 0.3 ml of a 5 solution of PontamineSky Blue Raymond A. Lamb, London in isotonic saline was injected intravenously, followed by an intraperitoneal injection of the test compound in 1 ml of saline control rats received 1 ml of saline followed 30 seconds later by an intraperitoneal injection of 5 ml of Tyrode s solution containing 50 pg ml heparin and 0.4 mg ml of ovalbumin.The concentrations of the compounds were quoted as those in the 6 ml of fluid injected intraperitoneally. Exactly five minutes after challenge the rats were stunned and bled and their peritoneal fluids were collected by,opening their peritoneal cavities over funnels into polycarbonate tubes in ice. The supernatants were separated from the cellular residue by centrifuging at 150 g. for five minutes and were retained for assay of dye and histamine. Any samples obviously contaminated with blood were not used for estimation of dye. Groups of at least five rats were used for each dose of compound and the treatments were randomised. Assay of peritoneal fluids Dye was assayed within two hours by measurement of optical density OD at 625 nm. For histamine assay 0.5 ml samples of the supernatants were added to I ml volumes of 12 trichloracetic acid and stored at 200C. The deproteinised samples were assayed using an automated spectrofluorimetric system TechniconAutoanalyser by a method similar to that of Evans, D.9. Lewis, J.A. and Thomson, D.S. An automated fluorimetric assay for the rapid determination of histamine in biological fluids. Life Sci., 12, 327, 1973 . At the concentrations used the compounds tested did not interfere with the assay. SRS A Antagonist Activity The compounds have been evaluated as direct antagonists of slow reacting substance of anaphylaxis SRS A by assay using the isolated guinea pig ileum. SRS A rat was obtained from the peritoneal cavity of the rat after passive peritoneal anaphylaxis by a method based on that of R.P. Orange, D.J. Stechschulte and S.F. Austen,J. Immunology, 105, 1087 1970 as described by J. W. Ross,H. Smith and B. A. Spicer 1976, Increased vascular permeability during passive peritoneal anaphylaxis in the rat.Int. Arch. Allergy appl., 51, 226. The sensitising serum containing antibody was produced in rats as described byJ. W. Ross et. al., ibid. 2 ml of a 1 in 5 dilution of the sensitising serun was injected by the peritoneal route into recipient rats and after 2 hours 5 ml of Tyrode s solution containing 0.4 mg ml ovalbumin Sigma Grade III and 50 Vg ml heparin was injected by the same route. Five minutes after challenge the rats were stunned and bled and the peritoneal fluids collected into polycarbonate tubes in ice. After centrifugation at 150 g. for five minutes the supernatants were combined, heated in a boiling water bath for five minutes, cooled and stored at 200C. The combined peritoneal fluids contained SRS A and were used in the antagonism studies. The SRS A assays were carried out on isolated stripes of guinea pig ileum in Tyrode s solution containing atropine 5 x 10 7M and mepyramine 10 6M as described by W.E. Brocklehurst,J. Physiology, 151, 416 1960 . The activity of the antagonists was determined by their ability to reduce submaximal responses induced by SRS A. The antagonists were added to the 4 ml bath in 0.1 ml volumes in aqueous solution half a minute before the addition of SRS A and were present during induced contraction.Results The results obtained in these tests, which are shown in the following Tables demonstrate the ability of the compounds not only to inhibit the release of mediator substances but also to antagonise the effects of released SRS A.
