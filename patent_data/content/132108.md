# Combinatorial weighing apparatus.

## Abstract
A semiautomatic combinatorial weighing apparatus in which an operator manually supplies a combinatorial weigh ing apparatus with articles to be weighed is provided with hopper sets each of which has two weighing hoppers 14 and a single movable pool hopper 9 for supplying the articles to the weighing hopper to which it is moved. An article supply table 3 is capable of being swung open by virtue of a hinge mechanism, and a plate constituting the top of the supply table is capable of being removed. This arrangement allows the pool hoppers and weighing hoppers to be detached from the combinatorial weighing apparatus for the purpose of being cleaned.
