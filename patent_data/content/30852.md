# Vacuum power interrupting device.

## Abstract
A vacuum power interrupting device comprises a disk shaped supporting block 4 of a synthetic insulating resin in which the vacuum interrupter 3 is molded, a stationary elec trode 23 connected to a stationary contact rod disposed within the vacuum interrupter, and a tubular insulating barrier 31 integrally formed with the supporting block so as to sur round the stationary electrode. The vacuum power interrupt ing device further comprises an electromagnet supported by a plurality of supporting poles 47a, 47b extending along the outer circumferential surface of the supporting block and an armature member 44 of a magnetic material responsive to the electromagnet and supported by an insulating rod 43 connected to the movable contact rod. Thus, the armature member is in contact with or away from an iron core 52 of the electromagnet in accordance with the energized or deener gized condition of the electromagnet to bring the vacuum interrupter 3 into an interrupted condition or a closed condi tion.
