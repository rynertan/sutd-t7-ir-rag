# Fixed data reading apparatus and method.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a fixed data reading system which com prises a read only memory 2 for storing program data and fixed data, a random access memory 4 for storing non program data, a program counter for specifying a location of the read only memory 2 , an incrementer for increment ing the contents of the program counter 8 , and a program counter input register 24 for supplying the incremented program counter contents to the program counter at a predetermined timing. The random access memory 4 includes a data counter area for storing an address specify ing a location of the read only memory 2 in which the fixed data is stored. When the instruction for reading fixed data in the read only memory 2 is decoded, an address is supplied from the data counter area allocated in the random access memory 4 to the program counter 8 . When executing an ordinary instruction, the corresponding address is supplied from the program counter input register 24 to the program counter 8 .
