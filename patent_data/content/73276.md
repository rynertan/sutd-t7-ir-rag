## Description
A METHOD OF INCREASING THE FEED EFFICIENCY OF ANIMATES, AND COMPOSITIONS FOR USE IN SUCH A METHOD This invention relates to the field of agents used to promote fed zfficiency in animals, particularly when administered as feed additives, and to a method for promoting the growth rate of foodproducing animals, especially livestock and poultry, Ã…and for increasing animal products, for example, milk production in mammalian species and egg production in avian species. It is generally accepted that the meat, poultry, dairy and cultivated fishing industries provide the most inefficient source of food for human consumption. These industries use feed sources for example, grains, fruits, and vegetables which are also a primary source of nutrients for humans. The production of livestock, poultry and cultivated fish entails the consumption of more primary source protein and carbohydrates fit for human consumption than is replaced by that of the resultant animal.In addition to the actual reduction in primary source foods for human consumption created by these industries, the cost of protein and carbohydrate supplied for human consumption through secondary sources is substantially magnified. In view of these considerations, there is need for improvement in the utilization of animal feed in the raising of animals as secondary food sources. A number of synthetic chemical compounds and naturally occurring materials have been utilized to increase the growth rate of animals and to decrease the consumption of animal foodstuffs. These agents fall into a number of categories, including antibacterials, such as, sulpha drugs and ant biotics parasitie prophylactics metabolic drugs sedatives or tranquilizers and, in ruminants, nitrogen supplements and rumen bacterial respiration modifiers. The antibacterials are effective by reducing the incidence of bacterial disease in the animal population. The antiparasitic agents are effective in reducing the incidence of parasitic infection. Metabolic drugs increase metabolic synthesis of protein and include the hormones1 such as, estrogens, progesterone and diethylstilbesterol. Sedatives and tranquilizers effect a reduction in animal movement and hyperactivity resulting in greater protein synthesis and weight retention.Sedatives and tranquilizers of the triazole and benzdiazepine class of compounds have been disclosed as useful in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,914,245 to Gall et al and 3,933,794 to Hester et al. Ruminant feed containing supplemental nitrogen enhances protein synthesis. Nitrogen supplements have been disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,989,846 to Helgerson slow release urea composition 3,843,799 to Elofson et al complex glucosylurea converted to ammonia in rumen and 4,044,156 toDiner et al monoglucoxyl, ureide . Ruminant feed supplements which are formulated to be resistant to microbial breakdown in the rumen, but not resistant to substantial digestive breakdown in the abomasum and intestines have been disclosed in U.S.Patent Nos. 3,988,480 to Ames et al 3,959,493 to Ballsrudet al 4,001,390 to Fildes and 3,562,806 to Grant et al Rumen bacterial respiration modifiers act through an effect on the bacterial population ordinarily present in the animals digestive system and reduce the amount of bacterial products which are not absorbed by the ruminant. Feed supplements for ruminants which influence the O R potential of microfloral respiration in the rumen have been disclosed as feed efficiency agents inU.S. Patent No. 2,808,332 to Anderson et al. The reduction of gaseous waste production in ruminants has been reported in U.S. Patent No. 3,801,710 toParish et al which discloses the administration to ruminants of certain haloaldehyde sulthonates and phosphonates. U.S. Patent 3,796,797 to Parish discloses the administration to ruminants of a chloral molasses feed. Other agents, such as anticholinergics, have also been used. Most of the known growth promotants can have undesired side effects. The antibacterials and anitparasitics pose the problem that their use will result in resistant strains of disease causing bacteria. Hormonal agents can also produce unwanted side effects, and in some cases, such agents have been shown to be carcinogenic. Sedatives and tranquilizers can leave undesirable residues in the animal. The effectiveness of anticholinergics is limited due to the undesirable side effects manifested when therapeutic doses are administered. The present invention is directed to improved means for effecting feed efficiency in animals.More particularly it is directed to a method for increasing the feed efficiency of animals. Accordingly this invention provides a method for increasing the r efficiency of an animal, which method comprises administering to the animal one or more feed efficiency agents, being compounds which increase the dwell time of nutrient matter in the digestive tract of the animal and which thereby afford an increase in digestive absorption, the one or more agents being administered to the animal for a period of time sufficient to allow an increase in the digestion and absorption level of nutrients ingested by the animal above the level which would have been achieved had the agent or agents not been administered to the animal. Numerous benefits are achieved as a result of the use of the present invention. The increase in the digestive absorption of nutrient matter manifests itself over a period of time in either a material increase in weight of the animal, or in the same increase in weight achieved in a lesser period of time or with a reduction in the quantity of the animals dietary intake. This is realized without the adverse side effects that accompany the use of other growth promotants, and with the additional benefit that there is a reduction in waste generation by the animal owing to a more efficient digestive process. Another benefit of this invention resides in. shortening the period of growth from infancy to maturity in animals which produce food, inincreasing the production or development of other animal products, by application of the invention during the growth stages of the animals. Still another benefit of this invention is that the feed conversion ratio of a healthy feeding animal may be increased. It has been found that certain antimotility agents are especially effective in lowering the unit amount of food consumed by feeding animals per unit increase in animal product output. As the term is used herein, an animal product may be the animal itself, alive or dead, or substances produced and taken from the animal while alive, such as eggs, meat, wool or fur. In standard laboratory screening tests, described more fully below, certain antimotility agents have been shown to be effective in increasing the residence time in the animal of ingested food, and effecting a corresponding increase in the amount of digestible materials actually digested and absorbed by the test animal. A particular class of compounds preferred for use as feed efficiency agents in the present invention are amidinoureas having antimotility properties, for example, the amidinoureas of general formula I defined below. These are readily absorbed through the intestinal wall of mammals and fowl, and may be administered as compositions formulated as tablets, capsules, powders or liquids suitable for either direct oral administration or in comb ination with animal feed. However, other antimotility agents may be used in the present invention, e.g. diphenoxylates and loperamide. The antimotility agents used to increase feed efficiency can, if desired, be used in combination with other food additives such as growth promoters, compositions for providing electrolyte balance, agents for improving taste, smell, texture and the like, or with therapeutic agents such as sulphonamides, sulphones, antibiotics, hormones, or with other suitable excipients. Various amidinoureas falling within the broad class of compounds useful as feedefficiency agen ts in the present invention are known also for the purpose of treating certain veterinary diseases, such as scours. However, for veterinary purposes such compounds are administered for limited periods of time at therapeutic dosages to counter the disease. In contrast, the present invention relates to the continuous feeding or the feeding on a regular basis of a non therapeutic dosage of a feed efficiency agent irrespective of the presence of any veterinary disease in the animal and for an extended period of time. In normal use, this invention is practiced on a large number of healthy feeding animals, such as, a herd of cattle or a flock of sheep, instead of selectively administering a therapeutic dose of compound to sickly members of the animal group. Amidinoureas suitable for use as feed efficiency agents in this invention are compounds of the formula EMI7.1 therein either R1 is phenyl, substituted phenyl as defined herein , alkyl, heterocycle as defined herein or substituted heterocycle as defined herein , and R2, R5 and R6, which may be the same or different, are hydrogen, lower alkyl, hydroxy, lower alkoxy, lower alkenyl, cyclo loweralkenyl, cyclo lower alkyl, aralkyl, lower alkynyl, halo alkyl, hydroxy lower alkyl, lower alkoxy lower alkyl, cyano lower alkyl, amino lower alkyl, monoor di lower alkyl amino lower alkyl, carbamoyl lower alkyl, mono or di alkyl carbamoyl lower alkyl, lower alkoxy carbamoyl lower alkyl, aralkoxy carbamoyl lower alkyl, acyl lower alkyl, alkyl sulphonyl or aralkyl sulphonyl, with the additional possibility that R5, R6 and the intervening nitrogen atom may together form a 5 or 6 membered heterocyclic ring which optionally may include 1 or 2 additional hetero atoms chosen independently from oxygen, nitrogen and sulphur or R is phenyl, substituted phenyl as defined 5 herein , aralkyl, heterocycle as defined herein or substituted heterocycle as defined herein , andR1, R2 and R6, which may be the same or different, are hydrogen, lower alkyl, hydroxy, lower alkoxy, lower alkenyl, cyclo lower alkenyl, cyclo lower alkyl, aralkyl, lower alkynyl, halo alkyl, hydroxy lower alkyl, lower alkoxy lower alkyl, cyano lower alkyl, amino lower alkyl, mono or di lower alkyl amino lower alkyl, carbamoyl lower alkyl, mono or di alkyl carbamoyl lower alkyl, lower alkoxy c arb amoyl lowe r alkyl, aralkoxy carbamoyl lower alkyl, acyl lower alkyl, alkyl sulphonyl or aralkyl sulphonyl, with the additional possibility that either R1, R2 and the intervening nitrogen atom may together form a 5 or 6 membered heterocyclic ring, or R1, R3 and the intervening two nitrogen atoms and carbon atom may together form a 5 to 8 membered heterocyclic ring, which ring may in either case optionally include 1 or 2 additional hetero atoms chosen independently from oxygen, nitrogen and sulphur and R3 when not forming part of a heterocyclic ring with R1 and R4, which may be the same or different, are hydrogen, lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, lower alkenyl, lower alkynyl, cyclo lower alkyl or aralkyl3 or non toxic acid addition salts thereof.

In addition to the amidinoureas illustrated above as suitable feed efficiency agents fe r use in accordance with the method of this invention, other agents possessing antimotility activity and lacking growth retardant properties such as diphenoxy lates and loperamide can also be used. Moreover these agents, including the amidin oureas, can be used in combination as well as singly. It will be appreciated that agents which have antimotility activity but which possess additional properties which act to retard digestion and absorption of feed nutrients should not be employed in the method of this invention. The effective dosage of a feed effic iency agent in the method of this invention will be relatively much smaller than dosages commonly employed to obtain a thera peutic effect. For example, in a preferred embodiment of the method of the invention, the feed efficiency agents preferably the amidinoureas of Formulae I to VI are utilized in a dosage of from about O.005 mg kg to about but preferably below 0.5 mkg,or more pre ferably from about 0.01 mg kg to about but preferably below O l mg kg daily. A parttcularly.preferred feed efficiency agent is 3 2,6 dimethylphenyl 1 methyl amidino urea, administreted at the dosages just indicated. The amidinoureas are conveniently used in the form of pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts, preferably the hydrochloride salt. The feed efficiency agents employed in accordance with this invention are preferably administered as part of the animal s feed, and thus in association with nutrients or feed supplements. Accordingly, this invention provides a composition for use in increasing the feed efficiency of animals, which composition comprises one or more feed efficiency agents, being compounds which increase the dwell time of nutrient matter in the digestive tract of the animal and which thereby afford an increase in digestive absorption, together with one or more feed supplement agents, being compounds which supplement the animal s daily dietary intake, or with at least a portion of the daily dietary intake. Thus the composition of the invention may take the form of a liquid or solid feed supplement, for instance a feed block, containing a feed efficiency agent and a feed supplement agent. The latter may be chosen from among the feed supplements commonly used in animal husbandry for example protein supplements wich are used in feeding cattle and sheep , bonemeal, salt, trace minerals, vitamins, an electrolyte, antibiotics, growth promoters e.g. growth hormones antibacterial agents, antiparasitics and tranquilizers etc. The feed efficiency agent may be incorporated directly in the animal s daily dietary intake, for instance in silage, oats, barley, bran and the like. Where the feed efficiency agent is distributed uniformly throughout substantially the whole of the animal s daily dietary intake, as is preferred, the concentration of the feed efficiency agent in the intake will be from about 0.5 or about 1.0 ppm to about 20 ppm, preferably to about 10 ppm. Such an intake is a composition of the invention, and consumption thereof by an animal will normally be sufficient to increase substantially the animal s food retention and produce higher feed efficiency. By way of example, calves in their early to mid growth stage will show better food utilization when about 0.5 or 1.0 to 10 milligrams, preferably about 1 to about 5 milligrams and more preferably about 1 to about 2.5 milligrams of feed efficiency agent, particularly an amidinourea of formulae I to Viz is uniformly distributed throughout one kilogram of the animal Is daily dietary intake. Uniform distribution of the feed efficiency agent throughout the animals dietary intake may be achieved by providing the agent in the form of a powder or pellets or the like which may easily be distributed in the intake. Alternatively a feed premix for distribution throughout the daily dietary intake may be prepared, which pre mix contains a feed efficiency agent together with either a feed supplement as above and or a portion of the intake. Preferably the pre mix will comprise a portion of the intake and from 0.2 to 0.4 based on the weight of the premix of the feed efficiency agent this premix to be mixed with substantially the remainder of the animal s daily dietary intake in a ratio of about ilb of premix.to about one ton of intake about 7 kg of premix to about 1 tonne of intake . Such a pre mix is a composition of this invention. The concentration of the feed efficiency agent in the animal s daily dietary intake and in the feed pre mix, and theconcen traction of the premix in the intake,given above aSsume an average consumption of feed by the animals in question. If however the animals consumption departs from the average, the above concentrations should be altered in order to ensure that each animal receives an effective daily dosage of feed efficiency agent. The feed efficiency agents may also if desired be fed directly to the animals with or without suitable diluents and other edible excipints The method of this invention is useful for improving the feed efficiency of all animals grown for commercial food production purposes, including those animals which are grown for meat production such as cattle, sheep, hogs, rabbits, chickens, ducks, geese, turkeys, pheasants and the like, as well as those animals which are grown for production of other food or useful animal products such as dairy products, eggs, wool, fur and the like. Use of the method of this invention will shorten the growth period when fed to animals during their growing stages thereby reducing the time from birth to slaughter for animals grown for products such as meat, furs and the like.Thus the method of the invention is preferably applied during the animal s normal growth stages. When used with mature animals however, the compositions and method of this invention are very effective to reduce the animals feed requirement whilst maintaining the animal at full productivity, especially with work animals such as horses, In all cases, the use of the method of this invention provides a greater output of animal products relative to the amount of animal feed consumed than could be achieved by maintaining the animal at the same feed regimen without feed efficiency agents. It should be understood that the examples given herein are by way of illustration only and are not to be construed as limiting the invention, which contemplates the administration of any compound possessing antimotility properties, or which enhances feed retention time in an animal and so increases nutrient digestive and absorptive activity, to food producing animals which provide meat, milk, etc., particularly livestock and poultry, to obtain higher food production per unit of animal feed consumed.
