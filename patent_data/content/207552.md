# Method and device for manufacturing a connector part for an optical connector.

## Abstract
A spherical lens 5 is fixed to the front end of a tubular housing 1 and an end part of a light conducting fibre 9 is fixed with its first end face 11 in the focal plane of the lens. The line through the centre 13 of the lens 5 and the middle of the first end face 11 is the optical axis 17 . The housing 1 with the lens 5 is placed against a seat 25 , which is formed as a cavity with a rotationally symmetrical surface, on whose axis of rotation 27 a light detector 31 is mounted, which is designed to determine deviations between the direction of a light beam coming from the lens and the direction of the axis of rotation. Near the second end face 45 of the fibre 9 light is injected into the fibre, and the rear end of the housing is displaced in two direction, x, y perpendicular to the optical axis, until the light beam emerging from the lens 5 coincides with the axis of rotation 27 . The lens 5 with the seating 25 thereby functions as a ball hinge. The outer surface of the housing 1 is now finish machined with a tool 49 that rotates around the axis of rotation 27 .
