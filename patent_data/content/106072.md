# HIGH VOLTAGE SCHOTTKY BARRIER DIODE

## Abstract
A Schottky barrier diode includes a voltage supporting layer of gallium arsenide with a dopant concentration below about 10ยนโถ impurity atoms per cubic centimeter, enabling it to support high voltage. The Schottky barrier diode attains nearly an ideal reverse breakdown voltage and has an extremely low reverse leakage current without the require ment of edge termination structure, such as a passivation layer or a guard ring.
