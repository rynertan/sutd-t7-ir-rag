# Acoustic transducer.

## Abstract
An acoustic transducer, comprising a transmitter 3 consisting of a plate of piezoelectric ceramic material comprising electrodes 7, 9 and an adaptation layer 5, 11 which comprises a receiver 5 consisting of a layer of piezoelectric or ferroelectric polymer material with electrodes 9, 11 . As a result, optimum operation of the transducer is possible during transmission as well as during reception.
