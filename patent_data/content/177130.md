# Passive infrared detector.

## Abstract
A passive infrared detector including an optical collector 1A releasably attached to a base 20 with a sensor 30 on which incident infrared radiation directed through the optical collector 1A is focused. The sensor 30 is held by a joint member 40 which is pivotally supported on the base 20 and to which said optical collector 1A is releasably attached by means of a magnet ring 5 , whereby the optical collector is rotatable together with the joint member 40 relative to the base 20 for adjustment of its angular position and the optical collector can be alone replaced as necessary without having to replace the base 20 , the sensor and its associated electric circuitry 31 .
