# HYDRAULICALLY DRIVEN OSCILLATING MECHANISM, PARTICULARLY FOR A FIRE FIGHTING MONITOR

## Abstract
In a mechanism to provide automatic traverse oscillation for a fire fighting monitor 1 water is tapped off from the main supply pipe 9 which feeds the monitor and passed to a Pelton wheel turbine 14. The runner of the turbine is connected via a gearbox 17 to a drive wheel 18, to which a crank arm 19 is pinned. The other end of the crank arm 19 is linked to a shaft 21, so that as the wheel 18 is driven to rotate by the turbine the shaft 21 is caused to oscillate. The shaft 21 is engageable through a concentric clutch assembly 22 with a drive gear 23 28 in mesh with a ring gear 24 keyed to the hollow axle 6 by which the monitor head 2 is both supported and fed with water from pipe 9. When the clutch 22 is engaged, therefore, the monitor head 2 is automatically oscillated to traverse its jet through a predetermined arc. The clutch 22 can be disengaged manually by lifting the cover 33 on the top of the assembly, thereby to interrupt the drive from the shaft 21 to the gear 23 28 via an associated socket member 25. The head 2 can then be rotated by hand to a new position and the clutch re engaged so that the head now oscillates in a new sector of the horizon. Likewise the clutch can be disengaged to permit manual override of the oscillating mechanism at any time.
