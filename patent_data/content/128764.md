# Radiation image signal compression method and apparatus.

## Abstract
In a system for compressing radiation image signals, code tables 4A for use in entropy encoding for signal compression are created and classified in accordance with combinations of human body portions of radiation images with image recording conditions thereof. The optimal table is selected from the clas sified tables in accordance with the combination of the human body portion of the radiation image with the image recording conditions thereof which are inputted from a keyboard 5 . Ra diation image signals obtained by reading out the radiation im age are compressed by use of the optimal table, thereby quickly achieving efficient signal compression.
