# SOLID ACID CATALYST IN PARTICULAR FOR ACCELERATING CHEMICAL REACTIONS

## Abstract
A solid acid catalyst comprises essentially hydrated niob ium oxide containing a phosphoric acid particularly on its sur face in an amount sufficient to increase surface acidity, to inhi bit crystallization of the niobium oxide and to retard loss in ca talytic activity following exposure to high temperature. The ca talyst can be prepared by treating hydrated niobium oxide Nb₂O₅.xH₂O or an anhydride thereof with a phosphoric acid. The catalyst is particularly useful in the hydration of ethylene to form ethanol.
