# NUCLEAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE APPARATUS

## Abstract
Inside the gradient coils in the magnet system of a nu clear magnetic resonance apparatus there is arranged a sleeve which forms a noise absorbing shield between the gradient coils and the measurement space in the magnet. The shield is preferably formed by an evacuatable space between the sleeve and a support for the gradient coils. This space is then provided with elastic vacuum seals at its axial ends.
