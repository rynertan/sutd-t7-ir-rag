# Surface treatment of metal.

## Abstract
A method of inhibiting corrosion of a metal surface comprises applying to the metal surface an organic solvent in which is dissolved a phosphate monoester of a hydroxyal kyl acrylate or a hydroxyalkyl alkylacrylate which phosphate monoester has the general formula, The solution may also contain a diester of a hydroxyalkyl acrylate, a diester of a hydroxyalkyl alkylacrylate, hydroxyal kyl acrylate or hydroxyalkyl alkylacrylate. The method may also improve the adhesive strength of a subsequently applied protective coating e.g. paint.
