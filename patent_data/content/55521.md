# Method of filling a groove in a semiconductor substrate.

## Abstract
A method for forming an isolation region on a semicon ductor substrate 11 which comprises steps of forming first a groove in said substrate 11 , filling the groove with a first insulating film 15 in a manner which may leave gaps between the walls of the groove and the sides of the first insulating film 15 , forming a second insulating film 16 on the surface of said substrate including said groove, and removing a surface layer of said second insulating film 16 thereby forming an isolation region in the groove filled completely with the first and second insulating films 15, 16 .
