# FUEL CONTROL SYSTEM FOR GAS TURBINE ENGINE

## Abstract
A fuel control system for a gas turbine engine of the kind having at least one compressor 12, 14 and turbine spool 20, 22 and a free turbine 24 , comprising a pneumatic fuel metering device 34 whose metering valve is controlled by a pneumatic mechanism as a function of the difference between a reference pressure Px and a modulated control pressure Py which can be varied either by a first governor 50 responsive to turbine speed Ng or by a second governor 48 responsive to free turbine speed Nf , said governors thus providing a parallel governing mode. According to this invention, at least one of said governors 48, 50 is an electronic control unit generating an electrical signal indicative of a desired engine output power, and there is provided an interface means 44, 46 converting said signal into a corresponding variation of the control pressure Py . For use particularly in control systems for helicopters and the like.
