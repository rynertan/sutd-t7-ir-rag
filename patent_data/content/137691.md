## Description
PRODUCTION OF IMMUNE INTERFERON AND ITS mRNA This invention relates to processes for producing immune interferon and its mRNA, and to homogeneous immune interferon IFN X . More particularly, one aspect of the invention relates to a process for the production of high yields if human IFN g from induced human leukocytes modulated with mezerein or 12,13 phorbol dibutyrate. Preferably, the leukocytes are induced by a calcium ionophore selected fromA 23187, ionomycin, and l,l dimethyl 6,6,7,7,8,8,8 heptafluoro 3,5 octanedione. Another aspect of this invention relates to IFNwhich has been purified to substantial homogeneity. A further aspect of this invention relates to a process for the recovery of IFN mRNA, and to a cloning process for the production of IFN Interferon was discovered by Isaacs and Lindenmann in 1957, who observed that fluids from virus infected cell cultures contained a protein which could react with normal cells to render them resistant to infection by a wide variety of viruses. In addition to potent antiviral effects, interferon possesses anticellular, immunoregulatory and antitumor activities. The use of interferon in the treatment of cancer and viral infections in animals has met with some successes, and consequently its use in man is of great interest. Interferons are classified into three major species designated alpha or leukocyte interferon IFN alpha , beta or fibroblast interferon IFN and gamma or immune interferon IFN . IFN alpha and IFNrare induced viruses or synthetic polynucleotides. IFN gamma has been induced in lymphocytes by specific antigens or by certain T cell mitogens. It is believed that protein mitogens cause cell membrane receptors to form clusters which are termed patches . Presumably, the patching event allows a rapid influx cf calcium into the ll which, for a reason not entirely understood, initiates production of IFN IFN g may be distinguished from the IFN CCand IFN ssspecies of interferon by its inability to be neutralized by antibodies directed against either IFN CCor IFN ss, and its ability to be neutralized by antibodies directed against IFN gamma .IFN gamma may also be characterized by the fact that its biological activity is largely destroyed by being placed in a low pH environment, such as pH 2, and also when brought into contact with sodium dodecyl sulfate. Interferon related research has primarily concentrated on the IFN alpha and INF ssspecies. For example, considerable work on producing IFN alpha has been done by Dr.Kari Cantell in Finland. See, Production and Preparation ofHuman Leukocyte Interferon , K.E. Morgensen and D. Cantell, 1Pharmac. Ther. C., 369 381, 1977. The amino acid sequences of IFN C7Pand IFN ss have recently been identified by protein sequence analyses and work on the sequences of their respective cloned complementary DNA. Furthermore, there is now evidence that multiple sub species of IFN alpha and IFNexist. Very little is known about the structure 6f IFNor its biological properties. It is now believed, however, that IFN K may be more active as a cell growth inhibitory agent, immunoregulatory agent and antitumore agent, and it may possess the ability to potentiate both the antiviral and anticellular effects of either IFN CSor IFN ss. Thus,IFN gamma may be greater interest than IFN alpha and IFN . A variety of T cell mitogenic proteins have been identified for inducing IFO g from unprimed lymphocytes.Some of the more commonly used proteins are plant lectins such as concanavalin A and phytohemagglutinin A, or other proteins known to be mitogenic such as staphylococcal enterotoxin A and staphylococcal protein A. An article, Human Immune Interferon Induction inLymphoid Cells by a Calcium Ionophore, by F. Dianzani et al, 29 Interferon and Immunity, 561 563, August 1980, described the use of the calcium ionophore A 23187 as an IFN K inducer. A 23187 is described im U.S. Patent No. 3,932,823. Calcium ionophore A 32187 is not a protein. It is believed that A 32187, due to its lipophilic properties and high affinity for calcium, permits a rapid influx of calcium across the cell membrane thereby simulating the patching mechanism of the protein inducers. However, using the Dianzani et al. procedure, the IFN gamma activity is barely perceptible only 10 100 units per ml. of IFN z activity has been observed.As used herein, a unit is equivalent to 50 inhibition of viral cytopathic effects. Comparison of titers among different laboratories is not readily made because there is no accepted international standard for IFN . This invention teaches a process for producing high yields of IFN g and its mRNA which is reliable, efficient and functional.It also discloses genetic engineering techniques for producinq clones which can express IFN g The present invention relates to a process for the production of IFN comprising incubating for a period of time at least sufficient for the production of IFN , a viable cell suspension which includes leukocytes, an inducer for production of IFN K , and a modulator for said inducer selected from mezerein or 12,13 phorbol butyrate, said inducer and said modulator being present in the suspension in amounts sufficient to stimulate production of IFN , separating the supernatatant from the cell suspension and purifying the IFN gamma by a adsorbing the IFN gamma onto a column containingControlled Pore Glass beads and eluting with ammonium sulfate b adsorbing the IFN gamma containing eluate of step a onto a column containing Concanavalin A Sepharose, lentil lectin Sepharose or pea lectin agarose and eluting with a buffer containing a sugar c adsorbing the IFN gamma containing eluate of step b onto a column containing Heparin Sepharose or ProcianRed agarose and eluting with a buffer containing a high salt content and d passing the IFN L containing eluate of step c through a gel filtration column equilibrated in high salt and recovering purified The improvement comprising dialyzing the partially purified interferon against a chemically compatible buffer and contacting the solution of dialyzed partially pure interferon with a column of cationic exchanger resin for a period of time sufficient to accomplish equilibrated adsorption of the interferon to the exchanger in the presence of a buffer at pH about 9.0 to 10.0, washing the resin having interferon adsorbed thereon from the soluble fraction with a buffered solution until the optical density of the eluate at 280 nm is about 0, eluting the adsorbed interferon with a desorbing buffer of about 10 30 mM tris HCl at pH of about 9 10 containing 50 mM Nail the step being performed prior to step d and after steps a , b , c . The leukocytes may originate from a variety of sources including human, monkey, sheep, cow, pig and chicken.Particularly, the viable cell suspension includes leukocytes, a modulator selected from the group consisting of mezerein or 12,13 phorbol dibutyrate, and an IFN z inducer. Preferably, the IFN inducer is a calcium ionophore selected from the group consisting of A 23187, ionomycin, or 2,2 dimethyl 6,6,7,7,8,8 ,8 heptafluoro 3,5 octanedione hereinafter FOD . At the end of the incubation period, both IFNand IFN z mRNA may be extracted from the cell suspension. The IFN gamma is found in the supernatant and may be purified to homogeneity by adsorbing and eluting the crude IFN through a series of columns. A technique for purifying IFN is disclosed in my U,S. Patent No. 4,482,026 which is incorporated herein by reference. The IFN J mRNA is contained in the cells. It is extracted from the cells by a process which generally involves first removing the large DNA strands and proteins from the lysed cells, and then separating the mRNA from other types ofRNA and small strands of DNA is a poly U column. The mRNA that contains high IFN g activity is selected by size fractionation. This mRNA is now useful for expressing IFN g in clones. The principle advantage of cloning is that by placing the DNA which codes for IFN g into a host cell, such as bacteria or yeast, there is a potential for harvesting enormous amounts of IFN g . Briefly, this is accomplished by adding the isolated mRNA to a viral enzyme, reverse transcriptase, which reads the mRNA code and transcribes a single stranded complementary DNA. Double stranded DNA is achieved in the presence of DNA polyerase or reverse transcriptase and is placed into a host cell,.such açs bacteria E. coli, by means of genetic engineering recombinant techniques such as described in U.S. Patent No. 4,237,224.For example, insertion of the double stranded DNA into the host cell is accomplished by first selecting a cloning vehicle, such as a plasmid, which is compatible with the host cell and carries a phenotypical trait, such as penicillin resistance. Enzymes which are capable of cleaving specific cites on the cloning vehicle remove a portion of the vehicle approximately the size of the DNA coding for IFN g to be inserted. The DNA and the cloning vehicle are joined together with DNA ligase. The recombinant cloning vehicle is then introduced into the host in the presence of calcium chloride by the process of transformation.Afterwards the cells that have taken up the recombinant cloning vehicle molecule, the transformants, are selected, usually by use of antibiotics, and thereafter selectively isolated by their ability to hybridize with mRNA from IFN g induced cells.These transformants are then screened for expression ofIFN 6 . The IFN g ds DNA from selected transformants are placed in optimal expressing vehicles for large scale production of IFN The calcium ionophores, A 23187 and ionomycin, are antibiotics produced by microorganisms. The calcium ionophore FOD is synthetic material, and it has been shown that its biological effects resemble those described forA 23187.The main difference between FOD and A 32187, for purposes of this invention, is that greater concentrations of FOD appear to be necessary to produce similar yields of IFN gamma However, there may prove to be no significant distinction in optimal concentrations of A 3287 and FOD upon discovery of a solvent for FOD which is capable of reducing FOD to its monomexic non mFcel ar form and is not cEtotoxic. Practically, the use of greater concentrations of FOD is irrelevant since FOD is inexpensive and readily available in large quantities. Mezerein, the modulator, is a poly cyclic C38H38010 hydrocarbon with molecular weight of 654. It is an extract from the plant Daphne mezereun L. Mezerein has been shown to be as effective a lymphocyte mitogen as the potent tumor promoting agent, 12 0 tetradecanoylphorbol 13 acetate TPA . Thus, its discovery as a potent modulator for IFN g inducers makes it extremely useful. The alternative modulator useful in this invention 12,13 phorbol dibutyrate, is a phorbol ester which, like mezerein, is a potent modulator for IFN g inducers. The combination of the modulator and the inducer produces significantly more titer of IFN J than were they used individually, and more than would be expected if the effects of the two were merely additive. It has also been demonstrated that IFN gamma inducers, particularly one of the calcium ionophores, in combination with a modulator stimulates production of higher immune IFN gamma titer than the unmodulated IFN 6 inducers, staphylococcal enterotoxin A, phytohemagglutinin A and concanavalin A. The combination of mezerein and calcium ionophore inducers, particularly A 32187, reliably and consistently produces high yields of IFNs g . Additionally, by virtue of the relatively low molecular weights oE calcium onophore and mezerein, their hydrophobicity, and in the case of A 23187, its high affinity for certain bivalent cations they bre easily removed from the IFS product. Thus, there is far less concern with toxicity of the mezerein calcium ionophore system than with the other known inducers which are all proteins and are difficult to remove from other proteins found in the cell suspension, In addition, the inducer proteins may tend to co purify with the IFN gamma thereby contaminating the final product, making it impractical for clinical use. Thus, the mezerein calcium ionophore system is particularly advantageous for production of human IFN g for use in clinical trials, and also for recovery of the mRNA from the incubated cell suspension for future cloning. The accompanying drawings will assist in understanding the invention disclosed herein. Figure 1 is a generalized flow chart of the various process steps. Figures 2 and 3 are dose curves associated with Example 4 herein.The Figure 1 flow chart is a diagrammatic aid for the specification and claims and does not fully disclose a 11 the features of this invention which are described in this specification. The flow chart describes the process for production of IFN gamma and its purification to homogeneity the process for production of mRNA useful for cloning IFN gamma and the process for producing clones capable of expressing IFN With reference to the Figure 1 flow chart, buffy coats are isolated from whole blood by centrifugation and then suspended in a culture medium containing antibiotics. Alternatively, the erythrocytes are removed from the buffy coats and the remaining leukocytes are suspended in the culture medium. The modulator and inducer are admixed with the suspension and conditioned for a short period. A nutrient sources is added and the cell suspension is incubated under either stationary or agitated conditions.The incubated cell suspension is then centrifuged to separate the supernatant from the cells. The supernatant contains the crude IFN g which is purified to homogeneity. The cells contain the IFN mRNA which is used in the cloning process. The cells are lysed and the IFN gamma mRNA is extracted by a process comprising removing the large DNA strands and proteins, passing the remaining RNA through a poly U column to remove rRNA and small strands of DNA, eluting mRNA from the column and size fractionating the mRNA.Samples from the various sizing fraction are assayed for their ability to code for IFN g by in vivo translation in frog oocytes. The fractions corLespóndSng to the highestIFN g activity are selected for cloning. The ds DNA to be inserted, in the cloning vehicle is prepared from the extracted mRNA in two stages. First the ss DNA complementary to the mRNA is synthesized in the presence of reverse transcriptase. This ss DNA acts as the template to synthesize its complementary ss DNA in the presence of reverse transcriptase or DNA polymerase, and through hydridization achieving the ds DNA. The ds DNA is made blunt ended and appropriate terminal codons are added.The ds DNA is then joined with a cleaved cloning vehicle with appropriate terminal codons in the presence of DNA ligase.This recombinant cloning vehicle is placed in the host cell by the transformation process. The resulting transformants are isolated by means of the phenotypical trait carried by the cloning vehicle. The transformants are further selected by their.ability for strong hybridization to labelled mRNA from IFN g induced cells and optionally followed by positive hybridization selection. The candidate transformants are screened in a translational system, preferrably, Xenopus iaevis oocytes.The IFN g ds DNA from these transformants may be removed and inserted into optimal expressing vehicles which may be grown for large scale production of IFN In accordance with the preferred embodiments of this invention, buffy coats containing human leukocytes are provided as a viable cell source for human IFN z production. Buffy coats may be obtained by a variety of standard clinical techniques, such as by leukoporesis or on a hemoetics machine. One suitable method involves collecting whole blood usually 100 ml. by venipuncture from healthy donors in acid citrate dextrose solution orin heparinized ontainers. The acid citrate dextrose solution and heparin are normal additives to blood units preventing coagulation of the blood cells upon standing. The whole blood it centrifuged and the plasma fraction removed. The layer immediately beneath the serum of the centrifuged material is the buffy coat. The buffy coat consists primarily of leukocytes and some erythrocytes, One component of the leukocytes are T cell lymphocytes. It is believed that these lymphocytes are responsible for production of IFN Another method of isolating the leukocytes is by the Ficoll Hypaque gradient method as described in A.Boyum, Isolation of Leukocytes from Human Blood , 21 Scand. J.Clin. Lab. Invest. Suppln. 31 50 1968 . A substantial portion of the cells derived from this technique are lymphocytes, of which the T cell originated lymphocytes are present. The remaining mononuclear leukocyte cells are cell lymphocytes, monocytes and null cells. In U S. P tent No. 4,376,821 a process was disclosed in which human peripheral blood was treated with a buffered ammonium chloride solution to lyse material. It has now been discovered that when the preferred inducers are used, yields of human IFN are improved up to five times if the buffy coat material is not pretreated with the ammonium chloride solution. In the preferred embodiment.buffy coat material is used directly in the modulation induction procedure of this invention. The buffy coat material is suspended in a culture medium, with about 1.0 X 106 to about 9 0 to 106 leukocyte cells ml. of cell suspension as the concentration range. The optimum concentration range is from about 4.0 X 106 to about 7.0 X 106 cells ml. The preferred concentration is 5.0 X 106 cells ml. Commercially available culture media which have been found to be especially suitable are RPMI 1640 available from GIBCO laboratories, Grand Island, New York, and when using the preferred inducers, Dulbecco s Minimal Essential Media DMEM available from Meloy Laboratories, Inc. Springfield,Virginia. In some cases, it is desirable to add antibiotics to the culture medium before suspending the buffy coats to prevent contaminating bacterial growth. Broad spectrum antibiotics such as 100 units of pennicilli per ml. culture medium, 100 ug. of streptomycein per ml. culture medium, or 100 ug. of gentamicin per ml. culture medium may be used.Although the inclusion of antibiotics in the culture medium inhibits bacterial growth, the antibiotics themselves are contaminants in the sense that they must be removed from the extracted interferon product. Even trace amounts of antibiotics, if not completely removed from the interferon product, may cause allergic reactions when administered to susceptible patients. A modulator selected from the group consisting of mezerein and 12,13 phorbol dibutyrate is added to the culture medium containing the suspended buffy coat material. These modulators are commercially available from CCR, Inc., EdenPrairie, Minnesota. The modulator may be added in a minimum amount of about 0.7 ng. ml. of cellssuspension. Tetpper limit does not appear to be critical because at optimal concentrations of modulator the yield of IFN plateaus.There may be a divergence in the optimal concentration of modulator among different preparations or batches this is likely due to the level of purity of the modulator in each batch. The purer the modulator, the less that is necessary to produce maximum yields of IFN g . The optimal amount of modulator to be used for a particular batch of modulator is preferably determined by constructing a calibration grid. See, e.g., Example 4, and Figure 3, This may be done by plotting a series of dose responses for varying concentrations of mezerein as a function of varying concentrations of the inducer. The optimal proportion of modulator to be included in the cell suspension is in the range of the first point of the plateau of the dose response curve e.g., dotted line segment A B of Figure 3 . Based on the calibration grids constructed for two separate batches of mezerein, the minimum concentration for mezerein to induce optimal quantities of IFN 1 varies between 7 ng. ml. and 30 ng. ml. Although it has been found that the concentration of mezerein required for optimal modulation of A 32187 may vary from batch to batch, neither the kinetics of IFNproduction nor the shape of the A 32187 dose response curve is altered. U. S. Patent No. 4,376,821 described introduction of calcium ionophore A 23187 and a modulator into the culture medium hat contains peripheral blood leukocytes. The amount of A 23187 perml. of cell suspension was in the range of between about 0.1 10.0 ug. ml. and preferably 0.102.0 ug. ml. Thereafter, the mixture was incubated for between about 12 hours and 7 days at about 370C. while gently stirring the culture spin culture at a rate of about 10 The The spin culture suSpension was maintained under a blanket of air CO2, which can be maintained by feeding co2 into the suspension through micron pore size air stones to distribute the gas.Thus a uniform CO2 mixture of about 5 was maintained at all times. It has now been found that A 23187 may very effectively be used within the preferred proportional range of 0.15 0.8 pg. imi. of cell suspension under stationary culture conditions during the incubation period. Preferably,A 23187 in the amount of between 0.25 0.6 ug. ml. is used.Within this range, stationary cultures have occasionally yielded 2 3 times higher titers of IFN 6 than when the cultures are agitated. The incubation temperature should remain at about body temperature, i.e., 370C. The temperature may be varied to the extent the cells remain viable, and within the range of viability, there appears to be a relationship between temperature and incubation time higher temperatures appear to require shorter incubation times. Induction of IFN g has been observed after about 12 hours of incubation, and induction lasts until the cells are no longer viable, up to as long as about 12 days. Three to 4 days is the preferred incubation period on the basis of maximal yield per unit of time. It has been demonstrated that there is an initial phase of production between about 20 hours and 40 hours. this is followed by a loss of activity and then a second phase of production. The greatly improved yield of IFN g resulting from the stat o lary culture incubation and the smaller preferred proportion of A 23187 is thought to be due to the availability ofdirzct cell contact of adjacent cells throughout the stationary incubation period, rather than continual random cell contact which occurs when the cell suspension is agitated during the incubation period. In any event, increased yields of up to 3 times have been occasionally noted. In addition to increased yields, the stationary culture incubation process also permits considerably smaller batches to be made that yield the same proportion of IFNas when the larger batch is used in the spinner culture incubation process. As a consequence, there is a significant reduction in the amount of contaminants that co reside with the IFN g . Moreover, there is a significant cost savings by using less A 32187. Thus, without reducing the overall yield, the efficiency of the earlier process is materially improved. A 23187 alone will induce cells to produce barely detectable amounts of human IFN 6. By a mechanism which is not entirely understood, the addition of a modulator appears to increase the number of cells capable of responding to A 23187, to increase the number of cells capable of responding to A 23187, and thus greatly enhancing the,yield of IFN 6 . For instance, in reproduction of the Dianzani et al. article calcium ionophore A 23187, was employed without a modulator , only 10 100 units of aqtiviral activity per ml.was measured. In contrast, the combination of mezerein with an inducer has consistently induced cells to increased yields of IFN X . Particularly, mezerein in combination withA 23187 may produce IFN in the range of up to 400,000 and more units of anti viral activity per ml. In specific experiments yields of up to 80,000 and more units per ml have leen obtained. An alternative calcium ionophore which is a practical and an effective inducer is 2,2 dimethyl 6 , ,7,7,8,8,8 heptafluoro 3,5 octanedione FOD . It is commercially available from the Aldrich Chemical Company, catalog i17,516 1. FOD has been demonstrated to closely resemble calcium ionophore A 23187 in its effects on biological systems. A Synthetic Ionophore For Ca2 Studies With Model and Biological Systems , Gomperts et al., 117 Eur. J. Biochem., pp. 559 56.2, 1981 . Ionomycin is also a potent IFN inducer. It is a calcium ionophore available from Squibb, Inc. Experiments using FOD as an inducer for IFNproduction ranging from 30 300 ug. ml. of cell suspension have been conducted. While FOD has been added at concentrations 100 1,000 times greater than A 23187 it is believed that the greater FOD concentration requirement may be due to its being in a micellar state. Use of a solvent for FOD which is capable of reducing it to its monomeric non micellar form and which is not cytotoxic will eliminate this variance in concentrations between the two calcium ionophores. In the presence of such a solvent the minimum concentration proportion for FOD might be as low as .10 g. ml. of cell suspension. As a practical matter the high concentrations of FOD are not significant because it is inexpensive and readily available in large quantities. It should be noted that the order in which the modulator and calcium ionophore inducer are included in the cell suspension is not controlling. They may be added in any order, or simultaneously. However, when the inducer is a protein it should be added at about 2 hours after the modulator. It has also been found that IFN g yield is further increased if a nutrient source such as a protein source, for example, fetal calf serum or calf seruzn is adored to the cell suspension in an amount sufficient to keep the cells alive.That amount is generally about 3 to about 15 at final concentration and, preferably fom about 3 to 10 volume volume serum cell suspension. It is preferable to add the nutrient source after the cell suspension has been conditioned for about 2 6 hours at about body temperature. It is essential to the invention that the cells remain viable during incubation. Thus, the appropriate amount of cell suspension to be included in a culture container is determined by the capacity of that particular container such that a suitable volume of air CO2 makes contact with the cell suspension to maintain viability over the incubation period. Conditions must be such that a dynamic exchange of CO2 and other volatile metabolites of the cell suspension can be established between the suspension media and the air volume. Suitably, relatively shallow apparatus, with liquid depths of such as approximately 3mm.in deep trays or 5 10 mm. in tissue culture tubes are used to carry the stationary culture during incubation, thereby providing a large surface area to volume ratio. It is desirable to initiate the incubation period with a pH such that the cells will remain viable. For example, the culture may be initially buffered to a pH of about 7.0 7.9, preferably about 7.2 7.4. After the cell culture suspension has incubated for a period of time sufficient to produce desired yields of crude IFN g , the cells are separated from the supernatant, for example, by centrifugation, at 1000 3000 X g, depending on the culture volume, for the necessary time, e.g., 10 60 minutes, at 40C. The yields of crude IFN g that result from the crude cell suspensions may contain up to 400,000 units and more IFN activity per ml. cell suspension. The residual cells can be used for reinducing IFN g production, or for recovery of IFN g mRNA, or both. The supernatant containing the crude IFN may be stored at 40C. A partial purification process for crude IFN g is described in, Partial Purification and Characterization ofHuman immune Interferon , Yip et al., 78 Proc. Natl. Acad.Sci. U.S.A. No. 3, 1601 05, 1981 . A technique for purifying IFN X is disclosed inSerial No. 293,775. Generally, the process concerns passing the crude IFN g through 4 columns. One column containsControlled Pore Glass beads. The crude IFN g is adsorbed onto the column and eluted with ammonium sulfate. A second column contains either Concanavalin A Sepharose, lentil lectin Sepharose or pea lectin ag,arose. The IFN z is adsorbed onto this column and then eluted with a buffer containing sugar. A third column contains Heparin Sepharose or Procian Red agarose. The IFN is adsorbed onto this column and eluted with a salt buffer. The final column is a ge filtration column equilibrated in high salt. More specifically, the crude IFN is contacted with Controlled Pore Glass beads in a chromatographic column for a period of time sufficient to accomplish equilibrated adsorption of the crude IFN the beads in the presence of a neutral pH buffer such as phosphate buffered saline PBS at about pH 7.2. If the crude IFN is produced from cell suspensions containing red blood cells, then before contacting the crude IFN 6 to the CPG beads tris hydroxymethyl amino methane is added to bring the concentration to 500 mM and buffered to a pH of 9.5 to 9.7.The glass beads are then washed with a chemically compatible buffer such as an aqueous solution containing tris hydroxymethyl amino methane at a concentration of 500 mM, and buffered to about pH 9.5, to remove the unbound contaminant until the optical density of the eluate at 280 nm. is about 0. The glass beads having IFN adsorbed thereon are next washed with a neutral pH buffer solution until the optical density at 280 nm. is about 0, and then adsorbed IFN is eluted from the glass beads with an aqueous solution of 2M ammonium sulfate at pH about 9.0.Optionally, the above pH adjustment step may be applied to the crude IFN de regardless of whether or not red cells are present. This eluate is then passed through a column packed with an adsorbent selected from the group consisting of Concanavalin A Sepharose, lentil lectin Sepharose and pea lectin agarsoe for the period of time sufficient to accomplish equilibrated adsorption of the IFN g to the adsorbent in the presence of a neutral pH buffer such as phosphate buffered saline. The adsorbent having IFNadsorbed thereon is washed with ammonium sulfate until the optical density of the eluate at 280 nm. is about 0. The adsorbent is then washed with a phosphate buffered saline until the optical density of the eluate at 280 nm. is about 0. Elution of the adsorbed IFN J is then carried out with a phosphate buffered saline containing from 0.1 M to 2.0 M alpha methyl D mannoside or l methyl D glucoside. The IFN 6 eluate is then contacted withHeparin Sepharose or Procian Red agarose and equilibrated in a neutral pH buffered solution. The IFN g is washed with a neutral pH buffered solution such as PBS containing about 1 M alpha methyl D mannoside or l methyl D glucoside to remove the unbound material until the optical density of the eluate at 280 nm. is about 0. Again, the adsorbent is washed with a neutral pH buffered solution until the optical density is about 0 to remove some of the bound material. The adsorbedIFN z is eluted with a second neutral pH buffered solution containing a high concentration of salt. The IFN may be adsorbed and eluted in these three columns in any order. The IFN off may be further purified by subjecting the elution fraction to gel filtration treatment equilibrated in a neutral pH buffered solution containing a high concentration of salt, and then eluting with the same equilibrating buffer. The solutes within the elution fractions may be separated according to their molecular weights. Analysis of the resulting eluate material from the gel filtration column that is passed through SDS PAGE demonstrated 4 bands. These are at approximately 20,000 daltons, 25,000 daltons, 47,000 daltons, 63,000 daltons. The molecular weight measurements are subject to an accuracy of about 3,000 daltons. An amino acid analyses on each band suggested that the 25,000 63,000 dalton bands have essentially the same amino acid contents, and it is thereupon concluded that the 47,000 and 63,000 bands represent multiples, i.e., dimers and trimers of the 25,000 dalton band.The 25,000 63,000 dalton bands represent the homogeneous species IFN 6 1 Biological activity assays indicated that the 25,000 and 47,000 dalton bands possessIFN activity the 63,000 dalton band IFN g will possess biological activity, but this has not yet been confirmed. The 20,000 dalton band represents the homogeneous species IFN 2 since its amino acid analysis suggests it is different from that of the 25,000 63,000 dalton bands.The 20,000 dalton band IFN g will possess biological activity, but this has not yet been confirmed. Alternatively, the IFN may be purified as described in commonly assigned U.S. application Serial No.437,660, filed October 29, 1982, of the same inventive entity incorporated herein by reference. The procedure is outlined in Example 9 below. The homogeneous IFN prepared by either method is particularly useful for physiochemoa l characterization structure studies, antibody production, and clinical application. After incubating the cell suspension for up to 3 days, the mRNA may be extracted from th cells. It is believed that after 3 days enzymes start digesting the mRNA.First, the cells are lysed and the large contaminants removed. For example, the cells are isolated by centrifugation and then lysed with sodium acetate and SDS or in a guanidine thiocyanate solution. Large strands of DNA and proteins are removed with phenol extraction or by centrifugation in cesium chloride in a cellulose nitrate tube. The remaining mRNA pellet is precipitated in ethanol and then resuspended in à salt buffer To further remove DNA and rRNA the suspension is bound to a column containing poly U sepharose and washed with a buffer. The mRNA is eluted with formamide and size fractionated on sucrose gradients.Samples from the fractions are injected in cells capable of translating IFN mRNA, such as Xenopus laevis oocytes.After the oocytes have had sufficient time to produce the IFN z , the IFN g activity is measured. The fractions corresponding to the highest IFN elative to RNA are selected for cloning. The fractions containing high IFN 6 activity are then added to reverse transcriptase. This enzyme reads the mRNA code and transcribes its single stranded complementaryDNA. Reverse transcriptase or DNA polymerase is added to achieve the double stranded DNA. Alternatively, the isolation of IFN mRNA may be effected as provided inExample 8 below. This double stranded DNA may be placed into a host cell, such as the bacteria E. coli, by relying on general genetic engineering recombinant DNA techniques such as described in the summary. The preferred embodiments of this invention are further illustrated by the examples which follow. EXAMPLE 1 production of Crude IFN Removed Erythrocytes SpinCultures The red blood cells contained in buffy coats were lysed with 7 volumes of 0.83 weight volume buffered ammonium chloride and immediately centrifuged at approximately 25 X g for 20 minutes to separate the lysed red blood cells from the buffy coat containing the leukocytes.The leukocytes were suspended at about 5.0 x 106 cells per ml. in DMEM medium Meloy . Mezerein, the modulator, at a final concentration of about 7 ng. ml. of cell suspension and the calcium ionophore A 23187, at a final concentration of about 2.0 ug. ml. of cell suspension were admixed with the leukocytes and medium to form the cell suspension. The cell suspension was conditioned for 2 hours at 370C. The fetal calf serum was then added until the fetal calf serum in the culture reached 10 . The culture was incubated for 72 hours at 370C. in a gently stirred container. After incubation the culture crude IFN was harvested by centrifugation at 2620 X g at 40C. for 20 minutes. The supernatant containing crudeIFN 6 was separated from the cells and particulate material. EXAMPLE 2Dose Response for A 32187 IFN g production from human leukocytes as a function of varying A 23187 concentrations modulated by mezerein at a concentration of 7 ng. ml. is shown in the dose response data shown in Table.I. The mezerein was prepared from a single batch received from CCR, Inc. The IFN was prepared under stationary incubation conditions See Example 4. . l TABLE IA 23187 Added ug. ml IFN K Titer Units ml. 0.01 30 0.05 30 0.10 30 0.15 1200 0.20 360 0.25 720 0.50 720 1.0 120 10.0 30 The optimum yield of IFN was between about 0.15 to 1.0 ug. ml. of A 23187 for this particular batch of mezerein. Table I titers of IFN g were measured in a semi micro c.p.e. inhibition assay using WISH cells as the indicator cells and Vesicular Stomatitis Virus VSV as the challenge virus. Significantly higher titers of IFN were measured when the challenge virus encephalomyocarditis virus EMC was used See Example 5. EMC is more sensitive to the anti viral effects of IFN EXAMPLE 3Modulated A 32187 Verses Unmodulated Protein Inducers The human IFN z modulated by mezerein and induced by A 23187, as in Example 1, was compared to IFNproduction induced by optimum concentration of staphylococcal enterotoxin A SEA , phytohemagglutinin P PHA P and concanavalin A Con A , without a modulator. Leukocyte cultures 5 X 106 cells ml. DMEM medium , SEA, PHA P andCon A. Nodulated A 23187 induced 2 4, 5 10 and 10 20 times, respectively, more IFN K than the unmodulated proteins. Virtually all of the detectable interferon of Examples 1, 2 and 3 were IFN g . Treatment at pH 2 resulted in 99 loss of activity in 1 hour, whereas control human IFN d was on .y slightly affected. Antibodies to IFN had little effect IFN K , whereas such antibodies completely neutralized the antiviral effect of IFN . Furthermore, the IFN was not active on bovine cells, and it demonstrated a different chromatographic profile when compared to human IFN . EXAMPLE 4Production of CrudeIFN Buff Coats Sta tionar Culture Whole blood, approximately 100 mi. volumes, was collected by venipuncture from healthy human donors in acid citrate dextrose solution. The whole blood was centrifuged and the plasma faction removed. The, buffy coat material was suspended at about 5.0 X 106 leukocyte cells per ml. in DMEM medium Meloy . Stock solutions of A 23187. and mezerein were prepared in DMSO at concentrations of 50 mg. ml. and lmg. ml., respectively. Working solutions were then prepared in DMEM. Mezerein, at a final concentration of at about 70 ng. ml. of culture, and A 23187, at a final concentration of 0.5 ug. ml., were added to the leukocyte and medium to form the cell suspension.The mezerein used in this Example was from a different batch than the mezerein used in Example 1, 2 and 3. Upon constructing calibration grids using mezerein in 10 ng. ml. increments ranging from 10 ng. ml. to 100 ng. ml. and A 23187 in varying concentrations ranging from .05 ug. ml. to 2 ug. ml. it was determined that 30 ng. ml. of cell suspension was the optimal concentration of mezerein for this batch. 30 ng. ml. corresponds to the first point of the plateau e.g., dotted line segment A B of Figure 3 of the dose response curve. 70 ug. ml. was used merely as a safety margin. A dose response curve of A 23187 in 70 ng. ml. of mezerein is shown in Figure 2. A dose response curve for mezerein in .5 ug. ml. ofA 23187 is shown in Figure 3. The plateau is determined by the average of the dose response points beginning with the point corresponding to the first significant production ofIFN g . In this case that point was approximately 32 X times of IFN X activity. The cultures were then poured into tissue culture tubes in which the depth of the culture was approximately 10 mm. and were then conditioned for 2 hours at 370C. Fetal calf serum was then added until the fetal calf serum in the cell suspension reached 10 . The cell suspension was then incubated for 3 days at 37 C. under stationary conditions and under a air CO2 blanket containing 5 CO2. At the end of the incubation period the cultures crude IFN were harvested by centrifugation at 1000 X g at 40C. for 60 minutes. The supernatant containing crude IFN d was separated from the cells and particulate material. EXAMPLE 5Yield of Crude A sample of the IFN g of Example 4 was titrated in a semi micro c.p.e. inhibition assay using WISH cells as the indicator cells and encephalomyocarditis virus EF C as the challenge virus. IFN was approximately 30 x 10 40 x 10 units ml. Virtually all of the detectable interferon in this system was IFN 6 . Treàtment at pH 2 resulted in 99 loss of activity in 1 hour, whereas.control human IFN was only slightly affected. Antibodies to IFN had little effect onIFN , whereas such antibodies completely neutralized the antiviral effect of IFN . Furthermore, the IFN was not active on bovine cells, and it demonstrated a different chromatographic profile when compared to human IFN . Musing the method of Example 4 and EMC as the challenge virus, IFN titers may range from about 8000 units ml. to about 400,000 units ml. and more and have ranged from about 8,000 units ml to about 80,000 units ml and EXAMPLE 6Purification to Homogeneity The following solutions were prepared solution of 500 mM tris hydroxymethyl amino methane at pH 9.6, then add 12N HCl to bring pH to 9.5, referred to as tris solution of 2M ammonium sulfate at pH 9.0 w N 140H neutral pH buffered solution of phosphate buffered saline PBS at pH 7.2 having a 1M solution of alpha methyl D mannoside and phosphate buffered saline solution PBS at pH 7.2 containing 2M sodium chloride. The following columns were prepared 2.6 cm. X 30 cm. chromatographic column was loaded with Controlled PoreGlass beads CPG about 160 ml. bed volume 1.6 cm. X 16 cm. chromatographic column was loaded with ConcanavalinA Sepharose Con A about 32 ml. bed volume and, a 1.6 cm. X 8 cm. chromatographic column was loaded withHeparin Sepharose H S about 16ml. bed volume . These three columns were equilibrated with phosphate buffered saline. A solution of the centrifuged crude IFN was adjusted to 500 mM with powdered tris, the pH adjusted to 9.5 with 12N HC1 and recentrifuged. The adjusted crude IFNwas loaded onto the CPG column at a flow rate of about 500 ml. hr. about 94 ml. cm.2 hr. . The column was monitored with a UV monitor at 2.0 AU and the unbound material collected into a beaker.The CPG column was washed with a 500 mM tris solution, pH 9.5, until the optical density or280 was 0. The column was monitored at 2.0 AU and the unbound material collected. The column was washed with PBS until Or280 returned to the baseline. Flow rate 80 ml. hr. overnight . The eluted material was collected into a second beaker. The CPG column, was eluted with 2M ammonium sulfate at pH 9.0 at a flow rate of 24 ml. hr., and 10 ml.fractions were collected. When the second peak began to appear on the monitor, the inlet of the Con A column was connected into the outlet of the monitor and the outlet of the Con A column into the fraction collector. The CPG column eluted onto the Con A column at a flow rate of 24 ml. hr. 12 ml. cm.2 hr. through Con A The column was monitored as above until the OD280 reached baseline. The CPG column was disconnected from the monitor and the monitor connected to the Con A column. The Con A column was washed with PBS until OD280 returned to the baseline. The flow rates and collections were monitored as above. The inlet of the H S column was connected to the outlet of the monitor and the outlet of the H S to the fraction collector. The Con A column was eluted with the PBS sugar solution. The collection was monitored as above until the OD280 returned to baseline. The Con A column was disconnected from the monitor and the H S connected to the monitor. The H S column was washed with PBS until OD280 returned to the baseline. The flow rate and collection were monitored as above. The H S column was eluted with 2M NaCl in PBS, pH 7.2 until OD280 returned to the baseline. The flow rate was monitored as above and 3 ml. fractions were collected. The H S peak fractions were selected by OD280, and then pooled. The pooled material was loaded onto the drained bed of the first P 100 column at 20 ml. hr. by gravity about 80 bed height pressure head . After the sample was loaded, the sides of column were washed with 2M NaCl in PBS, pH 7.2. The f ow was stopped and the column topped off with 2M NaC1 PBS.The flow was then opened and the column was run at 24 ml. hr.in PBS, pH 7.2 with 2M NaCl The system was monitored at 0.5AU and 10 ml. fractions were collected. EXAMPLE 7Yield of Pure IFN The results in Table II show the degree of purification and recovery of human IFN 6 when purified by the sequential purification techniques described above.

The bands have a molecular weight 20,000 daltons, 25,000 daltons, 47,000 daltons and 63,000 daltons, 3,000 daltons. A sample of purified IFN prepared by a process such as inExample 6 was passed through a denturing gel system to separate the IFN g into bands the bands were then cut out and confirmed for homogeneity. These bands were subject to an amino acid analysis. The amino acid analysis was run on a 20,000 dalton band, two 25,000 dalton bands one band had a molecular weight of 25,000 daltons and the other had a molecular weight of 28,000 daltons , a 45,000 dalton band and a 66,000 dalton band. The individual protein bands were hydrolyzed into their separate amino acids. Each band was then run through aDurham Amino Acid Analyzer which separated the amino acids and quantitively measured the amino acid residues per protein. Comparison of the ratio of the relative peak heights between amino acids for the 25,000, 28,000, 45,000 and 66,000 dalton bands were sufficiently similar to conclude that these bands represent the same protein, and that the 45,000 dalton band is a dimer and the 66,000 dalton band is a, trimer of the 25,000 dalton band. Comparison of the ratio of the relative peak heights between amino acids for the dalton band and the 25,000 dalton band were sufficiently different to conclude the 20,000 dalton band represents a different species ofIFN The purified IFN g is shown to consist of two homogeneous species, namely IFN g 1 MW about 25,000 daltons and its dimer and trimer , and IFN g 2 MW about 20,000 daltons . The following Table III shows the number of amino acid residues per IFN z protein molecule. This Table is based on the results of a run through the amino acid analyzer for each band.

EXAMPLE 8Isolation of IFN t mRNA The cells, which remained after the supernatant containing the crude IFN z of Example 4 was separated, were used in this Example. The cells were centrifuged in a Ficoll Hypaque density gradient to isolate viable lymphocytes. The lymphocytes were lysed by dissolving them in 5 10 times their volume in a solution of 4.2 X guanidine thiocyanate, 25 mM sodium citrate, pH 7.0, 0.1 M 2 mercaptoethanol, 0.5 sarkosyl and 0.18 antifoam A. The solution was then homogenized on a sonic blender for one minute to reduce the viscosity by breaking up DNA strands.Twenty ml. of the solution was layered over 15 ml. of 5.7 M cesium chloride in 0.01 M EDTA in a SW27 cellulose nitrate centrifuge tube, and centrifuged for 72 hours at 22,000 rpm at 150C. After aspirating the guanidinium thocyanate solution and decanting the cesium chloride solution, the remaining RNA pellet was rinsed in 500 1. of cold 70 ethanol to remove excess salt.The mRNA was dissolved in a solution of 0.01 M tris HCl, pH 7.4 and 0.001 M EDTA, and then precipitated overnight by making the solution 70 ethanol. The ethanol was decanted and the remaining RNA pellet air dried and suspended in a salt buffer. The mRNA was bound to a column of poly U Sepharose 4B by passing the mRNA over the column in a solution containing 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 3 mM EDTA, pH 7.4, 0.5 SDS and 300 mM NaCl. After rinsing the unbound RNA from the column, the poly A containing mRNA was eluted from the column in a solution containing 2.5 mM EDTA, pH 7.4, 1.0 mMHEPES, pH 7.4 and 70 deionized formamide maintained at 55 to 650C. The mRNA was precipitated in 70 ethanol two times and dissolved in 0.01 M tris HCl, pH 7.4 and 0.001 MEDTA.The mRNA was then size fractionated over a 5 29.9 isokinetic sucrose gradient in a SW41 rotor by centrifuging 27,000 rpm for 17 hours. Twenty nine fractions were collected from the gradient and samples from selected fractions were assayed for their ability to produce IFN g inXenopus laevis oocytes. IFN 6 mRNA activity of selected fractions collected in Example 8, is shown in Table IV.

Construction and Selection of Transformant Single stranded cDNA was transcribed from the above all Fraction in the presence of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase and a fourfold weight excess of oligo dT primer to mRNA. Double stranded cDNA was transcribed from a ss cDNA template with reverse transcriptase. The ds cDNA was made blunt ended by incubation with S1 nuclease.The reaction mixture consisted of 0.2 M sodium acetate pH 4,,.5, 0.4 M sodium chloride, 2.5 mM zinc sulfate and 1 5 units of S1 nuclease per ng. of ds cDNA in final reaction volume of 100 pal. The ds cDNA was incubated at 370C. for 1 hr., extracted with phenol chloroform, ethanol precipitated, and then subjected to size fractionation by electrophoresis on an 8 polyadrylamide gel. Reaction products with a length of 300 base pairs or longer were eluted, dialyzed against H2 0 and lyophilizedTerminal transferase was employed to add approximate 30 dCMP residues to the ds cDNA 3 termini. About 15 residues of dCMP were added in a similar reaction to the plasmid pBR322 that had been previously cleaved by PstI restriction endonuclease.Equimolar amounts of dC tailed ds cDNA and dG tailed plasmid were annelaed in 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM tris HCl pH 7.6 and 1 mMEDTA at a final DNA concentration of 10 ig. ml. The annelaing mixture was placed at 750C. and the temperature was lowered to OOC. over a 5 hr. time period. Transformation ofE. coli RR1 was carried out in the presence of calcium chloride. Transformants were selected by growth on tetracycline. Transformants Screened for IFN K cDNA Clones s Transformants were inoculated into individual wells of 96 well microtiter plates, grown to mid log phase, adjusted to 8 dimethyl sulfoxide, and then maintained as frozen stocks at 700C. Transformants were screened by growing the bacteria on replicate nitrocellulose filters using a 96 prong inoculating apparatus. Filters were hybridized with 32P labeled ss cDNAs synthesized from mRNA isolated from normal and IFN z induced human buffy coat cells. The filters were then washed, dried, and autoradiographed. Colonies that showed a strong hydridization signal with induced cDNA, and a weak hybridization signal with normal cDNA were selected for further analysis. Plasmid DNA was isolated, cleaved with restriction endonuclease PstI and the cleavage fragments separated by electrophoresis in horizontal 1.5 agarose gels.Plasmids containing large ds cDNA inserts were selected for further analysis. Optionally, following the differential screening and the plasmid DNA isolation steps above, DNA clones which code for INF mRNA specifically may be identified by pbsitive hybridization selection. DNA from a clone displaying a strong differential hybridization signal is immobilized on nitrocellulose filters as follows. Between 5 and 10 ug of DNA is adjusted to 0.2N NH4OH and 2M NaC1 in a small volume 100 ul and briefly heated to 1000C to totally denature the DNA. The DNA is immediately spotted onto a small piece of nitrocellulose filter paper. The filter is first air dried and then the DNA is covalently attached to the filter by heating at 800C for two hours.The filter is incubated in a small volume of 70 v v formamide, 0.3M Nail, 10 mM Hepes pH 7.5 , 0.28 SDS and 5 mM EDTA for 5 min at 47 C. The hybridization between the specific cDNA clone and 10 20 jig of unlabeled IFN g. mRNA is carried out for three hours at 470C in essentially the same buffer. The unreacted mRNA is then removed by washing five times at 470C in a solution of 0.75 mM NaC1, 7.5 mM sodium citrate pH 7.4 and 0.5 SDS.The mRNA complimentary to the cDNA is then eluted by two successive 10 min incubations at 470C in 90 v v formamide in 0.1 BUDS, 10 mM Hepes pH 7.5 , 1 mM EDTA and 33 Xg ml of carrier tRNA 9to aid in precipitation of the specific mRNA . The RNA is precipitated at least two timeswith ethanol and then translated in an in vitro or in vivo translating system. The protein encoded for by the IFN K mRNA can be identified by immunoprecipitation antisera toIFN To further confirm the identity of the candidateIFN z plasmids, a partial nucleotide sequence of the ds cDNA insert are determined. DNA inserts are labeled at the 3 end with 32P cordecypin and then subjected to DNA sequence analysis.Expression of IFN 6 High level expression of IFN K in bacterial cells, is obtained when the ds cDNA is cloned in a generalized expression vector which contains the E. coli trp promoter operator region. Additional expression vectors used include pBR322 vectors into which a synthetic ribosome binding site has been inserted into the ss lactamase gene. High level of expression of IFN gamma in yeast is obtained when the ds cDNA is inserted into an appropriate site in the yeast 2 circle to bring expression of IFN directly under the control of the 2 promoter function. TheIFN ds cDNA are also inserted into yeast DNA in such a fashion that expression of the IFN gene comes under the control of a derepressible yeast enzyme such as acid phosphate gene, pho E. High levels of expression of, interferon protein are obtained by inserting this entire construction into the free replicating yeast 2 X circle. Expression of IFN in mammalian cells is obtained when the ds cDNA insert is placed under the control of theSV40 early and late promoters. The recombinant DNA is used to transfect mammalian cells in order to obtain appropriate.post translational modification. EXAMPLE 9 This example presents the analysis of IFN after purification according to method described in the inventor sU.S. Application No. 437,660. Briefly, the purification was carried as follows A solution of centrifuged crude immune interferon was adjusted to 500 m with powdered Tris and the pH adjusted to 9.5 with 12N HC1. The adjusted crude interferon was loaded onto a Controlled Pore Glass Bead CPG column at a flow rate of 500 ml hr 94 ml cmê hr . The column was monitored at 2.OAU and the unbound material collected into a beaker. The CPG column was washed with a 500 mM Tris solution, pH 9.5, until the optical density OD280 was 0. The column was monitored at 2.0 AU and the unbound material collected.THe column is washed with phosphate buffered saline PBS until until OD280 returns to baseline. Flow rate 80 ml hr overnight . The eluted material is collected into a second beaker. The CPG column was eluted with 2M ammonium sulfate at pH 9.0 at a flow rate of 24 ml hr, and 10 ml fractions were collected. When second peak began to appear, the inlet of a Concanavalin A Sepharose Con A column was connected into the outlet of the monitor and the outlet of the Con A column into the fraction collector. The CPG column eluted onto the Con A column at a flow rate of 24 ml hr 12 cm2 hr thru Con A . The column was monitored as above and 10 ml fractions collected until the OD280 reached the baseline. The CPG column was disconnected from the monitor and the monitor connected to the Con A column. The Con A column was washed with PBS until OD280 returned to baseline. The flow rates and collections were monitored as above. The inlet of a Heparin Sepharose H S column, equilibrated in 20 mM phosphate buffer PB ,was connected to the outlet of the monitor and the outlet of the H S to the fraction collector. The Con A column was eluted with the PBS sugar solution. The flow rate and collect were monitored as above until the OD280 returned to baseline. The Con A column was disconnected from the monitor and the H S connected to the monitor. The H S column was washed with PB until OD280 returned to baseline. The column was then washed with a neutral pH buffer containing a physiological concentration of sodium chloride PBS until the 0D280 returned to baseline. The flow rate and collection were monitored as above. The H S column was eluted with 2M NaCl in PBS, pH 7.2 until OD280 returned to baseline. The flow rate monitored as above and 3 ml fractions were collected. The H S peak fractions were selected by D280 then collected and pooled. The pooled material was exhaustively dialyzed twice against 10 mM Tris HCl, pH 9.5. This material was then loaded onto the carboxymethyl agarose CM A column equilibrated in the same buffer. After the material was loaded, the column was washed with the same buffer until the OD280 returned to baseline. The interferon was then eluted off the column in an ascending fashion with 20 mM tris HCl, pH 9.5 containing 50 mM sodium chloride. The pooled material was loaded onto the drained bed of the first of two gel filtration columns 26 X 94cm , containing AcA54 900ml bed volume equilibrated with 2M NaCl in PBS and hooked up in series, at 20 ml hr by gravity 80 bed height pressure head . After sample was loaded, the sides of column were washed with 2M NaCI in PBS, pH 7.2. The flow was stopped and the column topped off with PBS. The flow was then opened and the column run at 24 ml hr in PBS pH 7.2 with 2M NaCl. The system was monitored at 0.5AU and 10 ml. fractions were collected. The results in Table I show the degree of purification and recovery of human immune interferon when purified by the sequential purification techniques described above.

By use of monoclonal antibodies directed against IFN,j and g it was determined that 1 the major band which migrated at a rate corresponding to 26,000 i 3,000 daltons and the minor bands which migrated at 22,000 3,000 daltons were IFN 2 the preparation is about 90 92 pure i.e., substantially homoneneous and 3 the specific activity of the preparation is approximately 2.8x108 Units mg. The high molecular bands may also represent IFN species however this has not be confimed. The bands corresponding to the 22K and 26K species were cut out and subjected to amino acid analysis in a Durham AminoAcid Analyzer. The results of the analysis are present inTable II.

The composition was computed from the known nucleotide sequence and adjusted for 143 residues. To further characterize the two major IFN a species, the 22,000 and 26,000 dalton species were individually subjected to CN,Br degradation and the resulting polypeptides were partially sequenced in an automated protein sequentor. The partial sequences of the 22,000 and 26,000 dalton species are presented in Table III and are correlated with the published nucleotide sequence for the same region.

In the case of Example 7, the SDS PAGE procedure was conducted in cylindrical gels, with the Molecular weight marker proteins beinrun concurrently but in separate cylindrical gels. ,.,In contrast the SDS PAGE analysis of IFN in Example 9 was performed in a slab gel system with the molecular weight markers being run in parallel channels within the same gel.This latter system is known to provide a more accurate molecular weight estimate for IFN g . The variation between the compositional analyses disclosed in Examples 7 and 9 is due to the presence of residual NH4 in the gels of the material analyzed inExample 7, whereas the gels of Example 9 were extensively dialyzed to remove the excess NH4 prior to subjecting the sample for amino acid analysis. The excess NH4 resulted from the NH4 persulfate catalyst employed to form the gels. As is known, the analysis of basic amino acids is particularly susceptible to variation due to excess NH4 in the gels.Although the results presented in Example 7 in the presence of excess NH4 and the results presented inExample 9 in which the excess NH4 has been removed are both reproducible, it is likely that the data presented inExample 9 more accurately reflects the true amino acid composition of the IFN g .Further the absence of a species of IFN z in this Example which corresponds to the 20,000 dalton species in Example 7, lends credence to the notion that the species identified as g 1 and 2in Example 7 represent two forms of IFN having substantially the same amino acid composition rather than different compositions, the compositioned differences observed between the two species likely being due to the presence of excess NH4 during the analysis of same.
