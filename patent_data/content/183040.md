# Radiation image recording and read out apparatus.

## Abstract
Stimulable phosphor sheets are circulated through an image recording section for recording radiation images on the stimulable phosphor sheets, an image read out section for scanning the stimulable phosphor sheets by stimulating rays and detecting light emitted thereby upon stimulation, and a erasing section for releasing radiation energy remain ing on the stimulable phosphor sheets after read out. The recording section is provided with at least two slits posi tioned such that at least one slit is located on either side of the object and drive means for synchronously driving the slits, whereby it is possible to obtain recorded radiation images free from the effect of scattered radiation.
