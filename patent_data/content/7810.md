# A PROCESS FOR EMULSION GRAFTING DIENE RUBBER PARTICLES

## Abstract
This invention relates to an improved process for prepar ing stable latices of relatively large rubber particles compris ing the steps of A agglomerating a diene rubber latex having a particle size of less than about 0.20 microns to rubber parti cles having a rubber particle size of about 0.3 to 1.0 microns, B stabilizing said rubber particles with an emulsifying agent forming a stable agglomerated rubber latex and C grafting said agglomerated rubber particles to form a latex of grafted rubber particles, the improvement comprising carrying out step A at a temperature of about 1 to 25 C and step C under grafting conditions such that said monomer composition is activated with a redox catalyst system operating at tempera tures of 35 to 50 C. providing a stable latex of grafted aggloni erated rubber particles essentially free of coagulum.
