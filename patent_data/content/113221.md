## Abstract
A drive circuit 18 applies an oscillating signal to the drive coil W1, W3, W5 and W7 of the fluxgate 1 thereby generating output pulses from the detection coils W2 and W6, W4 and W8 of the fluxgate 1 , which pulses have an area proportional to the magnetic flux through that coil. The output pulses are integrated sequentially by an integrator 19 . The output may be used directly to obtain the orienta tion of the fluxgate 1 , and hence of a vessel in which the fluxgate 1 is mounted but it is preferable on the grounds of accuracy and speed of response to apply a predetermined number of pulses from one detection coil W2 and W6 , apply a constant signal to the integrator 19 ano measure the time between the application of that constant signal and the integrator output attaining a predetermined value. This may be measured digitally giving a more accurate measurement of the fluxgate orientation. Suitable error elimination means VR1, VR2, VR3 may be provided.
