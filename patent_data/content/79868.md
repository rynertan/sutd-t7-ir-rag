# A device for achieving touch sensitivity in musical instruments provided with a keyboard.

## Abstract
The device makes it possible to use one single transduc er T for 1, 2, 3,...N number of keys with the aid of discriminator blocks D₁, D₂, D₃,...DN to which consent to open is given by an electrical control signal 10a that is received as each key is depressed. The price at which musical instruments provided with a keyboard are marketed has hitherto been related, to a great extent, to the fact that each key has had to be linked functionally to its own transducer.

## Claims
Claims 1. A device for achieving touch sensitivity in musical instruments provided with a keyboard, w erein there is one single transducer T for a number of keys in excess of one, and any mechanical, electronic or electromechanical system that can succeed in discriminating the keys depressed anon those belonging to a grout related to one and the sane trans ducer T. 2. A device according to Claim 1, whevein the transducer T is any direct or compound transducer realized with any direct or derived principle of physics such as, for example, an electromagnetic transducer, an electrostatic transducer, a piezoelectric transducer, an optical transducer, a Hall effect transducer, etcetera. 3. A device according to Claims 1 and 2, wherein there are systems for stressing the transducer T actuated by the keys both directly and indirectly through the medium of auxiliary manual, semi automatic and automatic systems.

## Description
device for achievin touch sensitivit in musical instruments provided with a keyboardAll the touch sensivity instruments anufactured up until now, irrespective of whatever operating principle may char acterize them, have one fundamental element in common, that is to say, each individual key plays thanks to a transducer linked functionally to it. For example, a piano having 73 keys is provided with 73 transducers, each o which, in so way, represents artistically the pressure or derived mechanical quantity that the fingers of the person playing the piano applies on the corresponding key.Experiments carried out, particularly in regard to the inter finger relationship on one and the same hand at the time a piece of music is being played, lead to the following conclusions 1 it is practically impossible for a number of fingers on one hand to apply, at the same moment, pressures that dif fer so much that t the ear is able to detect the diversity this is because of the synchronous movement mutual dependence of the fingers on one and the same hand a difference in pressure can be applied and detected only when the fingers operate in succession at any small intervals of tine 2 in consequence of the foregoing it is, therefore, pos sible to use one transaucer for any number of keys, provided that provision be made for a suitable system for distin guishing the kes that t have been depressed, even in a rapid tin succession, and or giving the relevant information to peripheral structures which interpret the said data and restore acoustic independence between the said depressed keys. The object of the device according to the invention is, therefore, to achieve touch sensitivity in musical instruments provided with a keyboard, using one single transducer or one transducer for a number of keys, with a reduction in costs in comparison with the methods adopted to date, the actual ratio being 1 N wherein K is of a value over and above 1 related to the sane transducer.The invention is illustrated on the accompanying figures, in hi cli Figure 1 depicts the device forming the subject of the invention in a block diagram Figure 2 details one application example for the said de vice Figure 3 shows, in a lateral view, one of the keys depict ed in Figure 2.With reference to the above listed figures, the blocks shown at 1, 2, 3,....J., represent keys of a keyboard related to one and the same transducer T.Each of these keys is able to exert a force t F2,FN, respectively, that is dependent on the pressure applied on the applicable key by the person playing the instrument.The said forces are all distributed over a force collection systen shown at e, which transnits, for each force or sys ten of forces b which it is contemporaneously stressed, one single force 7 and this, in turn, goes and stresses the transducer T. In consequence of this, the transducer T furnishes a response generally an electrical signal in the forn of an impulse I. The said impulse I goes into each and every one of IT discriminator blocks shown atD2, D3,....DN but issues only at the output U1, U2, U3,....UN of the block or blocks to which consent to open is given by information synchronous with the force or electrical control signal iCa imparted by the relevant depressed ke. The output of the impulse is just as though there were N transducers, e each lined to one particular key, though in dependent of one another. Three keys, shown at 1, 2 and 3, are depicted in Figure 2, able to rotate around a pivoting point shown at 6. At 4 are shown the hammers that stress, for example directly, the transducer T from which, in a time sequence, the impul ses I are taken.With reference to Figure 3, when the key 1 is depressed it rotes around the pivot 6 and the hammer 4 strikes the transducer T. At the same tine as the latter is being stressed, the support S integral with the key raises a metal spring, shown t 9, as far as it will go so that it be brought into contact with an electrical conductor, shown at 10, from which the electrical control signal IOa is with drawn. The said signal normally a direct current voltage signal goes into a block shown at 11 for example an AND circuit contemporaneously with the impulse I supplied by the transducer T.The function of the block 11 is that of an electronic switch, that is to say, it only allows the impulse I to pass when the electrical control signal 10a is also present. In cases when the electronic switch is provided with a timing system 12 for example an ordinary R C circuit and thus the control voltage acts only cr a suit able period of tine, independently of for how long the rel evant key may remain depressed, it can readily be appreciated that even if other keys belonging to the same group in other words related to the sa e transducer are depressed, despite the inpulses I thus created being present at the input to the block 11, the are not able to pass through the output U of the said bloc since the consent to do this is lacking. Obviously the block 11 together with the timing system 12 can constitute one of the discrininabor blocks D depicted in Figure 1.In this way a sinple system is achieved by which the keys depressed can be discriminated in the way outlined herein.
