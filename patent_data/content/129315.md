## Description
TWO COMPONENT BIOCIDAL SYSTEM Field of the Invention This invention relates to two component biocidal systems suitable for use in controlling slimes, bacteria, and fungi in industrial waters. Background of the Invention The existence of slimes, bacteria and fungi in waters, particulary industrial waters, is an ongoing problem.Examples of industrial waters where slimes and the like can interfere with industrial processes include cooling towers, effluent discharges, waters used for conveying particulate matter, and the like In particular, pulp and paper mill production waters are affected by resident microflora and the slimes produced by the microflora. These slimes can interfere with the production process, causing nozzle plugging, screen blinding, and sheet defects such as holes and discolorations. The term slime or slimes refers to a broad range of mucous, viscous, and leathery materials. These materials typically comprise or originate from polymeric, generally polysaccharide excretions produced by a broad spectrum of microorganisms. Typically, biological deposits of all types including slimes are treated by the addition of biocides or chemicals.Where slimes are present, biocides are frequently added in an effort to destroy the bacteria or microflora population which may produce the slimes. Chemicals which have been used for this purpose include chlorine compounds including the chlorophenates organomercurial compounds such as phenylmercuric acids thiocarbamate compounds thiocyanate compounds such as the isothiocyanates and methylenebis thiocyanate tributyltin oxide and the like. However, these chemicals tend to be costly and highly toxic in the quantities known to be required for effective control of microbial populations. As a further drawback, most of these chemicals tend to be most effective at an acid pH, such that in more alkaline systems, even greater concentrations are required. Additionally, it appears that no precise correlation exists between the size of the bacterial population and the accumulation of slime.Substantial slime accumulations have been observed even in waters having a low bacterial count. Similarly, high bacterial counts have been observed in waters having no significant slime accumulation. Consequently, use of a biocide may not adequately control biological slime accumulations. As an alternative to treatment with biocides, it is also known that slime accumulation can be controlled to a certain degree by use of the enzyme levan hydrolase, also known as levanase. It was discovered that levan, a polysaccharide produced by a variety of bacteria, is a significant component of many industrial slimes. U.S.Patent No. 3,824,184 to Herbert J. Hatcher, discloses the addition of levan hydrolase to industrial waters having a slime accumulation or potential slime problem. The enzyme can hydrolyze the levan present in the slimes, substantially decomposing the slimes and lessening the problems associated with their presence in the water systems. However, the enzyme does nothing to limit or reduce the microbial population. We have discovered that the combination of a biocide and a polysaccharide degrading enzyme will significantly reduce microbial counts and slime accumulations, far more effectively than a biocide or an enzyme alone. Brief Description of the Invention We have discovered a biocidal system including a biocide and a sufficient amount of a polysaccharide degrading enzyme to increase the effectiveness of the biocide. Detailed Description of the Invention Biocide The biocide component of this invention can include substantially any biocide which will not adversely affect the activity of the enzyme, discussed below. Examples of suitable biocides include chlorophenate compounds such as pentachlorophenates and trichlorophenates organomer curial compounds such as phenylmercuric acid carbamate compounds such as methyldithiocarbamates, ethylenebisdithiocarbamates, and dimethyldithiocarbamates carbonate compounds such as cyanodithioimidocarbonates thiocyanates such as chloroethylene thiocyanate compounds, and methylene bis thiocyanate compounds and other biocides such as bromo hydroxyacetophenone compounds benzothioazole compounds ethylene diamine compounds, nitrilopropionamides bromopropionamides bromo acetoxybutenes bromopropanolaldehyde compounds bis tri chloromethyl sulfones dimethyl hydantoin compounds and the like. Mixtures of biocides can also be used. The biocide methylene bis thiocyanate has proven to be particularly effective in the context of this invention, as has a combination of dimethyldithiocarbonate and disodium ethylenebisdithiocarbamate. The biocides can be obtained from many chemical suppliers such as American Cyanamide, Betz, Beckman, Dearborn Chemical, Economics Laboratory, Inc., Merck, Nalco,Vineland Chemical, and the like. The concentration of biocide required for effectiveness in this invention varies greatly and can depend upon the conditions such as temperature and pH of the water, the microbial count and the type of industrial water being treated. The lower and upper limits of the required concentrations will substantially depend upon the specific biocide or combination of biocides used. For example, a highly effective biocide can require a concentration of only about 1 or 2 parts biocide to one million parts industrial water ppm in the context of this invention, while a quaternary ammonium compound may require a minimum concentration of 75 or 100 ppm. With certain biocides the upper level concentration can reach 600 ppm or more.For three of the previously mentioned biocides, the approximate ranges of concentration for effectiveness in this invention, and a generally preferred range for effectiveness in papermaking processes, is provided below PreferredBiocide Range RangeMethylene bis thiocyanate 5 30 ppm 15 25 ppmCarbamates 50 250 ppm 75 125 ppmBromopropionamides 100 400 ppm 200 300 ppmWhether a given concentration will be effective is dependent upon many factors such as the conditions, the particular industrial process, the organic load in the system, machine cleanliness, and the specific biocide or mixture of biocides in use. Many biocides generally require a much higher concentration to be effective at an alkaline pH than at an acid pH. However, in the context of this invention, even at an alkaline pH, a lower concentration of the biocide in combination with the enzyme will generally be adequate for effective reduction of microbial counts. Enzvme The enzyme component of this invention can be any effective polysaccharide degrading enzyme or polysaccharidase. The enzyme chosen should correspond to the problemcausing polysaccharide or polysaccharides present in the water system. For example, the presence of various starch compounds, glycogen compounds, dextran compounds, levan compounds and the like may be undesirable in industrial waters. The enzyme added to a system having any of the these particular polysaccharides present should be one which will hydrolyze that particular polysaccharide. For example, the enzyme could be dextranase, alpha or beta amylase, a levan hydrolase formulation, or the like. Many microorganisms form an extracellular fructan polysaccharide known as levan. Levan slimes and the microorganisms producing levan are typically present in paper mill production waters and are known to cause serious problems for the pulp and paper industry. An enzyme product containing levan hydrolase or levanase will be effective against slimes or microbial coatings of levan. By using methods known in the art, the desired enzyme can generally be obtained from the appropriate enzymeproducing microorganisms by providing them with the required nutrient to induce enzyme production. Microorganisms that are known to produce the enzyme levan hydrolase includeRhodotorula sup., Azotobacter sp., Bacillus sup., Arthobacter sp, r Micrococcus sp., and Pseudomonas sp. Levan hydrolase production can typically be induced in these organisms by providing them with the nutrient levan using the appropriate procedures and conditions such as are known. One such method for producing levan hydrolase is disclosed in U.S.Patent No. 3,773,623. Another method for producing levan hydrolase is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 2,673,828. There are several known methods for producing. the required nutrient such as levan, dextran, and the like for use in inducing enzyme production. Methods for producing levan, dextran and the like are disclosed in U.S. PatentsNo. 3,033,758 2,673,828 and 3,391,061. The enzyme component of this invention can comprise a whole cell culture enzyme crude product , including the enzyme compound itself, the microorganisms which produce the enzyme, and the various fermentation products. Alternatively, the enzyme component can comprise the purified enzyme, obtained, for example, by fractionation. Stabilizing agents such as sodium sulfite or other reducing agents, cellular protein, and propylene glycol or other effective polyalcohols may also be desirable, as is known in the art. Method of Use In treating the industrial waters, preferably, the enzyme component is added first to begin degradation of the polysaccharides within the system. The enzyme component can be added using any known method which will provide the desired concentration of enzyme to the waters. An enzyme concentration of at least about 2 parts enzyme at 500 units per ml, per one million parts industrial water, or 4 units of levan hydrolase activity per gallon of industrial water, is typically required for the desired results of this invention. Typically, the enzyme is intermittently added to the industrial waters. A preferred method is the timed feed, where the appropriate addition is gauged on the water flow characteristics of the system. The enzyme addition rate can be monitored, and maintained at the desired level, by known methods. If the enzyme is added in too large a quantity at one time, the polysaccharide deposits may break free before substantially degrading. Such deposits can interfere with the industrial processes by blocking the system, causing breaks in the paper products, or the like. The temperature of thè industrial waters can affect the activity of the enzyme. Consequently, the preferred water temperature is one where the enzyme will be sufficiently active to produce the desired decrease in slime and microbial populations, at a lowered concentration of biocide. Typically, particularly with levan hydrolase, the desired enzyme activity for rapid hydrolysis occurs at a water temperature between about 750 F. and 150a I or more preferably for reasons of enzyme activity, 900 F. to 1350F. Typically the enzyme is sold as an enzyme crude product, in liquid form, in packaging such as 55 gallon drums. It is also envisioned that the enzyme crude product could be sold in a dried form, for example, by units of enzyme activity per pound, where the enzyme or enzyme crude product has been dried onto an insoluble substrate such as a protein. In process waters, the stock of biocide is preferably.slug fed, although any other appropriate method of adding it to the system may be used. However, a continuous feed of biocide may result in the overgrowth of microorganisms which are resistant to the biocidal agent. The biocide component is typically sold in drums, cartons, or other packaging, in liquid or dry form in varying concentrations, as is known in the art. It is often preferable that the enzyme and the biocide be fed to separate parts or machines in the system because some biocides can be harmful at high concentrations to the enzyme. The following specific Examples which include the best mode were prepared and tested as described. Example I Into each of six duplicate 250 ml shake flasks was charged 50 ml Difco nutrient broth medium. The medium was inoculated from a slant of Aerobacter levanicum. The flasks were shaken for one hour at 300 C. to accelerate growth of the microorganisms. The flasks were then set aside for an incubation period of about 48 hours at 300 C. After the incubation period, the flasks were shaken briefly and samples were taken for an initial zero time plate count. As indicated in Table 1, to four of the six flasks was added a stated amount of a whole cell culture containing the enzyme levan hydrolase at a concentration of 500 units per ml. A unit of levan hydrolase activity is that amount of liquid or powder that will form 0.35 micrograms of fructose per minute from the levan substrate.All flasks were then shaken for 1 2 hour at 300 C. on a rotary shaker operating at approximately 150 rpm. As further indicated in Table 1, four of he six flasks then received an addition of the stated amount of methylene bis thiocyanate. The flasks were again placed on the shaker for about 4 hours and plate counts were made. The results were as follows Table 1Methylene Whole Cell bis thio Culture Containing Colony cyanate Levan Hydrolase Formina ppm ppm Units 35 0 3.6 x 104 35 21 2.8 x 102 40 0 2.5 x 104 40 21 1.8 x 101 0 21 2.2 x 109 0 0 9.7 x 108 Surprisingly, the combination of the biocide plus levan hydrolase resulted in substantially fewer colony forming units than the expected additive result of the biocide alone plus levan hydrolase in the whole cell culture. Examples II VII For each Example four duplicate 250 ml shake flasks containing 50 ml Difco nutrient broth medium and 0.5 by weight sucrose were inoculated from slant cultures ofAerobacter levanicum, Rhodotorula glutinis, or Bacillus subtilis. The flasks were shaken on a rotary shaker at approximately 150 rpm for 30 minutes at 300 C. They were then removed to a 300 C. incubator, for incubation as stationary cultures for approximately 24 hours in the use of Bacillus subtilis, the cultures were incubated with slow agitation 30 rpm rather than as a stationary culture, and for about 18 hours rather than 24 hours . At the end of the stationary incubation period, samples were taken for zero time plate counts. As indicated in the Tables, to two of the flasks was added the stated amount of a whole cell culture containing levan hydrolase at a concentration of approximately 500 units ml. These flasks were shaken on the rotary shaker at 150 rpm and 300 C. for 1 2 hour. As further indicated in the Tables, to two of the flasks, including one which had been treated with the whole cell culture, was added the stated biocide at the stated concentration. All four flasks were then placed on the rotary shaker for mixing for 5 minutes. They were then incubated as stationary cultures at 300 C. for approximately 2 1 2 hours. Standard plate counts were then taken on the contents of all four flasks. The plate counts were read after 48 72 hours of incubation at 300 C.The results were as follows Example II Met hlene bis thiocyanate MBT and Whole Cell CultureContaining Levan Hydrolase LH Effects on Viability of Aerobacter levanicum.MBT LH Colony Forminq Units 20 ppm 0 1.4 x 109 20 ppm 40 ppm 1.2 x 106 0 ppm 40 ppm 6.9 x 109 0 ppm 0 ppm 4.3 x 109EXAMPLE III Methylene bis thiocyanate MBT and Whole Cell CultureContainina Levan Hydrolase LH Effects on Viability of Rhodotorula alutinis.

Examples VIII and IX For each Example, four duplicate 250 ml shake flasks containing 50 ml Difco nutrient broth medium and 0.5 by weight sucrose were inoculated from a slant culture ofSphaerotilus. To the flask was then added and hand shaken, 5 by weight of a levan solution containing 5 g. levan per 100 g. total solution. The cells were allowed to incubate for 24 hours at room temperature. After the incubation period, the stated amount of a whole cell culture containing levan hydrolase 500 units per ml was added and the mixture was briefly hand shaken. After 2 hours, the stated amount of biocide was added to the flasks and they were briefly hand shaken. The mixture was allowed to rest at room temperature. After 2 hours, plate counts of surviving cells were made, with the results as shown in the Tables.Example VIII Methylene bis thiocyanate MBT and Whole Cell CultureContaining Levan Hydrolase LH Effects on Viability of Sphaerotilus.MBT LH Colony Forming Units 10 ppm 0 ppm 5.3 x 104 10 ppm 40 ppm 4.7 x 103 0 ppm 40 ppm 9.8 x 107 0 ppm 0 ppm 8.6 x 106Example IX Sodium dimethyl dithiocarbamate DTC and Whole CellCulture Containing Levan Hydrolase LH Effects on Viability of Sphaerotilus.DTC LH Colony Forming Units 100 ppm 0 ppm 4.5 x 104 100 ppm 40 ppm 6.8 x 103 0 ppm 40 ppm 5.3 x 107 0 ppm 0 ppm 2.0 x 107 The test results show that the combination of biocide and a whole cell culture containing levan hydrolase is significantly more effective against Sphaerotilus than is biocide alone, levan hydrolase alone, or no treatment whatsoever. While we do not wish to be limited to any theory, we have learned that most bacteria which secrete polysaccharides such as levan, develop a capsular polysaccharide layer covering the cell surface. The polysaccharide layer can protect the bacteria from the action of biocides.Other microorganisms present in a medium containing polysaccharide producing bacteria also tend to become coated with a similar protective layer, possibly due to the solubility of most such polysaccharides. Thus, other microorganisms in addition to the polysaccharide producing bacteria develop resistance to biocidal compositions. We have also discovered that the appropriate enzyme can degrade or destroy the protective layer and significantly enhance the efficacy of a biocide, such that significantly less biocide is required to reduce microbial counts to a satisfactory level. At the same time the enzyme will act upon the slimes, hydrolyzing the polysaccharide component. The above discussion and Examples provide the detailed discussion of the invention. However, since many embodiments of the invention can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, the invention resides wholly in the claims hereinafter appended.
