# A method of controlling a heat exchanger.

## Abstract
A method of controlling flows of heat donating fluid Q A device for executing the method comprises tempera ture sensors 31, 34 and 33, 32, respectively arranged in the inlets 1, 4 and outlets 2, 3 of the two fluids, the signals of said temperature sensors being applied to differentiating units 35, 36 , one for the temperatures of each fluid, the output signals of the two differentiating units are applied to a quotient unit 37 , said unit generating an output signal Ï„
