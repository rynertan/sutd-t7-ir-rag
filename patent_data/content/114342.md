# A method of producing reverse transcriptase.

## Abstract
A method of producing reverse transcriptase, which comprises isolating a fraction containing retrovirus from a tissue culture fluid supernatant of retrovirus producing cells which are able to grow and propagate in vitro, treating said fraction at least once by sucrose density gradient centrifuga tion to thereby obtain a purified retrovirus, and extracting reverse transcriptase from said purified retrovirus.
