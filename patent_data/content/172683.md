# Mass spectrometer.

## Abstract
A mass spectrometer of the type wherein a solenoidal magnet 20 produces a magnetic field that includes a region along its geometric central axis 21 . That region is a region of high field intensity and high homogeneity with magnetic flux lines in the region being generally parallel to the magnet central axis 21 . A high vacuum is established in the region and a sample cell 13 is positioned at or within the region in which sample ions are formed, trapped, excited and de tected. An ionizing device 15 is positioned outside of the region and off the central axis 21 while an additional ionizing device 23 may be positioned on the central axis 21 . In a preferred embodiment, the off axis ionizing device 15 may be supported for movement relative to the central axis. A preferred ionizing device for the off axis device is an electron gun.
