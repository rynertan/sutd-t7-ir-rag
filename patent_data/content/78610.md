# Fixing rigid inserts in a flexible material.

## Abstract
To achieve highly fluid tight sealing of a rigid insert into an orifice in flexible material 101 , the insert is made in two parts 103, 106 which can be pressed together with purely axial movement, one part deforming slightly relative to the other at least during the movement, until they adopt as a result of interengagement between them a relationship in which they exert a predetermined sealing pressure on the edge portion of the flexible material between their radially extending flanges 108, 109 . A bead 102 may be accomo dated in an oversize recess 122 in the flanges. A sub assembly such as an eyepiece 111 is held fluid tight in one 103 of the parts. Detent means 107, 116 are designed to maintain a sealing contact even if the flexible material 101 or sealing ring 118 creep or set. Though the orifice has an endless edge it is not neces sarily circular in outline.
