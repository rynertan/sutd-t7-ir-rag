Further, a second feature of the present invention is that the apparatus according to the pres ent invention is equipped with nozzles for introducing a com pressed gas into the bags and pressure gauges for measuring a pressure within the bags in order to detect whether or not each bag is normally gripped by the grippers. Furthermore, another feature of the present invention is that a return pipe is fixed to a filling device so that the filling material may be returned to a storage tank, without being discharged there through, by closing the filling nozzle. Still another feature of the present invention is that seal bars for sealing the bags are covered with a heat resistant cloth, and the cloth is sent out in turn to maintain uniform sealing conditions.
