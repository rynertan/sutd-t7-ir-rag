## Description
A PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF LOW ASPHALTENES HYDWXARBCP J MMNRES The invention relates to a process for the production of deasphalted oils and hydrocarbon oil distillates from asphaltenescontaining hydrocarbon mixtures. In the atmospheric distillation of crude mineral oil for the production of light hydrocarbon oil distillates, such as gasoline, kerosine and gas oil, an asphaltenes containing residue is obtained as by product. These residues, which usually contain a substantial quantity of sulphur and mentals in addition to asphaltenes, were initially used as fuel oil. In view of the need for light hydrocarbon oil distillates and the decreasing mineral oil reserves, several treatments have already been proposed aiming at producing light hydrocarbon oil distillates from atmospheric residues. For example, it is possible to separate a deasphalted oil fram an atmospheric residue by solvent deasphalting and to subject said deasphalted oil to catalytic cracking, optionally in the presence of hydrogen.It is also possible to separate an atmospheric residue into a vacuum distillate and a vacuum residue by vacuum distillation, to separate a deasphalted oil from the vacuum residue by solventdeasphalting and subjecting both the vacuum distillate and the deasphalted oil to catalytic cracking, optionally in the presence of hydrogen. A drawback of the conventional solvent deasphalting, in which an asphaltenes containing feed is separated in one step into a deasphalted oil as desired main product and an asphalt as byproduct, is that for realizing a sufficiently high yield of deasphalted oil, one usually has to accept a deasphalted oil of insufficient quality. In this connection the quality of the deasphalted oil is meant to be its suitability for conversion into hydrocarbon oil distillates by catalytic cracking optionally in the presence of hydrogen. Said suitability is higher according as the dsasphalted oil has, inter alia, a lower asphaltenes, metal and sulphur content.By subjecting a deasphalted oil of insufficient quality to a pretreatment, it can as yet be made suitable for conversion into hydrocarbon oil distillates by catalytic cracking optionally in the presence of hydrogen. It has been found that the above mentioned drawback of the conventional solvent deasphalting can be alleviated to some extent by carrying out the solvent deasphalting as a two step process, in which the asphaltenes containing hydrocarbon mixture is separated into a deasphalted oil of high quality for the sake of brevity termed below deasphalted oil 1 , a deasphalted oil of lower quality for the sake of brevity termed below deasphalted oil 2 and an asphalt, Deasphalted oil 1 differs fran deasphalted oil 2 mainly by a substantially lower asphaltes, metal and sulphur content.Comparison of the results of the cne step process with those of the two step process shows that starting fraa an equal quantity of an asphaltenes containing hydrocarbon mixture for the production of an equal total quantity of deasphalted oil, which deasphalted oil is of insufficient quality in the one step process, the two step process yields two deasphalted oils of which deasphalted oil 1 is suitable as such for conversion into hydrocarbon oil distillates by catalytic cracking optionally in the presence of hydrogen.A deasphalted oil of insufficient quality is admittedly also obtained in the two step process, but in a considerably smaller quantity than in the one step process. Since solvent deasphalting has in practice been found to be suitable for the production of deasphalted oils from various asphaltenes containing hydrocarbon mixtures and a two step solvent deasphalting process has moreover been found to yield better results than a one step process, it was ascertained to what extent it would be possible to obtain a better result by combining the two step solvent deasphalting process with aftertreatment s of the deasphalted oil 2 and or the asphalt and application of a residual fraction of the aftertreated product s as a feed carponent for the two step solvent deasphalting, than when using just a two step solvent deasphalting process.An investigation into catalytic hydrotreatent, in which a feed is converted into a product with a reduced Ramsbottom Carbon Test value RCT , catalytic cracking and thermal cracking as possible aftertreatments was conducted. In all cases the resulting products were separated by distillation into one or more distillate fractions and a residual fraction and at least one of the resultant residual fractions was used as a feed carpent for the two step solventdeasphalting. In the evaluation of the result the yield and the quality of the deasphalted oils and the asphalt play a prominent part. The yield of light product is also of great importance. In this connection by quality of asphalt is meant the suitability to serve as a fuel oil component.Said suitability is higher according as the asphalt has a lower metal and sulphur content and a lower viscosity and density. Carpared with a nKxie of operation in which just a two step solvent deasphalting is used, the combin ations tested generally resulted in a higher yield of deasphalted oil 1 and a considerable yield of hydrocarbon oil distillat . Sate combinations have been found to yield deasphalted oils and or asphalt of a better quality. The present invention therefore relates to a process for the production of deasphalted oils and hydrocarbon oil distillates fran aspaltenes containg hydrocarbon mixtures, characterized in that an asphaltenes containing hydrocarbon mixture is separated by two step solvent deasphalting into a deasphalted oil 1 of high quality, a deasphalted oil 2 of lower quality and an asphalt, that the deasphalted oil 2 or the asphalt is converted by a catalytic hydrotreatment into a product having a reduced RCT which is separated by distillation into one or more distillate fractions and a residual fraction, that the residual fraction is subjected to thermal or catalytic cracking or used as a feed component for solvent deasphalting and the cracked product obtained is separated by distillation into one or more distillate fractions and a residual fraction, which latter fraction is used as a feed component for solvent deasphalting, or that the deasphalted oil 2 is subjected to therrtal or catalytic cracking and or that the asphalt is subjected to thermal cracking and that a distillation residue of the cracked product s is converted by a catalytic hydrotreatrtent into a product with a reduced icr that is separated by distillation into one or more distillate fractions and a residual fraction which is used as a feed component for solvent deasphalting. As regards the feeds used for each of the aftertreatments as well as w1 applying more than one aftertreatltent and the sequence in which said treatments take place, a number of preferred enixxli ments will be discussed hereinafter.It is applicable to all the eeeodeents that the asphaltenes containing hydrocarbon mixture used as feed is first separated by a two step solvent deasphalting treatrtent into a deasphalted oil 1, a deasphalted oil 2 and an asphalt and that at least one of the residual fractions obtained in the aftertreatment is used as a feed component for solventdeasphalting, in particular the two step solvent deasphalting treatment referred to hereinabove. A preferred embodiment of the process according to the present invention relates to a process for the production of a deasphalted oil and hydrocarbon oil distillates from asphaltenescontaining hydrocarbon mixtures, in which an asphaltenes containing hydrocarbon mixture is separated by two step solvent deasphalting into a deasphalted oil 1 of high quality, a deasphalted oil 2 of lower quality and an asphalt, in which deasphalted oil 2 is converted by catalytic hydrotreatment into a product having a reduced RCT which is separated by distillation into one or more distillate fractions and a residual fraction, in which said residual fraction is converted by thermal or catalytic cracking into a cracked product which is separated by distillation into one or more distillate fractions and a residual fraction, the latter residual fraction being used as a feed component for the two step solvent deasphalting. In this enExxLdment class I the deasphalted oil 2 is subjected to a catalytic hydrotreatment. Class I can be further subdivided depending on whether the distillation residue of the hydrotreated product is subjected to thermal cracking class IA or to catalytic cracking class IB . A preferred embodiment of class I comprises a process wherein the residual fraction separated from the product of the catalytic hydrotreatment is subjected to thermal cracking and that the asphalt is used as a feed component for thermal crackling. A further preferred embodiment of the process according to the present invention relates to a process for the production of deasphalted oils and hydrocabon oil distillates from asphaltenes containing hydrocarbon mixtures, in which an asphaltenes containing hydrocarbon mixture is separated by two step solvent deasphalting into a deasphalted oil 1 of high quality, a deasphalted oil 2 of lower quality and an asphalt, in which the asphalt is converted by catalytic hydrotreatment into a product having a reduced RCT which is separated by distillation into one or more distillate fractions and a residual fraction and in which the residual fraction is used as a feed component for the solvent deasphalting or is converted by thermal or catalytic cracking into a cracked product which is separated by distillation into one or more distillate fractions and a residual fraction, the latter residual fraction being used as a feed component for solvent deasphalting. In this embodiment class II the asphalt is subjected to a catalytic hydrotreatment. Class II can be further subdivided depending on whether the distillation residue of the hydrotreated product is used as a feed component for solvent deasphalting, in particular two step solvent deasphalting class IIA or is sub jected to thermal cracking class IIB or to catalytic cracking class IIC . A preferred embodiment of class II comprises a process wherein the residual fraction separated from the product of the catalytic hydrotreatrent is used as a feed component for solventdeasphalting and that the deasphalted oil 2 is converted by thermal or catalytic cracking into a cracked product which is separated by distillation into one or mDre distillate fractions and a residual fraction that is used as a feed component for solvent deasphalting. A fther preferred embodiment of class II comprises a process wherein the residual fraction separated fran the product of the catalytic hydrotreatment is converted by thermal or catalytic cracking into a cracked product and that the deasphalted oil 2 is used as a feed component for thermal or catalytic cracking and that a distillation residue of the thermally or catalytically cracked product is used as a feed catpoooot for solvent deasphalting. A third preferred embodiment of the process according to the present invention relates to a process for the production of deasphalted oils and hydrocarbon oil distillates fran asphaltenescontaining hydrocarbon mixtures, in which an asphaltenes containing hydrocarbon mixture is separated by two step solvent deasphalting into a deasphaited oil 1 of high equality, a deasphalted oil 2 of lower quality and an asphalt, in which the deasphalted oil 2 is subjected to thermal or catalytic cradling and or in which the asphalt is subjected to thermal cracking, in which a distillation residue of the cracked product is converted by catalytic hydro treatment into a product with a reduced RCT that is separated by distillation into one or more distillate fractions and a residual fraction and in which the residual fraction is used as a feed component for solvent deasphalting, in particular two step solvent deasphalting. In this embodiment class III the deasphalted oil 2 is subjected to thermal or catalytic cracking and or the asphalt is subjected to thermal cracking. Class III can be further subdivided depending on whether the apparatus in which the process is carried out contains in addition to a two step solvent deasphalting section and a catalytic hydrotreatment section, either a thermal cracking section class IIIA or a catalytic cracking section class IIIB , or both a thermal and a catalytic cracking section class IIIC , in which the deasphalted oil 2 and or the asphalt separated in the two step solvent deasphalting section is are further processed. A preferred eiedinent of class III comprises a process wherein the deasphalted oil 2 is thermally or catalytically cracked and that the asphalt is used as a feed component for the catalytic hydrotreatment. A further preferred eaixxlinent of class III comprises a process wherein the deasphalted oil 2 is catalytically cracked and that the asphalt is thermally cracked and that the mixture of the distillation residues of the cracked products is subjected to catalytic hydrotreatment. In the process according to the invention the feed used is an asphaltenes containing hydrocarbon mixture. The process is preferably applied to hydrocarbcn mixtures mainly boiling above 3500C and more than 35 by weight boiling above 5200C and having an above 7.5 by weight. Examples of such hydrocabon mixtures are residues obtained in the distillation of crude mineral oils as well as heavy hydrocarbon mixtures obtained from shale and tar sand. If desired, the process can also be used for heavy crude mineral oils and for residues obtained in the distillation of products formed in the thermal cracking of hydrocarbon mixtures.The process according to the invention is very suitable to be applied to residues obtained in the vacuum distillation of at mospheric distillation residues of crude mineral oils. The process according to the invention is further very suitable to be applied to residues obtained in the vacuum distillation of atrtospheric distillation residues of products formed in the thermal cracking of asphaltenes contSining hydrocarbon mixtures. If an atmospheric distillation residue is available as feed for the process according to the invention, it is preferred to separate therefrom a vacuum distillate by vacuum distillation and subject the resultant vacuum residue to the process according to the invention.The separated vacuum distillate can be converted into light hydrocarbon oil distillates by subjecting it to thermal cracking or catalytic cracking optionally in the presence of hydrogen. In the process according to the invention the feed is such jected to a two step solvent deasphalting. Suitable solvents for carrying out the deasphalting treatment are paraffinic hydrocarbons with 3 7 carbon atoms per molecule, such as propane, n butane, iso butane, n pentane, iso pentane and mixtures thereof, such as mixs of propane with n butane and mixtures of n butane with iso butane. Suitable solvent oil weight ratios lie better 7 1 and 1 1. The solvent deasphalting is preferably carried out at elevated temperature and pressure. The two step solvent deasphalting can in principle be carried out in two manners. Firstly the feed may be subjected to an extraction under mild conditions in which the feed is separated into a deasphalted oil 1 and a light asphalt and in the second step the light asphalt is subsequently subjected to a second extraction in which it is separated into a deasphalted oil 2 and the final asphalt as by product. In both steps The same solvent can be used, the deerse of extraction being controlled by means of the temperature temperature in the first step higher than in the second step . It is also possible to use different solvents, for example propane in the first step and n butane in the second step. Secondly, the feed may be subjected to an extraction under heavier conditions in which the feed is separated into a deasphalted oil and the final asphalt as by product and in the second step the deasphalted oil is subsequently separated into a deasphalted oil l and a deasphalted oil 2. To this end the mixture of deasphalted oil and solvent from the extractor should only be supplied to a settler in which the temperature is higher than that applied in the first step. The asphaltenes containing hydrocarbon mixtures used as feed in the process according to the invention usually contain a substantial quantity of metals, especially vanadium and nickel.In the two step solvent deasphalting treatment some of these metals find their way into the deasphalted oil 2 or the asphalt.In the catalytic hydrotreatment of the deasphalted oil 2, the asphalt or the distillation products obtained therefrom by thermal or catalytic cracking at least part of said metals deposits on the catalyst and consequently shortens its life.It is therefore preferred to subject a deasphalted oil 2, an asphalt or a cracking residue or a mixture of a cracking residue and an asphalt having a vanadium nickel content above 50 parts per million by weight ppmw to a demetallization treatment before contacting it with the catalyst applied in the catalytic hydrotreatment. Said de metallization can very suitably be carried out by contacting the product s to be demetallized in the presence of hydrogen with a catalyst consisting more than 80 by weight of silica.Both catalysts completely consisting of silica and catalysts containing one or more metals having hydrogenation activity, in particular a combination of nickel and vanadium, present on a carrier support substantially consisting of silica, are suitable for said purpose.If in the process according to the invention a catalytic demetallization in the presence of hydrogen is applied said demetallization can be carried out in a separate reactor. Since the catalytic demetallization and the catalytic hydrotreatment to reduce the RCT can be carried out under the same conditions, the two processes can also very suitably be carried out in tb same reactor, consecutively containing a bed of the demetallization catalyst and a bed of the catalyst used in the catalytic hydrotreatment. Suitable catalysts for carrying out the catalytic hydrotreatment are those containing at least one metal chosen fram the group formed by nickel and cobalt and at least one metal chosen fran the group formed by molybdenum and tungsten on a carrier consisting more than 40 by weight of alumina. Very suitable catalysts for carrying out the catalytic hydrotreatment are those containing the metal catbination nickel molybdenum or cobalt molybdenum on alumina. The catalytic hydrotreatment is preferably carried out at a temperature of from 300 5000C and in particular of fram 350 4500C, a pressure of fram 50 300 bar and in particular of from 75 200 bar, a space velocity of from 0.02 10 g.g l.h 1 and in particular of from 0.1 2 g.g l.h 1 and an feed ratio of from 100 5000 Nl.kg 1 and in particular of fran 5002000 Nl.kg 1. As regards the conditions applied in an optional catalytic demetallization to be carried out in the presence of hydrogen, the same preference holds as stated above for the catalytic hydrotreatment to reduce the RUST. The catalytic hydrotreatment is preferably carried out in such a manner that a product is obtained the C5 fraction of which fulfils the following reeuirenents a the RCT of the 95 fraction is less than 50 of the RCT of the feed to be hydrotreated, and b the quantity of hydrocarbons boiling below 3500C in the C5 fraction is less than 40 by weight. It should be noted that in the catalytic demetallization, apart fran reduction of the metal content, normally scone reduction of the RCT and formatian of C5 350 C product occur. Something similar normally applies to the catalytic hydrotreatment in which, apart from reduction of RCT and formation of C5 350 C product, sane reduction of the metal content takes place.As regards the requirements stated above under a and b it should be noted that they relate to the total reduction of the RCT and the formation of C5 350 C product that is including those occurring in an optional catalytic demetalliation . In the catalytic hydrotreatrtent a product with a reduced RCT is obtained fran which one or more distillate fractions and a residual fraction are separated. The distillate fractions separated from the product may be atmospheric distillates only, but it is preferred to separate a vacuum distillate fran the product.Said vacuum distillate can be converted into light hydrocarbon oil distillates in the manners stated hereinbefore. In sane of the embodiments of the process according to the invention a distillation residue of the hydrotreated product is subjected to thermal or catalytic cracking. One or more distillate fractions are then separated fran the cracked product. Said distillate fraction s may be atmospheric distillate s only, but it is preferred to separate a vacuum distillate fran the cracked product s . Said vacuum distillate can be converted into light hydrocarbon oil distillates in the manners stated hereinbefore.

If desired, the cracked products or fractions thereof can be combined and distilled together.

The e present application also relates to apparatuses for carrying out the process according to the invention, substantially corresponding with those diagrammatically shown in Figures 1 23. The e invention is now illustrated with reference to theExamples 1 6. In the process according to the invention the starting material was an asphaltenes containing hydrocarbon mixture obtained as residue in the vacuum distillation of an atmospheric distil latin residue of a crude mineral oil. The vacuum residue vainly boiled above 520 C and had an SCT of 18.8 by weight, a tatal vanadium and nickel content of 167 ppmw and a sulphur content of 5.4 by weight. The process was carried out according to the flow diagrams 1 6 respectively. The following conditions were applied in the various sections. In the processes described in the flow diagrams the two step solvent deasphalting was carried out by contacting the feed to be deasphalted in the first step in an extractor with an n butane isobutane mixture weight ratio 65 35 at a temperature of 1100C, a pressure of 40 bar and a solvent oil weight ratio of 2 1 and, after separation of the asphalt, separating the deasphalted oil into a deasphalted oil 1 and a deasphalted oil 2 in the second step in a settler at a temperature of 1400C and a pressure of 40 bar. In the processes described in the flow diagrams the catalytic hydrotreatment unit consisted of two reactors the first of which was filled with an Ni V SiO2 catalyst containing 0.5 parts by weight pew of nickel and 2.0 pbw of vanadium per 100 pbw of silica and the second of which was filled with an Ni Mo A1203 catalyst containing 4 4 pbw of nickel and 12 pbw of molybdenum per 100 pow of alumina. The catalysts were used in a volume ratio of 1 4.The e catalytic hydrotreatment was carried out at a hydrogen pressure of 150 bar, a space velocity measured over both reactors of 0.5 kg feed catalyst h, an feed ratio of 1000 N1 per kg and an average temperature of 4100C in the first reactor and of 3900C in the second reactor. In the process described in flow diagram 1 the thermal cracking was carried out in a cracking coil at a pressure of 10 bar, a space velocity of 2.5 kg of fresh feed per cracking coil volume per minute and a temperature of 4600C measured at the cracking coil outlet . In the processes described in flow diagrams 2, 3 and 6 the catalytic cracking was carried out at a temperature of 510 C, a pressure of 2.2 bar, a space velocity of 2 kg.kg .h and a catalyst regeneration rate of 1.0 part by weight of catalyst per 1000 pbw of oil and using a zeolitic cracking catalyst. In the process described in flow diagram 4, the thermal cracking was carried out as described for flow diagram 1, but at a space velocity of 0.4 kg of fresh feed per cracking coil volume per minute and in the process described in flow diagram 5, the thermal cracking was carried out in two cracking coils under conditions as described for flow diagram 1, but at space velocities of 0.4 and 2.5 kg of fresh feed per cracking coil volume per minute for asphalt and deasphalted oil 2 respectively. For comparison a test was also carried out in which the vacuum residue was subjected to a two step solvent deasphalting for the production of a deasphalted oil I and a deasphalted oil 2 Example 7 as well as a test in which the vacuum residue was subjected to one step solvent deasphalting for the production of a deasphalted oil 3 Example 8 . In Example 7 the two step solventdeasphalting was mainly carried cut in the same manner as described in the Examples 1 6, with the exception that the temperature in the settler described in Example 7 was 1440C.The one step solventdeasphalting described in Example 8 was carried cut in the same manner as the first step of the two step solvent deasphalting described in the Fxattples 1 6. In all the tests the asphaltenes containing hydrocarbon mixture 1 used as starting material was 100 parts by weight of vacuum residue.
