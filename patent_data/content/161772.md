# Method of monitoring the movement of a member in a glassware forming machine of the individual section type.

## Abstract
The method is for monitoring the movement of a member which is moved along a path which has a vertical component and an arcuate component about a vertical axis. The movement is brought about by a piston movable in a cylinder and having a piston rod projecting therefrom on which the member is mounted. A cam 20 which engages a cam track 16 is mounted on the piston rod or a further piston rod 14 of the piston and acts to cause the arcuate movement. The method comprises mounting a proximity detector 30 on the cam track to sense the piston rod, connecting the proximity detector to a contactless connector 36, 40 so that signals are passed from the mechanism to a transmit ter of the connector mounted on the machine frame 10 , and comparing signals received by the transmitter with signals indi cating the stage reached in the cycle of operation.
