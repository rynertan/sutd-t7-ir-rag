# Coupling element comprising a light source and a lens shaped element.

## Abstract
For optical communications systems as well as for video or audio longplay apparatus VLP ALP , it is necessary that a semiconductor laser to be used therein is situated in an exact position x, y and at an exact distance z from a first optical element for example, a lens of the optical system coupled to the laser. This is achieved in accordance with the invention by arranging the laser 35 in a bush shaped cover 33 on which a flange 61 is formed. On this flange 61 a holder 37 with a lens 39b is secured by way of a plastic metal solder layer 59 . The lens can be placed in the correct position and at a correct distance from the laser 35 by sliding the holder 37 and by pressing on the holder, the solder layer 59 then being plastically deformed whilst the space in which the laser is accommodated still remains hermetically sealed.
