# TUITION TABLE

## Abstract
A tuition table for small groups of pupils and an instructor has a circular table top 1 carried by a central pedestal 4 in the form of an upended hollow drum. The table top 1 comprises a central display 2 on the top of the drum shaped pedestal 4 . The display 2 comprises a glass plate 6 which lends itself to writing with a suitable pen, and a subjacent cloth 7 forming a screen for a slide projector 8 provided inside the pedestal 4 . The glass plate 6 and the cloth 7 are mounted in a carrier 9 which is rotatably mounted relatively to the pedestal 4 and the overhanging portion 3 of the table top, and which carries a frame 10, 11 for supporting the projector 8 . The table top 1 reaches no further outside the pedestal 4 than to allow all persons around the table easily to reach the central display.
