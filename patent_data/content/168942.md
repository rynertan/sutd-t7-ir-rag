# Lead screw and nut assembly.

## Abstract
A lead screw and nut assembly 10 for converting a rotary input into a linear output, includes an involute heliocoidal lead screw 12 , and a nut assembly 14 . The nut assembly 14 includes an annular ring 50 and a number of grooved rollers 40 congugate to the thread on the lead screw 12 . The annular ring 50 is mounted in bearing means 60 located in an outer housing 30, 32 of the nut assembly 14 so that it can rotate freely. Rolling line contact is established between the lead screw 12 , the rollers 40 the ring 50 and the outer housing 30,32 for the transmission of major forces in the axial direction of the lead screw.
