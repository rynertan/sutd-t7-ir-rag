# Resistor compositions, methods of making them and articles comprising them.

## Abstract
This invention is concerned with resistor compositions, methods of making them and articles comprising them. The resistor compositions comprise solid long chain phenolic resin, liquid short chain phenolic resin and, dispersed therein, a mixture comprising carbon black and graphite particles. The resistor compositions are capable of with standing high humidity conditions without significant changes in resistivity and are capable of low ohmic values without the need to use metals.
