BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS An embodiment of the present invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a frontal view of an oil burner head, Figure 2 is a cross sectional view on the line II II of the oil burner head shown in Figure 1, Figure 3 is a front view of the radiation shield and some of the vanes in the nozzle of Figure 1, Figure 4 is a side view corresponding to Figure 3 to illustrate said vanes, and Figure 5 is a diagrammatic flat layout of the arrangement ofFigure 4. DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Referring to the Figures and particularly to Figures l and 2, the oil burner head includes a nozzle 2 for spraying oil under pressure and a first nozzle surrounding tubular member 4 which surrounds and is coaxially spaced from the nozzle 2 to form a nozzle space. The tubular member 4 is open at the downstream end 6 thereof. A second nozzle surrounding tubular member 8 having a diameter larger than the tubular member 4 is provided coaxially located with respect of the tubular member 4 and the nozzle 2. primary air passage 10 is thus formed between the first tubular member 4 and the second tubular member 8. A third nozzle surrounding tubular member 12 is provided of a larger diameter than the tubular member 8 and located coaxially therewith. Thus a secondary air passage 14 is provided between the second tubular member 8 and the third tubular member 12. A first set of annularly arranged deflector vanes 16, sometimes called fins, is provided in the primary air passage 10 to impart a swirling action to air passing through the primary air passage whilst a second set of annularly arranged deflector vanes 18 is provided in the secondary air passage 14 to impart a swirling action in the same rotational direction to air passing through the secondary air passage. The arrangement of the vanes, and the corresponding dimensions, is such that two hollow cylindrical volumes of air exit the primary and secondary air passages with a tangential velocity, due to the angle of the vanes in the respective passage. The velocity of the two air volumes is different, due to the different dimen sions and restrictions in the two air passages7 and this results in a cylindrical region of shear between the two air flows causing significant turbulences. The air meeting the oil in this region of turbulence combined with the rotational velocity of the air produces excellent mixing between the air and the oil from nozzle 2 and a radial movement of the oil droplets.This is due to the centrifugal force acting on the oil droplets and to the radial velocity of the air volume as a result of the lower pressure farther from the longitudinal axis 20 of the oil burner head.Thus there is produced a hollow cone of oil which is well mixed with slightly more than the stoichiometric quantity of air and this produces clean combustion and excellent furnace efficiency. The lead angles of the first and second sets of vanes, 16 and 18, to the normal to the longitudinal axis 20 is in the range of the order of 50 to 600. As will be seen from Figures 1 and 2, a perforated annular disc 22 is provided and this partially blocks, and is radially inwardly spaced from, the downstream end of the first nozzlesurrounding member 4. As shown in Figures 1 and 3, the spacing is obt2ineR by providing the disc 22 with three spacing tabs 24 which are used to weld the disc 22 to the first nozzle surrounding tubular member 4. Thus a space 26 is formed between the disc 22 and the tubular member 4. In use, oil passes through a central aperture 28 whilst air is forced through surrounding perforations 30 in the annular disc 22. The central aperture 28 has a diameter of 0.15 inches whilst the surrounding perforations 30 have a diameter of 0.024 inches.Thirty two surrounding perforations 30 are provided in the disc 22 and these are arranged in two concentric rings as shown inFigures 1 and 3 to substantially reduce the formation of an air void downstream of the nozzle outlet. Around the circumference of the first tubular member 4, at region 21 Figure 2 , four equi spaced entrance slot openings not shown are provided through its circumferential wall from the prizaary air passage 10 to permit air therefrom to enter the nozzle space immediately around nozzle 2 and behind disc 22. Thus, in use, some air flows through the primary air passage 10 and some air flows through disc 22 at the open downstream end of the first nozzle surrounding member 4. It will be understood that, in some cases, one slot opening will be adequate. The disc 22 acts as a heat shield for the nozzle 2 protecting it from radiant heat reflected from the fire pot not shown whilst the air flow through perforations 30 and the gap between the disc and the inner surface of the first tubular member substantially reduces the formation of an air void downstream of the nozzle outlet, the resulting flame being a sun flower shaped flame. In Figure 4 the shape of the vanes 16 can be clearly seen on the external surface of the first tubular member 4. Figure 5 is a rolled out or flat layout corresponding to Figure 4 to illustrate the vanes 16 having a 550 lead angle of fin, i.e. 55 to the normal to the longitudinal axis 20 of the oil burner nozzle in the illustrated practical embodiment. Whilst the perforations 30 have been shown as circular, it will be understood that they might be of different shapes, size or rubber, for example they may be rectangular slots. In different constructed embodiments the number of vanes has been 8 and 12 and it would thus appear that the range in the required number of vanes is relatively large. The oil supply for the oil burner atomizing nozzle 2 is rec along an oil feet line 23 whilst ignition electrodes 25 and 27 are connected to an electrical supply line by way of terminals such as 29 surrounded by a high voltage insulator 31. Whilst a new oil burner may be manufactured with an oil burner head according to the present invention, it has been found that the oil burner head is particularly suitable as a retro fit oil burner head for fitting in existing oil furnaces, and also this new burner or retrofitted oil burner can be installed in most existing furnaces without requiring major modifications to the furnace itself. Most standard house burner can supply the required volute of combustion air at a barrel pressure in the range of 0.25 to 0.35 inches of water which is necessary to achieve the velocities required in the two air passages 10 and 14, so as to provide the turbulence downstream of the outlet of these air passages to obtain the required mixing.The illustrated head provides a twin air passage whereby air is combined with oil spray fron a standard oil burner nozzle to produce a very low carbon soot content clean fire and high carbon dioxide content flue gases. A nozzle adapter with disc 22 may be placed in front of the nozzle with the appropriate perforations and aperture as discussed above. Thus the nozzle is maintained cool on its operation cycle and the disc acts as a radiation shield after burner shut down. Air is metered in the rear of the nozzle adapter tube. It was found that one constructed head would operate with two different nozzle sizes 0.5 U.S. gallons per hour, GPH, and 0.65 US GPH . To build a highly efficient burner head we have found that it is preferable not to have the electrodes in the air path in the blast tube as this changes the smooth air flow input needed for good mixing. The electrodes are inserted through the head outside the secondary tube and set to avoid impingement on them.The air blows the spark into the oil air.spray and keeps the electrodes to a reasonable temperature whilst in operation. It will be understood that the two air flows produce 2 region where there are turbulences of the proper distribution of size with the proper distribution of rotational velocities previously called region of shear so that when the atomized oil enters that region it mixes very well, on a very small scale, with the arr. The perforated disc supplies enough air in the centre to produce an over pressure in that central area to avoid an inflow of the air oil mixture and avoid combustion in that area which would raise the ten srature of the nozzle and also shields the nozzle from the radiant heat of the firepot. As during the combustion of the oil there is almost always enough oxygen, on a microscopic scale, near each molecule of oil, very little free carbon is produced. This is what is called clean combustion. High efficiency is a result of the fact that as the mixing between air and oil is excellent everywhere, where combustion occurs, very little excess air is required to ensure at least stochiometry everywhere where combustion occurs and as a result of that, very little heat is required from the combustion to heat up excess air that has the negative effect of increasing the velocity in the heat exchanger, reducing the time of heat transfer and reducing the total heat per unit of fuel burned that is transferred to either the air or the water that is circulated through the building to be heated. The electrode assembly is not located in the critical air flow path in the head and downstream of the head, but there is still enough room for the high voltage conductors to be installed in the barrel of the oil burner and go through the face of the burner head outside of the air flow. Only the electrodes themselves are placed in the air flow so that the spark is blown in the oil air mixture to ensure immediate ignition. The perforations in the disc are there to 1. allow the oil to be sprayed without impinging on the disc, and without allowing too much radiant heat to be incident on the nozzle 2. produce a sufficiently uniform air flow in front of it so as not to create a low pressure area nor to be too turbulent so as to have detrimental effect on the oil spray. It will be realized that any combination of hole size, configuration or shape that would produce those desired results would be acceptable. A common problem with oil burner heads is the positioning electrodes without disturbing flow of combustion air and without requiring signlficant modifications to oil burners and furnaces which would make them incompatible with existing furnaces. Ignition of the air oil mixture should occur within a fraction of a second after the oil spray has started. This embodiment clearly shows where the ignition electrode assembly can be positioned so as not to disturb the svmmetry of flow of the combustion air hence permit a combustion which is not perturbed by the electrodes, and the location of these is compatible with present oil burner housings. The head illustrated produces a symmetrical sun flower flame which contributes to better mixing of oil with air. It has been found that the described burner head can burn oil at very low oil flow rates using a standard nozzle and with all the advantages previously described i.e. efficiency, cleanliness, compatibility with most existing furnaces and oil burner housings. The nozzles that have been tried had flow rates between 0.4 and 0.65 US GPH but it is expected that the embodiment will work with 0.3 U.S. GPH the lowest flow rate which can be obtained with presently available commercial nozzles.
