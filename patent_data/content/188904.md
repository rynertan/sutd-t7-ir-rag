This invention is further demonstrated by the following examples. This example demonstrates the preparation of N 2,4,6 tribromophenyl maleimide. Into a reaction vessel were added and mixed 100g. 0.303 mole of 2,4,6 tribromoaniline, 68.34g 0.697 mole of maleic anhydride, and 5.16g 0.379 mole of zinc chloride. The resulting mixture was heated at a temperature within the range of from about 139 to 148 C for about 2 hours. The resulting reaction product was extracted with xylene, filtered and water washed. The xylene solvent was removed and the resultant product N 2,4,6 tribromophenyl maleimide was recovered at a yield of about 94 . This example demonstrates the preparation of a poly styrene co maleic anhydride co N 2,4,6 tribromophenyl maleimide copolymer of this invention. Into a one gallon reactor containing 1034.5g of styrene and set at 80 C with agitation was charged over a period of 1 1 2 hours a solution of 2024g of styrene, 133.3g of maleic anhydride, 166.8g of N 2,4,6 tribromophenyl maleimide and 3.75g of benzoyl peroxide. The polymerization reaction was carried with agitation for about six hours until the reactor contents became viscous. Polymerization was terminated by dispersing the reactor contents into a vessel containing about 10g of butylated hydroxy toluene BHT were added. The resulting copolymer was precipitated from isopropyl alcohol, washed with methanol, and dried at 90 C for about 18 hours under vacuum. The recovered copolymer was found to have a a weight average molecular weight of 195,000. Elemental analysis found 15 bromine and 9.1 maleic anhydride. The resulting polymer was dry blended with 4 antimony trioxide, extruded and injection molded. The molded composition was found to have the following properties. This example demonstrates the preparation of a rubber modified poly styrene co maleic anhydride co N 2,4,6 tribromophenyl maleimide copolymer of this invention. A four liter, jacketed stainless steel reactor was used for the polymerization. The monomeric feed consisted of the following amounts of ingredients The monomeric mixture was continuously fed into the top of the reactor at an average rate of about 1.7 lb hour. The polymerization was carried out 110 115 C to about 50 conversion to polymer and the polymer syrup was collected through a dip tube from the bottom of the reactor. The resulting polymer was thinly spread on Mylar resin sheets and was allowed to air dry for 48 hours and for an additional 72 hours at 90 C, under reduced pressure. The resulting copolymer was finely ground using a Wiley Mill. Chemical analysis of the copolymer gave 6.4 maleic anhydride and 20 N 2,4,6 tribromophenyl maleimide by weight. The copolymer was tested and found to have a weight average molecular weight of 230,000 by gel permeation chromotograph and a glass transition temperature of 152 C by DSC.

The resulting molded blend was tested and found to have the following physical properties Molded blends were also tested for flammability in accordance with Underwriters Laboratories UL 94 Test Method UL 94 Standard for Tests for Flammability of Plastic Materials For Parts in Devices and Appliances. UL 94, third edition January 24, 1980 . In this UL 94 Vertical Burning Test, the molded blend test specimen was supported from the upper end, with the longest dimension vertical, by a clamp on a ring stand so that the lower end of the specimen was 1 above the top of the burner tube. The burner was then placed remote from the sample, ignited, and adjusted to produce a blue flame 1 in height. The test flame was placed centrally under the lower end of the test specimen and allowed to remain for 10 seconds. The test flame was then withdrawn, and the duration of flaming or glowing combustion of the specimen was noted. If flaming or glowing combustion of the specimen ceased within 30 seconds after removal of the test flame, the test flame was again placed under the specimen for 10 seconds immediately after flaming or glowing combustion of the specimen stopped. The test flame was again withdrawn, and the duration of flaming or glowing combustion of the specimen was noted. If the specimen dripped flaming particles or droplets while burning in this test, these drippings were allowed to fall onto a horizontal layer of cotton fibers untreated surgical cotton placed one foot below the test specimen. Significantly flaming particles were considered to be those capable of igniting the cotton fibers. The duration of flaming or glowing combustion of vertical specimens after application of the test flame average of 5 specimens with 10 flame applications should not exceed 25 seconds maximum not more than 30 seconds and the portion of the specimen outside the clamp should not be completely burned in the test. Materials which comply with the above requirements and do not drip any flaming particles or droplets during the burning test are classified as V 1 . Materials which comply with the above requirement but drip flaming particles or droplets which burned briefly during the test are classified as V 2 . A V 0 rating is given to materials wherein the duration of flaming or glowing combustion averages less than 5 seconds under the conditions specified above. The results of the UL 94 testing was as follows It will be evident from the foregoing that various modifications can be made to this invention. Such, however, are considered as being within the scope of the invention.
