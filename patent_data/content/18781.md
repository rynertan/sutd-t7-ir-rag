# Method for monitoring arc welding.

## Abstract
A method for lowering the contrast range between a welding arc and its surroundings to permit viewing of an arc welding process. A monochromatic light source 10 is used to illuminate the area surrounding the welding arc 18 and a narrow band interference filter 22 tuned to the wavelength of the monochromatic light 10 is placed in front of a viewing camera 24 . The monochromatic light enhances the arc background while the filter 22 attenuates the arc illumination that reaches the camera for a more desirable contrast ratio so that the arc, weld puddle and surrounding area are visible with a high degree of definition.
