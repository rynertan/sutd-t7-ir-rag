# Printed circuit boards and terminal devices therefor.

## Abstract
A printed circuit terminal device for coupling a terminal array e.g. on a plasma display panel having very fine pitch with lead lines from a circuit portion 71,72 includes a flexible printed circuit board 22 having a terminal array pattern 23 which corresponds to the terminal array and wiring patterns 710,720 which extend alternately from opposite sides of the terminal array pattern 23 so that the pitch of the wiring patterns 710,720 is twice that of the pitch of the terminal array pattern 23 . This allows the circuit portion 71,72 to be coupled easily and reliably to the terminal array having very fine pitch and the formation of the wiring patterns 710,720 can be performed easily and results in an arrangement of very small size. The flexible printed circuit board 22 can be manufactured at low cost and the yield can be increased. Also, circuit elements such as resistors 25 can be mounted on the wiring patterns 710,720 without changing the wiring pitch.
