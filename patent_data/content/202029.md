# Buoy having minimal motion characteristics.

## Abstract
A service buoy 20 e.g. for performing direct wireline maintenance of a subsea will 10 is maintained in position over the well by a rigid riser 3 kept under tension and which allows for the well re entry. A primary buoyant body 22 of the buoy 20 is maintained permanently submerged and a truss structure 24 presenting a minimum surface area to the action of wind and waves extends above the sea level to support a small deck 28 from which the wireline work can be performed. The centers of gravity and buoyancy for the buoy are preferably in close proximity so as to minimise lateral surge and sway motions of the installed buoy.
