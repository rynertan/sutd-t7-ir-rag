# Crimp connector having gel between envelope and crimp body.

## Abstract
An electrical crimp connector includes a plurality of dimples 14 disposed between an outer surface of a crimping body 10 and an inner surface of a polymeric envelope 20 , with an insulating gel 15 being disposed in a space between the crimping body and the envelope formed by the dimples. Upon crimping the connector, the insulating gel is forced into an interior cavity of the connector thus insulating wires 28 bieng crimped.
