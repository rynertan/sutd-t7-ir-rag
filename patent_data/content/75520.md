# PERFORATING GUN INDEXED WIRING HARNESS

## Abstract
A wiring harness for selective perforating guns uses a single harness configuration for all connections. Each harness incre ments the relative positions of the harness conductors, while the conductor used in each ha ness for firing its associated detonator is the same. With diode steering, two harnesses are used, one which increments and one which does not.
