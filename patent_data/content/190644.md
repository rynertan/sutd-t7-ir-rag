# Convertor pressure control device in convertor waste gas disposing device.

## Abstract
A converter pressure control device for use in a conver ter waste gas disposing device wherein a calculator deter mines the difference between the pressure in a converter and atmospheric pressure and sets an operating parameter according to the detected difference. A pressure controller generates a control signal in accordance with the operating parameter and the difference in converter pressure and a predetermined value. The control signal is used to operate a damper to control the flow of waste gas through the converter.
