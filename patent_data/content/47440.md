# Shift circuit.

## Abstract
A shift circuit comprises a plurality of stages of data selectors 40, 42 , a first data selector 52 , a second data selector 54 and a temporary register 58 . The data se lectors 40, 42 shift an n bit input data by m bits which are specified by a shifting amount data and produces a first output data or a second output data. The first and se cond data selectors 52, 54 selectively output the first and second output data in accordance with shift direction. The temporary register 58 comprises n bits for storing a data which is not selected by said first or second data selec tor 52, 54 .
