# Aminoalkanephosphonic acids and derivatives thereof as fungicidal agents.

## Abstract
Branched aminoalkanephosphonic acids and phos phonic acid derivatives. i.e. compounds containing at least one alkyl substituent in the Î± position of the phosphonic group are used as fungicides. They are particularly suitable for control of phytopathogenic fungi and for use as wood preservatives. 1 aminopropanephosphonic acid has been found very effective against several fungi and salts of the acids are also useful. The compounds can be used for exam ple as seed dressing agents and as foliar fungicides and they can be used in compositions with conventional solid and liq uid carriers.
