# Preparation of o carboethoxybenzene sulfonamide.

## Abstract
A process for producing o carboethoxybenzene sulfon amide in high yield and purity comprising reacting saccharin with ethanol and concentrated sulfuric acid to produce a crude crystallized material containing residual saccharin, separating the crude crystallized material and retaining the organic mother liquor and thereafter slurrying the crude material in aqueous buffer or weak base at a pH in the range from about 3.5 to about 7 to remove the saccharin residue therefrom and recovering the pure o carboethoxybenzene sulfonamide. By recycling the mother liquor one can obtain the desired produt in a purity greater than 95 and a yield above 80 .
