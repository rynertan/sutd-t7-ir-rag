# Ink jet printer with bubble driven flexible membrane.

## Abstract
An apparatus and method is disclosed for propelling ink droplets from an ink jet nozzle which uses an expanding bubble as a driving mechanism. Unlike other thermal ink jet devices, the ink itself is not used to provide the driving bubble. Rather a two fluid system is disclosed whereby a flexible membrane 15 is used to maintain separation between a first working fluid and the ink. A bubble is thermally created in the first working fluid which distends the membrane and causes ink on the other side of the mem brane to be expelled from an ink jet orifice 13 .
