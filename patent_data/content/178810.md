# A hollow cathode type metal ion laser.

## Abstract
A hollow cathode type metal ion laser 100 for produc ing white light includes a gas filled tubular envelope 1 and a hollow cathode 3 located within the tubular envelope 1 . The hollow cathode 3 has holes 4 formed in a side wall portion thereof and a bore therein 3a . The hollow cathode type metal ion laser preferably includes a plurality of metal containing reservoirs 7 for diffusing vapour of the metal into the bore 3a through the holes 4 . Each of the metal containing reservoirs 7 forms a portion of the tubular envelope 1 and is preferably disposed next to one of the holes 4 . Further, each of the metal containing reservoirs 7 preferably extends downwardly. Main anodes 5 , one near each of the holes, are preferably disposed one within each of the metal containing reservoirs 7 . The tubular envelope 1 preferably includes sub anodes 6 disposed one within each end portion 1b, 1c of the tubular envelope 1 to confine the metal vapour within the bore 3a .
