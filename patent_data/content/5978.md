# Process for detecting and quantifying an antigen or antibody.

## Abstract
A process is disclosed for detecting or quantifying an antigen or antibody in a sample, in which, in a dilute suspension under agitation, the rate of aggregation of antibody coated particles or antigen coated particles as measured by an increase in light transmission is a function of antigen or antibody concentration. Preferably, the particles which are coated are latex particles. The process can be applied as an immunoassay technique in which one or both of antigen and antibody concentrations may be determined by use of latex agglutination aggregometry. The process of the present invention is more sensitive than conventional slide agglutination techniques.
