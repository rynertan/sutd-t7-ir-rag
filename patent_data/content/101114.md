## Abstract
An apparatus for detecting deposition of ice or the like on a surface, comprising a vibrator to be caused to vibrate by means of an electrical vibration source mounted on the surface. The vibration source comprises a sweeping oscilla tor having a frequency f which periodically varies within a range f₁..f₂ in which the resonant frequencies f
