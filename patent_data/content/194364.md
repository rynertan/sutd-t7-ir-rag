# Motor vehicle camping device.

## Abstract
A camping device 10 is especially adapted for various compact vehicles having a hatchback design. The device includes a platform and a flexible bag. The platform rests upon the vehicle floor, which may be formed by the fold down rear seat. The platform has a portion which extends beyond the rear of the vehicle, thereby effectively increasing the vehicle length and accommodating adults for sleeping purposes. The flexible bag has an open end which easily fits over the platform and the raised hatchback rear door to provide an enclosed and enlarged interior within the car. An elastic band 23 27 or other suitable sealing means is provided on the flexible bag substantially near the open end thereof. When the bag is placed on the car, the elastic band is disposed forwardly of the hinge for the hatchback door thereby effectively protecting the occupants against rain or inclement weather. The flexible bag may be formed by a plurality of sections joined by respective elastic bands. This allows the bag to be used with a variety of cars or other vehicles having different sizes or shapes.
