# Sterile docking process, apparatus and system for thermoplastic resin tubes.

## Abstract
A process, apparatus and system for making a sterile connection between two thermoplastic resin tubes 11, 12 is disclosed. The process comprises forming a continuous molt en seal simultaneously between an end of a hot, multi ended, hollow needle 19 and a wall of each of said tubes 11, 12 , thereby providing fluid communication, and cooling said seals and needle. As the thermoplastic resin cools a sterile weld is formed.
