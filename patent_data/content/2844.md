## Description
A CLAMP BINDER This invention relates to clamp binders of the type yenerally defined in the introductory clause of claim 1, such binders being mountable e.g. on the constricted end portions of bags or of sausage casings in order to close the same. Espacially as far as sausages are concerned the binding should be effected under well controlled force conditions, because a relatively high clamping force is necessary for making the binder hold on the slippery sausage casing, this espacially applying to the sausage end in which the binder is combined with a suspension member for the suspension of the sausage during the following smoking treatment thereof.On the other hand the binding force should not be so high as to cause damage to the casing. Since the casing material in the constriction area is not resiliently compressible to any substantial degree and not of any exactly constant thickness from casing to casing it is preferable to mount the binder by applying a well controlled clamping force to the binder parts and then fix the parts to each other in their mutual final positions as obtained by said clamping force, as also disclosed in my copending ceeen patent application No. 26 56 581. The binder of the earlier proposed type initially referred to comprises a U member which is pushed over the constriction from one side thereof so as to have its free legs introduced through an aperture in a cross member located adjacent the opposite side of the constriction. In said final position of these two parts the leg ends projecting beyond the cross member are forced away from each other by introduction of a wedge member therebetween, and thereby the legs of the U member are locked against retraction from the cross member. This is a simple mechanical way of fixing the clamp binder in its final position, but in mass production of sausages or similar articles to be bound it is difficult to handle the three individual binder elements, viz. the U member, the cross member and the wedge member. It is the purpose of this invention to provide a binder of the type in question which is easy to handle and yet efficient in use. The binder according to the invention is characterized by the features stated in the characterizing clause of claim 1, i.e. there is provided a binder of the said wedge lock type in which the wedge member is integrated with the Umember in such a manner that when the U member and the cross member have reached their final mutual positions the wedge member will automatically assume its correct initial position for thereafter being displaceable into its locking position.Thus, the wedge member should not be supplied and guided to the mounting place as a separate element, and hereby the mounting work is highly facilitated. It is an outstanding feature of the invention that the wedge member may be provided as two half pieces releasably associated with the respective leg ends of the U member, whereby a very advantageous binder is achieved. In the following the invention is described in more detail, by way of example, with reference to the drawing, in which Figs. 1 4 are views illustrating a relevant prior proposal of a clamp binder, while Figs. 5 8 are illustrative of a preferred embodiment of the invention and of the method of mounting the binder. For facilitating the understanding of the invention reference is first made to the prior proposal as illustrated in Figs. 1 4. This binder comprises a U member 2 having a base portion 4 and two leg portions 6, a cross member 8 having an aperture 10, and a wedge member 12. In use, the cross member 8 is placed at one side of the material portion to be bound, e.g. a portion of a sausage casing, and theU member 2 is introduced over this portion from the other side thereof, such that the legs 6 are pushed through the aperture 10 and the said material portion is confined between the legs 6 and between the U member base portion 4 and the front side of the cross member 8, as will be particularly clear from Fig. 4 illustrating the final binding result.By this mounting the cross member 8 may be backed by a support 14 while a pressing force P is applied to the outside of the U member base portion 4 Fig. 2 . When the parts have come to rest in their mutual positions as obtained by the pressure P the wedge member 12 is urged inwardly in the space between the U member leg portions projecting beyond the cross member 8 Fig. 2 , whereby these leg ends are forced away from each other Fig. 3 , i.e. they are bent outwardly and stabilized by the wedge member so as to be locked against retraction through the aperture 10.Preferably the wedge member is pushed into such a position, as given by the geometric location of its rear side and the known length of the wedge member that the front side thereof will be flush with the front side of the cross member 8 in the final position, whereby the sausage constriction will not be further clamped between the wedge and the U member base portion 4. The dimensions of the various parts are so adapted that in the final position of the wedge member a very firm holding effect against retraction of the U member legs will be obtained, irrespective of the individual entrance depth of the legs relative the cross member 8.Upon the wedge member 12 having reached its final position the rearwardly protruding ends of the legs 6 may be cut, e.g.flush with the rear side of the wedge member, by cutter means not shown, and the final result may be as shown in Fig. 4. Here, and as shown in dotted lines in Fig. 1, the cross member 8 is provided with an integrally formed suspension eye member 16. Preferably the different parts are produced as cast plastic members, e.g. in Nylon, whereby the suspension eye 16 is easily provided as an integral part of one of the elements of the clamp binder. As shown, the cooperative surfaces of the U member legs and the wedge member may be shaped with teeth or otherwise being rough for ensuring a firm frictional engagement therebetween. Now, the binder according to the invention as illustrated in Figs. 5 8 is used in a similar manner with the very important exception that the wedge member is not a separate element which should be separately guided, e.g.from a wedge member magazine, into the correct position in the mounting area. In the binder according to the invention the wedge member is associated with the U member leg ends so as to be introduceable through the cross member aperture 10 along with the leg ends and thereafter automatically assume its correct starting position for being pushed towards its locking position. Fig. 5 illustrates a plastic casting comprising several of the elements to be used for binders according to the present invention. The cross member 8 is the same as the corresponding element discussed above, and it is shown that one or some of the cross members of the casting may be shaped with an integral suspension eye member 16. It also appears that the U members 2 are shaped generally as discussed above, though with each of the outer leg ends being associated, through a thin strip portion 18, with a generally crosswise disposed half wedge member 20 projecting both inwardly and outwardly relative to the location of the said strip portion 18. In use, when the U member 2 of Fig. 5 is caused to be pushed over a material portion such as a sausage casing constriction, the first thing to happen is that the inwardly projecting parts of the half wedge elements 20 will engage the material portion, whereby the elements 20 will be tilted about the strip connector portions 18 so as to get turned into general alignment with the respective U member legs 6, the outer leg ends being provided with a recess 22 in the interior side suitable for receiving the respective innermost portion of the element 20 such that thereafter, as shown in Fig. 6, the half wedge elements 20 will generally constitute outermost prolongations of the U member legs 6. Therefore, when the U member 2 is pushed over the said material portion, e.g. guided by inclined guiding plates 24 as shown in Fig. 6, the half wedge elements 20 will be introduced through the cross member aperture 10 as leading end portions of the U member leg ends, and the final position, compared with Fig. 2, will be as shown inFig. 7. Thereafter a pressing member 26 is forced against the rear surfaces of the half wedge members 20 Fig. 7 , whereby the thin strip connections 18 will be broken and the half wedge members 20 will be moved towards the cross member 8, thereby joining themselves into a wedge member 12 as shown in Fig. 8, but otherwise behaving just like the wedge element 12 of Figs. 1 4. The interengaging surfaces of the two half wedge elements 20 may be provided with interlocking tongue and groove means as shown in dotted lines at 28 in Figs. 7 and 8, whereby a firm engagement between the two wedge half pieces will be secured. When, as shown, holding teeth are provided between the cooperating surfaces of the combined wedge member 12 and the inside of the U member legs 6, a firm engagement between the two half wedge members 20 will ensure that the combined wedge member 12 will be held in a well defined position even if the combined wedge member is in holding engagement with the teeth of only one of theU member leg ends.
