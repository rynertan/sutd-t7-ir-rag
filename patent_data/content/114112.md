# METHOD OF MOUNTING AN ECCENTRIC TOOL RETAINER TO A DIE SHOE

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method of mounting a tool re tainer plate 12 for a punch or die tool 16 to a die shoe 14 , the retainer plate having bolt holes 18, 20 for receiving bolts therethrough for attaching it to the die shoe, a bore 30 in the plate including a ball lock 48, 50, 52 for receiving the tool, a first dowel pin hole 36 being concentric with the bore and a second dowel pin hole 54 being spaced therefrom along a re ference line for locating the bore 30 relative to the die shoe. The method includes the steps of first preparing the die shoe by selecting a location on the die shoe including a point to coin cide with the centerline of the bore 30 and selecting a line, corresponding in orientation to the reference line, extending through that point to determine the orientation of the retainer, drilling a first hole 38 in the die shoe coinciding with the said point for receiving the first dowel pin, drilling a second hole 56 in the shoe on the line for receiving the second dowel pin, drill ing and tapping mounting holes 22, 24 in the shoe for receiv ing the attaching bolts, inserting the first and second dowel pins into their respective holes, placing the retainer plate on the shoe such that the first and second dowel pins engage the cor responding dowel pin holes in the plate, and threading the bolts through the mounting holes to secure the plate to the shoe.
