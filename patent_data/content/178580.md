## Description
INTERMEDIATES FOR THE SYNTHESIS OF CARBOXYLIC ACIDSThis invention relates to ketals of alkyl aryl ketones and their use in the preparation of alpha arylalkanoic acids.Alpha arylalkanoic acids or their derivatives possessing pharmaceutical activity or useful as intermediates in the preparation of antiparasitics are known to be produced when ketals of alkyl arylketones functionalised in the alpha position in the alkyl part are subjected to a rearrangement reaction.The rearrangement methods include those described in European patent applications 34871 Blaschim , 35305 Blaschim , 48136 Sagami , 64394 Syntax , 89711 Blaschim and 101124 Zambon , in Italian patent applications 21841 A 82 Blaschim and CUR , 22760 A 82 Zambon and 19438 A 84 Zambon and in the publication J. Chein. Soc., PerkinI, 11, 2575 1982 .The ketals used as the starting substances in the aforesaid patent applications are exclusively the products of the reaction between suitable alkyl aryl ketones and aliphatic alcohols or glycols, ie alkanediols or alkenediols.The alpha functionalisation, which enables the transposition reaction to be carried out, can be effected either at the ketal level or at the ketone level, ie before the ketalisation reaction.We have now discovered new ketals, the subject matter of the present invention, of formula EMI2.1 in which Ar represents an aryl, possibly substituted R represents a C1 C4 alkyl X represents a hydrogen, chlorine, bromine or iodine atom, a hydroxyl, or an acyloxy, alkylsulphonyloxy or arylsulphonyloxy group n represents 0 or 1, where if n O one of R1 and R2 represents a CH20H group and the other represents a hydrogen atom, and if n 1 both R1 and R2 represent hydrogen atoms.On rearrangement, the compounds of formula I form the corresponding alpha arylalkanoic acids or their immediate precursors.The compounds of formula I are prepared by reacting glycerin with a ketone of formulaEMI2.2 in which Ar, X and R have the meanings given for formula I.The ketalisation reaction can be conducted by conventional methods, using azeotropic distillation or chemical agents to remove the water which forms during the course of the reaction.Alternatively, the reaction between the glycerin and the ketone of formula II can be conducted in the presence of thionyl chloride in accordance with the method described in the copending Italian patent application 7205 A 84 in the name of the present applicant. The compounds of formula I can also be prepared by reacting the ketone of formula II with other compounds which with regard to the preparation of the compounds of formula I can be defined as glycerin analogues.These glycerin analogues comprise 2,3 epoxy propan l ol, 2,3 epoxyl chloropropane then transforming the chloromethyl group into hydroxymethyl and glycerol carbonate 4 hydroxymethyl 2 keto 1,3dioxolane .Useful precursors of the compounds of formula I are also the O 2,3 dihydroxypropyl derivatives of the enolethers corresponding to the ketones of formula II.The compounds of formula I can also be prepared by transacetalation, ie by reacting ketals for example dimethylketals of the compounds of formula II with glycerin.The aforesaid reactions are known, but only in relation to the preparation of acetals of aldehydes or of hexafluoroacetone Synthesis, 501, 1981 .The ketalisation reaction can lead to the formation of 5 or 6 term cyclic ketals of formula I A and I B respectively EMI3.1 The ketalisation reaction generally leads to the formation of mixtures of ketals of formula I A and I B. If required, even though not necessary for the preparation of alpha arylalkanoic acids, it is possible to prepare the individual compounds of formula I A or I B by protecting one of the glycerin hydroxyls before the ketalisation reaction, and deprotecting the hydroxyl when the ketal has been formed.The compounds of formula I A comprise two asymmetric carbon atoms in the cyclic structure, and a third asymmetric carbon atom is present when the substituent X is other than hydrogen. They can therefore exist in the form of four pairs of enantiomers.The compounds of formula I B can exist in the form of two geometric isomers. Furthermore, when X is other than hydrogen an asymmetric carbon atom is present, and thus each of the two geometric isomers can be present in the form of one pair of enantiomers.Both the compounds of formula I A and the compounds of formula I B and their respective stereoisomers form the corresponding alphaarylalkanoic acids on rearrangement.It is therefore unnecessary to separate the ketalisation products for the rearrangement reaction, and they can be used as such even in the form of the mixture.Thus the present invention covers both the mixtures of compoundsI A and I B and their respective sternoisomers obtained by synthesis or by a balancing reaction, and the compounds pertaining to a single structure, obtained for example by chromatographic separation.Likewise, the invention also covers both the mixtures of the various stereoisomers obtained by the synthesis, and the mixtures or the individual isomers obtained by separation, including partial separation.The compounds of formula I in which X is H or OH are intereediates for the preparation of the other compounds of formula I, which are prepared by halogenation or by acylation in accordance with known methods.The compounds of formula I in which X is other than H and OH form the corresponding alpha arylalkanoic acids on rearrangement.The compounds of formula I in which X is other than H and OH can be rearranged to alpha arylalkanoic acids by applying the procedures described in the known art. Depending on the reaction conditions, either the acids are obtained directly or their immediate precursors such as esters which on hydrolysis form the required acids.The ketals of formula I in which X is a halogen atom are of more immediate preparation, by the ketalisation of an alpha haloketone of formula II in which X is halogen or by the halogenation of a ketal of formula I in which X is H. Exclusively for this reason, the compounds of formula I in which X represents a hydrogen, chlorine, bromine or iodine atom represent a preferred species of the invention.These ketals can be rearranged in accordance with the methods described in the literature.It is however preferably to conduct the rearrangement reaction in a protic polar medium which can be the glycerin itself in a neutral or slightly alkaline environment, possibly in the presence of an inert diluent as described in Italian patent application 22760 A 82 Zambon and in European patent application 101124 Zambon .The preference for this rearrangement method is due to its practical advantages in terms of its ease of execution and of the fact that it does not require the presence of metal salts as catalysts.The compounds of formula I also possess an important property not shared by the known ketals used as intermediates in the preparation of alpha arylalkanoic acids.This property is that they are able to form alpha arylalkanoic acids or their immediate precursors by an autosolvolytic rearrangelent reaction.This means that by heating a ketal of formula I in which X is other than H and OH, either in the absence or in the presence of an inert diluent, the corresponding alpha arylalkanoic acid or one of its immediate precursors is directly obtained.The main alpha arylalkanoic acids known for their pharmaceutical properties or as intermediates in the synthesis of antiparasitics include 2 4 isobutylphenyl propionic acid known as Ibuprofen, 2 Ophenoxyphenyl propionic acid known as Fenopren, 2 2 fluoro 4diphenylyl propionic acid known as Flurbiprofen, 2 4 2 tbienyl carbonyl phenyl propionic acid known as Suprofen, 6 methoxy 2naphthyl propionic acid of which the S isomer is known as Naproxen and its 5 bromo 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl propionic and 5 chloro 6 methoxy2 naphthyl propionic precursors, and 2 4 chlorophenyl 3 methyl butyric acid and 2 4 difluoromethoxyphenyl 3 methylbutyric acid, these latter two being useful as intermediates in the preparation of antiparasitics.Consequently specific meanings of the substituent Ar comprise 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl, 5 bromo 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl, 5 chloro 6methoxy 2 naphthyl, 4 isobutyl phenyl, 4 chlorophenyl, 4 difluoromethoxy phenyl, 3 phenoxy phenyl, 4 2 thienylcarbonyl phenyl and 2 fluoro 4 diphenyl, and the specific meanings of R are methyl and isopropyl.The present invention is illustrated in detail hereinafter by gleans of the following examples.
