# Combined clamping and cutting system for moving filament.

## Abstract
An apparatus and method are provided for winding an ad vancing filament 16 or the like being fed by a transfer device. The filament is clamped to a rotating winding wheel 20 and the filament leader is cut for disposal. The apparatus includes a combined clamping and cutting element 52 mounted for rota tion with the wheel 20 . The element 52 includes a pivotable arm 56 having a free cutting knife 58 facing the direction of filament travel. When actuated, the arm 56 pivots from an open position away from the wheel 20 to a closed position wherein the arm 56 engages the filament 16 and the wheel 20 so as to retain the advancing filament on the wheel. Fol lowing clamping engagement the rotating brush rollers 22 pull the filament leader forcing the filament 16 against the cutting edge as the wheel 20 continues to rotate so as to cut the filament leader. The method includes the steps of tension ing the filament as it is drawn past the wheel clamping the fila ment to the wheel and pulling the filament against the free cut ting edge as the wheel rotates following clamping engagement so as to cut the leader for removal.
