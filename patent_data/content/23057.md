## Description
70CUSS FOR PREPARING PHOSPHATES AND A URLNIU CO JTAIIG CONCENTRATE ROM IirET PROCESS PHOSPHORIC ACID, AS WELL AS PHOSPHATES AND URANIUMCONTAINING CONCENTRATE OBTAINED WITH APPLICATION OF THIS PROCESS The invention relates to a process for preparing phosphates and a uranium containing concentrate from wet process phosphoric acid, in which the phosphoric acid is treated with an inorganic fluorine compound in the presence of an organic dispersant and a reducing agent, the resultant uranium containing precipitate is separated out, and the dispersant is recovered from the remaining mixture of phosphoric acid, dispersant and water. Such a process for obtaining a uranium containing concentrate is described in the non prepublished Dutch Patent Application No. 7900581. The main product obtained by that process is a purified phosphoric acid, by separation for instance through distillation, of the mixture of phosphoric acid, organic dispersant and water, after which the dispersantwater mixture, freed of water and impurities, may be recirculated. The recovered, purified phosphoric acid can be used for a variety of purposes, for instance as basic material for production of high grade fertilizers, technicalgrade phosphates and animal feed phosphate. If this process is applied for preparing phosphates, the phosphoric acid is thus first separated from the dispersant, an operation which requires energy and investments, and the phosphoric acid so obtained is converted into phosphates, in some cases after concentrating.Also, it has appeared that in the case of separation through distillation, impurities left in the mixture of phosphoric acid, dispersant and water, such as metal and fluorine compounds, remain in the phosphoric acid. The invention now provides a process offering the possibility of preparing phosphates direct from a mixture of phosphoric acid, dispersant and water. According to the invention, this is achieved by adding to the mixture of phosphoric acid, dispersant and water a compound which reacts with phosphoric acid to form a phosphate which is insoluble in the dispersant water mixture, and separating the precipitated phosphate from the dlspersant water mixture. An advantage of this process is that a substantial portion of the impurities left in the mixture of dispersant, phosphoric acid and water remains in the dispersant water mixture upon precipitation of the phosphate.Moreover it has appeared that the solubility of many phosphates in the system of phosphoric acid, dispersant and water is considerably less than in the system. of phosphoric acid and water. This makes it possible in the process according to the invention to produce highly concentrated phosphates direct from a mixture of dispersant and phosphoric acid which still contains a substantial quantity of water without, as is usual in the known processes for conversion of phosphoric acid into phosphates, having to concentrate the phosphoric acid first.Thus it is possible, for instance, to produce highly concentrated ammonium phosphate direct from a mixture of acetone and phosphoric acid with a P205 content of about 28 b by wt. by introducing ammonia, while in the known preparation of ammonium phosphate by ammoniation of phosphoric acid, the acid started from is required to have a P205 content of 40 45 by wt The compounds reacting with phosphoric acid to form insoluble phosphates are, by preference, besides ammonia, soluble ammonium compounds, such as ammonium hydroxide or carbonate, soluble compounds of alkali or alkaline earth metals, such as hydroxide or carbonate of sodium, potassium or calcium, and urea.The products obtained then are, respectively, an ammonium orthophosphate, such as mono or diammonium orthophosphate, alkali phosphates, such as orthophosphates of sodium or potassium, phosphates of alkaline earth metals, such as di calcium phosphate, and urea phosphate. It is also possible to use t cor more of said substances in combination. The compounds reacting with phosphoric acid to form phosphates can be added in various forms. The ammonia, for instance, may be added in a gaseous, liquid as well as dissolved form. The above mentioned salts and hydroxides of ammonia, alkali or alkaline earth metals may be added in a solid form or in the form of a solution.Urea may also be added solid, molten or as a solution.When using compounds of ammonia and alkali earth metals as precipitation agent, virtually quantitative separation of the P205 from the mixture is achieved. When using urea as precipitation agent, a P205 precipitation efficiency of 50 70 is achieved. The temperature during the precipitation may be varied.The use of lower temperatures is advantageous in that the solubility of the phosphate is also lower. However, when using certain compounds of ammonia and alkali earth metals as precipitation agent, an exothermic reaction occurs, releasing a rather considerable amount of heat.This heat generation can be dissipated, in principle, by cooling of the reaction mixture. It is also possible, however, to utilize this heat for evaporation of part of the dispersant during the precipitation, provided that this does not cause the viscosity of the mixture to increase excessively. This excessive increase can be suppressed by carrying out the precipitation at elevated pressure, so that evaporation of the dispersant is not effected until in a later stage of the process. The precipitated phosphate can be separated from the dispersantwater mixture in various ways, for instance by filtration, centrifugation, decantation. The recovered phosphate can be processed further in a known way, for instance washed with virtually inert liquids. The phosphates obtained by the process according to the invention contain only a small quantity of residual impurities. Except as component of high grade fertilizers, they can be used direct, therefore, in many technical applications.It has been found that when urea is used for precipitation, urea phosphate of such purity is obtained that it is suitable for direct application in the animal feed industry. In precipitation of urea phosphate according to the invention, the P205 precipitation efficiency is about 50 70. It has been found that this precipitation efficiency can be enhanced by adding sulphate ions, for instance in the form of sulphuric acid, to the mixture of 3phosphoric acid, dispersant and water.The mixture of phosphoric acid, urea, dispersant, water and impuritie resulting upon recovery of the precipitated urea phosphate, can be treated further in various ways. For instance, the dispersant may be separated out, and the remaining liquid processed into a suspension fertilizer through addition of ammonia and a stabilizing agent.However, this fertilizer then contains most of the impurities present in the original mixture.It is also possible to separate the dispersant from the mixture and then evaporate the remaining water, so that a urea phosphate melt is obtained. This, too, then contains most of the impurities originating from the wet process phosphoric acid which were originally present in the mixture. Preferably, therefore, the urea present in the remaining mixture is hydrolized at elevated temperature into ammonia and carbon dioxide. This ammonia reacts with the phosphoric acid to form ammonium phosphate which is insoluble in the system. In some cases, an extra quantity of ammonia may be added depending on the quantity of urea originally used, and the desired ammonium phosphate. The resultant precipitated ammonium phosphate may be separated from the dispersantwater mixture in a known way as indicated above. The dispersant water mixture remaining after recovery of the phosphate can be treated further in a known way, for instance rectifiec for removal of water and impurities, and used anew for the uranium precipitation. It is also possible to use only part of the mixture of phosphoric acid, dispersant and water according to the invention for recovery of a phosphate, and to process the remaining portion of the mixture into phosphoric acid, for instance through distillation. The process according to the invention may be used for treatment of mixtures of phosphoric acid and uranium containing concentrate obtained with application of various inorganic fluorine compounds as uranium precipitation agent, and various organic dispersantThe inorganic fluorine compound used is preferably ammonium fluoride.The inorganic dispersant used may be for instance, water miscible alcohols ketones, ethers, carboxylic acids and or carbonitrilas, The combination of ammonium fluoride and acetone or methanol has appeared to be highly advantageous. The reducing agent for reducing the uranium from the hexavalent to the tetravalent state may be, for instance, powdered metallic iron, zinc or aluminium. It is also possible to make use of electrolytic reduction. It has appeared to be advantageous to add the reducing agent after the inorganic fluorine compound, because then a smaller quantity of precipitate is formed in which the uranium is yet virtually quantitatively present. In principle, the process according to the invention may be applied to each type of wet process phosphoric acid. Both the so called green wet process phosphoric acid obtained from calcinated rock phosphate and the so called black wet process phosphoric acid which contains a certain quantity of impurities can be treated by the process according to the invention without additional pre treatment.The process may also be applied direct to dilute phosphoric acid the so called filter grade acid as well as to concentrated phosphoric acid, and even to so called super phosphoric acids. The uranium containing precipitate formed in the process also contains the greater part of the metals present in the phosphoric acid, for instance magnesium, aluminium, cobalt, vanadium, yttrium, titanium, chromium, strontium, lead and rare earth metals, such as lanthanium, cerium, neodynium and ytterbium. This precipitate may be separated from the mixture of phosphoric acid and dispersant through, for instance, filtration or centrifugation. The recovered uranium containing concentrate can, if so desired, be processed by the various methods known as such.The invention will be further elucidated by means of the following examples.Example 1 100 g of wet process phosphoric acid with a P205 content of 29.0 a by wt. was introduced into a beaker. Next, 4 g of iron chips was added and the mixture was stirred for 30 minutes, after which the iron was removed from the liquid with the help of a magnet. Subsequently, 0.5 g of solid ammonium fluoride and 250 g of acetone were added, after which the mixture was stirred for 1 hour. The resultant precipitate 6 g was filtered off. Analysis showed that more than 90 0 of the uranium present in the crude phosphoric acid had been precipitated. The resultant filtrate was a liquid mixture, consisting of 13.8 0 by wt. of phosphoric acid, 66 by wt. of acetone and 19 70 by wt. of water. In two reactors provided with reflux coolers, this filtrate was treated with gaseous ammonia at a temperature of about 30 C and atmospheric pressure in two steps, viz. up to pH 2 2.5 in the 1st reactor and up to pH 3 3.5 in the 2nd reactor. The retention time in each reactor was about 30 minutes.The mixture from the second reactor was filtered off the filter cake was washed with a little acetone and dried at 50 C for 12 hours.White crystals were obtained, which upon analysis appeared to consist virtually quantitatively of mono ammonium phosphate. More than 99 of the P205 supplied was recovered. The nitrogen efficiency, relative to the ammonia supplied, was 95 Uo. The filtrate remaining after filtering off was distilled, whereby acetone was recovered. The composition of the crude phosphoric acid and of the monoammonium phosphate crystals obtained was determined. The results are given in table I.These results show that a major portion of the impurities originally present in the phosphoric acid is not found back in the mono ammonium phosphate crystals. hole I phosphoric mono ammonium di ammonium acid phosphate crystals phosphate crystals analysis analysis percentage analysis percentage relative to relative to quantity quantity present in present in H3PO4 H3PO4 29.1 wt. 60.6 wt. 100 55.0 wt. 100 12.7 21.2 SO4 2.2 0.70 15.3 0.83 20.0Al2O3 0.33 0.02 2.91 0.01 1.6Fe2O3 0 19 0.20 50.6 0.21 58.5CaO 0.51 0.2 18.8 0.1 10.4 0.53 0.23 20.8 0.23 23.0 3 1.68 0.73 20.9 0.32 10.1SiO2 0.55 0.33 28.8 0.07 6.7Na 0.07 Cl 0.03 H2O 0.02 0.3 mg kg 17 17 11 mg kg 31.1 20 mg kg 62.3As 11 8 38.5Pb 1 Cr 170 28Cu 25Zn 270Mn 10 Example 2 In substantially the same way, the filtrate obtained after filtering off a uranium containing precipitate, of the same composition as in example 1, was treated with gaseous ammonia at a temperatur of about 30 C and atmospheric pressure, but now in three steps, viz.up to a pH of about 2.5 in the first step, up to a pH of about 8 in the second step, and up to a pH of about 9 in the third step.
