Automatic mechanical pencil provided with a chuck which will grip a lead to allow the advance of the same, wherein the lead is kept prevented from retraction when it is pushed back by writing pressure, while the advance move ment of the lead is allowed when it is to be advanced. The chuck is formed by the combination of two chuck elements, which will cooperate to grip the lead at their front ends. In termediate portions of the chuck elements are swingably connected, so that when rear portions of the connection are pushed by a spring, front portions of chuck elements will be opened in the direction of mutual disconnection to release the lead.
