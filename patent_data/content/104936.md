# Lithium oxide based amorphous ionic conductor.

## Abstract
A lithium oxide based amorphous ionic conductor has a ternary composition consisting of Li₂O, SiO₂ and ZrO₂, said composition falling within the range of a quadrilateral on a composition diagram defined by two lines corresponding to the Li₂O contents of 80 and 50 , respectively, and by two lines which pass through the 100 Li₂O apex and on which a ratio SiO₂ ZrO₂ is 100 0.5 and 1 9, respectively. The conduc tor is used as a solid electrolyte in the form of a high ionic conductive amorphous thin film.
