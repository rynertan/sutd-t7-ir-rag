## Description
METHOD AND INSTRUMENT FOR APPLYING AFASTENER TO A TISSUE USING MEANS TO GRASP,GUIDE AND PULL THE FASTENER THROUGH THE TISSUETechnical FieldThis invention relates, in general, to the fastening together of portions of tissue in surgical procedures.Background of the InventionIn various surgical procedures fasteners in the form of staples, and the like, are employed for holding tissue portions together to facilitate healing of a wound or incision. For example, a locking staple having a tongue and groove structure by which the staple is locked, is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 2,881,762. A metal staple, especially adapted for ligating blood vessels, is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,079,608. InternationalPatent Application No. PCT SU79 00d49 discloses a variety of fastening devices and instruments for performing circular aastomosis on the large intestine. The aforementioned disclosures serve as examples for a wide variety of tissue fastening devices and techniques that may be employed in general and or specific surgical situations.One common type of fastening device for joining or holding together soft tissue portions is the generally U shaped staple which is typically fabricated from suitable metals.Such staples, although generally described as having two legs joined by a link to define a U shape when unclinched, may also be regarded as having a configuration of an open loop when unclinched. The legs need not be necessarily parallel but are typically adapted for penetrating the tissue portions and for receiving between them some of the tissue material.Other examples of U shaped or open loop staples as well as methods and instruments for applying said staples to tissue are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,252,643, 3,482,428, 3,692,224, 3,790,057, 3,795,034, 3,889,683, 4,198,982, 4,316,468 and 4,329,576.Other tissue fastening devices have been proposed and differ from staples per se in that these other devices may have a plurality of components that do not have to be clinched in the manner of a metal staple. One such device is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,060,089 and includes a fastener strip provided with a plurality of longitudinally spaced parallel prongs which are adapted to penetrate overlapped tissue portions from one side so that the distal ends of the prongs project from the other side of the tissue portions.The fastener device further includes a retainer strip which is adapted to be placed on the other side of the tissue portions opposite the fastener strip to engage the ends of the projecting fastener strip prongs and to secure the tissue portions tightly between the fastener strip and the retainer strip. The fastener strip prongs each include a plurality of spaced apart engaging members for engaging the retainer strip at the desired position relative to the prongs. This provides for the capability of adjusting the distance between the fastener strip and the retainer strip. Such a fastening device may be fabricated from a bio degradable or absorbable material. other p nàs u.s.PatentNos. 2, 86, 78 and, 3,638,654 plying flexible disclose for s tures with les that are inserted into the ti e portions.Other types of fasteners that include a fastening r. tr with is joined by a link and cured by a retaining receiver on one side of an incision are disposed inU.S. Patent Application Serial Nos. 506,082, 506,083, 506,087, 506,088, 506,145 filed June 20, 1983 and British Patent Application N . 8415622. U.S. Patent o. 4,006,747 discloses the application of a flexible fastener to tissue by means of a slotted hollow straight needle Vith a plunger for pushing the fastener through the needle. The application of a similar fastener in a non surgical situation is disclosed in U.S. PatentNo. 4,215,807. also in European patent application No. 84304134.4 an instrument having a pair of spaced apart needles oriented in generally parallel plaves is dissi sed. Each needle has a discal end adapted for piercing the tissue portions. Each needle is hollow and has a passa e extending along its length from a fastening member receiving opening to a discharge opening at te istal end of the needle. Each needle also has a slot extending é rig its length in communication it the passage and facing the slot of the other needle. According to te method of that patent application, the fastener is applied by first approximating tissue portions in generally face to face relationship. The hollow needles are inserted through the approximated tissue portions to locate the receiving openings on one side of the wound or incision and to locate at least portions of the discharge openings on the other side of the wound or incision, The fastening member is oriented with each of the legs disposed in one of the needle passages and with the link extending through the needle slots between the needles.The fastening member is urged along the needles to locate at least a portion of the link on one side of the incision adjacent to one of the tissue portions and locate a portion of each leg on the other side of the incision where it is restrained by a suitable receiver. The needles are withdrawn and the fastener remains holding the tissue together.Although many of the above discussed types of tissue fastening devices and techniques are satisfactory in various applications, there is a need to provide an improved method for fastening mammalian tissue with reduced trauma. It would also be desirable to provide an improved fastening method for use with fasteners fabricated from absorbable materials that can provide primary approximation of the tissue edges to insure that the tissue edges will not lose contact. The improved method should insure that the staple legs, as they pass through the tissue, fully align with the openings in the receiver. The improved method should eliminate the possibility of misalignment of the staple legs with the openings in the receiver. When misalignment occurs, blind movement of the legs is required until an opening is met, very often causing undue trauma to the tissue.Also, it would be desirable to provide a relatively simple yet effective and rapidly operating instrument for applying a variety of fasteners according to such an improved method.Summary of the InventionA method and instrument for applying a fastener or a group of fasteners to close a wound or incision in mammalian tissue by holding together portions of the tissue defining the wound or incision so as to facilitate healing of the wound or incision. The method can be employed with a variety of types of fasteners comprising at least a fastening member having at least one leg and suitable stop means to prevent that leg from totally passing through the tissue. A preferred fastening member has a pair of legs joined by a suitable link with that link lying against one of the tissue portions on one side of the wound and acting as the stop means. The fastener also includes a receiver having at least ,one opening which is placed on the opposite side of the wound and retains the leg penetrating the tissue.The method requires the use of an instrument having a needle which, at its distal end, has means for guiding and or grasping the leg of the fastening member or staple.The needle may be hollow or it may be solid at least up to the portion that guides and or grasps the leg. The diameter of the needle must be such as to readily pass through the opening of the receiver which is going to accept the leg.When applying a fastener according to the method of the present invention, two or more tissue portions are approximated in a generally face to face relationship. The staple portion of the fastener is disposed on one side of the tissue to be joined and the receiver portion of the fastener is spaced on the opposite side of the tissue to be joined. The instrument having the needle with the guiding and or grasping means is placed so that the needle passes through the opening in the receiver and penetrates the tissue to guide and or grasp the free end of the leg of the staple. The needle is removed through the opening in the receiver by reversing its motion. The leg of the staple is caused to follow the guiding and or grasping needle and the leg of the staple penetrates the tissue.At least a portion of the leg of the staple is passed through the opening of the receiver. The staple leg is guided into the hole in the receiver and aligned therewith. The staple leg is engaged and retained by the receiver and the guiding and or grasping means removed and the fastener remains holding together the tissue portions.This method and instrument may be used for a variety of such types of fasteners. Numerous other features of this novel method and instrument will be apparent from the following detailed description and accompanying drawings.Brief Description of the DrawingIn the accompanying drawings, forming part of the specification, like numerals are employed to designate like parts throughout the same Figure 1 is a cross sectional view of one means for carrying out a method in accordance with the present invention In this figure the means is in the fully opened position Figure 2 is a view in elevation of the means depicted inFigure 1 with the instrument in its first closed position Figure 3 is a view in elevation of the means depicted inFigure 1 with the instrument in its second closed position Figure 4 is a view in elevation of the means depicted inFigure 1 with the instrument in the open position and with the tissue fastening means in place Figure 5 is a cross sectional view of another means for carrying out an alternate method of the present invention with the instrument in its initial open position Figure 6 is a view in elevation of the means depicted inFigure 5 with the instrument in its closed position andFigure 7 is a view in elevation of the means depicted inFigures 5 and 6 of the instrument in its open position again and with the fastening means in place joining the tissue.Detailed Description of the DrawingsIn Figures 1 through 4 there is shown one means for carrying out the method of the present invention. In this embodiment two pieces of tissue 11 and 12 are being joined by a fastening member comprising a staple 14 having a pair of legs 15 and 16 which are generally parallel and connected by a cross piece 17. The fastening member includes a receiver 18 having a pair of holes or openings 19 and 20 for accepting the legs of the staple and locking therewith. As shown in Figure 1 the staples are carried in one jaw 25 of an instrument and may be held in that jaw either by friction or some type of latch means not shown for the sake of clarity . This jaw is placed on one side of the two pieces of tissue to be joined. A second jaw 26 of the instrument is placed on the opposite side of the two pieces of tissue to be joined.This jaw carries a plurality of the receivers with the openings in the receivers disposed directly in line with the legs of the staple. The second jaw includes guiding means 27 which is aligned with the openings or holes in the receivers.The free end of each staple leg is tapered and fits into the open end 28 of the guiding means. As shown inFigure 2, the guiding means is inserted through the openings in the receivers through the tissue to be joined so that the open end of the guiding means 28 contacts the free end of each staple leg 15 and 16. At this point, if the staples are being held in the first jaw by a latch, the latch is released and a pusher means 30 is actuated to push the staple 14 and the guiding means 27 back down through the tissue forcing the legs of the staple into the holes of the receiver 18 to be retained thereby. This step is depicted in Figure 3 of the drawings. At this point, the pusher is released and the guiding means may be removed leaving the fastening members in the tissue as depicted in Figure 4.Referring to Figures 5, 6, and 7 there is shown another means for carrying out an alternative method of the present invention. Again, a two legged staple 40 and an appropriate receiver 41 having openings 42 for retaining the legs 43 of the staple are disposed in opposite jaws 47 and 48 of an instrument and the opposite jaws placed on the opposite sides of the tissue 45 to be joined. The staples are held in spaces in the jaws by friction as are the receivers. The second jaw 48 includes grasping and guiding means 50 which are hollow. The free ends 51 of the hollow grasping and guiding means are aligned with the openings in the receiver. The free ends are sharpened to aid in tissue penetration. The opposite end of the grasping and guiding means is attached to appropriate suction. In operation, the guiding and grasping means are moved to pass through the openings in the receiver, penetrate the tissue, and contact the free ends of the legs of the staple as shown in Figure 6. At this point, suction is applied to the opposite end of the grasping and guiding means and the means then returned to its original position as shown in Fig. 7. This operation pulls the staple along with the grasping and guiding means through the tissue into engagement with the receivers to be retained thereby. At this point, the suction may be removed and the jaws opened to release the tissue which is joined by the appropriately locked staple and receiver.Though staples and receivers having a pair of legs and a complementary pair of openings have been described, it should be appreciated that the fasteners may have single legs or multiple legs and the receivers may have single openings or multiple openings or various combinations of the two. The receiver and the fastening member or staple, when in the final position, should be locked in place and this may be accomplished either by the receiver in some manner grasping on to the staple leg such as by an interference fit or by having means on the staple leg to retain the receiver such as barbed areas and the like as are well known in the art.The staples or fastening members and receivers may be made from various biologically acceptable polymeric materials and these materials may be either of the absorbable type or the non absorbable type. Suitable absorbable materials are made from the polymers and copolymers of the glycolides, lactides, polydioxanones and the like. Suitable non absorbable products can be made from the polymers such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polyester, nylon and the like.The jaws of the means or instruments for applying fasteners may be joined or they may be separate. The jaws may carry one or virtually any number of fastening members and the other jaw may carry one or any number of receivers for those fastening members. The jaws may either have a shape such as to apply the staples in a straight line or in a circular configuration or in any other configuration or shape as desired. The instrument itself may be disposable or it may be of the reusable variety wherein cartridges carrying both the fastening members and the receivers may be placed in the reusable jaws as is well known in the art. The instrument and fasteners should be sterile and, hence, should be made of materials that are readily sterilizable by the well known heat, radiation, ethylene oxide, and similar means for sterilization. From the foregoing, it will be observed that numerous variations and modifications may be effected without departing from the true spirit and scope of the novel concept of the invention. It is to be understood that no limitation with respect to the specific articles, instruments, and methods illustrated herein is intended or should be inferred. It is, of course, intended to cover, by the appended claims, all such modifications as fall within the scope of the claims.
