## Description
INTEGRATED CIRCUIT STRUCTURESDuring construction of an integrated circuit device, it would sometimes be desirable to rework the structure due to some mistake or error in an upper layer.Reworking, rather than scrapping the wafer, would be economically desirable when a number of correctly constructed lower layers have already been applied beneath the problem layer. However, when two or more metallisation layers are already present in the structure and the two layers are in electrical contact with one another due to openings or vias which have already been made through intervening layers, selective removal of the upper metal layer, for example, by etching, without damage to the lower metallisation layer, can be difficult and complicated.For example, Cynkar et al U.S. Patent 4,415,606 describes a process for reworking the upper level metal layer by first forming a photoresist mask to mask the vias leading to the lower metal layer followed by etching of the upper metal layer to remove the unmasked portions of the layer including the defects.When the lower metallisation layer is damaged in attempting to remove the upper metallisation layer, removal of the intervening oxide layers is necessitated as well. However, since the etchants which would be used to remove intermediate oxides would also remove lower oxide portions in underlying transistor structures formed in the silicon wafer, the wafer, in essence, cannot, in such instances, usually be reworked and must be scrapped. There, therefore, exists a need for a construction which will permit the necessary electrical connection between two or more metallisation layers without interferring or inhibiting the subsequent removal of the outermost of the layers if it later becomes necessary to rework the structure.According to the invention there is provided an improved integrated circuit structure wherein a conductive layer, resistant to means for removing metal, is applied between two metallisation layers to permit subsequent selective removal of the upper metallisa tion layer without disturbance to the lower metallisation layer.The conductive layer preferably provides a conductive path between the metallisation layers without introducing any substantially added resistance between the metallisation layers through the conductive path.The conductive layer will also preferably protect the lower metallisation layer from, for example, etchant means, during subsequent selective removal of the upper metallisation layer.The conductive layer also preferably enhances the process of forming further layers over the conductive layer while permitting subsequent selective removal of the upper metallisation layer.In a preferred embodiment of the invention, an improved integrated circuit structure is provided which comprises at least one metallisation layer having applied thereon during production of the structure a conductive layer resistant to means for removing metal and an upper metallisation layer subsequently applied to the structure over the conductive layer wherein at least a portion of the subsequent metallisation layer is in ohmic contact with the conductive layer whereby the lower metallisation layer is protected by the intervening conductive layer during subsequent removal of the upper metallisation layer if subsequent reworking of the structure becomes necessary.The conductive layer also preferably functions as an antireflective coating so that the use of the conductive layer over a metallisation layer further enhances the construction process by the use of its antireflective properties during patterning of a photoresist applied over the conductive layer.In the accompanying drawings, by way of example only Figure 1 is a crosys sectional view of an integrated circuit structure in an intermediate stage of construction showing the conductive layer applied over a first metallization layer.Figure 2 is a cross sectional view illustrating the structure shown in Figure 1 after removal of photoresist and deposition of a subsequent oxide layer and a second metallization layer.Figure 3 is a cross sectional view of the structure shown in Figure 2 after the second metallization layer has been removed.Figure 4 is a cross sectional view illustrating the structure shown in Figure 2 with a conductive layer applied to the second metallization layer in preparation for subsequent application of a third metallization layer.Referring now to Figures 1 3, the invention will be illustrated in a simplified form. In Figure 1, an intermediate stage of manufacturing of an integrated circuit is shown. A metallization layer 10 which may, for example, comprise aluminum is shown applied over an underlying structure 4. A layer 12 of a conductive material has been applied over metallization layer 10, for example, by sputtering to a thickness of at least 500 Angstroms. A layer 14 of photosensitive material or photoresist is then applied over the conductive layer and exposed to a pattern of light through a mask. The photoresist is then developed to remove the exposed portions, and the underlying segments of the conductive layer and metallization layer so uncovered are removed.Conductive layer 12 may comprise materials, such as, for example, indium arsenide and titaniumtungsten. In accordance with the invention, the material used for conductive layer 12 must possess good conductivity and must be resistant to means, such as an etchant, used for removal of a metallization layer subsequently applied over the conductive layer. This permits subsequent removal, for reworking purposes, of a metallization layer placed over conductive layer 12 without disturbance to the underlying metallization layer 10. For example, indium arsenide will withstand a wet etchant, such as an acid etch, capable of removing an underlying metallization layer, such as an aluminum layer, while a titanium tungsten layer will withstand a plasma etch used to remove such an aluminum layer.By way of illustration only, the invention will now be described using an indium arsenide coating for conductive layer 12 which is removable by wet etching techniques.The indium arsenide segments may be removed by treating the indium arsenide with a solution comprising 1 volume part bromine in 100 volume parts acetic acid and 100 volume parts water. The now exposed aluminum is then etched away by conventional wet or dry etching techniques such as, for example, a 202 aqueous KOH solution at 650 C. As shown in Figure 2, an oxide layer 20 may then be applied and then patterned to open a contact 30. A second metallization layer 40, such as another layer of aluminum, is then deposited and patterned.The necessary interconnection or vias between the first and second metallization layers are supplied through the openings in the oxide layer therebetween to provide a contact at 46 between layer 40 and the underlying indium arsenide 12. This, in turn, provides the desired conductive path between first metallization layer 10 and second metallization layer 40. As shown in Figure 2, metallization layer 40 may also be patterned for application of subsequent layers of the integrated circuit structure. During the various construction steps which may occur after application of second metallization layer OO, an error may occur, such as an improperly aligned patterning or overetching, etc., which necessitates reworking including removal of such upper layers as an alternate to scrapping of the wafer including metallization layer 40. Previously, this would have presented a problem because of the direct connection between metallization layers 10 and 40. In accordance with the invention, however, as illustrated in Figure 3, layer 40 may be removed with a chemical etch, such as KOFI, which will not attack the indium arsenide layer overlying first metallization layer 10 at contact point 46. Thus, first metallization layer 10 is protected from the etchant by the presence of intervening indium arsenide layer 12.While metallization layers 10 and 40 have been illustrated as comprising aluminum because of its common usage in the industry, other materials including aluminum alloys and polysilicon may also be used in place of aluminum without any loss in the advantages provided by the invention. The use of the term metallization herein is therefore defined as including not only metals, but other materials as well which, either naturally or because of doping, have a conductivity approaching that of a metal conductor.Similarly, wet etchants other than the illustratedKOH may be used to selectively remove an upper metallization layer without attacking the underlying conductive layer including acids, such as, for example, mineral acids, such as nitric or hydrochloric acid. When acids are use, and particularly mineral acids, it is preferable to etch at about room temperature to avoid damage to other materials on the wafer.When a conductive material, such as titaniumtungsten, is used for conductive layer 12 the use of a plasma etch using chlorine chemistry, i.e., SiC14, C12, or By13, is preferred to remove second metallization layer 40 without removing or damaging underlying metallization layer 10. It should further be noted that, depending upon the type of integrated circuit structure, the use of a material resistant to plasma etching may be desirable in instances where anisotropic etching is preferred over wet etching o prevent attack of the underlying metal from the side rather than from the top.This is of particular value where the via may be misaligned to the underlying or lower metallization layer. It may also be preferred, in such instances to form the oxide over the lower metallization layer and to open the vias through the oxide to the lower metallization layer prior to placement of protective coating 12 thereon. This would compensate for the possibility of misalignment of the vias over the lower metallization layer.The conductive layer should have a minimum thickness of about 500 to 700 Angstroms to provide a sufficient amount of protection chemically for the underlying metallization layer. Since indium arsenide has a resistivity of about 20 milliohms x centimeter, the thickness of the conductive layer, when using indium arsenide, should not exceed 10,000 Angstroms to avoid adding an undesirable amount of resistance to the interconnection of the underlying metallization layer through the indium arsenide layer to the upper metallization layer.When using other materials, the maximum thickness may differ depending upon the resistivity of the material used. For example, when using metals such as titanium tungsten for coating layer 12, the maximum thickness is not so limited because of the use of a metal, rather than a semiconductor. Preferably, however, even when using titaniumtungsten, the thickness of coating layer 12 should be about 700 to 2000 angstroms.In a preferred embodiment, the use of conductive materials, such aq indium arsenide or titaniumtungsten over a metallization layer has an additional advantage due to the antireflective or light absorptive properties of these materials. Thus, patterning of a photoresist layer applied over a metallization layer having a coating of conductive materials thereon having antireflective properties, such as indium arsenide or titanium tungsten, can be done more accurately because of the reduction of the amount of light reflected back into the photoresist due to the presence of the antireflective conductive layer. To make maximum use of this property, however, the conductive coating should be applied to the lower metallization layer prior to the formation of oxide over the metallization layer and prior to via formation.It should be further noted that the use of a conductive layer over a metallization layer need not be limited to a single layer. As shown in Figure 4, second metallization layer 40 may also have a conductive layer 52 thereon in contemplation of subsequent application of a third metallization layer 40 over conductive layer 52. As shown inFigure 4, a further photoresist layer 64 has already been applied and selectively developed over second conductive layer 52 in contemplation of the deposition of further integrated circuit layers including one or more further metallization layers. Thus, the invention provides an improved integrated circuit structure and method of making the structure wherein the inclusion of a conductive layer over a metallizaton layer provides electrical coupling to an upper metallization layer while isolating the two metallization layers to permit selective removal of the upper metallization layer without disturbance of the lower metallization layer thus permitting economical reworking of a defective wafer which may not have been possible heretofore in many instances.
