# Chip on chip type integrated circuit device.

## Abstract
A chip on chip type IC is provided with a checking circuit to check electrically the perfectness of bondings 1 n between the upper chip B and the lower chip A . The checking circuit is composed of two types of circuit one checks the group of bonding pairs 1 n which transfers the signals from the lower chip to the upper chip, and the other one checks a second group of bonding pairs which transfers the signals from the upper chip to the lower chip. By means of a control signal supplied to a control terminal 18 , the checking circuit is switched to an operation mode or to a checking mode. In the operation mode, the checking circuit is separated from the inner circuit or the lower chip and the IC operates normally. In the checking mode, test signal applied to test terminals 17 are transferred to the upper chip B and sent back to the lower chip A , to be compared with the original test signals, thus enabling the perfectness of the bondings to be checked from the lower chip side.
