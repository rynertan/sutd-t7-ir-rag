# Process for the hydrocarbonylation of methanol to ethanol in the presence of added oxygen containing organic compounds.

## Abstract
Ethanol is produced by reacting methanol with carbon monoxide and hydrogen at temperatures in the range 150 to 250 C and pressures greater than 100 bar in the presence of a cobalt catalyst and an additive which is miscible with methanol containing up to 20 w w water, which additive is an alcohol, an aldehyde, a ketone or an ether. Particular additives are n propanol, n butanol, acetone, acetaldehyde, 1,4 dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, di n propylether and diphenyl ether. Optionally the catalyst is promoted with iodine or bromine or preferably both iodine or bromine and an organo phosphorus compound. Other additives such as non polar solvents, acids and derivatives thereof and inert liquids can be incorporated in the reaction mixture.
