The hydrazono substituents pendant from the anthracene 9,10 bis carbonyl nuclei may be the same or different and may be in the syn or anti forms. Additionally, where the hydrogen atoms or other substituents at positions 1, 4, 5 and 8 of the anthracelie nucleus cause restricted rotation of the bonds extending from C9 andC10 of the anthracene nucleus, then the entire units Z N N at the C9 and C10 positions may be either 2 cis both extending out from the same face of the anthracene nucleus or trans extending out from the opposite faces of the anthracene nucleus . The novel compounds of the present invention are obtainable as yellow crystalline materials having characteristic melting points and absorption spectra and which may be purified by recrystallization from common organic solvents such as lower alkanols, dimethylformamide, tetrahydrofuran, methyl isobutyl ketone, and the like. The organic bases of this invention form non toxic acid addition and quaternary ammonium salts with a variety of pharmacologically acceptable organic and inorganic salt forming reagents. Thus, acid addition salts, formed by admixture of the organic free base with one or more equivalents of an acid, suitably in a neutral solvent, are formed with such acids as sulfuric, phosphoric, hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfamic, citric, lactic, malic, succinic, tartaric, acetic, benzoic, gluconic, ascorbic, and the like. Quaternary ammonium salts may be formed by reaction of the free bases with one or more equivalents of a variety of organic esters of sulfuric, hydrohalic and aromatic sulfonic acids. The organic rcagents employed for quaternary ammonium salt formation are preferably lower alkyl halides.However, other organic reagents are suitable for quaternary ammonium salt formation, and may be selected from among a diverse class of compounds including benzyl chloride, phenethyl chloride, naphthylmethyl chloride, dimethyl sulfate, methyl benzenesulfonate ethyl toluenesulfonate, allyl chloride, methallyl bromide and crotyl hromide. For purposes of this invention, the free bases are equivalent to their non toxic acid addition and quaternary ammonium salts The acid addition and quaternary ammonium salts of the organic bases of the present invention are, in general, crystalline solids, relatively soluble in water, methanol and ethanol but relatively insoluble in non polar organic solvents such as diethyl ether, benzene, toluene, and the like. The novel compounds of the present invention possess the property of inhibiting the growth of transplanted mouse tumors as established by the following tests.

The modes con templated for administration are essentially parenteral and intraperitoneal. The pharmaceutical compositions can be in forms suitable for injectable use, which forms include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporanous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. In all cases the form must be sterile and must be fluid to the extent that easy syringability exists. It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi.The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like , suitable mixtures thereof, and vegetable oils. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. The prevention of the action of microorganisms can be brought about by various antibacterial and antifungal gaents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars or sodium chloride.Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by the use in the compositions of agents delaying absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin. Sterile injectable solutions are prepared by incorporating the active ingredient or ingredients in the required amount in the appropriate solvent with various of the other ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the various sterilized active ingredient into a sterile vehicle which contains the basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and the freeze drying technique which yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile filtered solution thereof. As used herein, pharmaceutically acceptable carr ier t includes any and all solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents Fsotonic and absorption delaying agents and the like. The use of such media and agents for pharmaceutical active substances is well known in the art. Except insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatable with the active ingredient, its use in the present compositions is contemplated. Supplementary active ingredients can also be incorporated into the inventive compositions. It is especially advantageous to formulate compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used in the specification and claims herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the animal subjects to be treated, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier.The specification for the novel dosage unit forms of the invention are dictated by the directly dependent on a the unique characteristics of the active material and the particular therapeutic effect to be achieved, and b the limitations inherent in the art of compounding such an active material for the treatment of disease in living subjects having a diseased condition in which bodily health is impaired as disclosed in detail in this specification. The dosage of the principal active ingredient for the treatment of the indicated conditions depends upon the age, weight and condition of the subject being treated the particular condition and its severity the particular form of the active ingredient and the route of administration.A daily dose of from about one to about 100 mg. kg. of body weight given singly or in divided doses of up to 5 times a day embraces the effective range for the treatment of most conditions for which the novel compounds are effective and substantially non toxic. For a 75 kg. subject, this translates into between about 75 and about 7500 mg. day. If the dosage is divided, for example, into 3 individual dosages, these will range from about 25 to about 2500 mg. of the active ingredient. The preferred range is from 2 to about 50 mg. kg. of body weight day with about 2 to about 30 mg. kg. day being more preferred. The principal active ingredient is compounded for convenient and effective administration in effective amounts with a suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carrier in dosage unit form as hereinbefore disclosed. A unit dosage form can, for example, contain the principal active ingre dient in amounts ranging from about 0.1 to about 400 mg., with from about one to about 30 mg. being preferred. Expressed in proportions, the active ingredient is generally present in from about 0.1 to about 400 mg. ml. of carrierIn the case of compositions containing supplementary active ingredients, the dosages are determined by reference to the usual dose and manner of administration of the said ingre dints regression and palliation of cancers are attained, for example, using intraperitoneal administration.A single intravenous dosage or repeated daily dosages can be administered. Daily dosages up to about 5 or 10 days are often sufficient. It is also possible to dispense one daily dosage or one dose on alternate or less frequent days. As can be seen from the dosage regimens, the amount of principal active ingredient administrated is a sufficient amount to aid regression and palliation of the leukemia or the like, in the absence of excessive deleterious side effects of a cytotoxic nature to the hosts harboring the cancer. As used herein, cancer means blood malignancies such as leukemia, as well as other solid and non solid malignancies such as the melanocarcinomas, lung carcinomas and mammary tumors. By regression and palliation is meant arrestingOr retarding the growth of the tumor or other manifestation of the disease compared to the course of the disease in the absence of treatment. Most of the novel compounds of the present invention may be readily prepared as set forth in the following reaction scheme EMI11.1 wherein Z, R1, R2, R3, R4, R5 and R6 are ashereinabove defined. In accordance with the above reaction scheme, an appropriately substituted 9,10 anthracenedialdehyde or diketone III is reacted with a hydrazine derivative of the formula H2N NR1R2 to provide the 9,l0 anthracene bis anthra cene bis hydrazones I . The reaction may be carried out in a lower alkanol in the presence of an acid such as hydrochloric, hydriodic or acetic or glacial acetic acid may be used as the sole solvent usually at the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture. The starting 9,10 anthracenedialdehydes and ketones may be obtained commercially or prepared in accordance with any one of the reaction schemes denominated A and B below wherein R3, R4, R5 and R6 are as hereinabove defined. EMI12.1 In accordance with the above reaction scheme, the anthracene derivative IV suspended in dioxane and concentrated hydrochloric acid and saturated with HCl, is treated with paraformaldehyde at the reflux temperature for 2 6 hours to obtain the 9,10 bis chloromethyl anthracene derivative V .

Certain anthracene bis hydrazones are more readily prepared by methods other than the general method previously outlined. One of these is outlined as reaction scheme C below wherein R3, R4, R5 and R6 are as hereinabove defined.
