## Description
COMPOSITICN FOR TREATING TUMOR CELLS This invention relates to complexes of certain aminoglycosides and natural or synthetic double stranded RNA which are useful in inhibiting the proliferation and migration of tumor cells. The complexes comprise a natural or synthetic double stranded RNA dsRNA and an aminoglycoside having at least 5 ionizable nitrogens, said aminoglycoside and double stranded RNA being present in a molar ratio, aminoglycoside to double stranded RNA phosphorus, of at least 1 1. The complexes are prepared by mixing dsRNA and aminoglycoside in amounts to obtain a complex having the desired molar ratio. Interferon is a naturally occurring antiviral protein produced by most cells upon stimulation by virus infection or other substances recognized as interferon inducers . The potential of interferon as a broad spectrum antiviral and or anti tumor agent has long been recognized. Double stranded RNA dsRNA , whether of synthetic, e.g., polyriboinosinic polyribocytidilic acid poly I poly C , or natural origin, is recognized as an excellent inducer of interferon. Unfortunately, the usefulness of natural or synthetic dsRNA is greatly limited due to its rapid degradation by nucleases present in the sera of various animal species, particularly primates. More significantly, the enzymatic degradation of dsRNA is especially apparent in human serum see, for example, R.J. Douthart and S.G. Burgett, Biochem. and Biophys. Res. Comm. 84, 1978 , 809 815. It is essential, therefore, if dsRNA is to be useful as an inducer of interferon in primates, in particular, humans, that its rapid enzymatic degradation be prevented or substantially diminished. Attempts have been made to promote the interferon inducing activity of dsRNA, for example, by stabilizing it against enzymatic degradation by a variety of approaches. W.E. Houston, C.L. Crabbs, E.L. Stephen, andH.B. Levy, infection and Immunity 1, 1976 , 318 319, report stabilization of poly I poly C against enzymatic degradation using poly L lysine and carboxymethyl cellulose. A. Billiau, C.E. Buckler, F. Dianzani,C. Uhlenaorf, and S. Baron, Ann. N.Y. Acad. Ski,, 173 1970 657 667, report that stimulation of the interferon mechanism in tissue culture by poly I poly C can be enhanced by addition of substances such as neomycin, streptomycin, diethylaminoethyl dextran DEAE dextran , methylated albumin, protamine, histone, and colistin.Neomycin and protamine, each when administered to mice in conjunction with poly I poly C, were shown to have no effect on the yield of circulating interferon.DEAE dextran, on the other hand, showed a definite enhancement of the interferon response from separatelyadministered poly I p oly C. G.P. Lampson, A.A. Tytell, A.K. Field, M.M.Nemes, and M.R. Hilleman, Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. and Med., 132, 1969 212 218, measured the effect of several polyamines used in conjunction with poly I poly C. Of ten polyamines tested, five demonstrated some effect toward the stabilization of poly I poly C in the presence of RNase. Most of the testing was carried out using neomycin with the stated conclusion that the effect of neomycin was entirely limited to in vitro activity in one particular kind of cell and showed no potential for practical utilization in human and animal application either in potentiation of poly I C activity or in reduction of its toxicity. page 217 . J.J. Nordlund, S.M. Wolff, and H.B. Levy,Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. and Med., 133, 1970 439 444, suggest that human plasma is capable of rapid enzymatic degradation of poly I poly C in contrast, e.g., to rabbit serum. They further report the elimination by neomycin of the destructive capacity of dilute 15 human plasma. The literature also describes the use of dsRNA as an anti tumor agent. Heretofore, it has been recognized that synthetic dsRNA inhibits tumor growth in mice H. B. Levy, L. W. Law, and A. S. Robson, Proc.Nat. Acad. Sci., 62, 357 361 1969 is active in the treatment of leukemic mice L. D. Zeleznick and B. K.Bhuyan, Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med., 130, 126 128 1969 and inhibits chemically induced tumorigenesis in mouse skin H. V. Gelboin and H. B. Levy, Science, 167, 205 207 1970 . It has now been discovered that complexes of certain aminoglycosides and natural or synthetic dsRNA exhibit the highly advantageous properties of 1 ability to activate peritoneal macrophages and 2 enhancement of the activity of dsRNA against tumor systems, including highly refractory tumors such as the Madison lung tumor. These complexes exhibit a potentiation of the tumor effect relative to dsRNA alone. More significantly, this potentiating effect is wholly unexpected since it apparently is entirely unrelated to any inhibition to nuclease mediated degradation of dsRNA. This is demonstrated by the fact that the potentiation occurs even in species having low levels of dsRNase, i.e., in those in which there is no demonstrable difference between the peak interferon titers produced by dsRNA alone and that produced by a complex of the aminoglycosides and dsRNA.The dsRNA used in the complexes can be synthetic, such as, for example, poly I poly C, poly A poly U, poly G poly C, and the like. Likewise, and preferably, the dsRNA can be of natural origin. Among the specific sources of natural dsRNA are virus particles found in certain strains ofPenicillium chrysogenum, Penicillium funiculosum,Penicillium stoloniferum, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus foetidus, 06 bacteriophage, and the like. A preferred strain useful in the production of dsR NA is Penicillium chrysogenum. Methods for producing and isolating dsRNA are well recognized in the literature, see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 3,597,318 and U.S. Patent No. 3,582,469. The complexes useful in.inhibiting the proliferation and migration of tumor cells comprise dsRNA and at least one aminoglycoside. The aminoglycosides that are used have at least 5 ionizable nitrogens in their structure. Examples of such aminoglycosides including the number of ionizable nitrogens are neomycin 6 , tobramycin 5 , kanamycin B 5 , gentamycin 5 , apramycin 5 , and the like. Preferably, the aminoglycoside is one having 5 ionizable nitrogens, and, of these, tobramycin and apramycin are highly preferred with tobramycin being the most preferred. The relative amounts of dsRNA and aminoglycoside present in the complexes are defined in terms of the B P ratios in which B represents moles of aminoglycoside and P represents moles of dsRNA phosphorus. Although there is no upper limit for the B P ratio, in order to achieve the desired effectiveness, the ratio must be at least about 1 1. The preferred B P ratio is from about 12 1 to about 1 1, and most preferably, is from about 9 1 to about 6 1. The following represents a general procedure for producing a complex. Lyophilized dsRNA is.dis solved in 0.02M Tris 0.1M NaC1 pH 7.0 buffer. The solution is dialyzed overnight against the same buffer system. The procedure uses baked glassware throughout, and all buffers are filtered through a Nalgene 45 micron filter for sterility. Pyrogen free double distilled water is used for all solutions to minimize any possibility of endotoxin contamination. The concentration of the dsRNA solution is determined from its us spectrum on the following basis 44.7 x OD260 micrograms dsRNA ml. For example, for Penicillium chrysogenum dsRNA, the moles of RNA phosphorus are determined from the optical density OD at 260 nm using an extinction coefficient of 7200. The extinction coefficients of other natural and synthetic double stranded RNA s can be obtained from the literature or determined using standard procedures and this coefficient then used in determining the molar concentration of dsRNA phosphorus. If appropriate, the dsRNA solution can be diluted with pyrogen free buffer to facilitate formation of a complex having the desired B P ratio. A stock solution of the aminoglycoside is prepared using the same buffer used for the dsRNA solution. The molar concentration of the aminoglycoside as free base is calculated. This can be determined a from its known potency value or b from its chemical structure. The pH of the aminoglycoside stock solution then is carefully adjusted to 7.0 using 1N HCl. Aliquots of the dsRNA and aminoglycoside solutions are mixed in amounts to obtain a complex having the desired B P ratio. The complex can be used as is in which case it is incubated for approximately one hour before use.Alternatively, the complex can be isolated and reconstituted in another suitable carrier. The complex is stable in any physiologically acceptable carrier, generally in combination with a supporting monovalent ion concentration of about 0.lM buffered to a pH of about 6.8 to about 7.2. Physiological saline in bicarbonate or phosphate buffer is a preferred carrier. The complexes have wide applicability. Since dsRNA is rapidly destroyed in human serum due to the presence of degrading RNase, dsRNA in that environ has little or no biological activity. These complexes, however, exhibit excellent interferon inducing and macrophage activation properties in conjunction with their anti tumor activity, even in the presence of dsRNA degrading RNase. Thus, these complexes are particularly useful in humans in the presence of human serum RNase. The complexes exhibit a potentiation of the tumor effect relative to dsRNA alone. This potentiation is wholly unexpected since it exists even in the absence of human serum RNase which is shown to degrade dsRNA but not the complexes used in this invention.Desirably, these complexes are particularly useful in adjuvant cancer therapy to inhibit metastatic cancer development. The complexes can be prepared in a variety of pharmaceutical compositions and formulations and can be administered by a variety of conventional routes, such as intramuscular, intravenous, subcutaneous, topical, and intraperitoneal. The compositions can be administered parenterally or intraperitoneally. The pharmaceutical forms suitable for injection include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for reconstitution into sterile injectible solutions or dispersions. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersing medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, pdlyol for example glycerol, propylene glycol, liquid polyethylene glycol and the like , suitable mixtures thereof, and vegetable oils. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be ensured by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, and the like.In many cases, it will be desirable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, sodium chloride, and the like. Prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form can be brought about by the use of agents delaying absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin. Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the complex in the required amount of the appropriate solvent with various of the other ingredients, as desired. For more effective distribution, the complex can be incorporated into slow release or targeted delivery systems such as polymer matrices, liposomes, and microspheres. As noted, the complexes also can be used topically, for example, for the treatment of skin carcinomas. Thus, the complexes can be formulated as ointments, creams, lotions, and the like. In formulating an ointment the complex, for example, is finely dispersed in paraffin. Liquid paraffin, hard paraffin, and wool fat may be included in the ointment base. If a water miscible ointment base is desired, a polyethylene glycol may be included. The complex may also be formulated as a cream, which may be an oil in water type or a waterin oil type. Suitable emulsifying agents for the former are sodium, potassium, ammonium and triethanol soaps polysorbates and cationic, anionic, and non ionic emulsifying waxes. Suitable emulsifying agents for the latter type are calcium soaps, wool fat, wool alcohols, beeswax, and certain sorbitan esters. A preservative usually is desirable in a cream, particularly an aqueous cream. Examples of suitable preservatives, alone or in combination, are chlorocresols, e hydroxybenzoates, and the like. The complex may be formulated as a lotion by dissolving or dispersing it in an aqueous or oily base.Ethanol and or glycerin may be included in the aqueous base. Examples of suitable oil bases are castor oil, vegetable oils, and the like. A suitable preservative may be incorporated in the formulation. As used herein, the term pharmaceutically acceptable carrier includes any and all solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic agents, absorption delaying agents, and the like. The use of such media and agents for pharmaceutically active substances is well known in the art. Except insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatible with the compositions, its use in the therapeutic formulation is contemplated. Supplementary active ingredients can also be incorporated into the pharmaceutical formulations. It is especially advantageous to formulate parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein refers to a physically discrete unit suited as unitary dosages for the subject to be treated. Each unit contains a predetermined quantity of the complex calculated to produce the desired thera peutic effect in association with the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The specific dosage unit form is dictated by and directly dependent upon a the unique characteristics of the particular composition and b the particular therapeutic effect to be achieved. In general, the compositions can be administered to a host in an effective amount as an adjunct to tumor chemotherapy, tumor radiation therapy, and or tumor excision. The composition can be administered at the same time as such therapy or within an appropriate time prior to or subsequent to such therapy. As indicated, the compositions are administered parenterally. Such administration generally will be an amount ranging, for example, from about 5 Vg. to about 500 Vg. dsRNA per kg. of body weight, and preferably, from about 5 Vg. to about 100 Vg. per kg. of body weight, and, most preferably, from about 20 Vg. to about 60 ijg. per kg. of body weight. The following examples are provided to illustrate the instant invention. They are not intended to be limiting upon the scope thereof.

The activity of these complexes against the effects of tumor cell metastasis is demonstrated usingMadison M109 lung carcinoma, a highly refractory tumor system to conventional cytoreductive therapy Marks etal., Cancer Treatment Reports 61, 1459 1470 1977 . This carcinoma can be carried as a transplantable line in syngeneic BALB C mice. The tumor line is available from the tumor bank at Mason ResearchInstitute. The interferon inducing capacity of the complexes is demonstrated by a recognized procedure. In this procedure, dsRNA is dissolved in 0.15M saline 0.02M Tris buffer at a concentration suitable for administration, generally about 20 g. ml. The dsRNA tobramycin complex is prepared by addition to the dsRNA solution of tobramycin in an amount to produce the desired B P ratio. The resulting mixture is incubated for about one hour at room temperature to effect optimal tobramycin dsRNA binding. Four mice are injected intraperitoneally i.p. with the solution generally 0.5 ml. containing a total of 10 ug. of dsRNA whether alone or as the tobramycin dsRNA complex. Sixteen hours following injection, the mice are bled, and the blood is pooled and centrifuged to obtain the serum. Half log dilutions of the serum are made using M199 medium, and the separate dilutions 2.5 ml. are applied to confluent 2 mouse cell cultures in Falcon 25 cm. tissue culture flasks and allowed to incubate for 20 hours. The cultures then are inoculated with vesicular stomatitis virus in 2.5 ml. of Ml99 medium at a virus concentration producing 60 100 plaques per flask. After two hours viral adsorption, the fluid is removed, and M199 agar 65 is applied and allowed to harden. After three days, the flasks are treated with 2 sodium acetate and 3.78 formaldehyde to fix the cells. The plaques are counted, and the amount of interferon is determined on the basis of plaque reduction relative to control plates lacking interferon. One unit of interferon is defined as the reciprocal of the dilution of the interferon solution mouse serum that provides 50 inhibition of virus plaque production. The amount of interferon then is calculated by the product of this determination and the total dilution. The degradative effect of human serum dsRNase on the interferon induclng capacity of dsDXA or dsRNAtobramycin is determined by adding human serum to the solution of dsRNA or dsRNA tobramycin complex. The amount of buffer is appropriately reduced to accomodate the amount of added human serum and to maintain a constant concentration of dsRNA. The resulting mixture is incubated at 370C. for one hour and then placed in ice. The solutions are used within 15 minutes following removal from the 370C. bath.

Run without human serum challenge The activity of the complexes on macrophage activation has been determined according to a recognized procedure. In this procedure, peritoneal macrophages were harvested after 5 days from composition treated mice by peritoneal lavage and purified by adherence on plastic. Approximately 4 x 10 macrophages in 16 mm. wells were overlaid with 4 x i04 P815 cells contained in 2 ml. of Roswell Park Memorial Institute 1640 Medium supplemented with 20 fetal calf serum. All cultures were maintained in a humidified, 5 C02 in air incubator at 370C., and cytotoxicity was assessed at 48 hours on the basis of viable cell counts in a hemocytometer.Triplicate cultures were maintained for each group the mean cell count and standard error S.E. were calculated. Under these conditions, peritoneal macrophages from normal BALB C mice treated with tris buffered saline did not affect the growth of P815 target cells, as measured both by viable cell number and by DNA synthesis of the leukemia cells The ratio of macro phages to target cells was approximately 10 1 at the beginning of each experiment. The percentage of growth inhibition of P815 cells due to compositionmediated macrophage activation was calculated by comparison to that of P815 cells grown in the presence of macrophages from buffer treated animals.The results are provided in Table IV following Table IV In Vivo Macrophage Activation Using dsRNA Tobramycin Complex Percent Amount of Amount of MacrophageCompound Compound a Human Serum Cytotoxicity Expt. 1 Expt. 2 dsRNA 10 pg. 91 70 dsRNA 10 pg. 0.002 ml. 78 58 dsRNA 10 pg. 0.42 ml. 30 6 dsRNA tobramycin 10 g. 100 pg. 89 81 dsRNA tobramycin 10 pg. 100 pg. 0.42 ml. 74 69Tobramycin 100 pg. l 0None 0 0 a A total of 0.5 ml. of incubation mixture was given i.p. 5 days prior to harvest of peritoneal macro phages.
