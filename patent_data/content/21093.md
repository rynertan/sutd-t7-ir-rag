# Apparatus for transmitting source radiation to a surface and for receiving radiation from the surface.

## Abstract
Apparatus for transmitting source radiation to a surface and for receiving radiation from the surface including a lucite head 1 with an ellipsoidally shaped wall 3 that is covered with reflective paint. An input source of light 9 is positioned at a first focal line 5 of the ellipsoidal head and the emitted radiation is internally reflected to form an intense slit image at the second focal line 7 of the head. A circularly shaped cylindrical exit portion 17 having its axis at the second focal line 7 is cut at the emitting end of the ellipsoidal head. A flat surface 19 positioned adjacent to the circularly shaped cylindrical portion 17 and in the plane of the second focal line 7 abuts an irradiated surface and thereby defines an alignment position for the ellipsoidal head. Optical fibers 23 are affixed adjacent the cylindrical cutout portion to receive the light that is reflected from the irradiated surface and to carry the light to a photodetector 25 .
