# Keybord switch.

## Abstract
A keyboard switch 10 comprises an insulating subs trate 30 , a first electrode 32 laid on the insulating substrate 30 , a second electrode 36 formed of a conical coil spring and facing the first electrode 32 , a dielectric 34 disposed between the first and second electrodes 32, 36 , and a plunger 18 for linearly changing the facing area between the first and second electrodes 32, 36 . The capacitance between the first and second electrodes 32, 36 is changed linearly so that the first and second electrodes are capacitive coupled for switching operation when the capacitance exceeds a given value.
