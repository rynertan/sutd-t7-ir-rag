# Heating oil in wells and generating steam from well water.

## Abstract
In a method of and apparatus for oil field steam production and use, heated refractory particles 28 flow through a steam generator 12 in heat exchange relation with well water 42 to generate steam. The steam can be caused to flow into a well 54 to heat oil in the well. The refractory particles 28 can be heated by flowing through a solar receiver 14 in heat exchange relation with solar radiation.
