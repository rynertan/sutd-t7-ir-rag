# TOOL QUILL EXCHANGING MECHANISM FOR A MACHINE TOOL

## Abstract
A machine tool, such as an internal grinding machine, includes a tool quill exchanging mechanism having an indexable tool quill storage magazine for positioning a replacement tool quill at a pick up position, a worn or used tool quill discharge mechanism having a tool quill pick off cam plate and discharge chute in spaced juxtaposition to the tool quill pick up position. A pivotal tool quill exchange arm includes first and second tool quill stations for releasably retaining a worn or used tool quill and replacement tool quill, respectively, and is pivotal to first and second tool quill exchange positions. At the first tool quill exchange position relative to the tool quill storage magazine and discharge means, a worn or used tool quill is removed from the first tool quill station by the pick off means and falls into a discharge chute and generally concurrently the second tool quill station removes a new tool quill from the pick up position and releasably grips same. At the second tool quill exchanger position relative to the toolhead of the machine, the tool quill exchange arm and toolhead are moved relative to one another to align the vacant first tool quill station and replacement tool quill in the second tool quill station of the tool exchange arm with the spindle to remove a worn or used tool quill therefrom and insert a replacement tool quill therein.
