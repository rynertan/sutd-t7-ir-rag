# Position control apparatus for controlling positions of rotary heads with respect to a recording medium.

## Abstract
An apparatus for controlling the position of the rotary heads HA HD with respect to the recording medium 12 comprises a pulse generating circuit and piezo electric head displacing mechanisms 90A 90D . The pulse generating circuit outputs a signal with phase and pulse width corres ponding to a recording or reproducing period in which one of the rotary heads records or reproduces a signal. To reduce wear, the head displacing mechanism provided with each rotary head separates the non active heads from the record ing medium. Means are also described to compensate for changes in the response of the piezo electric plates due to age and temperature variations.
