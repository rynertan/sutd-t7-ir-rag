# ROTATING ARC WELDING METHOD.

## Abstract
A welding method for rotating a nozzle 3 within a groove 2 by deflecting a welding electrode 9 from the central axis a , which comprises the steps of bringing the central axis a of the nozzle to the center of the groove 2 by smoothing the varying value of welding current or voltage at every half clockwise or counterclockwise rotation of the nozzle and controlling so as to move the nozzle horizontally at a right angle of the welding direction, and maintaining the height with respect to the groove 2 at a prescribed distance by smoothing the varying value of the welding current or voltage and controlling so as to move the nozzle 3 vertically so that the difference between the value and the set value becomes zero.
