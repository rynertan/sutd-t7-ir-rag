# Overvoltage analyzer.

## Abstract
The overvoltage analyzer is an electronic instrument designed to measure and record the overvoltage charac teristics. It measures the rise times, the duration times and the amplitude values and combines them in order to form a number of different classes of overvoltages. The obtained data are stored in a memory unit ME and displayed at will of the operator.
