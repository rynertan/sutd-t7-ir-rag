# Light assembly.

## Abstract
To retain a lamp 21 in a reflector body 20 of a light assembly, a wire retaining clip is provided which has a U shaped anchor portion 10 disposed as a friction fit in a recess 27 in the body 20 . Arms 14 of the clip extend in cantilever fashion from the anchor portion 10 and engage against a flange on the lamp 21 so as to urge an abutment surface on the lamp 21 into engagement with a correspond ing abutment surface in the reflector body 20 . The arms 14 of the clip are resiliently biassed in the same direction as that required to bring said abutment surfaces into mutual engagement and are also resiliently deformable outwardly so as to facilitate snap engagement of the lamp 21 into a lamp receiving aperture in the reflector body 20 .
