# Gauging apparatus.

## Abstract
Apparatus for gauging physical dimensions of solid or tubular bodies. Apparatus comprises a capacitive transduc er 10, 12, 14 having electrodes 12 forming diametrically arranged pairs of capacitors and means for connecting the pairs, preferably sequentially, in an arm of a four arm electrical network. For circumferential scanning of a solid body 1 along its length, the body is moved along a path of travel through a head assembly 30 including the transduc er with the axis of the body being coincident with the axis of the transducer. As the body moves through the transducer the diametrically arranged pairs of capacitors scan the sur face to result in a surface profile of the body. For scanning the bore of a pipe or tube the transducer 60 is inserted as a probe and moved along the bore of the pipe or tube, means being provided for maintaining the probe coaxial with the pipe or tube.
