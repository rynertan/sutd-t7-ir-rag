# Router tool and insert for same.

## Abstract
A router tool and a cutting insert for transverse cutting of a work piece, preferably of fiber reinforced plastics. The router comprises a shank 14 and a cylindrical router body 10 having chip gullets 11 and sites 12 that have received cutting inserts 13 . Each insert 13 has a cutting edge 20 which has a number of teeth 21 extending in the rotational direction of the router. The inserts 13 are staggered in the axial direction such that the router varying will present a right handed cutting portion 22 and a left handed cutting portion 23 whereby the work piece may be machined without producing defective burrs and fluffy fibers.
