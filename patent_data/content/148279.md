## Description
This invention relates to a numerical control method of creating a curved surface to be machined of a three dimensional curved body and, more particularly but not exclusively, to a curved surface creation method that is ideal for the creation of an NC tape required for the numerically controlled machining of a three dimensional metal mold or the like. A curved surface of a three dimensional metal mold or the like on a design drawing is generally expressed by a plurality of section curves, but no profile data is shown for the shape of the area lying between a certain section curve and the next adjacent section curve. In numerically controlled machining it is essential that machining be carried out so as to smoothly connect these two section curves despite the fact that the profile between them is not given. In other words, this means that machining must be performed by generating the curved surface between the two section curves from such data as that indicative of the section curves, recording on an NC tape the data concerning the generated curved surface, and carrying out machining in accordance with commands from the NC tape. To this end, the applicant has proposed in U.S. Serial No. 266,284 see Japanese Patent Application No. 55 78247 a method of creating curved surfaces, comprising generating a plurality of intermediate sections and finding a section curve intermediate section curve on a curved body, based on the intermediate sections, in accordance with predetermined rules, from section data specifying given sections of a three dimensional curved body and from data specifying section curves in said sections, and generating the curved surface of the three dimensional body based on the plurality of generated intermediate section curves. However, since the prior art method is adapted to generate a curved surface by giving the reference curve 21a in the reference section a plane , curved surface generation cannot be performed in a case where a reference curve is a three dimensional curve that does not lie on a plane. Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a curved surface creation method whereby a curved surface can be created even if a reference curve is a three dimensional curve that does not lie on a plane. According to the present invention there is provided a numerical control method of creating a curved surface to be machined of a three dimensional curved body, comprising the steps of entering section data relating to two sections of the three dimensional curved body, data relating to first and second section curves formed by the two sections, and data relating to a third curve which contains points P Fig. 1 is a view for describing a prior art method, Fig. 2 is a schematic view indicating the present invention, Fig. 3 is a view for describing a method of specifying a three dimensional curve, Fig. 4 is a block diagram of an apparatus for practicing the present invention, Fig. 5 is a flowchart useful in describing processing for specifying a three dimensional curve, Fig. 6 is a view useful in describing a method of specifying a curve on a plane, Fig. 7 is a view for describing section and section curve data input processing according to the present invention, Fig. 8 is a view for describing a tangent calculation principle, Fig. 9 is a view useful in describing processing for creating a curved surface according to the present invention, Fig. 10 is a flowchart of curved surface creation processing, and Fig. 11 is another example of a curved body created by the present invention. Processing for creating a curved surface according to the present invention is broadly classified into the following five processes A E According to the present invention, a three dimensional curved body can be created by giving two section curves and a three dimensional curve which connects predetermined points on each of the section curves. The present invention is therefore well suited for use in creating NC program data indicative of a three dimensional curved body having a complicated shape, or in the machining of such a three dimensional body.
