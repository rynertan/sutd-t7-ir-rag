TRANSMISSION FOR VEHICLES AND THEIR GEARING AND OF APPLICATION IN INDUSTRY IN GENERAL.

## Description
TRANSMISSIONS FOR VEHICLES AND THEIR GEARING AND OFAPPLICATION IN INDUSTRY IN GENERALIt appears necessary to define what the authors of this patent of invention application wish to express with the word TRANSMISSIONS. A vehicle s speed gear, gearbox, reduction gear, etc., are examples of transmissions. In general, the word embraces any mechanical group in which there is variation between the turning speed of one shaft that of output and the turning speed of another that of input . This speed modification may affect only the direction of turn, the module maintaining that speed, or the rate of speed itself while maintaining the same direction of turn, or both parameters. A clear example, as mentioned, is the speed gear of a vehicle.According to the will of the driver in a manually operated version, or automaticallyin an automatic version, the turning speed of the speed gear s input shaft proceeding from an engine varies with that of the output shaft responsible for corresponding drive of the drive wheels of the vehicle . Hereafter, the expression transmission ratio must be understood as the quotient between the turning speeds of the input and output shafts if this adimensional parameter is positive it will mean there is no change in direction of turn between said speeds, and if negative it is because there is a change in direction. Obviously, if its absolute value is larger than the unit this will mean a speed reduction, and a multiplication of speed if it is smaller than the unit. The speed gears presently employed in vehicles can be classified in two large groups a Constant mesh gears, characterised by having a series of toothed wheels or cogwheels, coaxial with a common shaft output shaft and of different turning speeds in relation to said shaft because of being idle mounted thereon. Each transmission ratio is attained by turn linking a certain wheel and the output shaft, achieving this with a displaceable sleeve and through appropriate mechanisms called synchronisms or synchronizers. These designs have an input shaft, one or two intermediate shafts, an output shaft and another auxiliary shaft for reverse speed. b Epicyclic gears sun or central planet, planetaries and crowns, coaxial sun and crown, with certain mechanical couplings between them such that each transmission ratio is attained by immobilizing, with the appropriate brake, one of said elements princi pally crowns and or achieving the equal rotation of two elements with action of the proper disc clutch.The above two realisations are employed in both passenger and industrial vehicles, b being the most appropriate for automatic speed gear versions.The a type realisations need very precise machining, above all because of their large and heavy synchronisers.Driving power is transmitted through a pair or at the most two pairs of meshing teeth, with which it can be argued that excessive weight of metal is used. When there is a large number of speeds, more than six, for example, apart from the mentioned inconveniences there is that of complicated handling, and also the obligatory use of inhibitors or mechanisms to prevent the incorrect shift from one speed to another which is not the consecutive speed. The use in these designs of multi disc clutch units for selecting and connecting a certain transmission ratio, which are of American manufacture, makes the speed gears in question very expensive.Embodiments of the b type, such as Wilson versions and the like, also present inconveniences such as those described for type a , although in these of type b the driving power is channeled through as many pairs of meshing gears as there are planets in their epicyclic gears. A great drawback is that the combinations between their gears are very limited, as there can be very high and even prohibitive turning speeds of some of their elements sun, planet mount, planets or crowns when one of their transmission ratios or speeds is connected.Another notable limitation is the number of conditions to be met among their number of planets and the number of teeth of these, of the sun gear and of the crown.Finally, both constant mesh speed gears and planetary or epicyclic gears require the incorporation of an additional mechanical group clutch or torque converter, respectively, thus complicating the functional realization and making it more expensive.Speed gears based on the contents of this patent of invention application will provide the following principal advantages No need of presently know clutches, either mechanical or hydraulic. No need of hydraulic torque converters, in some applications. No need of speed synchromesh mechanisms. Non use of displaceable speed connection sleeves, with incorporation of one at the most and if it is reasonably justified for safety, for example , such as a sleeve for reverse speed connection. Non use of mechanical linkage, or the simplification of that existent, for speed selection and connection. Use of lighter and therefore less expensive bearings, since those employed will not be subject to considerable radial stress such as in the case, principally, of speed gears of the constant mesh type currently used. Greater simplicity in the selection and connection of speeds. Greater reliability and functionalism. Elimination of the difficulty, or impossibility in some cases, of a speed connection. Use of these new speed gear realisations with a greater number of transmission ratios or number of speeds than available with present designs, without this implying either greater cost or problems of handling, automation or function. A saving in fuel consumption as a consequence of the preceding advantage. The driving power can always be channeled through two or more pairs of meshing teeth, and thus their cutting will require a smaller metric module than present speed gears, the tooth length also being smaller. Coaxial input and output shafts, no auxiliary shaft being necessary to obtain inversion of the turning direction reverse speed . The possibility of all meshing cogwheels having numbers of teeth which are prime with each other, with consequently better meshing. Simpler housings, with the resulting advantage of less expensive casting, forging, stamping, welding and machining as necessary. Easy automation, something very difficult to achieve with present speed gears of the constant mesh type of synchronizers. Greater simplicity in handling, maintenance and repair. The possibility of shifting from one speed to another without interrupting or voiding the engine torque.For the cases of vehicle gearing such as, principally, gearboxes, winches and reduction gear, the definition, calculations, design and manufacture of these units, making use of the contents of this patent of invention application, will permit the following advantages over the corresponding groups presently used In gearboxes The elimination of displaceable sleeves for the connection of low or high speeds, as well as of their synchronizers. The possibility of connecting low or high speeds with the vehicle in motion and without interrupting or voiding the engine torque transmission, if this is desired. The elimination or simplification of mechanical linkage for speed connection. The possibility of easy realisation of gearboxes having more than two transmission ratios, for example three. The possibility of designing these gearboxes with two or three shafts and with the desired direction of turn of the plates or couplings of their output shafts, either in the same or opposite direction of turn of the input shaft. Greater reliability and functionalism, always with assurance of proper connection of the appropriate speed low, high or intermediate, in the case of three transmission ratios .In winches Elimination of the ring spindle reduction gear or worm gear , with its notable inconvenience of low performance due to friction loss. Substantial gear reductions or high transmission ratios with cogwheels of small size compared to the wheels which, according to present criteria, would be required to attain the same transmission ratio. For example, with two cogwheels of 5 teeth each and two wheels of 53 teeth each a transmission ratio can be obtained of a value as high as 27.25, although for reasons of dynamic balance at least three wheels of 53 teeth and three wheels of 54 teeth should be employed. The cited value of 27.25 is deduced from the expression 2 1 27.25, which is understood perfectly once this specification is read. Less volume and weight. Use of lighter bearings.In reduction gears Higher transmission ratio values. Possibility of using exterior gearing, that is, with no interior teeth crown wheels , if desired.All the above, in general lines, are the most outstanding advantages available in Vehicle Transmissions and theirGearing as regarding applications in industry in general, such being understood as realisations wherein one or more transmission ratios must be used marine speed reduction gear, for example, or speed reducers or multipliers in general , the most important advantages are Less weight and volume. Reduced cost. Greater reliability and functionalism. Greater simplicity in speed selection and connection.Finally mention must be made of another advantage regardless of the application made with the contents of this patent of invention application, which is that it is always possible to resort to exterior gearing designs, that is, without the use of crown wheels interior teeth , should this be desired.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe basic and original idea of the invention consists of the use of some groups of meshing cogwheels in a form different from the present concept of design and assembly, making it possible to achieve maximum simplification, interchangeability of parts, smoother operation and low manufacture and maintenance costs, while retaining or substantially improving the characteristics or functions to be realised. On page 1 of the drawings, Figs. 1, it, 2 and 2 are diagrams of groups of the said cogwheels corresponding to the possible modules or variations of function and which, appropriately coupled as is later described in the examples, become mechanical groups such as speed gears, gearboxes, etc. having the alreadydescribed substantial advantages over present corresponding realisations used today for the same functions.With respect to these figures on page 1 of the drawings, the indicated references represent A, B, C brakes, preferably hydraulic and multi disc. F, AS NA, Nub, NC, nA, nB nC number of teeth of the respective cogwheels. E and S respectively, input and output flanges or shafts. and 4je turning speeds of the input and output shafts, respectively.The sub indexes A, B, C assigned to the references of teeth numbers nA, nB, nC correspond to the respective brakes. That is, activation of brake A, for example, prevents cogwheel nA from turning, of brake B prevents cogwheel nB from turning, etc.If the cited sub indexes are designated i, that is, i A,B, C and the speed of wheel 1 namely nA, nB, nc is designated W iS the following fundamental kinematic equations result For gear modules of the type of Figs. 1 and 1 EMI8.1 For modules such as those of Figs. 2 and 2 EMI8.2 and for both cases EMI8.3 means that the different transmission ratios obtained with one or the other type of module are EMI8.4 respectively, and upon braking the turn of cogwheel ni, that is by making i upon activating brake i.As is deduced from the figures in question, and which are sufficiently explicit, all the wheels Ni which in these figures are three NA, NB and Nc, but which can be more or fewer than three as desired along with wheel F are coaxial and turn linked, and are mounted on a shaft about which they can freely turn this shaft, which can be called a plantary member mount as in known planetary gears, is turn linked and not coaxial with the input shaft, to which it is parrallel. The number of planetary member mount shafts, which advisably be more than one for reasons of balance, can be that desired and recommended by proper calculation, and is not conditioned by the number of teeth F, Fs, ni and Ni, the only limitation being physical impossibility due to superimposition of bodies.Wheel F5 is coaxial and turn linked with the output shaft and meshes with wheel F. Wheels n. mesh with those of N. nA with NA, nB with NB, etc. . All the wheels ni are coaxial with the output shaft and are mounted thereon with freedom of turn, adequate bushings or bearings being used for this purpose. Each wheel ni is turn linked with one or more discs by means of appropriate members, so that they can be immobilised through the corresponding brake s acting upon the respective disc s . Actually each of the gear modules of these Figs. 1, 2, 2 and 1 corresponds to a respective speed gear, for which reason and to clarify possible doubts in interpretation and, above all, emphasise the excellent function, the following is an example centred on the execution ofFig. 1 with F 30, F5 29, nA 32, nA 27, nB 25,NB 34 nC 20 and NC 39, upon calculating the values of P As MB and re according to the previously cited expression III EMI9.1 and specifying equation I , the following equations are deduced EMI9.2 from which and with 0, C 0 and 0 the C following table of values is deduced EMI10.1 tb SEP L SEP t5B te SEP SEP XJ SEP Qi SEP Al SEP tb .

One transmission ratio is available for reverse speed, of a value of 4.424. To pass from 1st B 0 to C 0 brake C has to immobilise its corresponding disc or discs, and consequently wheel nC, from the initial speed of the value C 0.4338 e. For the reverse step, or from 2nd speed to 1st speed, it will be brake B which will immobilise wheel nB through the corresponding discs, from an initial speed of value B 0.3026 . The rotation speeds of the discs of brake B and C and of the corresponding cogwheels turn linked with them, n3 and nc , when the reverse speed is connected A o , have the values of 0.6119 and 1.311 e respectively. Some of the examples included in this patent application have a table of values similar to that described, for interpretation thereof permits judgment of the excellence of function corresponding to each execution.It is of interest to stress the originality and simplicity of the transmissions speed gears, gearboxes, winches etc. which can be defined and realised with these gear modules and their brakes, constituting the basic content of this patent of invention application their novelty is evident from simply a study of any present realisation, confirming that to date they have not been used doubtless because until now no one has put into practice the combination of gears and brakes described, nor consequently has discovered their considerable advantages.Adequate combination of these modules of gears and brakes permits a wide range of executions. The examples described here correspond to a range of possibilities which naturally is not limitative.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGSIn total there are twelve pages of drawings containing 28 figures. Figs. 1, 1 , 2 and 2 of the first page have already been explained. The remaining figures are the following Figs. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 correspond to diagrams of speed gears for application to vehicles. In all of them, E and S indicate the coupling flanges of their input and output shafts, respectively. The references 2 e i e 2 indicate the turning speeds of the shafts where they are situated. The remaining references correspond to cogwheels their respective number of teeth being indicated with the same reference F, Fs, F , F FF , F , nA, nB, nC...NA, NB, NC... and to brakes A, B, C, ... in Figs. 3 and 4 the reference M signifies a displaceable sleeve for forward speeds when meshing with the drive teeth of wheel N and for revese speed meshing with wheel R , which sleeve cannot turn since its exterior teeth mesh with interior teeth of the speed gear housing.As previously indicated, all these speed gears are formed by combinations of gear modules of the figures on page 1 of the drawings The Speed Gear of Figs. 3, 7, and 8 is formed by modules of Fig. 1. The Speed Gear of Figs. 4, 6 and 12 contains modules of Fig. 2 and of Fig. 1. The Speed Gear of Figs. 5, 9 and 11 is defined by modules of Fig. 1 followed by modules of Fig. 2, and finally The Speed Gear of Fig. 10 is a succession of two modules of Fig. 1 and one module of Fig. 2.Fig. 13 is a diagram of a version which can be called multiplier of number of transmission ratios or speed multiplier , the usefulness of which will be justified later with the corresponding example. Its reference are already know. It is a grouping of modules of Fig. 1 and of Fig. 2.Fig. 14 is a gearbox having three transmission ratios which are obtained by activating brakes A, B and C. S indicates an output flange for connection to a P.T.O. power take off . S1 1 and are the flanges for connection to output shafts of the engine torque, an epicyclic gear between them distributing in the appropriate proportions the output engine torques. Cogwheel 1 transmits, through an intermediate wheel without a reference in the figure and whose presence is not indispensable , the engine torque to cogwheel 2 which is turn linked and coaxial with the planetary member mount of the cited epicyclic gear.The other references are already known A, B, C brakes.F, Fs nA, nc, NA, NB, N C cogwheels. This Fig. 14 contains a module such as that already described forFig. 1. Fig. 15 shows a turn direction inverter with application of brake A there is a transmission ratio of unit value, and with application of brake R the transmission ratio acquires the value 1 inversion of the direction of turn . This Fig. 15 is formed by a module of Fig. 1 and another of Fig. 2.Fig. 16 diagrams application of a module of Fig. 1 input by the multiple planetary member mounts and output by a crown gear for the definition of a winch high transmission ratio .Figs. 17 and 17 are the diagram and illustration of execution, respectively, of a reduction gear in vehicles.It employs the simplest module derived from Fig. 1. InFig. 17, E, S, i3 and tJs are the input, output and their respective turning speeds n, N, F, and F5 are cogwheels.In Fig. 17 the new references with respect to Fig. 17 indicate 1 rear axle shaft, 2 planetary member mount shaft, 3 wheel rim, 4 brake drum, 5 end of the axle journal, and 6 wheel hub. Figs. 18 and 18 are also the diagram and illustration of execution of a vehicle reduction gear. Here use is made of the simplest module derived from Fig. 1 . The references indicate the same as for Figs. 17 and 17 , 7 being a member with exterior teeth for meshing with the crown n, and whose interior is teethed or grooved for meshing with the teeth of the end of 5. The function of 7 is to prevent crown n from turning.Fig. 19 is a speed reducer and inverter, for example for marine applications. Application of brake A gives a positive reduction, and with brake R the reduction is negative there is inversion of the direction of turn .As can be seen, it is formed by two modules of Fig. 1. Fig. 20 as in the case of the preceding figure, is another speed reducer and inverter, for example for marine applications. Brakes A and R perform the functions as described for Fig. 19. It is formed by one module ofFig. 1 and another of Fig. 1 .Fig. 21 is a speed reducer, engageable upon application of brake A. It is for application in general industry, and its transmission ratio can be very high. The references in this figure are already known. This is a group of two modules of Fig. 1 .Fig. 22 corresponds to a partial diagram of a speed gear incorporating, as first module of gears and brakes, that of Fig. 1. Illustrated in this Fig. 22 are two oil pumps for gearing identified as 2 and 2 , which are activated by the mesh between 3 and 3 with cogwheel 1, which is turn linked and coaxial with the input shaft E. 6 is the lubricating oil pan. The cited oil pumps, which can be installed in any of the described realisations, can perform the functions of making pressurised oil available for driving the multi disc brakes and for lubricating gears, bearings, etc., respectively alternatively, a single pump can be used for both functions. In Fig. 22 the references 4 and 5 identify some separating panels or members which, along with the appropriate radial seals, gaskets and leaktight joints, result in the disc brakes A, B, C corresponding to versions of dry brakes.Fig. 23 is a partial constructive sketch or design representing the multi disc brakes without references in this figure with which, when they are immobilised by the action of the ring pistons or brakes A, B, C, the different speeds or transmission ratios are connected. 1 is the output shaft of the gear module of Fig. 1 here represented, the cogwheel F5 being solid with this shaft.F, NA, NB and NC are the cogwheels cut from the same part they can also be separate members which are turn linked by means of the appropriate system, such as interior grooving for their mounting upon a bushing grooved on the exterior and in the bore of which the corresponding shaft freely turns, etc. Naturally, these wheels must be suitably placed depending upon the number of teeth and number of planetary member mount shafts. Fs, nA, nB and nc are cogwheels meshing respectively with F, NA, NB and Nc. The horizontal axis of symmetry is marked in this Fig. 23, without this implying it is necessary to install an even number of units F NA NB NC that is, an even number of multiple planets , since this can be an uneven number.Fig. 24 corresponds to the constructive adaptation of the speed gear diagrammed in Fig. 5. The references in this figure of E, S, F, Fs, F , F , nr, nA, nB, N, NA, NB, B a nb, nc, Na, Nb and Nc are already know, that is, the input and output shafts and number of teeth, respectively. 1 is the interiorly fluted hub yoked over the gearing of the end of the input shaft E, and which through plates 3 transmits the torque and the speed of flywheel 2 of the heat engine. 4 is the starting motor gear of the vehicle engine. 5 and 5 are the planetary member mounts. 6 is the intermediate shaft, the rotation speed of which is designated Ue. 7 is the output flange. 8 is the speedometer cable connection the known worm . 9, 11, 13 and 15 are the pressurised oil intakes for brakes a, b, A andB, respectively, there being two intakes 12, one for the brake oil of r and the other of c. Finally, B, A, r, c, b and a are the ring pistons for the hydraulic braking of the corresponding multiple discs. This figure has actually been realised with calculation of its components for a maximum input torque of the value 13 m.daN, for application in a passenger vehicle with six forward and one reverse speed.Its transmission ratios, number of teeth and kinematic characteristics are given in the example of Fig. 14 its length, between the support face of the heat engine block and its output flange, is 475mm, from which its notable characteristics can be judged. 16 indicates the inner gearing of the oil pump for providing pressurised oil for multi disc brakes also used, if necessary, for forced lubrication of gearing, bearing, etc. . More references have not been included to cover all the parts of this realisation, in the understanding the figure is sufficiently explicit without unnecessarily complicating it.DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENTIt is obvious that in view of the richness and great variety of possible applications and embodiments offered by the use of this invention, there is no specific preferred embodiment in any case, it is possible to cite as such those described for Figs. 1, 2, 1 and 2 , for with them or with some suitable combinations or couplings thereof it is possible to achieve speed gears of the convenient number of transmission ratios and with optimum values of the latter.

The column of number of brakes speed indicates the number of brakes applied for connection with a certain transmission ratio. It is of interest to note that it is possible to design and manufacture a speed gear, for either a passenger or industrial vehicle, such that the connection of each speed is achieved with application of a single brake, as in the case of Figs. 3 and 4, even though the number of speeds is different than five. Speed gears can also be made in which each speed requires the simultaneous application of two brakes, and so that the shift from one speed to the next, lower or higher, only requires the substitution of a single brake, that is, one brake ceases to operate while another different brake is activated this is the case of the examples of Figs. 5, 6, 8 and 7 in the adaptation to passenger vehicles .Obviously these embodiments of two brakes, as well as those of single brake, can be the most suitable for their automation. If it is desired to reduce the total number of brakes, it is possible to resort to embodiments such as those of Figs. 11 and 12 which can be called the 3x4 and 4x4 versions, respectively , and while each speed requires the simultaneous application of two brakes, there are shifts from a certain speed to the next which demand change of the two brakes, that is, their substitution by two other different brakes. In the case of Fig. 10 2x2x2 version , the connection of each speed requires the simultaneous application of three brakes, and there are certain shifts in which the three brakes must be changed for the example in question this occurs upon shifting from the 4th to the 5th speed or vice versa .SPEED GEAR FOR PASSENGER VEHICLE ACCORDING TO FIG. 3The example shown corresponds to the following number of teeth F 41, Fs 18, NA 38, nA 21, NB 36, nB 23,NC 349 nC 25, ND 32, nD 27, NG 30, nG 29 for the first module of gears.

Sleeve M immobilises wheel nN for forward speeds and wheel nR for reverse speed.The above table of kinematic values is sufficiently explicit for judging the excellent function application of brakes A, B, C, D andG, with wheel nN immobile, originates the five transmission ratios of the five forward speeds, equivalent to anulment of the speeds A, B, C, D and G, respectively. The two reverse speed transmission ratios, with wheel nR being immobilised by the opportune movement of sleeve M, are achieved upon making D 0 and G 0, that is, upon braking in D and G, respectively. The action of a brake for connecting a certain speed results in the immobilisation of a disc or discs found rotating at low speed.For example, for passing from 3rd to 4th speed, disc D is immobilised from an initial turning speed of value 0.1290 2e is, as is know, the rotation speed of the input shaft E, or the rotation speed of the heat engine of the vehicle .The absence of a clutch is justified upon considering that with Us 0 for a standing vehicle, for starting or the initiation of forward speed the sleeve M will have been located in the position in which N 0 transfer of these values to the proceding kinematic equations gives e 0, A 0.206 e, B 0.313 e, C 0.4 e, D 0.48 e and G 0.546 e, the same as saying that in initiation of the forward speed, for which the 1st speed must be connected, meaning that braking must be made with disc A to make A 0, the discs braked by A must have their rotation speed annulled from an initial value thereof of 0.206 e. If the start is in reverse speed, and in the maximum value of its transmission ratio, the disc braked by D will have to be immobilised from an initial speed of value 0.48 e, in this case sleeve M being in the position, as is obvious, in which R 0.It is thus understood, in view of the deduced speeds, that the shifting of the discs which brake A and D, respectively, replaces the function of the conventional clutch, for which proper modulation will be provided of the hydraulic pressure in the pistons of the cited brakes, for example. For other examples, comments on their tables of kinematic values are not considered necessary, since they would be similar to those already given.SPEED GEAR FOR PASSENGER VEHICLE ACCORDING TO FIG. 4This example corresponds to F 39, Fs 20, NG 32, nG 27, ND 31, nD 28, NC 28, nC 31, NB 24, nB 35, NA 19, nA 40, F 33, F s 26, NR 38, nR 21, NN 24 and nN 35.

Start in reverse speed will be made with a e first Ur o and then immobilising the discs of b from their initial turning speed of value tb 0.1376 e e speed of the input shaft, is obviously the turning speed of the vehicle s heat engine .This example of Fig. 14, which must be considered at the constructive level of preliminary design to form an idea of its utility, has six forward transmission ratios or speeds, and is of shorter length than present realisations of only four speeds, both being for the same application engine torque and maximum rotation rate of the engine .With respect to the brake pairs M. i a, b, r, A, B andC in the corresponding multiple discs, inasmuch as the vehicle s heat engine has a maximum torque of value 13 m.daN, they are of the following order MA 50 m.daN, MB 29 m.daN, Mr 36 m.daN, Na 811 m.daN, Nb 95 m.daN and MC 63 m.daN, values which can be attained easily with a ring piston hydraulic drive pressure of some 8 bars, with a friction coefficient between said discs of an approximate value of 0.09.The perfection and ease of speed selection and connection is understood simply by the fact that the connection of each is achieved merely by making pressurised oil pass to the proper volumes where the pistons b, a, r, A, B and C are located see Fig. 14 , so that each speed will be defined by the simultaneous action of two of these pistons.For this example the following table graphically expresses the sequence and respective combination of speed connections, an X indicating the piston in action and for which, obviously, U i 0, or in other words nil speed of the cogwheel ni EMI28.1 tb Pistons SEP in SEP action SEP Transmission tb Speed SEP Speed SEP SEP SEP SEP A SEP B SEP r SEP a SEP b SEP Ç SEP ratio tb SEP 1a SEP x SEP x SEP 3.5815 tb SEP 2a SEP x SEP x SEP 2.6192 tb 3a SEP x SEP x SEP 1.9849 tb SEP 4a SEP x SEP x SEP 1.4923 tb 5a SEP x SEP x SEP 1.0914 tb SEP 6a SEP x SEP x SEP 0.8270 tb Reverse SEP speed SEP x SEP x SEP 3.4923 tb Naturally, and for both manual and automatic action, it is evident that the proper hydraulic lines, along with suitable sensors, electrovalves, hydraulic controls, etc., will achieve the corresponding combinations of each speed.

Fig. 24 does not show those lines, electrovalves, etc., nor the bores for introducing oil for lubricating gears and bearings, since this is merely an explicative drawing. For the remaining examples, and so as not to unnecessarily overload this patent application with numbers, tables similar to that above are included, along with the number of teeth, making it possible to prepare tables of kinematic values if desired once the proper equations are determined according to the previously cited formulas I , II and III .If the same constructive concept of this Fig. 14 is used, retaining the number of teeth of the example just described, with the exception of wheels NB, nB, nb and nC which would have the new values NB 19, nB 34 nb 3C and nC 28, the six forward transmission ratios are obtained 1st 3.5815, 2nd 2.4435, 3rd 1.6639, 4th 1.2601, 5th 0.8597 and 6th 0.5854, with the same brakes and their corresponding combinations of simultaneous action of two of them, the reverse speed ratio being 4.7753 and whose combination of brakes is r and a, instead of r and b of the previous example with all of which, and naturally with the proper sizes of cogwheels, brake discs, pistons, bearings and shafts, a version of speed gear is obtained for industrial vehicles or vehicles with high characteristics or performance high exceedable maximum grade or declivity and high maximum speed, a conventional hydraulic torque converter being incorporated at the input of this version of speed gear.This gear would have some maximum speeds of na, ng, nA, nb and nC which would not exceed the value 0.52 , , the maximum speeds of nr and C3 r being 1.72 Ue and e e e respectively, and thus it could be applied with heat engines of medium or high turning speed.SPEED GEAR FOR PASSENGER VEHICLE ACCORDING TO FIG. 6Number of teeth F 37, Fs 22, NC 29, nC 30, B 26, nB 33, NA 22, nA 37,F 33, F 26, 5 Nr 38,nr 21, Na 27, na 32, Nb 25 and nub 34.

With regard to the multi disc brakes, their proper size and proportion is perfectly possible along with the correct number of discs for each brake, for the purpose of transmission of the convenient brake torque for immobilizing them during the time of connection of their respective speed.For this example and when considering the start of the vehicle, that is, for quantifying the action of the corresponding brake during the period of the initiation of movement at which stage the action of the conventional clutch is superfluous , it is to be noted that the value of the rotation speed of the vehicle s heat enginge e is, for example, e 1400 rpm approximate maximum torque rate of a diesel engine having a maximum turn rate of about 2000 rpm upon establishing that for s 0 this is A 0 because brake A has acted and a 0.067 e, we have a 0.067 x 1400 93.8 rpm. Consequently, the period of slippage of the discs which brake a during the start in question is that used in immobilizing them from an initial speed of a value of 93.8 rpm. In view of this result, the perfect feasibility of the system is readily understood. For the initiation of reverse speed, S 0, a 0 for the short reverse, that is of higher transmission ratio and r 0.099 e, with which brake r will perform the function of the present clutch, with braking of its discs from the initial speed of value Qr 0.099 x 1400 138.6 rpm.To this point description has been made of examples of speed gears the following, and concluding with the diagrammed figures of the drawings, explains the SPEED MULTIPLIER ACCORDING TO FIG. 13This figure is formed by a gear module of Fig. 1, without brakes and with a fixed brake that of wheel n and another module of Fig. 2.For the values F F 382 FS F S 21, N NN 28 NR 27, nR 32, NM 29, nM 30 and n nN 31 we have the equations EMI41.1 with which the following table of kinematic values is obtained EMI41.2 O 0.0618 0.1277 1.0034 1.14074 0.0658 0 0.0702 1.0034 1.00000 0.1463 0.0755 0 1.0034 0.86897With these results the previously cited definition or title speed multiplier is justified, for if this mechanical unit is installed in a certain vehicle so that it is coupled between the heat engine and the speed gear, upon connecting brake N the transmission ratio is retained in the value corresponding to the speed to which the speed gear in question is geared. If brake R acts, the transmission ratio of the speed gear will be multiplied by the factor 1.14074 that is, it will be availed of a reduced speed if on the other hand brake N acts, there will be a multiplied speed resulting from the product of 0.86897 and the transmission ratio of the connected speed of the speed gear. Definitely and if, for example, the gear has six forward speeds, incorporation of the group here described will permit 3 x 6 18 forward speeds naturally a necessary condition, to avoid their overlap, will be a step value exceeding 1.15 . It is obvious that the cited speed multiplier can have the most suitable or convenient number of transmission ratios, that is, fewer than three, three or more than three.All the examples described are formed by modules of Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, which correspond to the exterior gear versions however, combinations of modules as indicated inFigs. 1 and 2 , or the use of some of them, can result in versions of speed gears of characteristics similar to those already described.Fig. 14 This is a gearbox of three transmission ratios.EMI42.1 tb A SEP e SEP B SEP e SEP C SEP e SEP e SEP e SEP e, SEP 8 SEP e, SEP 8 tb SEP if SEP O.880 SEP if SEP e O.822 tb SEP 5 SEP 8 tb SEP 0 SEP 0.5186 SEP 0.6837 SEP 1.1560 SEP 1.000 SEP 0.950 tb SEP 1.0775 SEP 0 SEP 0.3428 SEP 1.3896 SEP 1.202 SEP 1.142 tb SEP 2 SEP .1613 SEP 0.5217 SEP O SEP 1.

The substantial advantage of the selection and connection of each transmission ratio by the braking action of some discs justifies the possibility of making these shifts without need of stopping the vehicle.Fig. 15 This reverses the direction of turn.
