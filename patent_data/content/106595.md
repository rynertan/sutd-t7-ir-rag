# Multi function machine tooling.

## Abstract
A multi function machine tool system include one or more of the following one or more dragon gate structures optionally having tool location means and or automatic tool exchanging means, two or more work surfaces, an axial displacement D.C. motor, a self generating power for self excitation and transmission, a pursuit stepper servo motor, high frequency response brake means with flexible transmis sion means, a digital precision, positioning and processing circulation control system, and a dual end driving type of working table, and driving gear assembly having low vibration ratio by means of phase difference.
