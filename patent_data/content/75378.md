## Description
PROSTHESIS DEVICE ANDMETHOD OF MANUFACTURE This invention relates to prosthesis devices and to a method of manufacturing same. Metal or alloy prosthesis devices which are implanted in the human body and have a portion thereof attached to a bone of the body are conventionally joined to the bone by reaming a cavity in the bone and cementing a portion of the prosthesis device to be attached to the bone within the cavity. An alternative practice, which is more desirable, is to join the prosthesis device to the bone by means of bone growth around the device. This requires that the portion of the device to be attached to the bone by bone growth be porous.If the portion to be joined to the bone is not sufficiently porous bone growth is inhibited and in many cases prevented to result in a failure of attachment of the device to the bone, It is known to provide the porous metal surface on the portion of the device to be attached to the bone by high temperature sintering of the metal covering said portion.The high temperatures involved in this practice however are detri enta1 to the physi.c l properties of .the metal and frequently results in the metal of the dev i ce being subject t failure as by cracking. It is accordingly an object of the present invention to provide a prosthesis device having a porous surface portion thereof adapted to be joined to a bone by bone growth, and to a method for manufacturing the same, that does not require high temperature exposure of the metal to detrimentally ati ect its physical properties. The present invention provides a powder metallurgy prosthesis device for implanting in a human body and having a portion thereof for bonding to a bone, said device cowsprising a first portion of essentially fully dense alloy and a second portion including a fully dense insert with an alloy powder layer bonded thereto with said powder layer being less dense than said essentially fully dense portion. The invention also provides a powder metallurgy prosthesis device for implanting in a human body and having a portion thereof for bonding to a bone, said device comprising a first portion of essentially fully dense alloy powder and a second portion including a fully dense insert with an alloy powder layer bonded thereto with said powder layer being less dense than said essentially fully dense portion. The present invention further provides a powder metallurgy method for producing a prosthesis device for implanting in a human body and having a portion thereof for bonding to a boner said method comprising producing a mould having a mould cavity conforming substantially to the configuration of said prosthesis device, filling a first portion of said would cavity wlth alloy powder, pqsitioning in a second portion of said mould a fully dense insert,surrounding said insert with a layer of alloy powder said alloy powder in said first position being finer than said alloy powder in said second portion, heating said mould to an elevated temperature and while at elevated temperature subjecting said mould to isostatic pressure to compact said powder, with the powder of said first portion being compacted to essentially full density and the powder of said second portion being bonded to said insert and compacted to a density less than fully dense. The invention will be more particularly described with reference to the accompanying drawing the single FIGURE of zilch is a sectional view of one example of a preferred embodiment of the method of the invention. Broadly, in accordance with the present invention, the prosthesis device is manufactured by hot isostatically compacting powdered metal or alloy from which the device is to be made within a mould having a mould cavity conforming substantially to the final configuration desired in the device.The alloy of the powder should preferably be nonreactive to body fluids to prevent destruction of the device after implanting. Alloys suitable for this purpose include the metal titanium, titanium alloys, cobalt base alloys and stainless steel. The term alloy as used herein is intended to cover metals in elemental as well as alloy form, The method of the invention coiriprises filling the mould with alloy powder with the pQrtion of the mould corresponding to the portion of the prosthesis device to be out of contact with bone growth being of a powder of a density of minus 35 mesh. The portion of the mould corresponding to the portion of prosthesis device to be connected to the bone by bone growth is provided with a solid insert of metal and surrounded by metal powder of minus 35 plus 60 mesh U.S. Standard. The mould may be of conventional construction for use in hot isostatic compacting such as of a ceramic material. The mould is evacuated and sealed then heated to an elevated temperature of the order of for example 843t018710C 1550to34000F for hot isostatic compacting in the well known manner by the use of a fluid pressure vessel. The compacting temperature employed will depend upon the specific metal being used, the temperature employed and the duration of pressure application.Typically, with conventional gas pressure vessels, suitable compacting may be achieved at pressures within the range of 704 to 1056 kg cm2 10,000 to 15,000 psi . During the compacting operation the temperature and pressure is adjusted to compact the finer powder in the portion of the mould corresponding.to the portion of the prosthesis device to be out of contact with bone to full density whereas, the coarser powder surrounding the solid, fully dense insert when subjected to the same conditions will be compacted to less than full density.Preferably, the denisty will be less than about 70 of full density and specifically have a porosity of about 402. This will provide by the use of metal particles within the limits minus 35 plus 40 mesh in surface pores in the prosthesis device over the area covered by this powder having pore dieters within the mange of 100 to 400 micrometers. This pore size is particularly adapted to Pacilitating bone growth onto the device and thus achieve bonding between the prosthesis device and the bone. With respect to the FIGURE in the drawing there is shown in cross section a powder filled ceramic mould 10 having a solid, fully dense metal insert 12 positioned therein and surrounded by metal powder 14 of minus 35 plus 40 mesh,The remainder of the ceramic mould is filled with powder 16 of an identical alloy but being minus 35 mesh and thus having higher top density than the powder 14. Upon heating and compacting at suitable temperatures and pressures the powder 16 with higher top density is compacted to full density whereas the powder 14 is compacted to a density of the order of about 40 of full density to achieve the desired porous surface suitable for attachment to bone by bone growth.
