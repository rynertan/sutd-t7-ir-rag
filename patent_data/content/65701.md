# Electronic camera.

## Abstract
A high resolution, electronic camera with storage capa bility. The image at the focal plane of a lens 5 is scanned in one direction by a linear photodiode array 1 , and in the orthogonal direction by relative motion of the linear array with respect to the lens. This relative motion is translated into comparable relative motion of a recording head 19 with respect to a recording media 21 by mechanical or electronic linkage so that the pixel information is recorded for later use simultaneously with its generation. A method for encoding the gray scale information for recording is described.
