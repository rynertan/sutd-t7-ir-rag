# NEW MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES TO GLYCOCONJUGATES, PROCESSES FOR THEIR PRODUCTION, AND APPLICATIONS

## Abstract
The invention concerns new monoclonal antibodies against cell membrane glycoconjugates, e.g. neutral glyco sphingolipids produced by epithelial cells, derivatives thereof such as antibody fragments, radioactively labelled monoclonal antibodies, and conjugates of the monoclonal antibodies with cell toxins, radionuclide complexing agents, or enzymes, processes for the preparation of these anti bodies and their derivatives, hybridoma cell lines that se crete these antibodies, a process for the preparation of such hybridoma, pharmaceutical preparations containing the monoclonal antibodies or their derivatives, and the use of the monoclonal antibodies and their derivatives in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer.
