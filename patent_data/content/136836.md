# Female electrical terminal having improved contactor block structure.

## Abstract
A single sheet material 10 is punched and bent to form an improved female terminal 10 comprising a contactor block 15 including a resilient contact piece 14 , a bottom plate 12 and an upper plate 11 having an extension bent toward the bottom plate to form a protective guide tag 17 at an end opening 16 of the contactor block through which male terminal 20 is inserted into the contactor block 15 . The protective guide tag 17 corrects the insertion posture of the male terminal 8 , thereby preventing degradation of resiliency of the resilient contact piece 14 of the contactor block 15 and improving the electrical connection between the male terminal and the female terminal.
