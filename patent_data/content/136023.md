# Steerable vehicle suspension strut assembly.

## Abstract
A bearing assembly for a MacPherson strut type front suspension of a steerable vehicle includes an angular contact ball bearing 28 with stamped upper and lower races 40 and 42 . The lower race 42 seats on a bearing seat 30 of the cylindrical reservoir 16 of the strut damper 12 , and the upper race 40 is engaged with the lower surface of a lower spring seat 26 . A combined shielding and retention member 60 has an upper wall 66 engageable with the upper surface of the lower spring seat and a cylindrical inner wall 62 engageable with the lower race to retain the bearing and lower spring seat together as a sub assembly separable from the suspension. When the sub assem bly is assembled in the suspension, the upper wall of the shielding and retention member is maintained spaced from the upper surface of the lower spring seat by the biasing force of the suspension coil spring 14 , to allow free turning of the bearing.
