# DISPLAY PANELS

## Abstract
A rigid transparent panel 10 has a peelable protective layer 12 on one side and a contact adhesive 16 on the other side covered with a peelable protective sheet 18 . The protective sheet 18 is peeled back from one edge and an indicia sheet 24 attached. Then they are fed through a nip between rollers 26, 28 , peeling the protective sheet 18 back as it advances. The indicia layer is thus laminated to the panel, the indicia facing the panel and being visible therethrough.
