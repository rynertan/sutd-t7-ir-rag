It has now surprisingly been discovered that the ester intermediates themselves have potent histamine H 2 receptor blocking activity. According to the invention there is provided a pharmaceutical composition which comprises a guanidine derivative of the formula I formula I given hereafter in which R1 and R2, which may be the same or different, are hydrogen or branched or unbranched 1 lOC alkyl, 3 8C cycloalkyl or 4 14C cycloalkylalkyl, each alkyl, cycloalkyl or cycloalkylalkyl being optionally substituted by one or more halogens selected from fluorine, chlorine and bromine, provided that at least one of R1 and R2 is halogen substituted alkyl, cycloalkyl or cycloalkylalkyl and provided there is no halogen substituent on the carbon atom of the alkyl, cycloalkyl or cycloalkylalkyl which is directly attached to the nitrogen, or R2 is hydrogen and we1 is a radical of the formula II Formula II in which W is an unbranched 2 6C alkylene chain which is optionally substituted by one or two 1 4C alkyls, E is oxygen, sulphur, sulphinyl or sulphonyl or a radical of the formula Nor5 in which R5 is hydrogen or 1 6C alkyl, R4 is hydrogen or an unbranched 1 6C alkyl which is optionally substituted by one or two 1 4C alkyls, or R4 and R5 are joined to form, together with the nitrogen to which they are attached, pyrrolidine, piperidine, morpholine, piperazine or N methylpiperazine ring X is a phenyl ring or a ring of the formula III Formula III in which the dotted line is a double bond on one side of the nitrogen and Z is carbon or nitrogen such that ring X is a 5 or 6 membered heterocyclic aromatic ring which contains at least one nitrogen and may optionally contain one or two additional hetero atoms selected from oxygen, nitrogen and sulphur, ring X, where possible, carrying one or two optional substituents selected from fluorine, chlorine, bromine, 1 6C alkyl, 1 6C alkoxy, 1 6C alkylthio, trifluoromethyl, hydroxy and amino A is phenylene or 5 7C cycloalkylene, or a 1 8C alkylene chain which is optionally substituted by one or two 1 3C alkyls and into which is optionally inserted, as part of the backbone of the chain, one or two groups selected from oxygen, sulphur, NH, 1 6C Alkyl, cis and trans vinylene, ethynylene, phenylene and 5 7C cycloalkylene, provided that the shortest link between ring X and C D is of at least 3 atoms, provided that when an optional insertion is made in chain A which results in the inserted group being directly attached to C D the inserted group is other than oxygen, sulphur, NH or N alkyl, and provided that no two insertions selected from oxygen, sulphur, NH and N alkyl are directly attached one to the other D is oxygen or sulphur R3 is 1 6C alkyl, phenyl or benzyl and the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier. It is to be understood that, in the above formula I and throughout this specification, although the double bond in the guanidine residue attached to ring X has been inserted in a particular position, other tautomeric forms are possible, and this invention includes such tautomeric forms within its scope.It is also to be understood that when A is or contains cycloalkylene the groups attached to this radical may be in the cis or trans configuration. When A is or contains cycloalkylene and or when A is an alkylene chain substituted by one or two alkyls, the compound of the formula I will, in most instances, contain at least one asymmetric centre. In such cases the compound of the formula I will therefore exist in at least two enantiomeric forms, the precise number being determined by the number of asymmetric centres.The biological activity, as hereinafter defined, of these enantiomeric forms may differ, and it is therefore to be understood that this invention encompasses the racemate of the formula I, including any possible diastereoisomeric forms, and any enantiomeric form which possesses the disclosed biological activity, it being a matter of common general knowledge to one skilled in the art how to separate diastereoisomric forms and how to separate a racemate into its enantiomers and determine the biological activity of each. When ring X is of the formula III it is to be understood that A is attached to Z. A particular value for R1 and R2 when it is halogen substituted alkyl is 2,2,2 trifluoroethyl, 2,2,2 trichloroethyl, 2 chloro 2,2 difluoroethyl, 2,2 dichloro 2 fluoroethyl, 2 bromo 2,2 di fl uoroe thyl, 2,2 dibromo 2 fluoroethyl, 2 fluoroethyl, 2 chloroethyl, 2,2 difluoroethyl, 2,2 dichloroethyl, 2 chloro 2 fluoroethyl, 2 bromo 2 fluoroethyl, 2,2,3,3tetrafluoropropyl, 2,2,3,3,3 pentafluoropropyl, 1,1,1,3,3,3 hexafluoroisopropyl, 1,3 dichloro 1,1,3,3 tetrafluoroisopropyl, l chloro l,l,3,3,3 pentafluoro isopropyl, 1,3 difluoroisopropyl or 2,2,3,3,4,4,4 beptafluorobutyl.

A particular value for R1 or R2 when it is alkyl is methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl or butyl. A particular value for R1 or R2 when it is cycloalkyl is cyclopropyl or cyclobutyl. A particular value for R1 or R2 when it is cycloalkylalkyl is cyclopropylmethyl or cyclobutylmethyl. A particular value for the optional substituent on W is methyl. A particular value for R4 or R5 is hydrogen or methyl. A particular value for the radical of the formula II is 2 methoxyethyl, 2 hydroxyethyl, 5 hydroxypentyl, 2 methylthioethyl or 2 dimethylaminoethyl. A particular value for ring X is a phenyl, oxazole, thiazole, imidazole, 1,2,4 thiadiazole, 1,2,4 oxadiazole, 1,2,3 triazole, 1,2,4 triazole, pyrazole, pyrazine, pyridine, pyrimidine or 1,3,5triazine ring. A particular value for the optional substituent on ring X when it is alkyl, alkoxy or alkylthio is methyl, methoxy or methylthio. A particular value for A is phenylene, cyclopentylene, cyclohexylene, trimethylene, tetramethylene, pentamethylene, thioethylene, thiotrimethylene, thiotetramethylene, thiopentamethylene, oxyethylene, oxytrimethylene, oxytetramethylene, methylenethiomethylene, methylenethioethylene, methylenethiopropylene, methyleneoxymethylene, methyleneoxyethylene, ethyleneoxye thylene, oxy2 methylethylene, thiopropylenethiomethylene, oxyethyleneoxymethylene, iminoethylene, iminopropylene, vinylenepropylene, oxymethylenevinylene, 1,3 phenylene, 1,3 cyclopentylene, methylene 1,4phenylene, ethyleneoxymethylene 1,4 phenylene, oxy1,3 phenylenemethylene or thiomethyleneethynylenemethylene. These values for A are written reading from left to right in fprmula I such that the first named part of the radical is attached to ring X and the last named part of the radical is attached toC D. Thus, for example, when A is a methylenethioethylene the compound of the formula I contains the part structure IV Formula IV A particular value for R3 is methyl, ethyl, phenyl or benzyl. The preferred composition of the invention is one containing methyl 5 t3 2 2,2,2 trifluoro ethyllguanidino pyrazol l yl valerate and the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof. A suitable pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt of the guanidine deivative of the formula I is, for example, a salt formed with hydrochloric, hydrobromic, phosphoric, sulphuric, acetic, citric or maleic acid. The pharmaceutical composition of the invention may, for example, be in a form suitable for oral, rectal, parenteral or topical administration, for which purposes it may be formulated by means known to the art into the form of, for example, tablets, capsules, aqueous or oil solutions or suspensions, emulsions, dispersible powders, suppositories, sterile injectable aqueous or oily solutions or suspensions, gels, creams, ointments or lotions. An example of a tablet formulation is given in Example 1. It will be recognised by those skilled in the art that the method of preparation of this formulation represents only one particular method of preparing such a formulation, and for example the amount of active agent and the amount and or nature of the excipients may be varied to satisfy particular requirements. In addition to the guanidine derivative of the formula I, the pharmaceutical composition of the invention for oral, rectal or parenteral administration may also contain, or be co administered with, one or more known drugs selected from antacids, for example aluminium hydroxide magnesium hydroxide mixtures antipepsin compounds, for example pepstatin other histamine H 2 antagonists, for example cimetidine or ranitidine ulcer healing agents, for example carbenoxolone or bismuth salts antiinflammatory agents, for example ibuprofen, indomethacin, naproxen or aspirin prostaglandins, for example 16,16 dimethylprostaglandin E2 classical antihistamines histamine H l antagonists , for example mepyramine or diphenhydramine anticholinergic agents, for example atropine or propantheline bromide anxiolytic agents, for example diazepam, chlordiazepoxide or phenobarbital. The pharmaceutical composition of the invention for topical administration mayalso contain, in addition to the guanidine derivative, one or more classical anti histamines histamine H l antagonists for example mepyramine or diphenhydramine and or one or more steroidal anti inflammatory agents, for example fluocinolone or triamcinolone. A topical formulation may contain 1 10 w w of the guanidine derivative. A preferred pharmaceutical composition of the invention is one suitable for oral administration in unit dosage form, for example a tablet or capsule which contains between 5 mg. and 500 mg. of the guanidine derivative, or one suitable for intravenous, subcutaneous or intramuscular injection, for example a sterile injectable containing between 0.1 and 10 w w of the guanidine derivative. The pharmaceutical composition of the invention will normally be administered to man for the treatment of peptic ulcers and other conditions caused or exacerbated by gastric acidity in the same general manner as that employed for cimetidine, due allowance being made in terms of dose levels for the potency and duration of action of the guanidine derivative of the present invention relative to cimetidine. Thus according to a further feature of the invention there is provided a method of inhibiting gastric acid secretion in a warm blooded animal which comprises administering to the animal an effective amount of the compound of the formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof.Each patient will receive an oral dose of between 15 mg. and 1500 mg., and preferably between 20 mg. and 200 mg., of guanidine derivative or an intravenous, subcutaneous or intramuscular dose of between 0.5 mg.and 50 mg., and preferably between 2 mg. and 20 mg., of the guanidine derivative, the composition being administered 1 to 4 times per day. The rectal dose will be approximately the same as the oral dose.The composition may be administered less frequently when it contains an amount of guanidine derivative which is a multiple of the amount which is effective when given 1 4 times per day. The guanidine derivative contained in the composition of the invention may be manufactured by methods in which the actual chemical reactions involved are known in themselves. The following processes, ring R3 processes, Rl, Rê, R , A, D and ring x having the meanings stated above, unless indicated otherwise, are illustrative. a construction of the guanidine attached to ring X by reaction of the appropriate thiourea, or a 1 6C S alkyl e.g. S methyl or S benzyl derivative thereof, or a salt of such a derivative, with the appropriate amine. The guanidine in the compound of the formula I contains three nitrogens each of which carries different substituents. The appropriate amine for use in this reaction may therefore be ammonia, an amine of the formula R1R2NH or an amine of the formula V Formula V The reaction may be conducted using an excess of one of the reactants as a diluent or solvent, or an additional diluent or solvent, for example methanol or ethanol, may be added. In many cases it is advantageous to use a catalyst such as mercuric oxide, lead oxide or sodium hypochlorite.The reaction may be conducted at ambient temperature or it may be accelerated or completed by the application of heat, for example by heating to the boiling point of the diluent or solvent. b construction of the guanidine attached to ring X by reaction of the appropriate cyanamide with the appropriate amine. Since the guanidine in the compound of the formula I contains only one unsubstituted nitrogen there are two appropriate amines, namely the amine of the formula R1R2NH or of the formula V given above. c for those compounds in which the group inserted into A is oxygen, sulphur, NH or N alkyl, reaction of a compound of the fomula VI or VII Formula VI Formula VII with a compound of the formula VIII or IX respectively formula VIII formula IX in which G is oxygen, sulphur, NH or N alkyl, R6 is a displaceable radical and A1 and A2 are fragments of A, including direct bonds, and.are such that A1 G A2 falls within the definition ofA given above. R6 is, for example, halogen, for example chlorine, bromine or iodine. When R6 R6 is directly attached to ring X, R6 may, for example, be methylsulphinyl or methylsulphonyl. d for those compounds in which in formulaIII Z is nitrogen, reaction of a compound of the formula X tFormula X with a compound of the formula XI Formula XI in which R6 is a displaceable radical. R6 is, for example, halogen, for example chlorine, bromine or iodine. e for those compound in which ring X is a thiazole ring, reaction of a compound of the formulaXII Formula XII with a compound of the formula XIII Formula XIII in which Hal is chlorine or bromine and R7 is hydrogen or the optional substituent on the thiazole ring. The reaction may be conducted in a diluent or solvent such as acetone and may be accelerated or completed by the appliction of heat, for example by heating to the boiling point of the diluent or solvent. f reaction of a compound of the formula XIV Formula XIV or an activated derivative for example halide, anhydride thereof with a compound of the formulaR DH. When the compound of the formula XIII is used as such the reaction may be conducted in the presence of a catalyst such as sulphuric acid. g reaction of a compound of the formula XV with a compound of the formula R3DH in the presence of a catalyst e.g. sulphuric acid . When the process manufactures the compound of the formula I in the form of the free base and an acid addition salt is required, the compound of the formula I in the free base form is reacted with an acid which affords a pharmaceutically acceptable anion. The starting material of the formula XIV for use in process f may be obtained by separate construction of the two side chains on the appropriate ring X. Thus the left hand side chain may be constructed by reduction of a nitro group to an amino group, reaction of this amino group with an isothiocyanate of the formula R1 N C S, and finally reaction of the resulting thiourea with ammonia in the presence of mercuric oxide. The method of construction of the right hand side chain may vary depending on the nature of ring X, the nature of the atom in ringX to which A is attached carbon or nitrogen and the presence or absence of inserted atoms or groups in chain A. In this construction it may be necessary to protect the acid function as a cyano group and to hydrolyse to the acid as a final step.WhenA contains no inserted group or the inserted group is phenylene and Z is a carbon, it is preferable to construct the ring X with the right hand chain already in place. Thus when ring X is a thiazole ring a process similar to that described in process e may be used. When ring X is a 1,2,3triazole ring, it may be formed by reaction of methazonic acid with a suitable azide. When ring X is a pyrimidine, it may be formed by reaction of a suitably substituted imino ether with 2 chloroacrylonitrile. When the inserted group in A is vinylene or ethynylene, A may be introduced by formation of the double or triple bond by standard coupling methods. When the inserted group in A is cycloalkylene radical, the chain A may be constructed by a conjugate addition to the corresponding cycloalk2 enone.When the inserted group in A is oxygen, sulphur, NH or N alkyl, the right hand chain maybe built up by a method similar to that described in process c . When Z is nitrogen, the right hand chain may be formed by a method similar to that described in process d . The starting material of the formula V for use in process a may be prepared by the methods described above for the preparation of the compounds of the formula XIV in which the right hand chain is constructed first. The cyanamide, corresponding to the amine of the formula V, for use in process b may be prepared by reaction of the compound of the formula V with cyanogen bromide. The starting materials of the formulaeVI and VIII for use in process c , and of the formula X for use in process d , may be prepared by construction of the guanidine chain on a suitably substituted ring X. As noted above, the guanidine derivative contained in the composition of the invention is a histamine H 2 antagonist, inhibits the secretion of gastric acid in warm blooded animals and is therefore useful in the treatment of peptic ulcers and other conditions caused or exacerbated by gastric acidity, including stress ulcers and gastrointestinal bleeding due to trauma. The histamine H 2 antagonist activity may be demonstrated on standard tests, for example by the ability of the compound of the formula I to innhibit the histamine induced positive chronotropic response in the spontaneously beating right atrium of the guinea pig or by its ability to inhibit the histamine induced uptake of aminopyrine into the acid space of parietal cells. All the compounds exemplified in this specification were tested either on the guinea pig atrium test or on the aminopyrine test. All those tested on the guinea pig atrium test are active at or below a bath concentration of 10 pM. and the more active compounds show complete inhibition of response at this concentration. All those tested on the aminopyrine test gave a 50 inhibition of uptake of aminopyrine at or below a concentration of 3 pM. The inhibition of the secretion of gastric acid maybe demonstrated in standard tests, for example by the ability of the compound of the fomula I, when dosed intravenously, intragastically or orally, to inhibit the secretion of acidic gastric juice in, for example, rats or dogs provided with gastric fistulae or denervated fundic pouches, and whose gastric secretion is stimulated by administration of a secretagogue, for example histamine, pentagastrin, bethanechol or food. The results obtained in the atrium and aminopyrine tests are predictive of activity in the rat and dog tests. No overt toxicity or side effects were noted during the rat or dog tests. The preferred compound exemplified in this specification exhibits inhibition of acid secretion which shows little or no decline from peak inhibition for several hours. The N methylcyanoguanidine group in knownH 2 receptor antagonists is potentially changeable into the mutagenic N nitroso N methylcyanoguanidine group in the mammalian body Pool et al., Toxicology, 1979, 15, 69 .

The precipitated product was redissolved by the addition of aqueous NaOH 12.5N 40 ml. to give a solution of the sodium salt of methazonic acid. A solution of NaNO2 36.2 g. in water 300 ml. was added during approximately 30 minutes to a suspension of 3 aminobenzoic acid 68.6 g. in concentrated hydrochloric acid 126.3 ml. and water 200 ml. at 0 5 . The mixture was filtered to give a solution of 3 carboxybenzenediazonium chloride. The solution of the sodium salt of methazonic acid was treated at 100 with a cold 50 solution of 3 carboxybenzenediozonium chloride. A precipitate formed immediately and was dissolved in aqueous NaOH 33 w w 100 ml. to give a dark red solution. The dark red solution was stirred and treated at 250 with acetic anhydride 100 ml. . During this treatment, aqueous NaOH 33 w w, 200 ml. was added to keep the mixture basic. The reaction mixture was acidified with concentrated hydrochloric acid and the precipitated product was isolated by filtration to give 101.2 g. of a light brown solid. A mixture of 23.5 g. of this solid, MeOH 150 ml. and concentrated sulphuric acid 0.5 ml. was heated under reflux for 3 hours.The reaction mixture was neutralised with aqueous NaOH 1N , concentrated, and partitioned between CHIC13 and brine.. TheCHC13 phase was dried MgS04 and evaporated to give 5.9 g. of a red oil that crystallised slowly.The solid was purified by medium pressure liquid chromatography on a silica gel column using EtOAc as eluant to give 5.3 g. of a solid which was recrystallised twice from isopropanol to give 2.7 g. of methyl 3 4 nitro 1,2,3 triazol 2 yl benzoate, m.p. 104 106 .
