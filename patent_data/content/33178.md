# Method and device for measuring the parameters of a damped mass spring system, particularly of the actuating member of a control system.

## Abstract
A method of measuring the rigidity, the damping coeffi cient and the inertia of a system consisting of a damped, spring supported mass, particularly, the manually operable member of the control system of an aircraft or a flight simulator, in which method the measurement of the rigidity takes place by determining the relationship between the force exerted on the mass and the deviation of the mass from the state of equilibrium at a speed and an acceleration of substan tially zero value and storing the relationship. The method is characterized by the initial step of forming three electric sign als namely, a force signal having a value directly proportional to the force exerted on the mass, an acceleration signal having a value directly proportional to the acceleration of the mass. and a velocity signal having a value directly proportional to the speed of the mass. Thereafter, the mass is moved in a manner such that it attains an acceleration and a velocity having values differing from substantially zero and the amp litude of the acceleration signal and of the velocity signal is adjusted such that by subtracting these two signals from the force signal substantially the same relationship to the deflec tion is obtained as in measuring the rigidity. A device for carrying out the method is also provided.
