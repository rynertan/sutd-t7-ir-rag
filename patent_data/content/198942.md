# Method for manufacturing consumable welding spacer and product produced thereby.

## Abstract
A method is disclosed for preparing consumable insert rings for use in welding of conduit and the like, which utilizes a drawing operation. Particularly, a ring having a multiple gauge configuration is drawn by a process whereby the first drawing pass achieves 80 to 90 preparation of the final cross sectional configuration. The drawing operation may be conducted at speeds of about 1 per minute, and final dimensions and shape of the inserts may be achieved by as few as two drawing passes. Surface uniformity is achieved and work hardening of the insert during formation is minimal. Starting stock utilized in the present method may be of lesser diameter than that used in conventional processes.
