## Description
TITLE ANTIFUNGAL TRIAZOLE COMPOUND This invention relates to a novel antifungal triazole compound which is useful for the treatment of candidosis and human dermatophyte infections, to processes for its manufacture, to pharmaceutical, veterinary, plant antifungal and plant growth regulating compositions containing it, and to processes for controlling fungal infections of plants and processes for regulating plant growth. Our European Patent Specification Number 44605 discloses a broad class of antifungal azole compounds of the formula I wherein R1 is alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl or aralkyl any of which may be optionally substituted, and yl and Y2 are CH or N , and their acid addition salts, metal complexes, ethers and esters. United Kingdom Patent Applications Numbers 811739, 8131370 and 8206329, from which European PatentApplication Number 82302075.5 claims priority, similarly disclose a broad class of triazole compounds of the formula II wherein R is naphthyl, biphenylyl or optionally substituted phenyl, and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Although the specific exemplified compounds disclosed in our European Patent Application Number 44605 are very effective antifungals and have relatively low gross toxicity, as measured by theirLD50 in mice, it is now known that the preferred exemplified compounds therein can cause teratological effects in the foetuses of pregnant female rats at doses which are below the maternally toxic dose. It is an object of the present invention to provide a compound of the formula I or II which is not teratogenic in either the rat or the rabbit at doses which are lower than the maternally toxic dose. Thus according to the invention there is provided 2 2 fluoro 4 trifluoromethylphenyl 1,3 di l,2,4 triazol l yl 2 propanol of the general formula II, in which R is 2 fluoro 4 trifluoromethylphenyl, and the acid addition salts thereof. Suitable acid addition salts are for example, the hydrochloride, hydrobromide, nitrate, sulphate and toluene p sulphonate. The compound of the invention may be manufactured by methods generally known per se for the manufacture of chemically analogous compounds. Thus, the following processes are provided as further features of this Ã¯nve tion a the reaction of 2 2 fluoro 4 trifluoro methylphenyl 2 1,2 ,4 triazol l ylmethyl oxirane with 1,2,4 triazole in the presence of a strong base or with preformed 1,2,4 triazole sodium in an inert solvent b the reaction of a compound of the formula III or IV, wherein X is an easily displaceable leaving group, for example a halogen such as chlorine, bromine or iodine or a sulphonyl group such as tosyl or mesyl, with 1,2,4 triazole in the presence of a strong base, or with preformed 1,2,4 triazole sodium in an inert solvent.c the reaction of an epoxide of the formula V, wherein X has the meaning stated above, with 1,2,4 triazole in the presence of a strong base, or with preformed 1,2,4 triazole sodium in an inert solvent.d the reaction of 1,3 di 1,2,4 triazol l yl acetone with a 2 fluoro 4 trifluoromethylphenyl Grignard reagent or with 2 fluoro 4 trifluoromethylphenyl lithium or e the reaction of 2 fluoro 1,2,4 triazol l yl 4 trifluoromethyl acetophenone either with a triphenyl l , 2,4 triazol l ylmethyl phosphonium halide, for example the bromide or iodide, or with a di lower alkyl 1,2,4 triazol l yl phosphonate. In processes a , b and c a suitable strong base is, for example, an alkali metal hydride, hydroxide or 1 6C alkoxide, for example sodium hydride, sodium or potassium hydroxide, sodium methoxide or ethoxide or potassium tert butoxide, in an inert solvent. When preformed 1,2,4 triazole sodium is used, a suitable inert solvent is, for example, dimethylformamide or butanol. In process e , a suitable lower alkyl radical is, for example, such a radical of 1 to 6 carbon atoms, for example a methyl or ethyl radical. 2 2 Fluoro 4 trifluromethylphenyl 2 1,2,4 triazol l ylmethyl oxirane, which is used as the starting material in process a above, may be manufactured by, for example, brominating 2 fluoro 4 trifluoromethylacetophenone, reacting the 2 fluoro 4 trifluoromethylphenacyl bromide thus obtained with 1,2,4 triazole in the presence of a strong base, and then reacting the 2 fluoro 0 1,2,4 triazol l yl 4 trifluoromethylacetophenone thus obtained with dimethylsulphonium methylide or with dimethyloxosulphonium methylide to obtain the required oxirane starting material. The compound of the formula III, used as the starting material in process b above, may be manufactured by, for example, reacting 0 1,2,4 triazol l yl acetophenone with a methyl Grignard reagent to form l 2 fluoro 4 trifluoromethylphenyl 2 1,2,4 triazol 1 yl 2 propanol, which is then dehydrated, for example with toluene p sulphonic acid in toluene, and the resulting olefin, 2 fluoro CC 1, 2,4 triazol l yl 4 trifluoromethylstyrene, is treated with, say, bromine in acetic acid to produce the required starting material of the formula III, X Br. The compound of the formula IV, which may be used as a starting material in process b , may be manufactured by, for example, reacting a ketone of the formula XCH2COCH2X, wherein X has the meaning stated above, with a 2 fluoro 4 trifluoromethylphenyl Grignard reagent, or 2 fluoro 4 trifluoromethylphenyl lithium. The epoxide of the formula V, used as the starting material in process c above, may be manufactured by, for example, reacting a phenacyl compound of the formula RCOCH2X, wherein X has the meaning stated above, with trimethyloxosulphonium iodide and a strong base. Alternatively, the epoxide V may be manufactured by thermolysis of a compound of the formula IV. l,3 Di l,2,4 triazol 1 yl acetone, which is used as starting material in process d above, may be manufactured by, for example, reacting 1,3 dichloroacetone with 1,2,4 triazole. The phosphonium and phosphonate reagents used as starting materials in process e above, may be manufactured by reacting l chloromethyl 1,2,4 triazole with either triphenylphosphine, as described inEuropean Patent Publication No.60222, or with potassium diethyl phosphite. As indicated above, the compounds of the invention possess antifungal properties which make them useful in the treatment of candidosis and human dermatophyte infections. This antifungal activity against Candida albicans, a causative fungus of candidosis, andTrichophyton mentagrophytes, var. quinkeanum, a causative fungus of ringworm, was demonstrated as follows Female mice of around 30 g. weight are injected sub cutaneously on a Friday with 0.5 mg. of oestradiol benzoate. The following Monday day 0 they are clipped on the back and then dosed orally with the test compound. They are then inoculated with Candida albicans in the vagina and Trichophyton mentagrophytes var. quinkeanum on the back, and then given a second dose of the same compound. Dosing is repeated once daily on days 1 4. On day 7 skin lesions are scored visually and vaginal samples taken for culture on agar. Groups of 5 mice are used and the compound is dosed initially at a level of 250 mg. kg. The dose is then reduced sequentially until a minimum effective dose MED is found. The MED for 2 2 fluoro 4 trifluoro methylphenyl 1,3 di 1,2,4 triazol 1 yl 2 propanol in this test was 5 mg. per kg. As indicated above, the compound of this invention has been found not to be teratogenic at doses up to the maternally toxic dose. In both the rabbit and the rat, the maternally toxic dose was taken to be the lowest dose at which impaired maternal weight gain was observed. In the rabbit, this dose was 10 mg. kg.and in the rat between 25 and 50 mg. kg. In neither species was any teratological effect seen in the foetuses at these doses. Thus, according to a further feature of the invention there is provided a pharmaceutical or veterinary antifungal composition which comprises 2 2 fluoro 4 trifluoromethylphenyl 1,3 di 1,2,4triazol l yl 2 propanol together with a pharmaceutically or veterinarily acceptable diluent or carrier. The composition of the invention may be in a conventional pharmaceutical form suitable for oral administration, for example a tablet, a capsule, an emulsion or an aqueous or oily solution or suspension, or suitable for topical application, for example a cream, ointment or gel. The composition may contain conventional pharmaceutical excipients, and may be manufactured by conventional pharmaceutical techniques. Preferred pharmaceutical or veterinary compositions of the invention are compositions suitable for oral administration, and particularly tablets and capsules. In man, the daily intake of the compound for the treatment of fungal diseases, for example candidosis or human dermatophyte infections, is from 5 to 250mg., preferably 25 to 100mg., and for this purpose, tablets or capsules containing between 5 and 25mg. of the compound are an appropriate dosage form. The compound of the invention also possesses antifungal properties which are useful in combatting a wide variety of plant fungal diseases. The compound can move acropetally when applied to the plant tissue, and can also be volatile enough to be active in the vapour phase against fungi on the plant. The compound may be used as such for plant fungicidal purposes but is more conveniently formulated into compositions for such usage. The invention thus provides also a plant antifungal composition comprising 2 2 fluoro 4 trifluoromethylphenyl 1,3 di 1,2,4triazol l yl 2 propanol and a non pharmaceutical carrier or diluent. The invention also provides a method of combatting fungal diseases in a plant, which method comprising applying to the plant, to seed of the plant or to the locus of the plant or seed, an antifungally effective amount of 2 2 fluoro 4 trifluoromethyl phenyl 1,3 di 1,2,4 triazol 1 yl 2 propanol. The compound can be applied in a number of ways, for example it can be applied, formulated or unformulated, directly to the foliage of a plant, to seeds or to the medium in which plants are growing or are to be planted, or it can be sprayed on, dusted on or applied as a cream or paste formulation, or it can be applied as a vapour. Application can be to any part of the plant, bush or tree, for example to the foliage, stems, branches or roots, or to soil surrounding the roots, or to the seed before it is planted. The term plant as used herein includes seedlings, bushes and trees. Furthermore, the fungicidal method of the invention includes preventative, protectant, prophylactic and eradicant treatment. The compound is preferably used for agricultural and horticultural purposes in the form of a composition. The type of composition used in any instance will depend upon the particular purpose envisaged, and the choice of a suitable conventional composition, and the method by which such a composition may be manufactured, are apparent to those skilled in the art.
