## Description
A SEALED GALVANIC CELL CONSTRUCTION AND METHODFOR ASSEMBLING SUCH CELLTechnical Field This invention relates to a sealed galvanic cell construction comprising a container having a base, a sidewall and an open end and housing a first electrode in electrical contact with said container, a second electrode, a separator therebetween and an electrolyte therein in ionic contact with said first electrode and said second electrode a cover assembly disposed at the open end of said container and in electrical contact with said second electrode and a sealing gasket compressively disposed between said container sidewall and said cover assembly. The invention also relates to a method for assembling such cell.Background Art A continuing concern in the manufacture of galvanic cells is that electrolyte may creep through a sealed interface ot the cell ana leak out of the cell. Electrolyte leakage may shorten cell lite ana can also cause d corrosive deposit to form on the exterior surface of the cell which detracts from the cell s appearance and marketability. These corrosive salts may also damage the device in which the cell is housed. Electrolyte leakage occurs in cell systems having aqueous or nonaqueous electrolytes, organic solvent based electrolytes and liquid inorganic cathode electrolytes such as tnose based on thionyl chloride and sulfuryl chloride. Electrolytes such as alkaline electrolytes have an affinity for wetting metal surtaces ana are known to creep tnrough a sealed interface of a galvanic cell. Generally yalvanic cells comprise a negative electroae, a positive electroae, a separator therebetween and an electrolyte in ionic contact with the negative and positive electrodes, housed in a container and cover assembly and provided with sealing means, such as a gasket, disposed between the container and cover assembly.The sealing gasket provides a primary barrier to electrolyte leakage. Much effort has been devoted to the design of sealing gaskets. It is known in the prior art to provide stable long lasting sealing means by constructing a long tortuous path that electrolyte must traverse before reaching the exterior of the cell. An example of this approach is the double cell cover disclosed in US A 2,712,565 wherein the top closure of a galvanic cell comprises a pair of metal discs in contact at their centers and slightly separatea at their peripheral edges so that electrolyte must travel past the interface between the sealing gasket and the first aisc, along the top of the first disc until it contacts the bottom surface of the second disc, then along the bottom of the second disc, and past the interface between the sealing gasket and the second disc before it reaches the exterior ot the cell. The double cell cover shown inUS A 4,048,405 snows the two covers spot welded together at their centers prior to mating with otner cell components. Such prior art attempts to prevent electrolyte leakage do not consider that the manner in which electrolyte is added to tne cell may contribute to cell leakage. If the seal area of a cell, either tne surface of a sealing gasket or the surface of a container or cover against which the gasket seals, becomes wet with electrolyte when the electrolyte is being introduced into the container, the wetted surface may be corroded and the effectiveness of the seal deteriorated. This is especially so when electrolyte is added to a galvanic cell by dispensing a required volume of electrolyte into an open container already housing cell components, which are the positive and negative electrodes and separator, and with or without a sealing gasket aisposed along the inside periphery of the container sidewall.Under such circumstances the electrolyte is initially disposed above the other cell components and in contact with the upper portion of the container sidewall and the surfaces of the sealing gasket if one is present.Electrolyte that remains in the interface between the container siaewall and the sealing gasket or in the interface between the cover assembly and the sealing gasket after the cell is sealed contributes to cell leakage either Dy providing a wicking path for electrolyte creepage or by corroding the container sidewall or cover which in turn leads to electrolyte leakage. Another disadvantage inherent to prior art methods for assembling cells by dispensing electrolyte into containers having cell components therein is the time which is required for the electrolyte to soak into ano around the cell components. Electrolyte slowly displaces the air within the container and cell components therein and is aDsorbed around and by the cell components.Further assemDly of the cell is suspended to prevent electrolyte loss or spillage which could otherwise take place in subsequent sealing steps.Electrolytes typically require on the order of trom about one to about five minutes for an electrolyte volume of from about 0.3 to about 0.5 cubic centimeters to soak around ana into the cell components. So as not to completely immobilize the partially assembled cell, the electrolyte is sometimes dispensed into the container in a number of smaller volumes which permit movement of the container but do not reduce the overall time required for the electrolyte to soak into the cell components, nor can subsequent assembly steps be undertaken until all of the electrolyte has been absorbed. Thus, tne present method of dispensing electrolyte into partially assembled cells is very time consuming. Ultraminiature cells sometimes utilize a hypodermic needle as a current collector and conduit for inJecting a measured liquid electrolyte into the sealed cell, as in US A 3,945,846 and inUS A 4,091,188. These ultraminiature cells generally contain high energy density components wnich require special handling and assembling techniques. Due to their size, ultraminiature cells are not amenable to the earlier described methoas of dispensing electrolyte into an open, partially assembled cell. It would be a substantial contribution to tne art ot sealing galvanic cells to provide means for quickly dispensing electrolyte into a partially assembled cell without wetting the sealing surfaces of the cell. Therefore, it is an obJect of the present invention to provide a sealed galvanic cell wherein electrolyte is dispensed into the cell without wetting sealing surfaces. It is another object of the present invention to provide a substantially leak proof galvanic cell. Another object of the present invention is to provide a cover assembly which provides means for quickly dispensing electrolyte into a container having cell components therein and which effectively maintains the sealing surfaces of the cell free of electrolyte. It is another object of this invention to provide a method for effectively preventing electrolyte from wetting the sealing surfaces of a galvanic cell when the electrolyte is dispensed into the cell. A further ob3ect of the invention is to provide a methoa for electrolyte to be quickly absorbed around and into the cell components of a galvanic cell. The foregoing ana additional objects of this invention will become apparent from tne following description and accompanying drawings and examples.Disclosure of Invention The invention relates to a sealed galvanic cell comprising a container having a base, a sidewall and an open ena and housing a first electrode in electrical contact with the container, a secona electroae, a separator therebetween and an electrolyte therein in ionic contact with the first electrode and the second electrode a cover assembly disposea at the open end of the container and in electrical contact with the second electrode and a sealing gasket compressively disposed between the container sidewall and the cover assembly the improvement wherein said cover assembly comprises an inner cover having at least one aperture therein through which electrolyte can be dispensed into the container and an outer electrically conductive cover secured within the gasket and container. This invention also relates to a method of manufacturing a sealed galvanic cell comprising the steps of a assembling a positive electroce, a separator, and a negative electrode in a container having a base, an upright sidewall and an open end n aisposing a sealing gasket ana an inner cover having at least one aperture theretnrough at the open end of the container with the periphery of the inner cover being contiguous with the sealing gasket c evacuating air out of the cell container through the at least one aperture in the inner cover d dispensing electrolyte into the container through the at least one aperture in tne inner cover ana then readmitting air e placing an outer cover over the inner cover at the open end of the container and which outer cover is in electrical contact with one electrode of the cell and f sealing the cell by applying conventional external forces. In the preferred embodiment of the invention electrolyte is aispensed through one aperture in an inner cover into a container having a first electrode, a separator and a second electrode therein from which most of the air has been removed. An outer cover is then placed over the inner cover and the cell sealed. Generally, the first electrode in electrical contact with the container is positive and the second electrode in electrical contact with the cover assembly is negative. Prior to dispensing tne electrolyte a positive electrode, a separator ana a negative electroae are positioned in a container. A sealing gasket which typically comprises an upright vertical sidewall and a radially inwardly extending flange is inserted into the container. An inner cover having at least one aperture therethrough is disposea at the open end of the container. The periphery of the inner cover rests preferably on the flange of the sealing gasket. The at least one aperture in the inner cover provides means for evacuating air from the container. An aperture is typically circular having a radius of from about 0.03 inch 0.08 cm to about 0.06 inch 0.15 cm . Preferably, for inner covers having radii of 0.5 inch 1.27 cm and smaller there is one aperture in the center of the inner cover which aperture has a radius of about 0.045 inch 0.114 cm . The inner cover is held against the sealing gasket flange to form a temporary seal. Once this seal is formed air in the container is evacuated and electrolyte is dispensed into the container. This seal prevents electrolyte from wetting the sealing surfaces of the sealing gasket and the inner cover. Since the sealing gasket is already positioned inside the container, electrolyte is precluded from wetting the sealing surfaces between the container siaewall and the sealing gasket. A vacuum on the order of about 20 mm Hg is preferred tor removal of most of the air from within the container. Once the container has been evacuated through the aperture in the inner cover, electrolyte can be dispensed through the same aperture. The vacuum in the container assists the liquia electrolyte to soak into the partial cell assembly.Whereas dispensing electrolyte into the open end of an unevacuated container which houses cell components requires about one minute for 0.3 cc of electrolyte to be absorbed, the same volume of electrolyte is absorbed into an evacuated container having components tnerein in about two seconds. Thus the inner cover of the present invention provides means for removing air from within the container and for quickly dispensing electrolyte into a container having cell components therein while maintaining the cell sealing surfaces in a dry, electrolyte free condition. Due to the aperture in the inner cover, the inner cover is not effective as a cell closure. An outer cover therefore is placed contiguously over the inner cover and is in electrical contact with one electrode in the container. Electrical contact is required between the outer cover and one of the cell electrodes since the outer cover serves as one electrical terminal of the cell. This is generally accomplished by placing the outer cover in electrical contact with the inner cover which in turn is in electrical contact with one of the cell electrodes, generally the negative electrode. In the case of a battery whicn comprises a rolled configuration, that is a cylindrical battery in which a flexible negative electrode and a flexible positive electrode are rolled together with separator layers therebetween, contact is generally maintained between the inner cover and one of the electrodes by means of an electrically conductive strip or tab.The tab extends into that electrode and is attached to the inside surface of the inner cover in a manner so as not to obstruct the at least one aperture in the inner cover. The tab is often rollea with the electroaes so as to be properly. positioned in the rolled configuration and subsequently spot welded to the inner cover. Spot welding can be quite hazardous with prior art cover assemblies tnat utilize only one cover or two or more covers mated together if the cell system utilizes a flammable electrolyte ana the contact between the cover assembly ana a cell electroae occurs after the electrolyte is aciaeo. In keeping with the present invention the tab can be properly positioned in the cell and welded to the inner cover prior to the introduction of electrolyte and away from the presence or electrolyte vapors.This feature of the invention is particularly usetul in high energy aensity cels that employ flammable electrolytes such as a rolled cell configuration wherein the first electrode comprises manganese dioxide, the second electrode comprises lithium and the electrolyte is an organic solvent based electrolyte. Electrical contact may also be maintained directly between the outer cover and one of the cell electrodes, such as Dy extending the conductive tab from one electrode through an aperture in the inner cover ana attaching the tab to the outer cover.When the outer cover is in direct electrical contact with a cell electrode the inner cover need not be electrically conductive. In one embodiment of this invention the inner cover comprises a cell sealing cupped gasket having a vertical upright sidewall and a base having at least two apertures therethrough. An electrically conauctive tab extends from one electrode through one of the apertures in this inner cover and is attacheo to the outer cover. The container having cell components therein is evacuatea and electrolyte may be dispensed through one or more apertures in this inner cover which also functions as the sealing gasket of the cell. In this embodiment the inner cover is not electrically conductive. When the outer cover is placed in its assembly position the excess portion of the conductive tab is folded between the outer cover and the inner insulating cover. The inner cell cover prevents the folded portion of the tab trom contacting the oppositely chargea electrode and shorting the cell.The cell is sealed in a conventional fashion, compressing the sidewall portion of the inner cover between the container sidewall and the periphery of the outer cover. In a second alternate embodiment, this invention relates to a sealed galvanic cell including a container having a base, a sidewall and an open end, and housing a first electrode in electrical contact with said container, a second electrode, a separator between the electrodes and electrolyte therein in ionic contact with said first electrode and said second electrode an electrically conductive tab having a first end and a second end, said second end extending to and being in electrical contact with said second electrode and a top cover assembly comprising an inner cover having at least one aperture therein through which electrolyte can be dispensed into said container and an outer electrically conductive cover positioned over said inner cover, at least a portion of the inner surface of the outer cover being contiçuously associated with the corresponding outer surface of the inner cover characterized in that said first end of the electrically conductive tab is positioned through an aperture in the inner cover and inserted between the contigously associated Portions of said inner cover and outer cover such that said first end of the conductive tab is held in electrical contact with the outer cover by the clamping coaction of the inner cover and the outer cover. In this latter embodiment, the aperature in the inner cover is preferably located in the center of such cover, and the conductive tab is positioned such that it extends substantially vertically through said aperature. The tab is preferably composed of stainless steel. The thicknesses of the inner and outer covers may be selected so as to minimize the height of the cover assembly. This is particularly important when the overall dimensions of the cell are fixea and a maximum volume must be aevoted to the cell electrodes. The inner cover should have a thickness that is sufficient to sustain its integrity curing the evacuation of the cell, resisting outside pressure when the pressure within the cell is approximately 20 mm Hg. An inner cover having a tnickness of from about 0.001 inch 0.003 cm to about 0.005 inch 0.013 cm for a cell which has a radius or about 0.5 inch 1.25 cm and smaller will generally maintain its integrity under the above describec conaitions. Tnicker inner covers will also perform as desired.If the inner cover is selected to have a minimal thickness that is sufficient to withstand pressure differentials when the cell is evacuated but not sufficiently strong to withstana cell sealing forces, then the outer cover is selected with a thickness such tnat the cover assembly will withstand radial and normal cell sealing forces without detrimental deformation. Generally an outer cover having a thickness greater than 0.006 inch 0.015 cm is necessary to withstand cell sealing forces when the radius of the cell is 0.5 inch 1.27 cm or smaller. Generally, when the radius of the cell is 0.5 inch 1.27 cm or smaller, tnen the inner cover has a thickness of from about 0.001 inch 0.003 cm to about 0.005 inch 0.013 cm and the outer cover will preferably have a thickness of trom about 0.006 inch 0.015 cm to about 0.015 inch 0.030 cm for covers having radii of 0.5 inch 1.27 cm ana smaller. Preferably the inner cover has a thickness of about 0.005 inch 0.013 cm ana the outer cover has a thickness of about 0.010 inch 0.254 cm when the cell has a radius of 0.5 inch 1.27 cm or smaller. Alternatively, the inner cover may nave a thickness that is greater than 0.006 inch 0.015 cm and will maintain its integrity unaer cell sealing forces. In such instances an outer cover is utilized for sealing in cell electrolyte and for providing one electrical terminal of the cell, for wnich functions the outer cover may be thin. The outer cover is positionea contiguous to the inner cover after the cell electrolyte has been dispensed into the container. The cell can then be sealed in a conventional manner as by raaial sealing forces which compress the sealing gasket between tne container sidewall and the peripneries of the covers. PreferaDly sealing is completed by crimping tne uppermost portion of the container siaewall inwardly over tne covers. Electrolyte leakage along the peripneries of the covers can be inhibited as by prior art disclosures in which a space is maintained between the peripheries of the inner and outer covers by inserting a separating member therebetween so as to lengthen the distance wnich electrolyte must travel to reach tne exterior of the cell. Electrolyte leakage through and beyond the at least one aperture in the inner cover can be suostantially eliminated by disposing a sealant between tne inner and outer covers around each aperture. Preferably, the sealant is chosen so as not to be wetted by the cell electrolyte. Depending on the electrolyte, the sealant may be a fatty polyamide, a polymeric silicone, asphalt or a polymeric fluorocarbon Suitable materials for the covers or this invention are nicKei, copper, tin, steel, monel, nickel plated steel, copper clad steel, tin clad steel ana alloys and combinations tnereof and other conductive materials that will not corrode or otherwise deteriorate when in contact with the cell components.Aaditionaily, when the outer cover is in direct electrical contact with a cell electrode the inner cover need not be electrically conductive and may be a material such as a polymeric tluorocarbon, polyvinyl, polyetnylene, polypropylene, polystyrene or nylon or the like. The sealing gasket and the separating member disposed between the peripneries or the covers nave to be stable in the presence or cell electrolyte and other cell materials and can be selectea from such components as rluorocarDons sucn as polytetratluoroetnylene, tluorinated ethylene propylene polymer, ethylene copolymer with fluorinated ethylene propylene, polychlorotrifluoro ethylene, perfluoro alkoxy polymer polyvinyl polyethylene polypropylene polystyrene nylon and other materials obvious to one skilled in the art.Brief Description of Drawings The present invention will Decome more apparent from the following aescription thereof when considered together with the accompanying drawings which are set fortfl as being exemplary of emboaiments of the present invention and are not intended in any way, to be limitative thereor and wherein Figure I is a perspective view or the components of a galvanic cell in accordance with one embodiment of this invention Figure 2 is a partial sectional side elevation view taken through an assemDled cell in accordance with one embodiment of this invention wherein the inner cover has one aperture therethrough Figure 3 is a partial sectional side elevation view taken through an assembled cell in accoraance with an alternative embodiment of this invention wherein tne inner cover nas two apertures, is separated rrom the outer cover at their peripheries and has a sealant around each aperture ana Figure 4 is a partial sectional side elevation view taken through an assembled cell in accordance with an alternative embodiment or this invention wherein the inner cover comprises a sealing gasket having an upright sidewall and a base with two apertures theretnrougn. Detailed Description of Drawings slth respect to Figure 1, there is shown therein a container 2 in which there has been inserted a rolled electrode contiguration comprising a tlexible negative electrode 4, a flexible positive electrode 6, separators 8 therebetween ana an electrically conductive tab 24 in contact with the negative electrode and extending upward therefrom. The uppermost portion of the container sidewall 10 extends above step 12 in the container sidewall.Sealing gasket 14 is shown above the container ana comprises a vertical sidewall 16 whose outward facing surface is sized to be contiguous with the inner surface of the uppermost portion of container sidewall 10 and a radially inwardly extending flange 18 which can be seated upon the step 12 in the container sidewall 10. Above the sealing gasket 14 there is shown an inner cover 20 having an aperture 22 through the center thereof and the end of tab 24 welded to the bottom surface or the cover 20 in a manner so as not to obstruct the aperture 22. During assembly, the peripneral edge of the inner cover 20 is held against the flange 18 of the sealing gasket 14 forming a temporary seal. With the gasKet 14 and inner cover 20 placed over the open end of the container 2, air in the rolled cell assembly is removea by evacuating through the aperture 22 in the inner cover 20. Thereafter the requirea volume of electrolyte is dispensed through aperture 22. The vacuum in the container 2 facilitates the absorption of electrolyte into and around the cell components. An outer cover 26 is shown positioned over the inner cover 20. After electrolyte has been absorbed into and around the cell components in container 2 and air reaamittea into the container, the outer cover 26 is placed over the inner cover 20 ana the cell is sealed by radially compressing the sidewall 16 of the sealing gasket 14 between the uppermost portion or the container sidewall 10 and the peripheries of the inner and outer covers 20 and 26. In this manner a two piece cover is provided which permits rapid aispensing and absorption of electrolyte into a container having cell components therein while maintaining the sealing surfaces of the cell essentially electrolyte free so as to obtain an effectively leak proof cell. There is shown in Figure 2 a partial side elevation view of an assembled cell identified by reference number 30 in accordance with one embodiment of this invention. A container 31 is shown wherein is housed a rolled positive electrode 32, a rolled negative electrode 33 and rolled separators 34 therebetween. The cover assemDly comprises a thin inner cover 35 naving an aperture 36 In the center thereof through wnich air has been evacuated out of the container 31 and electrolyte dispensed into the container 31, and a thicker outer cover 37 which is capable of withstanding cell sealing forces without detrimentally deforming. A conductive tab 42 is secured to the negative electrode 33 ana spot welded to the inner cover 35 to provide electrical contact therewith. The inner cover is in intimate contact with the outer cover which serves as the negative terminal of the cell. A sealing gasket 38 is compressively disposed between the container siaewall 3 and the peripheries of the covers 35 and 37. Figure 3 shows an alternative embodiment of this invention. There is shown a partial cross sectional elevation. of an assembled cell identifieo by reference number 45 having a container 46 which houses a rollea positive electrode 50, a rolled negative electrode 51 ana rolled separators 52 therebetween. An inner cover 47 is shown having two apertures 48 therethrougn. An electrically conductive tab 49 extenas downward trom the inner cover 47 to the negative electrode 51 to provide electrical contact between the inner cover 47 and the negative electrode 51. During assemDly air is evacuated out or the container 46 and electrolyte inserted into the container 46 through the apertures 48. The inner cover 47 is of sufficient thickness to withstand conventional sealing forces such as radial sealing forces. An outer cover 53 is disposed over the inner cover 47 for sealing purposes and is separated from the inner cover 47 at their peripheries by a separating member 54. A sealant 55 is aisposea between the covers and encompasses the apertures 48 in inner cover 47. The separating memDer and sealant are included to inhibit electrolyte leakage. The outer cover 53 is thin and provides a seal against electrolyte leaxage. The outer cover 53 is in electrical contact with the inner cover 47 at the shoulder portion of the covers, the outer cover 53 functioning as the negative terminal of the cell. Still another embodiment of this invention is shown in Figure 4. There is shown in partial cross sectional elevation an assembles cell 55 having a rolled positive electrode 56, a rolled negative electroae 57 ana rolled separators 58 therebetween housea in a container 59. An electrically insulating inner cover 60 comprises a sidewall portion 61 which is compressively disposed between the container sidewall 65 ana the periphery of outercover 66 and a base portion 62 having two apertures 63 and 64 theretrough. An electrically conductive tab 67 secured to the negative electrode 57 extends through aperture 63 in the inner cover 60 and is attached to the inner surface of the outer cover 66. The conductive tab rolled portion 68 is disposed in the space between the inner cover 60 and the outer cover 66.Because of the electrical insulating characteristic of this inner cover 60 the folded tab portion 68 cannot snort the cell by contacting a portion of the positive electrode 56. Evacuation of the container and dispensing of electrolyte into the container is through apertures 63 and 64. A sealant 69 is shown placed over the apertures 63 and 64 to inhiDit electrolyte passaye beyond the apertures 63 and 64. Example Cells were produced in accordance with the previously cescribea invention ana as snown inFigures 1 and 2. A container having a 0.447 inch 1.135 cm outer diameter and 0.420 inch 1.067 cm high was filled with a rolled electrode configuration which comprised a lithium negative electrode layer and a manganese dioxide positive electrode layer rolled together and separatea rrom each other by polypropylene separators. A polyester seaiing gasket was inserted into the container. An inner cover having a 0.413 inch 1.049 cm outer alameter and a 0.005 inch 0.013 cm thickness and a 0.090 inch 0.229 cm diameter aperture in the center tnereof was pressed ayainst the flange of the sealing gasket. Air within the container was evacuatea in less than 1 second to about 20 mm Hg through tne aperture in the cover, after which aDout 0.3 cc of a flammable organic solvent based electrolyte was aispensed through the aperture and absorbea into and around the electroaes in about one hait second. Air was then reaamitted into the container. An outer cover having a 0.413 inch 1.049 cm outer diameter and a thickness or 0.010 inch 0.254 cm was placed over the inner cover and the assembly was sealed by raaially compressing the sealing gasket between the container sidewall ana the peripneries of the covers and by curling the top edge of the container sidewall over the cover peripheries. Control cells nousea in a similar size container and utilizing the same electrodes and electrolyte were manufactured using the prior art method of dispensing electrolyte into the open end or a partially assembled cell. As usual with prior art methods, electrolyte contaminateo the sealing surfaces or the container sidewall and the sealing gasket. Approximately two minutes were required for the electrolyte to soak into and around the rolled electrodes before the cell could be sealed. A single cover comprised the cover assembly. All the cells were stored under various temperature and humidity conditions and monitored for electrolyte leakage. The results are displayed in Table 1. As can be seen from the Table, no cells manufactured in accordance with the two cover assembly of this invention have exhibited any leakage, whereas control cells having a conventional cover and assembled in a prior art manner have leaked .
