# Method and extrusion die for coating a fibrous casing.

## Abstract
This relates to the formation of sausage casings formed of a fibrous tube by penetrating the tube or web with viscose. A specific coating and extrusion die is provided. Where there is laminar flow the penetration of the viscose is not controlled by the orifice size per se but by the relative application of the viscose with respect to a column of viscose passing through the same orifice at the same rate.
