# AUTOMATIC DEVICE FOR CLINCHING ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS TO PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARDS

## Abstract
A device for clinching electronic components mounted onto a printed circuit board to prevent them from becoming dislodged from the board before they can be soldered. A fixture plate supports a plurality of clinch blocks removably array in the pattern of in which the components are to be mounted on the board. The drilled and etched circuit board is suported above, and spaced apart from, the fixture plate and clinch blocks. An elevator raises the fixture plate until the clinch blocks are in juxtaposition below the circuit board. As each component is mounted onto the board, the leads extending through the board contact the clinch blocks and are bent thereby in opposite directions. This prevents the leads from slipping out of the holes, clinching the compo nents to the board. After all of the components are mounted onto the board, the elevator lowers the fixture plate and clinch blocks, allowing the board to be moved to the next manufacturing location.
