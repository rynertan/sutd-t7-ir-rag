# Cryostat vessel wall spacing system.

## Abstract
A plurality of rigid spacer stubs 72, 74, 76 are secured between the vessel walls 60, 62, 64, 66 of adjacent vessels. The spacer stubs 72 are mounted on the wall of an inner ves sel 60 to extend axially outwardly. A plurality of stub caps 84 are secured to the adjacent vessel wall of a next outer vessel 62 , with each stub cap having a recess designed to retain one of the spacer stubs therein. Each spacer stub engages its respective stub cap and is retained within the recess thereof when the walls of the nested vessels are at substantially the same temperature to uniformly and rigidly space apart the ves sel walls of the nested vessels. When the vessel walls thermally contract because of the introduction of low temperature liqui fied gas into the inner vessel, each of the spacer stubs is with drawn from its respective recess a distance sufficient to disen gage said spacer stub and stub cap.
