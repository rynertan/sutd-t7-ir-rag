# POLYMER COMPOSITION

## Abstract
A crosslinkable composition comprising a thermoplastic silyl modified polymer and a silanol condensation catalyst pre supported on a finely divided solid material. The silyl modified polymer contains hydrolysable silane groups introduced into the polymer by copolymerisation, grafting or transesterifica tion. The finely divided solid material has a particle diameter not greater than 20 microns and is preferably selected from porous materials which do not melt or decompose during ther moforming. The silanol condensation catalyst is preferably a dialkyl tin dicarboxylate. The use of a silanol condensation ca talyst which is pre supported reduces premature crosslinking on extrusion of the composition.
