## Abstract
The tractor unit of an articulated, freight carrying road vehicle has two rear axles, one 24 of which is driven by an engine 15 mounted rearwardly of the driven axle. The axis of the fifth wheel coupling 13 to the trailer is situated forwardly of the driven axle so that the centre of gravity of the tractor unit is in the vicinity of or is to the rear of the fifth wheel axis. The engine is connected at its rear end with a chassis 10 of the tractor unit and is supported by the rear axles so that the engine moves relative to the chassis when the rear axles move relative to the chassis.
