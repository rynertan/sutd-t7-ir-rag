# Cationic electrodeposition composition.

## Abstract
A cationic electrodeposition composition comprising the reaction product of one or more base alkyds, containing unsaturation of the fatty acid chains to provide oxidative curing and one or more ethylenically unsaturated monom ers, and one or more amine functional monomers, which are added to the base alkyd and polymerized. This composition provides a vehicle which is hydrolytically stable. Paints are prepared by the addition of conventional driers, pigments and solvents to the vehicle composition.
