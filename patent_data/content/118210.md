# PROCESS FOR SEPARATING SUSPENDED MATERIAL FROM A FLUID

## Abstract
A process for separating suspended material from a fluid comprising flowing the fluid through a porous matrix. The porous matrix is elastically deformable and restrained at its outlet end. The flow rate is sufficiently large so as to produce non uniform deformation of the porous matrix and thereby a gradient of porosity in the direction of fluid flow. At least a part of the suspended material is separated by retention within the porous matrix. The porous matrix fluid system has a self cleaning capability.
