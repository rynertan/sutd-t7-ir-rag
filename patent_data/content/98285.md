## Description
The present invention relates to ballasts or chokes used for controlling the operation of gas discharge lamps. Existing ballasts or chokes are formed as coils which prevent harmful voltage surges during lamp operation as well as serving to ignite the gas discharge lamp in a manner which is well understood. Conventional ballasts typically cause a loss of about 20 of the power supplied to drive a lamp and due to their operation at mains frequency 50 Hz the lamp life is reduced when compared with a higher frequency operation. In addition the 50 Hz operation can provide a stroboscope effect that can lead to rotating machines appearing to be stationary thereby cresting a significant safety hazard. Ballast noise can also be an annoying environmental problem. Electronic ballasts or chokes are also known. In FR A 2461427 an electronic ballast for gas discharge lamps is disclosed wherein a high voltage source and a low voltage source are derived from mains A.C. via a radio frequency suppressor, the high voltage source being used to drive an inverter and the low voltage source to drive an oscillator and driver means for controlling the inverter, the drive means comprising a push pull transistor circuit which is transformer coupled to the inverter. The electronic ballast of this disclosure does nut have a dimming facility. Electronic ballasts with dimming facilities are known from DE B 1 128 041 and EP A1 0 041 589. In DE B 1 128 041 the inverter has means for varying the frequency of an oscillator in accordance with the level of the supply voltage in order to regulate the lamp current during variations of the voltage, and so maintain the current constant. In EP A1 0 041 589 a push pull inverter and a series resonant circuit are employed for driving a plurality of lamps. The inverter of this disclosure operates at a particular resonant frequency of the series resonant circuit and a timer is provided for initially limiting the current for a fixed period of time and stepwise increasing the current for fixed periods of time until the lamps ignite. As will become apparent the present invention is distinguished from these prior disclosures. This invention provides means for operating gas discharge lamps at high frequency with a ready capability of dimming. It is known that by varying the frequency of a constant voltage source connected to the primary of a transformer, the current flowing from the secondary to the load will consequently vary. This principle is adopted in the present invention when applied to gas discharge lamps by using a controlled oscillator driving an inverter through a transformer or choke adapted to limits its own secondary current. This approach is employed for the operation of gas discharge lamps to vary their brightness by varying the frequency of their operation. The use of a transformer as aforesaid is particularly suited to operation of fluorescent lamps as distinct from High Intensity Gaseous Discharge HID lamps. With minor changes, such as the replacement of the transformer by a high frequency choke the same results can be obtained to operate HID lamps. The present invention consists in a high frequency electronic ballast for gas discharge lamps as claimed in claim 1. The present invention will now be described by way of example only with reference to the accompanying drawings. in which Fig. 1 shows a block diagram of a preferred form of ballast of the invention and comprises a high frequency controlled oscillator 1 which provides two complementary square wave outputs 16 and 17, which can be varied in frequency through changes to any of controlling inputs 10 to 15 applied to oscillator 1. A driver circuit 3 controls the operation of an inverter 4, the latter caving an output 24 which is a source to transformer 5 which directly drives lamp 6 without the necessity of additional current or voltage limiting devices. Power supply 8 produces filtered high DC voltage 21 to inverter 4 and low voltage 26 with minimum ripple content for minimal lamp flicker and reduction of FM radio frequency interference to oscillator 1 and driver 3. Mains input supply 22 being suppressed via RF suppression network 7 thus avoiding high frequency feedback into the power lines that otherwise may create T.V. and radio interference. Feedback control 27 is used to regulate the inverter current by adjusting the frequency of the controlled oscillator 1 so as to maintain a constant light output from the lamp during mains voltage fluctuation. Fig. 2 shows a detailed circuit diagram of relevant components of the block diagram of Fig. 1. The controlled oscillator 1 includes facilities for dimming provided by the input controls 10 to 15. Complementary outputs Q and Output from the inverter is directly connected to a transformer T2 and a varistor 20 to protect transistors Q4 and Q5 from inductive high voltage spikes on the primary when lamp 30 is removed or installed while the circuit is operating, or possible short circuiting of the transformer secondary or other similar factors. Current sensing resistor R10 is used to regulate the inverter current by adjusting the frequency of the controlled oscillator and to maintain a constant light output from the lamp during mains voltage fluctuation. It must, however, be understood that the controlled oscillator 1 could consist of a micro processor in which case the low voltage sensor 2 could be incorporated into the microprocessor rather than be represented as a separate entity. Ballasts in accordance with the present invention may incorporate more than one transformer to allow for multiple lamp operation from the same system. Fig 3 a shows how the ballast can be readily adapted to operate a HID lamp. The addition of capacitor C3 helps to increase the overshoot of the secondary of output transformer T2 and thereby assist striking of the lamp 30, such is the case for a low pressure sodium lamp. In Fig. 3 b the addition of an ignitor circuit 31 to the output of transformer 32 can be used for HID lamps. A starter circuit 33 initiates ignition of the lamp 30. Once the lamp 30 is ignited, the ignitor 31 is cut off from the circuitry. It should also be understood that the starter circuit can be integrated in a micro processor. Referring to Fig. 4 which is a circuit diagram of a preferred form of ballast of this invention for driving a fluorescent lamp. The mains input is suppressed against high frequency radio intererring currents, which emanate from the high frequency operation of the ballast, into the input mains lines. The R.F. suppressor 40 comprises a ring core, of a highly lossy nature, wound with two sets of wires of equal numbers of turns. The currents flowing in these wires is such that their relative fluxes oppose each other, hence no response is obtained from a 50 Hz mains current flowing into the system. Only the high frequency signals will be filtered via the L C low pass filtering action of the suppressor. Diodes D1 D4 rectify the mains input resulting in a full wave output. A small choke 41 limits surge currents flowing into the electrolytic filtering capacitor C3. Resulting output d.c. voltage V The output power stage consists of transistors Q6 Q7, capacitors C11 C12 and output transformer T2, configured as a half bridge system . A shunt metal oxide varister 42 across the transformer T2 will limit any transients or spikes due to the inductive nature of transformer T2 resulting from mistreating of the load 43, due to momentary shorting of output transformer T2 or a faulty lamp 43. The switching elements Q6 and Q7 can be power bipolar of MOS FET transistors. The mains input is reduced using C4, rectified using bridge diodes D6 D8, filtered using capacitor C5 and regulated with a voltage regulator VR. Regulated voltage VRV, with respect to GND2, will supply the control unit 44 and driver circuitry and other optional circuits included. Control unit 44 provides two complementary logical outputs Q and Complementary outputs Q, The push pull arrangement can be activated or de activated via a safe guard circuit consisting of transistors Q1, Q2 and Q3. This safe guard circuit de activates the push pull circuit, transistors Q4 Q5. The reason for using this circuit is that should the mains voltage drop below a safe value due to line voltage variation or during power up and power down conditions, thereby reducing A and B voltages on the secondary of transformer T1 below the minimum threshold voltage level of transistors Q6 and Q7. This will cause transistors Q6 and Q7 to enter their linear region of operation and short circuit the high voltage supply damage to Q6 Q7 may arise, as a result. The circuit operation can be explained as follows consider then the supply is switch Fig. 5 shows an arrangement of Fig. 1 for the control of oscillator 1 which consists of an astable multi vibrator the frequency of which depends on the external resistor R and the external capacitor C. Each of these parts can be varied by a shunt resistor fitted externally i.e. a variable resistor 40 or a mosfet transistor 44 in series with resistor 46 or optocouplers 41 and 42. A selection switch 48 used is only by way of an example, but other means are also possible. The frequency of the oscillator 1 may depend on resistance, capacitance or digital data as described in relation to Fig. 5. A photo resistor may be used for automatic dimming control with ambient light being monitored at a suitable location in the vicinity of the lamp fitting. Each lighting unit may operate with a separate light cell, or with a common cell, controlling a group of ballasts. Adjustments are possible with each unit to satisfy the level of luminance required for a particular area and can be carried out on site. The unit can be set at the factory at a specified light output. Maximum light output being related to the minimum frequency and vice versa. Independently operating ballasts, used with separate photocells provide a more uniform light distribution and the cost of an extra photo cell is a small fraction of the total cost of the unit. Dimming is applicable to the full bridge, half bridge inverters and can be provided for fluorescent and HID lamps. The oscillator 1 may be an astable integrated circuit with complementary outputs Q and The frequency variation of inverter 4 may be a direct function of resistance, therefore a variable resistor 40, or potentiometer, a photo resistor or an opto coupler, etc., may be used for effective dimming control. Alternatively, the frequency may be a direct function of capacitance 45 and the dimming being controlled by a variable capacitor such as a capacitive transducer, or a microphone, etc., again both above type functions, resistance and capacitance can be used simultaneously provided that individual function controls are established. In practice, it is easier to alter the resistor for remote control operation than be troubled by the consequences of capacitive operation subjected to long distance transmission lines. In addition when an opto coupler is used, isolation against high voltage spikes is obtained. Minimum frequency is determined by the R C time constant, relating to the maximum light output. Maximum frequency in the case of resistance control is determined by resistor R1 and the external control resistor 40, in parallel with resistor R relating to the minimum light output, as in Fig. 5. When the size of the ballast, due to the increase in the number of components arising from increase in the demand for various operations, such as current control, light control, over load detection, high voltage protection, etc., which reflect considerably in the long term reliable running of the ballast, the micro processor becomes a necessity. The overall procedure for testing various functions, such as mentioned previously, will be included in the software. The actual operation being carried out via the on board ports of the processor, either directly or via few external components. Control of the processor operation will reflect partially in the way the software is packaged, and will be critical to the speed of the processor, as to be able to provide the necessary signals to run the inverter, and simultaneously monitor all the control input and acquire parameters which determine the required status of the ballast. This is basically summarised as how should the inverter function if i load is short circuited, ii load current exceeds a safe limit, iii supply voltage falls below a critical level, or exceeds a critical level, iv mis use of the load, causing severe transients to the inverter, v zero detector at which the inverter is turned ON, vi soft start operation to minimize burden on the filaments, etc. Input control to the micro processor may be in analogue or digital form. Analogue information from a photo cell, potentiometer or a small voltage are converted to digital form via an on board A D converter for analysis. Logical data may be serial or parallel, and can be received via an on board port before diagnosis. Using serial communication between ballasts a central control system may be utilized in controlling a large number of ballasts to perform similarly or even differently according to their allocated duties. Each ballast, or group of ballasts, can be identified by a serial address, which when received will be translated to identify which ballast is required to perform the required duties. Any ballast may be required to perform at its own phase or remotely when addressed externally. Manual operation is also possible by simple use of a switch to cut the photo cell out and switch in a pentiometer. Software package This section will demonstrate one possible software approach, using a micro processor with on board RAM, a programmable timer, digital and analogue I O ports and ROM, containing the required user s software. The timer is used to interrupt the micro processor at equal intervals, during which the states of Q and Upon return from the interrupt routine the processor will resume the process of checking various input control signals, as to adjust the timer time constant for dimming, if required, or disable the inverter should it operate at a critical mains voltage, until it is interrupted again. This process becomes essential if the micro processor is a slow one. As a result, the period required to process the whole monitor may far exceed the actual frequency of operation. This means that the processor is interrupted many times during the running of the monitor, hence a small delay is required for the processor to respond to variation in the light, or other commands for which it is programmed to analyse. With reference to Figs. 6 a , b and c the output transformer T2 of Fig. 2 Fig. 6 a consists of an E core transformer. The primary winding N1 is wound separately from the secondary winding, N2 on far ends of the center leg. In this way, loose coupling Np Primary turns Where The winding ratio for the primary and the secondary determines the secondary voltage, required to break down the gases in the lamp. However, the required power into the load is determined by the number of primary turns, and the frequency at which the transformer is operating. This unique characteristic arising from the inductive nature of the transformer input is utilized in dimming, whereby, increasing the frequency of the input source will result in the reduction of the load power. However, there will be no change on the secondary voltage, other than a small decrease due to the capacitive nature of the load, which results in no significant change on the filament or tube voltage, at any dimming level, which would further provide that the tube will strike at its minimum dimmed level in the same way as its full light level with little difference in striking time. The power delivered in the filaments varies little with the change in the operating frequency, since the RMS voltage on the filaments do not change while starting. Where output transformers are not used, chokes can be employed for current limiting. For HID lamps secondary ringing helps reduce the unwanted reignition time of Mercury vapour, sodium or similar lamps during a temporary power failure. A suitable value capacitor across the lamp would maximize these ringings to a suitable level. This property can be employed for low pressure sodium lamp where it requires a voltage in excess of 600 v in order to strike the lamp which is readily achieved by the stored energy in the chokes this consideration is also applicable to E Transformers. By use of the present invention there are significant energy savings and the life of lamps will be increased. This will arise because the higher frequency of operation will increase efficiency by an estimated 10 . Consequently, the power input can be reduced for a given light intensity, thus enhancing lamp life. A side benefit of higher frequency operation is that the undesirable flicker of discharge lamps will be eliminated. This has an important safety advantage in that the 50 Hz stroboscopic effect that can lead to rotating machines appearing to be stationary will also be eliminated, as the lamp frequency is about 20 KHz well above that of mechanical devices. In addition at that frequency the electronic ballast is noise free. Lamps will be able to run at or near unit power factor. This means that the usual corrective capacitors that have to be installed to balance the inductance of the ballast can be eliminated. For a given power level the current required to operate the lamps is thereby reduced, and the sizes of wires, terminals etc. in an installation can be reduced. A further advantage of the increased efficiency of the lamps is that the heating effect on the lighted space can be reduced. As an example consider an office with ten forty watt lamps each dissipating ten watts in the ballast. The heating effect is 100 watts a significant extra load for a typical 650 watt of 1000 watt air conditioner to handle. The ballast can be used for a wide range of loads varying from lower power to high power gas filled devices. Instant starting of fluorescent tubes with a better lumen to output power ratio.
