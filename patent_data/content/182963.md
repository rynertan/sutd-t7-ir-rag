# An adder for floating point data.

## Abstract
In a digital signal processor comprising interface means for data input output with an external device data buses 21, 22 data memories 5, 6 floating point multiplier 14 for adding exponent parts and multiplying mantissa parts of a pair of data applied a floating adder subtracter 15 an accumulator 16 a switching circuit 17 and a control circuit 4 , the floating adder subtracter comprising adjusting means 67 to 69, 63 to 65 for adjusting two floating point data an adder 75 for adding the two adjusted mantissa parts of the two floating point data a leftwards shift circuit 76 for shifting output data from the adder a zero detector 79 to provide a first shift data signal a correction circuit 85 and a control circuit 89 to generate an underflow signal and provide a normalized exponent part of the sum of the two data a constant adder circuit 77 and a selector 81 for providing the shift circuit with a second shift data signal, or the first shift data signal depending on whether or not the underflow signal is generated.
