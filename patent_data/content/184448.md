# DIGITAL SCAN CONVERTERS

## Abstract
A digital scan converter includes an analog to digital converter 35 for converting red, green and blue analog primary colour signals R,G,B to red, green and blue digital primary colour signals, a memory 36 for storing the red, green and blue digital primary colour signals, a memory control circuit 42,43 for writing the red, green and blue digital primary colour signals in the memory 36 at one speed and reading out the red, green and blue digital primary colour signals from the memory at a faster speed, a digital to analog converter 37 for converting the red, green and blue digital primary colour signals read out from the memory 36 to scan converted red, green and blue analog primary colour signals 2.R,2.G,2.B , a clock signal generator for supplying clock signals to the memory control circuit 42,43 , the digital to analog converter 37 and the analog to digital converter 35 , and a synchronising signal gener ator 49 also controlled by the memory control circuit 41,42,43 for producing synchronising signals 2.f
