## Description
PLANT PHYSIOLOGICALLY ACTIVE COMPOSITION AND USE This invention relates to a method and composition for affecting plant physiology. The invention provides a method of combating weeds or regulating the growth of a plant at a locus, which method comprises applying to the locus a weed combating or plant growth regulant amount of a thiobencarb and b one or more, usually one, of trietazine, prometryne, terburyne, triallate, metoxuron, neburon, nitrofen and chlomethoxynil. In addition, the invention provides a plant physiologically active composition comprising a and b . Each of the present compounds is known separately as a herbicide, but it has been found that a and b seem to render plants more susceptible to the action of the other, so that the present method and composition are unexpectedly advantageous, especially when used in the control of weeds in ryegrass Lolium spp or cereal crops.Components a and b are synergistic, being surprisingly effective, e.g. against weeds such as mayweed Matricaria inodora , and surprisingly safe to crops, e.g. wheat Triticum vulgare or barley Hordeum vulgare . In addition, the method and composition can be used to combat a wider range of weed species than when either a or b is used alone. Thiobencarb is S 4 chlorobenzyl diethylthiocarbamate.Triallate is S 2,3,3 trichloroallyl di isopropylthiocarbamate. Prometryne is 2,4 di isopropylamino 6 methylthio 1,3,5 triazine. Terbutryne is 2 tert butylamino 4 ethylamino 6 methylthio 1,3,5 triazine. Trietazine is 2 chloro 4 diethylamino 6 ethylamino 1,3,5 triazine.Metoxuron is 3 3 chloro 4 methoxyphenyl l,1 dimethyl urea. Neburon is l butyl 3 3, 4 dichiorophenyl 1 methyl urea. Nitrofen is 2,4 dichlorophenyl 4 nitrophenyl ether. Chiomethoxynil is 2,4 dichlorophenyl 3 methoxy 4nitrophenyl ether. In a particularly preferred embodiment b is trietazine. Usually the proportions respectively of a to b are from 200 1 to 1 100, e.g. 25 1 to 1 6. Parts, proportions and percentages in this specification are by weight unless otherwise indicated. Generally there is a greater weight of a than of b . In preferred embodiments, the proportions respectively of a to triallate are from 16 1 to 1 3 to prometryne are from 8 1 to 1 3 to terbutryne are from 8 1 to 1 3 to trietazine are from 25 1 to 1 2 to metoxuron are from 16 1 to 1 4 to neburon are from 40 1 to 1 3 to nitrofen are from 8 1 to 1 5 or to chlomethoxynil are from 16 1 to 1 1. The essential components a and b can be applied together in a composition comprising a and b . The compositions can be prepared by admixing the ingredients.Usually the compositions are initially produced in the form of concentrates, e.g. containing 0.5 95 in toto of the essential components, and these are diluted with water or a hydrocarbon, usually water, for application, generally such that the concentration in toto of the essential components is 0.05 4 , though it may be up to 50 or more when sprayed from aircraft. Thus, the present compositions usually contain 0.05 95 in toto of the essential components. The compositions normally contain a surface active agent and or a carrier. The carrier may be a liquid, e.g. water e.g. water used to dilute a concentrate for application . A concentrate containing water as carrier may advantageously also contain a surface active agent. In one embodiment, a and b are ground with water, a wetting agent and a suspending agent, usually in an agitated ball mill containing grinding media, e.g. steatite balls, to a particle size for both a and b of preferably less than 5 microns, to form a flowable suspension concentrate. The carrier may be a liquid other than water, for example an organic solvent, usually a water immiscible solvent, e.g. a hydrocarbon which boils within the range 130 2700C, in which the essential components are dissolved or suspended. Thus, the invention provides a liquid composition comprising the compounds and a liquid hydrocarbon which boils within the range 130 2700C. A concentrate containing an organic solvent suitably also contains a surface active agent so that the concentrate acts as a self emulsifiable oil on admixture with water.In a particular method, an emulsifiable concentrate is produced by stirring together, preferably with warming to aid dissolution, components a and b , one or more emulsifiers and a water immiscible solvent desirably comprising xylene or isophorone to form a sdlution, and usually filtering or centrifuging to remove insoluble impurities. The carrier may be a solid, which may be finely divided. Thus, the invention provides a solid composition comprising the compound and a solid carrier. Examples of suitable solids are clays, sand, mica, chalk, attapulgite, diatomite, perlite, sepiolite, synthetic solid carriers, e.g. silicas, silicates and lignosulphonates, and solid fertilizers. Wettable powders rapidly dispersible in water may be formed by admixing a and b in particulate form with a carrier or spraying molten a and b on to the carrier, admixing a wetting agent and a dispersing agent therewith, and fluid energy milling or pulverising the whole powder mixture to a particle size sufficiently small that the wettable powder in use can form the desired suspension. The term surface active agent is used in the broad sense to include materials variously called emulsifying agents, dispersing agents and wetting agents. Such agents are well known in the art. The surface active agents used may comprise anionic surface active agents, for example mono or di esters of phosphoric acid with fatty alcohol ethoxylates or with alkylphenol ethoxylates, salts of such esters, fatty alcohol sulphates such as sodium dodecyl sulphate, sodium octadecyl sulphate or sodium cetyl sulphate, ethoxylated fatty alcohol sulphates, ethoxylated alkylphenol sulphates, lignin sulphonates, petroleum sulphonates, alkylaryl sulphonates such as alkyl benzene sulphonates or lower alkylnaphthalene sulphonates, e.g. butyl naphthalene sulphonate, salts of sulphonated naphthalene formaldehyde condensates, salts of sulphonated phenol formaldehyde condensates, or more complex sulphonates such as the amide sulphonates, e.g. the sulphonated condensation product of oleic acid and N methyl taurine or the dialkyl sulphosuccinates, e.g. the sodium sulphonate of dioctyl succinate. The surface active agents may also comprise non ionic agents, for example condensation products of fatty acid esters, fatty alcohols, fatty acid amides or fatty , alkyl or alkenyl substituted phenols with ethylene oxide, fatty esters of polyhydric alcohol ethers, e.g. sorbitan fatty acid esters, condensation products of such esters with ethylene oxide e.g. polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters, block copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, acetylenic glycols such as 2,4,7,9 tetramethyl 5 decyn 4,7 diol, or ethoxylated acetylenic glycols. The surface active agents may also comprise cationic agents, for example alkyl and or aryl substituted quaternary ammonium compounds such as cetyl trimethylammonium bromide or ethoxylated tertiary fatty amines. Preferred surface active agents include ethoxylated fatty alcohol sulphates, lignin sulphonates, alkyl aryl sulphonates, salts of sulphonated naphthalene formaldehyde condensates, salts of sulphonated phenol formaldehyde condensates, dialkyl sulphosuccinates, alkyl phenol ethoxylates, and fatty alkyl ethoxylates. Non ionic surface active agents are preferred. a and b may be admixed with a non phytotoxic oil, e.g. Actipron, Agri Oil Plus, Sun Oil llE or Fyzol llE. a and b may be employed in association with a herbicidal antidote a substance having the property of improving the safety to crops of the compounds , e.g.N,N diallyl 2,2 dichloroacetamide, 1,8 naphthalic anhydride, 4 chloro 2 hydroxyimino acetanilide, o cyanomethoximino benzeneacetonitrile or 2,2 dimethyl 3 dichloroacetyloxazolidine. Although the antidote may be applied in admixture with active compound, it is preferably applied separately, and especially as a treatment for crop seeds. The ratio by weight of herbicide to antidote is preferably from 1 4 to 4 1. a and b may be in admixture with fertilizers. a and b may be mixed immediately before useDesirably, however, they would already have been mixed. The composition is particularly useful for combating weeds in a crop. The composition can be applied after, or preferably, before, emergence of the crop. The composition can be applied before sowing the crop, with or without incorporation of the composition in the soil. Instead of applying a and b together in a composition such as is discussed above, they can be applied separately in analogous compositions containing just a or b , e.g. b such as triallate applied by pre plant incorporation and a applied pre emergence , particularly as a chemical weed control programme, or part of a chemical weed control programme, in a crop season. The invention provides a one pack presentation, in which a and b are already mixed, and also a single package adapted to hold a and b in separate containers, for use, e.g. by mixing in a spray tank. A further pesticide, e.g. herbicide, insecticide or fungicide, or another plant growth regulant can be employed in sequence or admixture with the present combination of a and b . Particular advantages are obtained with a further herbicide or plant growth regulant, particularly a further herbicide, e.g. the present combination applied before emergence of a crop and the further herbi cide after emergence of the crop. The proportions of a to further pesticide or plant growth regulant, depending on the particular further pesticide or plant growth regulant, are usually frcm 200 1 to 1 2. The further herbicide may be for example one or more of a phenoxyaliphatic acid, substituted urea, triazine, phenol, nitrile, bipyridylium compound, substituted benzoic acid, halogenated aliphatic acid, carbamate, thiocarbamate, chloroacetamide, diazine or arsenic herbicide.

In a preferred embodiment b is trietazine and neburon. It is especially preferred that b is trietazine and that it is used in combination with c linuron. The combination of thiobencarb, trietazine and linuron is synergistic. Linuron is N 3,4 dichlorophenyl Nmethoxy N methylurea. Usually the proportions of a to c are from 200 1 to 1 2, preferably 20 1 to 3 1.Generally there is a greater weight of a than of c . Preferably a thiobencarb, b trietazine and c linuron are applied together in a composition such as is discussed above for a and b . Instead of applying a thiobencarb, b trietazine and c linuron together in a composition such as is discussed above, they can be applied in separate applications in analogous compositions containing one or two of the essential herbicides, particularly as a chemical weed control programme, or part of a chemical weed control programme, in a crop season. The invention includes a one pack presentation, in which a thiobencarb, b trietazine and c linuron are already mixed, and also a single package adapted to hold either each of a , b and c in separate containers, or two of them in one container and the other in another container, for use, e.g. by mixing in a spray tank. A yet further pesticide, e.g. herbicide, insecticide or fungicide, or another plant growth regulant can be employed in sequence or admixture with the present combination of a thiobencarb, b trietazine and c linuron. The yet further pesticide can be as discussed above for the further pesticide. Particular advantages are obtained with a yet further herbicide or plant growth regulant, particularly a yet further herbicide, e.g. the present combination applied before emergence of a crop and the yet further herbicide after emergence of the crop.The proportions of a to yet further pesticide or plant growth regulant, depending on the yet further pesticide or plant growth regulant, are usually from 200 1 to 1 2. The present combination of a and b affects plant physiology so that the combination can be used as a herbicide or plant growth regulant. Plants, the soil, land or aquatic areas can be treated by the present method. The method and composition are preferably used for selectively combating weeds at a locus where a crop is growing or is to grow. The crop is preferably ryegrass, maize or a small grained crop such as a cereal crop e.g.wheat, barley, oats or rye or rice. The crop is especially wheat or barley. The present combination of a and b is active against a wide variety of weeds. It is particularly useful against blackgrass Alopecurus myosuroides wild oats Avena spp. meadow grass Poa spp. chickweed Stellaria media and mayweed Matricaria spp. In the present method, usually 0.3 26 kg, preferably 1 14 kg, in toto of a and b are applied per hectare.Usually 0.2 20 kg, preferably 1 8 kg, of a are applied per hectare. Preferably 0.5 3 kg of triallate, 1 3 kg of prometryne, 0.3 2 kg of terbutryne, 0.05 1.5 kg e.g.0.1 1 kg of trietazine, 0.5 4 kg of metoxuron, 0.2 3 kg of neburon, 1 5 kg of nitrofen, or 4 kg of chlomethoxynil, are applied per hectare. When b is trietazine, and linuron is used in combination with it, preferably 0.05 1.5, e.g. 0.1 1, kg of linuron is applied per hectare. The invention is illustrated by the following Examples.Examples 1 8 Tank mixes of a thiobencarb and b the other active ingredient shown in the table below are sprayed in the field at the rates of active ingredient shown in 200 litres of water per hectare pre emergence onto plots where wheat has been sown and onto plots where barley has been sown.
