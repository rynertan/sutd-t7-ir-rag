## Description
This invention relates generally to the field of lasers, and more particularly, is directed to a semiconductor laser device having a current confinement structure and a built in waveguide structure. With the increased use in recent years of optical disk devices, such as digital audio discs, video discs, and document files, and the spread of fiber optic communications, mass production of semiconductor lasers, which provide the light source for these applications, has become essential. In the manufacture of conventional semiconductor lasers, a liquid phase epitaxial process referred to hereafter as LPE is used for the crystal growth on the substrate. The LPE process, however, is not suitable for mass production of semiconductor lasers for the following reasons. First, the LPE process may not be used with a large size semiconductor substrate. Second, the process is not suitable for sufficiently controlling crystal growth on the substrate. Finally, the process requires a substantial amount of time to complete. For these reasons, other processes for crystal growth, such as molecular beam epitaxy referred to hereafter as MBE and metalorganic chemical vapor deposition referred to hereafter as MOCVD , have been used for mass production of semiconductor lasers. A semiconductor laser having a suitable construction for manufacture by the MOCVD process is disclosed in Applied Physics Letters, Vol. 37, No. 3, p. 262 and is illustrated in Figure 1. As shown in Figure 1, current confining layer 5 which confines the current to the direction parallel to the junction plane and controls the transverse mode of the laser, is provided on upper clad layer 4 formed on flat active layer 3. The active layer 3 is formed from a different conductive type material than neighboring p type clad layer 4 and p type coating layer 6. Thus, no current flow passes through layer 5. Active layer 3 is formed on an n GaAs substrate through an n GaAlAs clad layer 2 and p GaAlAs clad layer 4 is covered with a p GaAs contact layer. Further, the p GaAs contact layer 7 and the n GaAs substrate have a pair of metal electrodes 8 and 9, respectively. Current injection to active layer 3 is restricted to a stripe shape groove portion wherein current confining layer 5 is partially removed. Also, the thickness of clad layer 4 is so thin that wave guided light in active layer 3 is capable of spreading to current confining layer 5 and coating layer 6. Therefore, the propagation constant of the vertical mode to the junction plane just beneath the strip is different than the propagation constant of the vertical mode to the side portion of the stripe. It can be considered that the tranverse mode, which is horizontal to the junction plane, is wave guided in accordance with the distribution of the effective refractive index. The effective refractive index is given as the propagation constant of the vertical mode to the junction plane divided by the propagation constant of light in a vacuum. Thus, a wave guided mode is generated just beneath the stripe. This type of laser device produces both a current confinement effect in the horizontal direction of the junction plane by confining the current in layer 5 and a built in refraction index waveguide effect. Thus, it is reported that a low threshold, of around 50 mA, is achieved with room temperature pulse oscillation and that single mode oscillation is achievable so that the transverse mode can be controlled satisfactorily. It is very important for semiconductor lasers to have a low threshold not only to improve their life span and to reduce operating current, but also to improve the performance of the laser. Buried hetero structures BH and transverse junction stripe structures TJS are typical examples of conventional lasers having a low threshold value of 10 to 20 mA or less. In contrast, the threshold value of a laser with the construction shown in Figure 1 is 50 mA which is more than double the value for lasers with BH and TJS structures. Tests conducted by the inventors showed that with present structures, it is difficult to reduce the threshold value. The reason for the difference between the laser illustrated in Figure 1 and lasers having a BH or TJS structure is probably due to differences in the waveguide effects in the structures. With the structure of Figure 1, light guided by active layer 3 infiltrates through the clad layer 4 to current confining layer 5 and is subjected to absorption. Thus, differences in the imaginary parts of the equivalent complex refractive index are produced in the horizontal direction at the junction plane, thereby giving an absorption loss guide in which light is guided. In the case of a BH or TJS structure, the real part of the complex refractive index is affected by infiltration of light wherein light is guided through differences in the real parts, i.e., refraction indexes. Accordingly, the threshold value is probably increased by an amount corresponding to the absorption loss in the structure shown in Figure 1. Considering the above mentioned drawbacks of waveguide loss structures, it is better to make refractive index structure lasers which do not have a high absorption loss. A semiconductor laser of this type is shown in Figure 2. This device basically includes the same layers as in the device shown in Figure 1, however, clad layer 4 is thick enough not to infiltrate light to current confining layer 5 which has a high refractive index and absorbs lights. Coating layer 6, which has a higher refractive index than clad layer 4 and does not absorb light, is provided at the stripe shape groove portion. In this structure, light guided in active layer 3 infiltrates to coating layer 6, which has a higher refractive index just beneath the stripe, and to clad layer 4, which has a lower refractive index at the sides of the stripe. Thus, there are produced differences of effective refractive indexes of the traverse mode to the vertical direction of the junction plane between the inside and outside of the stripe, making a waveguide by the refractive index waveguide effect so as to confine light only beneath the stripe. It has been found, however, that lasers manufactured in accordance with Figure 2 often fail to achieve a low threshold value. The reason for this condition is believed to be the actual structure itself. It has been found that in the structure of Figure 2, there is considerable leakage of laser light into coating layer 6 at the sides of the stripe shape groove portion. This situation will be explained in more detail with reference to Figure 3. Figure 3 illustrates calculated curves indicating the relationship between effective refractive index Neff of the lowest waveguide mode in the light waveguide path and refractive index Nc of the higher refractive layer provided at one side of the light waveguide path in the typical double hetero structure laser. This mathematical model corresponds to the portion of the structure just beneath the stripe of the laser shown in Figure 2. Figure 3 indicates that the effective refractive index Neff gradually increases when the refractive index Nc of coating layer 6 is increased with a fixed thickness of clad layer 4. Note, however, that the increase in Neff is rather small compared to the increase in Nc. Thus, Neff Nc is true only when Nc is relatively small and Neff Nc at a certain larger value of Nc. If Nc is beyond this larger value, Neff is smaller than Nc. This means that the outside of the light wave guided path has a larger value in refractive index thus causing infiltration of light to the outside and therefore, no waveguide mode exists. In other words, the waveguide mode is cut off when Neff Nc. Thus, the refractive index of clad layer 4 should be at a minimum, a value which does not cause cut off , and a maximum value where Δ Neff Neff Neff Neff is the effective refractive index when there is no coating layer 6 by providing coating layer 6. Figure 3 also indicates that the increase of the effective refractive index depends on the thickness of clad layer 4. The smaller the thickness, the larger the increase in effective refractive index. In designing the ideal waveguide portion of the laser structure shown in Figure 2, the following should be considered. First, the Δ Neff should be larger than 10 ³ in order to stabilized control of the traverse mode in the horizontal direction of the junction plane. Second, thickness h of clad layer 4 should be as large as possible in order to obtain a higher manufacturing yield and to minimize damaged to the active layer when the groove portion is etched adjacent the active layer. It is clear that these ideal considerations are inconsistent. For example, if 0.3 um is selected as the thickness of clad layer 4, which is practically easy to realize, the refractive index of coating layer 6 should be very near to cut off in order to realize Δ Neff 10 ³ 10 ² in accordance with Figure 3. For a laser having the structure shown Figure 2, it is necessary to establish structural parameters near cutoff of the waveguide mode. This causes the lasing threshold value to be higher than expected due to the following problems. The first problem is that the lasing threshhold is apt to become the condition of cutoff because of variations in the thickness and refractive index in active layer 3, clad layer 4 and coating layer 6. Another problem is that the cut off condition of the waveguide mode depends upon the thickness of clad layer 4. Thus, the waveguide mode often becomes cut off where thickness h is larger even if there exists a waveguide mode where thickness h is smaller. In the structure shown in Figure 2, even if it is designed to be waveguided in the flat portion just beneath the stripe shape groove, the sides of the stripe corresponds to the portion wherein thickness h of clad layer 4 becomes substantially larger and thus it becomes a cutoff condition for the waveguide mode. This phenomenon is also made clear by the fact that radiant brightnesses appear at the sides of the stripe on top of the active layer. This fact is revealed in infrared microscope examination of this type of laser. In a laser with the structure of Figure 2, the threshold current is expected to be lower than in a laser with the structure of Figure 1 due to the change from a loss waveguide structure to a refraction index waveguide structure. However, it is not always possible to obtain a lower threshold because of the above mentioned new losses. A semiconductor laser is known from GB A 2105099 in which a groove is provided in a current confining layer 5 and the groove is filled with a first material of an intermediate refractive index. A layer of a second material of the same conductivity characteristic overlies the first material but does not enter into the groove. The characteristics of this known layer are referred to below with reference to Figure 6A. According to the invention as claimed in claim 1, whose pre amble corresponds to the laser of the above mentioned GB patent application, there is provided a semiconductor laser having a plurality of layers, comprising in succession, a first electrode, a substrate of a first conductive type, a first clad layer of the first conductive type, an active layer, a second clad layer of a second conductive type, a first current confining layer of the first conductive type, a first coating layer of the second conductive type with a refractive index larger than the refractive index of the second clad layer, a second coating layer of the second conductive type with a refractive index smaller than the refractive index of the first coating layer, and a second electrode, the current confining layer being divided into two parts by a groove into which the first coating layer extends characterised in that the second coating layer extends into and is embedded in the groove together with the first coating layer and that the thickness of the first coating layer is small compared to the thickness of the second coating layer. Since the embedded layer in the groove portion of the present invention is formed of at least two layers comprising a high refractive index layer and a low refractive index layer, light infiltrating into the groove portion is affected by the high refractive layer so that the effective refractive index distribution in the horizontal direction at the junction plane is maximum at the groove portion. Also, the effect of the existing low refractive index layer outside of the high refractive index layer prevents cutoff of the waveguide mode and has a large effective refractive index distribution even when the distance between the first coating layer and the active layer is large or where a higher refractive index is selected for the first coating layer. It is thus possible to maintain the threshold current at a minimum and to achieve satisfactory reduction of the threshold value in refractive index waveguide type lasers. Figure 4 is a cross sectional view showing the general construction of a semiconductor laser according to one embodiment of the present invention. In the drawing, 21 is an N GaAs substrate, 22 an N Ga A laser with the above construction is produced by the stages shown in Figures 5A 5C. First, as shown in Figure 5 A, N Ga In the next stage, as shown in Figure 5B, photoresist 31 is coated on current confining layer 25. Resist 31 defines a stripe shaped window 3 µm wide and serves as a mask in selective etching of current confining layer 25. An etching process in then used to form stripe shaped groove 32. After removal of resist 31 and a surface washing treatment, a second crystal growth stage is effected by the MOCVD process. A 0.03 µm thick p Ga The refractive indices of the above embodiment are 3.59 in active layer 23, 3.385 in clad layers 22, 24, 3.45 in first coating layer 26 and 3.385 in second coating layer 27. The operating characteristics of a laser formed from the above structure with a resonator length of 250 µm were found to be excellent. The threshold current was low at about 35 mA and the differential quantum efficiency was high at about 50 . Also, a current light output characteristic with good linearity was achieved with no kinks up to an output of 12 mW or more. Further, the beam waist in the horizontal and vertical directions at the junction surface where laser light was radiated from the end surface coincided with the end surface. This confirmed the presence of a good refractive index guide effect. These excellent operating characteristics are believed to be achieved for the following reason. In a slab waveguide path, if a waveguide is made in the path, the effective refractive index of the mode must be an intermediate value between the highest refractive index among all the layers forming the waveguide path and the higher refractive index of the outer most layers forming the waveguide path. If the effective refractive index is smaller than that of the outer most higher refractive index layer of the waveguide path, light is directed to the outside of the waveguide path so that no waveguide mode can exist. When refractive indices in both of the outer layers of the waveguide path are equal and the average refractive index of the inner layers is higher than the refractive index of the outer layers, the waveguide mode can exist. However, in a waveguide path having an asymmetrical distribution of refractive indices, such as shown in Figure 2, no waveguide mode can exist even though the above condition of effective refractive index is satisfied. Such a cut off of the waveguide mode easily occurs in double hetero structure lasers having a rather thin active layer and where the effective refractive index of the waveguide is close to the refractive index of the clad layer. The waveguide mode is apt to be cut off when there is a difference in refractive indices of both clad layers or when a higher refractive layer is provided close to one of the clad layers, as shown in Figure 2. This problem can be overcome by providing a lower refractive index layer second coating layer outside the high refractive index layer first coating layer . The lower refractive index layer refracts light which might be dispensed outside the higher refractive index layer when there is no lower refractive index layer. Thus, the waveguide mode can be formed. Figure 6A shows operating characteristic curves of the refractive index Neff when the refractive index Nc of high refractive index layer is changed when there is a lower refractive index layer. Figure 6B shows parameters for deriving the curves of Figure 6A. The thickness of the active layer is 0.08 µm, The refractive index of the second coating layer is equal to that of the clad layer in calculating the curves shown in Figure 6A. In this situation, cut off may not occur. It is noted, however, that this situation is not always necessary. When the refractive index of the second coating layer is different from that of the clad layer, cut off may occur at a very high value of the effective refractive index compared to the condition in which the second coating layer is not provided. Thus, the increment Δ Neff can be easily realized at 10 ³ 10 ² according to the present invention. Also, cut off does not occur at the sides of the stripe shape groove portion so that threshold current can be maintained low to achieve a lower threshold value. Figure 7 is a cross sectional view showing the general structure of a semiconductor laser according to another embodiment of the invention. Parts that are the same as in Figure 4 are identified by the same numbers and a detailed description thereof will be omitted. The difference between this embodiment and the embodiment described above is that the hetero layer is made of two layers. That is, n Ga The invention is not limited to the embodiments described above. For example, the structural material is not limited to being GaAlAs but other compound semiconductor materials may be used such as InGaAsP or AlGaInP, etc. Also, the MBE process may be used instead of the MOCVD process. Further, it is possible to use a P type material as the substrate and reverse the conduction types of the various layers.
