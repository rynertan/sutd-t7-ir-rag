# Improvements in or relating to the preparation of aqueous suspensions of talc.

## Abstract
In order to make talc more readily dispersible in an aqueous medium, it is contacted, in a finely divided form, with an aqueous solution of an alkali metal hydroxide or ammo nium hydroxide, it is then washed with clean water, whereaf ter it is thermally dried to remove at least a substantial proportion of the water associated therewith. The talc thus treated can be suspended in water containing a dispersing agent.
