# Gas turbine combustion chamber.

## Abstract
A combustion chamber 10 for a gas turbine engine having a step liner configuration and providing a double wall defining an annular confined cooling air flow passage 19 along the outer surface of the chamber. The outer wall of the double wall configuration is provided by a concentric cylindrical baffle member 20 supported in radially spaced relation from the combustion chamber wall by a plurality of leaf spring members 36 providing a basing force between the combustion chamber wall and the baffle member so that relative thermal growth between the combustion chamber wall and the baffle can be accommodated by deflection of the support springs or by axial sliding between the springs and the chamber wall. The unique feature of this invention is to provide baffles as flexibly mounted parts to form a double wall effect which eliminates all strain problems normally associated with a double wall construction with a high temperature gradient between the walls.
