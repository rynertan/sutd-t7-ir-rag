# Vibrating vane pressure gauge.

## Abstract
In a vibrating vane pressure gauge in which a plane metal vane 22 is vibrated in an enclosure 26 of only slightly larger area than the vane and the decay of the vibration which is pro portional to gas pressure is sensed, the vane is provided with at least one lip 24 along an edge of the vane.
