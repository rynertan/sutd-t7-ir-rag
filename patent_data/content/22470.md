# Gaseous discharge display devices.

## Abstract
A gaseous discharge display device gas panel requires interstitial spacer elements 31 within the display area to provide and maintain an uniform discharge gap, the spacers being positioned between parallel lines 32, 37, 43 46 which constitute the display conductors. In conventional designs using lines of constant width and linearity the lines 44, 45 immediately adjacent the spacer elements 31 experience a significant decrease in operating margin. This margin decrease is at least partially compensated for by either locally displacing the lines outwardly or by widening the lines in the affected areas or a combination of both. Various embodiments for providing this compensation are illustrated and described.
