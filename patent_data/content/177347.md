# Modified copolymer of an olefin and diene.

## Abstract
An unsaturated copolymer comprising at least one C2 12 alpha olefin e.g. ethylene, propylene, 4 methylpentene 1 and 1 50 mol of at least one 1,4 diene, of formula CHEM wherein R 1 is C1 8 alkyl and R 2 and R 3 each are hydrogen or C1 8 e.g. 1,4 hexadiene, 4 or 5 methyl 1, 4 hexadiene is modified to introduce a hydroxyl group or epoxy group into at least 1 of an olefinically unsaturated bond in the copolymer. The hydroxy or epoxy group can be introduced by oxidization, or adding an OH containing compound e.g. a thiol or phenol , or epoxy group compound e.g. a thiol . The modified polymer has excellent adhesion to inks, paints and metals and excellent strength as a binder for resins.
