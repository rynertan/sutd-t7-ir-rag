# Brick moulding device.

## Abstract
A device for moulding brick blanks comprises a plurality of moulding troughs 6 and a casting device 23 for filling the moulding troughs 6 wherein said casting device 23 com prises a carrier 25 coupled with a casting mechanism 24 and adapted to pivot by means of the casting mechanism 24 between a receiving position and a delivery position. For mitigating or avoiding the drawbacks of the heavy shocks at the impact of the casting mechanism 24 in the de livery position the casting mechanism 24 is caused to drive and guide the carrier 25 in a manner such that when ap proaching the delivery position the carrier 25 is subjected to considerable deceleration.
