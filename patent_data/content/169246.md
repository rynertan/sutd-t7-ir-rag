## Description
SPECIFICATION PARA HYDROXYBENZOATE TECHNICAL FIELD AND DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to novel benzyl p p hydroxybenzoyloxy benzoate represented by the formula EMI1.1 The compound of formula I of this invention can be prepared, for example, by allowing to react p acetoxybenzoyl chloride and benzyl p hydroxybenzoate under heating in a suitable solvent in the presence of an amine to obtain benzyl p p acetoxybenzoyloxy benzoate and hydrolyzing it in the usual way. The objective compound can be purified by a conventional process such as column chromatography, recrystallization, etc. The compound of this invention has a repellency action to unhygienic pests, e.g. cockroach, termite, etc. and a germicidal action. Hence, this compound is useful as a pestrepellent and a germicide, particularly industrial germicide. In using the compound of this invention as a pest repellent, the compound mixed with a usual carrier for pest repellents is kneaded in a material from which repellency of unhygienic pests is intended, such as synthetic plastics, e.g. polyvinyl chloride, coated on such material with a brush, spray, etc., or impregnated in it. On the other hand, in using the compound of this invention as a germicide, the compound mixed with a usual carrier for germicides is used, for example, as a hand disinfectant, an antiseptic coating in which the compound is incorporated, etc. The amount in which the compound of this invention can be used may vary depending on the mode of use, and is such an amount that allows it to exhibit repellency action to unhygienic pests and germicidal action. For instance, the compound may be compounded, based on one part by weight of a carrier, usually in an amount of 0.5 10 parts by weight for a pest repellent and in an amount of 0.01 5 parts by weight for a germicide.Example 1 Into a 200 ml four neck flask equipped with a cooling tube and thermometer are charged 36 g of p acetoxybenzoic acid and 0 1.4 g of thionyl chloride to make them react at 50 C for 4 hours. Excess thionyl chloride is distilled off under reduced pressure to result in p acetoxybenzoyl chloride. Thereafter, 45.7 g of benzyl p hydroxybenzoate, 20.2 g of triethylamine and 100 ml of toluene are similarly charged into 300 ml fourneck flask equipped with a cooling pipe, thermometer and dropping o funnel. The mixture is raised to 30 C and a solution of 39.7 g of p acetoxybenzoyl chloride in 50 g of toluene is dropped into the mixture over a period of 1 hour and subsequently, the resulting mixture is allowed to react at 50 0C for 30 minutes.After cooling, the reaction solution is washed with 50 ml of water three times and the solvent is distilled off. The residue is recrystallized from methanol to obtain benzoyl p p acetoxybenzoyloxy benzoate. Then, 15.6 g of benzyl p p acetoxybenzoyloxy benzoate, 30 g of 5 sodium hydroxide and 50 ml of tetrahydrofuran are likewise charged into a 100 ml four neck flask equipped with a 0 cooling tube and thermometer and allowed to react at 30 C for 5 hours. The reaction product is extracted with toluene and washed with water, and the toluene is distilled off. The residue is separated by column chromatography to give benzyl p p hydroxybenzoyloxy benzoate as white crystals melting at 137 138.5 C. Experimental Example 1 The compound of this invention is dissolved in methanol to prepare a 10,000 ppm solution. A rectangle filter paper of 12 x 9 cm in size is impregnated with 1 ml of the solution, air dried, and attached to a veneer shelter having 12 x 9 cm bottom size and 1 cm height on its inner bottom. Another shelter is likewise attached with a filter paper impregnated with 1 ml of methanol. Respective shelters are placed in a plastic container and 200 German cockroaches are released in it. After standing overnight, number of them dwelling in each of the shelters is counted, and repellency rate is computed by the equation EMI3.1 tb SEP Number SEP in SEP non Number SEP in tb repellency SEP rate SEP SEP SEP treated SEP shelter SEP t SEP shelter SEP SEP SEP tb SEP Number SEP in SEP non treated SEP shelter tb The results obtained are shown in Table 1.

The compound of this invention is mixed and diluted with nutrient agar medium to adjust it to a required concentration. Then, a solution of staphylococcus aureus FDA 209 p or bacillus subtilis PCI 219 is inoculated on the agar medium obtained above and cultivated at 37 0C for 24 hours.
