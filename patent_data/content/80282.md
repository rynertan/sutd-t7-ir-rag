# Pressure device.

## Abstract
An overpressure device for applying pressure from a first hydraulic fluid to a second hydraulic fluid comprises a housing 20 in which is located a piston 1 , an opening 7 in the housing 20 for the entry of the first hydraulic fluid to one side of the piston 1 , a second opening 12 in the housing 20 for the entry of the second hydraulic fluid to a chamber on the other side of the piston 1 whereby the pressure of the first hydraulic fluid is exerted on the second hydraulic fluid, and an additional means 5 of exerting pressure on the piston 1 so that pressure exerted on the second hydraulic fluid is greater than that of the first hydraulic fluid alone.
