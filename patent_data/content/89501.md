This sealing fin 9 is folded down along at least parts of its length against the top end wall 8 and is retained in its folded down position. The said sealing fin 9 has one or more cuts 6, 15 or perforations weakening the packing material, arranged preferably at right angles to the sealing fin 9 in the material layer of the sealing fin 9 which is nearest to the top end wall in the folded down position of the sealing fin 9 .
