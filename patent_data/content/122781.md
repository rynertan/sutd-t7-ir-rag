## Description
CORROSION INHIBITORS, METHODS OF PRODUCING THEM AND PROTECTIVE COATINGS CONTAINING THEM The present invention relates to a method of producing corrosion inhibitors comprising metal oxides and containing metal ions which are suitable for use in protective coatings, eg paints. It is known that certain metal cations, eg calcium and zinc have corrosion inhibiting properties and that inorganic oxides e.g.silica or alumina containing these cations can be included in protective coatings. Such corrosion inhibitors, their methods of preparation and use are claimed and described in published European patent application No 0046057. This publication states that the corrosion inhibitor comprises particles of an inorganic oxide which is silica or alumina having corrosion inhibiting cation 5, such as calcium or zinc cations, chemically bound to the particles. Suitable silicas specified for use in the ion exchange process have a BSS mesh size in the range 8 16 corresponding to particle diameters of about 1000 to 2000 microns in one case and a BSS mesh size of 60 120 corresponding to particle diameters of about 125 to 250 microns in another case. Gasil 200 particle size 4.5 microns is also specified as a suitable inorganic oxide. The ion exchange is carried out by stirring the inorganic oxide in water at ambient temperature and the substance to be exchanged, such as calcium hydroxide, is added slowly while not allowing the pH to rise above 10.5 for silica or 12 for alumina. When exchange is complete the silica or alumina can be washed and dried under vacuum prior to being incorporated in a protective coating. when used in protective coatings the particles should be suitably anall so as to remain in suspension in the composition before application and so as not to substantially affect the ease of application or the smoothness of the dry coating. Suitable particle sizes may be up to 25 microns and are preferably less than 20 microns. If the particles are initially of larger size they have to be milled after ion exchange, but a convenient alternative method of preparation would be to use inorganic oxide particles which already have the preferred small size, thereby avoiding a milling step. Accordingly, the present invention is a method of producing ion exchanged metal oxides said process comprising reacting with agitation an aqueous suspension of a metal oxide selected from silica and alumina having surface hydroxyl groups and an average particle diameter of less than 25 microns with a source of corrosion inhibiting cations and recovering the ion exchanged metal oxide characterised in that the reaction is carried out at or below 15 C while maintaining the pH of the reaction mixture from 7 to 9. The sflicas or aluminas which have surface hydroxyl groups are capable of exchanging the hydrogen atom in the hydroxyl groups for cation s. The average particle diameter of the metal oxide used as starting material is suitably from 5 to 20 microns, preferably from 10 to 20 microns. The metal oxide having surface hydroxyl groups, e.g. silica is suitably microporous having an average pore diameter of less than 30 Angstroms, preferably between 10 and 25 Angstroms. The metal oxide is preferably silica. The preferred cations are calcium Ca2 or zinc Zn2 cations but other suitable cations may be cobalt Co2 , lead pub2 strontium Sr2 , lithium Li , barium Ba2 and magnesium Mg2 . The source of the cations may be their ionisable salts e.g. the hydroxides. The ion exchange reaction between the aqueous suspension of the starting metal oxide and the cation source, eg calcium hydroxide, is carried out at or below 150C, preferably from 8 120C. The reaction mixture comprising an aqueous suspension of the metal oxide and a cation source, which is preferably silica and calcium hydroxide respectively, has to be stirred continuously. It is surprising that under these conditions a substantial portion of the silica may be ion exchanged within 0.5 hours of the start of the reaction. The cation exchange reaction is suitably carried out by stirring the active metal oxide of appropriate particle size in water at or below 15 C to form a suspension and the pH monitored by a meter. The cation source, eg calcium hydroxide is then added slowly to the metal oxide suspended in water, whilst maintaining the pH from 7 to 9. A solution of a highly soluble salt eg nitrate of the cation is preferably added to the reactants to provide a high concentration of the cations in the reaction mixture to suppress the rapid dissolution of the cation source and thereby to control the rate of rise of the pH of the reaction. The pH needs to be high enough to absorb the hydrogen ion generated by the ion exchange but not so high as to dissolve the metal oxide.The uptake of metal cations can be followed by observing the fall of pH over a period of time following the addition of the compound. When the pH no longer falls after the addition of the base then exchange is complete. The reaction products are then suitably washed with distilled water several times and then the ion exchanged product is dried, preferably spray dried. Spray drying is preferably carried out with an aqueous slurry of the ion exchanged active metal oxide which has a solids content of less than 50 wiw, most preferably from 15 30 wiw. The spray drying temperature is suitably above 1000C, preferably from 250 450 C such that the outlet temperature of the spray dried material is from 60 1400C. In the case of calcium ion exchanged silica the spray dried product may have a calcium ion content of 3 7 w w of the total product. The spray dried product can be used in pigment formulation without the need for further grinding or other processing. The present invention is further illustrated with reference to the following Example. 500 kg of silica having surface hydroxyl groups, a surface area of 700 m2 g and at least 80Z w w of which had an average particle size below 20 microns and a pore diameter of 20 25 Angstroms was mixed by stirring with calcium hydroxide 60 kg whilst maintaining the pH of the reaction mixture between 7 and 9 and the reaction temperature between 10 and 12 C. The stirring was continued for ten minutes and the product thereafter washed with distilled water. An aqueous suspension of the washed ion exchanged material containing 20 30X w w of solids was spraydried and eleven batches of ionexchanged material were produced. These batches were analysed byX ray fluorescence to determine the ion exchangeable calcium content of the particles, as measured by the following test method Test Method 5g of the calcium exchanged silica were added to a solution of 150g of NaCl in 850 ml water. The mixture was agitated for 16 hours at 20 C. The mixture was then filtered and the particles washed and dried. The calcium content of the particles was determined by X ray fluorescence and the amount of calcium in ion exchangeable form calculated by subtracting this value from the calcium content as measured before the test. The results of analysis of the eleven batches somme of which analyses were carried out in duplicate were as follows EMI5.1 tb Batch SEP No. SEP X SEP w w tb SEP Ion SEP exchangeable tb SEP Calcium SEP content tb SEP 1 SEP 3.0 tb SEP 3.2 tb SEP 2 SEP 3.0 tb SEP 3 SEP 3.3 tb SEP 4 SEP 2.3 SEP tb SEP 2.3 tb SEP 5 SEP 3.2 tb SEP 6 SEP 3.2 tb SEP 3.1 SEP tb SEP 7 SEP 3.1 tb SEP 2.5 tb SEP 8 SEP 3.4 tb SEP 3.15 tb SEP 9 SEP 3.15 tb SEP 10 SEP 3.35 tb SEP 3.15 tb SEP 11 SEP 3.4 tb Comparative Test not according to the invention . The process of the Example was repeated using a temperature of 20 C. The resultant product had only 2.7 w w of calcium in the ion exchangeable form, as measured by the above Test Method.
