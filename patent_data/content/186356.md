# Metallic thin film magnetic recording medium having a hard protective layer.

## Abstract
A metallic, thin film, magnetic recording medium is disclosed wherein the surface of the metallic thin film is modified such as to promote improved adhesion with protective lubricant. A process is disclosed wherein, for example, controlled oxidation of a metallic, thin film magne tic recording medium yields a homogeneous distribution of bonding sites and wherein application of a protective lubricant e.g., perfluoropolyether compositions provides a recording medium exhibiting superior wear and abrasion resistance.
