# MONITORING APPARATUS

## Abstract
Monitoring apparatus comprises a lens structure includ ing lenses 5 and a reflector element 6 which reflects light rays passing through these lenses 5 , thereby changing the first optical axis along which they pass before being reflected into the second optical axis directed to a different angle and which is further equipped with a camera element 13 for taking a picture image of an object body, which image has been reflected from the reflector element 6 and a drive 10,11 for rotating the lens structure 5,6 with this second optical axis as its center, to enable monitoring of a wide range of field of vision.
