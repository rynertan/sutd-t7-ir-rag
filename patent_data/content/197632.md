## Description
The present invention relates to a pumping apparatus in which a pair of pumping pistons in respective cylinders are driven with opposite phases to draw material in from a hopper and expel into a pipe. EP A 0085521 describes such a pump which is intended for pumping concrete or other types of slurry from a hopper into a pipeline. Two pumping pistons in respective cylinders are driven with opposite phases to alternately draw slurry from the hopper and force it along the pipeline. The pistons are driven by respective hydraulic actuators which comprise double acting pistons slidable in cylinders. DE A 1653478 describes another example of a pump in which two pumping pistons in respective cylinders are driven with opposite phases. According to the present invention there is provided a pumping apparatus, comprising first and second variable volume pumping cylinders 16 , first and second pumping members 12 reciprocal within the first and second pumping cylinders, respectively, to vary the volume thereof, the pumping cylinders each having an inlet for the introduction of material to be pumped and an outlet for the delivery of material from the pumping cylinder, first and second actuators 14 coupled to the first and second pumping members respectively, and operable to reciprocate the pumping members, the first and second actuators driving the first and second pumping members with mutually opposite phases, a hydraulic fluid sump 64 and pump 54 connected to the pump for the supply of hydraulic pressure fluid to each actuator, wherein each actuator 14 comprises an actuator cylinder 24 , a hollow plunger 26 located within the cylinder 24 , a hollow cylindrical partition 28 fixed with respect to the cylinder 24 and arranged within the plunger 26 , the partition 28 cooperating with the plunger 26 and the cylinder 24 to define first and second drive chambers 30a, 30b having different working areas, the first drive chamber being defined by the interior of the hollow cylindrical portion and the interior of the plunger and the second drive chamber being defined by the exterior of the partition and the interior of the actuator cylinder 24 and the end of the plunger remote from the pumping cylinder, the plunger 26 being slidable in the cylinder bore and with respect to the said hollow cylindrical partition 28 to vary the volumes of said drive chambers 30a, 30b , the first and second valves 70 being connected between the sump 64 and the first drive chambers of the first and second actuators 14 respectively to allow pressure fluid to be pumped directly to the first and second drive chambers respectively, each valve being operable to shut off flow of hydraulic fluid from the supply to one of the drive chambers of the associated actuator 14 to determine the pumping force transmitted to the associated pumping member 12 , said first and second valves comprising two single or one double selector valve, and a manual valve control 71 for controlling operation of the first and second valves so that, at any given time, the valves are in the same position and pressure fluid is supplied on alternate strokes to corresponding drive chambers in the first and second actuators. The ability to select the drive chambers to which hydraulic pressure is supplied enables the force provided by the actuator to be selected while the hydraulic pressure supplied to the actuators remains constant. Thus, in the pump embodying the invention, the pressure at which material is pumped can be selected without changing the hydraulic supply pressure. This is not possible in the known pumps described above, and consequently those pumps cannot pump any particular material through more than a fixed maximum height. The maximum height through which a material may be pumped by a pump embodying the present invention can be changed by changing the selection of chambers supplied with pressurised fluid. Accompanying a change in the selection, there is a change in the pumping speed. Thus, when the pump is required to pump to a greater height, a high pumping pressure can be selected with correspondingly reduced delivery flow whereas when pumping to a lower height is required, a lower pumping pressure can be selected so as to increase the pumping speed and delivery flow. Regardless of these changes, the means supplying hydraulic fluid to the actuators can be operated to supply constant power at their most efficient setting. A temporary increase in pumping pressure may be used if material is being pumped through a pipeline and the pipeline becomes blocked. The sudden increase in pumping pressure which is obtained by changing the selection of drive chambers in use may be sufficient to clear the blockage, thereby avoiding the need to turn off the pump and manually find and clear the blockage. An embodiment of the invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 shows a slurry pump 10 having two reciprocatable pumping pistons 12 driven by respective hydraulic actuators 14. The pistons 12 are reciprocated in respective pumping cylinders 16 which are in communication with the interior of a hopper 18 filled with slurry to be pumped. The pistons 12 are reciprocated with opposite phases, so that during each half of the pumping cycle, slurry is drawn into one cylinder 16 and expelled from the other. Slurry expelled from a cylinder 16 is forced along a delivery tube 20 and along a delivery pipe line 22. The delivery tube 20 is pivotally mounted at its lower end and its upper end is swung into and out of communication with the cylinders 16 alternately, so as to be always in communication with the cylinder 16 which is expelling slurry. The delivery tube 20 is swung by means of a hydraulic actuator 20a comprising double acting pistons in one or two cylinders. Only one cylinder is shown. A second may be desirable to supplement the swinging force applied to the tube 20, for instance when the tube 20 is large and a larger force is needed to move the tube against the frictional resistance to movement of the tube end. The structure of each actuator 14 is shown in Fig. 2. Each actuator 14 comprises a cylinder 24 and a plunger 26 slidable in and closing the cylinder. The plunger 26 is connected to the corresponding piston 12 by a drive rod 15. The position of the cylinder is fixed in relation to the hopper 18. The chamber between the plunger 26 and the cylinder 24 is partitioned by a hollow cylindrical partition 28 coaxial with the cylinder 24, to define two closed drive chambers 30a, 30b. Sliding movement of the plunger 26 in the cylinder 24 varies the volumes of the chambers 30a, 30b. Composite annular seals 32, 33 located in grooves in the partition 28 and the plunger 26 respectively provide sliding seals between the partition 28 and the plunger 26, and between the plunger 26 and the cylinder 24. Hydraulic fluid is selectively supplied under pressure to the chambers 30a, 30b through supply ports 34a, 34b. Hydraulic fluid supplied through the port 34a passes along the bore 36 of the partition 28 to act on the face 38 of the plunger 26 and urges the plunger 26 along the axis of the cylinder 24 to the left as seen in Fig. 2. Hydraulic pressure supplied through the port 34b acts on the annular faces 40 of the plunger, and also urges the plunger to the left as seen in Fig. 2. The actuator 14 further comprises an annular return chamber 42, between the plunger 26 and the cylinder 24. The return chamber 42 is sealed from the drive chamber 30b by the seal 33 around the plunger 26. A collar 44 is fixed to the cylinder 24, and has grooves in which further seals 46 are located to seal the return chamber 42 from the outside of the cylinder 24. Each actuator has a supply port 48 communicating with its return chamber 42. The supply ports 48, and hence the return chambers 42 are interconnected by a pipeline 76. When the plunger 26 of one actuator 14 is being extended, fluid is driven out of the return chamber 42 of that actuator and into the return chamber 42 of the other actuator 14 where it acts on a shoulder 50 on the plunger 26 to drive the plunger to the fully retracted position shown in Fig. 2. Accordingly, the plungers move with opposite phases. Fig. 2 also shows a linkage 80 provided between the plunger 26 of one of the actuators and a spool valve 82. The function of the spool valve is to control the reciprocation of the plungers 26 as will be described later. The linkage 80 comprises a steel rod 84 attached to a yoke 86 by a nut 88. The yoke is attached to the drive rod 15, so that the yoke 86 and the rod 84 move with the plunger 26. The rod 84 travels inside a tube 90 which is slidable in a mounting 92. Movement of the cube 90 in the mounting 92 is limited by stops 94a,94b mounted on the tube 90. The end of the tube 90 away from the mounting 92 is attached to the operating spool 96 of the valve 82 by a shear pin 98. Two short springs 100,102 are located around the rod 84, between the stop 94a which extends a short way into the tube 90 and the yoke 86, and between the stop 94a and a nut 104 on the free end of the rod 84. The linkage 80 operates in the following manner. When the plunger 26 is moving away from the retracted position shown in Fig.2, the rod 84 moves with it, towards the left of that figure. Eventually, near the end of the stroke, the nut 104 makes contact with the spring 102, which transmits a force to the stop 94a to move the tube 90, and hence the spool 96, until the stop 94b abuts the mounting 92. A catch within the valve 82 holds the spool in this position. Ideally, the stop 94b abuts the mounting 92 at the end of the plunger stroke, but any overrun is taken up by the spring 102. On the return stroke of the plunger, the rod 84 is retracted into the tube 90 until the yoke 86 bears on the spring 100. The spring 100 pushes on the stop 94a to move the tube 90 in the mounting 92 until the stop 94a abuts the mounting 92. This movement returns the spool 96 to its original position where it is retained by the catch. The spring 100 absorbs any overrun of the plunger 26 during this phase of its movement. Fig. 3 shows both actuators 14 and the circuit 52 for supplying hydraulic fluid to them. The Figure is schematic for reasons of clarity. In particular, the linkage 80 is shown simply, in broken lines. The circuit 52 comprises a swash plate pump 54 driven by a diesel engine not shown . The pump 54 has a swash plate 56 which causes pistons 58 to reciprocate in a ring of cylinders 60 only two of which are shown . The swash plate is driven by a rotating shaft 61 and the direction in which fluid is pumped between the pipes 66,68 can be reversed by rocking the swash plate 56 on the end of the shaft 61. Reversal of the swash plate 56 is effected by an actuator 104 to which pressurised fluid is supplied under the control of the valve 82, from a small pump 62. The pump 62 draws fluid from a sump 64. The pumping delivery can be varied by changing the angle of the swash plate 56 to its rotation axis, thereby varying the stroke length of the pistons 58, or by changing the throttle setting of the engine driving the pump 54. The engine is set to run at a speed to generate optimum power, and the volume delivered by the pump 54 is set by the angle of the swash plate 56. Thereafter, the swash plate position remains the same except for reversal by the actuator 104. The pipe 66 and the pipe 68 are both branched and connect the pump 54 to the supply ports 34b of the drive chambers 30b of respective actuators 14, and to one port of a respective three way valve 70. A pipe 72 connects a second port of each valve 70 to the supply port 34a of the drive chamber 30a of one of the actuators 14. A pipe 74 connects the third ports of the valves 70 to the sump 64. A further pipe 76 connects the return chambers 42 of the actuators 14. The valves 70 have two positions. In the first position, shown in Fig. 3, they connect the piping 72 to the piping 74. Thus the chambers 30a of both actuators 14 are vented to the sump 64, while the pump 54 pumps fluid from the drive chamber 30b of one actuator 14 to the equivalent drive chamber 30b of the other actuator 14. In the second position, shown in Fig. 4, the pipes 66,68 are connected to the corresponding pipes 72. The pump now supplies hydraulic fluid to both drive chambers 30a, 30b of one of the actuators by pumping from the chambers 30a, 30b of the other actuator 14. The valves 70 are provided by two single or one double selector valve controlled by a single, manually operated control indicated at 71. When the slurry pump 10 is in use, the operator sets the positions of the valves 70 together, by operating the control 71. When the valves 70 are in the positions shown in Fig. 3, and with the actuators in the positions shown there, hydraulic pressure acts on the face 40 of the plunger 26 in the actuator shown at the top of the figure. The plunger of the upper actuator 14 is driven to the left, and as it moves, hydraulic fluid is expelled from the return chamber 42 of the upper actuator 14. The expelled fluid passes along the pipe 76 and enters the return chamber 42 of the lower actuator 14, to retract the plunger of the lower actuator from the extended position shown. Fluid continues to pass in this way until the plunger of the lower actuator is fully retracted and the plunger of the upper actuator is fully extended. At this point, the valve 82 controlling the swash plate moves to its other position, and so reverses the swash plate angle. The direction in which the pump 54 is pumping, and the directions of movement of the plungers then reverse. The plungers are driven with a smaller force by comparison with the situation to be described with reference to Fig. 4 when the valves 70 are in the position shown In Figure 3, because hydraulic pressure bears on the faces 40, but not on the faces 38. In order to fully extend a plunger, only the chamber 30b is filled, so that only a relatively small volume of fluid must be provided by the pump 54. Consequently, the plungers move quickly, and for a fixed setting of the pump 54 and the diesel engine driving the pump 54, the situation shown in Fig. 3 results in the pump 10 pumping slurry with a relatively low pumping force, but at a relatively high rate. When the valves 70 are in the positions shown in Fig. 4, hydraulic fluid acts on the faces 38 as well as acting on the faces 40. For the same setting of the pump 54 and of the engine driving it, that is, for the same fluid supply pressure, the plunger 26 is driven with a greater force than when the valves 70 are in the positions shown in Fig. 3. However the volume of fluid which must be pumped in order fully to extend the plunger is also increased because both drive chambers 30a, 30b are filled. The plungers move more slowly in comparison with the arrangement of Fig. 3. Accordingly, the arrangement of Fig. 4 operates the pump 10 to pump with a larger pumping force but at a slower rate. In the arrangement of Fig. 4, as in the arrangement of Fig. 3, one plunger 26 is driven out until it is fully extended, whereupon the pumping direction of the pump 54 is reversed, to extend the other plunger 26. As each plunger extends, it expels fluid from the corresponding return chamber 42 into the other return chamber 42 to retract the other plunger 26. The output of the pump 62 may be used additionally for topping up the hydraulic system including the return chambers in the event of leakages. An alternative linkage for controlling the valve 82 uses pilot valves like the one shown in Fig. 5. The pilot valve 150 is mounted on the cylinder 24. For clarity, only a small portion of the cylinder 24 is shown in Fig.5 and a plunger 26 is not shown. The valve 150 is a spool valve having a spool 152 and three ports 154, 156, 158. In the position shown, the ports 154 and 158 are in communication around the neck 160 of the spool 152. The land 162 closes the port 156. The lower end 164 as shown in Fig.5 of the spool 152 penetrates the wall of the cylinder 24. A spring 166 urges the spool 152 to this position. The lower end 164 of the spool 152 is so positioned within the cylinder 24 that the spool 152 will be pressed upwardly to a raised position by the plunger in the cylinder 24, when the plunger reaches the one end of its stroke. In the raised position of the spool 152, the land 162 is above and clear of the port 156 which communicates with the port 154 around the neck 160. A second land 168 closes the port 158. The valve 150 is therefore a two position changeover valve, able to connect the port 154 selectably to the port 156 or the port 158. Figure 6, which is highly schematic, shows how two such valves 150 can be used to control the valve 82 to reverse the direction of drive of the plungers of two actuators. The valves 150 are located at opposite ends of the stroke of the plunger 26 in one of the cylinders 24. The port 156 of each valve 150 is supplied with pressurised fluid over a line 170. The ports 158 are vented over a line 172. The ports 154 are connected through a double chack valve 174 to the two position spool valve 82. The ports 154 supply pressure to respective ends of the spool of the valve 82, so that pressure supplied through one or other of the ports 154 will change the state of the valve 82 and reverse the plungers 26. The double check valve 174 includes a one way check valve in the line between each of the ports 154 and the valve 82. The check valves allow fluid flow from the ports 154 to the valve 82. The check valve 174 also includes an over ride facility which allows pressure from the port 154 of either of the valves 150 to over ride the check valve in the line from the port 154 of the other valve 150. The circuit of Figure 6 operates in the following way. In mid stroke of the pistons 26, both valves 150 will be in the position shown in Figures 5 and 6. The ports 154 are vented over the line 172. When the plunger 26 reaches the end of its stroke, the valve 150 at that end of the stroke is operated to move to its other position, in which the port 154 is connected to the pressurised line 170. Pressurised fluid passes from the port 156 to the port 154, then through the cheeck valve, finally bearing on the spool of the valve 82 to change the state of the valve 82. The check valve between the other valve 150 and the spool valve 82 is overridden so that fluid displaced by the spool can vent through that other valve 150 and over the line 172. The change of the state of the valve 82 reverses the plungers 26 so that they move away from their end positions. The valves 150 revert to the states shown, with both ports 154 vented. The spool of the valve 82 is held in position by the check valve 174. When the plungers reach the other end of their strokes, the other valve 150 is operated to move the spool of the valve 82 back, to reverse the plungers 26 again. The valves 150 are shown in Figure 6 it respective ends of the stroke of the same plunger. They could be operated at the same end of the stroke of respective plungers. The valves 150 could be used to control one or more intermediate valves rather than to control the valve 82 directly. The intermediate valves could be used to reverse the supply direction of fluid at a pilot pressure much lover than the pressure of fluid to the actuators 14. The pilot pressure would be used to control not only the valve 82, but also other functions. For instance, a delay could be introduced between the operation of the valves 150 and the change of the valve 82, to allow the tube 20 to be moved to the other pumping cylinder 16 before the pistons 12 recommence movement. The European patent application referred to above describes a clamping arrangement for sealing the tube around the openings of the cylinders 16. This sealing clamping pressure would be reduced to allow the tube 20 to swing, in sealing contact with a flat surface and then be reapplied. This sequence of operations would take place during the delay and be triggered by the changeover of the valve controlled by the valves 150. Figure 6 also shows lines 176 and 178 connected to respective ends of the spool valve controlled by the valves 150. Pressure on the lines 176, 178 is controlled by a manually operable valve, not shown, which allows the operation of the valves 150 to be overridden, to reverse the plungers in mid stroke.
