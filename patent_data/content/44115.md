# Thermosetting coating composition containing a blocked acid catalyst.

## Abstract
Thermosetting coating composition having incorporated therein an acid curable amino resin and such an amount of a blocked acid as corresponds to 0,1 to 10 per cent by weight, calculated on the amino resin of potentially available sulpho nic acid. In order to reduce the electric conductivity of the composition after a pot life of at least several weeks the blocked acid to be used is selected from the group of sulphonic acid oximates. The compositions are suitable to be applied to a substrate by electrostatic spraying.
