# Alternating current generator.

## Abstract
A generator 10 for referencing to the frequency of the alternating current of a public utility comprising an annular exciter stator 11 including a plurality of exci ter electromagnetic poles 13, 14 connected for excitation by said alternating current for producing a first magnetic vector therebetween at an angle rate corresponding to the frequency of said alternating current, said exciter stator 11 including a rotary mounting 56 for the angular alignment thereof and an arcuate rack 52 formed on the exterior an exciter rotor 15 mounted for rotation on the interior of said exciter stator 11 , said exciter rotor 15 including a plurality of electromagnat exciter inductors conformed for inductive coupling with said exciter poles 13, 14 for produc ing an excited current thereon of a phase and frequency cor responding to the summation of said angular rate of said first magnet vector and the rotational rate of said exciter rotor 15 a generating rotor 35 connected for common rotation with said exciter rotor 15 , said generating rotor 35 includ ing a plurality of electromagnetic generating inductors cor responding to said exciter inductors and connected in oppo site alignment therewith, said generating inductors being displaced in angle relative said exciter inductors whereby a second magnetic vector of opposite angular rate to that of said exciting current is produced by said generating induc tors an angular generating stator 12 mounted in surround ing relationship around said generating rotor, said generating stator including a plurality of electromagnetic generating poles 33, 34 aligned for electromagnetic induction by the advance of said magnetic vector on the interior thereof power means P connected for angular advancement of said exciter 15 and generating 35 rotor a servo motor 50 connected for engagement with said rack 52 for angular advancement of said stator 11 and, phase comparing means connected to said alternating current, and the signal induced on said generating poles for advancing said servo motor 50 in rotation according to the phase difference therebetween
