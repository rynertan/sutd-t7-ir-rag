# Disc brake caliper assembly.

## Abstract
A metal protector 10 for a disc brake piston boot attached to a pad backing plate. The protector has a main surface area 11 substantially equal in outline to the pad backing plate. Flanges 12, 13 are used to attach the protector to the backing plate. The protector may be coated with a lubricant or acoustic damping material to assist in minimising squeal and chatter.

## Claims
C L A I M S 1.

A metal protector according to Claim 1, wherein a coating film having lubricating and or vibrating absorbing functions is formed on at least one surface of said main plate. 3. A metal protector according to Claim 1, wherein a coating film having lubricating and or vibrating absorbing functions is formed on both surfaces of said protector plate. 4. A metal protector according to Claims 1, 2 or 3 further comprising detent members adapted to attach said protector plate to said pad backing plate at each end of said protector plate. 5. A disc brake of the tame having a piston boot in rhich a caliper 10 supported to be slidable in the axial direction of a disc pad and a pad backing plate through pins fixedly secured to both ends of said caliper and slidably inserted in a stationary member, and incorporating a metal protector plate according to any one of the preceding claims.

## Description
This invention relates to a metal protector for preventing damage to a piston boot, which is attached to a pad backing plate of a disc brake. The attachment of a plate member to the pad backing plate has been employed in order to prevent squeal generally caused by brake pads when the brakes are applied. However, in conventional types of disc brakes, particularly the pin slide type, frequently accident occurs when the caliper is removed and reset thereafter in order to check and replace the Ia ds. In these situations the piston boot may be damaged by contacting thepiate member of the pad backing plate. Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to prevent the above mentioned damage to the piston boot.Another object of this invention is to provide an improved disc brake assembly that can be easily manufactured and also offers improved safety features. Briefly, in accordance with this invention, these objects are accomplished by attaching a metal protector for a piston boot to a pad backing plate. The metal protector is provided with a main plate substantially identical in outline shape to the pad backing plate shape. A flange on an upper edge of the main plate is adapted to attach the main plate to the pad backing plate and detent attachment pieces may also be provided, preferably at each end of the main plate. Further, the objects may be more effectively accomplished by providing a coating film which serves to lubricate either or both of the protector surfaces and thus helps to dampen, or absorb any vibrational chattering and squeal on either or both of said surfaces. The invention will now be descw en y sf example, with reference to the accompanying drawin s, in which Figure 1 is a perspective view showing a metal protector according to the present invention Figure 2 is a side view showing the metal protector attached to a brake pad and Figure 3 is a plan view showing one form of disc brake to which the present invention is applied. As shown in Figures 1 and 2, of the drawings, a metal protector 10 comprises a main plate 11 substantially identical in outline shape to a pad backing plate 2 integral with a pad 1. A flange 12 is provided along part of an upper edge of the main plate 11 to form part of attachment means for the plate and detent pieces 13 are disposed on opposite sides of the plate 11, serving to attach the plate 11 to respective ear portions provided on the pad backing plate 2. The metal protector 10 is attached to the pad backing plate 2 as shown in Figure 2 and the pad thus attached is employed in a disc brake as shown in Figure 3. In Figure 3, pins 4 and 4 are fixedly secured to both ends of a caliper 3 and slidably inserted into a stationary member 5. As a result, the caliper 3 is floatingly supported. The pad backing plate 2 engages an inside portion of the stationary member 5 and is pressed against a disc D by a piston 6 incorporated in the caliper 3. A piston boot 7 is mounted between an inlet of a cylinder having the piston 6 and the piston itself to thereby prevent entrance of dust into the cylinder. In a disc brake of this construction, in order to check or replace the pads, one of the pins 4 and 4 is first removed and the caliper 3 is rotated about the remaining pin. Thus, the pad 1 is exposed and removed according to wear or maintenance schedules. After checking or replacement of the pad 1, the caliper is reversely rotated to thereby return to its original position. At this time, since the pins 4 and 4 are slidably inserted into the stationary member 5, the caliper 3 is liable to closely approach the stationary member 5. Accordingly, there may be a danger that the piston boot 7 will come into contact with the pad backing plate 8 during rotation of the caliper 3 and be damaged by the backing plate.However, in the present invention, the flange 12 provided on the upper side of the metal protector 10 covers the corners and upper edges of the badcingplate 2 and p otential damage to the piston boot 7 due to the sharp corners of the backing plate 2 can be prevented. Further, in order to prevent squeal caused by the brake pads, it is preferable to form a coating film on the metal protector which serves to lubricate either or both of the metal protector surfaces and this helps to dampen or absorb any vibrational chattering and squeal on either or both of said surfaces. Thus, according to the present invention, the metal protector plate can serve to prevent not only the squeal caused by the pads but also damage to the piston boot.Moreover, it can be made merely by stamping out and bending from thin metal plate, resulting in a low manufacturing cost. It is apparent that modifications to this invention are possible without departing from the essential scope thereof.
