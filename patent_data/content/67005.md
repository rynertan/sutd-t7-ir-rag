## Description
FOG PREVENTION he present invention relates to the prevention of fog formation caused by exhaust gases from apparatus such as submerged or immersed combustion vaporisers or heaters. Submerged or immersed combustion vaporisers or heater apparatus are particularly useful for the vaporisation or heating of, for instance, cryogenic fluids such as liquid natural gas L.N.G. . In such apparatus the process fluid, such as L. L.G., is passed through heat exchanger pipes immersed in a water bath. Hot combustion products are then passed through the water bath to heat the water and the process fluid to the desired temperature, the combustion products then being discharged to the atmosphere by an exhaust stack. However, the exhaust gases are frequently saturated with water vapour from the water bath and indeed, entreated moisture may be also carried by the exhaust gases from the water bath. When the exhaust gases come into contact with cooler air on discharge from the exhaust stack, then the moisture in the warm combustion products may condense or form water droplets.This may then cause the formation of clouds of water vapour or small water droplets which, in addition to reducing visibility, dampen the equipment and operating personnel. It is possible to reduce the formation water vapour fog at the exhaust stack of such apparatus by super heating the combustion products in the stack to above the saturation temperature, so that the exhaust gases do not immediately cool on leaving the stack and so do not form a fog cloud.However, super heating s ubstantially increases the operating costs of the system whether the stack gases are re heated by combustion products or by indirect heat exchange with the hot water from the water bath. The energy requirements are often further increased by the presence of entrained moisture from the water bath, which requires latent heat of vaporisation as well as super heating. In cold climates, super heating does not prevent condensation of water vapour at the exhaust stack, but merely increases the height at which the fog cloud is formed. An alternative method of reducing fog formation is to lower the temperature of the water bath which reduces the stack temperature and also reduces the amount of water vapour discharged. This method has the disadvantage that if reEtively high temperatures are required for the process fluid then it is impractical to reduce the water bath temperature below a certain level. In addition, low water bath operation temperatures increase the size of the heat exchanger required, because of the decrease in the temperature difference between the water bath and the initial temperature of the process fluid. According to the present invention there is provided a method of reducing the formation of fog by exhaust gases entering the atmosphere from apparatus which includes an immersed combustion heater, the method comprising cooling said exhaust gases prior to the entry of the gases into the atmosphere, so as to remove water vapour carried by said gases. Preferably said apparatus is for the heating or vaporisation of cryogenic fluids. More preferably said fluids are liquid gases such as liquid natural gas or liquid nitrogen. Preferably said cooling of said exhaust gases is by means of contacting said exhaust gases with a fluid of a lower temperature. More preferably said fluid is water. Preferably said contacting is by counter current flow of said exhaust gases and said fluid. More preferably said exhaust gases flow substantially upwardly along an exhaust stack whilst said cooling fluid flows downwardly along said stack. Most preferably said fluid is in the form of a spray. Preferably said exhaust gases are discharged from the exhaust stack through a mist eliminator to prevent the carrying into the atmosphere of entrained moisture. In other embodiments cooling may be effected by means of heat pumps bubble trays or suitably packed columns. The present invention also provides apparatus induding an immersed combustion heater, said apparatus including means for cooling the exhaust gases before discharge to the atmosphere so as to remove water vapour carried by said exhaust gases. A fog prevention method according to the present invention has several advantages over known systems. In operating costIt is substantially cheaper thansuper heating as well as being more effective. It allows the operation of the water bath used in such equipment to be of a temperature as high as may be desired without the problems of fog formation and serious lowering of efficiency. In addition, reduction of the stack temperature to approximately 50C, for instance, increases the net thermal efficiency of a vaporiser according to the present invention to approximately 110 . As an example, the energy saving on a large liquid natural gas vaporiser instaBation could amount to between five hundred thousand and a million pounds per year. An embodiment of the present. invention will now be described by way of example only and with reference to the accompanying drawing which is a schematic diagram of a submerged combustion vaporiser in accordance with the present invention. Referring to the drawing, a submerged combustion vaporiser for the heating of cryogenic fluids such as L.N.G., comprises a first primary heat exchange portion 1 and a secondary heat exchange portion 3. The primary heat exchange portion 1 comprises a substantially conventional submerged combustion vaporiser apparatus. A combustion chamber 7 is fed by fuel via feed pipe 9, and the hot combustion products are vented from the combustion chamber through outlets 11. The combustion products then rise through a water bath 19, heating the water, and are then allowed to leave the vaporiser 5 by means of an exhaust pipe line 21. A process fluid such as L.N.G., is fed through inlet pipes 13 into a tube heat exchanger 15 immersed in the water bath 19. The process fluid then, having been heated by the water bath, leaves that exchanger by outlet pipe 17. The exhaust gases, having heated the water bath, pass along the exhaust pipe 21 to an exhauststack 23. The warm exhaust gases then rise up the stack. The stack 23 is equipped with water sprays 25 at levels above the hight of the inlet of the exhaust pipe 21 into the stack 23. Water from the sprays 25 is directed downwardly counter current to the flow of the exhaust gases up the s ack 23. The temperature of the water flowing from the sprays 25 is considerably cooler than the temperature of the exhaust gases, and may be for instance between 20 and 50C. The contact with the cool water spray reduces the temperature of the exhaust gases during theIr passage up the stack 23. Sufficient numbers of sprays are situated at intervals along the height of the stack 23 so as to reduce the temperature of the exhaust gases.Water vapour carried by the gases is caused to condense and fall down the stack with the original water spray. Having lost substantially all of the water vapour the exhaust gases then pass through a substantially conventional mist separator, comprising a fine grid, which removes any entrained moisture carried by the exhaust gases, which are then vented to the atmosphere at a temperature of between 5 and 10 C approximately. Typically between approximately 90 and 95 of the water carried by the exhaust gases may be removed in the stack 23, and accordingly there is, little or no fog formation on the discharge of the exhaust gases to the atmosphere. The condensed water vapour, together with the entrained water droplets that has been removed from the exhaust gases and the water sprays, fall to the bottom of the stack 23. The water falling to the bottom of the stack 23 has a temperature above that of the original water leaving the grays 25, because of the contact, during the passage down the stack, with the warm exhaust gases. The water is removed from the bottom of the stack 23 by means of a pipe line 27 and pump 29 and taken to a secondary heat exianger. The heat removed from the water may be used to raise the temperature of the process fluid, or for other purposes. The cooled water, having been brought down toa temperature of betweenapproxiriately 20C and Soc is then pumped up to the sprays in the upper portion of the stack 23 to re commence the cycle of the water flow. The above described apparatus may have a net thermal efficiency of between 108 and 110 and is in operating cost considerably cheaper t an known fog prevention systems.
