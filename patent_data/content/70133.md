## Description
SECONDARY AMINES The present invention relates to derivatives of ethanolamine which have anti obesity and or anti hvperglycaemic and or anti inflammatory and or platelet aggregatio inhibition activity, to processes for their production and to their use in medicine. European Patent Application No. 79301197.4 Beechams discloses compounds of formulaEMI1.1 wherein R is hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine, hydroxyl, hydroxymethyl, methyl, methoxy, amino, formamido, acetamido, methylsulphonamido, nitro, benzyloxy, methylsulphonylmethyl, ureido, trifluoromethyl or p methoxybenzylamino1 R2 is hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine or hydroxyl R3 is hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine or hydroxyl R4 is a carboxylic acid group or a salt, ester or amide thereof R5 is hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine, methyl, methoxy, hydroxyl, or a carboxylic acid group or a salt, ester or amide thereof R6 is hydrogen, methyl, ethyl or propyl R7 is hydrogen, methyl, ethyl or propyl X is oxygen or a bond and Y is C16 alkylene or a bond, which possess anti obesity and or hypoglycaemic activity. It has now been discovered that a class of novel phenoxyalkylaminoethanolamine derivatives have anti obesity and orthYneralycaemicand or anti inflammatory and or platelet aggregation inhibition activity. This activity is coupled with low cardiac stimulant activity for particular members of the class. Accordingly, the present invention provides a compound of formula I EMI2.1 and salts and in vivo hydrolysable acyl derivatives thereof, wherein R1 is hydrogen or methyl R2 is hydrogen or methyl R3 is phenyl unsubstituted or substituted with one or two of the following fluorine, chlorine, bromine, trifluoromethyl, C16 straight or branched chain alkyl or C16 straight or branched chain alkoxy or is benzofuran 2 yl R5 is a hydrogen, halogen, hydroxy, lower alkyl or lower alkoxy R4 is moietyEMI2.2 wherein X is CZ 10 alkylene which may be straight or branched provided that the oxygen and nitrogen are separated by at least two carbon atoms XÚ is C19 alkylene which may be straight or branched, A is hydrogen C16 straight or branched alkyl or benzyl optionally substituted with halogen, lower alkyl or lower alkoxy. R is hydrogen C1 6 straight or branched alkyl C16 straight or branched alkylsulphonylEMI3.1 R7 is C16 straight or branched alkyl C1 6 straight or branched alkoxy amino, mono or di C1 6 straight orbranched alkyl amino orEMI3.2 is a 5,6 or 7 membered cyclic amine optionally containing a second hetero atom selected from oxygen, nitrogen and sulphur, and n is 1 or 2Suitable cyclic aminesEMI3.3 include pyrrolidine, piperidine, homopiperidine and morpholine groups. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds of formula I include acid addition salts formed with a pharmaceutically acceptable acid such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, orthophosphoric acid, sulphuric acid, methane sulphonic acid, toluenesulphonic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, lactic acid, citric acid, fumoric acid, malic acid, succinic acid, salicylic acid or acetylsalicyclic acid, The salts of compounds of formula I need not be pharmaceutically acceptable as they are also useful in the preparation of other compounds of formula I and in the separation of stereoisomers of compounds of formula I when the salt ion is also opticall active. In vivo hydrolysable acyl derivatives are those which are converted to compounds of formula I in the body of a patient to whom the acyl derivative has been administered. Compounds of formula I have at least one asymmetric carbon atom, ie the carbon atom bearing the hydroxyl group and R3 and, when 1 and 2 and, when R and R2 are different, the carbon atom bearing R1 and R2 is also asymmetric. The compounds may therefore exist in at least two and often four stereoisomeric forms. The present invention encompasses all stereoisomers of the compounds of formula I whether free from other stereoisomers or admixed with other stereoisomers in any proportion and thus includes, for instance, racemic mixtures of enantiomers, Preferably, the carbon atom bearing the hydroxyl 3 group and R has the R configuration. The most potent compounds of formula I are those wherein R1 and R2 are different and both asymmetric carbon atoms are in the R configuration. The absolute configuration of any compound of formula I may be determined by conventional X ray crystallographic techniques. It is believed that, in the 13C n.m.r. spectrum of compounds of formula I wherein one of R1 and R2is hydrogen and the other is methyl, the diastereoisomer having anti the greater anti obesity and anti hyperglycaemic activity is that for which the signal of the methyl group carbon atom appears at higher field the lower numerical value when expressed in ppm in d6DMSO solution. The paired resonances often appear at approximately 20 ppm less active and slightly below 20 ppm more active down field from tetramethylsilane. Other paired resonances can occur for the carbon atoms attached directly to the nitrogen atom and the carbon which carries the hydroxyl group and R3 Again the paired resonances of the more active diastereoisomer of the investigated compounds appear at the higher field position. The present invention provides a process for producing a compound of formula I or a salt, thereof, which process comprises reducing an oxo group and or a double bond and or a moiety reducible to a group R of a compound of formula 11 EMI6.1 wherein R,R3 R and n are as defined in relation to formula I R11 is R4 or a moiety reducible to a group R4 as defined in relation to formula I R12 is a group R2 as defined in relation to formula I or together with R13 forms a bond R13 is hydrogen or benzyl or together with R12 or R14 forms a bond, R14 is hydrogen or together with R15 forms an oxo group 13 or together with R13 forms a bond, R15 is hydrogen or together with R14 forms an oxo group R16 is hydroxyl or together with R17 forms an oxo group R17 is hydrogen or together with R16 forms an oxo group, provided that there is no more than one oxo group and no more than one bond represented by any of R12 to R178 and optionally thereafter forming a salt of the compound of formula I so formed and or converting the compound of formula I so formed into a further compound of formula I . Where there are two or more reducible groups in the compound of formula git these may be reduced separatel.y in any order or simultaneously. The aforementioned reductions may be effected by conventional chemical or catalytic methods, such as chemical reduction using lithium aluminium hydride, sodium cyanoborohydride or sodium borohydride or boron methyl sulphide or by catalytic hydroa,,enation using catalysts such as palladium on charcoal, or platinum, for instance, as platinum oxide. Reduction by sodium borohydride is conveniently effected in a lower alkanolic solvent such as methanol.or ethanol. The reaction is generally carried out at from 0 200C. Reduction by lithium aluminium hydride is conveniently effected in a dry, ether solvent such as diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran at ambient or elevated temperature. Catalytic reduction is conveniently effected in a conventional hydrogenation solvent such as a lower alkanol, for instance ethanol. The hydrogenation is generally carried out under hydrogen gas at about 1 atmosphere pressure to about 10 atmosphere pressure and at ambient or elevated temperature. In particular aspects, the present invention provides processes for producing compounds of formula I by reducing a compound of formula IIA EMI7.1 or reducing a compound of formula lIB EMI8.1 or reducing a compound of formula IIC EMI8.2 or the N benzyl derivative thereof or reducing a compound of formula IID EMI8.3 or reducing a compound of formula lIE EMI8.4 wherein R11 is a moiety reducible to a group R4, and R1, R2, R3 R , R5 and n, are as defined in relation to formula I . Suitable groaps for R11 include cyanoalkoxy or amino carbonylalkoxy groups which may be reduced, for instance catalytically or using lithium aluminium hydride or boron methyl sulphide, to provide the corresponding aminoalkoxy group R4. The present invention also provides another process for producing a compound of formula I or a salt thereof which process comprises reacting a compound of formula III EMI9.1 or a compound of formula VIIID as hereinafter defined with a compound of formula IV EMI9.2 wherein R11 R2, R31 R4 R5 and n are as defined in relation to formula I , and optionally thereafter forming a salt of the compound of formula I so formed. The reaction of a compound of formula III with a compound of formula IV is conveniently effected in a solvent such as a lower alkanol, preferably ethanol. The reaction of a compound of formula VIIID with a compound of formula IV is described below. A particular preferred process for producing compounds of formula I comprises the reduction of a compound of formula IIA , especially using sodium borohydride in methanol at ambient temperature. The present invention also provides yet another process for producing a compound of formula I or a salt EMI10.1 with a compound of formula VI EMI10.2 wherein R1, R21 R31 R , R61 A, X and n are as defined in relation to formula I .and Y is a leaving group, such as halogen especially bromine, or tosyloxy. The reaction of a compound of formula V with a compound of formula VI may be effected in a suitable solvent, which may be aqueous or organic, and preferably but not necessarily at elevated temperature. Compounds of formula I may be converted into further compounds of formula I by conventional processes.Thus, for example, the compound of formula I whereinA and or R6 is hydrogen may be derivatised to produce further compounds of formula I . The salts of compounds of formula I may be produced bytreating the compound of formula I with the appropriate acid. Acyl derivatives of compounds of formula I may be produced by conventional methods. Compounds of formula I and salts thereof, produced by the above processes, may be recovered by conventional methods. Compounds of formula I having a single asymmetric carbon atom may, if desired, be separated into individual enantiomers by conventional means, for example by the use of an optically active acid as a resolving agent.Those compounds of formula I having two asymmetric carbon atoms may be separated into diastereoisomeric pairs of enantiomers by, for example, fractional crystallisation from a suitable solvent such as methanol or ethyl acetate or a mixture thereof. The pair of enantiomers thus obtained may be separated into individual stereoisomers by conventional means such as by the use of an optically active acid as a resolving agent, Suitable optically active acids which may be used as resolving agents are described in 1Topics in Stereochemistry Vol 6, Wiley Interscience, 1971, Allinger, N.L.and Eliel, WL. Eds. Alternatively any enantiomer of a compound of formula I may be obtained by stereospecific synthesis using an optically pure starting material of known configuration. Compounds of formula II may be produced by reacting a compound of formula VII EMI11.1 wherein Rl,R2,R5and n are as defined in relation to formula I , and Rll is as defined in relation to formula II with a compound of formula VIII 3 R Y VIII wherein R3 is as defined in relation to formula Ij and y is a moiety containing a reactive groupwhich is capable of reacting with the amine of formula YII thus forming a compound of formula II , Typical examples of compounds ol formula VIII are EMI12.1 or its hydrate or hemi acetal of a lower alkanol EMI12.2 wherein Z is a halogen atom, preferably bromine EMI12.3 EMI13.1 andEMI13.2 wherein Z is a leaving group such as halogen or preferably tosylate, Conventional conditions suitable for use with the particular compound of formula VIEl may be used for this reaction. Thus the reaction of a compound of formula VIIIA with a compound of formula VII is conveniently conducted at elevated temperature under conditions resulting in the removal of the water formed during the reaction.A particularly suitable method is to perform the reaction in a solvent, such as benzene, under reflux and azeotropically to remove the water using a Dean and Stark trap. The reaction of a compound of formula VIIIB with a compound of formula VII or its N benzyl derivative is conveniently conducted in a polar organic solvent such as acetonitrile or butanone, at an elevated temperature, for instance under reflux. The reaction of a compound of formula VIlIC with a compound of formula VII is conveniently conducted under standard peptide formation reaction conditions. The reaction of a compound of formula III with a compound of formula VII is conveniently conducted in a solvent such as a lower aikanol, preferably ethanol. The reaction of a compound of formula VIVID with a compound of formula VII is conveniently conducted in a solvent such as dimethylsulphoxide at elevated temperatures, preferably about 50 C for about 3 days. When R11 is a group R4 the reaction between a compound of formula III or VIlID and a compound of formula VII give a compound of formula I directly and such processes form a further aspect of the present invention. By using single enantiomers of a compound of formula VII and a compound of formula VIII such as the compounds VIIIC or III wherein R11 is a moiety reducible to a group R4 a stereospecific synthesis of a compound of formula I or II is achieved. The compound of formula II may then be reduced to a compound of formula I without altering the configuration of the two asymmetric carbon atoms. Thus, for example, a compound of formula VII with the R absolute configuration and a compound of formula III with the R absolute configuration would afford a compound of formula I or II with the RRabsolute configuration.Also a compound of formula VII with the R absolute configuration and a compound of formula VIIIC of the R absolute configuration would afford a compound of formula II and by subsequent reduction afford a compound of formula I with an R ,R absolute configuration. Certain compounds of formula, II may also be produced by reacting a compound of formula IX EMI15.1 with a compound of the formula X EMI15.2 or with a compound of formula XI EMI15.3 R1 2 3 5 wherein R1,R2,R3,R and n are as defined in relation to formula I R11 is as defined in relation to formula II and Z is a leaving group,suitably halogen or tosyloxy, preferably tosyloxy. The reaction of a compound of formula IX with a compound of formula X is conveniently effected under conditions which result in the removal of water formed during the reaction. A particularly suitable method is to perform the reaction in a solvent, such as benzene, under reflux and azeotropically to remove the water using a Dean and Stark trap. The reaction of a compound of formula IX with a compound of formula XI is conveniently effected in a solvent such as dimethylsulphoxide at elevated temperature, preferably about 5O C for about two to three days. It is often convenient to prepare the compound of formula II and reduce it to the desired compound of formula I without isolation of the compound of formula it . A compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof hereinafter the drug may be administered as the pure drug, however, it is preferred that the drug be administered as a pharmaceutical composition also comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Accordingly, the present invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or in vivo hydrolysable acyl derivative thereof with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier therefor.

Demonstration of Effectiveness of Compounds I Anti hyperglycaemic activity Female CFLP mice, each weighing approximately 25 g, were fasted for 24 hours prior to the study.The compounds under study were administered orally as an aqueous solution to each of 6 mice. 6 mice were given water as a control. 30 minutes later a blood sample 20 pl was obtained from the tail for the analysis of blood glucose. Immediately after taking this blood sample, glucose 1 g kg body weight was administered subcutaneously to each mouse. Blood samples were then obtained from each mouse at 30 minute intervals for 120 minutes. Compounds that produced a significant P 0.05 reduction of blood glucose, compared with control mice given water, at any time interval, were considered active. The area under the blood glucose curve over the 2 hour period after the adninistration of the glucose was calculated for each compound and compared with the value for control animals.

Female CFLP mice each weighing approximately 24 g, were given food and water ad lib before and during the experiment. The compounds were dissolved in water by addition of one mole of hydrochloric acid per mole of compound and these solutions were acministered orally to each of 12 mice. A further 12 mice were dosed orally with water. The mice were placed in boxes through which air was drawn and the oxygen content of the air leaving the boxes was measured. The energy expenditure of the mice was calculated for 21 hours after dosing from the volume of air leaving the boxes and its oxygen content following the principles described by J B de V Weir,J Physiol London 109, 1 9, 1949 . The food intake of the mice was measured over this same period of 21 hours.The results are express as a percentage of the mean food intake or rate of energy expenditure of the mice dosed with water.

PLATELET AGGREGATION INHIBITION ACTIVITY Collagen induced platelet aggregation in human whole blood in vitro. Collagen added to stirred citrated blood causes platelet aggregation. As the platelets aggregate, the concentration of single platelets falls. Hence the aggregation response can be quantified as a per cent fall in single platelet count. Inhibitors of aggregation, such as aspirin and dipyridamole, reduce the response to collagen V. PLATELET AGGREGATION INHIBITION ACTIVITY Cont Blood drawn from volunteers who denied taking aspirin within the previous seven days was mixed withO.1 vol 129 mM trisodium citrate, dispensed into 0.5 ml aliquots and kept at 250. Collagen Hormon Chemie,Munich or 154 mM NaCl control was added to each aliquot of blood stirred at 1100 rpm in an aggregometer at 37 after 3 mins pre incubation with compound or appropriate solvent.Aggregates were fixed by addition of 0.5 vol 4.5 formaldehyde or 0.05 vol phosphatebuffered glutaraldehyde. Single platelets were counted electronically. Responses, expressed as per cent fall in platelet count, were obtained to a range of collagen concentrations. The concentration producing 50 maximal effect EC50 was estimated from log1O concentrationresponse curves. Dose ratios were calculated by dividing the EC50 obtained in the presence of compound under test by the control EC50. Results are summarised in the table.COMPOUND FINAL CONCENTRATION IN DOSE RATIO WHOLE BLOOD UM . Aspirin 200 2.4 0.3 3 Dipyridamole 200 3.7 1.1 4 Example 24 100 5.9Example 8 100 4.8 VI. ANTI INFLAMMATORY ACTIVITY The method used is based on that described byG. Tonelli et al Endocrinology, 77, 625 634, 1965 . An inflammation is induced iS the rat ear by the application of 50 p1 of a 1 solution of croton oil in tetrahydrofuran, test compounds being dissolved in the irritant vehicle. After 6 hours the inflammation is assessed by killing the animals and weighing the ears. Topical anti inflammatory activity of a compound is generally considered to be shown when a significant 5 level reduction in ear weight is seen compared to nondrug treated control.EMI99.1 COMPOUND SEP OF SEP DOSE SEP ACTIVITY tb EXAMPLE SEP NO.
