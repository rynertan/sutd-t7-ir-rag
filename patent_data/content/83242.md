# Coordinate reading apparatus.

## Abstract
A coordinate reading apparatus comprised of a tablet including magnetic field generating coils a magnetic field detector, responsive to magnetic fields induced by the magnetic field generating coils, for producing an analog electric signal corresponding to a desired position to be read on the tablet, the analog electric signal being composed of both a fundamental wave component signal and n th order harmonic wave component signal n is an integer equal to or larger than 2 and a processing unit for receivig the analog electric signal from the magnetic field detector and for producing coordinate data corresponding to the desired position to be read on the tablet, by using a first rotating magnetic field vector induced by the fundamental wave component signal and a second rotating magnetic field vector induced by the n th order harmonic wave component signal. The phase component of the fundamental wave component signal and also the phase component of the n th order harmonic wave component signal are processed so that the coordinate data can be read by means of the processing unit.
