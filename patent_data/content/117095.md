# Temperature sensors.

## Abstract
In a temperature sensor of the kind comprising a bipolar transistor 1 having an adjustable constant current source 3 connected between its collector and base regions 7 and 9 and its emitter region 11 connected to the output of a high gain amplifier 5 whose input is derived from the current source 3 , the junction between the emitter and base regions 11 and 9 of the transistor is a heterojunction and each of the emitter and base regions 11 and 9 is provided with a metal contact 17 or 19 separated from the associated region by a barrier layer 21 or 23 of an amorphous tantalum iridium alloy. The use of a heterojunction for the transistor emitter base junction increases the temperature range of the sensor whilst the barrier layers ensure metallic stability at the high temperature end of the sensor temperature range.
