## Description
This invention relates to rotavirus, genes, gene segments, cloned genes and segments and products obtained therefrom including diagnostic reagents and vaccines. Rotavirus is now recognized by the World Health Organization as a major cause of infantile gastroenteritis, and a high priority has been placed on control of this disease by the production of a suitable vaccine 1 . Cross neutralization tests indicate four or possibly five 2 4 serotypes of human rotavirus and animal studies appear to show little cross protection between serotypes 5 . Thus a potential vaccine may have to incorporate all the known human serotypes. The virus serotype has recently been shown to be determined by the major outer shell glycoprotein 6 10 a virus surface protein , and the gene segments coding for this protein from a bovine UK and a simian SA11 rotavirus have recently been sequenced 11,12 . To date however, no such gene from human rotavirus has been analyzed. We therefor cloned and sequenced the gene encoding this protein from a human rotavirus. Hu 5 isolated in Melbourne, Australia belonging to serotype 2. Human rotavirus Hu Australia 5 77 was described in detail in Dyall Smith Holmes 1984 , The present invention provides a human rotavirus gene and a cloned human rotavirus gene, the use of such genes to obtain expression of antigenic viral proteins such as in bacterial procaryotic or eucaryotic expression systems and the expression products obtained and further including vaccines and diagnostic reagents obtained therefrom. The present invention also provides the dsRNA gene segment coding for the major outer capsid glycoprotein of a human rotavirus and, without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, that human rotavirus may be Hu Australia 5 77 serotype 2 , a DNA copy of same, a clone thereof, or a vector or a host cell containing same, peptide sequences obtained therefrom. Of particular interest are vectors such as plasmids obtained therefrom and host cells containing same. The present invention also provides a material comprising a nucleotide sequence coding for at least part of the major outer capsid glycoprotein of a rotavirus. In one instance the present invention provides at least one of the nucleotide sequences from nucleotide numbers 291 357, 480 513 and 657 720 of a rotavirus major outer capsid glycoprotein gene. In another instance the present invention provides at least one of the amino acid sequences from amino acid numbers 82 103, 144 155 and 204 224 for which the nucleotide sequences of a rotavirus major outer capsid glycoprotein gene code. In a particularly preferred instance the present invention provides a material comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding, or an amino acid sequence being, Specific portions of cloned genes are provided by this invention and the invention extends to products obtained therefrom including anti sera or anti bodies prepared by utilization of such amino acid sequences. This invention will be exemplified by the following description. The human rotavirus Hu 5 Hu Australia 5 77 13 was grown in MA104 cells and purified as described previously 14 . The procedure for producing cDNA from rotavirus dsRNA, and cloning it into the PstI site of the plasmid pBR322 has been described previously by Dyall Smith Since the UK bovine rotavirus gene encoding the major outer shell glycoprotein gene 8 of this virus had previously been cloned 11 , this was used to screen the Hu 5 clones. To eliminte pBR322 sequences, the UK gene 8 clone was digested with PstI and the insert separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. The insert was then Hu 5 dsRNA was separated on a polyacrylamide gel and immobilized on aminophenylthioether APT paper as described previously 7 , except that the RNA was loaded right along the top of the stacking gel which was not divided into wells . After transfer, the blot was cut lengthwise into strips and hybridized to The pBR322 clone was digested with PstI, and the insert subcloned into the PstI site of M13 mp8 19 . Sequences were determined from the M13 ssDNA template by the chain termination method 20 using exonuclease III treated restriction fragments except the EcoRI TaqI fragment as primers 21 . A synthetic primer 5 dGGTCACAT 3 , complementary to the 3 end of the mRNA sense strand was also used. dsRNA was extracted from purified virus preparations using a simplified version of the method of Herring Reference will be made to the accompanying drawings in which The rotavirus genome consists of eleven dsRNA segments which upon gel electrophoresis form a characteristic pattern of bands the virus electropherotype 24 . The gel patterns of genomic RNA from the human rotavirus Hu 5 Hu Australia 5 77 13 , Wa 25 human, serotype 1 and UK 26 viruses are shown in Fig. 1, and demonstrate clearly that Hu 5 has a short pattern due to the positions of segments 10 and 11 27,14 compared to the long gel patterns of the other two. The short pattern has previously been associated with serotype 2 human rotaviruses 27 29 , and when the Hu 5 virus was serotyped in this laboratory according to the method of Thouless et al. 30 using typing antisera kindly supplied by M. Thouless and Wa, S2 31 and SA11 32 viruses as serotype 1, 2 and 3 reference strains 4,33 it was indeed found to belong to serotype 2 data not shown . Hu 5 genomic dsRNA was converted into DNA and cloned into the PstI site of pBR322 as described previously for UK rotavirus 15 . Clones of the major outer shell glycoprotein were identified using a probe When the predicted amino acid sequence of the Hu 5 virus glycoprotein gene was compared to those of UK and SA11 Fig. 5 an even greater degree of similarity was observed. In pair wise comparison the amino acid sequence homologies are Hu 5 UK 75.8 , Hu 5 SA11 75.2 and UK SA11 85.6 . Studies with UK and SA11 viruses have shown that the glycosylation of these proteins is asparagine linked and consists of simple high mannose oligosaccharide moieties 36 38 . Studies show that all three proteins retain a potential glycosylation site of the type Asn X All glycoproteins of eukaryotic cells require a signal sequence for vectorial transport across the endoplasmic reticulum 39 . Using the general rules proposed by Perlman and Halvorson 40 a typical signal sequence can be discerned in the first 25 residues of the 3 rotavirus glycoproteins. Their putative hydrophobic core sequences res. 6 19 are preceded by the charged residue Glu res. 5 . The likely cleavage sites are after serine at position 15, or after position 25 Ser Thr . Recent studies with SA11 virus 41 have demonstrated a cleaved signal sequence for this protein with a molecular weight 1,500MW consistent with the earlier predicted cleavage site. It is interesting that the first 25 residues of all three glycoproteins show relatively greater conservation than the subsequent 25. While the glycoproteins of Hu 5, UK and SA11 are very similar in amino acid sequence, they must differ in antigenically significant regions since the three viruses are serotypically different, i.e. Hu 5 is a human serotype 2 virus, UK belongs to a bovine serotype 33 , and SA11 although of simian origin is serologically human type 3 33 . Results of competition experiments using monoclonal antibodies to SA11 virus have demonstrated only one or possibly two epitopes involved in neutralization 42 . To locate the major antigenic regions of the glycoprotein we have used monoclonal antibodies which neutralize SA11 rotavirus. By selecting mutants resistant to neutralization and sequencing their glycoprotein genes we were able to identify three A, B and C important regions M.L. Dyall Smith, I. Lazdins, G.W. Tregear and I.H. Holmes, manuscript in preparation for publication . These are amino acids 82 103 The sequence data above support the wealth of serological evidence 43 45 that rotaviruses are a closely related group. Indeed they appear to be much more closely related than the three serotypes of mammalian reovirus, which are structurally and epidemiologically similar to rotaviruses 46 . The genes encoding the serotype specific protein of the three reovirus serotypes are related only to the extent of 1 12 47 . The fact that two simian rotaviruses, SA11 and rhesus MM18006 are serologically closely related 33 yet were isolated over 20 years apart 48,49 also suggests that rotavirus serotypes are fairly stable antigenically, unlike influenza A subtypes which show antigenic drift 50 . While many more rotavirus glycoprotein genes need to be studied, the limited number of human serotypes so far detected and the apparently low level of antigenic drift look encouraging for the development of human rotavirus vaccines. Concerning vaccine preparation, in general it will be best if the rotavirus genetic material of this invention is introduced into a bacterium and this may be effected in accordance with the procedures of Formal et al 51 , Silhavy et al 52 or Roberts et al 53 .

Modifications and adaptations may be made to the above described without departing from the spirit and scope of this invention which includes every novel feature and combination of features disclosed herein.
