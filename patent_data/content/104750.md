# Refrigerant accumulator and charging apparatus and method for vapor compression refrigeration system.

## Abstract
A refrigerant fluid accumulator and charging apparatus for vapor compression refrigeration systems com prising a pressure vessel 24 having an interior liquid vapor separation chamber 26 , a liquid reservoir 28 , a refrigerant inlet conduit 30 , a primary refrigerant vapor outlet conduit 34 and a secondary refrigerant outlet conduit 36 in communication with a sump portion 38 of the reservoir 28 and with the primary outlet conduit 34 . The secondary refrigerant outlet conduit 36 includes a sight glass 40 for observation of the flow of fluid from the sump portion 38 into the compressor suction line. Refrigeration systems may be accurately charged with refrigerant fluid by operating the system at design load conditions with the accumulator and charging apparatus interposed in the refrigerant circuit between the evaporator and the compressor and by venting refrigerant fluid from the system until the flow of fluid through the secondary outlet conduit changes from liquid or mixed phase to substantially the vapor phase.
