## Description
LOGIC CIRCUIT The present invention concerns a differential amplifier circuit formed by a junction type or Schottky barrier gate type field effect transistor MEFET jor. example mounted on an integrated circuit using a gallium arsenide GaAs substrate. In an integrated circuit using a GaAs substrate, it is difficult to form a MOSFET on the substrate since the gate insulation film is not easily deposited, and therefore, junction type or Schottky barrier gate type elements are used as the field effect transistors FET s . That is, in a logic circuit formed by FET s, all transistors in the circuit are formed by junction type or Schottky barrier gate type FET s. However, as explained hereinafter in detail, in a logic circuit formed by junction type or Schottky barrier smote type FET s, the low level output may be unstable. To prevent this unstableness from occurring, a power supply voltage is raised or a constant current or the load is decreased. However, if the former method is used, power consumption is increased, and if the latter method is used, the voltage gain of the circuit is decreased. An embodiment of the present invention can remove unstableness in the low level in the logic circuit formed as mentioned above, to increase the voltage gain, to maintain a low electric power consumption, and to effect a rapid response speed. In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a logic circuit comprising a pair of transistors formed by junction type or Schottky barrier type FET s, a constant current source connected to a common source terminal of the FET s a pair of loads respectively connected between each drain terminal of the FET s and a power supply, and a clamp circuit connected between the drain termi.nals of the FET s. Reference is made, by way of example, to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a diagram of a circuit showing one example of a conventional differential circuit using junction type FET s Fig. 2 is a diagram showing a direct current transfer characteristic in the circuit shown in Fig. 1 Figs. 3A to 3F are diagrams explaining field effect transistors Fig. 4 is a circuit diagram showing one embodiment of the present invention Fig 5 is a circuit diagram showing a modification of the embodiment in Fig. 4 Fig 6 is a diagram showing direct current transfer characteristics in a circuit according to the present invention Fig. 7 is a diagram explaining turn OFF response characteristics Fig. 8 is a diagram of a circuit showing another embodiment of the present invention and Fig. 9 is a diagram of a circuit showing still another embodiment of the present invention. As mentioned previously, in an integrated circuit using a GaAs substrate, it is difficult to form a MOSFET since the gate insulation film is not easily deposited, and thus junction type or Schottky barrier gate type elements are used as the FET s. When a differential amplifier circuit is formed, the circuit can be constituted as shown in Fig. 1. Conventionally, this type of circuit is used when the differential circuit is formed by a bipolar transistor or MOS transistor using a usual silicon Si substrate. However, the characteristic feature of the circuit shown in Fig. 1 is that all the transistors in the circuit may junction type or Schottky barrier type FET s formed on a GaAs substrate. The differential circuit shown in Fig. 1 is formed by a pair of driver FET s Q1 Q2 t with load resistors RL connected to the drains of the FET s Q1 Q1 and a constant current FET Q3 connected to a common source of the FET s Q1 , Q2 In the Figure, VDD is a high power supply voltage, V5s is a low power supply voltage, lo is a constant current flowing in the constant current source, VR is a reference voltage, VIN is an input voltage, and V01 , V02 are complementary output voltages. The FET s Q1 Q3 are all n channel type transistors Q1 Q2 being enhancement or depletion type transistors and Q3 being a depletion type transistor.In the circuit shown in Fig. 1, when the input VIN is sufficiently lower than the reference voltage VR Qi is in an OFF state, and Q2 is in an ON state. In this case, the gate junction of Q2 becomes conductive, and thus the voltage VC at the common source terminal is as shown in the following VC VR Vbi 1 Where, Vbi is a built in voltage of the gate junction.Then, since the constant current 10 flows to the load resistor E in the Q2 side, the output terminal voltage becomes V02 VDD IoRL RL 2 V01 VDD 2 Conyersely, when the input voltage VIN becomes sufficiently higher than the reference voltage VR, Q1 becomes ON and Q2 becomes OFF, and therefore, the following relationships are established VC VIN Vbi 3 V01 VDD Io R 4 02 VDD 4 In this case, for flow of constant current 10 through Q1 t a voltage of about 0.2 volts is required as the voltage VDS ON see Fig. 2 between the drain and source of Q1 as shown below, V01 Vc C VDS ON Therefore, when the input VIN becomes high and the common source voltage VC approaches V01 , V01 is lifted by VIN and the low level becomes unstable. Figure 2 shows a direct current transfer characteristic of the differential amplifier circuit shown inFig. 1. That is, in the region VIN VR , the common source voltage V C increases in accordance with the relationship established in equation 3 , therefore, the low L level output V01 is increased in accordance with the following relationship. V01 C DS ON IN Vbi VDS ON 5 This phenomenon occurs because of the element construction of the FET s, and is explained by Figs. 3A to 3F. Figures 3A and 3B show junction and Schottky barrier gate type FET s hereinafter referred to as junction type FET s , and Fig. 3C shows a MOSFET. The substrate 1 of the junction type FET is formed by GaAs and is insulative, and thus impurities are doped in the source, drain, and channel regions to ensure conductivity. A source electrode S and a drain electrode D are attached to the source drain regions n n , n , and a gate electrode G is attached to the channel region n. In Figs. 3A and 3B, AuGe is used for the electrodes S and D, and WSi is used for the gate electrode G. InFig. 3C, the substrate 2 of the MOSFET is made from Si and is different from the above in that a gate oxide film SiO2 3 is sandwiched between the gate electrode G and the substrate 2. Figure 3D shows a characteristic between the drain source voltage VDS of the junction type FET and the drain current 1D t and Figure 3E shows a characteristic between the drain source voltage VDS of the Schottky barrier type FET and the drain current ID. In Figs. 3D and 3E, the gate voltage is used as the parameter. Figure 3F shows the voltage current characteristic of the gate of the junction type FET. As can be seen in the Figure, when the gate voltage VG is raised higher than the predetermined voltage, a gate junction current flows. This is a normal diode characteristic.The drain current 1D flowing in the FET when in the ON state has the relationship shown below where the current amplification factor is ss, the voltage between gate and source is VGs , and the threshold voltage is Vth ID B VGs Vth In Fig. 1, this ID is a constant current 10 , and V05 VIN V C x therefore, the above mentioned equation becomes 10 VIN V Vth 2 IN Vr is obtained from this equation as follows EMI5.1 Thus, as shown above, V C varies in accordance with the input VIN To deal withthis, 1 the electric source voltageVDD is set high, or O2 the constant current I, or ,that1 tne loaa resistor t is set low, so as Is clear trom equation 4 , the L level of V01 is raised. Thereby, as shown in Fig. 2, Ve in the region in which V IN is higher than VR does not raise the L level of V01.However, the disadvantages of the above are, when method is used, the power dissipation is increased, and when method 2 is used, the voltage gain is decreased. Figure 4 is a circuit diagram showing one embodiment of the present invention, wherein the same elements as shown in Fig. 1 are referred to by the same symbols.This circuit is different from that of Fig. 1 in that a pair of dies D1 , D2 , which are connected in parallel with opposite polarity, are connected between the drains of the driving FET s Q1 t Q2 t that is, between output terminals. In the circuit shown in Fig. 5, theFET s Q4 , Q5 , in each of which the gate is connected to the drain, are used instead of the diodes D1 , D2 of Fig. 4. Figure 6 shows a direct current transfer characteristic, and as shown in the Figure, the L level of the output V01 is not raised. Variation of the common source potential V C for the input voltage VIN is the same as that shown in Fig. 2. The diodes D1 or D2 become conductive when the potential difference between the anode and the cathode becomes large.The potential difference is restricted to Vbi , and the maximum value thereof becomes as follows V01 V02i Vbi 6 The diodes D1 , D2 have the same gate construction as that of the FET s. Therefore, the builtin voltage Vbi becomes the same as shown by equation 1 . When aGaAs MES FET is used, Vbi 0.7 V . 1V01 V02 is equal to V . , that is the output amplitude is restricted by the diodes D, , Dn , whereby L level the low limit is raised, and thus the risingldue to Vs of v01 L level IN can be avoided. The operation of the above circuit will now be explained. When the input voltage VIN is lower than the reference voltage VR , Q1 is OFF and Q2 is made ON, as shown in Fig. 1. However, in the present invention, the diode D is made ON by V01 Vo1 , when. V, i higher by Vbl than Vo2. Therefore, the following relationships are established EMI6.1 Conversely, when VIN VR , Q1 is made ON and is made OFF. Thus, where V01 V02 , the diode D1 is made ON. At this time, the levels of V01 , V02 have an inverse relationship to those given in equations 7 and 8 . Figure 6 shows the relationships between V01V02 , VDD , I0RL 2, and Vbi.Accordingly, a differential amplifier circuit having a symmetrical transfer characteristic and a stable low level can be obtained. As shown in the drawing, the potential difference between the electric source VDD and the middle point of the output is Io RL 2, and thus the voltage gain can be increased by increasing the 10 or . In particular, when 10 is increased, the response characteristic for driving a capacitive load can be increased. Further, the operation can be accelerated in accordance with the amount of the decrease in the output amplitude. A concrete embodiment of the invention will now be explained. In Fig. 4, it is assumed that RL 5 k , VDD 2.5 V, and V55 2.5 V, and the constant of each element is assumed as shown in the following table. In this example, diodes D1, D2 are formed by connecting the source and the drain of an FET so as to form the cathode and the anode the gate electrode is used as the anode electrode . TABLE 1 GATE GATE Vth LENGTH WIDTH Q1 Q2 0.1 V 1 m 40 um Q3 0.6 V 1 um 20 um D1 , D2 0.6 V 1 urn 10 um With these values, as the switching characteristic, the turn ON delay time becomes 0.4 ns, the turn OFF delay time becomes 0.8 ns, and the mean delay time becomes 0.6 ns. When the diodes D1 , D2 are not used as in the prior art , the turn ON delay time becomes 0.7 ns, the turn OFF delay time becomes 1.9 ns and the mean delay time becomes 1.3 ns and thus the response characteristic is inferior. In particular, the length of the turn OFF delay time is due to the fact that the output response is determined by the time constant of the load resistorRL and the capacitive load.In the embodiment, when the input VIN changes from a high E level to an L level, the output V01 increases toward an asymptotic line, as shown by a solid line in Fig. 7. The time constant of this increase is the same as that of he pii art shown by a chain line in the Figure however, X en it reaches the value shown in equation 7, and the diode D2 becomes conductive and is clamped at the level thereof. In the turn ON time, the load capacitance is discharged by the constant current lo flowing in Q1 or Q2 and thus the response is more rapid than that in the turnOFF time. In this embodiment, the output amplitude is about half of the normal amplitude, and therefore, the delay time is short, i.e., is in proportion to the smaller output amplitude. As shown in this embodiment, the present invention has an effect in which the voltage gain is increased and the response speed is accelerated. Further, since an FET in which the drain and the source is short circuited is used as the diode, the manufacturing process is the same as the conventional process. Figure 8 shows another embodiment of the invention in which, instead of a load resistor RL , depletion type FET s Q4 , Q5 wherein the gate and the source are short circuited are used as the load. In this embodiment, a saturation drain current of the loadFET s Q4 , Q5 is set to 1L t the constant current source FET Q3 thereof is set to 10 , and thus the following relationship is established. Io IL 1 2Io The operation is the same as that shown in Fig. 4.When the load resistor RL is replaced by a junction type FET, the better characteristic of the FET can be utilized, and a constant current load which could not be usmq obtained by a MOSFET, which has a characteristic similar to the resistor because of the bias effect of the substrate can be obtained. However, as the constant current source Q3 , which carries the flow of the constant current lo , is used in the common source circuit, when constant current source FET s Q4 , Q5 are used as the load, the operation point cannot be determined. The above mentioned condition 10 1L Io 2 is effected to avoid this state, in which the current value is determined by Q3.Further, the symmetricity of V01 , V02 to VIN is good when 1L Iso 2, but when the value is shifted to the 10 side, this symmetricity is deteriorated, and thus the input sensitivity is deteriorated. Therefore, it is preferable that IL is brought as near to V2 as possible. However, this is difficult to accomplish with the conventional circuit, and when the variation of the characteristic is taken into consideration, 1L mustdiffer from I0 2to some extent.Here, if the diodes D1 , D2 are used, the current flowing in the diode when in an ON state flows into Q3 therefore, IL can be brought near to Io 2. Figure 9 shows a third embodiment of the invention in which the two stage differential circuit shown inFig. 4 is connected in cascade. This embodiment provides an initial stage differential amplifier circuit DA1 which receives an input VIN and a next stage differential amplifier circuit DA2 which extracts the outputs OUT1OUT2. Between these circuits are level shift circuits LS, , LSn in which the initial outputs V01, V are I L least vl shifted by at 2 V to the lower side and are matched to the input level of the next stage. The amplitude bVOUT of the output V01 , V02 is lvol Vo2n.vbi , wherein n is the number of the series connected diode D1 the same as D2 which is used as a clamp.When VDD 3.5 V, V55 2.5 V, VR 0 V, and Vbi 0.7 V, Vth 0.6 V for all FET, then the input VIN has the amplitude of 1.3 X 1.3 V, and the amplitude of the output V01 , V02 becomes 1.5 2 2.9 V V01 and V02 are in reverse phase to each other . The level shift circuit LS1 shifts the level of the input V01 by about 2 V by Vbi 0.7 V x 2 of the diode D3 and the resistance series with the diode, and the output V01, having an amplitude of about 0.5 V 0.9 V is obtained. This is the same as that of the other level shift circuit LS2.The next stage differential amplifier circuit DA2 is operated by two outputs, that is, the outputs V01 , V02 of the level shift circuits LS1 , LS2 are given to Q8 and Qg , which are used as driver FET s, and establish the relationships wherein Q8 is ON and Qg is OFF. Thus it is clear thatVbi is produced between the gate and source of the FET 8 and the potential difference Vth is produced between the gate and the source of the FET Qg. Therefore, as the second stage input voltage, it is sufficient that the relationship VIN 1V011 V02 I Vbi Vth be satisfied.As the level shift circuits LS1 , LS2 do not change the amplitude VOUT EVIN then from the above equation, the relationship n Vbi V . Vth can be introduced. This equation gives rise to the restriction wherein n 1 thus Vth 0 normally OFF , however if the Vth 0 normally OFF FET is used, the relationship may be satisfied when n 2 is used. It is preferable to use the normally OFF type as the transistors Q1 Q2 of the initial stage DA1 of the two stage amplifier circuit, when the relationship to the prior stage is considered. As mentioned above, according to the present invention, the low level output of the differential amplifier circuit used for driving the junction type FET can be stabilized, and since it is not necessary to increase the electric source voltage, it is also not necessary to increase the electric power dissipation.Further, as the amplitude is restricted, rapid operation can be carried out and the advantage of raising the voltage gain can be also obtained.
