## Description
DETAILED LXPLANATION OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a process for producing a novel Ziegler Type supported catalyst component hereinafter merely referred to as catalyst component for the abbreviation except for particularly and expressly stated used for the polymerization of alpha olefins, which has particle sizes abundant in uniformity, an excellent flowability, and in addition a high polymerization activity and production ratio of stereospecific polymers. More particularly, it relates to a process for producing a catalyst component used for the polymerization of olefin, which comprises treating a solid product which is obtained by reacting an organomagnesium compound represented by the general formula R MgX wherein R1 shows a hydrocarbon group having 1 to 20 carbon atoms and X1 shows a halogen atom or a hydrocarbon group having 1 to 20 carbon atoms with a halogenated carbon in the presence of an electron donor compound, with a titanium compound represented by the general formula Ti OA X 1 4 1 wherein A shows an aryl group, X shows a halogen atom and 1 shows a real number of 0 1 4 in the presence of a halogenated carbon. Features of this invention which are to be expressly stated lie not only in that weights of product polymers obtainable from the catalyst component are large based on the unit weight of the catalyst component, that is, the polymerization activity is high but also in that the bulk density of the product polymers and the production ratio of the stereospecific polymers1 in which drawbacks of known Ziegler Type supported catalysts exist, are greatly improved. Furthermore, a feature of tis invention other than the above stated features, which is to be expressly stated, lies in that it makes possible the stereospecific polymerization of a olefins, especially propylene in a high temperature, which has hithertofore been very difficult. In general, it is well known that so called Ziegler Natta catalysts comprising compounds of transition metals Groups IV to VI of the periodic table and organometallic compounds of metals of Groups I to III are used as catalysts for producing stereospecific X olefin polymers. In cases wherein polymers of a olefins such as propylene1 butene 1 and the like are industrially produced, catalyst components containing titanium trichloride as the main component is used as the compounds of the transition metals of Groups IV to VI. These catalyst compounds are such ones resulting from the activation treatment of an eutectic crystals comprising titanium trichloride and aluminum chloride which are obtained by reducing titanium tetrachloride with metallic aluminum, by means of the pulverization and the like or ones resulting from the activation of titanium trichloride by means of the treatment with an organic ether compound and titanium tetrachloride1 which titanium trichloride is obtained by reducing titanium tetrachloride with an organoaluminum compound.It is general to use the catalyst component in a catalyst system in the polymerization of a olefinsX in which the catalyst component is coupled with an organoaluminum compound. However, a olefin polymers produced by the polymerization carried out in the presence of the catalyst system contain catalyst residues in an amount of several hundred ppm and it is necessary to remove the transition metals such as titanium and the like among the catalyst residues remaining in the polymers as far as possible because they promote the degradation of the polymers. Therefore it is the present real situation wherein the catalyst is removed by washing the product polymers with alcohols in a production step of a olefin polymers. Recently, for the purpose of reducing the production cost of a olefins, many catalyst components have been proposed for the purpose that high polymerization activity is attached so as to eliminate the deashing step in which the transition metals such as titanium and the like is removed by washing in the polymerization steps.That is to say, it is aimed to reduce the production cost of a olefin polymers in a way in that if it is possible to attain the amount of the product polymer to a value of one hundred thousand or some hundred thousand weight parts based on the unit weight of the transition metals such as titanium, then the content of the transition metals such as titanium which remain in the product polymers become several ppm or less and therefore the promotion of the degradation of the polymers due to the transition metals reaches a level which could be neglected to make it possible to omit the deashing processing. Most of these catalyst components are Ziegler Type supported catalyst components having as carrier magnesium chloride or magnesium chloride having surface treatment applied by some processes, on which surface titanium chloride is supported. However, in the process for the production of the catalyst components in which magnesium chloride is used as the starting material for the carrier, not only the catalyst components produced by using magnesium chloride but also the polymers have been remarkably inferior to in particle charac teristics such as flowability, because it is necessary to provide with a pulverizing step in which magnesium chloride is pulverized and activated at the same time and further the pulverization gives magnesium chloride in a powder state of crushed pieces lacking the uniformity of particle size as well as ones simultaneously produced in very fine powder state in a large amount. Recently, there are many propositions as to catalyst components improved in the particle characteristics, in which organomagnesium compounds are used as the starting material on the production of the carriers. Typical ones among these propositions are exemplified as follows There are proposed in Japanese unexamined patent application publication No. 123594 1979, a process in that after a complex consisting of an organomagnesium compound and an organoaluminum compound is reacted with tertiary alkyl halide, the resulting product is treated with a carboxylic acid ester and titanium tetrachloride in Japanese unexamined patent application publication No. 133584 1979, a process in which after a solid state product obtained by the reaction of an organomagnesium compound and an organohalide is treated with an electron donor compound, titanium tetrachloride is supported on the product in Japanese unexamined patent application publication No. 76492 1979, a process in which after a reaction product of an organomagnesium compound and a polyhydric alcohol is treated with an electron donor compound, titanium tetrachloride is supported on the product in Japanese unexamined patent application publication Nos. 43094 1978 and 107987 1979, a process in which titanium tetrachloride is supported on a carrier obtained by reacting silicon tetrachloride with a reaction product of an organomagnesium compound and a hydropolysiloxane, or on a carrier obtained by directly reacting silicon tetrachloride with the organomagnesium compound in Japanese unexamined patent application publication No. 58207 1980 a process in which a solid reaction product obtained by reacting an organomagnesium compound with silicon tetrachloride is reacted with an alcohl and a carboxylic acid ester, and then reacted with titanium tetrachloride in Japanese unexamined patent application publication No. 133408 1980 a process in which a solid state organomagnesium compound is treated with an aromatic alcohol and an electron donor compound, and then treated with titanium tetrachloride and in Japanese unexamined patent application publication No. 59914 1982, a process in which a solid state product obtained by reacting an organomagnesium compound with silicon tetrachloride or a halogen containing organoaluminum compound is treated with a titanium compound having a bonding between titanium and phenoxy group as well as a bonding between titanium and a halogen in the presence of an inert solvent. However, these catalyst components and the like have drawbacks in that they may be ones having not so high polymerization activity so as to be able to eliminate the deashing step or ones showing low production ratio as to stereo specific polymers, even though they have high polymerization activity, or they may show high polymerization activity at the first stage of the polymerization with rapid reduction in the polymerization activity or they may give product polymers of low bulk density. Therefore, it seems that they have not yet been actually used. Furthermore, another drawback of known Ziegler Type supported catalyst components lies in polymerization characteristics in high temperature. That is to say, it is necessary for high activity catalyst components to have characteristics capable of sufficiently maintaining their performance on the polymerization of a olefins at high temperature, because the more the catalyst components are high in activity, the more the instantaneous calorific powers are large and accordingly, it may substantially impossible to prevent localized overheatings if it could be possible to effect the overall temperature control within polymerization vessels. On the other hand, research and development as to processes for the gas phase polymerization of a olefins have recently been flourishingly conducted for the purpose of simplifying the polymerization processes of a olefins. This gas phase polymerization is to polymerize a olefins in high temperature, and it is usual in the case of the gas phase polymerization of propylene, for example, to carry out it at a high temperature not less than 900C. The production ratio of stereospecific polymers may be remarkably reduced in the polymerization using known catalyst components at a temperature more than 800C, which is usually carried out at a temperature of 60 to 700C, or at most 800C of the upper limit and therefore, they can not apply to the polymerization of propylene at the high temperature. In addition, it is necessary that the catalyst components, which are used in a process using a fluidized bed as a polymerization apparatus of the gas phase polymerization, should be abundant in the uniformity in particle size but it is difficult to apply to the process a catalyst component produced, for example1 by a process having a co pulverization step because it lacks the uniformity of particle size and has very fine particles in much amount. Accordingly, it has been desired in the field of the gas phase polymerization of a olefins to develop catalyst components which are excellent in the polymerization characteristics in high temperature and abundant in the uniformity of particle size. The inventors have accomplished this invention as a result of extensive research carried out for improving the above stated drawbacks which the above stated Ziegler Type catalyst component supporting titanium have. That is to say, this invention relates to a process for producing a catalyst component used for the polymerization of an a olefin comprising treating a solid product which is obtained by reacting an organomagnesium compound represented by the general formula, RlMgXl wherein R1 shows a hydrocarbon group having 1 to 20 carbon atoms and X1 shows a halogen atom or a hydrocarbon group having 1 to 20 carbon atoms with a halogenated carbon in the presence of an electron donor compound, with a titanium compound represented by the general formula Ti OA lX4 l wherein A shows an aryl group having 6 to 20 carbon atoms, X shows a halogen atom and l shows a real number of O 1 4 in the presence of a halogenated carbon. A feature of this invention on the production of the catalyst component lies in to provide as necessary conditions with that the reaction of the organomagnesium compound and thehalogenated carbon is carried out in the presence of the electron donor compound and that the thus produced solid state product is treated with Ti OA 1X4 1 wherein A shows an aryl group, X shows a halogen atom and 1 shows a real number of O l 4, in the presence of the halogenated carbon. Its advantages, not only lie in that the catalyst component and the polymer are excellent in particle characteristics and are high in the production activity as well as the production ratio of stereospecific polymers but also lie in that it can greatly improve the bulk density of polymers, where known Ziegler Type catalyst components have drawbacks. Further surprising advantages of this invention lie in that it is made possible to conduct the stereospecific polymerization of X olefins in high temperature, for example, the stereospecific polymerization of propylene at a temperature not lower than 90 C, which has been hitherto very difficult, so that it is possible to carry out a stable stereospecific polymerization of a olefinss even when a Ziegler Type supported catalyst is used and in addition, it is made possible to conduct the gas phase polymerization of olefins. This invention is further explained in detail hereinbelow.

Compounds which have not less than two amine nitrogens in molecule, for example1 tetramethyl methylene diamine1 ethylene diamine, tetramethyl ethylene diamine, tetraethyl ethylene diamine and the like can be also used. The used amounts of these electron donor compounds vary depending on the species of the electron donor compounds but are generally not less than 0.001 mol, preferably not less than 0.01 mol, most preferably not less than 0.1 mol based on 1 mol of the organomagnesium compound. The amount less than 0.001 mol gives a low production ratio of the stereospecific polymers and it is difficult to obtain a practical catalyst component.As to the upper limit, there is no specific restriction but it is preferable to use them in an amount not more than 20 mols1 because no specially remarkable effect is obtained by the use of them in an amount more than 20 mols. The organomagnesium compound used in this invention are shown by the general formula RÚMgXÚ, wherein RÚ represents a hydrocarbon group having 1 to 20 carbon atoms and X1 repre sents a halogen atom selected from chlorin, bromine and iodine or a hydrocarbon group or having 1 to 20 carbon atoms.Particularly the following ones can be exemplified diethyl magnesium, di n propyl magnesium, di iso propyl magnesium, di iso amyl magnesium, iso amyl ethyl magnesium, iso amyl n propyl magnesium, di n amyl magnesium, n amyl n propyl magnesium, n butyl n t butyl magnesium, n butyl propyl magnesium, dibutenyl magnesium, di n butyl magnesium, n butyl ethyl magnesium, n butyl sec butyl magnesium, di t butyl magnesium, di sec butyl magnesium, dicyclopentadienyl magnesium, diphenyl magnesium, di n hexyl magnesium, n hexyl ethyl magnesium, bis methyl cyclopentadienyl magnesium, dihexynyl magnesium, dicyclohexyl magnesium, dibenzyl magnesium, bis phenyl ethynyl magnesium, dicinnamyl magnesium, n octyl ethyl magnesium, di n octyl magnesium, di n decyl magnesium, methyl magnesium chloride1 methyl magnesium bromide, methyl magnesium iodide, ethynylene magnesium dibromide, vinyl magnesium chloride, vinyl magnesium bromide, ethyl magnesium chloride1 ethyl magnesium bromide, ethyl magnesium iodide, allyl magnesium chloride, propenyl magnesium bromide1 isopropenyl magnesium bromide, n propyl magnesium chloride, n propyl magnesium bromide1 isopropyl magnesium chloride, isopropyl magnesium bromide, 1 methyl propenyl magnesium bromide, tetramethylene magnesium bromide, t butyl magnesium chloride, n butyl magnesium chloride, sec butyl magnesium chloride, cyclopentadienyl magnesium chloride, cyclopentadienyl magnesium bromide, p phenylene magnesium dibromide, phenyl magnesium chloride, phenyl magnesium bromide, styryl magnesium chloride, styryl magnesium bromide1 l methyl 2,2 diphenylcyclopropyl magnesium bromide, amyl magnesium chloride, hexyl magnesium chloride, benzyl magnesium chloride, octyl magnesium chloride, decyl magnesium chloride and the like Among these organomagnesium compounds, n butyl ethyl magnesium, n hexyl ethyl magnesium, d n hexyl magnesium, n octyl ethyl magnesium, di n butyl magnesium, di n octyl magnesium, ethyl magnesium chloride, n butyl magnesium chloride, n octyl magnesium chloride are especially preferable because of their convenience in using. These organomagnesium compounds are used in this invention after they are solubilized to a solution state by a solvent selected from aliphatic hydrocarbons such as hexane, heptane, a kerosene and the like alicyclic hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane, methyl cyclohexane and the like aromatic hydrocarnons such as benzene, toluene, xylene and the like the above stated organic ether compounds the above stated amines or theirmixtures. Then1 the halogenated carbon used in this invention for obtaining the solid state product is a compound shown by the general formula, CmX2 2m 2 wherein X represents a halogen atom selected from chlorine1 bromine and iodine and m represents an integer of 1 m 10. Particularly, carbon tetrachloride, carbon tetrabromide, carbon tetraiodide, hexachloroethane, hexabromoethane, hexaiodoethane, octachloropropane and the like can be exemplified, among which it is preferable to use carbon tetrachloride or hexachloroethane because of their economic nature, convenience in handling and the performance of catalyst. The organomagnesium compound is admixed with the halo genated carbon to react in the presence of the electron donor compound in this invention. This admixing can be carried out either by adding the halogenated carbon into the organomagnesium compound or the reverse, or by simultaneously adding both the reactants to admix. However, it is desirable on handling the organomagnesium compound to add and admix the halogenated carbon after diluted with a hydrocarbon or without the dilution into the organomagnesium compound dissolved in a solvent, because the organomagnesium compound is generally a viscous substance though it depends on the species and the concentration of the organomagnesium compound. It is preferable that the concentration of the organomagnesium compound in the solvent, which varies depending on the structure of the organomagnesium compound represented by the general formula, RÚMgXÚ and on the number of carbon atoms as well as on the halogen atom, is not more than 50 by weight, preferably not more than 45 by weight and especially not more than 40 by weight. The viscosity of the solvent which has dissolved the organomagnesium compound increases to make the processing such as stirring and the like difficult when the concentration exceeds 50 by weight, because the organomagnesium compound is a viscous substance as stated above. On the other hand, the lower limiting value is not especially restricted but it is desirable to be not less than 0.1 by weight considering the productivity of the catalyst components. By the way, it is desirable to have reacted the organomagnesium compound with the electron donor compound before they are admixed with the halogenated carbon, in a way in that the electron donor compound is added into the solvent which have dissolved the organomagnesium compound or that after the organomagnesium compound is dissolved in the electron donor compound they are diluted with solvent. The halogenated carbon is for substituting the hydrocarbon group or groups with the halogen atom or atoms and it is preferable to use it in an amount of 0.01 to 10 mols, preferably 0.05 to 5 mols and especially 0.1 to 3 mols based on 1 mol of the hydrocarbon group of the organomagnesium compound. The temperature is not especially limitative at the time of the reaction between the organomagnesium compound and the halogenated hydrocarbon but it is desirable to react them at a low temperature, at which the reaction rate does not extremely decreases, because they vigorously react at high temperature. In this view point, it is desirable to carry out the reaction in a range of 50 to 1000C, preferably 30 to 800C and especially preferably 20 to 500C. In addition1 it is preferable, though it depends on the temperature at the time of the reaction, to conduct the stirring and admixing for 0.1 to 10 hours at the temperature of the reaction or after the temperature is elevated from the reaction temperature upto the extent not more than 1500C, in order to complete the reaction. The solid state product obtained by the reaction is separated from the reaction system by the solid liquid separation by means of the decantation, filtration, centrifugal separation and so on. It is preferable to wash the separated solid state product by a hydrocarbon solvent such as hexane, heptane, a kerosene, cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane, benzene, toluene, xylene and the like. The thus separated solid state product is heated to treat with tha titanium compound represented by the general formula Ti OA 1X4 1 , wherein A shown an aryl group, X shows a halogen atom and 1 shows a real number of 0 1 4, in the presence of a halogenated carbon. The halogenated hydrocarbon used in the above heat treatment is one belonging to the class of the halogenated carbon used for obtaining the above stated solid state product. Both the halogenated hydrocarbons may be common or different to through both the steps. This solid state product is suspended in the halogenated carbon in the absence or presence of the hydrocarbon solvent 1 999S by volume and is heated to treat with the titanium compound shown by the above stated general formula, Ti OA 1X411 in the presence of the halogenated carbon at a temperature of 40 to 150 C, preferably 50 to 1500C, and especially preferably 60 to 1500C for 0.1 to 10 hours. It is necessary to use the halogenated carbon in an amount not less than 0.1 mol based on 1 mol of magnesium existing in the solid state product. An amount less than 0.1 mol can not exert the effect due to the halogenated carbon.The upper limit is not especially restricted but it is preferable an amount less than 100 mols. If an amount not less than 100 mols might be used, there is no remarkable effects due to it. The halogen X of the compound represented by the general formula, Ti OA 1X4 1 , which is used in this invention is chlorine, bromine iodine or the like, among which chlorine is especially preferable. As the aryloxy group OA, p methyl phenoxy group, ethyl phenoxy group, isopropylphenoxy group, t butylphenoxy group, phenyl phenoxy group,P naphthoxy group, 5 indanoxy group, p chlorophenoxy group, bromophenoxy groups, phenoxy group, iodophenoxy groups, p methoxy phenoxy group, ethoxy phenoxy groups, phenoxy phenoxy groups and the like are listed. Among them, a p hydrocarbyl phenox group such as p methyl phenoxy group or the like is preferable As to the number 1, the value is of 0 1 4, preferably 0 l 2, more preferably O l z 1 and especially preferably 0.02 1 0.8. The activity of the catalysts and the stereospecificity are improved by leaps and bounds by using such an aryloxy titanium halide compound as compared with a case, wherein it is contacted to react with the corresponding titanium halide or a case, wherein the halogenated titanium is contacted with a carrier which has been contacted to treat with the corresponding phenol. This aryloxytitanium halide compound can be synthesized by known processes. One way is that it can be synthesized by a substitution reaction of between the corresponding titanium compound containing a halogen and the corresponding phenol. When both the compounds are admixed, the reaction proceeds to generally generate a hydrogen halide. It is necessary to substantially complete this substitution reaction in order to be used in this invention. The completion of this reaction can be confirmed by the existence or absence of absorptions due to OH groups in the infra red absorption spectrum of the reaction material. When 0.1 mol of titanium tetrachloride and 0.05 mol of p cresol are admixed at 1200C, for example, HCl gas is vigorously generated and a titanium compound having an average composition of 4 CH3 C6H40 o 5TiC13 5 is obtained. As another way, a reaction material resulting from a disproportionation reaction of an orthotitanic acid ester of the corresponding phenol and the corresponding titanium compound containing a halogen can also be used. When 0.39 mol of titanium tetrachloride and 0.01 mol of titanium tetra p methyl phenolate are admixed, for example1 a titanium compound having an average composition of 4 CH3 C6H40 TC1 9 is obtained. As the titanium compound containing a halogen used in the above synthesis, titanium tetrahalides such as titanium tetrachloride, titanium tetrabromide, halogenated titanates such as methoxy titanium trichloride, ethoxy titanium trichloride and the like can be exemplified but titanium tetrahalides, especially titanium tetrachloride are preferable. The used amount of the aryloxytitanium halide compound is from.1 to 100 ml based on 1 g of the above stated solid state product and especially preferably from 0.5 to 50 ml. After the solid and liquid are separated by the decantation or filtration and further after the aryloxy titanium compound or the like are washed with a hydrocarbon such as hexane1 heptane1 a kerosence, cyclohexane, methyl cyclohexane, benzene, toluene, xylene and the like, the catalyst component can be obtained in a slurry state in the hydrocarbon or in a dry state. The catalyst component obtained by the above processing has particle size abundant in uniformity and is excellent in the flowability. The catalyst component of this invention can be used by coupling with an organoaluminum compound as a catalyst component for the polymerization or copolymerization of a olefins. The organo aluminum compound which can be used by coupling with the catalyst component of this invention, is a compound shown by the general formula, AlR12rX4 wherein R12 shows a hydrocarbon group having carbon number of 1 to 20, X4 shows a halogen atom selected from fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine or hydrogen, r shows a real number of O r 3. Particularly, there can be exemplified trimethyl aluminum, triethyl aluminum, tri n propyl aluminum, tri n butyl aluminum, triisobutyl aluminum1 tri n hexyl aluminum tri 2 methylpentyl aluminum, tri n octyl aluminum, tri n decyl aluminum, diethyl aluminum chloride, di n propylaluminum chloride, diisobutyl aluminum chloride, methyl aluminum sesquichloride, ethyl aluminum sesquichloride, ethyl aluminum dichloride, isobutyl aluminum dichloride, diethyl aluminum fluoride, diethyl aluminum bromide, diethyl aluminum iodide, diethyl aluminum hydride, diisobutyl aluminum hydride, isoprenyl aluminum and the like.These organoaluminum compounds can be used alone or by admixture of at least two species. It is preferable that the used amount of the organo aluminum compound, when it is calculated by converting it into the amount in mol of aluminum contained in the organoaluminum compound is from 1 to 1000 expressed in a ratio of the converted value per 1 mol of the titanium contained in the catalyst component of this invention, which is used in combination with the organoaluminum compound, that is Al Ti. It is possible to allow the coexistence of a known electron donor compound on the polymerization for the purpose of further improving the catalyst performance and the like of the above state combination catalyst. As the known electron donor compound which is allowed to coexist, there can be exemplified the electron donor compound which is used in the production of the above stated catalyst component of this invention. As to the amount of the electron donor compound used on the above stated polymerization, it is used within a range of 0.01 to 3 mols based on 1 mol of the organoaluminum compound used in combination with the catalyst component of this invention, preferably 0.05 to 2 mol and especially 0.1 to 1 mol.

Ti The content of titanium contained in the catalyst component by weight EXAMPLE 1 1 Preparation of Catalyst Component 1 1 Reaction of an Organomagnesium Compound and a Halogenated Carbon n Butyl ethyl magnesium was used as the organomagnesium compound. Into a 300 ml four necked flask provided with a stirrer1 of which interior had been replaced with dry nitrogen, 161 ml of a n heptane solution of n butyl ethyl magnesium concentration being 0.65 mol l, made by Texas Alkyls Corp. was poured.The flask was immersed in a refrigerant and the solution was cooled to OOC. After 2.0 ml of ethyl benzoate was added as the electron donor compound into the solution under stirring, which added amount of the ethyl benzoate corresponded to 0.134 mol based on 1.0 mol of n butyl ethyl magnesium, 25 ml of carbon tetrachloride diluted with 75 ml of n heptane was further added dropwise as the halogenated carbon, which added amount of carbon tetrachloride corresponded to 2.55 mols based on 1.0 mol of n butyl ethyl magnesium. After the addition of carbon tetrachloride the solution was maintained under stirring for 40 minutes at OOC, for 40 minutes at the normal temperature and for 60 minutes at 800C to give a solid product. Then, after the solution was left standing to cool it to the normal temperature the stirring was stopped. After the solid state product was sedimented, the supernatant was extracted by the decantation. After that, 200 ml of n heptane was again poured into the flask and the stirring, sedimentation and the decantation were repeated 5 times to wash the solid state product. 1 2 Synthesis of a Aryloxytitanium Halide Compound After a 200 ml flask provided with a stirrer and a thermometer was replaced with argon, 35.7 ml of titanium tetrachloride and 17.3 ml of p cresol were charged and the temperature was elevated to 1200C. A reaction proceeded with the generation of hydrogen chloride. After the reaction system was maintained at the temperature for 1 hour, 1 ml of the black red colored reaction solution was sampled, of which the infra red absorption spectrum was measured. No absorption due to the stretching vibration of the OH group of p cresol was observed and a liquid state titanium compound represented by the average composition, Ti 0 C6H4 4 CH3 CI3 5 was obtained. 1 3 Treatment with an Aryloxytitanium Halide Compound in the Presence of a Halogenated Carbon The solid state product obtained in the above stated 1 1 was charged into the reaction liquid product obtained in the above stated 1 2 and further 80 ml of CCl4 was added as the halogenated carbon. They are treated under stirring at 800C for 2 hours. After this treatment they are left standing to cool and filtered. After the filtration mass was washed with 1 1 of n heptane, which was then vacuum dryed at 400C for 5 hours to give a catalyst component in an amount of 10 g. The resulting catalyst component consisted of particles abundant in uniformity which had an average particle diameter of 40 T1.

After the internal temperature of the flask was elevated to 70 C, the flask was shaken to agitate and propylene gas was 2 simultaneously introduced up to the pressure of 2 kg cm G to initiate the polymerization of propylene. The polymerization of propylene was carried out for 2.5 hours, while the internal temperature and the internal pressure of the flask were maintained at 70 C and 2 kg cmêG, respectively. After the completion of the polymerization the shaken agitation and the supply of the propylene gas were stopped and after the propylene gas existing in the flask was purged out of the system, a mixture liquid of methyl alcohol and isopropyl alcohol were poured to decompose the catalyst component.
