# Method and apparatus for hole coldworking.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for coldworking of holes using a split mandrel. The apparatus uses a mandrel having radially directed slots to permit contraction of its outer diameter as it is fitted within a hole. The mandrel contains a pilot inside the mandrel. After placing the mandrel and pilot within a hole to be coldworked, the pilot is pushed into the mandrel expanding the mandrel. The pilot and mandrel are then withdrawn through the hole, thereby coldworking the hole.
