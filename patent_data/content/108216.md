# Composite material manufacturing method exothermically reducing metallic oxide in binder by element in matrix metal.

## Abstract
A quantity of reinforcing material is formed into a shaped mass bound together by an inorganic binder. This shaped mass is compounded with a quantity of a molten matrix metal by a pressure casting method. The molten matrix metal includes a quantity of a certain element with a strong tendency to become oxidized, and the inorganic binder includes a metallic oxide which, when brought into contact at high temperature with this certain element, is reduced thereby in an exothermic reaction. During the pressure casting, extra heat is produced as the certain element reduces the metallic oxide, and this aids good penetration of the matrix metal into the interstices of the reinforcing material. The metal remaining from the oxide is dispersed in the matrix metal. This metallic oxide may be silica, zirconia, chromium oxide, yttrium oxide, cerium oxide, ferric oxide, zirconium silicate, antimony oxide, or a mixture thereof and the certain element may be lithium, calcium, magnesium, aluminum, beryllium, titanium, zirconium, or a mixture thereof.
