# Heterocyclically substituted ethanes and their use in liquid crystal materials and devices.

## Abstract
A heterocyclically substituted ethane having a formula R₁ Cy CH₂ CH₂ A R₂ Formula I wherein A represents a heterocyclic ring selected from a trans 2,5 disubstituted 1,3 dioxan ring and a 2,5 disubstituted 1,3 pyrimidine ring R₁ represents an alkyl group having from 1 to 15 carbon atoms and R₂ represents a group selected from hydrogen, alkyl having from 1 to 15 carbon atoms and alkoxy having from 1 to 15 carbon atoms provided that where A is a trans 2,5 disubstituted 1,3 dioxan ring R₂ is alkyl and Cy represents a trans 1,4 disubstituted cyclohexane ring.
