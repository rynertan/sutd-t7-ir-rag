# Removal of alkali metals and alkaline earth metals from molten aluminium.

## Abstract
For removing contaminant alkali and alkaline earth metal contaminants, particularly Li, a particulate aluminium fluoride containing material is introduced into a vortex established in a non cylindrical body of molten aluminium contained in a vessel. The generation of the vortex establishes currents having both downward and lateral components at the bottom of the vortex and upwardly spiralling currents at the periphery of the vessel, which serve to recirculate suspended matter. The stirring of the molten metal is continued until the contaminant level is reduced to a desired level and then the molten Al is separated from the reaction products. The body of metal is contained in a vessel which is non cylindrical and or has its axis inclined to the vertical.

## Description
REMOVAL OF ALKALI METALS AND ALKALINE EARTH METALS FROM MOLTEN ALUMINIUM This invention relates to the removal of contaminant quantities of alkali metals and alkaline earth metals from molten aluminium by reaction with aluminium fluoride. A method of treating molten aluminium with a particulate aluminium fluoride yielding material has been described in our European Patent Application No.82.302448.4. In that method a charge of contaminated metal is placed in a vessel, in which it is stirred to establish a vortex and flow currents having both downward and lateral components at the bottom of the vortex and upwardly spiralling currents at.the periphery of the vessel. The particulate aluminium fluoride yielding material is supplied to enter the vortex and become entrained in the molten aluminium and the stirring of the molten aluminium is continued until the alkali metal and alkaline earth metal content is reduced to a desired low level. The vortex was preferably generated by means of a multi blade impeller having blades inclined to its axis of rotation and in the already described process this was preferably arranged somewhat eccentrically in relation to the axis of a cylindrical vessel having a vertically arranged axis. It was found that optimum results were achieved by careful dimensioning of the impeller in relation to the dimension of the treatment vessel and also to the depth of molten metal to be contained in the vessel, generally a vessel for transferring a body of molten metal from a reduction cell to a casting station. The preferred relations4ips were establshed as follows Relationship Preferred or dimension Outside range Range d D 0.1 0.6 0.15 0.40 h H 0.1 0.7 0.2 0.40 y 0.25E 0.75E 0.411 0.6H 0o 45e 00 400 In the above commat designates the pitch angle of the impeller blades, d is the overall diameter of the bladed portion of the impeller, h is the height of the impeller blades, 9 is the vertical distance from the bottom of the crucible interior to the midpoiat of the impeller blades, H is the vertical distance from the bottom of the crucible interior to the quiescent level of molten metal in, the crucible, D is the internal diameter of the crucible. The impeller was preferably eccentrically located at a distance of 0.1 O. 25D and more preferably at a distance of 0o25 0.7 d in relation to the axis of the vessel. In the method, as described in our saidEuropean Patent Application No. 82,302448.4 the vortex is generated by a stirrer in a mass of molten metal, which is essentially cylindrical in the unstirred condition. It has now been found that the process can be effectively performed on bodies of molten metal which are initially non cylindrical in the non stirred condition .Solid particulate material can be entrained in and reacted with alkali metal contaminants in molten aluminium by generation of a vortex in such non cylindrical masses with similar efficiency to that achieved when the metal is contained in an upright cylindrical crucible, thus permitting the process to be employed in all forms of transfer crucible, particularly crucibles having an essentially continuous, rounded sidewall surface free from recesses or abrupt angles, which would result in locally stagnant zones within the upwardly spiralling molten metal flow in the peripheral region of the vessel. Referring now to the accompanying drawings Figure 1 is a diagrammatic plan view of a crucible having an elliptical cross section. Figure 2 is a similar view of a crucible having parallel sides and semi circular ends. Figure 3 is a view of a crucible having a downwardly tapering interior arranged at a substantial tilt angle in relation to the vertical, with a stirrer rotating about a vertical axis. Pigure 4 is a similar view to Figure 3, but with the stirrer rotating about an axis parallel to the crucible axis. In performing the procesq of the present invention in the crucibles illustrated in Figures 1 4 the stirrer is constructed and arranged to operate in the same way as in our co pending European Patent Application No. 82.302448.4. The stirrer is supported by a lid not shown and a duct is arranged on the lid for the supply of a particulate aluminium fluoride yielding material which expression embraces compounds such as KA124 on to the surface of the molten metal in the vessel. During the treatment of molten aluminium with AlF3 powder, alkali and alkaline earth metals react preferentially with A123 compared to aluminium to form mixed alkali cryolithionite compounds, e.g. Na5A13 14, Na2LiAlF6, and Li3Na3A12F12. These compounds, having a relatively low melting point compared with pure cryo lite , can easily be agglomerated or stick to the crucible walls or float to the melt surface where they react with metal oxide or particles of electrolyte always present after the siphoning of electrolytic cells During subsequent metal transfer from the crucible by siphoning, most of these compounds will remain inside the crucible. As previously stated, according to the present invention, it is possible effectively to treat contaminated molten Al metal with solid particulate AlF3 and maintained in a non cylindrical mass by a crucible or metal confining vessel with a configuration other than cylindrical and or an orientation other than vertical.For example, the vessel may be shaped as shown in Figures 1, 2 and 3, and may be axially tilted with even an axially tilted stirrer Pig. 4 , although a vertical axis of stirrer rotation is preferred because of the effect of gravity on vortex generation. We have found that the preferred dimensional and positional relationships already stated for an upright cylindrical vessel can be more broadly defined with reference to the geometric axis of the vessel, the axis of impeller rotation, and the plane of impeller rotation viz0 the plane, containing the midpoint of the impeller blades, perpendicular to the axis of impeller rotation .Thus, the diameter D is the minimum internal diametrical dimension . measured through the geometric axis of the vessel of the metal containing vessel in the plane of impeller rotation. Blade diameter d and eccentricity x are also measured in the plane of impeller rotation, while blade height h, distance , and distance E are all measured along the axis of impeller rotation, and pitch angle Q is measured with reference to the axis of impeller rotation. With the foregoing definitions, all the relationships and ranges of values i.e. d D, h H, etc. already given, hold true, except for the outside range of eccentricity x. In general, the eccentricity is limited only by the requirement that the minimum distanceC from the axis of impeller rotation to the internal wall of the crucible vessel again measured in the plane of impeller rotation is at least equal to D 4. Figure 1 represents the cross sectional configuration in the plane of impeller rotation of a crucible or vessel 10 having an elliptical cross section containing an axially vertical impeller, or of the surface of a body of molten metal containad in a cylindrical crucible tilted with respect to the impeller axis.In Figure 1 G is the geometric axis of the elliptical crucible, D is the short diameter of the elliptical cross section, and L is the long diameter of the elliptical cross section. The axis of impeller rotation can intersect the plane of impeller rotation viz the plane of the drawing anywhçre within the area enclosed by broken line ellipse E which is spaced inwardly from the crucible wall by a constant distance 0o D 4.In the illustrated eccentric position of the impeller shaft 18, the eccentricity x is clearly greater than D 4, but the axis of impeller rotation is spaced from the crucible wall by a distance Greater than D 4. In Figure 2, the cross sectional configuration of the crucible 10 in the plane of impeller rotation is bathtub shaped, having semicircular ends and straight parallel sides, spaced apart by a distance equal to the diameter of the semi circular ends. The minimum diameterD through the geometric axis G in this plane is the distance between the parallel sides viz. the diameter of the semi circular ends , while the long diameter L is equal to A D, where A is the spacing between the centres of the semi circlea. The broken line E, defining the outer limit of eccentricity of the axis of impeller rotation, is again spaced, inwardly from the crucible wall by a constance distance 0o D 4.The impeller shaft 18 is shown in an illustrative eccentric position within this outer limit, having an eccentricity x. The crucible 10 shown in elevational cross section in Figures 3 and 4 has a geometric axisG tilted with respect to the vertical. In Figure 3 the axis of rotation of the impeller 14 is vertical hence I is a vertical distance from the midpoint of the impeller blades to the point on the crucible floor vertically beneath that midpoint and eccentricity x is measured in the horizontal plane P of impeller rotation, which is at an oblique angle to G. In Figure 4, tyke axis of rotation of the impeller 14 is tilted to the vertical so as to be parallel to G y is again measured along the impeller axis, now at an oblique angle to the vertical, and x is measured in rotational plane P which is perpendicular to G but at an oblique angle to the horizontal.The pitch angle X, aE indicated, is in each case measured with reference to the axis of impeller rotation. In both Figures 3 and 4 the crucible 10 tapers so that its cross sectional diametrical dimensions decrease in a downward direction the value of diameter D which determines the various aforementioned dimensional relationships is, in each instance, measured in the plane P. These different arrangements permitted the removal of Li contamination from Al metal, withdrawn from electrolytic reduction cells, to be achieved within reasonable time, but not in all cases with the same process time as could be achieved with a stirrer eccentrically related to the axis of an upright vertical vessel. It will be appreciated that a mass of molten metal, held in a tilted cylindrical crucible, assumes an essentially non cylindrical shape, having an elliptical surface. The top surface of the body of metal in the tilted, tapering crucible of Pigures 3 and 4 is also ellipsoidal in shape. We have found that a vortex can be generated satisfactorily where the impeller is tilted by an angle of up to 150 to the vertical, but with decreasing efficiency as the tilt angle is increased. It is however preferred that the tilt angle of the impeller should not exceed about 100 to the vertical. The tilting of the axis of the crucible is of less importance.However, increase of the tilt angle of the crucible will decrease its molten metal holding capacity. In all cases however improved results are obtained when the crucible of whatever shape is maintained in an upright condition. It should be noted that the treatment material may comprise aluminium fluoride, possibly containing up to 50 inert material, such as aluminium oxide.Alternatively aluminium fluoride may be added in chemically bound form, such as a fluoaluminate of sodium or potassium. Conveniently it may be added as NaF AlF3 having a low NaF AlF3 ratio by weight, for example 0.6 0.7 1. Aluminium fluoride may also be added admixed with other alkali metal fluorides or chlorides or alkaline earth metal fluorides or chlorides. As an alternative to aluminium fluoride, any active fluorine containing compound could be added, i.e. any such compound which on addition to molten aluminium will liberate a fluoride which is reactive towards alkali or alkaline earth metal contaminants and does not introduce other undesirable contaminants into the molten aluminium. EBBS4 and K22126 are examples of such compounds. All such materials are for convenience in the appended claims considered as being embraced by the terms aluminium fluoride or aluminium fluoride yielding material .
