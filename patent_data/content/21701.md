# Zeolites, a method for their treatment and the use of the treated zeolites.

## Abstract
The present invention provides the following a A fluoride treated zeolite in which the number of equivalents of fluoride exceeds the sum of the numbers of equivalents of all cations except for hydrogen, aluminium and silicon cations in the zeolite. b A process for fluoride treating a zeolite wherein the zeolite is treated with a concentrated aqueous solution of a salt of hydrofluoric acid. c A process for at least partially removing metal ions from an aqueous solution, which comprises contacting the aqueous solution, containing the metal ions, with the fluoride treated zeolite specified in a above or produced as specified in b above. d A process for the chromatographic separation of two or more metal ions in aqueous solution wherein the chromatographic stationary phase comprises the fluoride treated zeolite specified in a above or produced as specified in b above.
