# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR CLEANING WORKPIECES

## Abstract
Workpieces such as sand casted automobile engine blocks are cleaned by advancing a series of such workpieces axially into one end of an elongate barrel that holds the workpieces and rotates or tumbles them in the path of imping ing streams of particles. The workpieces are advanced from one end of the barrel to the other by oscillating the barrel along the longitudinal axis of the barrel. By this technique, workpieces can be advanced through the barrel without the need to push the workpieces against each other, or without the need to provide workpiece engaging and advancing mechanisms.
