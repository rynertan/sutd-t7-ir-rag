# BROADBAND SIGNAL BROADCASTING SYSTEM

## Abstract
Broadband signal broadcasting system comprising a circuit to encode video and audio signals forming a TV channel to be sent to a switching matrix, which is remotely operated by the subscriber Figure 1 a circuit to multiplex two or more TV channels to be simultaneously transmitted on the subscriber s line, which can be a coaxial cable, a radio link or an optical fibre Figure 2 a circuit to receive the signals transmitted on the line, to separate two or more TV channels and to carry out channel decoding by supplying the subscriber s terminals with the corresponding video and audio signals Figure 3 . The system requires a single encoding and a single decoding of the nB n m B type on broadband signals, respectively at the output from signal sources and at the input of subscriber s terminals.
