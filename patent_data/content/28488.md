# Process for bleaching naturally occurring oils and fats.

## Abstract
The oil or fat such as palm oil, coconut oil, sal oil, bay tree leaf oil, rice bran oil and tallow, is treated with a polar bleaching agent, for example, hypochlorite, peroxide, peroxoacid, in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst. The catalyst is preferably cationic and may be a quaternary ammonium compound, for example, tetra n butyl ammonium hydroxide, tetra n octyl ammonium bromide or di hydrogenated tallow alkyl dimethyl ammonium chloride. Oils and fats bleached by this method may be used for soap making.
