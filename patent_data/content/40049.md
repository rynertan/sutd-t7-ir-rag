# Brake system.

## Abstract
A brake system for an off highway vehicle which includes a fluid pressure actuated multi disc brake and a fluid pressure control system. Engagement of the multi disc brake is effected by a fluid operated piston having multiple effective pressure areas. Fluid pressure applied to a certain of the effective pressure areas urges the piston in a brake applying direction fluid pressure applied to the other of the pressure areas urges the piston in a brake releasing direction. The fluid pressure control system controls the communication of pres surized fluid to the effective pressure areas to provide both the brake applying and brake releasing functions. Redundant fluid pressure circuits supply pressurized fluid to the brake applying effective pressure areas. In the event of failure, the control system is operative to interrupt fluid flow to the failed circuit.
