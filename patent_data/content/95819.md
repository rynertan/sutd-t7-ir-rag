# A printing apparatus, particularly adapted to apply a varnish.

## Abstract
This invention relates to an apparatus adapted to apply a layer of viscous sticky material, more particularly varnish, in the form of a pattern or otherwise, to a substrate. The apparatus comprises an applicator roll 1, and an impression roll 2, between which sheets 3 for printing are fed by feed means. The means for applying the varnish to the applicator roll consist of a cylindrical screen stencil 8 with an internal squeegee device 9. The applicator roll is also displaceable so that it can be moved away from the impression roll 2 in the absence of a sheet to be printed in the event of a malfunction in the feed means.
