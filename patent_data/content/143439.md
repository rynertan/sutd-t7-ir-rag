# A high pressure cleaning unit with a bypass valve.

## Abstract
In operating high pressure cleaning units, the outflow of the water discharged from the associated pump 6, 8 may be temporarily interrupted. As the pump normally operates continuously, care must be taken to ensure that the water can then be returned in a bypass to the pump s suction side. This can be achieved by a bypass valve sensing a rising pressure in the said closing situation, thus opening for the bypass. Correspondingly, the bypass valve 36, 44, 32 senses a declining pressure when the discharge or ejection is resumed, thus causing a block to the bypass 40 . How ever, a corresponding, declining pressure occurs when the pump is stopped, for which teason the bypass valve will block the bypass also in this condition. Thus, the result is that during the stopping process determined by the pump s inertia a substantial and dangerous pressure may build up in the discharge conduit 26 from the pump. The invention eliminates this pressure buildup by the bypass valve 36, 44, 32 being designed to respond to a pressure decline with such a time delay via a constriction 60 that the pump with associated motor will be essentially fully stopped after switching off the motor, prior to the bypass being closed. In practice, it is without major significance that a slight delay also occurs in this way when reconnecting full operating pressure when reopening for the discharge from the clean ing unit.
