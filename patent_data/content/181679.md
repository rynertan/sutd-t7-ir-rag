# Pump unit.

## Abstract
A pump unit for sampling air operates at a constant air flow rate in the range of 5 5000 cc min. and employs a filter 2 for removing particles or vapors from the air stream, a air accumulater 3 , a variable drive pump 4 optionally with a bypass 6, 7 , an electric motor 5 for driving the pump 4 , an optional air reservoir 8 , an orifice 11 which creates a pressure drop in the air stream, an optional bypass 9, 10 for the orifice 11 and a pressure switch 12 connected in parallel to the orifice 11 which monitors a change in the air pressure drop. A digital circuit is electrically connected to the pressure switch 12 and a closed loop control means 13 is electrically connected to the digital circuit and the motor 5 . A digital signal determines the open and closed position of the switch 12 and the control means 13 allows current to flow or not flow to the motor 5 driving the air pump 4 to provide a constant flow of air through the unit. The unit can be worn by a worker or placed in a work area and at the termination of a period of time, such as a work day, the filter 2 is removed and the contents collected are analysed by conventional techniques such as gas chromatography to determine a level of exposure of the individual or the level of exposure of people working in that area.
