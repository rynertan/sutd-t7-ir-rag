# Method and apparatus for retaining asepsis of a sterile web of bags.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for retaining asepsis of a sterile web of bags as the web is fed onto the filling pipe of a packaging machine. The filling pipe is enclosed by a sterilizing boot 76 and sterilized by directing a sterilizing agent into the boot. One end of a sealed web of bags 86 , the interior of which is sterile, is then attached to the boot via an interposed absorbent material 82 saturated with a sterilizing medium, such as hydrogen peroxide. Preferably, the filling pipe has a barbed cone 42 attached to its upstream end with which the attached adjacent walls 103, 102 of the boot and web respectively are pierced so that the sterilized pipe is then positioned within the sterile web of bags without destroying the sterile condition of the pipe or the web.
