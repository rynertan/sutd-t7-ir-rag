## Description
Antiviral CompoundsThe present invention relates to antiviral purine derivatives containing an acyclic chain in the 9 position.U.K. Patent Specification No. 1523865 describes a broad class of purine derivatives containing an acyclic side chain in the 9 position. These purine derivatives have been found to have antiviral activity against various classes ofDNA viruses particularly against herpes viruses such as herpes simplex.Among these derivatives, 9 2 hydroxyethoxymethyl guanine otherwise known as acyclovir has been found to have particularly good activity against herpes viruses such as herpes simplex. However, while acyclovir has been found to be especially effective upon topical or parenteral administration, it is only moderately well absorbed upon oral administration with corresponding levels of drug in the plasma. It will be appreciated that when one is treating an internal disorder by oral administration of a drug, it is clearly desirable that the drug should be well absorbed from the gastro intestinal tract with resulting high plasma levels.In UK Patent Specification 2130204 we describe certain purine derivatives which are characterised by the presence of a hydrogen atom in the 6 position of the purine nucleus, and which can be readily converted in vivo by the action of enzymes of the molybdo flavo protein type especially xanthine oxidase dehydrogenase or aldehyde oxidase into the corresponding 6 hydroxy purine derivatives having anti viral activity. Furthermore, from experiments in rats, we have found that oral administration of such 6 hydrogen derivatives results in efficient absorption from the gastro intestinal tract and high plasma levels of the corresponding 6 hydroxy compound, formed by enzymatic conversion of the 6 hydrogen compound.Also, for example, 6 deoxyacyclovir, i.e. 2 amino 9 2 hydroxyethoxymethyl purine, the 6 hydrogen analogue of acyclovir, is also considerably more soluble in water than acyclovir, the former compound having a solubility of 50mg ml and the latter having a solubility of 1.23mg ml at 250C. This improved water solubility enables 6 deoxyacyclovir to be used in a greater variety of aqueous pharmaceutical formulations which require some solubilisation of the drug. The above mentioned class of 6 hydrogen purlne derivatives described in the saidUK Patent Specification may be represented by the general formulaEMI2.1 wherein X is sulphur or oxygen or a chemical bond R1 is halogen, amino or azido R2 is hydrogen, hydroxy, alkyl or hydroxyalkyl R3 is hydrogen or alkyl R4 is hydroxy, hydroxyalkyl, benzyloxy, phosphate or carboxypropionyloxy R5 is hydrogen, alkyl or hydroxyalkyl and esters of those compounds wherein R2 is hydroxy or hydroxyalkyl R4 is hydroxy, hydroxyalkyl or carboxypropionyloxy orR5 is hydroxyalkyl and physiologically acceptable salts of such compounds of formula I and their estersA particularly preferred compound of formula IA is 2 amino.9 2 hydroxy ethoxymeehyl 9H urine. According to the present invention we provide compounds of the general formulaEMI2.2 wherein R1 represents a chlorine atom or an amino group, n is 0 or 1, R2 represents a pentanoyl e.g. pivaloyl , hexanoyl, 2 carboxypropionyl or benzyl group when n is 0, or R2 represents a hydrogen atom or a C16 alkanoyl e.g.acetyl group when n is 1.Such compounds of formula I include the following specific compounds 2 2 amino 9H purin 9 yl methoxy ethyl pivalate 24 2 am ino 9H purin 9 yl me thoxyle thyl n hexanoate 2 2 amino 9H purin 9 yl methoxy ethyl hydrogen succinate 34 2 chloro 9H purin 9 yl methoxyjpropyl acetate 2 amino 9 3 hydroxypropoxymethyl 9H purine 2 amino 9 2 benzyloxyethoxymethyl 9H purineIn addition to the conversion of the 6 hydrogen atom into a 6 hydroxy group by enzymatic action in vivo, as referred to above, the ester compounds of formula I are also converted into the corresponding free alcohols.Thus, when ester compounds of formula I are administered, especially orally, higher blood levels of the corresponding non esterified 6 hydroxy compounds are obtained and maintained for substantially longer periods of time than when the latter compounds are administered directly.The discovery that the 6 hydrogen purines of formula IA referred to above can be readily converted into their corresponding 6 hydroxy analogues was surprising since in previous studies with xanthine oxidase from bovine milk H.Lettre et al 1967 Biochem.Pharmacol., 16, 1747 1755 T.A. Krenitsky et al 1972 Arch.Biophys., 150, 585 599 , it was shown that 9 substitution obliterates or greatly diminishes the rate at which a variety of purines are oxidised. In view of these observations, it was surprising to find that this enzyme oxidised for example 6deoxyacyclovir, a 9 substituted derivative of 2 aminopurine, at a faster rate than the 9 unsubstituted urine, as we have established from enzyme studies.The high level of absorption of the compounds of formula I from the gastrointestinal tract renders the compounds especially useful when oral administration of the compounds is desired, e.g. in the treatment of diseases caused by variousDNA viruses, such as herpes infections for example herpes simplex, varicella or zoster, cytomegalovirus as well as diseases caused by hepatitis B or Epstein Barr virus. The compounds of formula I can also be used for the treatment or prophylaxis of papilloma or wart virus infections. In addition to their use in human medical therapy the compounds of formula I can be administered to other animals for the treatment or prophylaxis of viral diseases, e.g. in other mammals, for example, the treatment of equine rhinopneumonitis.By administration of a compound of formula I or physiologically acceptable salt or ester thereof, especially by the oral route, it is possible to achieve an advantageous effect against such disorders.According to a further feature of the present invention we provide compounds of formula I for use in the treatment or prophylaxis of a viral disease in an animal, e.g. a mammal such as man. The present invention also provides a method for the treatment or prophylaxis of a viral disease in an animal, e.g. a mammal such as man which comprises administering to the animal an effective antiviral amount of a compound of formula I .The compounds of formula I hereafter collectively referred to as the active ingredients may be administered by any route appropriate to the condition to be treated, suitable routes including oral, rectal, nasal, topical including buccal and sublingual , vaginal and parenteral including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, intradermal, intrathecal and epidural . It will be appreciated that the preferred route may vary with for example the condition of the recipient.For each of the above indicated utilities and indications the amount required of an active ingredient as above defined will depend upon a number of factors including the severity of the condition to be treated and the identity of the recipient and will ultimately be at the discretion of the attendant physician or veterinarian. In general however, for each of these utilities and indications, a suitable, effective dose will be in the range 0.1 to 250mg per kilogram bodyweight of recipient per day, preferably in the range 1 to 100mg per kilogram bodyweight per day and most preferably in the range 5 to 20mg per kilogram bodyweight per day an optimum dose is about 10mg per kilogram bodyweight per day. The desired dose is preferably presented as two, three, four or more subdoses administered at appropriate intervals throughout the day.These sub doses may be administered in unit dosage forms, for example, containing 10 to 1000mg, preferably 20 to 500mg and most preferably 100 to 400mg of active ingredient per unit dosage form. While it Is possible for the active ingredients to be administered alone it is preferable to present them as pharmaceutical formulations. The formulations, both for veterinary and for human use, of the present invention comprise at least one active ingredient, as above defined, together with one or more pharmaceutical carriers therefor and optionally other therapeutic ingredients.The carrier s must be acceptable in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof.The formulations include those suitable for oral, rectal, nasal, topical including buccal and sublingual , vaginal or parenteral including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, intradermal, intrathecal and epidural administration. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. Such methods include the step of bringing into association the active ingredient with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients.In general the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product.Formulations of the present invention suitable for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient as a powder or granules as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous liquid or a non aqueous liquid or as an oilin water liquid emulsion or a water in oil liquid emulsion. The active ingredient may also be presented as a bolus, electuary or paste.A tablet may be made by compression or moulding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredient in a free flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, preservative, surface active or dispersing agent. Moulded tablets may be made by moulding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets may optionally be coated or scored and may be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredient therein.Formulations suitable for topical administration to the eye also include eye drops wherein the active ingredient is dissolved or suspended in a suitable carrier, especially an aqueous solvent for the active ingredient. The active ingredient is preferably present in such formulations in a concentration of 0.5 to 20 , advantageously 0.5 to 10 particularly about 1.5 w w.Formulations suitable for topical administration in the mouth include lozenges comprising the active ingredient in a flavoured basis, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth pastilles comprising the active ingredient in an inert basis such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia and mouthwashes comprising the active ingredient in a suitable liquid carrier.Formulations for rectal administration may be presented as a suppository with a suitable base comprising for example cocoa butter or a salicylate. Formulations suitable for nasal administration wherein the carrier is a solid include a coarse powder having a particle size for example in the range 20 to 500 microns which is administered in the manner in which snuff is taken, i.e. by rapid inhalation through the nasal passage from a container of the powder held close up to the nose. Suitable formulations wherein the carrier is a liquid, for administration as for example a nasal spray or as nasal drops, include aqueous or oily solutions of the active ingredient.Formulations suitable for vaginal administration may be presented as pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or spray formulations containing in addition to the active ingredient such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate.Formulations suitable for parenteral administration include aqueous and nonaqueous sterile injection solutions which may contain anti oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient and aqueous and non aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents. The formulations may be presented in unit dose or multi dose containers, for example sealed ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze dried lyophilized condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example water for injections, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets of the kind previously described.Preferred unit dosage formulations are those containing a daily dose or unit daily sub dose, as herein above recited, or an appropriate fraction therof, of an active ingredient.It should be understood that in addition to the ingredients particularly mentioned above the formulations of this invention may include other agents conventional in the art having regard to the type of formulation in question, for example those suitable for oral administration may include flavouring agents.The present invention further provides veterinary compositions comprising at least one active ingredient as above defined together with a veterinary carrier therefor.Veterinary carriers are materials useful for the purpose of administering the composition and may be solid, liquid or gaseous materials which are otherwise inert or acceptable in the veterinary art and are compatible with the active ingredient. These veterinary compositions may be administered orally, parenterally or by any other desired route. For oral administration the compositions can be in the form of a tablet, granule, drench, paste, cachet, capsule or feed supplement. Granules may be made by the well known techniques of wet granulation, precompression or slugging. They can be administered to animals in an inert liquid vehicle so as to form a drench, or in a suspension with water or oil base. Preferably further accessory ingredients such as a dispensing agent are included. These formulations preferably contain from 15 to 85 of the active ingredient.A paste may be formulated by suspending the active ingredient in a liquid diluent. A stiffening or thickening agent may be included together with a wetting agent or a humectant if the liquid diluent is water. If an emulsion paste is needed then one or more surface active agents should desirable in included.From 25 to 80 by weight of these paste formulations may comprise the active ingredient.In feed supplements the active ingredient is generally present in large amounts relative to the accessory ingredients, and the supplements may be added directly or after intermediate blending or dilution. Examples of accessory ingredients for such formulations include solid, orally ingestible carriers such as corn meal, soya flour, wheat shorts, soya grits, edible vegetable materials and fermentation residues. The active ingredient is usually incorporated in one or more of the accessory ingredients and intimately and uniformly dispersed by grinding, tumbling or stirring with conventional apparatus. Formulations containing 1 to 90 by weight of the active ingredient are suitable for adding to feeds. For the treatment of herpes infections in horses, an oral or parenteral dose of from 0.1 to 250mg per kg body weight per day, preferably from 2 to 100mg per kg per day may be required. The dose may be split up into discrete units administered at regular intervals during the day, and repeated daily for up to 14 days or until the infection is cleared. For viral infections in other animals the dose may vary depending on the size and metabolism of the animal. The compositions may be administered in unit dosage form, such as a tablet a few times daily in the amount of 10 to 1000mg per unit dose.The compounds of formula I may be prepared in conventional manner by analogous processes for preparing compounds of similar structure, such as those methods described in U.K. Patent Specifications Nos. 1523865 and 2130204. According to 8 further feature of the present invention we provide a process for preparing compounds of formula I wherein R2 is other than a hydrogen atom or a benzyloxy group which comprises reacting 2 amino 9 2 hydroxyethoxy methflY9Hpurlne with an appropriate esterifying agent., e.g. using the corresponding acid anhydride.Alternative processes for preparing compounds of formula I include a deblocking a corresponding compound substituted in the 2position of the purine nucleus by a blocked amino group b converting a compound of formulaEMI8.1 wherein R2 and n are as defined above, M represents a hydrogen atom or a group or atom convertible into a hydrogen atom and G represents a group or atom convertible into a chlorine atom or an azido or amino group or when M is other than a hydrogen atom G may alternatively represent an amino group into a compound of formula a c reacting a compound of formulaEMI8.2 wherein Q represents a leaving atom or group with a compound of formula ACH2CCH2CH2 CH2 n0R2 wherein n and R2 are as defined above and A represents a leaving group or atom In method a the blocking group may be selected, as appropriate, for example from acyl groups such as C14alkanoyl groups e.g. acetyl or pivaloyl, or aroyl groups, e.g. benzoyl arylmethyl groups e.g. benzyl or tri C14alkylsilyl e.g.trimethylsilyl. Arylmethyl blocking groups, may be removed for example by hydrogenolysis, e.g. by hydrogenation in the presence of Raney nickel or palladium catalyst or by the use of sodium in liquid ammonia. Acyl blocking groups may be removed for example by hydrolysis using for example an amine such as methylamine or triethylamine, advantageously 1Q an aqueous medium.Trialkylsilyl blocking groups may be removed for example by solvolysis e.g. with alcoholic or aqueous ammonia, or by alcoholysis.Conversion of a compound of formula 11 into a comppund of formula I , by method b , can be achieved by various conventional means. For example G may represent an azide group which can be reduced to an amino group by catalytic hydrogenation using a suitable catalyst such as palladium. Alternatively, G may represent a halogen atom or an alkylthio or alkylsulphonyl group Which can be converted to an amino group by aminolysis using for example ammonia. M may represent a halogen e.g. chlorine, atom or a mercapto or thio S e group which can be converted into a hydrogen atom in conventional manner.In the case where M represents a thio group, this conversion may be effected using a compound of formula II in which any amino or hydroxyl groups are optionally blocked by acyl groups, the conversion being effected using a Raney nickel catalyst, e.g in a basic medium which additionally removes the amino and or hydroxy blocking groups in accordance with process a .These processes together with other conventional processes are described inFused Pyrimidines, Part II, Purines Ed. by D. J. Brown 1971 , Wiley Interscience. h process c , the group Q in formula III may for example represent a hydrogen atom an acyl group, e.g. a C1 4alkanoyl group such as an acetyl group or an aroyl group such as a benzoyl group or a tri Cl 4alkylsilyl group such as a trimethylsilyl group. The group A in formula IV may for example represent a halogen atom e.g. chlorine or an acyloxy group wherein the acyl moiety may be for example a C1 4alkanoyl group such as acetyl, or an aroyl group such as benzoyl. The reaction may be conveniently effected in a strong polar solvent such as dimethylformamide or hexamethylphosphoramide, advantageously in the presence of a base such as triethylamine or potassium carbonate.Alternatively, a thermal condensation may be effected by heating the compounds of formulae m and in the presence of a catalytic amount of a strong acid, e.g.sulphuric acid.The starting materials employed in the processes described above may be prepared in conventional manner, e.g. in accordance with the processes described in the above mentioned UK Patent Spedfications 1523665 and 2130204.The following Examples illustrate the present invention Example 1 2 2 Amino 9Hpurin9 fl methoxyethyl pivalate A mixture of 1.92 g 9.15 mM of 2 2 amino 9H purin 9 yl methoxylethanol and 29 ml of dry dimethylformamide was heated on a steam bath until solution occurred, then combined, on cooling to room temperature, with 2.2 ml dry pyridine, 0.34g of 4dimethylaminopyridine and 5.6 ml of pivalic anhydride.
