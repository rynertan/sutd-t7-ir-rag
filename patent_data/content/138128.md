# Blends of poly aryl ketones .

## Abstract
Described herein are blends of at least two separately made crystalline polyarylether resins formed into an inti mate moldable mixture, each resin having, prior to being formed into said mixture i a different crystalline melting temperature and a different glass transition temperature, of ii a different molecular arrangement of unit components each resin comprising 1,4 phenylene units separated by ether oxygen and at least one of said resin containing 1,4 phenylene unit separated by a divalent carbonyl radical.
