## Description
System for the temporary covering over of at least one section of an edifice or buildingThe invention relates to a system for the temporary covering over of at least one section of an edifice or building.From the Dutch Patent Application 8, 102, 685, laid out for public inspection, a system is known which, using a support on the ground and a special supporting structure, is intended for making gables wind en watertight.The object of the invention is to provide a system with which at least one section of an edifice of building can be temporarily covered over so that all the desired operations can be carried out under the said covering.According to the invention such a system for this purpose comprises two beams, placed on top of and along two opposite gable walls for supporting an awning said beames being supported by clamping elements acting on the gable walls and or roofedge structure and connected to pulling members disposed transversely to the beams and exerting a tensile force thereon.The clamping elements can also be provided with mutually perpendicular clamping surfaces acting when both a side surface and an undersurface of a wall. Said pulling members can consist of tiegirders, linked to the clamping elements. They can also consist of pulling cables, the clamping elements being linked to stiff supporting girders to prevent them from tilting.The system according to the invention can not only be used for the covering over of the roof of an already erected building, but can already be mounted on a concrete floor laid at ground level and can be raised as the building activities are progressed. The advantage of the system according to the invention is that use is made of the bearing structure already present in the edifice and it can be mounted on any existing building, the use of a scaffold not being necessary. The system according to the invention can be mounted on the most varied installations, e.g. on swimming baths and similar.Because the activities can be carried out under the awning with protection against weather factors, the quality of the work carried out is better, the percentage of lost hours drops and use can be made of different and cheaper methods of execution since in choosing the methods to be used weather conditions no longer have to be taken into account. In particular, when roof covering operations are being carried out, virtually no limit is placed on the choice of the covering materials because the work is carried out in a protected environment. The beams can form a safety rail and the structure is such that no troublesome obstacles to the carrying out of the operations are present.Preferred embodiments are described in the subclaims.The invention will be explained by reference to the drawing. Figure 1 is a diagrammatic perspective view of the system according to the invention Figure 2 is a side view thereof Figure 3 is a plan view thereof Figure 4 is a side view of a tiegirder with clamping elements used in the system according to the invention Figure 5 is a side view of a clamping element Figure 6 is an end view of a clamping element Figure 7 is a perspective depiction in exploded form of a clamping element Figure 8 is a side view of a clamping element with upright Figure 8a shows a clamping element with two mutually perpendicular clamping surfaces Figure 9 is a plan view of an awning used according to the invention Figure 10 is a side view of the said awning Figure 11 is an end view of the said awning.Figure 12 shows another embodiment of said awning.In figures 1 and 2 the reference numeral 1 indicates the upper part of a building on which operations have to be carried out which must not be disturbed by weather factors, such as the renewal of the roof covering.In order to make this possible, the covering system 1 according to the invention is installed, having two oblong beams 4 or 5 disposed along the gable walls 2 and 3, which beams are supported according to the invention by a number of clamping elements acting on the gable walls. The figure shows four clamping elements 6a 6d acting at the corners of the gable and eight flat clamping elements 7a 7h acting on the long gable.The construction of these clamping elements will be explained in still further detail below they are held pressed against the gable walls and or the roof edge structure with a force such that sufficient friction is present between the clamping elements and the gable walls to carry the whole structure, and to accept all the forces encountered without the risk of gable damage.This pressure force is produced by tie or clamping girders 8a 8e which are present between the beams 4 and 5 and the structure of which will likewise by explained in still further detail. It is noted already at this point that the position of the clamping elements or tie girders on the beams does not necessarily have to coincide.Figure 1 shows an awning 10 which rests on the beams 4 and 5 and is movable in the direction of the arrows lla, llb. Under this awning the work can be carried out independently of weather factors. Although figure 1 only shows one awning, it is of course possible to mount several such awnings as shown in figures 2 and 3 these figures show two awnings 12, 13, which rest on the beams 4, 5 which in this case are supported by a larger number of clamping elements, a few of which are indicated by the reference numeral 7 in figure 2. There is also a larger number of tie girders, a few of which are indicated by 8 . The construction of the beams, tie girders and clamping elements is depicted in more detail in figures 4 to 7 incl. The tie element 8 according to figure 4 consists of two identical truss structures 20, 21 each with end plates 22 or 23 and 24 or 25, the end plates 22 and 25 cf which are linked in a manner still to be described in more detail to the clamping elements and the end plates 23 and 24 are joined to each other on the one hand by the joining rod 26 and on the other hand by two screw rods 27, 28 with mutually opposed pitch and a screw socket 29. Rotating the screw socket places tensions the whole. Any other suitable clamping mechanism can of course be used.Figures 5 and 6 show how a clamping element indicated in its entirety by the reference numeral 7 the construction of wich is shown in more detail in figure 7 is linked to an upright 31 which carries a cruciform linking part 32 at its upper end constructed with a plate 33 linked to the girder 20 and plates 34, 35, to be linked to the beam parts. Figure 7 shows two different beam sectional parts indicated by the reference numeral 4a or 4b. The sectional part is constructed with two upright web sections 37, 38, disposed next to each other at a distance mutually linked at the top and bottom sides by a horizontal I section 39, 40, while the uppermostI section 39 carries an upright I section 41 intended for guiding the awning. The plates 34, 35 fit into the space between the web parts 37 and 38 they are secured by locking pins which are not shown. The sectional part 4b has a simpler construction which will not be described in more detail. The upright 31 carries at the bottom end the short cylindrical bearing arms 43, 44, which fit into semicylindrical recesses in two pairs of adapter pieces 45a, 45b and 46a, 46b. The whole is secured with throughbolts 47 to the pressure blocks 48a, 48b which interact via separating surfaces 49a, 49b with second pressure pieces 50a, 50b and are in addition linked to the latter via dovetail joints 51a, 51b which permit mutual displacement. As figure 7a shows, the separating surfaces 49a, 49b are disposed at an acute angle to the vertical, the surface 49a being oriented anticlockwise, and the surface 49b clockwise.Finally, the pressure pieces 50a, 50b, each carry a pressure plate 52a, 52b lined with a layer of a suitable material with a high coefficient of friction the plates are attached to the pressure pieces by means of the bolts 53.The effect of this construction is that a movement of the upright 31 in the vertical direction, both upwards and downwards, will have the result that one of the pressure pieces 50a or 50b is invariably pressed more firmly against the gable wall. To prevent the other pressure piece being released in these circumstances, a compression spring 54 is accomodated in the dovetail guide which can take the dead weight of the pressure piece concerned and as a result permits assembly from a starting zero position from which an equal displacement in both directions is possible. Figure 7c shows in front view the possible movement of the pressure pieces 50a, 50b, with respect to each other indicated by dotted lines, and figure 7d shows this movement for the pressure piece 50a and the pressure piece 48a interacting therewith in side view.Figure 8 shows a clamping element 7a linked to an upright 31a consisting of a bent rod 70, the bottom end 71 of which is linked in a pivoting manner to the clamping element 7a and the centre of which is pivotably accomodated, around a spindle 72, in side pieces 73 which are linked to the longitudinal girders 74. The top end 75 is linked via the adjustable thrust rod 76 to the side pieces 73 and the girder 74. By slackening the thrust rod 76 the clamping element 7a is to some extent released, as a result of folding aside, from the gable wall 77 and the whole is displaceable along the gable wall.Figure 8a shows a clamping element 80 with two clamping surfaces 81 and 82 acting when respectively the sidesurface 83 and the undersurface 84 of the wall 85. The upright 86 is coupled to the beam 87 which are connected to the tie girder of 88 and said tie girder is also connected to the thrust rod 89 which bears upon the footplate 89a. Figure 9 shows a plan view of the awning 10 provided with regulable ventilation openings 60a 60c and access openings 61a, 61b the awning is built up from the central roof girder 62 and the support girders 63a 63d.The ends of the support girders are joined to sliding pieces 64a 64d which rest on the guide rails 41 mounted on the beams 4 or 5 see figure 7a . Figure 10 shows a side view, and figure 11 an end view of this awning.Many modifications are of course possible within the scope of the invention, in particular in the construction of the beams, tie girders and awning.Figure 12 shows an embodiment in which the clamping elements 901, 90b are tensioned by a cable 91 provided with tensioning means 92 they are prevented from tilting in that they are also connected to a girder 93 of the awning.
