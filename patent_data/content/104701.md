# Apparatus for reading a record carrier.

## Abstract
An apparatus for reading a record carrier R on which digital information I and tracking signals S of compara tively low frequency have been recorded. The apparatus comprises a correction circuit 14 to which the regenerated digital signal is applied, which correction circuit 14 has a transfer characteristic which at least within the frequency band of the tracking signals S corresponds to the transfer characteristic of the chain comprising the recording element K , the record carrier R and the read element K . The correction signal supplied by the correction circuit 14 is subtracted from the signal read and the tracking signals are derived from the signal thus obtained. In this way cross talk components produced in the tracking signals by the digital signal are compensated for.
