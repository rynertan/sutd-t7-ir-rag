# Carrier domain magnetometers.

## Abstract
A carrier domain magnetometer 20 incorporating compensation for changes in its domain rotation frequency magnetic flux density characteristic due to changes in operating conditions, e.g. electric bias and or ambient temperature conditions, and or due to ageing, compensation being obtained by providing means 24 to 28 for monitoring the ratio F F₀ F₀ where F is the domain rotation frequency when both a magnetic field biassing the magnetometer onto the linear part of its frequency flux characteristic and a magnetic field to be sensed are applied, and F₀ is the domain rotation frequency when the biassing field only is applied.
