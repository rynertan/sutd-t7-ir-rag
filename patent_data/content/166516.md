The presence of undesired vegetation causes substantial damage to useful crops. especially agricultural products that satisfy man s basic food needs.such as soybeans. barley, wheat, and the like. The current population explosion and concomitant world food shortage demand improvements in the efficiency of producing these crops. Prevention or minimizing the loss of a portion of valuable crops by killing. or inhibiting the growth of undesired vegetation is one way of improving this efficiency. A wide variety of materials useful for killing, or inhibiting controlling the growth of undesired vegetation is available such materials are commonly referred to as herbicides. The need exists, however, for still more effective herbicides that destroy or retard weeds without causing significant damage to useful crops.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION SYnthesis The following discussion represents a general outline for the preparation of the compounds of this invention. All of the syntheses described below are multistep with one or more methods being taught for each step. This allows for a wide variety of possible synthetic pathways to prepare a particular compound ofFormula I. The proper choice of the synthetic pathway and the best ordering of the reaction sequences for each individual compound will be known to one skilled in the art. The compounds of Formula I can be prepared by one or more of the methods described below inEquations 1 through 5. Reaction conditions are given by way of example only, As shown in Equation 1. many of the compounds ofFormula I where J is J1 J25 J3 and J4, can be prepared by reacting a sulfonylisocyanate W s 0 or, a sulfonylisothiocyanate W w S of Formula II with an appropriate heterocyclic amine of Formula III. R, A and W are as previously defined.Equation 1EMI17.1 The reaction is carried out at 25 to 100eC in an inert, aprotic solvent such as methylene chloride or xylene for 0.5 to 24 hours as taught in U.S. Patent 4.127,405. Many of the compounds of Formula I, where J isJ1 J2 J3 and J4, W is Sand R is H, Ia can be prepared by reacting the appropriate sulfonamide of Formula IV with a heterocyclic isothiocyanate of FormulaV, as shown in Equation 2.Equation 2EMI18.1 The reaction is carried out at 250 to 800C in an inert, aprotic solvent such as acetone or acetonitrile in the presence of a base such as potassium carbonate for 0.5 to 24 hours. The required heterocyclic isothiocyanates V are prepared from the corresponding amines III which would be known to one skilled in the art as taught in EPO Publication 35,893. Many of the compounds of Formula I, where J isJ1 J2 J3 and J4 and W is O Ib . can be prepared by reacting a sulfonylcarbamate of Formula VI with an appropriate amine of Formula III, as shown inEquation 3.Eauation 3EMI18.2 The reaction is carried out at 50 to 1000C in a solvent such as dioxane for 0.5 to 24 hours. The required carbamates VII are prepared by reacting the corresponding sulfonamides IV with diphenylcarbonate in the presence of a strong base. Compounds of Formula Ib can also be prepared. as shown in Equation 4, by reacting a heterocyclic carbamate of Formula VII with an appropriate sulfonamide of Formula IV.Equation 4EMI19.1 The reaction is carried out at 0 to 50 C in a solvent such as acetonitrile or dioxane in the presence of a non nucleophilic base such as DBU for 0.2 to 24 hours. The required phenylcarbamate VII are prepared by reacting the corresponding heterocyclic amines III with diphenylcarbonate or phenylchloroformate in the presence of a strong base. Many of the compounds of Formula Ib where J isJ1 J25 J3 and J4 can be prepared by reacting the sul fonamides of Formula IV with an appropriate methylcarbamate of Formula VIII in the presence of an equimolar amount of trimethylaluminum, as shown inEquation 5.Equation 5EMI19.2 The reaction is carried out at 250 to 400C in a solvent such as methylene chloride for 10 to 96 hours under an inert atmosphere. The required carbamatesVIII are prepared by reacting the corresponding aminesIII with dimethylcarbonate or methyl chloroformate in the presence of a strong base. The intermediate sulfonylisocyanates W I 0 and sulfonylisothiocyanates W S of Formula II fromEquation 1 can be prepared as shown in Equations 6 through 8. As shown in Equation 6. many of the sulfonylisocyanates of Formula IIa where J is J15 J25 J3 andJ4 can be prepared by the reaction of sulfonamides ofFormula IV with phosgene, in the presence of n butylisocyanate and a tertiary amine catalyst. at reflux in a solvent such as xylene by the method of U.S. Patent 4.238,621. Equation 6EMI20.1 The sulfonylisocyanates can also be prepared from the sulfonamides by a two step procedure involving a reacting the sulfonamides with n butylisocyanate in the presence of a base such as K2C03 at reflux in an inert solvent such as 2 butanone forming a n butylsulfonylurea and b reacting this compound with phosgene and a tertiary amine catalyst at reflux in xylene solvent. The method is similar to a procedure taught by Ulrich and Sayigh. Newer Methods of Preparative Organic Chemistry. Vol. VI, p. 223 241. Academic Press, New York and London, W. Foerst Ed. Alternatively, as shown in Equation 7, many of the sulfonylisocyanates of Formula IIa where J is J1J2 J3 and J4 can be prepared by reacting the corresponding sulfonyl chlorides IX with cyanic acid salts.Equation 7EMI21.1 The reaction is carried out at 250 to 1000C in an inert aprotic solvent such as acetonitrile for 0.5 24 hours in the presence of phosphorus pentoxide and an alkali metal salt such as lithium iodide. Many of the sulfonylisothiocyanates of Formula lIb where J is J15 J25 J3 and J4 can be prepared. as shown in Equation 8. by contacting the sulfonamides ofFormula IV with carbon disulfide in the presence of two equivalents of a strong base. The resulting salt is then reacted with phosgene according to the teachings of K. Hartke, Arch. Pharm., 299, 174 1966 .Equation 8EMI21.2 The sulfonamides of Formula IV where J is J1 J2 J3 and J4 of Equations 2. 4, 5, 6 and 8 as well as the other sulfonamides required to prepare the compounds of this invention can be prepared from the corresponding sulfonyl chlorides of Formula Is by contacting with either anhydrous or aqueous ammonia as shown in Equation 9. Equation 9EMI22.1 The preparation of sulfonamides from sulfonyl chlorides is widely reported in the literature. for reviews see F. Hawking and J. S. Lawrence, The Sulfonamides, H. K. Lewis and Co.. London. 1950 and E. H. Northey, The Sulfonamides and Allied Compounds. Reinhold Publishing Corp., New York. 1948. Alternatively. many sulfonamides IV can be prepared by dealkylation of their corresponding N t butyl sulfonamides X as shown in Equation 10.Equation 10EMI22.2 The reaction is carried out by contacting theN t butyl sulfonamide x with a strong acid such as trifluoroacetic acid or methanolic HC1 at 25 to 50 C for 0.5 to 24 hours. The N t butyl sulfonamides x are readily prepared by reacting sulfonylchlorides IX with t butylamine and are useful either as an aid in purification, to enhance solubility for subsequent reactions such as Equation 12 below or to protect the sulfonamide function from competing with reactions at other parts of the molecule. Many of the sulfonamides of Formula IVa can be prepared by functionalization of the correspondingN unsubstituted sulfonamides of Formula IVb as shown in Equation 11. G1 G2 is CHR3 CHR4 n and CH CR4, R isH or C CH3 3 and x is C1, Br. I or other readily displaceable groups. When R is CH3 then n is 0. .3Equation 11 EMI23.1 The reaction is carried out by contacting the sulfonamides IVb with the appropriate electrophile in the presence of a suitable base such as K2CO3 in an inert, polar solvent such as DMF at 0 to 1000C for 0.5 to 24 hours. In some instances the R2 function can also be introduced by Michael addition of IVb to the appropriate Michael acceptor as known to one skilled in the art. While many of the R2 groups can be introduced directly. as described above, some of the R2 groups may best be prepared by standard functional group manipulations upon compounds of Formula IVa containing an appropriate R2 group pecursor as will be known to one skilled in the art. Some examples of these manipulations are the preparation of IVa where R2 contains an epoxide by the epoxidation of IVa where R2 contains a carbon carbon double bond, the preparation of IVa whereR2 contains a sulfone by the oxidation of IVa where R2 contains a thioether function, the preparation of IVa where R2 contains OC O CH3 by acetylation of IVa whereR2 contains OH. or the preparation of IVa where R2 contains NH2 by the reduction of IVa where R contains 2 NO2.This is also the case for many of the R1 substituents which can be prepared by an analogous chemical manipulation known to one skilled in the art. Many of the unsaturated sulfonamides of FormulaIVc can also be prepared from the corresponding saturated sulfonamides of Formula IVd by the two step procedure shown in Equation 12 . G1 G2 is SO2 NR2,CO NR or NR CO, R is H or C CH3 3 and R is H or 4 Equation 12EMI24.1 The first step involves benzylic bromination byN bromosuccinimide to give a monobromide which is subsequently dehydrobrominated in a second step by reaction with a suitable base such as triethyl amine or potassium t butoxide in an inert solvent such as THF. This method has been used to prepare isocoumarins from 3.4 dihydroisocoumarins. see R. Barry,Chem. Rev., 64, 229 1964 . In cases where R1 is an alkyl group. competitive bromination at this site may occur resulting in a mixture.The desired bromide may be separated at this stage, or after treatment with the base. by standard methods. The thiocarbonylsulfonamides of Formula IV whereJ is J5. J6 J7, J85 J9 and J10 and where W1 is S can be prepared from their. corresponding oxygen analogs where W1 is O as represented in Equation 13 using ring system J5 as an example.Equation 13EMI25.1 The reaction is carried out at 1000 to 1400C in a solvent such as xylene for 1.0 to 24 hours as taught by Lawesson, et al. Bull. Chem. Soc. Bela., 87, 229 1978 . The corresponding oxygen carbonyl sulfonamides of ring systems J5, J6, J7, J8, J9 and J10 where W1 is O can be prepared according to the methods described herein and in EP A 107979. EP A 107979 also describes the synthesis of indanone and tetralone sulf amides which can be ketalized by standard methods known to one skilled in the art to give sulfonamides of FormulaIV where J is J ll and J 12. The sulfonyl chlorides of Formula IX of Equations 7 and 9 are important intermediates for the preparation of the compounds of this invention. The syntheses of the required sulfonyl chloride intermediates where J is J1 J2 J3 and J4 are described inEquations 14 through 16. These methods can also be used to prepare the corresponding oxygen carbonyl analogs of ring systems J5 J6, J7 J8. J9 and10 where W1 is O. As shown in Equation 14, many of the sulfonyl chlorides of Formula IX can be prepared from the corresponding amines XI.Equation 14EMI26.1 The reaction involves diazotization of the amineXI with sodium nitrite in HC1, followed by reaction of the diazonium salt with sulfur dioxide and cupric chloride in acetic acid analogous to the teachings ofYale and Sowinski, J. Org. Chem., 25, 1824 1960 . Alternatively, sulfonyl chlorides of Formula IX can be prepared by a modification of the above procedure whereby the diazotization reaction is carried out in dilute sulfuric acid and the resulting diazonium salt is reacted with sulfur dioxide. HC1 and cupric chloride in a cosolvent mixture consisting of acetic acid water 1 1 and an immiscible, inert solvent such as l chlorobutane or methylene chloride at 00 400C for 1 to 24 hours. Many of the sulfonyl chlorides of Formula IX can also be prepared by oxidative chlorination of the corresponding thio compounds of Formula XII as shown in Equation 15. R is H. alkyl, benzyl or carbamoyl, R1 is not SCH3 and J does not contain non aromatic unsaturation. Equation 15EMI27.1 The reaction is carried out by addition of molecular chlorine or a chlorine equivalent to the thio compound in the presence of water at 0 to 800C in an aliphatic carboxylic acid solvent such as acetic acid or an inert organic solvent such as dichloroethane for 1 to 24 hours. Alternatively. many of the sulfonyl chlorides ofFormula IX can be prepared by the two step sequence shown in Equation 16 starting from the thio compoundsXII where R is H XIIa and R1 is not SCH3. Equation 16EMI27.2 The thiol XII R H is contacted with excess hydrogen peroxide in the presence of base to give a sulfonic acid salt which in turn is converted to the desired sulfonyl chloride by contacting with a suitable reagent such as thionyl chloride or phosphorous pentachloride as known to one skilled in the art. Some of the sulfonyl chlorides of Formula IX may best be prepared by direct chlorosulfonation depending on the substitution pattern on the ring and the nature of the substituent as will be known to one skilled in the art. Many of the S arylthiocarbamates of Formula XIIb XII, R CON CH3 2 can be prepared by the NewmanKwart rearrangement starting with the corresponding phenols XIII as shown in Equation 17. Equation 17EMI28.1 The phenol XIII is first reacted with N,N dimethylthiocarbamoyl chloride in the presence of a base. The resulting O aryl N,N dimethylthiocarbamateXIV is then heated at 1500C to 3000C for 2 to 24 hours as taught by Newman and Karnes J. Orq. Chem., 31, 3980 1966 to give the desired S aryl N,N dimethylthiocarbamate XIIb. The related thiols XIIa can be obtained by hydrolysis of the thiocarbamates XIIb. Many of the sulfides of Formula XII where R is alkyl or benzyl can be prepared by reacting a halocompound of Formula XV with an appropriate mercaptan in the presence of a base as shown in Equation 18. R is alkyl or benzyl and X is F, C1 or Br. Equation 18EMI29.1 The reaction is carried out in a solvent such asDMF at 250 to 1500C for 0.5 to 24 hours. The halocompounds XV must not contain functionality which can be attacked by a mercaptide anion as will be known to one skilled in the art. An example of this would be where J is J1 and R2 was a haloalkyl group. These compounds can be prepared from the corresponding sulfides XII where J is J1 R is alkyl or benzyl and R2 is H by standard alkylation methods. Many of the thiocompounds XII of Equation 15 and the chlorocompounds XV X Cl of Equation 18. where J is J1 and n is 0, can be prepared by the reaction sequence shown in Equation 19. G is C1 or S alkyl. R1 does not contain functionality incompatible withBuLi or BH3 and R3 is as previously defined. Equation 19EMI30.1 XII J J1, R alkyl XV J J1, X C1 EMI30.2 EMI30.3 XII J J1, R alkyl XV J J1, X C1 The sequence begins by contacting an appropriately substituted N t butylbenzenesulfonamide XVI with two equivalents of butyl lithium at 0 to 250C in an inert solvent such as THF for 2 to 10 hours to give a dianion according to the teachings of J. Lombardino. J. Org. Chem.. 36, 1843 1971 . The dianion can then be trapped with an ester or, when R3 is H. with dimethylformamide at 780 to 250C to produce, upon aqueous acid workup. the hemiaminal XVII. The hemiaminal XVII can be de t butylated and dehydrated by a catalytic amount of acid such as g toluene sulfonic acid in a solvent such as benzene or toluene at reflux.The resulting benzisothiazole XVII I can be reduced with a reagent such as sodium borohydride in a suitable solvent such s ethanol to produce a 2.3dihydrobenzisothiazole which is N alkylated as described in equation II to give either XII J J15 R alkyl or XV J J15 X C1 by standard methods known to one skilled in the art. Alternatively.hemiaminal XVII may be treated with diborane to produce a t butyl 2,3 dihydrobenzisothiazole tVIIIa. Compounds XII J J15 R alkyl or XV J J1 X Cl are then readily prepared as described previously by treatment of XVIIIa with trifluoroacetic acid followed by N alkylation. If the t butyl group in structuresXVI and XVII is replaced by the appropriate Rz group, the diborane reduction of the hemiaminal gives XII andXV directly. Many of the thio compounds XII of Equation 15 and the chloro compounds XV of Equation 18, where J isJ1 and J4 and n l. can be prepared by the reaction sequence shown in Equation 20. G is C1 or S alkyl, Y is H or CH3, R1 does not contain functionality incompatible with BuLi. R is C CH3 3 or functionality selected from R2 which is compatible with the lithiation conditions shown as will be known to one skilled in the art and R4 is H or C1 C4 alkyl. Equation 20EMI32.1 XII J J1.J45 R alkyl XV J J1 J4 X C1 The reaction is carried out by reacting theN substituted benzenesulfonamides XIX with two equivalents of n BuLi at 780 to 250C in a solvent such as THF for 0.5 to 5 hours. When Y is H, an ortho anion is formed which is trapped with an appropriate epoxide to give the hydroxy sulfonamides XX. When Y is CH3. an ortho methyl anion is produced which is reacted with an aldehyde or DMF to give alcohol XX. The alcohol can be mesylated by reaction of XX with mesyl chloride in the presence of an equivalent of a tertiary amine at 0 to 250C for 1 to 24 hours in a solvent such as methylene chloride.The resulting mesylate is cyclized by heating with a base such as potassium carbonate in a solvent such as DMF to produce the desired compounds XII J J1 J4 R alkyl or XV J J15 J4, X C1 . When R is C CH3 3, contacting with acid as described in Equation 10 will give the corresponding benzisothiazine where R is H. This can be alkylated as described previously for the benzisothiazoles of Equation 19. Many of the thio compounds of Formula XII, whereJ is J6 or Jlo W1 O , can be prepared from the thioethar compounds XXI shown in Equation 21. Y is H or CH3, R1 does not contain Br, R is C2 C4alkyl.

Comm., 1552 1970 . Y is CH3, an ortho methyl anion is produced which is reacted with an aldehyde or slowly enolizable ketones to give the amides XXII as taught by Watanabe et al. TetrahedronLett. 1647 1982 . The amides XXII are saponified by standard methods to the corresponding benzoic acids which readily cyclize upon heating in the presence of acid such as toluenesulfonic acid to give the desired lactones XII J J6 J105 R alkyl .

In some instances, it may be desirable to first protect the amino group as its acetate prior to nitration as is known to one skilled in the art. The desired nitro compound XXV can be isolated by either fractional crystallization or chromatographic procedures and converted to sulfonyl chlorides XXVI by the method previously discussed in Equation 14.The intermediate sulfonyl chlorides XXVI can be converted into their corresponding sulfonamides by reaction with an appropriate amine see Equation 9 and subsequently cyclized a when R is CH2Cl. to the nitro 1,2benzothiazines XXIIIa. where n is 1, by heating in the presence of a base such as potassium carbonate or b when R is H, by contacting the sulfonamide withNBS in a solvent such as carbon tetrachloride to give sulfonamides where R is Br. followed by contacting this product with a base to give the nitro benzisothiazoles XXIa where n is 0. Note the discussion ofEquation 12 for NBS brominations when R1 is alkyl. The procedure of Equation 23 is similar to the method taught by E. Sianesi et al.. Chem. Ber., 104.1880 1971 for the preparation of substituted 1.2benzothiazine l,l dioxides. The starting nitrobenzenes XXII can be prepared by standard methods known to one skilled in the art. Alternatively, as shown in Equation 24, many of the nitro compounds of Formula XXIIIa where n is 1 can be prepared. in part. by contacting the nitro acetamides XXVI I with fuming sulfuric acid according to the method taught by H. Zenno and T. Mizutani. Chem. Abst. 72 79122 1970 for the preparation of 7 nitro l.2 benzothiazine 1.l dioxide. The resulting benzothiazines can be isolated and subsequently alkylated by standard methods known to one skilled in the art.Equation 24EMI36.1 Many of the nitro compounds of Formula XXIIIa where n is 0 can also be prepared from the corresponding l.2 benzisothiazoles XXVI as shown inEquation 25.Equation 25EMI37.1 Nitration of XXVI II gives, in part, the 7 nitro derivative which is isolated by standard methods. The derivative is converted to its l.l dioxide by treatment with hydrogen peroxide.

Quaternization of amino functionality present in the R2 group of compounds of formula I are also useful as herbicides and can be prepared by standard methods known to one skilled in the art. Agriculturally suitable salts of compounds ofFormula I are also useful herbicides and can be prepared in a number of ways known to the art. For example, metal salts can be made by contacting compounds of Formula I with a solution of an alkali or alkaline earth metal salt having a sufficiently basic anion e.g.. hydroxide, alkoxide, carbonate or hydride .Quaternary amine salts can be made by similar techniques. Salts of compounds of Formula I can also be prepared by exchange of one cation for another. Cationic exchange can be effected by direct contacting of an aqueous solution of a salt of a compound of Formula I e.g., alkali metal or quaternary amine salt with a solution containing the cation to be exchanged. This method is most effective when the desired salt containing the exchanged cation is insoluble in water.e.g., a copper salt, and can be separated by filtration. Exchange may also be effected by passing an aqueous solution of a salt of a compound of Formula I e.g.. an alkali metal or quaternary amine salt through a column packed with a cation exchange resin containing the cation to be exchanged. In this method. the cation of the resin is exchanged for that of the original salt and the desired product is eluted from the column. This method is particularly useful when the desired salt is water soluble. e.g., a potassium. sodium or calcium salt. Acid addition salts. useful in this invention.can be obtained by reacting a compound of Formula I with a suitable acid. e.g.. toluenesulfonic acid, trichloroacetic acid or the like.

They include dusts. granules, pellets, solutions, suspensions, emulsions. wettable powders, emulsifiable concentrates and the like. Many of these may be applied directly.Sprayable formulations can be extended in suitable media and used at spray volumes of from a few liters to several hundred liters per hectare. High strength compositions are primarily used as intermediates for further formulation. The formulations, broadly. contain about 0.1 to 99 by weight of active ingredient s and at least one of a about 0.1 to 208 surfactant s and b about 5S to 99 solid or liquid inert diluent s . More specifically, they will contain these ingredients in the following approximate proportions Table VI Weight Percent Active Ingredient Diluent s Surfactant s Wettable Powders 20 90 0 74 1 10Oil Suspensions. 5 50 40 95 0 15 Emulsions.Solutions, including EmulsifiableConcentrates Aqueous Suspension 10 50 40 84 1 20Dusts 1 25 70 99 0 5Granules and Pellets 1 95 5 99 0 15 High Strength 90 99 0 10 0 2Compositions Lower or higher levels of active ingredient can, of course. be present depending on the intended use and the physical properties of the compound. Higher ratios of surfactant to active ingredient are some times desirable, and are achieved by incorporation into the formulation or by tank mixing. Typical solid diluents are described in Watkins, et al., Handbook of Insecticide Dust Diluents andCarriers . 2nd Ed.. Dorland Books, Caldwell, NewJersey. but other solids. either mined or manufactured, may be used. The more absorptive diluents are preferred for wettable powders and the denser ones for dusts. Typical liquid diluents and solvents are described in Marsden, Solvents Guide, 2nd Ed.. Interscience. New York, 1950. Solubility under 0.1 is preferred for suspension concentrates solution concentrates are preferably stable against phase separation at OOC. McCutcheon s Detergents and Emulsifiers Annual, MC Publishing Corp.. Ridgewood, New Jersey.as well as Sisely and Wood, Encyclopedia of SurfaceActive Agents. Chemical Publishing Co., Inc., NewYork. 1964, list surfactants and recommended uses.All formulations can contain minor amounts of additives to reduce foaming, caking. corrosion, microbiological growth. etc. Preferably. ingredients should be approved by the U.S. Environmental ProtectionAgency for the use intended. The methods of making such compositions are well known. Solutions are prepared by simply mixing the ingredients. Fine solid compositions are made by blending and, usually, grinding as in a hammer or fluid energy mill. Suspensions are prepared by wet milling see. for example. Littler. U.S. Patent 3,060.084 . Granules and pellets may be made by spraying the active material upon preformed granular carriers or by agglomeration techniques. See J. E.Browning. Agglomeration , Chemical Engineerina, December 4. 1967, pp. 147ff. and Perryls ChemicalEngineer s Handbook , 4th Ed.. McGraw Hill, New York, 1963, pp. 8 59ff.

Solutions of compounds of Formula I with J J 5 to J 10 should be avoided due to the instability of the compounds when dissolved.Utility The compounds of the present invention are active herbicides. They have utility for broad spectrum pre and or post emergence weed control in areas where complete control of all vegetation is desired, such as around fuel storage tanks. ammunition depots, industrial storage areas. oil well sites. drive in theaters. around billboards. highway and railroad structures. Alternatively, the subject compounds are useful to modify plant growth. Certain of the compounds can be used to control weeds in crops such as wheat.The related compounds where J is J15 n is O, R1 R35H and R2 is isobutyl show excellent control of wild oats both pre and postemergence and are also useful for preemergence and postemergence control of grassy weeds in broadlead crops such as cotton and soybeans. The rates of application for the compounds of the invention are determined by a number of factors, including their use as selective or general herbicides, the crop species involved, the types of weeds to be controlled, weather and climate, formulations selected. mode of application, amount of foliage present, etc. In general terms, the subject compounds should be applied at levels of around 0.01 to 5 kg ha, the lower rates being suggested for use on lighter soils and or those having a low organic matter content, for selective weed control or for situations where only short term persistence is required. The compounds of the invention may be used in combination with any other commercial herbicide examples of which are those of the triazine. triazole, uracil, urea. amide, diphenylether, carbamate and bipyridylium types. The herbicidal properties of the subject compounds were discovered in a number of greenhouse tests. The test procedures and results follow.Test A Seeds of crabgrass Dicitaria sp. , barnyardgrass Echinochloa crusaalli , wild oats Avena fatua , sicklepod Cassia obtusifolia , morningglory IDomoea sp. . cocklebur Xanthium sp. , sorghum, corn. soybean, sugarbeet, rice, wheat and purple nutsedge CvDerus rotundus tubers. and in certain cases, cotton were planted and treated pre emergence with the test chemicals dissolved in a non phytotoxic solvent. At the same time, these crop and weed species, along with cotton and bush bean, were treated post emergence with a soil foliage application. At the time of treatment, the plants ranged in height from 2 to 19 cm.Treated plants and controls were maintained in a greenhouse for sixteen days, after which all species were compared to controls and visually rated for response to treatment. The ratings. summarized in Table A, are based on a numerical scale extending from 0 no injury. to 10 complete kill. The accompanying descriptive symbols have the following meanings C . chlorosis or necrosis E . emergence inhibition G . growth retardation H . formative effects L lodging U a unusual pigmentation X r axillary stimulation and 6Y a abscised buds or flowers. The data show that most of the compounds tested are highly active herbicides with growth modifying properties and that some of the compounds tested provide selective weed control in crops such as wheat, cotton and soybeans. It will be noted that all compounds were tested at the low rate of 50 g ha.
