# Insulating gas for electric device and electric device.

## Abstract
An insulating gas for an electric device is disclosed. It comprises pentafluoropropionitrile or a mixture of penta fluoropropionitrile and sulfur hexafluoride and at least one nitrite ester selected from methyl nitrite, ethyl nitrite, propyl nitrite, butyl nitrite, and amyl nitrite. The effects of pentafluoropropionitrile on humans can be moderated by addition of the nitrite ester.
