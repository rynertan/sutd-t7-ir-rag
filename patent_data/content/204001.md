# DEVICE FOR MEASURING MOVING DISTANCE OF A NUMERICAL CONTROL APPARATUS.

## Abstract
In measuring the moving distance of a numerical control apparatus relying upon a skip function, delay in the detection of skip signal is decreased to measure the moving distance with good precision. Position memory means 24 accumu lates distribution instruction values generated every after a predetermined period, and memory means 13 stores a memory value P
