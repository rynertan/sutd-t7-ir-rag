# Apparatus for determining physical characteristics of plant root samples.

## Abstract
An apparatus for testing a sample of fibres or fila ments including a scanning zone 50 in which said sample is located and scanning means 52 . Transport means is provided for producing relative movement between the scanning zone 50 and the scanning means 52 whereby to define a primary scan path therebetween. The scanning means includes irradiation means 9 arranged to irradiate a portion of the scanning zone, and at least one radiation detector 57 responsive to the irradation whereby to pro vide an output indicating the presence or otherwise of a discrete length of fibre or filament in the portion and pro cessing means for processing the detector output to pro vide a measure of one or more parameters of the sample.
