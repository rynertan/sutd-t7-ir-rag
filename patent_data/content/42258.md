# Ratchet buckle.

## Abstract
A ratchet buckle for tightening and tensioning straps in cludes a bifurcated frame member 11 having a pair of opposi tely positioned parallel arms 12, 13 between which a reel member 14 and ratchet wheels 18 are rotatably mounted. A strap to be tensioned is reeved through the reel member 14 . A bifurcated lever member 32 , having a pair of oppositely po sitioned parallel arms 34, 38 , is rotated on the reel 14 and has a ratchet drive plate 42 which engages the teeth of the ratchet wheel 48 such that when the lever 32 is actuated the reel 14 is rotatably driven. A portion of the load on the frame 11 is transferred to the lever 32 when the buckle is in its closed position, thereby substantially increasing the strength to weight ratio of the device by providing tab members 50, 51 and notches 53, 54 which matingly engage each other with the handle in its tensioned or closed position, one of these two engaging members being on the arms 34, 36 of the lever 32 and the other of these members being on the frame 11 .
