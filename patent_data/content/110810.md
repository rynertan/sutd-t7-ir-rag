# Para nitrodiphenylamine synthesis.

## Abstract
There is disclosed a process for the synthesis of para nitrodiphenylamines wherein the improvement is characteri zed in that a specific co catalyst system is utilized. More spe cifically, a zinc II compound zinc in the plus two oxidation or valence state , is used in conjunction with copper or a copper compound as a co catalyst system in the preparation of para nitrodiphenylamines.
