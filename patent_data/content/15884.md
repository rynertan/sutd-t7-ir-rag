# Apparatus for production of hot water.

## Abstract
An apparatus for production of tap hot water com prising a heat exchanger 1 , connected to a storage tank with hot water, for example a boiler 2 , the primary cir cuit of which is intended to be flowed through by the said hot water and to the secondary circuit of which the cold water is intended to be supplied. A connection in series of the primary circuit and the circulation pump 5 is connected in parallel with a shunt line 6 , in addition to which a thermostat 11 in thermic contact with a con nection 12 in the heat exchanger 1 for the supplied cold water is arranged to control the supply of hot water from the storage tank 2 to the primary circuit in the heat exchanger 1 . The thermostat 11 can be arranged control engagement and disengagement of the circu lation pump 5 . Also installed in a connection point be tween the inlet end of the shunt line 6 and a return line 4 from the heat exchanger to the storage tank is a thermostat controlled regulating valve 7 for regulation of the ratio between the water flow through the shunt line 6 and the returned water flow through the return line 4 to the storage tank 2 .
