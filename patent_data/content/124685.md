# Treating beer to prevent chill haze and metal contamination.

## Abstract
Inorganic chill proofing and other agents that are used to process stable beer often contain metals such as iron and copper that are soluble in beer or other beverages. A small addition of magnesium silicate added to said chill proofing agents, particularly silica hydrogel, substantially averts metal contamination in the beer.
