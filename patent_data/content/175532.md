# Process for the polymerisation of ethylene or the copolymerisation of ethylene and alpha olefins in a fluidised bed in the presence of a chromium based catalyst.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a process for the polymeri sation of ethylene or copolymerisation of ethylene and at least one other alpha olefin, in the gas phase in a fluidised bed reac tor, in the presence of a catalyst comprising chromium com pounds associated with a granular support comprising a refrac tory oxide and activated by thermal treatment, which process is characterised in that the catalyst is used in the form of active particles of prepolymer, obtained by bringing the said catalyst in contact with ethylene, alone, or in a mixture with at least one higher alpha olefin, in such a way that the prepolymer contains from 4 10 ‚Åµ to 3 milligram atoms of chromium in the catalyst per gram.
