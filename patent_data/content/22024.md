# Zeolite agglomerates in a matrix of alkylbenzene sulfonate and polyethylene glycol for detergent formulations.

## Abstract
The present invention deals with zeolite agglomerates in a matrix of alkylbenzene sulfonate and polyethylene glycol for detergent formulations. Zeolite agglomerates which when admixed with conventional laundry detergent formulations remain uniformly distributed and upon contact with hard water rapidly disperse and sequester the hardness cations thereof are comprised of zeolite crystals in a matrix of linear alkylbenzene sulfonate and polyethylene glycol.
