# Optical recording device.

## Abstract
An optical recording device for forming recording tracks of an indented pattern on a magnetic recording tape comprises a rotary drum 21 which has at least two windows 38, 39 , the magnetic recording tape 11 being driven obliquely on the windows along an outer surface of the drum, and an optical system 32 , disposed inside the rotary drum, for converting a modulated laser beam 30 incident on the optical system into two slit beams, major axes of sections of which form a predetermined angle and for emitting the slit beams on the magnetic recording tape through the windows, whereby the recording tracks of the indented pattern in correspondence with the signal are formed obliquely on the magnetic recording tape with respect to a longitudinal direction of the magnetic recording tape by the slit beams so as to form different azimuths between adjacent recording tracks.
