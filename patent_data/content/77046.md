# Lightbulb socket.

## Abstract
A lightbulb socket 1 includes first and second con tact members 25, 26 for electric contact between two conductors 23, 23 and the central and side electrodes 10 and 11 respectively , and means 12 for receiving the base 9 of the bulb 8 , said receiving means being by spring action held in a first position in relation to a shell of the socket when the bulb is unscrewed from the receiving means and being movable to a second position in relation to the shell against said spring action when the bulb is screwed into the receiving means, coupling elements 17, 17 arranged between the conductors and the contact members on one hand breaking the contact therebetween when the receiving means is held in said first position and on the other hand closing the circuit to the bulb when the receiving means is brought to said second position. The same member 17, 17 serving as a coupling element also serves as a spring for moving the receiving means 12 to said first position.
