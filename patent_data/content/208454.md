## Description
FINGERNAIL POLISH CAPSULE This invention relates in general to new and useful improvements in disposable product packages, and more particularly a disposable nail polish cartridge and brush assembly. Nail polish is customarily sold in bottles with the closure cap having attached thereto the brush which is used to apply the polish. The contents of such bottles are much more than that required for a single application of the polish with the result that after an application, the bottle must be reclosed. Women have relied upon various techniques for storing the bottles including placing them in refrigerators. However, there has been no true solution to solvent loss. In fact, there is a solvent loss in the customary nail polish bottle arrangement during storage. This invention relates to a compact cartridge and brush arrangement which may be mounted in a suitable holder and wherein the cartridge contains enough nail polish for a single application. More particularly, the cartridge is sealed so that the loss of solvent before the cartridge is opened is a minimum and a conservative projected shelf life at room temperature would be seven and a half years. With the above and other objects in view that will hereinafter appear, the nature of the invention will be more clearly understood by reference to the following detailed description, the appended claims, and the several views illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Figure 1 is a longitudinal sectional view taken through the nail polish cartridge and brush assembly as distributed and prior to opening. Figure 2 is a sectional view similar to figure 1 but shows the nail polish cartridge mounted within a reusable handpiece and wherein the brush assembly has been shifted relative to the cartridge by the holder to open the cartridge to the brush assembly. Figure 3 is another sectional view similar to figure 2, but shows a plunger associated with the handpiece and the cartridge and being positioned to open the normally closed end of the cartridge and for actuating a piston within the cartridge to force the nail polish from within the cartridge into the brush assembly. Figure 4 is another sectional view similar to Figure 3 which shows the plunger well advanced into the cartridge. Figure 5 is an enlarged exploded perspective view showing the primary components of the brush assembly and the constructional details thereof. Figure 6 is a top perspective view of the piston and shows the details of the seat for receiving the removable end panel of the cartridge. Referring now to the drawings in detail, it will be seen that there is illustrated in Figure 1 a single use, disposable, unit package, with brush formed in accordance with this invention, the package being generally identified by the numeral 10. The package 10 includes a deep drawn cartridge, generally identified by the numeral 12. The cartridge 12 is formed of metal and is somewhat similar to the cartridge of a firearm unit. The cartridge 12 includes a body 14 having an open end 16 and a closed end 18. The closed end 18 is defined by an end panel 20 which has a weakening line 22 formed therein defining a removable panel portion 24. The open end 16 of the cartridge 12 is closed by a plug generally identified by the numeral 26. The plug 26 is also formed of metal and is of a deep drawn construction. The plug 26 includes a cylindrical body 28 having a closed end 30 and an open end 32. The closed end 30 includes an end panel 34 which is joined to the body 28 by a corner 36. The panel 34 has formed on the inner surface thereof a line of weakening 38 which defines a removable panel portion 40. It is to be understood that the body 28 of the plug 26 is of an external diameter such as to be press fitted within the cartridge body 14 in sealed relation. Preferably this seal is enhanced by a radially inwardly directed bead 42 which is formed in the cartridge body 14 and engaged by the corner 36 in a manner to deform the bead 42. The bead 42, in conjunction with the corner 36, also defines means for limiting the telescoping of the plug 26 into the cartridge 12. At the open end 32 of the plug 26, there is a radially outwardly projecting lip 44 which carries a reversely turned portion 46 which, in turn, terminates in a radially inwardly directed flange 48. The lip 44 abuts against the free end of the cartridge body 14 and further serves to limit movement of the plug 26 into the cartridge body 14. The plug 26 carries a brush assembly generally identified by the numeral 50. The brush assembly 50 includes a head or holder 52 and a separately formed brush unit 54. These are best shown in Figure 5. The holder 52 is of a molded plastic construction and includes a tubular piston portion 56 at one end thereof. The piston portion 56 has an end wall 58 and there is projecting from the end wall 58 a tubular ramp 60. A tubular extension 62 extends from the other end of the piston portion 58 with the tubular extension 62 having a bore 64 extending therethrough, the bore 64 also extending through the piston portion 56 and into the ramp 60. The piston portion 56 is provided with circumferentially spaced extensions in the form of guide elements 66. The guide elements 66 are axially elongated in the direction of the tubular extension 62 and have end portions 68 which are of a reduced diameter so as to define shoulders 70 on the fingers. Referring now to figure 1, it will be seen that when the head or holder 52 is assembled with the plug 26, the flange 32 abuts the shoulder 70 and retains the holder 52 within the plug 26. However, the lower portions 68 of the fingers extend out through the open end of the plug 26 for a purpose to be described hereinafter. At this time it is also pointed out that the ramp 60 is disposed adjacent to, but spaced from the end panel 34. The brush portion 54 includes a brush insert which is generally identified by the numeral 71. The brush insert 71 is of a molded plastic construction and includes a rectangular cross sectional upper portion 72 having a generally U shaped relief 74 to define a pair of legs 76. The lower portion 78 of the brush insert 71 is of a circular cross section and has a rectangular cross sectional passage formed therein. The lower portion converges into the rectangular cross sectional upper portion in sloping portions 82 having openings 84 therein which form the upper part of the opening or passage 80. A circle of bristles 86 extend into the bore 80 around the brush insert and project from the holder 52. The cartridge 12 carries a piston which is generally indentified by the numeral 88. As is best shown in Figure 6, the piston 88 is primarily of a hemispherical construction and includes a hemispherical lower part 90. A plurality of guide fingers 92, which are circumferentially spaced, project upwardly and radially outwardly from the hemispherical portion 90 and are integrally formed therewith. The guide fingers 92 terminate in tips 94 which define therebetween a generally cross shaped seat 96. It is to be understood that in the formation of the device, the piston 88 will be first placed within the cartridge 12 followed by a steel ball 100 and thereafter fingernail polish 98 will be placed in the cartridge followed by the insertion of the plug 26. The ball 100 is used to make certain that the polish is well mixed. The ball is positioned within the cartridge 12 as shown. It is intended that the unit be utilized in conjunction with a reusable handpiece which is generally identified by the numeral 104 and is only schematically illustrated. The handpiece 104 comes with a plunger 102 which may be in the form of an elongated rod. As is clearly shown in Figure 1 and previously described, the lower portions 68 of the fingers 66 of the brush holder 52 project through the opening defined by the flange 32. When the unit is placed within the handpiece 104, a lower part 106 of the handpiece engages the ends of the finger lower portions 68 and forces the holder 52 up into the plug 26 to the extent that the ramp 60 forcefully bears against the removable panel portion 40 and displaces the same automatically, as is shown in Figure 2. The interior of the cartridge 12 and the polish 98 disposed therein is now open to the brush attachment 50 for supplying the bristles 86. In order to force the polish out of the cartridge 12, the plunger 102 is now utilized in the manner shown in Figure 3 to bear against the removable panel portion 24 and displace the same axially inwardly as is shown in Figure 3. The displaced removable panel portion 24 engages the seat 96 of the piston 88 and remains seated therein as the piston 88 is forced axially through the cartridge in the manner shown in Figure 4. It is to be noted that the handpiece 104 has an upper portion 108 which functions as a guide for the plunger 102 as is clearly shown in Figure 4. In fact, it is feasible to have a ratchet type interlock between the handpiece 104 and the plunger 102 so as to indicate to a user the amount of movement of the plunger. This would also serve to hold the plunger in its projected position. The handpiece will be designed so as to be conveniently held by a user with there being a balance so that the bristles 86 will have a tendency to be lowermost. After one s nails have been coated in the usual manner, the unit will be displaced from the handpiece and discarded. Although only a preferred embodiment of the invention has been specifically illustrated and described herein, it is to be understood that minor variations may be made in the unit without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.
