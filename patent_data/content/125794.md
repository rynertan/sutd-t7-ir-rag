# DOUBLE RAPPED SIEVE SCREEN DECK

## Abstract
A sieve screen deck for separating liquids from fine solids or for separating solid particles of different sizes, comprising a sieve screen supported on a frame and means to cause the screen to vibrate or flex. The invention is characterised in that the means to cause the sieve screen to vibrate or flex com prises first and second rapping or vibrating means the vibra tional or flexing motion induced in the sieve screen by the second means being substantially greater in amplitude and lower in frequency than the vibrational or flexing motion induced by the first means.
