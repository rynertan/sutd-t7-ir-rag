# Coaxial cable with a connector.

## Abstract
Coaxial cable 1 with a connector which comprises a central contact 23 connected to the central conductor 3 and a sheath contact 11 connected to the conducting sheath 7 . An end portion of the conducting sheath is axially flattened to form a disk and is clamped between a transverse wall 15 of the sheath contact 11 , which wall is provided at the centre with a passage 17 , and a sleeve 19 which is bent inwards at its edge and is arranged coaxially with the transverse wall. As a result, the operation of mounting the connector can be mech anized very simply and readily.
