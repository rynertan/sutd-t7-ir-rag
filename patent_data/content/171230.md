# Diffusion bonding by hot isostatic pressure.

## Abstract
In a method of diffusion bonding a cladding to a substrate the cladding 10 is brought into contact with a substrate 12, op tionally with interposition of a striker 14, and the seam be tween the cladding and the substrate is then sealed by interfer ence fitting a cup shaped isolator 16 over the seam. The entire workpiece is then submerged in a pressure and energy trans mitting medium and subjected to hot isostatic pressing. The isolating means 16 prevents the energy transmitting medium gaining access to the interface between the cladding and the substrate and thus from penetrating between the cladding and the substrate.
