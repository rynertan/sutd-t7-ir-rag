## Description
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Noctuid larvae, named commonly as cutworms, armyworms, loopers, semiloopers, leafworms, borers, and fruitworms represent a serious problem in crops such as corn, cotton, tobacco, rice and many vegetables. Infes station and resulting damage to crops due to these pests vary greatly from year to year depending upon climatic conditions and weather patterns. As such, treatments such as sprays and baits are normally only applied after a dangerous infestation has been identified. Rescue treatments of this type are usually effective. However, in order for this type of treatment to be effective for preventing destruction of seedling stands, an infestation must be discovered early and treated promptly.Black cutworms in particular can be highly destructive to corn, due to their habit of eating the stem of a plant, cutting it down at ground level. Damage from this pest can make it necessary to replant large quantities of corn if not treated promptly and effectively. One insecticidal composition which is commonly used for the control of pests, such as mites, which attack corn, cotton, and many vegetables is phorate O,O diethyl S ethylthio methyl phosphorodithioate . This insecticide is normally applied in granular formulations as a band concurrently with the planting operation. Another insecticidal composition which is used for the control of pests, such as maize billbugs, Southern corn billbugs, cutworms, lesser cornstalk borers, symphylans and nematodes, which attack corn, sugar beets and grain sorghum is terbufos S l,l dimethylethyl thio methyl O,O diethylphosphorodithioate . This insecticide is normally applied in granular formulation as a band at planting. United States Patent 4,199,595 discloses synthetic pyrethroid flucythrinate, cyano 3 phenoxy phenyl methyl 4 difluoromethoxy alpha l methyl ethyl benzeneacetate and its preparation. This insecticide is used for the control of pests, such as cutworms, corn earworms, fall armyworms, European corn borers and aphids. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to insecticidal compositions comprising a mixture of a pyrethroid with 0,0diethyl S ethylthio methyl phosphorodithioate phorate or S l,l dimethylethyl thio methylj O,O diethylphosphorodithioate terbufos , and methods of controlling insect pests and or providing protection from black cutworm infestion and damage. Typical pyrethroids are t a cyano m phenoxy benzyl 2s difluoromethoxy phenyl 1 3 methyl butyrate flucythrinate , cyano 3 phenoxyphenyl methyl 4 chloro a l methylethyl benzeneacetate fenvalerate and cypermethrin. In accordance with the invention, a single application of the insecticidal compositions, at planting time provides effective control of a wide variety of pests and additionally affords protection against black cutworm. This avoids the disadvantages of the prior art treatment since there is no need for rescue follow up.Thus, the present composition avoids the expense connected with rescue treatments. Additionally, it has been found that the present compositions also provide control of Lepidoptera in excess of the expected control attributable to each of the insecticidal components. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS In accordance with the invention, the compositions provided effective control of a wide variety of insect pests, such as cutworms, corn rootworms, wireworms, white grubs, seedcorn maggots, seedcorn beetles, flea beetles, European corn borers, corn leaf aphids and spider mites. It may be applied as granular compositions containing 1 to 25 by weight of phorate or terbufos and a minimum of 0.1 to 2.55 by weight of pyrethroid on sorptive or non sorptive particulate granular particles such as diatomites, clays such as kaoline, attapulgite, montmorillonite, limestone, ground corn cobs, sand silica activated carbon and the like. When non sorptive carriers are used, the surface of the particles may be wetted with the active materials and then coated with finely ground clay, talc, walnut shell flour, or other inert material. A binder or sticking agent may also be added to assure the adherence of the active material to the particles. In the case of sorptive carriers such as clays, the clay particles are treated with a polyol deactivator such as an alkylene glycol, diethylene glycol, propylene glycol, triethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, and the like About 1 to 20X by weight of the deactivator is used to avoid stability problems. The results obtained by varying the ratios of the components of the instant compositions are shown inTable I. It can be seen that compositions containing 10 1 to 40 1 weight ratios of phorate or terbufos to flucythrinate are useful. For application under growing conditions normal application rates as a broadcast application for phorate and terbufos are in the 1.0 to 3.0 lb acre range and preferred compositions of the invention would provide a minimum of from 0.01 to .09 lbs acre of flucythrinate on a broadcast basis. However, it should be recognized that under varying insect pressure and climatic conditions actual rates of application may vary while maintaining 10 1 to 40 1 weight ratio of the components.

In practice, granular compositions of this type are frequently applied as banded treatments over the rows of planted crops and are frequently expressed in terms of ounces per 1,000 feet of row. Thus, this type of application can result in varying expressions of concentration of materials in localized areas depending upon the spacing of the crops. Expression of application rates on a broadcast basis readily enables conversion to other application practices. In order to demonstrate the present invention, the following examples are given primarily as an illustration. No specific details or enumerations contained therein should be construed as limitations on the present invention except insofas as they appear in the appended claims. All parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise specifically designated. EXAMPLE 1Preparation of granular compositions The general procedures for the preparation of granular pesticidal compositions of the invention. Method A The desired quantity of granules is charged into a suitable pill coater apparatus modified by the addition of aluminum blades to facilitate the mixing and the flow of clay particles through the spray stream. The required amount of each toxicant and deactivator, if desired is placed in a stainless steel sprayer adapted so that a nozzle, screen and tip can be used. The container is pressurized to 1.75 kg cm2. The pill coater is started and the toxicant spray stream directed down and into the flowing granules. The sprayer is shaken at intervals to insure a homogeneous spray solution. After the contents have been sprayed, the container is rinsed with a small amount of methylene chloride and spray rinsed onto the granules, and the granules dried by evaporating the methylene chloride. Method B The desired quantity of granules is charged into a hexagonal polyethylene bowl attached to a variable speed laboratory mixer. The speed of the mixer is adjusted so that the granules cascade down the side of the bowl. The toxicant s and deactivator are placed in a 40 mL capacity DeVilbis bottle. A DeVilbis nozzle is attached to the bottle, the air pressure is adjusted to 0.14 to 0.21 kg cm2 and the contents sprayed onto the cascading granules. After the contents have been sprayed, the container is rinsed with a small amount of methylene chloride and spray rinsed onto the granules, and the granules dried by evaporating the methylene chloride. Utilizing the above procedures and varying the amounts and ratios of flucythrinate and phorate or flucythrinate and terbufos yields the granular compositions listed in Table II below.

Treatments are applied at planting to a plot consisting of a single row of corn ten feet long, surrounded by an aluminum lawn edging as a barrier.When the seedlings have reached the two leaf stage, black cutworms which have been grown in a rearing room to the fourth instar, the stage at which they begin cutting plants, are released in each plot over a two week period as shown in Table IV below to simulate a natural infestation of the pest in its destructive stages. Three weeks after the onset of infestation the plots are evaluated and the damage attributed to the black cutworms recorded. The results of these experiments utilizing some of the compositions identified in Example 1 are summarized in Table V below and demonstrate the effectiveness of compositions of the invention in providing protection to seedling corn from black cutworms.
