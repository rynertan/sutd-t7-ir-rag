# Battery state of charge metering method and apparatus.

## Abstract
The system includes a digital integrator 42, 166, 168 having a plurality of digital stages operable to store a numerical value in binary digital form which is indicative of state of charge of a battery 10 . A switching circuit 180 is provided for generating a series of voltage pulses on a single output line FB with each pulse corresponding in length to the binary digital value stored in a integrator to provide a time based resultant indication of the stored binary digital value. A filtering means 48, 50 is included to provide a substantially smooth analog output voltage having an amplitude corres ponding to the summation of the pulses. The system preferably includes a linear array of N light emitting diodes 100 connected to the integrator through one out of N decoder 202 to provide a visual display of charge condition.
