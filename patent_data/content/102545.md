# GEOPHYSICAL DATA RECORDING METHOD

## Abstract
A method in connection with geophysical and particular ly seismic data processing where field generated records are fed into a central computer and processed. The processing involves correlation that in turn involves acquisition para meters related to the field generated records. A method according to this invention uses a micro computer in the field. There, the acquisition parameters are generated and entered on the field generated records ready to be processed with accurate correlation thereafter.
