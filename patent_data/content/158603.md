# Cooling and or temperature control apparatus for extruder, injection molding cylinders or cylinders for other apparatuses for processing plastics, rubber or the like.

## Abstract
The apparatus substantially comprises two semicylin drical structures therebetween a gap is defined provided, at opposite positions, with cooled air inlet and outlet ports. The gap encompasses the portion of the machine to be cooled and or temperature controlled, the air circulation being assured by fans arranged, together with the cylindrical structures, in a box shaped body consisting of two vertically extending opposite walls supported by the extruder cylinder and being closed, at the top and on its sides, by a removable casing, in such a way as to define, on the sides of the semicylindrical structures, cooling air circulation ducts there along air flows before arriving at the gap defined by the semicylindrical structures.
