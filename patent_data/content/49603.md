# LUBRICATION SYSTEM

## Abstract
A cylinder lubrication system for an internal combustion engine, particularly a low speed compression ignition en gine, is controlled electronically. Oil supply to the cylinders is from a ring main gallery 22,41 via oil supply devices 16 having electro magnetically operated valves 19 . An electronic control system 29 actuates valves 19 in response to signals from a timing device 30 . Signals may additionally be generated from an oil pressure sensor 28 , a flow detector 21 and other sensors detecting other engine operating parameters fed into the electronic control system to adjust and control the lubricant supply.
