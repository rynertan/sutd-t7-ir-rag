# Thermosetting acrylic polyvinylidene fluorine composition.

## Abstract
An aqueous dispersed thermosetting coating composi tion comprises a high Tg acrylic latex polymer containing reactive hydroxyl and or carboxyl groups, or similar reactive groups, for cross linking the acrylic polymer, and a polyviny lidene fluoride polymer, wherein the composition is adapted to be heat cured at temperatures above about 350 F. The polyvinyl fluoride polymer fuses and becomes homogenous ly dispersed throughout the thermoset acrylic melamine matrix polymer.
