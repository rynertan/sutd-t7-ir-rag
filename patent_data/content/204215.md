## Description
This invention relates to compounds that are useful in the treatment and prevention of ulcers. More particularly, this invention relates to 2 1H benzimidazol 2 ylsulfinyl methyl benzenamines that inhibit gastric acid secretion and which are, therefore, useful in the treatment of peptic ulcers. The compounds of this invention directly inhibit acid secretion by parietal cells of the stomach through inhibition of H K ATPase. For review, see, e.g., J. G. Spenney, Biochemical Mechanisms of Acid Secretion by Gastric Parietal Cells, Heterocyclylalkylsulfinylbenzimidazoles have been disclosed as gastric acid secretion inhibitors. See U.S. Patent Nos. 4,472,409, 4,394,509, 4,337,257, 4,327,102, 4,255,431, 4,045,564, and 4,045,563 British Patent No. 2,134,523 and German Offenlegungeschrift No. 3,415,971. Some heterocyclylalkylsulfinylbenzimidazoles have also been disclosed as cytoprotective agents. See U.S. Patent No. 4,359,465. The following structure is illustrative of compounds disclosed in these patents wherein R and R represent hydrogen, alkyl, halogen, trifluoromethyl, cyano, carboxy, hydroxy, acyl, and the like R represents hydrogen, alkyl, acyl, alkoxysulfonyl, and the like and Het represents heterocyclic groups containing at least one endocyclic ring nitrogen. No compound disclosed in these patents includes an unsubstituted or substituted phenyl group instead of the Het group nor exocyclic amino or acylamino functions attached to the Het group. In contrast, the compounds of the present invention are distinguished from the prior art by having optionally substituted amino phenyl groups instead of a Het group. Thus, the compounds of the present invention are clearly distinguished from the prior art compounds cited. Heterocyclylalkylsulfinylnaphth 2,3 d imidazoles have also been disclosed as gastric acid secretion inhibitors. See U.S. Patent Nos. 4,248,880 and 4,182,766. The compounds disclosed in these patents are related to those illustrated in the above structure, except for having a substituted naphth 2,3 d imidazole group instead of the benzimidazole group. Similarly, other heterocyclylalkylsulfinylbenzimidazoles having a ring fused to the benzimidazole group have been disclosed as gastric acid secretion inhibitors and cytoprotective agents. See European Patent Application Nos. 130,729 and 127,763. Because of the additional ring fusions of these compounds, as well as for the same reasons stated in the preceding paragraph, the compounds of the present invention are structurally distinguished from prior art compounds cited. The invention relates to compounds of Formula I wherein R¹ is hydrogen, methoxy, ethoxy, or trifluoromethyl and wherein at least one of R³, R⁴, R⁵, and R⁶ is methyl, the others being hydrogen or methoxy, or the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof or the pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts thereof. Although the structure shown for Formula I indicates one tautomeric form, it is understood that this representation is for convenience only and that the scope of this invention includes as equivalents all tautomeric forms of the compounds of this invention. Examples of pharmacologically acceptable acid addition salts include the hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, sulfate, phosphate, acetate, propionate, lactate, maleate, malate, succinate, and tartrate salts. Examples of pharmacologically acceptable base addition salts include lithium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, titanium, ammonium, alkylammomium, dialkylammomium, trialkylammomium, tetraalkylammomium, and guanidinium salts. The compounds of this invention may be prepared by the methods illustrated in the following Schemes. Unless otherwise specified, the various substituents are defined as for Formula I, above. Scheme A illustrates the preparation of sulfur containing intermediates of Formula IV. Intermediates of Formula IV are prepared by at least two routes, each of which uses a 2 mercaptobenzimidazole of Formula II. In the preferred route, the 2 mercaptobenzimidazole reacts with a 2 aminobenzyl halide Formula III in which Y is a halogen, preferably chlorine or bromine . Typical conditions include reaction at room temperature in an organic solvent such as absolute ethanol or isopropyl alcohol. For those compounds which form hydrohalide salts, the corresponding neutral compounds of Formula IV are readily obtained by methods known to those skilled in the art. For example, treating such a salt with base such as aqueous potassium carbonate or preferably sodium hydroxide , followed by extraction into a non protic organic solvent such as dichloromethane or chloroform , gives the free base form of an intermediate of Formula IV. The 2 aminobenzyl halides of Formula III in which Y is halogen are obtained commercially or are prepared from corresponding 2 aminobenzyl alcohols Formula III in which Y is OH or 2 methylsulfinylmethylanilines Formula III in which Y is CH₃SO by synthetic methods well known in the art. For example, reaction of the alcohol with a halogenating reagent, such as thionyl chloride, phosphorus oxychloride, oxalyl chloride, and the like, in an inert organic solvent, such as dichloromethane or chloroform, will give corresponding 2 aminobenzyl chlorides as the hydrochloride salts. A preferred method involves heating the alcohol in concentrated hydrochloric or hydrobromic acid at temperatures of 80 to 100 . See B. Beilenson and F. M. Hamer, Where an appropriate 2 aminobenzyl halide of Formula III is not readily available, intermediates of Formula IV may also be prepared by an acid catalyzed reaction of the 2 mercaptobenzimidazole of Formula II with 2 aminobenzyl alcohols. Preferred conditions include heating a mixture of compounds of Formulas II and III in glacial acetic acid containing excess relative to II and III sulfuric acid. After quenching the reaction by pouring the mixture over ice, the intermediate compounds IV are isolated by methods known in the art, including recrystallization and chromatography. Where an initially required 2 aminobenzyl alcohol is not commercially available, corresponding 2 aminobenzoic acids or 2 aminobenzaldehydes may be reduced using methods known in the art, such as hydrogenation, reaction with lithium aluminum hydride, and the like. Various methods for preparing appropriate aminobenzoic acids are known. See, e.g., Baker The sulfoxide compounds of this invention, Formula I, are prepared by oxidation of the intermediates of Formula IV using methods known to those skilled in the art. Commonly used oxidizing agents include, for example, peracids, such as Certain of the 2 amino compounds of Formula III are more conveniently prepared as phthalimide derivatives that is, where NH₂ is the phthalimide group and used to prepare corresponding phthalimide derivatives of compounds of Formula IV, as illustrated in the Examples. Although treatment of such phthalimide derivatives with hydrazine in an alcohol would yield corresponding anilines that is, compounds of Formula IV where R⁷ and R⁸ are both hydrogen , the preferred next step is oxidation as described above to corresponding phthalimide derivatives of sulfoxides of Formula I. Treatment of the phthalimide derivatives of such sulfoxides with hydrazine hydrate in an alcohol, preferably methanol or ethanol, yields compounds of Formula I. Acid addition salts of this invention may be prepared during the course of the reactions as described above , by ion exchange from those or other such salts using methods known in the art, or by acidification of free bases of the compounds. Base addition salts of this invention by methods known in the art, including those methods disclosed in British Patent No. 2,137,616. Although some of the 2 mercaptobenzimidazoles of Formula II are commercially available, others may be prepared by synthetic methods known to those skilled in the art. For example, Scheme B illustrates the preparation of 2 mercaptobenzimidazoles from substituted diaminobenzenes of Formula V. A preferred cyclization method employs an alkali metal alkylxanthate salt of the formula alkyl O C O S M , where M represents an alkali metal ion. Such an alkylxanthate salt may be preformed by methods known in the art or may be formed The most preferred embodiments of this invention include compounds of the following general structure, wherein R¹ is methoxy or ethoxy and wherein R⁴ is methyl, the others being hydrogen. The compounds of this invention exhibited gastric antisecretory activity in canines, as indicated by inhibition in vitro of H K ATPase obtained from canine gastric mucosa and by inhibition in vivo of gastric acid secretion in dogs. The antisecretory activity of the compounds of this invention illustrated in the Examples was determined by the following methods. Mongrel dogs weighing 15 to 25 kilograms were fasted for twenty four hours, with water provided ad libitum. The animals were anesthetized with pentobarbital and the stomachs were removed. Subsequent tissue manipulations and subcellular fractionations were performed at 0 to 4 C. After the stomachs were cut open and rinsed with tap water, the antral and cardiac regions were removed and the remaining tissue was rinsed three times in saline. The glandular mucosa was removed mechanically, chopped finely in a medium containing 10 mM Tris hydrochloride pH 7.4 and 250 mM sucrose, and homogenized. The homogenate was centrifuged at 20,000xg for twenty minutes and the pellet discarded. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 150,000xg for ninety minutes and the supernatant discarded. The pellet was resuspended in the Tris HCl sucrose medium by homogenization. Part 2 ml of the resultant microsomal suspension was layered onto a step gradient consisting of 9 ml of 15 sucrose above 12 ml of 30 sucrose, each sucrose solution being buffered with 10 mM Tris hydrochloride pH 7.4 containing 0.01 sodium aside. The microsomes retained at the 15 30 sucrose interface, after centrifugation at 250,000xg for sixty minutes, were used as the source of H K ATPase. Microsomal preparations were lyophilized, a process that assured potassium ion permiability, and stored at 10 until used. H K ATPase activity for each test compound was determined, in duplicate, by measuring the release of inorganic phosphate, which was assayed according to the method of J. ChandraRajan and L. Klein. H K ATPase activity is represented by the difference between the measured activities in the presence of potassium ion K stimulated and in the absence of potassium ion basal . The concentration of a test compound required to inhibit 50 of the H K ATPase activity i.e., the IC₅₀ was determined at least in duplicate using linear regression analysis of results obtained for three different compound concentrations ranging from 0.1 mcM to 0.2 mM. If the IC₅₀ for a test compound could not be determined for the concentration range tested, percent inhibition of H K ATPase was obtained for the compound at 0.1 mM. Adult female beagle dogs weighing 6 to 11 kilograms obtained from Laboratory Research Enterprises Kalamazoo, Mich. or from Hazelton Research Animals Cumberland, Va. were surgically implanted with a simple Thomas type gastric cannula. After recovery from surgery, the dogs were trained to stand quietly, fully conscious, in Pavlov type dog restraining slings and were acclimated to intravenous infusion of histamine dihydrochloride. During the course of these studies, no dog was used more than once a week. All dogs were deprived of food, but not water, for 18 hours prior to each assay. Each dog was initially infused with 0.15 M sodium chloride solution at a constant rate of 6.5 mg hr. The volume of gastric secretions, collected in plastic bottles affixed to the cannula, were measured to the nearest 0.1 ml at 30 minute intervals. One of the following protocols was followed, depending on the route chosen for administration of test compound. Data from each protocol were analyzed for three gastric sample variables volume of gastric juice, acid concentration, and total acid output. Percent inhibition for each four hour experimental period was determined for each parameter by comparison with 3 to 4 controls in which only food was given. Estimates of ED₅₀ s were determined from dose response curves. Adult female beagle dogs weighing 6 to 10 kilograms were obtained from Laboratory Research Enterprises Kalamazoo, Mich. or from Hazelton Research Animals Cumberland, Va. . Surgical implantation of a Thomas type gastric cannula into an innervated Pavlov pouch of each dog was performed by the method reported by L. Burrows Data were analyzed for three different variables volume of gastric juice, acid concentration, and total acid output. Percent inhibition for the four hour experimental period was determined for each parameter by comparison with 3 to 4 controls. Estimates of ED₅₀ were determined from dose response curves.
