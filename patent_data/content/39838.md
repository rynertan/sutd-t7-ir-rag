## Description
This invention relates to a glass fiberreinforced unsaturated polyester resin composition having excellent ultraviolet transmissibility, and to a product molded therefrom, such as a clear glass fiberreinforced panel. More specifically, the invention pertains to an ultraviolet transmissible glass fiber reinforced composition comprising an unsaturated polyester resin which is produced without using an aromatic polybasic acid and an aromatic polyhydric alcohol as starting materials and to its use, for example, as a clear glass fiber reinforced panel and also a greenhouse built by using this panel. Molded articles of glass fiber reinforced resins in the form of a corrugated or flat plate produced from an unsaturated polyester resin and glass fibers have been widely used as building materials1 such as lighting windows of factories and panels of agricultural houses because of their various advantages such as lighter weight and higher impact strength than glass articles, rapid producibility, and low costs. Since, however, unsaturated polyester resins are generally derived from aromatic polybasic acids as raw materials, cured products thereof have very low ultraviolet transmissibility, and poor weatherability in outdoor service. Various methods have been investigated heretofore for removing these defects of unsaturated polyester resin compositions. For example, a method was proposed which involves adding an ultraviolet absorber to an unsaturated polyester resin. Molded plates prepared in accordance with this method have improved weatherability, but because they are substantially non transmissible to ultraviolet rays, are unsuitable for panels in agricultural and sanitary applications which require transmission of ultraviolet rays. A method was also suggested in which a meth acrylic resin is mainly used aS a resin composition. According to this method, ultraviolet transmissibility and weatherability are improved, but the curing time is much longer than in the case of using an unsaturated polyester resin, and productivity in commercial applications is drastically reduced.In addition, cured products obtained by this method are brittle and because of their poor adhesion to glass fibers, whitening occures m the interface between the resin and the glass fibers and the transparency of the product is markedly reduced. It is an object of this invention therefore to provide a resin composition capable of producing molded articles, particularly plate like molded articles, having excellent ultraviolet transmiss ibil ity, weatherability and transparency. We have now found that molded articles having excellent ultraviolet transmissibility, weatherability and transparency can be obtained by preparing sn unsaturated polyester resin from a vinyl monomer and an unsaturated polyester obtained by using maleic acid or maleic anhydride and or fumaric acid and another aliphatic polybasic acid and or an alicyclic polybasic acid without an aromatic polybasic acid as an acid component and an aliphatic polyhydric alcohol and or an alicyclic polyhydric alcohol without an aromatic polyhydric alcohol as an alcohol component, impregnating glass fibers with the resulting unsaturated polyester resin, and curing the resulting composition. According to this invention, there is provided a glass fiber reinforced composition comprising I an unsaturated polyester resin and iiJ glass fibers, said unsaturated polyester resin I being composed of A 50 to 80 by weight of an unsaturated polyester prepared from an acid component consisting of 10 to 60 mole of maleic acid or maleic anhydride and or fumaric acid and 90 to 40 mole of another aliphatic polybasic acid and or an alicyclic polybasic acid and an alcohol component composed of an aliphatic polyhydric alcohol End or an alicyclic polyhydric alcohol, and B 50 to 2S by weight of an aromatic vinyl monomer or a mixture of it with an acrylic or methacrylic monomer. Plate like molded articles produced from this composition have excellent ultraviolet transmissibility, weatherability and transparency, and can be advantageously used, for example, as panels of greenhouses. Dicarboxylic acids are usually employed as the other aliphatic polybasic acid than maleic acid or maleic anhydride and fumaric acid and the alicyclic polybasic acid. Dicarboxylic acids having not more than 10 carbon atoms are preferred.A tri or higher carboxylic acid is preferably used in combination with the dicarboxylic acid. Examples of such polybasic acids include aliphatic dicarboxylic acids such as adipic acid, succinic acid, azelaic acid and sebacic acid and lower alkyl esters thereof alicyclic dicarboxylic acids and lower alkyl esters thereof, such as hexahydrophthalic anhydride, methyl hexahydrophthal ic anhydride, and dimethyl l,4 cyclohexanedicarboxy late. The aliphatic polyhydric alcohol and alicyclic polyhydric alcohol preferably have 2 to 15 carbon atoms.Examples include aliphatic polyhydric alcohols such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol 1,4 1, butanediol, 1,3 butanediol, 2,3 butanediol, diethylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, triethylene glycol, 1,5 pentanediol, 1,6hexanediol, neopentyl glycol, 2, 2,4 trimethylpentanediol, 1,3 pentaerythritol diallyl ether, trimethylene glycol, 2 ethyl l,3 hexanediol, allyl glycidyl ether, trimethylolmethane and trimethylolpropane and alicyclic polyhydric alcohols such as 1,4 cyclohexane dimethanol and hydrogenated bisphenol A. The proportion of maleic acid or maleic anhydride and or fumaric acid in the acid component is 10 to 60 mole , preferably 20 to 50 mole . If the proportion is less than 10 mole , the mechanical strength of a molded article prepared from the resulting resin composition is reduced. If it is larger than 60 mole , the molded article has reduced transmissibility to ultraviolet rays. The unsaturated polyester prepared from the aforesaid acid component and polyhydric alcohol component preferably has an acid value of 10 to 60, a hydroxyl value of 30 to 70 and a molecular weight per double bond factor of 300 to 1300. The aromatic vinyl monomer includes, for example, styrene, divinylbenzene, vinyltoluene, tbutylstyrene and a methylstyrene. Examples of the acrylic or methacrylic monomer are acrylic acid esters such as methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, propyl acrylate, butyl acrylate, octyl acrylate, 2 ethylhexyl acrylate, cyclohexyl acrylate, dodecyl acrylate, octadecyl acrylate, glycidyl acrylate and 2 hydroxyethyl acrylate methacrylic acid esters such as methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, propyl methacrylate, butyl methacrylate, hexyl methacrylate, octyl methacrylate, 2 ethylhexyl methacrylate, dodecyl methacrylate, octadecyl methacrylate, 1,6 hexanediol dimethacrylate, trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate, glycidyl methacrylate and 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate unsaturated carboxylic acids such as acrylic acid and methacrylic acid and unsaturated nitriles such as acrylonitrile and methacrylonitrile.At least one such acrylic or methacrylic monomer is used in combination with the aforesaid aromatic vinyl monomer. The suitable proportion of the acrylic or methacrylic monomer is 50 to 0.5pea by weight as against 50 to 99.5 by weight of the aromatic vinyl monomer.If the amount of the vinyl aromatic monomer is less than 5CVo by weight, an unsaturated bond of the maleic acid or fumaric acid ester type remains in the cured product, and therefore the cured product has reduced ultraviolet transmissibility and weatherability. The acrylic or methacrylic monomer in the amounts within the specified range is suitable for adjusting the refractive index of the resulting unsaturated polyester resin I to 1.495 1.538. The unsaturated polyester resin I used in the composition of this invention comprises 50 to 8 by weight, preferably 65 to 750 p by weight, of the unsaturated polyester A and 50 to 2 pro by weight, preferably 35 to 25 by weight, of the aromatic vinyl monomer or its mixture with the acrylic or methacrylic monomer.These quantitative ranges have been determined by considering the impregnating of the resin I during molding, prevention of unevenness in thickness of the molded articles, etc. The unsaturated polyester resin I preferably has a refractive index of 1.495 to 1.538 so as to achieve better ultraviolet transmissibility, weatherability and transparency. It is desirable however to select an unsaturated polyester resin I having an optimum refractive index within the aforesaid range depending upon the refractive index of the glass fibers used.Specifically, when glass fibers, particularly C glass, having a refractive index of 1.512 to 1.535 are used, resins I having a refractive index of 1.495 to 1.510 are suitable when glass fibers having a refractive index of 1.536 to 1.545 are used, resins 1 having a refractive index of 1.511 to 1.520 are suitable and when glass fibers, particularly E glass, having a refractive index of 1.546 to 1.557 are used, resins I3 having a refractive index of 1.521 to 1.538 are suitable. Normally, the unsaturated polyester resin I is liquid, and in order to cure it, a catalyst is added.Aliphatic or alicyclic organic peroxides such as t butyl peracetate, t butyl perpivalate, t butyl perisobutyrate, diisopropyl peroxydicarbonate and dimethoxybutyl peroxycarbonate are preferred as such a curing catalyst because a molded article having excellent ultraviolet transmissibility can be provided. The amount of the curing catalyst is usually 0.5 to 2 o by weight. The glass fibers II used in the composition of this invention usually have a refractive index of about 1.512 to about 1.557. For example, C glass chemical glass and Glass electrical glass are suitable. These glass fibers are in the form of, for example, rovings, chopped strands, mats, cloths, etc., but are not limited thereto. The amount of the glass fibers II is usually 10 to 4CVo by weight, preferably 15 to 50 by weight, as against 90 to 60n o by weight, preferably 85 to 7 by weight, or the unsaturated polyester resin I . The resulting composition comprising the unsaturated polyester resin 13 and the glass fibers is molded in a customary manner, and cured at room temperature to 1300C, preferably 80 to 12000. Curing with redox systems comprising organic peroxides and organometallic salts is not desirable as it results. in a marked deterioration in ultraviolet transmissibility of the molded articles. It is possible to bond an ultraviolettransmissible film of a fluorocarbon resin such as polyvinyl fluoride and a tetrafluoroethylene hexafluoro propylene copolymer to the surface of a molded article prepared from the composition of this invention, or to gel coat its surface with the unsaturated polyester resin I used in the invention or an ultraviolettransmissible acrylic resin. Bonding of such a film, or gel coat treatment is beneficial because the glass fibers are prevented from appearing on the surface of the molded article in outdoor exposure. The suitable thickness of the film or the gel coat layer is 10 to 50 microns. The composition of this invention is useful for producing clear glass fiber reinforced panels having ultraviolet transmissibility, weatherability and transparency. These panels are conveniently used for agricultural and sanitary applications, especially as lighting panels of agricultural or horticultural greenhouses. The use of such panels in a greenhouse is described below at sone length. A clear glass fiber reinforced panel to be abbreviated FRP panel can be obtained by impregnating the unsaturated polyester resin I containing a peroxide added thereto in a glass fiber mat II , and then curing the prepreg at a temperature of 60 to 130 Cm preferably 80 to 120 C, using, for example, a conventional machine for continuously producing corrugated or flat plates.The shape of the FRP panel is not limited to a flat or corrugated shape. The suitable thickness of the FRP panel for greenhouses is 0.4 to 2.0 mm, preferably 0.6 to 1.2 mm, in view of its relation to ultraviolet transmissibility and mechanical strength. The suitable content of glass fibers is 10 to 40 by weight, preferably 15 to 30 0 by weight. because the FRP panel permits transmission of ultraviolet rays and visible light. The ultraviolet transmissibility of the FRP panel is also effective for preventing abnormal growth of pathogenic bacteria or molds in plants within the greenhouse. Furthermore, the greenhouse of the invention can withstand long term use because of the excellent weatherability of the FRP panel. The following Examples illustrate the present invention more specifically. All parts in these examples are by weight.Example 1 A reactor equipped with a condenser and a stirrer was charged with 60 parts of hydrogenated bisphenol A HBPA , 3 parts of propylene glycol PG , using an integral spectrophotometer EPS 3T, an instrument made by Hitachi Limited .

Example 2 A reactor equipped with a condenser and a stirrer was charged with 22 parts of propylene glycol PG , 28 parts of hydrogenated bisphenol A HBPA , 38 parts of adipic acid AA and 12 parts of maleic anhydride MA , and these materials were heated to 200 C while blowing nitrogen into the reactor from an opening near its bottom. When the reaction proceeded unitl the acid value of the reaction mixture became 45, 50 ppm of hydroquinone was added.Then, the reaction mixture was diluted with styrene and methyl methacrylate so that the content of styrene SM and the content of methyl methacrylate MMA reached 2CN o by weight and 1Cg by weight, respectively, based on the total amount of the mixture. Thus, an unsaturated polyester resin No. 1 was obtained. In a similar manner, unsaturated polyester resins Nos. 2 to 5 shown in Table 2 were obtained. InTable 2, PA stands for phthalic anhydride. Each of these unsaturated polyester resins was mixed with 1 by weight of t butyl perpivalate, and after deaeration, the mixture was impregnated into a chopped strand glass mat. The prepreg was cured in a hot air dryer at 90 C for 20 minutes to produce a flat FRP panel having a thickness of 1 mm and a glass content of 25 by weight. The ultraviolet transmittance of the resulting FRP plate at ultraviolet transmissible wavelengths and 320 m was measured in the same way as in Example 1. The results are shown in Table 2.

Each of FRP panels A to E mentioned below was secured to the framework to build each of greenhouses I to V of the type shown in Figure 1 which had a front width of 4.5 m, a depth of 10.8 m, a height, to the roof on each side of the greenhouse, of 2.0 m and a ridge height of 2.95 m. The FRP panel A was produced in the following manner. An unsaturated polyester was prepared by condensing 13 parts of maleic anhydride MA , 38 parts of adipic acid AA , 21 parts of propylene glycol PG and 28 parts of hydrogenated bisphenol A HBPA in a customary manner. Then, 20 parts of styrene SM , 6 parts of methyl methacrylate MMA and 1 by weight of t butyl perpivalate were blended with the unsaturated polyester to form an unsaturated polyester resin. The unsaturated polyester resin was impregnated in a glass roving mat cut to a length of 2 inches.Both surfaces of the prepreg were coated with a polyvinyl alcohol film, and the prepreg was then cured at 900C in a hot air dryer for 20 minutes to obtain an FRP plate A having a thickness of 1 mm, a length of 126 cm and, a width of 96 cm, and a glass content of 25 by weight. The FRP panels B to E were produced in the same way as in the production of the FRP panel A except that the starting materials shown in Table 4 were used.The FRP plate E is the type now commercially available.In Table 4, PA stands for phthalic anhydride, and R7wPA, for hexahydrophthalic anhydride. The ultraviolet transmittances of the FRP platesA to E at various wavelengths were measured by the s ame spectro photometer as used in Example 1. The results are plotted in Figure 2.
