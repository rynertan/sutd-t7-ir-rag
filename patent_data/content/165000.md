# Metal halogen secondary battery.

## Abstract
A metal halogen secondary battery with electrolyte circulation means 16, 18 28, 31 which has a high state of charging and a capability of storing a large charge of electric power at a high density. In each unit cell of this battery the electrolyte pressure in the positive electrode chamber 8 is maintained higher than the electrolyte pressure in the negative electrode chamber 10 . Positive electrolyte contain ing metal ions in the positive electrode chamber 8 is permeated through the separator 6 into the negative electrode chamber 10 and the metal ions are there reduced, and halogen ions in the negative electrode chamber 10 are also permeated through the separator into the positive electrode chamber 8 and oxidized, thereby contributing to the storage of the electric power.
