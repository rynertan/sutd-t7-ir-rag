R is selected from the group consisting of EMI64.1 In accordance with Flowsheet N the vinyl iodide 145 is treated with either one equivalent of n butyllithium or 2 equivalents of t butyllithium at low temperature, preferably 300C to 700C in an inert solvent, eg. hexane, ether or toluene to provide the trans alkenyl lithium reagent 147 . Alternatively, the vinylliFhium reagent 147 can be prepared by treatment of a vinylstannyl derivative such as 146 with n butyllithium at 100 to 78 C in ether or THF. For the preparation of the asymmetrical lithio cuprate 148 or the like, a solution of one molar equivalent of copper I l alkyne, preferably copper I l pentyne in anhydrous hexamethyiphosphorous triamide preferably one to five molar equivalents, and anhydrous ether is added to one molar equivalent of the aforementioned vinyllithium solution cooled to about 780C. After about one hour at this temperature, a molar equivalent of the requisite cyclopentenone 151 is added. After several hours at 78 C to 200C the reaction mixture is quenched with aqueous ammonium chloride solution and the blocked product 152 is isolated in the usual manner. It is also possible to effect conjugate 1,4 addition with the asymmetrical lithio cuprate 150 derived from vinyllithium 147 and cuprous thiophenoxide. A solution of vinyllithium 147 in ether at 780C is reacted with an equimolar amount of a reagent prepared by admixture, in ether at a temperature of 00C to 780C, of equimolar amounts of cuprous thiophenoxide and copper I iodide tributylphosphonium complex. After about 30 minutes at this temperature, the lithio cuprate 150 is treated with the requisite cyclopentenone 120 as described hereinabove for the conjugate addition with l alkynyl lithio cuprate 148 . For the preparation of the symmetrical lithio cuprate 149 one molar equivalent of copper I iodide tributylphosphine complex, dissolved in anhydrous ether7 is added at about 780C to two molar equivalents of the aforementioned vinyllithium 147 solution in hexanes, cooled to 780C. After about one hour at this temperature, the lithio cuprate 149 is treated with the requisite cyclopentenone 151 as described hereinabove for the conjugate addition with the l alkynyl lithio cuprate 148 . The procedures for conjugate addition involving organocopper reagents are well known in the art, see for example, C.J. Sih, et al., J.A.C.S., 97, 865 1975 . All available evidence leads us to believe that the CH CH R2 function introduced by the cuprate process occupies a position trans to the ll oxy function.Similarly, we are led to the conclusion that in the product 152 the two side chains attached to C8 and C12 are trans to each other. .Howeve , we are not certain of this configurational relationsh .p in the product as it is obtained directly from the cuprate process. These products may have the side chains in a trans or cis relationship or they may be a mixture containing both the trans and cis isomers. This is indicated in the nomenclature of the compounds involved by the designation 82. In order to ensure a trans relationship 152 these products can be submitted to conditions known in the literature to equilibrate the cis 8 iso PGE1 to a mixture containing about 90 of the trans product. These conditions involve treatment with potassium acetate in aqueous methanol for 96 hours at room temperature. FLOWSHEET NEMI68.1 EMI69.1 When Tl isEMI70.1 removal of the blocking groups from 152 to give the prostaglandin congener 154 is accomplished by treatment of 152 with a mixture of acetic acid, tetrahydrofuran and water 4 2 1 at 25e to 550C.When T isEMI70.2 152 can be partially deblocked to give ketal i53 by treatment of 151 with 0.6N hydrochloric acid in tetrahydrofuran at room temperature for 4 to 7 hours. R3 is hydrogen and hydroxyl . In certain cases it is possible to convert the carboxylic acid function of a prostaglandin congener into a terminal hydroxymethyl ketone function as shown in Flowsheet 0 hereinbelow wherein Z, C13 C14, and R2 is as hereinabove defined. Treatment of a prostaglandin congener 155 in which the ll hydroxy group and the hydroxy groups of the 13 chain are protected with a suitable group such as acetate or a dimethyl t butylsilyl ether with oxalyl chloride in benzene or dichloromethane for 2 to 5 hours furnishes the acid chloride 156 , wherein R3 is hydrogen or a protected oxygen group. The protected ll hydroxyl acid chloride compound may be prepared in the manner described above in Flowsheet K. The prostaglandin congeners 155 may be prepared by the 1,4 conjugate addition of the suitably protected cyclopentenones 100 or 111 such as cyclopentenone 112 and the lithiocuprate 148,149 or 150 by the procedures disclosed herein by the examples andFlowsheet N. Addition of the acid chloride 156 , dissolved in ether, to an ether solution of at least three equivalents of diazomethane gives the diazoketone 157 .Hydrolysis of the diazoketone using aqueous sulfuric acid and tetrahydrofuran at about 0 550C gives the hydroxymethyl ketone analog 158 . The acetate protecting group can be removed by refluxing with acidified methanol.The dimethyl t butylsilyl ether protecting group can be removed by treatment with aqueous hydrochloric acid in tetrahydrofuran at 25 to 600C. Flowsheet OEMI72.1 When the compounds of this invention are prepared from racemic starting compounds two racemates are obtained.In appropriate instances these racemates can be separated from each other by careful application of the usual chromatographic procedures. In the more difficult instances it may be necessary to apply high pressure liquid chromatography including recycling techniques. SeeG. Fallick, American Laboratory, 19 27 August, 1973 herein incorporated by reference, as well as references cited therein.Additional information concerning high speed liquid chromatography and the instruments necessary for its application is available from Waters Associate,Inc., Maple Street, Milford, Mass. It is also possible to prepare the compounds of this invention in their optically active forms by the conversion of the optically active 4 hydroxycyclopent2 en 1 one carboxylic acids 159 to the optically active protected hydroxy ketone analog 160 using the methods outlined hereinabove in Flowsheet P. Fiowsheet PEMI74.1 When one utilizes a racemic cyclopentenone 151 and a racemic vinyliodide 145 or racemic vinylstannane 146 the conjugate adduct isolated 154 or 155 consists of a mixture of 4 optical isomers. These four optical isomers are, in the case of the 15 deoxy 16 hydroxyprostaglandins, identified as nat. 16a, nat. 16ss, ent 16a and ent 16ss. Silica gel chromatography of the 4 isomers 154 or 155 will provide two fractions consisting of nat. 16a and ent 166 and nat. 16 and ent 16. If one utilizes a resolved cyclopentenone 151 that contains the 4 R configuration, and a racemic vinyliodide 145 or racemic vinylstannane 146 , the conjugate adduct isolated 154 or 155 consists of a mixture of twooptical isomers. These two optical isomers are, in the case of the 15 deoxy 16 hydroxyprostaglandins, identified as nat. 16a and nat. 16B. Silica gel chromatography of the two isomers will provide separated nat. 16a and separated nat. 16ss. If one utilizes an optically active vinyliodide 145 or optically active vinylstannane 146 and a racemic cyclopentenone 151 , then the conjugate adduct isolated 154 and 155 consists of two optical isomers If the vinyl iodide 145 or vinylstannane 146 used would provide the nat. 16a as one of the products, the other product will be ent 16a. Likewise, the products from a vinyliodide 145 or vinylstannane 146 of the opposite optical configuration will be nat 16a and ent 16 . Silica gel chromatography will separate nat. 16a from ent 16a and likewise, nat. 16 is separable from ent 165. IF one utilizes a resolved cyclopentenone i51 that contains the 4 R configuration and an optically act vinyliodide 145 or optically active vinylstannane 146 , then the conjugate adduct 154 and 155 will consist of or one optical isomer, which will be either nat. 16a or nat. 16 ,depending upon the configuration of the starting vinyl iodide 145 or vinylstannane 146 . In accordance with the following reaction scheme prostanoids are prepared as described by Stork in J.A.C.S.97, 474 1975 and J.A.C.S. 97, 6260 1975 which are incorporated by reference. EMI76.1 Treatment of the protected 4 oxycylcylopentenone A with a cuprate such as 148 , 149 or 150 as hereinabove defined, followed by quenching with formaldehyde to provide the hydroxymethyl analog B which is dehydrated with reagents such as excess methansulfonyl chloride in pyridine followed by treatment of the crude mesylate with diissopropylethylamine in ether overnight. R341, R3 and R are as previously defined. Addition of the methylenecyclopentanone C to a solution of the grignard MgBr CH2 R1 wherein f is as previ ousLy defined and k is a substituent selected from the group Ri wherein the hydroxyl group of the substituent is protected by a suitable blocking group such as 2 methoxy propyl 2 oxy, and a catalytic amount of Bu3P.CuI BYis tertiary butyl followed by mild hydrolysis of the adduct provides the product prostanoid E wherein f, R3 and R2 are as previously defined. The bromide precursor to the grignard described above is prepared in accordance with the procedure of Flowsheet L. Conjugate addition of the vinyl cuprates to 129 followed by deblocking as described hereinabove inFlow sheet N then gives the compounds of this invention in their optically active forms. Although in some cases two diastereoisomers will be formed, each optically active, they can be separated by chromatographic procedures as described hereinabove. The preparation of optically active 4 hydroxycyclopent 2 en l ones such as 159 is described hereinbelow. The 4 hydroxycyclopentenone racemates may be resolved into their component enantiomers 161 and 162 by derivatizing the ketone function with a reagent having an optically active center. The resulting diastereomeric mixture can then be separated by fractional crystallization, or by chromatoraphy, or by high speed liquid chromatography involving if necessary, recycling techniques. Among the useful optically active ketone derivatizing reagents are l u aminoxy y methylpentanoic acid hydrochloride to give 163 , R 2 aminoxy 3,3dimethylbutyric acid hydrochloride, and 4 a methyl benzyl semicarbazide. After separation of the diastereomeric derivatives, reconstitution of the keto function provides the individual 4 hydroxycyclopentenone enantiomers 161 and 162 .A useful procedure for the resolution of a 4 hydroxycyclopentenone racemate via an oxime such as 132 is described in the art R. Pappo, P. Collins and C. Jung, Tetrahedron Letters, 943 1973 , herein incorporated by reference. EMI80.1 An alternate procedure or the preparation of the 4 R3 hyòrcxycyclopentenone enantiorrers such as 161 involve as a key step the selective microbiological or chemical reduction of trione 164 to the 4 R hydroxycyclopentanedione 165 . A wide variety of microorganism are capable of accomplishing this asymmetric reduction, one of the mcst useful being Dipodascus unincleatus.This step also can be achieved chemically by catalytic hydrogenation in the usual manner for example, under about ne atmosphere of hydrogen in methanol using a soluble rhodiem catalyst with chiral phosphine ligands, such as 1,5 zyclooctadiene bs o anis ylcyclohexylmethylphosphine rhodium I tetrafluoroborate in the presence of one equivalent o organic base, such as tri ethyl amine. Conversion of hydroxycyclopentanedione 165 to an enol ether or enrol ester, 156 , E.w alkyl, preferably iso propyl aroyl such as benzoyl, or arylsulfonyl such as 2 mesitylenesulfonyl , is accomplished by treatment, for example, with isopropyl iodide and a base such as potassium carbonate in refluxing acetone for from 15 to 20 hours., cr with a base such as triethylamine and 0.95 equivalents of benzoyl chloride or a slight excess of 2 mesitylenesulfonyl chloride, in a non prototropic solvent at a temperature of about 10 to lS C. neduction of 166 with excess sodium bis 2 methoxyethoxy aluminium hydride in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran or toluene at low temperatures, such as 60 to 78 C, followed by mild acid hydrolysis representative conditions aqueous dilute hydrochloric acid, pH 2.5 or oxalic acid, sodium oxalate in chloroform at ambient temperatures from 1 to 3 hours provides the 4 R hydroxycyclopente none ester 167 The ester 157 can then be hydrolized to acid 161 For a description of these procedures in the art see C.

One useful procedure is outlined below and involves alkylation of ethyl acetoacetate sodium salt 170 in the usual manner with the appropiate side chain precursor 171 , K Cl, Br, I, preferably Br or I followed by decarbethoxylation and reesterification, all in the usual manner. EMI84.1 The side chain precursors 171 are commercially available where Z is Cli2 p , and can be prepared as described in Belgian Patent 786, 215 granted and opened to inspection January 15, 1973 . Those precursors wherein Z is CH2 t O CH2 csn be prepared by the transformytion show directly below start ing with the mono tetrahydropyranyl derivative 174 .

J.A.C.S. 94, 2123 1972 or E.J. Corey J.O.C. 3S, 3187 1973 which are incorporated by reference, the PGA1, PGAo or PGA2 series compounds of this invention may be converted to the corresponding PGE0, PGE1 or PGE2 compound. This conversion is accomplished b treating either the protected or unprotected PGA compounds i.e. 191 or 197 with alkaline hydrogen peroxide to provide a mixture of isomeric 10,11 epoxides which, without separation is reduced with chromous acetate in acidic acid or by aluminum amalgum to provide after hydrolysis if necessary and silica gel chromatography, the lla hydroxy PGE compounds and a lesser amount of the corresponding 11 epimer. The novel compounds of the present invention have potential utility as hypotensive agents, anti ulcer agents, agents for the treatment of gastric hypersecretion and gastric erosion, agents to provide protection against the ulcerogenic and other gastric difficulties associated with the use of various nonsteroidal anti inflammatory agents e.g., insometha cin, aspirin, and phenylbutazone , bronchodilators, anti in flammatory agents, abortifacients, agents for the induction of labor, agents for the induction of menses, fertility control ling agents, oestrus regulators for use in animal husbandry with cattle and other domestic animals and central nervous system regulator agents.Certain of the novel compounds of this invention possess utility as intermediates for the prepa ration of the other novel compounds of this invention. The novel compounds of this invention possess the pharmacological activity described below as associated with the appropriate above described prostaglandin types. The known PGE, PGF , PGF , PGA and PGD compounds are all potent in causing multiple biological responses even at low doses. For example, PGE1, PGE2, PGA1 and PSA2 are ex tremly potent in causing vasodepression and smooth muscle stimulation, and also are potent as antilipolytic agents. For 1 example, the ll deoxy GE compounds of this invention are selective in that they are at most relatively weak stimulants of smooth muscle. A further advantage of these noel compound should be in their increased stabilities and lengthened self lives. Therefore, each of these novel prostaglandin analog of this invention should be more useful than one of the corresponding above mentioned known prostaglandins for at least one of the pharmacological purposes indicated below for the latter, either because it has a dif fervent and narrower spectrum of biological activity than the known prostaglandins, and therefore is more specific in its activity and causes smaller and fewer undesired side effects than the known prostaglandins, or because of its prolonged activity, fewer and smaller doses of the novel prostaglandin analog can frequently be used to attain the desired result. Another advantage of the novel compounds of this invention, corpared with the known prostaglandins, is that these novel compounds are administered effectively oraliy, sublingually, intravaginally, buccally, or rectally, in addi tion to the usual intravenous, instramuscular, or subcutaneous injection or infusion methods indicated above for the uses of the known prostaglandins. These qualities are advantageous because they facilitate maintaining uniform levels of these compounds in the body with fewer, shorter, or smaller doses, and make possible self administration by the patient. PGE1, PGE2, PGE3, dihydro PGE1, PGFC, PGFss and PGA compounds, their esters and pharmacologically acceptable salts, are extremely potent in causing various biological responses. For that reason, these compounds are useful for pharmacological purposes. See, for example, Bergstrome, , et al., Pharmacol. Rev., 20, 1 1968 , and references cited herein.A few of those biological responses are systemic arterial blood pressure lowering in the case of the PGA and PGr compounds as measured, for example, in anesthetized sodium phenobarbital pentolinium treated rats with indwelling aortic and right heart cannulas pressor activity, similarly measured, for the PGF compounds stimulation of amooth muscle as shown for example, by tests on strips of guinea pig ileum, rabbit duodenum, or gerbil colon potentiation of other smooth muscle stimulants antilipolytic activity as shown by antagonism of epinephrine induced mobilization of free fatty acids or inhibit tion of the spontaneous release of glycerol from isolated rat fat pads inhibition of gastric secretion in the case of PGE compounds, as shown in dogs with secretion stimulated by food or histamine infusion activity on the central nervous system decrease of blood platelet adhesiveness in the case of PGE, as shown by platelet to glass adhesiveness, and inhibition of blood pla elet aquregation and thrombus formation induced by various physical stimuli, e.g. arterial injury, and various biochemical stimuli, e.g. ADP, ATP, serotonin, thrombin, and collagen, and in the case of the PGE and PGA compounds, stimulation of epidermal proliferation.and keratinization, as shown when they are applied in culture to embryonic chick and rat skin segments. Because of these bio ogical responses, these known prostaglandins are useful to study, prevent, control, or alleviate a wide variety of disease and undesirable physiological conditions in birds and mammals including humans, useful domestic animals, pets, and zoological specimens, and in laboratory animals, e.g. mice, rats, rabbits and monkeys. For example, these compounds are useful in mammals, including man, as nasal decongestants. For this purpose, the compounds are used in a dose range of about 0.01 mg to about 10 mg per ml of a pharmacologically suitable liquid vehicle or as an aerosol spray, both for topical application. PGA, PGFss and PGE compounds are useful as hypotensive agents to reduce blood pressure in mammals including man. For this purpose, the PGFB compounds are administered by intravenous infusion at the rate of about 0.01 mg to about 40 mg per Kg of body weight per minute, or in a single dosage or multiple doses of about 25 mg to 2500 mg per Kg of body weight total per day. The PGE and PGA compounds are administered by intravenous infusion at the rate of about 0.01 to about 50 mg per Kg of body weight per minute, or in a single dose or multiple doses of about 25 to 2500 mg per Kg of body weight total per day. The PGE, PGFX and PGFss compounds are useful in place of oxl ocin to induce labor in pregnant female animals, including humans, cows, sheep and pigs, at or near term or in pregnant animals with intrauterine death of the fetus from about 20 weeks to term. For t,his purpose, the PGF compound is infused intravenously at a dose of 0.01 mg to 50 mg per Kg of body weight per minute until or near the termination of the second stage of labor, i.e. expulsion of the fetus. Similarly, thePGE compound is infused intravenously at a dose of 0.01 to 50 mg per Kg of body weight per minute until or near the expulsion of the fetus.These compounds are especially useful when the female is one or more weeks postmature and natural labor, has not started, or 12 to 60 hours after the membranes have ruptured and natural labor has not yet started. The PGE, PGFK and PFGF compounds are useful for controlling the reproductive cycle in ovulating female mammals, including humans and other animals. For that purpose, PGF2 , for example, is administered systemically at a dose level in the range of 0.01 mg to about 20 mg per Kg of body weight, advantageously during a span of time starting approximately at the time of ovulation and ending approximately at the time of menses or just prior to menses. Likewise, a PGE compound is administered in the same fashion at a dose level of 0.01 mg to about 50 mg per Kg of body weight. Additionally, expulsion of an embryo or fetus is accomplished by similar ad,inistration of the compound during the first third or the second third of the normal mammalian gestation period.Accordingly, such co pounds are useful as abortifacients. They are also useful for induction of menses during approximately the first two weeks of a missed menstrual period and thus, are useful as contraceptive anti fertility agents. lla hydroxy PGE compounds are extremely potent in causing stimulation of smooth muscle, and are also highly active in potentiating other known smooth muscle stimulators, for example, oxytocic agents, e.g., oxytocin, and the various ergot alkaloids including derivatives and analogs thereof.Therefore PGE2, for example, is useful in place of or in co bination with less than usual amounts of these known smooth muscle stimulators for example, to relieve the symptoms of paralytic ileus, to control or prevent uterine bleeding after abortion or delivery, to aid in expulsion of the placenta, and during the puerperium. For the latter purpose, the PGE compound is administered by intravenous infusion immediately after abortion or delivery at a dose in the range about 0.01 to about 50 mg per Kg of body weight per minute until the desired effect is obtained.Subsequent doses are given by intravenous, subcutaneous, or intramuscular injection or infusion during puerperic in the range of 0.01 to 2 mg per Kg of body weight per day, the exact dose depending on the age, weight, and condition of the patient or animal. The novel PGA, PGE and PGFss of this invention are also useful as bronchodilators for the treatment of asthma and chronic bronchitis. As such they may be conveniently adminis tered by inhalation of aerosol sprays prepared in a dose range of about 10 g to about 10 mg ml of a pharmacologically suitabl liquid vehicle. Relative to the natural prostaglandins, the PGA and PGE compounds in particular have the significant advan tage of inducing prolonged effects. The PGE and PGA compounds are also useful in mammals, including man and certain useful animals, e.q., dogs and pigs, to reduce and control excessive gastric secretion, thereby re ducing or avoiding gastric erosion or gastrointestinal ulcer formation, and accelerating the healing of such ulcers already present in the gastrointestinal tract.For this purpose, the compounds are injected or infused intravenously, subcutaneously or intramuscularly in an infusion dose range of about 0.1 mg to about 500 mg per Kg of body weight per minute, or in a total daily dose by injection or infusion in the range of about 0.1 to about 20 mg per Kg of body weight per day, the exact dose depending on the age, weight, and condition of the patient or animal, and on the frequency and route of administration. These compounds may also be useful in conjunction with various non steroidal anti inflammatory agents, such as aspirin, phenylbutazone, indomethacin and the like, to minimize the well known ulcerogenic effects of the latter. The PGE and PGA compounds also stimulate epiderrnal proliferation and keratinization, and in such a capacity are useful to promote and accelerate healing of skin which has been damaged, for example, by burns, wounds, abrasions or surgery.The Vassopressor action of the PGA compounds makes them particularly useful in speeding the adherence and growth of skin autografts, especially small, deep navies grafts which are intend ed to cover sinless areas by subsequent outward growth rather than initially, and in retarding rejection of homografts. For these purposes, these compounds are preferably administered topically at or near the site where cell growth and keratin formation is desired, advantageously as an aerosol liquid or micronized powder spray, as an isotonic aqueous solu tion in the case of wet dressings, or as a lotion cream, or oint ment in combination with the usual pharamaceutically acceptable dilutents. In some instances, when there is substantial fluid loss as in the case of extensive burns or skin loss due to other causes, systemic aoministratin of PGE is advantageous, for example, by intravenous injection or infusion, separate or in combination with the usual infusions of blood, plasma, or substi tutes thereof.Alternative routes of administration are subcutaneous or intramuscular near the site, oral, sublingual, buccal rectal, or vaginal. The exact dose depends on such factors as the route of administration, and the age, weight, and condition of the subject. Illustrative of a wet dressing for topical application to second and or third degree burns of skin area 5 to 25 square centimeters is the use of an isotonic aqueous solution containing one to 500 mg ml of the PGA compound or several times that concentration of the PGE compound.Especially for topical use, these prostaglandins are useful in combination with antibiotics such as gentamycin, neomycin, polymyxin B, bacitracin, spectinomycin, and oxytetracycline with other antibacterials such as mafenide hydrochloride, sulfadiazine, furazolium chloride, and nitrofurazone and with corticoid steroids, such as hydrocortisone, prednizolone, methylprednisolone, and fluoroprednisolone each of those being used in the combination at the usual concentration suitable for i its use alone. The PGA compounds and derivatives and salts thereof increase the flow of blood in the mammalian kidney, thereby increasing the volume and electrolyte content of the urine. , For that reason, PGA compounds are useful in managing cases of renal disfunction, especially in cases of severely impaired renal blood flow, for example, the hepatorena syndrome and early kidney transplant rejection. In case of excessive or inappropriate antidiuretic hormone ADH vasopressin secretion, the diuretic effect of these compounds is even greater. In anephretic states, the vasopressin action of these compounds is especially useful. The PGE compounds of this invention are also useful as topical vasodilators. The PGE1 compounds of this invention are useful whenever it is desired to inhibit platelet aggregation, to reduce the adhesive character of platelets, and to remove or prevent the formation of thrombi in mammals including man, rabbits, and rats. For example, these compounds are useful to treat and prevent myocardial infarcts and post operative thrombosis.For these purposes, these compounds are administered systemically e.g., intravenously, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, and in the form of sterile implants for prolonged action. For rapid response, especially in emergency situations, the intra venous route of administration is preferred. Doses in the range of about 0.005 to about 20 mg per Kg of body weight per day are used, the exact dose depending on the age, weight, and condition of the patient or animal, and on the frequency and route of administration. It is well known that platelet aggregation inhibitors may be useful as anti thrombotic drugs. Inhibition of platelet aggregation can be conveniently measured in vitro by monitoring changes in optical density and or light transmission in platelet rich plasma upon addition of suitable aggregating agents such as adenosine diphosphate, epinephrine, thrombin or collagen. Alternatively, platelet aggregation can be measured in vitro using platelet rich plasma obtained at various time intervals fro animals given inhibitors by an oral or parenteral route. The PGE compounds of the present invention exhibit the ability to inhibit platelet aggr,egation in vitro when tested by the, following procedure. Human protein rich plasma is ,incubated with modified Tyrode s solution in a proportion of 40 50 human protein rich plasma. The test compounds are added at varying concentrations and after 5 minutes incubation an aggregating agent such as adanosine diphosphate or collagen is added. The change in oPtica 1 density light transmission is monitored by eye and inhbition is recorded as a or lack of inhibition is recorded as a Test compounds are considered active if they inhibit adenosine I diphosphate or collagen induced aggregation. at a concentration of 0.025 mg ml or less within 5 10 minutes. The PGE compounds of this invention also have broncho dilator activity as determined in a test using dogs anesthetized artificially ventilated and submitted to a continuous respi t ratory spasm induced by pilocarpine. z Mongrel dogs of either sex weighing between 5 and 10 kg are used. They are premedicated with morphine HCl by subcutaneous injection at 1.5 mg Kg. An intravenous perfusion of 5 W V chloralose is started 1 2 hour after the morphine injection in such a way that 60 mg Kg are administered within 15 minutes. After completion, a continuous perfusion of 10 mg Kg hour is maintained throughout the experiment. The dogs are artificially ventilated by means of a Starling pump at a rate of 20 breaths minute. The volume is adjusted according to the weight of the animal. Kleinman and Radford, J. Appl. Physiol., 19, 360 1964 . All the measurements are made with the dogs positioned supine in a heated, V shaped table. Curari ation is obtained by succinylcholine chloride usi injection of 3 mg Kg lasting 3 minutes, followed by a continu ous perfusion of 0.1 mg Kg minute. The respiratory spasm is induced by a starting injec tion of 400 g Kg of pilocarpine HCl lasting 5 minutes. An increase or decrease in the dose of pilocarpine HCl may occur as a function of the observed effect on the airway s resistance A 15 minute delay is observed before the start of a continuous perfusion of pilocarpine HCl at a dose of 4 ug Kg minute to maintain a constant spasm during the test. A metallic cannula is inserted and fixed, after tra cheotony, into the upper part of the trachea. The two cephalic veins and the two femoral veins are catheterized to inject various agents. The femoral artery is catheterized to measures the systemic blood pressure. An esophageal balloon 11 cm x 2.5 cm is inserted into the lower third of the oesophagus to measure the endothoracic pressure. The measurement of air flow is made with a Fleish pneumotachograph connected to the tracheal tube. The transpulmonary pressure is measured as follows The tracheal cannula is equipped with a stainless steel axial tube 1.5 mm which is closed at its dismal cnd and projected 2.5 cm beyond the end of the cannula. Three holes with a dia meter of one mm are pierced on this latter segment. This tube, which is used to measure the tracheal pressure, is connected to one of the two chambers of a Sanborn 267 B C differential transduce. The other chamber is connected to the esophageal ballon by means of a polyethylene catheter of the same length and characteristics as the balloon s. The airflow is measured from the Fleish pneumotacho graph by means of a Sanborn 270 differential transducer. The tidal volume is obtained by electronic integra tion of the flow signal using an R.C. integrator. The systemic and pulmonary blood pressures are gauged by means of a Sanborn 267 B C or 12803 pressure transducer. An electrocardiogram is taken in lead 2. Its use is to monitor a cardiac rate meter. All these parameters are recorded on a Sanborn polygraph. The transpulmonary pressure and the tidal volume are also displayed as rectangular coordinates on an oscilloscope. The airways resistance, expressed in cm of water liter second, is measured by subtracting from the electrical equivalent of the transpulmonary pressure, a voltage propor tional to the flow so as to synchronize the pressure and vol up signals on the oscilloscope Mead and Whittenberger, J. Appl.Physiol., 5,799 1953 . The value of the pulmonary elastance, expressed in cm of water liter, is obtained by means of the same principle, i.e., an electrical signal proportioned to the volume is subtracted from the transpulmonary pressure signal, in order to optimize the pressure flow loop on the oscilloscope. The details of this method are described by Lulling, et al. Med. Pharmacol. Exp., 16, 481 1967 . The computing operations ere carried out w ith an analogical computer which allows the direct reading, cycle to cycle, of the values of resistance and elastance. The test compounds are administered by sn Aerosol route The micronebulizer of a Bird Mark 7 respirator is fitted on the metallic cannula just after the pneumotachograph The puff of the test compound, in Aerosols is driven by a 2 Kg cm2 pressure, allowed into the micronebulizer just during one inspiration cycle. The micronebulizer is fitted on the respiratory tube only during the puff. It is weighed just before and just afeter administration to determine the amount of test compound administered. Approximately 50 mg of the solution is administered to each dog. In accordance with the Pilocarpine Assay described herein, the compounds of this invention should exhibit bronchodilator activity. The bronchodilator activity for representative compounds of this invention was determined in Guinea Pigs gainst bronchospasms elicited by intravenous injections of erotonin, histamine, and acetylcholine, by the Konzett proce ure the details of which are those discussed by J. Lulling, Lievens, F. El Sayed and J. Prignot, Arzeimittel Fdrschung 8, 995 1968 .

Flowsheet XEMI234.1 In accordance with Flowsheet X the prostaglandins of this invention containing the 9 methylene feature D are prepared starting with the corresponding carboxylic acid A the preparation of which has been described .L. Bundy, TetrahedJ Lett. 1957 1975 and G.L. Bundy, International Prostaclandln Conference, Washington, D.C. May 27 31, 1979 by the reaction of of A which at least three equivalents of dimethyl t butyl chlorosilane and imidazole in dimethylformamide to give B .The reaction of B with one equivalent of oxalyl chloride in the presence of a catalytic amount of dimethylformamide in methylene chloride or tetrahydrofuran gives the carboxylic and chloride C which can be converted to the desired compound D by one of two methods. The reaction of C with an etheral solution of diazomethane followed by hydrolysis of the resulting diazoketone using aqueous sulfuric acid and an ether solvent such as d iethylether, dioxane, or tetrahydrofuran at reflux gives the desired 9 methylene analogs D of this invention. Alternatively D can be prepared by the reaction of C with two equivalents of tris trimethylsilyloxyethylene either by heating the mixture neat or in chlorobenzene or by allowing the neat mixture to react in the presence of a Lewis acid such as stannic chloride in a mixture of dilute hydrochloric. acid and dioxane. The compounds of this invention containing a trans double bond between the C2 and C3 carbon atoms are prepared as illustrated in Flowsheet Y hereinbelow. Displacemn of the bromide atom of compound G with a thiophenoxide group is accomplished by the reaction of G with at least one equivalent of thiophenol and sodium ethoxide in ethanol. The less hindered carboxylate group can be hydrolized using one equivalent of sodium hydroxide in aqeuous ethanol to give H .Compound H is converted to the mixed anhydride by the reaction with trifluoracetic anhydride in methylene chloride. The reaction of this anhydride with furan then gives J . Hydrolysis of J with KOH in aqueous ethanol followed by reduction using sodium borohydride in ethanol gives alcohol K which on hydrolysis first in aqueous formic acid and then on aqueous sulfuric acid give compound L .The reaction of L with at least two equivalents of dimethyl t butylchlorosilane using imidazole and DMF followed by the reaction of the resulting bis silylated compound with one equivalent of oxalyl chloride in the presence of a catalytic amount of DMF then gives the acid chloride . The reaction of M with two equivalents of tris trimethylsilyloxyethylene followed by hydrolysis in a mixture of dilute hydrochloric acid and THF gives compound N which can be silylated using 1,1,1,3,3,3 hexamethyldisilazane and trimethylsolylchloride in pyridine to give 0 .The reaction of 0 with the cuprate reagent P followed by hydrolysis in acetic acid, H20, THF 4 1 2 gives compounds Q and R which can be separated by silica gel chromatography the reaction of Q with m chloroperbenzoic acid at 780C to OOC followed by isolation and thermolysis of the resulting sulfoxide gives compound S which is a subject of this invention.
