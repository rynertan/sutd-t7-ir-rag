# Wrapper for clothing.

## Abstract
A wrapper for clothing and the like includes a flexible member having a central area with a plurality of outwardly extending wing sections. A reinforcing base is provided in the central area. The wrapper also includes a shape retainer having the same geometric shape as the reinforcing member but being of a lesser dimension. Accordingly, articles of clothing may be folded around the shape retainer so that the articles are folded into the geometric shape, and the articles may then be placed on top of the base. The wing sections may then be folded over the articles to wrap the articles therein.
