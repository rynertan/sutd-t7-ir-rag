## Description
Flat, pressure resistant reservoir suitable for containing a material under pressure. The invention relates to a flat, pressure resistant reservoir of a rigid material and suitable for containing a material under pressure, and comprising means for supplying the material to, and for removing it from, the reservoir. Such a flat container is disclosed in German Offenlegungsschrift 1,946,410. This prior container is made of a synthetic plastics material and serves as a fuel reservoir for motor vehicles. The use of synthetic plastics material for making it indicates that the prior fuel reservoir is suitable for ordinary fuels, that is to say, those substantially liquid at ambient temperature and pressure, for example petrol. The object of the invention is a reservoir having such an increased pressure resistance that it is also suitable to be used for the storage of liquid gas used as motor fuel, the so called LPG. For this purpose, according to the invention, there is provided a reservoir of the kind mentioned in the opening paragraph, which is characterized in that the reservoir is made of a metal with the hollow profiles being formed by deep drawing, and the juxtaposed parts of the dished longitudinal halves are interconnected in a leak proof fashion by welding,the generators of the frusto conical profiles and the curved profile of the marginal zones of the dished longitudinal halves having the form of a auartercircle and, owing to the selected distribution pattern of the profiles over the central part of the dished halves, the interior of the reservoir is subdivided into interconnected spherical pockets, whereby, accordingly, in the fuel reservoir according to the invention, use is made of the insight that the spherical shape best meets the requirements in connection with pressure resistance, as is known per se. It is true that a substantially flat reservoir for the storage of liquefied gaseous motor fuel, the so called LPG, is known fromNetherlands patent application 77,03630. This prior reservoir, however, is limited in form and size to a construction that can be placed in the space of an automobile serving for a spare wheel.It will then be necessary to find another accommodation in the automobile for the spare wheel itself. With the constructional principle followed in the reservoir according to the invention, however, there are no restrictions as to any special shape or size. It will be clear that, in the case of a fuel reservoir for motor vehicles, such as a passenger automobile, in addition to the aim for as light a weight of the reservoir as possible, because this is of importance for an economical operation of the automobile, in the widest sense, the highest demands are imposed on its pressure resistance by reason of the direct vicinity of passengers in the automobile, while also the reservoir must be capable of meeting the varying conditions under which the reservoir is used in this case, for example, fluctuating ambient temperatures. It will be clear that a flat reservoir for liquefied gaseous motor fuel in automobiles makes possible a more useful arrangement of the space available for lukkage for example, by disposing the flat reservoir in a vertical position behind the rear seat, the loss of boot volume is minimized. Moreover, in this way, the weight of the reservoir is disposed approximately over the rear axle, which has a favourable effect on the way in which the rear axle is loaded. In a further advantageous embodiment of the reservoir according to the invention,accessto the spaces formed by the hollow deep drawn profiles is closed by covering the walls of the reservoir, which are parallel to the longitudinal median plane of the reservoir, with metal plates, and connecting these to the reservoir by welding all around. There is thus provided an additional space separated from the interior of the reservoir, and which, after being fitted with supply and discharge means, is suitable for use as an additional storage accommodation for liquid material that is not, or not substantially, under pressure. In the use of the reservoir according to the invention as a container for licuefied gaseous motor fuel, this additional storage accommodation can be used with advantage as a space for the storage of a stand by supply of petrol. The invention is illustrated with reference to the drawings, showing an embodiment of the reservoir according to the invention in which the interior is divided into spherical pockets. In said drawings, Fig. 1 is a perspective view showing a dished longitudinal half in the form of a rectangle with unequal sides, two of which are placed with the concave sides in contact with each other and welded together to form the reservoir Fig. 2 is an elevational view, partly broken away, of the reservoir according to the normal to the longitudinal median plane Fig. 3 is an elevational view, partly broken away, of the reservoir parallel to the longitudinal median plane in the direction of the longer side thereof Fig. 4 is an elevational view, partly broken away, of the reservoir parallel to the longitudinal median plane in the direction of the shorter side thereof and Fig. 5 is a view of the reservoir, similar to Fig. 3, covered on one of the two sides with a metal plate welded to the reservoir all around. In Fig. 1, 1 designates a dish made of a flat metal plate, with profiles 2 being provided by deep drawing, and edge 3 by bending. Profiles 2 have an open top 4. The curvature of the generator 5 of the deep drawn profiles 2 and the curvature 6 of the curved edge 3 are in the form of a quartercircle. Reservoir 7, shown in Figs. 2 4, is obtained by placing two dishes 1 with the concave sides in contact with each other, the dishes being interconnected by interconnecting profiles 2 pairwise along their contacting surfaces by welding, as designated by 8, and also along the peripheral edge as indicated at 9. As a result of the selected profile configurations 5 and 6, the interior of the reservoir is divided into spherical cavities as indicated, for example, by 10, in which cavities liquid gas is stored. If the reservoir 10 is covered on both sides by metal plates, as shown in Fig. 5 for one side of the reservoir by plate 11, a space 12 is formed, which can be used as an additional storage accommodation for liquids not substantially under pressure, or under low pressure, such as petrol. The means for supplying liquid gas to the reservoir and for the controlled discharge thereof from the reservoir are not shown, but may be of any conventional type, as neither are the supply and discharge means to be connected to the additional storage accommodation 10 for the liquid to be received therein, such as petrol, which may also be of any conventional type. Naturally, the reservoir as described hereinbefore and shown in the drawings can be changed without departing from the scope of the invention.
