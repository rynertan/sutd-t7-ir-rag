# Microprogrammable TDMA terminal controller.

## Abstract
A microprogrammable TDMA terminal controller is of modular construction. Frame reference and burst synchronization timing are resolved to the symbol level by a split frame counter, and a control RAM is reprogrammable on the fly to permit easy changes in terminal traffic assignments. The terminal controller includes a microprogrammed RAM controller 10 for performing real time burst and data path control functions, transmit and receive high speed data path modules 12, 14 for interfacing with the modem and terrestrial interface ports and providing direct burst processing of the data, a microcomputer based operation control 16 and a high stability oscillator 22 .
