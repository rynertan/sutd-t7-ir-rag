# Thick film conductor employing nickel oxide.

## Abstract
Printed circuits are made by depositing a conductor paste on an insulating substrate and heating the paste to render it conductive and adherent to the substrate. This invention provides improved pastes comprising 12 to 25 wt. boron, up to 35 wt. glass frit, and the balance being nickel oxide, the combined weight of glass frit and boron being 22 to 45 , all percentages being by weight on a dry basis. The pastes can satisfactorily be fired at 500 to 1100 C.
