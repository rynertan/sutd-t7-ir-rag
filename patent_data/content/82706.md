# Reel type slot machine.

## Abstract
A slot machine has a micro computer 25 comprising a look up table memory for storing information of symbol arrangements on reels 3,4,5 rotatably mounted side by side, respectively, and a memory for storing information as to the numbers of coins or token to be paid out according to predetermined prize winning combinations of symbols. When the reels are stopped, individually, the look up table memory is accessed with address signals indicating the stopped positions of the respective reels which are detected by counters associated therewith so as to determine the combination patterns of symbols which occur in prize awarding rows in such a way that all of the symbols read out from the look up table memory are compared with a respective one of said predetemined symbols read out one after another.
