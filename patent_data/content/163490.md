## Description
TREATMENT OF FEMALE HAIR LOSS The present invention relates to the treatment of scalp hair loss in women. This is a distressing condition which can affect women from puberty and which wit hout treatment generally progressively worsens, albeit with periods in which the patients condition remains stable. Because thinning hair is not a socially acceptable condition in women, as it may be in men after a certain age, the condition can cause, not merely distress, but severe psychological symptoms in women involving feelings of loss of femininity and self confidence, depression an inability to concentrate on anything except the prospect of impending baldness with mounting embarassment. The present invention provides a pharmaceutical formulation for use in treating female scalp hair loss which comprises cyproterone acetate a metabolite, analogue or derivative thereof and at least one oestrogen. Cyproterone acetate is an anti androgenic compound of the formula EMI1.1 17 alpha Acetoxy 6 chloro Thlpha, 2 alpha methylene pregna 4, 6 diene 3, 20 dione acetate conveniently referred to as CPA . It has been used previously in the treatment of men for control of libido in severe hypersexuality and has been proposed for use in treating precocious puberty. In addition, CPA has been used in combination with ethinyloestradiol eye , in clinical trials in women for the treatment of acne, hitsutism and virilism, as described in J. Hammerstein et al J.Steroid Biochem.1975. Vol 6 pp 827 836. The dose levels used in those trials were, however, adjusted in accordance with the patients responses in respect of acne, hirsutism and virilism. The predominant dosage used was lOOmg CPA given daily from day 5 until day 14, together with 50ug EE administered daily from day 5 until day 25 of the patient s cycle. The Hammerstein Article says that only rarely, it may become feasible to increase the dailyCPA dosage up to ZOOmg or to decrease the dosage to 50mg, but in general 100mg seems just the correct daily dose . Very mild cases of these disorders have been described as having been treated with 2mg CPA 50ug EE from day 5 until day 25 of the patient s cycle. A contraceptive having this composition was found to be largely ineffective in the treatment of moderate and severe acne vulgaris when taken over a period of six months Mugglestone C.J. Rhodes E.L. Clin. Exp. Dermatol. 1982. 7 593 598 . In the Article of Hammerstein et al reference is made to the effect of a CPA EE combination treatment on alopecia hair loss in women with androgen over production. A failure rate of 40 50 was reported after one year oftilerapy, although no numerical data are presented as to how the response to treatment was determined. A suggestion was made that the poor absorption rate of CPA was responsible for this lack of success, It was further suggested that researchers should seek better baianced preparations with no depot properties , but no guidance is given in the Article to how this balance may be achieved. Dawber et al. Br. J. Dermatol 1982 Vol. 107, Suppl 20, reported that 2mg CPA i 50ug EE daily for 21 consecutive days proved Inefectiv e in maintaining existing hair growth in women with androgenic alopecia. No further advances have apparently been made in this field since these Articles were published and the condition of androgenic alopecia in women is generally thought to be untreatable. It has now been found unexpectedly that not only can the process of androgenic alopecia in women be arrested, but also new hair growth can be stimulated, by the use of CPA at a dose level which exceeds a certain threshold value. Naturally, this threshold varies from patient to patient, but it has generally been found to be a monthly total of at least 125mg, and preferably 500mg. Dosages higher than 750mg oer month usually produce unwanted side effects and are not significantly more efficacious than the preferred dosage. In accordance with the present invention there is provided a pharmaceutical formulation for use in treating female scalp hair loss which comprises cyproterone acetate a metabolite, analogue or derivative thereof and at least one oestrogen, wherein when prepared in unit dosage form the formulation is adapted to administer at least 12Smg and not more than 750mg of cyproterone acetate per month. The invention further provides, in combination, a pharmaceutical formulation of the invention, a container therefor, and instructions for the use of the pharmaceutical formulation in the treatment of female scalp hair loss. The formulations of the present invention may be designed for oral or parenteral administration.Although the formulations could be for administration by injection, they will most conveniently be for oral administration, e.g. as tablets, capsules or solutions or suspensions. They may however be formulated as creams or lotions for topical administration or as injectable solutions or suspensions for subcutaneous injection, e.g. in the scalp, or for other forms of injection.They may generally be formulated for any of the known routes of pharmaceutical administration. Preferably, a formulation for oral administration will contain from 10 to 75mg, preferably about 50mg, of cyproterone acetate per unit dosage form, e.g. per tablet. The identity of the oestrogen used is not critical. Ethinyloestradiol is preferred. The oestrogen is present to provide a contraceptive effect since administration of cyproterone acetate during pregnancy would be highly undesirable. In addition, oestrogen has the beneficial effect or raising plasma sex hormone binding globulin SHBG levels thereby diminishing free biologically active testosterone and other androgen levels. A suitable dose rate for ethinyloestradiol would be 20 to 60ug per day orally, preferably about 40pug. The treatment of female scalp hair loss will preferably involve the administration of cyproterone acetate and the oestrogen in a cyclic manner. In the first part of cycle preferably both cyproterone acetate and oestrogen are administered This is followed preferably by treatment with oestrogen alone and then by no treatment to allow withdrawal bleeding.Preferably the cycle length is 28 days in accordance with normal contraceptive practice. A possible oral dosage regimen would therefore be Ethinyloestradiol 20 to 60 pg daily for 28 days of each cycleCyproterone acetate 10 to 75 mg daily for up to 27 days of the cycle or more preferably Ethinyloestradiol at 30 40 jig daily for the first 21 days of each cycle, andCyproterone acetate at about 50 m daily for the first 10 days of each cycle.The dosages most suitable for oestrogens other than ethinyloestradiol will be well known to practioners. Whilst the dosages of oestrogen and cyproterone acetate for administration on the same day may conveniently be formulated together as a formulation according to the invention, they can equally well be taken separately. In either case, it will be advantageous if the two different types of daily dose, namely oestrogen pluc cyproterone acetate or oestrogen alone are put up in a calendar pack as is the normal practice with contraceptive tablets. Optionally, tablets containing neither active ingredient dummy tablets may be provided for the days when neither ingredient is to be taken. Accordingly, the present invention provides a calendar pack containing pharmaceutical formulation doses for use in treating female scalp hair loss, comprising spaced locations corresponding to days of a menstrual cycle, dosage forms in a first series of said locations providing at each location of the series a daily dose of cyproterone acetate and a daily dose of an oestrogen in pharmaceutically administerable form and dosage forms at a second series of locations following the first series providing a daily dose of the oestrogen in pharmaceutically administerable form without cyproterone acetate, wherein the total dosage of cyproterone acetate in the pack is at least 125 mg and not more than 750 mg per cycle An example of such a pack would be a bubble pack of the conventional kind having a tablet of other dosage form contained in a bubble at each of a series of spaced locations, normally positioned in a closed loop running around the edge of the pack. The locations may be numbered, normally 1 to 28. A first series of bubbles may contain either one tablet or other dosage form containing both active ingredients or a pair of tablets or other dosage forms, one containing oestrogen and the other cyproterone acetate. Where two dosage forms are provided they may of course be put in separate bubbles at the same day s location. The first series of bubbles will preferably correspond to up to the first 27 days, e.g. the first 10 days of a 28 day cycle. The second series of bubbles may then contain only one dosage form per location containing oestrogen but not cyproterone acetate. The second series may comprise enough locations to bring the user to about the 21st day of a cycle. If further bubbles are provided, they may be empty so that they can simply be burst in turn to mark a day s passing or may contain a dosage form containing neither active ingredient. An example of a tablet formulation according to the present invention would, for instance, be 40mug ethinyloestradiol 70.Omg lactose 50mg cyproterone acetate 94.Omg corn starch lOmg talcum 3.2mg gelatin 2.8mg magnesium stearate It has been found that treatment as described above results in decreased hair fall, increased hair density, an increase in hairs of more than 40um in diameter in the frontal area of the scalp and occipital area also, as well as a decrease in the greasiness of the hair. Various courses of treatment and their effects are described in the following clinical examples in which reference is made to the accompanying drawings. In these drawings Figure 1 shows frontal area trichogram changes in an untreated control group of women and a group receiving treatment.Total hair density THD normal range 234 345 hairs cm2 is indicated by open bars meaningful hair density MHD normal range 193 290 hairs greater than 40um in diameter cm2 by vertical lined bars, with the Mean s.e. being shown.Figures 2a and 2b show frontal area trichogram changes in total hair density THD and meaningful hair density MHD , respectively, during treatment expressed as a percentage improvement on basal values. The mean line is also shown Figure 3 shows occipital area trichogram changes in the control and treatment groups as in Figure 1.Normal total hair density THD is 233 352 hairs cm2 and meaningful hair density MHD 198 310 hairs greater than 40 m in diameter cm2. Figures 4a and 4b show occipital area trichogram changes as in Figures 2a and 2b, respectively.Figure 5 shows the effect of dose variation on the frontal area trichogram after 12 months of cyproterone acetate CPA 500mg month during treatment. Total hair density CTHD is indicated by open bars, meaningful hair density MHD by vertical lined bars. Patient aged 26 years with hair loss for 2 years prior to treatment. No family history .Figure 6 shows the effect of dose variation on the frontal area trichogram after 24 months of cyproterone acetate CPA 500mg month during treatment. Total hair density THD is indicated by open bars meaningful hair density by vertical lined bars. Patient aged 36 years with hair loss for 23 years prior to treatment. Family history . It has beenfound that it is possible that patients treated with cyclical anti androgen therapy administered systemically as described may unexpectedly benefit further from the addition of topical preparations applied directly to the scalp. Therefore, it is proposed that the addition of topical preparations as described may enhance the effects of systemic preparations leading to the possible reduction in the dose of either the topical or systemic preparations to produce a synergistic therapeutic effect. For this reason it may be possible for the lower limits of the doses described previously to be reduced while maintaining the effectiveness of the preparations systemic and topical in the arrest and reversal of the common baldness process. Such a combination of therapy would be of considerable practical clinical value in allowing the minimum effective dose of treatment to be used. CLINICAL EAMPLESThirteen women aged between 18 37 years with a history of baldness diffuse androgenic alopecia genetic hair loss for 2 23 years and continued hair loss were treated with cyclical antiandrogen therapy CAT for up to 30 months. Seven women aged between 24 and 43 years with a history of scalp fair loss for 6 to 18 years and a family history in 3 acted as controls and remained untreated for six months. Three of them, one with a family history, subsequently entered the treatment group. Their data at the end of six months control period are included in the time 0 grouped results. One patient was treated for six months and two for twelve months. The treatment group received CAT comprising cyproterone acetate 50mg daily for 10 days following the period combined with ethinyl oestradiol 40 g daily for 21 days following the period repeated cyclically allowing 5 7 days for withdrawal bleeds. Two patients aged 26 and 36 years and a history of hair loss of 2 and 23 years, with a family history in the latter, received the standard treatment regimen for 12 months in the case of the younger patient Fig 5 and for 24 months in the elder patient Fig 6 . At this stage the total ariount of cyproterone acetate given in equal doses over 10 days month was reduced from SOOrrg i.e. 10 x 50mg to 252rg i.e. 10 x 25mg or 125mg i.e. 5 x 25mg alternate days per month. The dose of ethinyl oestradiol 840 g month was unchanged. The ingredients were taken individually or combined in powdered form in gelatin capsules. Total hair density THD . individual fibre diameter and meaningful hair density MHD hairs greater than 40 m in diameter cm2 were compared with values obtained previously in 10 normal women in whom unit area trichograms had been performed. The assessment of androgen dependent alopecia using the unit area trichogram technique is described in general in Rushton H., James K.C., Mortimer C.H. British Journal of Dermatology, 1983 109, 429 437.All trichograms were performed follag the same standardised procedure prior to sapling. This involved washing the hair in the morning of the first day day 1 , followed by combing tile hair four times morning, midday, aftenoon and evening The combing regimen was repeated on day 2. On day 3, the hair was combed in the morning and 2 hours later the hair saaples were taken. Hairs were plucked from the frontal area 10 30mm right of the midline and 35 55mn from the frontal periphery. The occipital site was plucked 0 30mm to the right of the midline and 70 llOmm from the occipital periphery, while in two patients the vertex area was sarrpled also. For each trichogram the midline was defined as that extending fran the nose to the occipital protuberance. The precise dimensions of the plucked area were determined by Macro 1 1 photography using a Canon Fln camera. The frontal, occipital and vertex area was defined by marking the scalp through a rigid template with a felt tipped pen.All the hairs within and on the marked line were removed singly in the direction of hair growth. The frontal area sarrpled varied between 32 38mm2 due to the type of felt tipped pen enployed. Repeated measurement of the same sites by two independent observers produced a maximum variation in area recorded of less than 8 . There was To observer differenoe between the total nutter of hairs plucked and thus the density measurement of the technique is considered to be accurate to within 88. The unit area trichogram was performed before and after six months without treatment in the control group and at six monthly intervals during CAT.In the control group of seven patients total frontal hair density basally ranged between 69 206, mean 149 s.e. 18 hairs cm2 normal range 234 345 hairs cm2 and showed To significant change after six months, 65 94, mean 139 s.e. 16 hairs cm2.Meaningful hair density also showed no significant change fran 58 167, mean 111 s.e. 14 hairs cm2 basally normal range 193 290 hairs greater than 40 m in diameter cm2 to 65 162, mean 108 s.e. 12 hairs cm2 after six nrrrths. In contrast, duringCAT there was an increase in both total hair and meaningful hair density.All eight patients who were measured at six months showed a significant increase P 0.01 in total hair density from 98 194, mean 142 F s.e. 10 hairs cm2 basally to 132 264 mean 173 s.e. 13 hairs cm2, an increase in total hair density of 4 36 on basal values at six months. After 12 months there was a further increase in total hair density in all 13 patients from basal values of 98 218, mean 146 s.e. 9 to 173 280, mean 197 s.e. 9 hairs cm2 P 0.001 and to 168 244, mean 202 s.e. 11 hairs cm2 after 18 months of treatment P 0.01 . This represented an increase in total hair density in the group between 26 718 on basal total hair density during CAT. Basal meaningful hair density ranged between 65 182, mean 103 s.e. 9 hairs an . After six months of treatment five of the eight patients showed a significant increase P 0.02 in meaningful hair density from, 65 162, mean 99 s.e. 9 basally to 91 193, mean 122 s.e. 13 hairs cm2. After 12 months there was a clear increase in meaningful hair density in all 13 patients to 105 227, mean 145 s.e. 11 hairs cm2 P 0.001 and 105 208, mean 143 s.e. 12 hairs cm2 after 18 months P 0.02 . This represented an increase in meaningful hair density between 15 928 on basal values during CAT.These results are shown in Figures 1, 2a, 2b.In the control group of seven patients, five had occipital area trichograms performed. Total hair density basally ranged between 159 211, mean 184 s.e. 9 hairs cmar2 normal range 233 352 hairs cm2 and showed no significant change after six months 139 200, mean 174 s.e. 10. Meaningful hair density also showed no significant change from 113 160, mean 143 s.e. 9 hairs cm2 basally normal range 198 310 hairs greater than 40 m in diameter cm2 to 107 167, mean 137 s.e. 10 hairs cm2 at six months. During CAT four patients showed an increase in total hair density, from 144 264 basally to 196 283 hairs cm2 at 6 months, While in one there was no significant difference at 6 or 12 months. The remaining 9 patients at 12 months had increased total hair density fram 141 276 basally mean 188 s.e. 12 hairs cm2 to 178 293, mean 222 s.e. 13 hair cm2. After 18 months the previously unresponsive patient bad an increase in total hair density tran 183 basally to 222 hairs cm2. These changes represented a significant increase p 0.01 in total hair density in the group and a 21 56 improvement over basal values during CAT. Three patients snowed a marked increase in meaningful hair density fran 118 221 basally to 152 233 hairs cm2 at six months, althougn two remained unchanged. After 12 months one patient as with total hair density showed no significant change.However, the remaining 9 patients had a significant increase in meaningful hair density from 113 221 hairs cm2 basally, mean 145 s.e. 10 hairs cm2 to 132 233, mean 182 s.e. 12 hairs cm2 P 0.001 . After 18 months the previously unresponsive patient had an increase in meaningful hair density from 113 basally to 144 hairs cm2 . The changes in the group as a whole represented an increase in meaningful hair density between 10 54 on basal values during CAT. These results are summarised in Figures 3, 4a, 4b. in two patients, the nost severely affected area Of hair loss was at the vertex, and hair density changes were followed during CAT over 12 18 months. 30th patients snowed an increase in total hair density at the vertex fran 111 to 144 basally to 124 or 148 at 12 months with a further increase to 200 hairs cm2 in the latter at 18 months. Meaningful hair density also increased, from 73 or 114 to 124 or 137 at 12 months and to 173 hairs cm2 in the latter at 18 mcnths. Normal data for the vertex area are not yet available. Two women who achieved increases in both frontal total hair density and meaningful hair density at 6 and 12 months while receiving the standard treatment regimen were selected to assess the effects of dose variation. After twelve months, the cyproterone acetate dose in one patient was reduced from 500mg month standard to 250mg month for a further twelve months. Total hair density oontinued to increase from 147, basally, to 202 hairs , while the meaningful hair density proved from 111, basally to 173 hairs cm2 at 24 months.However, when the total dose of cyproterone acetate was further reduced to 125mg month over the next six months the patient noted an increase in hair fall within three months and there was a reduction in total hair density from 202 to 171 hairs cm2 and meaningful hair density from 173 to 131 hairs cm2. The decrease in hair density was clinically obvious. These results are shown in Fig. S.In the second patient the standard treatment regimen was continued for two years during which time total hair density increased from 98, basally, to 168 hairs cm2 and meaningful hair density from 65, basally, to 125 hairs cm2. When the dose of cyproterone acetate was reduced to 250mg month for 6 months total hair density fell fran 168 to 139 hairs cm and the meaningful hair density from 125 to 113 hairs cm2. The patient herself was uncertain as to whether there had been a deterioration although this had been suggested by her mother. This was the impression clinically. These results are shewn in Fig. 6.During treatment all patients remarked on the reduction of scalp and hair greasiness within 3 6 weeks except one patient Fig. 6 who had a consistently normal dry scalp . All noted a reduction in hair fall during combing or washing after 2 3 months. The new hair was of the same colour as that of the patients existing hair. The treatnnent combination proved to be contraceptive with no pregnancies recorded. Withdrawal bleeds ocurred regularly including six patients with previously irregular cycles. Mild facial acne cleared in 3 patients by 3 8 weeks, although mild facial hirsuties remained unchanged in one patient after 18 months. One patient Indian noted a slight increase in skin pigmentation around The cheeks similar to chloasma. After stopping CAT in order to become pregnant, the pignentation faded, only to reappear 6 months later when the patient was 6 weeks pregnant. All patients reported a general improvement in confidence as the increase in hair density became clinically observable. One patient Fig. 5 , with severe depression, agoraphooia and anxiety associated with her hair loss prior to therapy, recovered completely without the need for psychotropic drugs. All patients at some stage noted an increase in breast size, although this was persistent and occasionally painful in only one patient. The breasts were otherwise nornal. Weight increase was recorded In 5 patients 2 3.5kg undhanged in 7 and reduoed in one ty 3.5kg. Blood pressure was not significantly changed and cervical smears after 12 24 months of treatment remained normal. There was no significant change in haematalogy, liver function or renal function tests. Further clinical details relating to these studies will be reported in part, including endocrine analyses in Mortimer C.H., Rusnton H., Jams K.C. Clin. Tbrp. Derrtatol 1984, c7 342 350 Statistical levels of significance were determined by the use of Students t test and ly Sandler s A statistic. 3. Additional information regarding an unexpected beneficial effect upon sYstemically administered Cyproterone Acetate Oestrogen by the application of topical preparations It has been found that it is possible that patients treated with cyclical anti androgen therapy administered systemically as described in the Invention may unexpectedly benefit further from the addition of topical preparations applied directly to the scalp.

Typically patients have reported that prior to the addition of the topical preparations they would normally cut their hair eadh 2 3 ronths to maintain the same style.
