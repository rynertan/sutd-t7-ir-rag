# A descender.

## Abstract
A descender for use when abseiling down a rope, the descender including a self acting brake mechanism, which will slow the rate of descent unless the brake is held in the release position. The descender has a fixed braking surface and a pair of sheaves mounted on a support member which is pivotable about an axis passing through a lower one of the sheaves such that a rope passing around the lower sheave, between the two sheaves, around the upper sheave and finally between the upper sheave and the braking surface, will cause the pivotable member to be pivoted to press the rope between the upper sheave and the braking surface when a tension is applied to the upper end of the rope. The descender is also provided with a handle to reduce the braking force by pivoting the upper sheave away from the braking surface and a retaining plate pivotable between a position in which a rope is retained in the descender and a position in which the rope is able to be inserted into and removed from the descender.
