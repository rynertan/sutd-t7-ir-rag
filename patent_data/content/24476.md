# Improvements relating to line scan circuits for cathode ray tube displays.

## Abstract
A line scan circuit for a cathode ray tube display includes a phase detector 3 , integrator 4 , voltage controlled oscil lator 5 and line output stage 6 . The integrator, voltage controlled oscillator and line output stage are conventional but the phase detector is novel. The phase detector compares the phase difference for both the leading and trailing edges of the horizontal synchronization pulses and the line flyback pulses. This forces the line flyback pulses to be centred with respect to the synchronization pulses resulting in improved centring and linearity of the displayed picture.
