# REGISTER CONTROL SYSTEM FOR A PRINTING PRESS

## Abstract
Optical scanners 18, 19 mount to a press 1 to 8 and provide information to a register control system 15, 16, 17, 20 which automatically maintains color to color register. The same information is processed to provide signals to a scanner interface circuit 17 which controls the position of the optical scanners 18, 19 to insure that they track the register patterns on the moving web 6 .
