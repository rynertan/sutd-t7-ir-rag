# Method for making overhead projection transparency and transparency assemblies.

## Abstract
The present invention provides a method for making over head projection transparencies. According to the invention there is arranged a first web 1 of a thin transparent plastic film on a second web 2 of paper, said first web 1 being at tached along one longitudinal edge thereof by means of a line of adhesive 3 , the upper face of the first web having a writable surface and the lower face thereof having a non writable sur face. In the longitudinal direction of the webs on first B of two sections of said writable surface of the first web 1 infor mation may be written, e.g. in the form of diagrams, text etc. to be shown by overhead projection, while leaving the second section A blank. Thereafter the second web 2 or parts thereof 5, 8, 9 are removed from the first web, whereafter the assembly of the first web 1 and the possible remainder 6 of the second web is folded such that the writable surfaces of the said two sections face each other, said writable surfaces being heat weldable to each other, after which the said assembly is fed through a heat sealing means to weld the said two sections together to produce the overhead transparency. The first and second webs may be provided as a continu ous form, the second web having marginal edges with feeding holes for engagement with a feeding mechanism of a data printer or data drawing machine, suitable providing multicolour information on the said writable surface.
