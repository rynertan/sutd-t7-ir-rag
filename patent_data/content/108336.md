# High frequency x ray generator power supply.

## Abstract
A resonant dc dc converter employing power transistors as the switching elements generates a high dc output voltage 150 kilovolts to drive an x ray tube. The converter is configured such that the resonating circuit elements can be realized using the transformer parasitic elements. Voltage step up is achieved due to the transformer turns ratio as well as the resonant rise of voltage across the energy storage elements of a series resonant circuit.
