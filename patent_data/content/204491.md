# GAS FILTER

## Abstract
A filter for noxious gases such as sulphur dioxide or nitrogen dioxide comprises a keratinous fibre substrate within which is deposited an effective amount of manganese dioxide. The fibres, preferably sheep s wool, may be in the form of a fibrous bat and the manganese dioxide is deposited from acidified permanganate solution. The filter is most effective when maintained in the wet state.
