# Method of recovering uranium.

## Abstract
A method of recovering uranium from an aqueous calcium fluoride slurry is disclosed. The pH of the slurry is first adjusted to between 2 and 3 using an acid such as nitric acid. The supernatant fluid is then separated from the remainder of the slurry, as for example, by permitting the slurry to settle for several days. Finally, the uranium is removed from the supernatant fluid which can be accom plished by using an ion exchange column or by precipitation with water glass. The steps of the invention can be repeated on the remaining slurry to reduce the uranium level as desired.

## Description
METHOD OF RECOVERING URANIUM This invention relates to recovering uranium from an aqueous calcium fluoride slurry. In an ammonium diuranate conversion process for preparing uranium oxide powder, a waste stream is produced which contains uranium, fluoride, ammonium, and nitrate ions. To recover the ammonia and lower the fluoride levels, a calcium hydroxide or lime slurry is added which precipitates calcium fluoride. The ammonium diuranate ADU waste stream is processed in an ammonia stripping column, and the calcium fluoride slurry which is produced is sent to a settling lagoon where excess water is decanted and run off. Some of the uranium remains in the calcium fluoride slurry as insoluble calcium uranate. This calcium uranate waste not only creates an expensive disposal problem but also represents a loss of a valuable resource.While other processes, such as that disclosed in JapanesePatent 48 38320, can be used to remove some of the uranium from the waste stream prior to the precipitation of the calcium fluoride, these processes are of no use in recovering the uranium which is present in most already exist .ng ponds of calcium fluoride slurry. Accordingly, the present invention resides in a method of recovering uranium from an aqueous calcium fluoride slurry which comprises A adjusting the pH of said slurry to between 2 and 3 B separating the supernatant fluid from said slurry and C removing uranium from said supernatant fluid. We have discovered a simple method for recovering uranium from a calcium fluoride slurry. Our process is reasonably inexpensive to operate and requires only very small amounts of capital for items such as pumps and perhaps an extra pond. Furthermore, the uranium concentration in a calcium fluoride slurry can be reduced to a sufficiently low level to enable the slurry to be disposed of as a chemical waste, rather than as a nuclear waste. The uranium product, moreover, is compatible with the widely used uranium diuranate process and can be added directly to those processes In order that the invention can be more clearly understood, a convenient embodiment thereof will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawing which is a block diagram of a method of recovering uranium. Referring to the drawing, a calcium fluoride slurry in pond 1 is forced by pump 2 past valve 3 through line 4 to which is added nitric acid and water from line 5 which reduces the pH of the slurry to between about 2 and about 3. After mixing in tank 6, the calcium settling agent in line 7 is added to the slurry in line 8. The slurry proceeds through valve 9 to second settling pond 10. After settling, the supernatant fluid, which contains uranium, is removed with pump 11 through line 12 and valve 13 to a uranium removal process The calcium fluoride slurry in pond 10 is forced by pump 14 through line 15 and valve 3 into line 4 where additional water is added in line 5 and, if necessary, nitric acid. After mixing in tank 6, the slurry passes through line 8, valve 9, and line 16 back to pond 1.After settling in pond 1, the supernatant is removed with pump 11 through line 12 and valve 13. The initial calcium fluoride slurry may contain about 1 to about 10 percent all percentages herein are by weight solids, of which at least 0.5 to 9.5 percent is calcium fluoride, and the rest is water, and from 1 to 1000 parts per million ppm uranium, usually in the form of some type of calcium uranate. A typical settled calcium fluoride slurry contains from 20 to 40 percent by weight solids and may contain any amount of uranium but typically it is from 150 to 200 ppm. It is preferable to dilute the slurry with water to from 5 to 10 percent solids as this enables one to get the most uranium out of the slurry while producing the least amount of liquid which must be treated with water glass to remove the uranium.This slurry should have less than a hundred ppm of iron present because the iron is dissolved with the uranium and would contaminate in the subsequent process.Generally, the invention will work with any liquid slurry of calcium fluoride which contains an insoluble uranium compound. The uranium in these slurries may be enriched in uranium 235, making it particularly valuable. In the first step of this invention, the pH of the slurry is adjusted to from 2 to 3. If the pH is less than 2, the calcium fluoride begins to dissolve and if the pH is greater than 3, the uranium will not be solubilized.This pH adjustment may be performed with any acid that forms a soluble calcium and uranium compound such as hydrochloric or nitric acid. Nitric acid is preferred as it is compatible with the uranium recovery system on anADU uranium dioxide powder plant. Any strength nitric acid may be used for this purpose. The nitric acid dissolves the insoluble calcium uranate, for example, according to the equation CaU2O7 6HN03 2U02 N03 2 Ca N03 2 3H2 0. After the uranium has been solubilized, it is preferable to add a calcium settling agent, a compound which does not affect the pH but which forms an insoluble compound with calcium, thereby reducing the amount of calcium in solution. The calcium settling agent does not precipitate the uranium because once the soluble calcium uranate compound is formed, it is fairly stable. Sodium sulfate, sodium carbonate, carbon dioxide gas, or other suitable compounds can be used as calcium settling agents, but the preferred settling agent is sodium sulfate because it is inexpensive. The amount of calcium settling agent is preferably from 0.01 to 0.50 percent. In the next step of the process of this invention, it is necessary to separate the supernatant liquid from the remainder of these calcium fluoride slurries.This can most advantageously be accomplished by permitting the slurry to settle, so that the supernatant can be pumped off the top of the slurry. Typically, a slurry will settle adequately within from 2 to 8 days. In the next step of the invention, the uranium is removed from the supernatant liquid. This can be accomplished for example by using an ion exchange column as is well known in the art. However, while an ion exchange column will work if hydrochloric acid was used for the pH adjustment, it is not suitable if nitric acid was used. If the pH adjustment was made with nitric acid, it is preferable to use water glass sodium silicate to remove the uranium from the supernatant liquid. The recovery of uranium by the use of water glass is described in Japanese Patent 48 38320, herein incorporated by reference. After the uranium has been removed from the supernatant liquid, the remaining fluid can be discarded. The remaining calcium fluoride sludge can then be repeatedly subjected to the process of this invention to reduce the uranium to the desired concentration. That is, water is added to the sludge to dilute it preferably to from 5 to 10 percent solids, the pH is adjusted, if necessary, to from 2 to 3 though probably no pE ad,ustment will be necessary , the sludge is permitted to settle, the supernatant is removed, and the uranium is removed from the supernatant liquid. The process is repeated either until the uranium concentration is low enough so that the sludge can be disposed of as non nuclear waste or until the uranium is too low for economic recovery, which typically requires from 4 to 7 repetitions. After the sludge has been completely processed, it is preferably disposed of by bringing its pH up to from 9 to 10 using calcium hydroxide or other alkali. Cement is then added which sets up and forms an immobile solid which can be used as fill. The invention will now be illustrated with reference to the following Example EXAMPLE One hundred milliliters of 3 percent by weight w o calcium fluoride in water, containing 180 mg Q of uranium, was mixed with 300 ml of water containing 3 ml of 69 w o nitric acid and 0.5 grams of sodium sulfate. This slurry was allowed to settle for twenty four hours. The supernatant 224 ml was decanted, analyzed, and found to contain 37 mg t of uranium. The remaining slurry was remixed with 22e ml of water and again allowed to settle for 24 hours. The supernatant 268 ml was decanted and found to contain about 21 mg Q of uranium. This procedure was repeated for three more cycles for which the following results were obtained. Uranium In Supernatant Water Added 14.5 mg Q 243 ml 7.8 mg Q 28 ml 5.2 mg Q Final Sludge Volume was 180 ml These results indicate that uranium level in the calcium fluoride sludge can be reduced to 5.2 mg t in about five cycles. While various levels of nitric acid and sodium sulfate can be used in the process of this invention, the levels reported in this example have provided the best uranium recovery with the lowest use of reagents.
