## Description
TREATMENT OF ZEOLITES This invention relates to the treatment of zeolites to enhance their activity. High silica zeolites are well known in the art and it is generally accepted that the ion exchange capacity of a crystalline aluminosilicate is directly dependent upon its aluminum content. Thus, for example, the more aluminum there is in a crystalline structure, the more cations are required to balance the electronegativity thereof, and when such cations are of the acidic type such as hydrogen, they impart high catalytic activity to the crystalline material. On the other hand, high silica zeolites having little or substantially no aluminum have many important properties and characteristics and a high degree of structural stability and have become candidates for use in various processes including catalytic processes.Materials of this type are known in the art and include high silica containing aluminosilicates such asZSM 5 US A 3,702,886 , ZSM 11 US A 3,709,979 , and zeolite ZSM 12 US A 3,832,449 to mention a few. The silica to alumina ratio of a given zeolite is often variable for example, zeolite X can be synthesized with silica to alumina ratio of from 2 to 3 zeolite Y from 3 to about 6. In some zeolites, the upper limit of silica to alumina ratio was unbounded. ZSM 5 is one such example wherein the silica to alumina ratio is at least 5. US A 3,941,871 discloses a crystalline metal organosilicate essentially free of aluminum and exhibiting an X ray diffraction pattern characteristic of ZSM 5 type aluminosilicates. US A 4,061,724 4,073,865 and 4,104,294 describe microporous crystalline silicas or organosilicates wherein the aluminum content present is at impurity levels. Because of the extremely low aluminum content of these silica containing zeolites, their ion exchange capacity is not as great as materials with a higher aluminum content. Therefore, when these materials are contacted with an acidic solution and thereafter are processed in a conventional manner, they are not as catalytically active as their higher aluminum containing counterparts. This invention permits the preparation of high silica containing materials which have all the desirable properties inherently possessed by such high silica materials yet have an acid activity which heretofore has only been manifested by materials having a higher aluminum content. This invention is concerned with the treatment of high silica zeolites, namely those of silica toalumina ratio greater than 500, preferably greater than 1000, and including those highly siliceous materials where the silica to alumina ratio is inifinity or as reasonably close to infinity as practically possible.This latter group of highly siliceous materials is exemplified by US A 3,941,871, 4,061,724, 4,073,865, 4,104,294wherein the materials are prepared from reaction solutions which involve no deliberate addition of aluminum. However, trace quantities of aluminum are usually present due to the impurity of the reaction solutions. It is to be understood that the invention includes those materials which have other metals besides silica and or alumina associated therewith, such as boron, iron and chromium, etc. Thus, the only requirement with regard to the starting materials utilized in a novel process of this invention, is that they have a silica to alumina ratio greater than about 500, irrespective of what other materials or metals are present in the crystal structure. They usually have a constraint index in the range 1 to 12.The particularly preferred starting materials for the novel process of this invention are those crystalline materials which have an X ray diffraction pattern characteristic of ZSM 5, ZSM 11, andZSM 12 irrespective of their chemicat composition other than the minimum silica to alumina ratio. The preferred starting material for the novel process of this invention is a high silica containing ZSM 5. The invention is simple in nature and easy to carry out, although the results obtained are dramatic. The invention is carried out simply by contacting a hTgh silica zeolite either as crystallized or after calcination with an ammoniacal alkali metal aluminate solution, preferably an ammoniacal sodium aluminate solution, at a pH of about 8 to 14, preferably a pH greater than 10.A particularly preferred technique involves contacting the zeolite with the ammoniacal alkali metal aluminate solution by vacuum impregnation. The amount of solution utilized to treat the zeolite is not narrowly critical and the solution to zeolite ratio can vary from 0.3 to 10 grams of solution per gram of zeolite. The amount of solution will vary as a function of its concentration and the desired enhancement of activity. The process is carried out by treating the zeolite with the above described solution at temperatures ranging from 20 to 500C, preferably from 20 to 350C, for periods of time ranging from 20 minutes to 30 days, preferably from 1 2 hour to 5 days. Following the above treatment, the zeolite is processed into its catalytically active form by conventional techniques, such as base exchange with appropriate cations such as hydrogen, ammonium, rare earth, and mixtures thereof. The zeolite may then be calcined by heating to a temperature in the range of t00 6000C in an atmosphere such as air, nitrogen, etc. at atmospheric, subatmospheric, or superatmospheric pressures for between 1 and 48 hours. The zeolite can, if desired, be incorporated in a matrix by techniques well known in the art.Conventional matrices include inorganic oxides, such as silica, alumina, silica alumina, etc. The following examples will illustrate the novel process of this invention. EXAMPLE 1 A 2 g. sample of ZSM 5 zeolite having a silicato alumina ratio of about 26,000 and a sodium content of about 0.23 weight percent was impregnated with 3 grams of 5 weight percent sodium aluminate solution and cal caned in air at 5380C for 20 hours. EXAMPLE 2 The product of Example 1 was treated with a 1 N 8 weight percent solution of ammonium nitrate. EXAMPLE 3 A sample of the same ZSM 5 used above was vacuum impregnated with a solution of sodium aluminate which was diluted by an equal volume of concentrated 12N NH4OH. The pH was 12.4. After 30 minutes, the sample was dried and submitted to three cycles of 1N NH4N03 treatment followed by hot water washing. The sample was dried and calcined at 5380C prior to testing. The products of Examples 1 3 were evaluated for alpha activity. The Alpha test is described in Journal of Catalysis, Vol. 4, pp. 522 529, August 1965. The results are shown in the following table Table 1 Activity of High SiO2 ZSM 5 After Treatment Example Alpha 1 NaAlO2 treat 0.4 2 NaAlO2 NH4N03 treat 0.2 3 NaAlO2 NH40H imp 12 NH4N03 treat From the above table, it can be seen that the novel process of this invention resulted in a dramatic increase of activity. The procedure of Examples 1 and 2 did not result in any significant improvement, whereas the process of this invention Example 3 did enhance activity.
