# Fluorinated phenolic polymer and process for its preparation.

## Abstract
Fluorinated phenolic polymer, process for its prepara tion, and use thereof, particularly in the form of a film as a membrane in an electrolytic cell, said polymer consisting essentially of recurring units of 1 CFâ‚‚CFX wherein X in each of the recurring units is independently selected from F, Cl, R and OR wherein R ist perfluoroalkyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms and
