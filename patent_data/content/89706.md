# Motor vehicle with its body in the form of a volumetric shell of resilient material.

## Abstract
A motor vehicle of which the shell 1 is entirely constructed of resilient impact resistant material configured into a structure of integrated volumes which is fitted on to a load bearing 2 base comprising all the mechanical mem bers. The proposed vehicle is composed of a lower body portion or frame 2 to which the wheels and transmission and control members are connected, on which there is a structure formed from one or more blocks or sheets of resilient material, configured as volumes which harmonically blend the outer shape and the passenger compartments into a unified combination.
