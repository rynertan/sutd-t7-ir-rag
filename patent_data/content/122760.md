# Baby carriage.

## Abstract
A structure for the connecting sections of a baby carriage between a pair of push rods 1 and a push rod connecting rod 2 which allows the widening and narrowing of the distance between the pair of push rod 1 in response to opening and closing operations on the baby carriage. The distance be tween the pair of push rods 1 , when it is widened, is firmly maintained in that the connecting sections between the push rods 1 and the push rod connecting rod 2 are locked. This locking of each connecting section is achieved when a locking sleeve 10 is downwardly displaced by the force of a spring 15 , whereas it is canceled when the locking sleeve 10 is upwardly displaced against the force of the spring 15 .
