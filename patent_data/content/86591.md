## Description
A Particulate Material Dispenser The present invention relates to apparatus for dispensing particulate materials. Particularly, but not exclusively, the present invention provides a particulate material dispenser suitable for use on an agricultural or horticultural machine for the purpose of spreading particulate materials such as fertilizers or seeds.It is well known that the even distribution of particulate materials from a hopper or storage container can frequently be detrimentally affected by clogging or jamming of the particles at points along the flow path from the hopper to the distribution point where there may for some reason be a restriction or other change in the flow path cross section. One prior art dispenser attempts to overcome this basic problem by fitting a machine with a nozzle which flares outwardly in the direction of flow of particulate material from a hopper in communication with the nozzle, and subjecting the nozzle, in use, to vibration, which may be imparted from the operation of the machine on which the dispenser is fitted. This has been found to avoid bridging of the nozzle entrance by particles of the material to be dispensed.In this known device the storage container is connected to the nozzle by a length of flexible tubing allowing the container to be mounted on a point of the machine frame spaced from the distribution point.This known dispenser has a number of disadvantages, among which are the fact that the range of particle sizes over which it will work satisfactorily is rather limited moreover, the nozzle is fixed to the machine and cannot be adapted to cope with particulate material other than the predetermined and rather limited range for which it is initially designed. The main application for the distributor is in the distribution of granular fertilizers, and since different manufacturers make granular fertilizers with a wide difference in grain size, this known device is in practice limited to the use of only the fertilizer for which it was initially designed.Moreover, since the vibration of the machine when running activates the dispensing action it is necessary to switch off the inachine every time it is needed to leave it stationary, in order to avoid excessive dispensing of particulate material at the one point where the machine is stationary.The present invention seeks to provide a particulate material dispenser suitable for use on an agricultural or horticultural machine which will be of simple and robust construction, and reliable in use both to dispense the particulate material freely and evenly when this is required, and to retain the particulate material without dispensing it when such dispensing is not required.The present invention also seeks to provide a dispenser in which a wide range or a plurality of ranges of particulate material can be accommodated and which, whatever the grain size or shape, will act reliably to avoid excess dispensing when the agricultural or horticultural machine on which it is fitted is stationary According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a particulate material dispenser for dispensing particulate material having a grain size within a predetermined range, comprising a body having means for securing the dispenser to a panel or frame member of a machine, a flow passage extending through the body, and means for releasably attaching a container for the particulate material to the body by an attachment such that the container is substantially wholly supported on the body and an outlet opening from the container communicates with the flow passage in the body, the said flow passage being so shaped and dimensioned in relation to the particulate material within the said given range of grain size as to block the flow of particulate material therethrough except when subjected to vibration.By fitting the body directly to a panel over the required distribution position, and by securing the hopper or container directly to the body itself the flow path from hopper to distribution point can be made short and straight so that the dispensing operation is both certain and effective. The container can be removed for refilling or for replacement with a full one.According to a second aspect of the invention, there is provided a dispenser for dispensing particulate material within a given range of grain size in which there are provided means defining a flow passage the shape and dimensions of which are such that particulate material within the said grain size is able to flow freely therethrough when it is subjected to vibration but is obstructed thereby when vibration is not applied, in which there are further provided flow control means operative selectively to permit or prevent the flow of said particulate material when vibration is applied to the apparatus. The dispenser can thus be shut off even when vibration is still being applied, for example when a machine to which the dispenser is fitted is still running.According to a third aspect of the invention, a particulate material dispenser has means defining a flow passage therein a part of which is so shaped and dimensioned that particulate material within a given grain size range flows freely therethrough when the dispenser is vibrated, and clogs or jams therein when the dispenser is not vibrated, wherein the said part of the flow passage is formed in a removable element and there is provided at least one interchangeable element having different dimensions for use with particulate material having a different range of grain size. Embodiments of the present invention will now be more particularly described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a perspective view of the general arrangement of a particulate material dispenser according to the present invention fitted to a domestic lawnmower Figure 2 is an exploded axial section of the dispenser constituting the embodiment of the present invention Figure 3 is a cross section taken on the line III III of Figure 2 Figure 4 is an exploded perspective view, partly cut away for clarity andFigure 5 is a partial axial section of a second em bodiment of the invention. Referring now to the drawings the dispenser shown is generally indicated 11 and is adapted to be fitted on a panel or frame member such as the horizontal panel 12 covering the rotary blades of a rotary lawnmower generally indicated 13 in Figure 1. This illustration is exemplary, and the dispenser of the invention could be fitted to any suitable machine where particulate material dispensing is required. In use, vibration of the lawnmower 13 due to running of its motor is transmitted by the panel 12 to the dispenser 11 and under the action of such vibrations the dispenser allows particulate material in a container 14 attached to the dispenser 11 to flow through an internal flow passage to be distributed into the region immediately below the lawnmower base panel where, by contact with the rotating blades, it is spread over an area equivalent to the width of track of the lawnmower. As can be seen in more detail in Figures 2 and 4, the dispenser is formed as a two part body comprising a first part 15 releasably attachable to a second part 16. The second part 16 of the dispenser body comprises a generally cylindrical wall part 17 with a conically tapered end part 18 at the narrow end of which is a transverse flange 19 from which projects a spout 20 having a threaded section 21 adjacent the flange 19. When fitted to a body panel 12 such as that illustrated in Figure 1 the spout 20 is introduced through an opening in the panel 12 and the flange 19 rests on the upper face of the panel. A threaded nut not shown is then screwed onto the threaded section 21 from below to clamp the second body part 16 of the dispenser to the panel 12 permanently.Within the conically tapered end section 18 of the cylindrical wall part 17 of the body part 16 is a conically tapered surface 22. A nozzle insert 55 is housed within the cylindrical main part 17 this nozzle has a central through passage with a narrow entrance opening 26 and a wider exit opening 27 in a generally cylindrical nozzle body 23. The lower end of the nozzle body 23 rests on the horizontal annular surface 28 constituting the radially inner extension of the flange 19 as can be seen in Figure 2.The upper face of the nozzle body 23 is formed as a flat disc 24 the diameter of which is closely matched to the inner diameter of the cylindrical main part 17. The first body part 15 of the dispenser fits onto the second part 16 by a bayonet coupling comprising two transversely extending spigots 40, 41 on the cylindrical wall 17 of the second body part and two L shape slots 36, 37 in the cylindrical wall 30 of the first body part 15. These slots will be described in greater detail below.The first body part 15 is separated into two chambers 34, 35 by a transverse wall 31 having two apertures 91, 92. The wall 31 also has a central aperture through which passes a stem 44 of a mushroom headed spreader 42 having a domed mushroom head 43. The stem 44 acts as a spindle for an apertured valve plate 45 having two apertures 48, 49 angularly spaced by the same distance as the apertures 91, 92 in the wall 31.The valve disc 45 also has an arcuate slot 50 engaged by an axial pin 51 projecting from the wall 31. The arcuate slot 50 and pin 51 limit the angular movements of the valve disc 45 between a first position in which the apertures 48, 49 are in register with the apertures 91, 92 of the wall 31 and a position where the valve disc apertures 48, 49 are moved entirely out of register with the apertures in the wall 31. The valve disc 45 is retained by an enlargement 56 on the stem 44 so that a central boss 57 in the face of the valve disc 45 nearest the wall 31 is in contact therewith and the main body of the valve disc 45 is spaced a small distance from the wall 31 so that the disc itself can flex resiliently for reasons which will be explained in more detail below. Turning movement of the disc 45 is effected by interengagement of a set of axially extending teeth 46 formed as a ring around the periphery of the disc 45 with a corresponding set of teeth 47 formed on the facing edge of the cylindrical wall 17 of the second body part 16.The teeth 46 and the teeth 47 are brought into cooperative engagement as the two body parts 15, 16 are brought together upon engagement of the spigots 40, 41 in the L shape slots 36, 37. These slots comprise an axially extending arm 36b 37b and a circumferentially extending arm 36a, 37a respectively. The open end of the axially extending arm 36b, 37b is spanned by a respective block 38, 39 serving to prevent spreading of the slot.The circumferentially extending arm 36a, 37a, of each slot has respective detent recesses 58, 59 a first adjacent the elbow between the two limbs of the L shape slot and the latter at the remote end of the circumferential arm 36a 37a. These detent notches 58, 59 serve to define the angular positions between the first and second body parts 15, 16 for the open and closed positions of the valve constituted by the wall 31 and the valve disc 45. As will be appreciated, in norms aLcircumstances when the valve is set up properly, turning movement of the first body part 15 with respect to the second body part 16 fixed to the panel 12 of the machine will cause closure of the valve by displacing the valve disc apertures 48, 49 out of register with the wall apertures 91, 92 by the time the first body part 15 has been turned to displace the spigots 40 to the elbow portion of the L shape slots 36, 37 allowing subsequent axial separation of the two parts of the dispenser. In use the first body part 15 will have attached to it a container 41 in the form of a plastics bottle having a neck 53 with a circumferential ridge 54 allowing snap engagement of the bottle into cooperating inwardly directed projections 52 in the cylindrical wall 30 of the first body part.Alternatively the bottle may be provided with a screw coupling to the first body part. Whatever form this connection takes it is desirable for the valve to be closed when the first body part 15 is separated from the second body part. should the valve become displaced from the closed position inadvertently, or due to tampering whilst it is separated from the second body part 16 the valve disc 45 will reach its open position, limited by engagement of the pin 51 in the end of the arcuate slot 50 before relative turning movement between the first body part 15 and second body pait 16 has been completed, in which position the spiguts 40, 41 will not be completely lodged in the detent notches 59 at the ends of the circumferential arms 36a 37a of the L shape slots. To allow this turning movement to continue without further turning the valve disc 45 the inter engagement between the teeth 46 and the teeth 47 can be over ridden due to flexure of the plate 45 allowing the teeth to jump over one another until the spigots 40, 41 engage in the detent notches 59. The valve will then operate normally.The tapered insert nozzle 55 illustrated in Figure 2 has a predetermined nozzle dimension suitable for operation with particulate material of a given grain size. Should it be desired to change the material being dispensed, by fitting a different bottle 41, it is a simple matter to remove the nozzle 55 after separation of the two body parts 15, 16, and replace it with a nozzle having different dimensions. Conveniently the nozzles will be colour coded to facilitate identification of the dimensions. Removal of the nozzle 55 from its seat within the second body part 16 can be effected simply by pressing one side of the disc 24 allowing the lower part of the cylindrical portion 23 to rock on the conical surface 22 tilting the disc 24 to allow it to be gripped then by its opposite edge for removal.Figure 5 illustrates an alternative disc configuration where the boss 57 extends radially outw dly further than in the embodiment illustrated in Figures 1 to 4 so that face to face contact between the disc 45 and the wall 31 takes place in the region of the apertures 48, 49 and cooperating wall apertures 91, 92 where in the embodiment of Figures 1 to 4 there is a small space between the disc and the wall. Adequate flexural movement of the teeth 46 to permit the above described over ride action is achieved by forming a suit able annular notch 61 in the periphery of the disc 45 on the face opposite that from which the teeth 46 project leaving a thin neck 60 of disc material between the main body of the disc and the teeth. This allows the outer peripheral ring of the disc to flex to permit the teeth 46 to jump over the teeth 47 if necessary without causing deformation or damage to the teeth.
