# Preparation of S chloromethylated O alkyl substituted phosphodithioic acids.

## Abstract
A novel and efficient method for preparing S chloromethyl derivatives of O alkylphosphorodithioic acids involves reacting the S hydroxy methyl derivative of such an acid under substantially anhydrous conditions with a suitable acid chloride in a chemically unreactive organic liquid which is a solvent for both said S hydroxymethyl derivative and said acid chloride. Suitable acid chlorides are PCl₅, PCl₃, acetyl chloride, chlorinated derivatives of acetyl chloride, oxyalyl chloride, phosgene, thionyl chloride, sul furyl chloride, aryl sulfonyl chlorides and chloro or nitro substituted aryl sulfonyl chlorides.
