# SYSTEM FOR OPTICAL MONITORING OF MACHINE POSITIONS

## Abstract
A robotic installation composed of a plurality of machines disposed adjacent a common work space deli mited by a boundary surface, each machine being associated with a respective portion of the boundary surface and having a work performing member movable into and out of the work space through the associated boundary surface por tion, and an optical monitoring system composed of a plurality of optical monitoring assemblies each associated with a respective machine. Each assembly includes a light barrier structure including a plurality of light sensors each disposed in a light beam path to form a light barrier to produce an electrical signal indicative of reception of light, or a warning signal in case of an intrusion, a control device causes any selected work performing member of the associ ated machine to remain outside the work space when a warning signal is produced.
