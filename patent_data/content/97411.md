# Foamed polyimide and polyamide imide, and production thereof.

## Abstract
Methods of making modified polyimide polyimide amide foams and the resulting compositions. An N substituted aliphatic imide is prepared by reacting a suitable aromatic dianhydride with a suitable oxoimine. A polyimide forming material is prepared by dissolving the N substituted aliphatic imide in an esterifying solvent, then adding a suitable aromatic diamine. This material is dried to a powder or film. A foam is produced by heating the material to reaction temperature for a period sufficient to produce a stable foam. The material melts, then spontaneously ex pands into a foam which becomes self supporting and cures to a resilient flexible foam. Depending upon heating condi tions, a polyimide, polyimide amide or mixture thereof may be produced, resulting in foams having varying physical properties.
