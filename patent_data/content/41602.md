# Electrophotographic copier and method for producing copies in booklet form.

## Abstract
A copier is arranged to produce a developed image of an original on one half of an imaging area of an imaging element and to transfer this image to one half of a copy sheet. To produce a booklet from a number of originals 303 , half of the originals are fed to an exposure platen but only odd num bered ones are scanned to produce copies of one half of one side of copy sheets 301 and 302 . The copy sheets are then reversed and reloaded in reverse order and the remaining originals are similarly fed and scanned. The originals are then restacked in the reverse of their original order and the process is repeated to produce copies on the halves of the copy sheets which are still blank.
