# Matrix encoder for resistive sensor arrays.

## Abstract
The invention provides an encoder which includes a matrix 14 14 min interconnecting an array of resistive sensors 51 80 51 min 75 min between inputs and outputs thereof with the outputs being held at a constant voltage. The encoder further includes a detecting circuit 20 20 min having a current measuring detector 106 110 106 min 110 min for receiving sensing currents 136 138 from said outputs and producing current responsive detection signals 22 26 in response to sequential scanning of the matrix inputs.
