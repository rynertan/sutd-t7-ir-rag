# Idler recoil assembly.

## Abstract
The assembly 10 protects a track chain 28 from damage when some foreign object, such as a rock, is trapped between the chain link assembly 28 and a chain supporting element 24 . An idler link 30 is pivotally connected to a track frame 12 and a recoilable rear idler 24 is rotatably positioned on an idler hub 54 itself pivotally connected to the idler link 30 . An increase in tension on the endless chain link assembly 28 causes the idler hub 54 to rotate away from the endless chain link assembly 28 decreasing track path length and, consequently, tension. This rotation is resiliently resisted by a recoil pad 66 mounted between the idler hub 54 and the idler link 30 . An adjustable tensile link 68 prevents any recoil up to a preselected endless chain link assembly 28 tension.
