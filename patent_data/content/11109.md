# Domain drag effect devices.

## Abstract
A domain drag effect stripline pattern 10 of conductive magnetic bubble material deposited upon a substrate 11 is located in a magnetic bias field preferably normal to the plane of the stripline. Magnetic bubbles can be propagated through the stripline in response to passage of D.C. current pulses through the stripline. The width and cross sectional area of the stripline is preferably substantially constant except at a switching area 16 where it may be different, and preferably wider. There is a coil 13 juxtaposed with the stripline to apply a magnetic field upon the switching area with the magnetic field varying above and below a critical value to switch the propagation of magnetic bubbles, along the stripline on and off as a function of the current IC through the coil. Alterna tively the external magnetic bias field H Bias can be mod ulated to turn the stripline switch on and off. In another aspect of this invention a domain drag effect velocity modulator apparatus is provided at modulation points by varying the magnetic field at the modulation points. Such modulation can slow down or speed up the bubble velocity, depending upon the design.
