# Locking differential.

## Abstract
A differential gear mechanism of the limited slip type is provided. The mechanism includes a clutch, including a plurality of discs 31 and 33 , and a cam mechanism including a main cam member 43 and an intermediate cam member 45 . The intermediate cam member is splined to the side gear 19 , such that axial forces are not transmitted to the side gear. The main cam member 43 defines a set of internal gear teeth 81 , engaging an externally toothed member 79 of an actuating mechanism 71 . The arrange ment of the cam members and the provision of the gear teeth on the inner periphery of the main cam member results in a differential gear mechanism having a substantially reduced bearing span , combined with a reduced casing diameter.
