# Method and system for data compression and restoration.

## Abstract
Method of data compression and restoration wherein an input data string including repetitive data more in num ber than the specified value is transformed into a data string having a format including the first region 1 where non compressed data are placed, the second region 5 includ ing a datum representative of a data string section which has undergone the compression process and information indicative of the number of repetitive data, i.e., the length of the data string section, and control information 2A, 2B inserted at the front and back of the first region indicative of the number of data included in the first region, said transformed data string being recorded on the recording medium, and, for data reproduction, the first and second regions are identified on the basis of the control information read out on the recording medium so that the compressed data string section is transformed back to the original data string in the form of repetitive data.
