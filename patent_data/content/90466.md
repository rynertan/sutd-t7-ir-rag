# Video signal multiplying circuit.

## Abstract
A video signal multiplying circuit with automatic cor rection of a time varying unbalance at a signal multiplier 1 . A combination of a multiplying signal MS and a periodi cally pulse shaped signal HS having a pulse in a blanking period THB is applied to the signal multiplier 1 . An output 4 of the signal multiplier 1 is fedback via a signal sample and hold circuit 20, 21, 24, 25 and a subsequent signal comparison and integrating circuit 16, 17, 18 to an input 2 of the multiplier 1 to which also a video signal VS is applied. Signal samples are taken in the blanking period THB , more specifically during the duration of the said pulse and outside this pulse duration. The result is that the black level in the multiplied video signal MVS is not influenced by the unbalance.
