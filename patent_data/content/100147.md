# Vibration damping constrained layer constructions.

## Abstract
A constrained layer construction comprising a stiff layer or substrate and a layer of a viscoelastic polymer which is the reaction product of a 25 to 75 weight percent of an acryloyl or methacryloyl derivative of at least one oligo mer, said oligomer having a glass transition temperature of less than 25 C and a molecular weight per oligomer of 600 t0 20,000, and b 75 to 25 weight percent of a copolymer izable monomer whose homopolymer has a glass transition temperature of at least 50 C, the copolymer being suitable for damping vibrations at relatively high temperatures, e.g., 5 150 C, is disclosed. Also included is a process for damping vibrations in component parts of devices used in automotive, aerospace, and computer industries.
