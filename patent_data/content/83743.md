# Segment ester polycarbonates derived from a cyclic bisphenol and iso or terephthalic acid.

## Abstract
Segment ester polycarbonates have improved resist ance to high heat distortion when portions of the polymer contain units derived from 4,4 cyclohexylidenediphenol and derivatives thereof. Preferred high heat distortion segment ester polycarbonates include the copolyestercarbonate with segments derived from isophthalic acid and 4,4 cyclohexylidenediphenol and or terephthalic acid and 4,4 cyclohexylidenediphenol. Films made of the segment ester copolycarbonates have improved resistance to high heat distortion.
