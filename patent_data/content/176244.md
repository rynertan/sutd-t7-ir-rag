# NON INVERTING HIGH SPEED LOW LEVEL GATE TO SCHOTTKY TRANSISTOR TRANSISTOR LOGIC TRANSLATOR

## Abstract
A non inverting high speed low level gate to Schottky transistor logic translator circuit includes a first input circuit adapted for receiving a first input signal and having its outputs connected to a first node and a second node. A first Schottky transistor is provided which has its base connected to the first node and to a voltage supply potential via a first resistor, its emitter connected to the second node and its collector connected to a third node and to the supply potential via a second resistor. A second Schottky transistor is provided which has its base coupled to the third node, its collector connected to the supply potential via a third resistor and its emitter connected to a fifth node. An upper output transistor has its base connected to the fifth node and to a ground potential via a fourth resistor, its collector connected to the supply potential via a fifth resistor and its emitter connected to an output circuit terminal. A lower output transistor has its base connected to the second node, its collector connected to the output circuit terminal and its emitter connected to the ground potential. A fourth input circuit formed of low level NAND gates is adapted for receiving a fourth input signal and has its output connected to the second node and the fourth node for turning off the lower output transistor so as to maintain the output circuit terminal in a high impedance state. A second and fourth circuit formed of low level NAND gates is adapted for receiving second and third input signals and has its outputs connected to first and second nodes.
