# REPLACEMENTS FOR LIGAMENTS AND TENDONS

## Abstract
A surgical element for use as a replacement or aug mentation for a damaged ligament or tendon comprises a multiplicity of flexible filaments e.g., carbon fibres held to gether in substantially parallel array, characterised in that these filaments for a core 11 with braided sheathing 12 over at least one portion. The sheathing filaments may have a more open weave over an intermediate portion of the core, or not braided over a window 16 , or omitted com pletely from an intermediate portion, for encouraging pen etration and ingrowth of healing tissue between the core fi laments. Tails 13 are formed into eyes 18 by looping and secured to bones 19 by attachment devices 20 , with the window located where it is desired to encourage the in growth of healing tissue.
