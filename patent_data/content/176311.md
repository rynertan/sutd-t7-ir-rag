# Small antenna.

## Abstract
A small antenna comprising a dielectric substrate, a radiation element provided on one major surface of the dielectric substrate, a ground element provided on the other major surface of the dielectric substrate. A feed point on the ground element is located at a position where a voltage of a standing voltage wave induced on the ground element becomes minimum. The antenna may be further provided with a short circuit element for electrically connecting one ends of the radiation and ground elements.
