# AUDIOTACTILE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM

## Abstract
An audiotactile communication system including input apparatus including apparatus for converting audio signals into input electrical signals related to the audio signals, circuit apparatus responsive to the electrical signals for producing first or second output electrical signals, the first signals being produced when a DC signal which is a function of the input electrical signals is not less than a selected reference DC signal and the second signals being produced when the DC signal is less than the selected reference DC signal, and transducer apparatus responsive to the output electrical signals for providing tactile signals adapted to be sensed by a person.
