## Description
OZONIZATION SYSTEM FOR DRINKING WATER DISINFECTION TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to oxygen recycle ozonization systems and the utilization of the obtained ozone containing product gas. BACKGROUND OF THE PRIOR ART It has been demonstrated that the power requirements to generate ozone can be significantly reduced when the charge to the ozone generator is oxygen enriched air instead of atmospheric air. In addition, the size of the ozone generator required should be drastically reduced when the charge gas is rich in oxygen. However, when the cost of such oxygen is taken into consideration, the use thereof as feed to the ozone generator becomes uneconomical unless the total ozone requirement is very large. To overcome these cost disadvantages of using oxygen enriched gas for production of ozone, it has been suggested in the art to reuse the off gas from the ozonization process, taking advantage of its high oxygen content. Thus, it has been proposed to recirculate all of the oxygen containing off gas, after utilization of the ozonized gas for its intended purpose, back to the ozone generator for reozonization and reuse. In many applications, such as wastewater treatment and water purification, this off gas will contain substantial quantities of contaminants such as nitrogen and carbon dioxide, stripped from material subjected to ozonization treatment.If these contaminants are not removed, they continue progressively to accumulate in the recycle gas charged to the ozone generator, thus diluting the initial desired advantage of using a feed gas to the ozone generator having a high oxygen content.Accordingly, it was proposed to purify the recycle gas before introducing the same to the ozone generator.The needed purification to permit recycling was found to be expensive and has often been deemed impractical from an economics standpoint. In integrated systems where ozonization is employed in connection with a treating operation utilizing oxygen rich gas upstream or downstream of the ozonizer, economics may favor the use of oxygen enriched gas as feed to the ozone generator. This is true, for example, in activated sludge installations utilizing oxygenenriched gas for treatment of sewage, wherein the supernatant treated liquid discharged from the final settling and clarifying tank is subjected to disinfection by treatment with ozone containing gas. One such integrated system is described, for example, in U.S.Patent No. 4,132,637. In accordance with the procedure disclosed in the aforesaid U.S. Patent No. 4,132,637, the oxygen rich off gas from the ozone disinfection step is dried and a portion thereof, containing nitrogen and CO2 contaminants, is recycled to the ozone generator, such portion constituting 30 to 90 of the gaseous effluent from the ozone contacting zone. All or part of the remaining gaseous effluent from the ozone contacting zone is used to supply oxygen enriched aerating gas employed in the acti vated sludge treatment plant. Any excess gas not required for use in the activated sludge plant is vented.Means are provided in the activated sludge oxygenation tank to measure the concentration of dissolved oxygen, and thus determine the need for venting part of the gas supplied from the dried ozonizer effluent or addition of make up oxygen rich gas from the original source supplying the ozone generator. While integrated installations such as that described in the aforesaid patent, if properly designed, may be economically attractive, that is not the case when the ozone produced from oxygen enriched air is to be used in an isolated operation wherein there is no associated process in which the oxygen rich off gas from the ozone contactor can be utilized. The last named situation obtains, for example, in systems for treating drinking water. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Among the objects of the present invention, accordingly are to provide an integrated system and process for the economical generation of ozone from oxygen for use in treatment of material where there is no significant supplementary oxygen requirement, such as in the treatment of drinking water. In accordance with the invention, substantially pure oxygen gas or oxygen enriched air is charged to an ozone generation loop and the thus obtained product gas containing about 1 to 6 ozone is utilized in ozonization of drinking water or other similar liquid material.The wet off gas from such contacting operation, which will contain a substantial concentration of oxygen in excess of that contained in atmospheric air and contaminants, such as nitrogen and carbon dioxide, is split into two fractions. One such fraction is dried and recycled as feed to the ozone generator. The other fraction is employed in stripping at least part of the nitrogen and carbon dioxide contained in the liquid being charged as feed to the ozone contactor, thus reducing the extent of buildup of such contaminants in the recycled gas. The operation of the invention will be understood and certain of its advantages appreciated from the detailed description which follows read in connection with the accompanying drawings. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Figure 1 of the drawings is a block flow diagram of a prior art system wherein the off gas from ozonization is utilized in aeration of sewage or municipal waste water. Figure 2 is a block flow diagram of a system wherein a portion of the off gas from the ozone is dried and recycled, the remainder being vented as a purge stream after destruction of contained residual ozone therein. Figure 3 is a block flow diagram of a system in accordance with the present invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION It will be seen that in the system illustrated inFigure 1 as well as that in Figure 2 an ozone destructor is employed to avoid discharge of ozone to the atmosphere and or material corrosion problems in the transfer condlits and equipment. Moreover, not only does the ozone destructor add to equipment and operating costs of these systems but, in addition, a small but valuable amount of ozone product is thus being wasted. In theFigure 2 embodiment, also, the purge stream needed to avoid contaminants build up in the recycle stream, results in large amounts of oxygen being wasted by venting. In the system illustrated in Figure 3 oxygen consumption is less than that required by the system ofFigure 1 or 2, resulting in reduced operation costs for oxygen supply. In the system of the invention as illustrated inFigure 3, a feed gas of high oxygen content is added by line 9 to recycle line 24 and introduced to an ozone generator 11 by line 10. The preferred fresh feed gas is one containing at least 70 and preferably 90 or more oxygen by weight . Any known type of ozone generator may be employed, preferably one of the silent electric discharge type. The generator is operated under conditions to produce a product gas containing at least 1 and preferably from about 2 to about 6 ozone. The product gas discharged from the generator by line 12 is sent directly to the point of use, indicated by the ozone contactor 15. In the illustrated embodiment, water to be treated for drinking is introduced into the contactor by line 16 and the thus ozonated water effluent discharged through line 17. The off gas discharged from the contactor 15 by line 20 will be saturated with water at the temperature of the contactor. It will also contain gaseous contaminants such as nitrogen and carbon dioxide stripped from tiac influent water, as will hereinafter be explained. The off gas discharged via line 20 is split into a recycle stream 21 and a purge stream 22. The recycle stream, which preferably will generally constitute the major part of the off gas discharged in line 20, is dried to a dewpoint of at least minus 200F 290C , preferably to less than minus 400F minus 400C , and the dried gas is recycled to the ozone generator via line 24. Preferably the recycle gas stream should constitute at least about 70 of the off gas withdrawn from the contactor in line 20. Water to be purified is introduced into a contaminant stripper 25 by supply line 26 where it is contacted with the purge stream introduced into vessel 25 by line 22. As a result of such contact between the influent water and the purge gas stream, part of the nitrogen and carbon dioxide will be stripped from the influent water, decreasing the quantity of these contaminants admitted to the ozone contactor via line 16. Stripper 25 may be integrated with ozone contactor 15 by using a common basin. Stripper 25 would be provided as a preliminary liquid stage to the ozone contactor 15 with the gas spaces of the two stages isolated from each other by a wall which penetrates the surface of the liquid. In the operation as thus far described it will be seen that the relative proportion of the off gas from line 20 which is purged via line 22 will control the oxygen purity of the recycle loop. As the purge stream flow is increased, the oxygen purity of the recycle loop is thereby increased. The vent gas discharged from the stripper 25 by line 27 will contain morçe nitrogen and less oxygen than that present in the purge gas in line 22. The ozone content of the vent gas will be negligible if the ozone contactor is properly designed, constituting less than 1 of the total ozone content in purge stream 22. For successful operation, the influent water must be in equilibrium with nitrogen at a partial pressure greater than that of the purge gas. In this system the flow rate of the volume of the wet off gas of line 22 is controlled relative to the flow rate of the volume of wet off gas of line 21 so that the molar oxygen flow rate of the gas of line 27 is less than about 50 per cent of the molar oxygen flow rate of the high oxygen content feed gas of line 9. The temperature and pressure ranges of the feed gas to the ozone generator are generally those heretofore normally employed in such operation employing high concentration oxygen feed gas, and depend to large extent upon the particular type of generator employed.In general the feed gas to be introduced into the ozone generator is at a temperature below 1200F 490C and preferably lower than 1000F 380C . Typical operating pressure is 15 to 45 psia 1 to 3 bars , although a pressure as low as 10 psia 0.7 bars or as high as 50 psia 3.5 bars may be employed. The oxygen purity in the recycle loop is a key factor in the effectiveness and economic advantages of the process of the invention. At an oxygen purity in the recycle loop below about 50 , which would result from taking a relatively small fraction of the off gas as the purge stream line 22 , nitrogen stripping would become relatively inefficient. On the other hand, to maintain the oxygen purity in the recycle loop at above 90 would require a high oxygen feed rate that may render the system uneconomical. A typical operation in practice of the invention is illustrated by but not limited to the following example. EXAMPLE 1 The projected design need for a facility to purify 15MUD water is an ozone system which will produce 350 lbs day ozone for an absorbed dosage of 2.5 ppm ozone.The composition of the gas and the design flow rates in the several lines are shown in Table 1.

These estimates were are based the on use of an ozone generator capable of producing 500 lbs day ozone from an 80 oxygen feed. The generator produces 2 O3 from air, 4 ozone from 2 the recycle stream to the ozone generator contains 80 02. Power costs are calculated on a basis of 0.03 KWH and oxygen costs at 60 ton. The system of the invention obtains at these values, a saving of over 30 in equipment costs and almost 10 in operating costs, as compared to a system using air as feed to the ozone generator. As compared to a conventional system feeding high purity oxygen, with total recycle of the off gas, the system of the invention obtains greater than 10 savings in operating costs.
