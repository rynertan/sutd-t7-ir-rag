# Microwave oscillator.

## Abstract
A microwave oscillatorincluding a GaAs field effect trans istor 2 having a gate electrode, a drain electrode and a source electrode and disposed on a planar substrate. An elongated gate transmission line 30 is connected to the gate electrode of the field effect transistor and disposed on the substrate and terminated by a matching impedance 10 . An elongated drain transmission line 40 is connected to the drain electrode of the field effect transistor and disposed on the substrate at a predetermined angle to the gate transmis sion line while an elongated source transmission line 50 is connected to the source electrode and disposed on the subs trate for providing the oscillating output. A dielectric resonator 60 is disposed within an angle formed between the gate transmission line and the drain transmission line.
