# Self contained lash adjuster with shell mounted cartridge assembly.

## Abstract
A self contained lash adjuster includes a generally cylin drical cup shaped follower which has an end face. A lash adjuster cartridge assembly is positioned within the follower. The cartridge assembly includes a reciprocally movable body and a plunger within the body. There is a high pressure cham ber defined between the plunger and the body and a plunger passage opens into the high pressure chamber. A check valve controls fluid flow through the plunger passage. A shell holds the cartridge assembly to the follower and has an annular wall extending peripherally about the movable body of the car tridge assembly. There is an annular expandable seal mem ber fastened at one end to the shell and at the other end to the body to define a reservoir outside of the cartridge assembly. Movement of the body toward the plunger moves fluid from the high pressure chamber to the reservoir.
