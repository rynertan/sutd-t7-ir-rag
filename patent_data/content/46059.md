# Method of plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition of films.

## Abstract
Improved films of, for instance, phosphosilicate glass on a substrate are obtained by plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition of a reaction gas mixture including SiH₄, N₂O and, for instance PH₃ provided the mole ratio N₂O SiH₄ is 50 or more and the mole ratio PH₃ SiH₄ is 0.08 or less.
