# Process for the manufacture of fibres from poly p phenylene terephthalamide.

## Abstract
A process for the manufacture of fibres from a polyamide entirely or substantially consisting of poly p phenylene terephthalamide, by spinning a spinning mass having a temperature of 20 120 C and consisting of a mixture of concentrated sulphuric acid having a strength of at least 96 by weight and, calculated on the weight of the mixture, at least 15 of polyamide having an inherent viscosity of at least 2,5, the spinning mass being downwardly extruded into a coagulation bath from a spinneret whose efflux side is positioned in a gaseous inert medium and shortly above the liquid surface of the coagulation bath. The spinning mass is prepared by the successive steps of cooling the concentrated sulphuric acid to below its solidifying point, combining the sulphuric acid thus cooled and the polyamide, intermixing the two substances into a solid state mixture and heating the resulting solid state mixture to spinning temperature.
