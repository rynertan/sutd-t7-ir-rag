# Optical signal reproducing system.

## Abstract
An optical signal reproducing system uses laser light reflected from a recording disc track to recover signals stored in pits separated by lands. A differential output for med from the reflected light by an amplifier 17 only when the focused beam is incident on pits is used to control lateral tracking offset correction in a negative feedback mode, thereby immunizing the system from false tracking correc tion due to light reflected from lands when the disc is tilted from the optical axis. In one embodiment, a wave shaper 19a controls gate circuits 22, 23 to pass signals to the amplifier 17 only when light reflected from pits is being received by a detector 16.
