## Description
LHRH PREPARATIONS FOR INTRANASAL ADMINISTRATION Tne present invention relates to a novel LHRH formulation. More particularly, tne present invention relates to an aqueous LHRH active nona or decapeptide preparation containing a surfactant derived from a bile acid or a salt thereof which is suitable for intranasal administration. Luteinizing normone LH and follicular stimulating hormone FSH are released from the anterior pituitary gland unaer the control of tne releasing hormone LHRH produced in the nypothalmic region. LH and FSH act on the gonads to stimulate tne synthesis of steroid hormones and to stimulate gamete maturation. The pulsatile release of LHRH, and thereby the release of LH and FSH, control the reproductive cycle in domestic animals and humans. LHRH also affects the placenta, and tne gonads indirectly in causing tne release of chorionic gonaclotropin hCG . LHRH peptides have heretofore been administered almost exclusiveLy by injection. Other methods of administration, e.g., oral, nasal, intratracneal and rectal administration, have been investigated but because these compounds are polypeptides, these routes of administration have had little or no pharmacological effect because of poor absorption or the effect has been somewhat uncontrollable at best because of irregular absorption. When non injection routes are used, the drug dose must be substantially increased because the amount of drug reaching tne intended site of activity is greatly reduced by mechanisms ongoing in the absorption process which prevent absorption or degrade the peptides during absorption. The nasal administration of insulin to rats is aescribed by S. Hirai, et al, in the InternationalJournal of Pharmaceutics, 9, 165 172 1981 . In this reference, aqueous insulin solutions containing a surfactant nave indicated that, in certain instances, the presence of certain surfactants results in decreased serum glucose levels over control solutions comprising water and insulin. The Hirai reference discloses surfactants from a broad range of types including ethers, esters, anionic surfactants, amphoterics, bile acid salts, a glycoside and a peptidelipid. Except for a few isolated cases, the polyoxyethelene fatty acid ethers, anionic, amphoteric, bile acid salt, glycoside, and peptidelipid surfactants all showed an approximately equivalent decrement in plasma glucose levels.While the decrement in plasma glucose levels is an indirect measure of insulin absorption, it is clear that most of the surfactants tested had an equal effect on the uptake of insulin administered by the nasal route in rats. A British Patent 1,527,605 published October 4, 1978 describes the use of surfactants for enhancing insulin uptake across the nasal membrane. Hirai is one of the inventors on this patent. Tne effect of sodium glycocholate on the uptake of insulin administered by nasal spray to humans is reported by A.E. Ponteroli, et al, British Medical Journal, Vol 284, pp 303 306, 1982 . Since a single surfactant was used tnere the relative effect of sodium glycocnolate versus other surfactant on insulin uptake cannot be apprised. It has now been found that the combination of bile acids and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts withLHRH analogs greatly enhance LHRH absorption across the nasal membranes relative to other surfactants. The present invention provides a nasal composition comprising a nona or decapeptide or its pharmaceutically acceptable salt naving LHRH agonist or antagonist activity and a surfactant which is bile acid or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof formulated in an aqueous solution. In one embodiment the present invention relates to a novel nasal spray composition comprising an LHRH agonist or antagonist compound plus a surfactant which is a bile acid or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof formulated in an aqueous solution which may be buffered and may contain other appropriate pnarmaceutical excipients, for example, co solvents, chelating agents, preservatives and the like. The invention also relates to a method for enhancing the nasal uptake of a LHRH analog, which method comprises adding a surfactant which is a bile acid or a pnarmaceutically acceptable salt thereof to a nasal composition comprising a nona on decapeptide or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof having LHRH agonist or antagonist activity formulated in an aqueous solution. Agonist and antagonist analogs of LHRH nave been prepared and found to be useful in the control of fertility in both male and female are useful in the reduction in accessory organ weight in male and female will promote weight gain in domestic animals in feedlot situations will stimulate abortion in pregnant animals and in general act as chemical sterilants. The natural hormone releasing hormone, LHRH, is a decapeptide comprised of naturally occurring amino acids which have the L configuration except for the achiral amino acid glycine . Its sequence is as follows pyro Glu His Trp Ser Tyr Gly Leu Arg Pro GlyNH2 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10A large number of analogs of this natural material nave been prepared and studied in attempts to find compounds wnlicn nave greater agonist or antagonist activity. By far the most significant modification for the ennancement of agonist activity is obtained by changing the 6 position residue from Gly to a D amino acid. In addition, substantial increased agonist activity is obtained by eliminating the Gly NH2 in position 10 to afford a nonapeptide as an alkyl, cycloalkyl or fluoralkylamide or by replacing the Gly NH2 by an a azaglycine amide. In yet other instances modifications have been made at positions 1 and 2 in attempts to enhance agonist activity. In addition to the preparation of agonist analogs, a number of nona and decapeptides have been prepared whicn are competitive antagonists to LHRH, all of which require deletion or replacement of the histidine residue at position 2. In general, it appears that a D amino acid placed in the sequence at that position gives the best antagonist activity. It has also been snown that adding a modification at the 6 position, which, witnout the modification at position 2 results in the agonist activity noted above, ennances the antagonist activity of the 2 modified analogs. Additional increments in antagonist activity may be had by modifying positions 1, 3 and or 10 in the already 2, 6 modified peptide. It has also been shown that N acylation of the. amino acid at position 1 is helpful. Tnis invention has application to LHRH and all synthetic agonist and antagonist analogs thereof. the patent and periodical literature is replete with nonaand decapeptides of this type. It is intended that all such compounds will be within the scope of this invention. Nona or decapeptides having LHRH agonist or antagonist activity are disclosed, along with processes for preparation thereof, in the following U.S. Patents.3,813,382 3,842,065 3,849,389 3,855,199 3,886,135 3,890,437 3,892,723 3,896,104 3,901,872 3,914,412 3,915,947 3,929,759 3,937,695 3,953,416 3,974,135 4,010,125 4,018,914 4,022,759 4,022,760 4,022,761 4,024,248 4,034,082 4,072,668 4,075,189 4,075,192 4,086,219 4,101,538 4,124,577 4,124,578 4,143,133 4,234,571 4,253,997 4,292,313 4,341,767.

More preferably, the surfactant used in the practice of this invention will be an alkali metal salt of glycocholic acid, most preferably sodium glycocholate. The amount of surfactant used for the practice of this invention will be some amount which increases the absorption of LHRH peptides over that of other surfactants which also may enhance peptide absorption to a certain degree. It has been found that such an amount is often in the range between 0.2 and 15 , more often 0.2 to 5 percent by weight volume of the solution. It is preferred that the surfactant be present in an amount between about 0.5 to 4 percent by weight volume, conveniently about 1 percent by weight volume, preferably about 2 percent by weight volume. The subject nasal formulations will be formulated in water but more preferably it will be formulated in a solution buffered to a pH of between about 3.0 and 8.0, most preferably pH 5.0 5.4, by means of some pharmaceutically acceptable buffer system. Any pharmaceutically acceptable buffering system capable of maintaining a pH in the denoted range may be used for the practice of tis invention. A typical buffer will be, for example, an acetate buffer, a phosphate buffer, a citrate buffer, a succinate buffer or the like. The buffer of choice herein is an acetate buffer in a concentration of between 0.005 and 0.1 molar, most prererably 0.02 molar. Water or buffer solution is added in a quantity sufficient to make volume. Other materials such as preservatives, salts to acnieve the tonic value of tissue, or other additives indicated by known nasal formulation chemistry may be added to these formulations. Particularly advantageous other such materials include surfactants, suitably non ionic surfactants such as the polysorbates, in concentrations suitably in the range 0.1 to 5, more suitably 0.25 to 2 weight volume. It nas been found that often to obtain enhanced solubility and stability, the molar ratio of bile acid to peptide is usefully 20 1, such as 25 1. In one suitable embodiment, the present invention relates to a nasal spray composition having enhanced LHRH polypeptide absorption comprising 0.005 to Smg ml of a nona or decapeptide or its pharmaceutically acceptable salt having LHRH agonist or antagonist activity 0.2 to 5 by weignt volume of a surfactant whicn is a bile acid or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and a buffered aqueous solution in a quantity sufficient to make volume. In a furtner suitable embodiment, this invention also relates to a method for the nasal uptake ofHRH which method comprises adding 0.2 to 5 percent by weigt volume of a surfactant which is a bile acid or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof to a nasal spray composition comprising 0.005 to 5 mg ml of a nona or decapeptide or its pnarmaceutically acceptable salt having LHRH agonist or antagonist activity and buffered aqueous solution in a quantity sufficient to make volume. The invention also provides a process for preparing the nasal compositions of the invention, which comprises bringing into aqueous solution the peptide and the surfactant. As will be clear from the foregoing, this process may be carried out in known manner for preparing nasal aqueous compositions. Suitably, the peptide is first dissolved in buffer, and then added to the surfactant, the pH adjusted as required, and the volume made up to the desired level. Additional components can be added in at any convenient stage in tne process. The nasal compositions of this invention may be administered in conventional manner. For example, sufficient composition to deliver an effective dose ofLHRH analog is administered to the nostrils, conveniently in a divided dose being administered to each nostril, suitably by means of a spray. Suitably a spray bottle with a metered dose conveniently 100 ul per spray spray attachment is used. The invention is illustrated by tne following nonlimiting examples. EXAMPLE 1 6.25 milligrams of pyro Glu His Trp Ser Tyr 3 2 napnthyl D alanyl Leu Arg Pro Gly NH2 were dissolved in 5 ml of a 0.02 molar acetate buffer solution having a pH of about 5.2 in a volumetric flask. A nundred milligrams of sodium glycocholate were then dissolved in this solution which is brought almost to volume, tne pH adjusted to 5.2 plus or minus 0.2 and then a volume of buffer added in a quantity sufficient to make 10 ml. EXAMPLE 2 1 mg of pyro Glu His Trp Ser Tyr 3 2 naphthyl D alanyl Leu Arg Pro Gly NH2 was dissolved in 50 ml of a 0.02 molar acetate buffer solution having a pH of about 5.2, and was added to a solution containing 500 mg of sodium glycocholate, the pH adjusted to 5.2 0.2, and then a volume of buffer added in a quantity sufficient to make 100 ml. EXAMPLE 3 2 mg of pyro Glu His Trp Ser Tyr 3 2 napnthyl D analyl Leu Arg Pro Gly NH2 was dissolved in 5 ml of a 0.02 molar pnosphate buffer having a pH of about 7.0, and was added to a solution containing 75 mg of sodium glycodeoxy cholate, the pH adjusted to 7.0 i 0.2, and then a volume of buffer added in a quantity sufficient to make 10 ml. EXAMPLE 4 50 mg of N Ac D Nal 2 D pCl Phe D Trp Ser Tyr D Deh Leu Arg Pro D AlaNH2 was dissolved in 5 ml of a 0.02 molar acetate buffer solution having a pH of about 5.2, and was added to a solution containing 500 mg of sodium glycocholate,tne pH adjusted to 5.2 0.2, and then a volume of buffer added in a quantity sufficient to make 10 ml. EXAMPLE 5 The procedure of Example 2 was repeated, but using 17.5 mg of peptide and 200 mg of sodium glycocholate. EXAMPLE 6 The procedure of Example 2 was repeated, but using 12.5 mg of peptide and 200 mg of sodium glycocr,olate. EXAMPLE 7 The procedure of Example 2 was repeated, but 0.5 w v of Polysorbate 20 polyoxyethylene 20 sorbitan monolaurate was also incorporated in the solution. EXAMPLE 8 The procedure of Example 2 was repeated, but using 10 mg of peptide and 150 mg of sodium glycocholate. Note, in the Examples the peptides were used in the form of their acetate salts.
