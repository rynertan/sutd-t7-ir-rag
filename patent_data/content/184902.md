# Composite helmet.

## Abstract
A preform 36 for a protective helmet is made from resin impregnated blanks cut from a length of reinforcing fabric 10 along a zig zag line 13 so that each part 14, 15 has a straight edge 11, 12 and a series of teeth 18, 19 defining the opposite edge. Lengths are cut off from each part 14, 15 to form the blanks and are wrapped in a plurality of layers around a cylindri cal former, sized to correspond to the head size of the helmet, so that the teeth in successive layers are in staggered relation ship. The layers are then compressed in a press 34, 35 to bend the teeth 18 over into mutual engagement and form a rigid domed preform 36 .
