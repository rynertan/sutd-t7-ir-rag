# Resonator filters on dielectric substrates.

## Abstract
A resonator filter comprises a pair of first and second electrodes 16,17 electrically confronting each other through a dielectric 15 , each of said first and second electrodes hav ing at least one bent portion to present primarily a lumped constant inductance and having a desired equivalent electri cal length, said first and second electrodes 16,17 having ground or common terminals located out of mutually confronting posi tions so that voltage signals induced by mutual induction between said electrodes will be opposite in phase with resp ect to each other, thereby producing a parasitic distributed constant capacitance due to a potential difference between said electrodes and a dielectric constant of said dielectric and said first electrode having a first terminal at a desired position thereof so that said electrodes form a two terminal circuit network having said first terminal with said ground or common terminals serving as a second terminal, said two terminal circuit network forming an equivalent parallel reson ant bandpass filter circuit composed of a lumped constant inductor formed by said first electrode and a parasitic distributed constant capacitor between said first and second electrodes.
