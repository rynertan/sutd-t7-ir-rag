# CASTER SHIMMY DAMPER

## Abstract
A viscous rotary damper 28 adapted to attenuate shimmy of a rotary member such as a caster comprising a yoke 13 and axle 14 relative to an associated member such as a wheelchair leg 21 , comprises a pair of relatively rotatable annular portions 29, 33 having means 31, 32 18, 40 for respective attachment to the members. The damper portions 29, 33 have annular co operative working sur faces 42, 43 of substantial length defining there between a shear film gap working chamber 41 which is closed at opposite ends by dynamic seals 44 and is substantially filled by a viscous damping medium which provides a vis cous shear coupling yieldably resisting relative rotary move ments of the working surfaces 42, 43 . The damper 28 is adapted to be of miniaturized form comprising a stator ring 29 and a rotor housing 33 , the stator ring 29 being arranged to be keyed to one 20 of the relatively rotary members and the rotor 33 being arranged to be keyed to the other 14 of the relatively rotary members.
