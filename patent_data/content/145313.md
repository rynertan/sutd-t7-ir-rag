# Bootstrap power regulator for systems such as analog to digital converters.

## Abstract
A circuit for supplying two regulated supply voltages to the amplifier comparator 40 of a recirculation of remainder analog to digital converter, comprises a series pair of transistors 84,86 connected as emitter followers. Outputs of the emitter followers 84,86 are applied to the supply terminals of the amplifier comparator 40 . The junction voltage as input between two Zener diodes 76,78 is controlled by a difference amplifier 66 . The output of the difference amplifier 66 causes the regulated supply vol tages to track a common mode signal component. Another pair of Zener diodes 72,73 between the output of the amplifier comparator 40 and the input to the difference amplifier 66 prevents saturation of the amplifier compara tor 40 .
