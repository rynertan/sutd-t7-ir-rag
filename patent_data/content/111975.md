# Television transmitter.

## Abstract
A television transmitter for transmitting signals includ ing two sound channels either for dual language or stereophonic sound transmission includes a combining filter 4 having a narrow sound passband. In order to reduce the amplitude modulation of the sound signals caused by the filter characteristic on the frequency modulated sound carriers the sound carrier signals are amplitude modulated in the opposite sense to that produced by the filter characteris tics. This is achieved by passing the modulated sound carrier signals through tuned circuits L1, C1 and L2, C2 which have their resonant frequencies and Q s appropriately chosen. By pre correcting the sound carrier signals a simpler and less expensive combining filter can be used, the additional tuned circuits required L1, C1 and L2, C2 being less expensive than a broader band combining filter since they only have to handle low power signals.
