# Liquid treatment apparatus and method.

## Abstract
A developer apparatus comrises a developing tank 10 arranged with a centrally located rotatable and vertically translatable shaft 20 carrying a workpiece platform 12 at the upper end thereof. Initially, the platform is located above the tank for ease in loading a workpiece, for example an exposed photoresist coated semiconductor device compo nent. The platform and workpiece are then lowered into developing solution in the tank where they are rotated and oscillated vertically for agitational action during a predeter mined time period after which they are raised up out of the solution and delayed with continued rotation at a drying station for another predetermined time period. Thereafter, the platform and workpiece are returned to the initial position for workpiece unloading.
