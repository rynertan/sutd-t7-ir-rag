# Foamed particles of propylene polymer.

## Abstract
Foamed particles are made by use of a volatile blowing agent, e.g. a hydrocarbon, optionally with particles of a foam regulator. The material which is foamed is a polymer of propylene of Melt Index 0.1 to 20 and is of type a or b a soft polypropylene homopolymer having a central isotactic chain of 5 mesocoupled propylene monomers so as to have mmmm partial rate by 13 The polymer is made by gas phase polymerisation preferably in a reactor at 40 100 C and 1 50 kg cmÂ² g with a usual catalyst for steroregular polymerisation. The foamed products have uniform and fine particles of apparent density e.g. 0.03 0.05 g cc and have good resist ance to heat, impact and chemicals.
