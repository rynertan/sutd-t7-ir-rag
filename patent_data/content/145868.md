# Automatic apparatus for contact pin setting in a test adapter for off grid printed circuits.

## Abstract
This machine essentially comprises a contact pin feed ing head 4 which drives contact pins 5 through holes 9, 11 in the adaptor 7 having a pair of frames 12, 23 made fast with each other, but mutually movable, each of which carry one of two parallel superimposed perforated plates 8, 10 . The relative mobility of the two frames 12, 23 , and accordingly of the two adaptor plates 8, 10 , enables align ment, as the case may be during the step of inserting each contact pin 5 , of two homologous holes along the vertical line through the contact pin feeding head 4 . The various steps are controlled by a processor which has the configura tions of the holes 9, 11 formed in the two plates, respec tively, stored therein.
