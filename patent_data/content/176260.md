# Heated fuel delivery system fitting and method.

## Abstract
A heated fuel delivery system joint and method is disclosed which is most advantageously employed in con nection with a fuel oil delivery system for a diesel engine powered motor vehicle. In such fuel delivery systems, fuel processor 18 devices are often employed to prevent fuel clouding and waxing the ice accumulation from restricting fuel flow to the engine. Even when such fuel processors are used, excessively low temperatures of fuel can cause fuel supply problems in fittings 28, 30 and conduits which connect the fuel tank 12 to the fuel processor 18 . In accordance with this invention, these fittings 28, 30 and conduits are warmed by removing a portion of the heated fuel exiting from the fuel processor 18 and introducing it into a fitting 28 at the fuel tank discharge port. By mixing the warmed fuel with cold fuel withdrawn from the fuel tank 12 , the combined temperature of the fuel is increased, thereby minimizing problems associated with excessively cold fuel. Various means are described for energizing the fuel pump such that it operates in response to sensed fuel temperature or whenever the operator of the associated motor vehicle has set the heater controls to a position to provide heat to the vehicle interior.
