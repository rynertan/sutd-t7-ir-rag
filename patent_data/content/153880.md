# Heat transfer sheet.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a novel heat transfer sheet. By providing a heat resistant protective layer comprising speci fic ingredients on a first surface of a base sheet having a heat transfer layer on a second surface thereof, there is obtained a heat transfer sheet wherein the running of a thermal head is smooth during recording wherein an image having a high density and exhibiting no surface roughness at printing areas can be provided wherein when the heat transfer sheet is wound up and stored, a dye does not migrate to the heat resistant protective layer and wherein the adhesion between the heat transfer sheet and a roll or the like does not occur within travelling apparatus.
