# Improved induction system for supercharged engine.

## Abstract
Disclosed is an induction or supercharger system 16 for a piston engine 10 having a Roots type blower 14 for supercharging an air fuel mixture from a carburetor 12 having primary and secondary throttle valves 60, 62 . The induction system includes four ducts 50, 52, 54, 56 which converge at an end into a central area or valve chamber 58 having a butterfly valving member 68 disposed therein. The other end 50a, 52a, 54a, 56a of the ducts communicate respectively with the carburetor, the supercharger inlet, the supercharger outlet, and the engine combustion chambers. The valves 60, 62, 68 are moved by a linkage mechanism 44 between positions respectively controlling air flow through the carburetor and through the four ducts to the engine. The linkage mechanism includes a lever 72 and linkage assemblies 74, 76 connected between the lever and the valves 60, 62 and 68 respectively. The linkage assemblies include springs 88, 102 which respectively move the throttle valves open and the butterfly valving member closed.
