# Process and apparatus for direct extrusion of thermal barrier profiles.

## Abstract
The process comprises the steps of providing an elongated structural member 10 having a lineal cavity therein with an open portion, driving the elongated member past a filling die 12 while simultaneously guiding the elongated member 10 so as to positively locate the open portion of the lineal cavity with respect to the filling die 12 in order to completely close the cavity at the location of the filling die, continuously extrud ing thermoplastic along the cavity through a fluid flow passage 38 in the filling die 12 , and removing a lineal portion of the structural member 10 opposite to the open portion of the lineal cavity to form the thermal barrier profile. The process may also be used to construct a composite thermal barrier pro file by providing two separate elongated structural members having portions facing and spaced from each other to form a lineal cavity with opposite open portions, driving the elongated members past a filling die 12 while simultaneously guiding the elongated members so as to positively locate the open por ions of the lineal cavity with respect to corresponding portions of the filling die in order to completely close the cavity at the location of the filling die 12 , and continuously extruding ther moplastic material along the cavity through a fluid flow pas sage 38 in the filling die.
