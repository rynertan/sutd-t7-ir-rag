# Oxygen sensor.

## Abstract
An oxygen sensor including an oxygen sensing element 11 having one closed end and inner and outer electrode layers 12 and 13 formed on the inner and outer surfaces thereof, and an output lead wire 14 electrically connected to the inner electrode layer 12 formed on the inner surface of the oxygen sensing element 11 , a metallic terminal 21 having a portion 21a urged radially into contact with the inner periphery of the inner electrode layer 12 provides the connection between the output lead wire 14 and the inner electrode layer 12 , whereby not only damage to the oxygen sensing element 11 is prevented but also the mounting operation can be done easily without screw threaded inser tion of the metallic terminal 21 .
