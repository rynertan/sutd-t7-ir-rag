# Apparatus and method for the heat treatment of materials.

## Abstract
An apparatus and method for the heat treatment of a product such as in the curing of rubber like materials and the thermoforming of plastics materials. A metallic heat transfer member 31 is provided for contacting the product to transmit heat thereto. In order to obtain a uniform tempera ture distribution over the heat transfer member product interface, one or more gas distribution passageways 33 receive hot gas from a hot gas source such as a gas burner and lead the hot gas to the heat transfer member 31 . One or more heat transfer passageways 35 contiguous with the heat transfer member 31 communicate with the gas distribution passageway 33 so as to receive hot gas from the passageway 33 and lead same to an exhaust outlet 36 .
