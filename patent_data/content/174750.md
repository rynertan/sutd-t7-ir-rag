## Abstract
A force pump is disclosed that requires no stuffing box. The pump has a riser pipe 1 and a delivery pipe 2 branched off the riser pipe between upper and lower piston assemblies 12A, 12B that operate together in the riser pipe. There are one way valves 14A, 14B , respectively below the lower piston assembly 12B and at the foot of the delivery pipe 1 . The lower piston assembly 12A incorporates a one way bypass 21 22 . The one way bypass 21 22 in the lower piston assem bly 12A and the one way valves 14A, 14B are set to open and close as fluid is pumped such that on each upstroke of the piston assemblies 12A, 12B the one way bypass 21 22 and the one way valve 14B in the delivery pipe 2 are closed and the one way valve 14A in the riser pipe is open so that by the action of the lower piston assembly 12B fluid is drawn into the riser riser through the one way valve 14A therein, and such that on each downstroke of the piston assemblies 14A, 14B the one way bypass 21 22 and the one way valve 14B in the delivery pipe are open and the one way valve 14A in the riser pipe is closed so that by the action of the upper piston assembly 12A fluid from the riser pipe is passed through the one way valve 14B in the delivery pipe to be delivered from this pipe. In addition to requiring no stuffing box, the total work input is performed during two separate strokes so that the maximum effort required of an opertor is reduced. When the pump is used to deliver water to an elevated position, or under pressure, the delivery pipe is under pressure but the resultant flooding which might otherwise occur above the upper piston assembly 12A due to water leaking past this piston assembly 12A when both assemblies are stationary or operating at low speeds is prevented by the foot valve assembly 14B at the foot of the delivery pipe 2 .

## Description
PUMP This invention relates to pumps required to lift water from a depth to be delivered to an elevated position or under pressure. In British Patent Specifications Nos. 730,097 and 1,479,595 there are disclosed pumps in each of which there is a riser pipe 19 21 in 730,097 and 20 in 1,479,595 containing upper 30 in 730,097 and 27 in 1,479,595 and lower 32 and 34 respectively piston assemblies fast by means of screw threading in 730,097 and by pins 30 and 35 in 1,479,595 on a common piston rod 31 in both specifications . There is a one way bypass 34 in 730,097 and 36 in 1,479,595 in the lower piston assembly. A delivery pipe 18 in 730,097 and 38 in 1,479,595 is branched off the riser pipe from a zone between the piston assemblies, and there is a one way valve 28 in 730,097 and 32 33 in 1,479,595 in the riser pipe below the lower piston assembly.If a pump constructed in this manner were to be used with it delivery pipe normally under pressure, as is the case where water is being pumped to a water tank at an elevated position so that the delivery pipe is supporting the water column leading to the tank and the volume of water supported could be substantial as the delivery pipe should be of large diameter to minimise friction losses during delivery strokes there would be a tendency for the water in the delivery pipe to leak back past the seals of the upper piston assembly in the piston assemblies stationary or operating at low speed conditions. Extra work would then be required to refill the delivery pipe before water could be delivered to the delivery point.Furthermore, if loss of water were to be minimised a stuffing box such as at 15 16 in 730,097 serving as a water seal between the sliding piston rod and the top of the pump body would have to be of good quality, leading to problems of construction and maintenance. According to the present invention there is provided a pump comprising a riser pipe upper and lower piston assemblies fast on a common piston rod in the riser pipe, the lower piston assembly incorporating a one way bypass a delivery pipe branched off the riser pipe from a zone that is between the upper and lower piston assemblies and a one way valve that is in the riser pipe below the lower piston assembly characterised in that said one way valve is a first one way valve, and in that there is a second one way valve that is in the delivery pipe the one way bypass in the lower piston assembly and the one way valves being set to open and close as fluid is pumped such that on each upstroke of the piston assemblies the one way bypass and the one way valve in the delivery pipe are closed and the one way valve in the riser pipe is open so that by the action of the lower piston assembly fluid is drawn into the riser pipe through the one way valve therein, and such that on each downstroke of the piston assemblies the one way bypass and the one way valve in the delivery pipe are open and the one way valve in the riser pipe is closed so that by the action of the upper piston assembly fluid from the riser pipe is passed through the one way valve in the delivery pipe to be delivered from this pipe.When this pump is used to deliver water to an elevated position, or under pressure, so that the delivery pipe is under pressure, the second one way valve in the delivery pipe serves to prevent water leaking back past the upper piston assembly, thus preventing flooding where the piston rod enters the riser pipe when the piston assemblies are stationary or operating at low piston speed. As stated above, if flooding were to occur above the upper piston assembly, extra work would be required upon the next operation of the pump to refill the delivery pipe.Also, as flooding does not occur above the upper piston assembly, and as in this pump the upper piston assembly is inactive during the upstroke, and fluid is delivered from the delivery pipe, by the action of the upper piston assembly, only during the downstroke, a stuffing box sealing the piston rod where it enters the riser pipe is not required, thus simplifying the construction. Furthermore, as the total work input is performed during two separate strokes the upstroke to lift the fluid and the downstroke to deliver the fluid the ma . effort required of the operator is reduced as compare with conventional pumps and also the maximum loading on load bearing components is reduced resulting in reduced wear and tear. For a better understanding of the invention and to show how the same may be carried into effect, reference will now be made, by way of example, to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a sectional side view of a first form of pump, Figure 2 is a sectional side view of a second form of pump, Figure 3 is a side view, to a larger scale and partly in section, of a piston assembly incorporated in the pumps of Figures 1 and 2, and Figure 4 is a view similar to Figure 3 of a valve assembly incorporated in the pumps of Figures 1 and 2. The pump of Figure 1 is a force pump for raising water and delivering it to an elevated position, or under pressure. A riser pipe 1 has a delivery pipe 2 branched off from a zone intermediate its ends, the two pipes 1, 2 depending from a mount 3. Above the mount 3 the delivery pipe 2 has a connection 4 fo receiving a pressure delivery pipe, and a delivery outlet 5 which is at an elevated position. Selection between pressure delivery, or delivery at the outlet 5, is effected by making good the connection 4 and closing a hand operated valve 6, or closing off the connection 4 and opening the valve 6. The mount 3 is supported from the ground by a stand 7. The riser pipe 1 terminates at the mount 3. A piston rod 8 having its upper end fast in a block 9 pivoted to an operating lever 10 passes through the mount 3 and into the riser pipe 1. The operating lever 10 is pivotally supported Li a post 11 upstanding fro the mount 3. Within the riser pipe 1 the piston rod 8 carries upper and lower piston asser. lies 12k, 12E, each fast with the rod Sc that they move together.The upper piston asse r. ly 2E operates above the zone at which the delivery pipe 2 is branched off the riser pipe 1.The lower pistor assembly 12B operates below this zone. At the top of the riser pipe 1 there is an overflow outlet 13. At the foot of the riser pipe 1 there is a cne wav foot valve assembly 14A. A similar one way foot valve assembly 14B is at the foot of the delivery pipe 2. The piston assembly shown in Figure 3 is the lower assembly 12B. A bolt 15 passed through the barrel 16 of the piston carries at its upper end a socket 17 in which is engaged the piston rod 8 not shown in Figure 3 . The rod 8 is made fast in the socket 17 by a pin not shown passed through a hole 18 in the socket 17, through a corresponding bore in the piston rod 8, and through a furtner hole in the socket 17. Bolt and socket are locked relative to the barrel by lock nuts 19. Around the barrel 16 there are piston rings 20.Through the barrel 16 there are axial bores 21, for example there are six such bores equally spaced around the barrel on a common pitch circle, and at the top of the barrel 16 a flap valve member 22 co operates with the bores 21 so that the bores 16 and the valve member 22 constitute a one way bypass through the lower piston assembly. The upper piston assembly 12A is similar to the lower piston assembly 72B except that it has no through bores such as the bores 21 and therefore no flap valve member or the bores are permanently blocked off.Sockets such as the socket 17 are provided above and below the upper piston assembly 12A so that the assembly can be made fast between upper and lower runs of the piston rod E. Tt,e two one way foot valve assemblies 14A, 14E are identical, and are best seen in Figure 4. Each foot valve assembly 14A, 14B conveniently has a barrel 16 which is identical with the barrel 16 of the lower piston assembly 12B except that the piston rings are replaced by a double tip seal 23 mounted in a groove that is provided intermediate the grooves that receive the piston rings when the barrel is to serve as the barrel of a piston assembly. The through bores 21 and the flap valve member 22 form the valve assembly as a one way valve. A pin 24 is permanently mounted in the opposed holey In the socket 17 for receiving a hook nct shown if lowered down the pipe 1 or 2 for recovering the foct valve assembly. Conveniently the pipes 1 and 2 are of polyvinylchloride, solvent welded together the stand 7 is of mild steel and the mount 3, block 9, lever 10 and support post 11 are of timber. In the pumps illustrated, the barrel 16 16 of the piston assemblies and the foot valve assemblies are of polyvinylchloride the piston rings 20 are of polyethylene and the flap valve members 22 and the double tip seal 23 are of natural or synthetic rubber. When mounted for operation, as shown in Figure 1 the foot of the stand 7 is set in concrete 25 at ground level, and the riser pipe 1 extends down inside a casing pipe 26 to the water 27. The foot valve assembly 14A at the foot of the riser pipe 1 is below water. Operation is as follows from the condition lower piston assembly 12E at lowest position no water above this assembly.UPSTROKE Lower piston assembly 12B rising with flap valve member 22 closed draws water into riser pipe 1 through the foot valve assembly 14b which opens to allow passage of water. Upper piston assembly 12E rising but inactive.Foot valve assembly 142 is closed. D CWNSTROYE Flap valve rettber 22 cr lower piston assembly 12S opens so this assembly inactive. Foot valve assembly 14A closes. Lpper piston assembly 12A active tc force water through foot valve assembly 7E and out through delivery e 2. Repetition of upstrokes and downstrokes repeats above cycle. As the upper piston assembly is inactive during the upstrokes, and fluid is delivered froir the delivery pipe, by the action of the upper piston assembly, only during the downstrokes, no stuffing box sealing the piston rod where it enters the lift pipe is required. By using pistons of polyvinylchloride with polyethylene sealing rings frictional resistance is ,nimised, Water leakage past the sealing surfaces a ts to lubricate these surfaces, further to c nimise frictional resstance. It can be demonstrated that leakage rate past the sealing rings is directly proportional to the delivery water head. During the downstrokes, the water flow rate past the rings of the upper piston assembly 12A is proportional to the delivery water head. This water accummulates above this piston assembly. During the upstrokes, the water flow rate downwards past the rings of the lower piston assembly 12B is proportional to the lifted water head, whilst the water accummulated above the upper piston assembly 12A tends to flow back downwards past the rings of this assembly. If the rings of the two piston assemblies 12A, 12B are identical, progressive accummulation of water above the upper piston assembly 12A occurs but only when the delivery water head exceeds the lifted water head.It is for this condition that the overflow outlet 13 above the upper piston assembly 12h is provided. If, on the other rate, the delivery water rees iE ie F ran tre lifted water ead, there is a negative accumulation of water above SE upper piston asser .A, that is air frce above this piston assembly flow downwards past the rings of the assembly during the upstrokes.During the downstrokes, this air is expelled upwards past the rings of the upper piston assembly H before the buiSd up of delivery pressure and no overflow outlet is therefore necessary for situations where the delivery water head is equal to or less than the lifted water head. It is also possible to remove the requirement for an overflow outlet for all combinations of lifted and delivery water heads, by using nen identical piston rings. The rings of the lower piston assembly 12B may be made to have a better or worse sealing efficiency than thcse at the upper piston assembly 2E, for example by varying the thickness of material cf the rings or by cutting leakage grooves in the rings, to compensate for the difference in leakage past the piston assemblies arising from a difference in lifted and delivery water heads. An alternative pressure suction configuration as shown in Figure 2 may be used to raise water from depths which are less than the maximum suction depth and to deliver the water to an elevated position or under pressure. In the pump of Figure 2, the majority of the components are as shown in the pump of Figure 1, as indicated by the use of like numerals as used in Figure 1. The riser pipe 1 in this pump has a full bore portion terminating some way above the bottom of the pipe 1 , the pipe 1 being continued below the full bore portion by a portion 1 1A of reduced diameter bore.The foot valve 14A is disposed at the bottom of the full bore portion and the piston rod 8 is shorter than the piston rod 8 of the pump of Figure 1 so that the piston assembly 12B is accaiated above the portion 1 S. cf reduced diameter bore. In the pumrr. of Figure 2 the lower piston assembly 12b and the foot valve 14A. are more readily accessible for servicing and repair than is the case in the pipe of Figure 1. In both pumps no stuffing box is required, as already discussed. Furthermore, as the total work input is performed during two separate strokes the upstroke to lift the fluid and the downstroke to delivery the fluid the maximum effort required of the operator is reduced as compared with conventioral lift pumps and aiso the maximum loading on load bearing components is reduced resulting in reduced wear and tear. When the pump is used to deliver water to an elevated position, or under pressure, the delivery pipe is under pressure but the resultant flooding which miaht otherwlse occur above the upper piston assembly due to water leaking past this piston assem bly when both assemblies are stationary or operating at low speeds is prevented by the foot valve assembly 14B at the foot of the delivery pipe 2.
