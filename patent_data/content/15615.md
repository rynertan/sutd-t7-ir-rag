## Description
Phenyl piperazine derivatives having antiagressive activity The invention relates to new phenyl piperazine derivatives, to the preparation of these compounds, and to compositions containing at least one of these compounds as an active substance. Various phenyl piperazine derivatives having a variety of pharmacological properties are knawn. For example, United States Patent Specification 2,722,529 relates to compounds of formula 1 of the formula sheet, in which Y is a straight or branched alkyl group having 2 6 carbon atoms and Z is an acyl group, a sulphonyl group or a carbamoyl group. These compounds are said to have a strong sympatholytic activity and sometimes a hypotensive effect. Furthermore, United States Patent Specification 2,833,770 discloses a group of compounds of the general formula 2 of the formula sheet, in which formula R is a chlorine atom or a bromine atom, R is a hydrogen atom or a methyl group and n is an integer of 2 5. Of these compounds also a sympatholytic effect is known. It has now been found that phenyl piperazine derivatives of formula 3 of the formula sheet, in whichR1 is a hydrogen atom, a methyl group, an alkoxy group having 1 or 2 carbon atoms, an amino group or an ureido group, R2 isa hydrogen atom or an alkyl group having 1 3 carbon atoms, R3 a halogen atom or trifluoromethyl group, T ls oxygen or sulfur atom, and m is 0 or 1, and the salts thereof, have a strong antiagressive activity. When R2 represents an alkyl group, this preferably is the methyl group or ethyl group. When R3 is halogen this preferably is fluorine, chlorine or bromine. On the basis of their activity pattern and chemical accessibility and stability, the following compounds are to be preferred 1 2 N acetylamino ethyl 4 3 chlorphenyl piperazine, 1 2 N acetylamino ethyl 4 3 trifluoromethylphenyl piperazine, 1 t2 aminocarbonylamino ethyQ 4 3 chlorophenyl piperazine, 1 2 N aminocarbonylamino ethyl 4 3 trifluoromethylphenyl piperazine, 1 2 N acetyl N methylamino ethyl 4 3 trifluoromethylphenyl piperazine, 1 2 N methoxycarbonylamino ethyl 4 3 trifluoromethylphenyl piperazine, 1 2 N thioacetylamino ethyl 4 3 trifluoromethylphenyl pipe razine, 1 2 N allophanonylamino ethyl 4 3 chlorophenyl piperazine, 1 2 N allophanoylamino ethyl 4 3 trifluoromethylphenyl pipe razine, 1 2 N acetylamino ethyl 4 3 trifluoromethylphenyl pipera zine l oxide, 1 2 N aminocarbonylamino ethyl 4 3 trifluoromethylphenyl pi perazine l oxide. It has surprisingly been found that this antiagressive activity of the compounds according to the invention is not associated with the sympatholytic properties described for the above mentioned known and structurally closely related compounds, which properties are undesired for antiagressives. Other side effects undesired also for use as antiagressives, for example, dopaminolytic, muscle relaxing and sedative properties are absent in the dosages in which the antiagressive effect occurs. It is extremely surprising that the compounds according to the invention show such a strong and in particular selective antiagressive activity, since structurally very closely related known compounds have quite a different pharmacological activity pattern. In the table below, the antiagressive activity of a few compounds according to the invention is compared with two compounds known from the United States Patent Specification 2,722,529 and with a related compound whieh falls within the scope of protection of United States Patent Specification 2,833,770. Both the new compounds according to the invention recorded in the table and the known compounds fall under the general formula 4 of the formula sheet, in which the symbols have the meanings indicated in the table TABLER4 R5 R6 T m p ED50 RemarksCH3 H 3 C1 O 0 2 1.8 new compoundCH3 H 3 CF3 O 0 2 0.7 NH2 H 3 C1 O 0 2 2.3 NH2 H 3 CF3 O 0 2 1.3 H H 3 C1 O 0 2 1.5 H H 3 CF3 O 0 2 1.7 CH3 CH3 3 CF3 O 0 2 0.9 CH3 H 3 Br O 0 2 2.6 CH3 C2H5 3 CF3 O 0 2 3.2 CH3O H 3 C1 O 0 2 3.5 CH3O H 3 CF3 O 0 2 0.6 CH3 H 3 CF3 S 0 2 1.6 NH2CONH H 3 C1 O 0 2 2.3 NH2CONH H 3 CF3 O 0 2 1.5 CH3 H 3 CF3 O 0 2 1.5 NH2 H 3 CF3 O 0 2 1.9 CH3 H H O 0 2 15 US pat. spec. 2. 722.529 ex. 12 NH2 H H O 0 3 46 ex. 7 CH3 H 2 C1 O 0 2 18 2.833.770 The ED50 values mentioned in the table were determined in a test on antiagressive activity in isolated mice Advances in Pharmacol. 5, 1967 , 79 . In this test, male albino mice were kept isolated for a period of 4 weeks and then selected for the test on the basis of fighting behaviour present. The selection criterion is the occurrence of 3 or more fighting periods within 3 minutes after a mouse which has not been kept isolated has been placed in the cage of the mouse kept isolated. The compounds to be investigated were administered orally to the selected mice. Per dose 5 mice were used.Sixty minutes after the administration of the compound to be investigated the animals were evaluated again for fighting behaviour. The compound to be investigated is inactive in the administered dose when now also 3 or more fighting periods were observed within 3 minutes after the mouse not kept isolated was placed in the cage of the mouse kept isolated. The ED50 value in mg of active substance per kg of body weight was calculated from the results obtained. It appears from the found ED50 values that the new compounds according to the invention show a much stronger antiagressive activity than the three known compounds. Since in the compounds according to the invention the sympatholytic activity and also other undesired side effects mentioned of the known compounds were not found, the new compounds are excellently suitable due to their surprisingly selective antiagressive activity pattern for being used in the treatment of agressive behaviour in m n and animal. For use in human me dicine are to be considered first of all the control of agressive symptoms in psychiatric diseases and serious forms of psychopathological agression. As application possibilities in the veterinary field are to be considered in particular those forms of agression which occur in transporting agricultural domestic animals and the mixing of groups of these animals. The quantity, frequency, and way of administration may differ for each individual case, also dependent on the nature and severity of the disturbances.
