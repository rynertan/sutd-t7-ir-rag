# Light source with colour filter.

## Abstract
A light source 30 for producing a directable beam of light comprises a frame 32 , a lamp 50,52 positioned within the frame 32 which produces light on a light path on which dichroic filters 58 64 are positioned. The dichroic filters 58 64 are pivotally mounted so that the angle of incidence of the light on the dichroic filters 58 64 can be varied to alter the colour of the light. Integrating means in the form of a lens 100 is provided for homogenizing the light passing through the dichroic filters 58 64 to produce a uniform colour.
