## Description
Homogeneous immunoassay method for determining binding substances using a macromolecular reagent and labelled antireagent and a reagent system for performing the homogeneous immunoassay to determine an analvta in a test sample BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The development of specific binding assay techn ques has provided extremely useful analytical methods for determining various organic substances of diagnostic medical, environmental and industrial importance which appear in liquid mediums at very low concentrations. Specific binding assays are based on the interaction between the substance under determination, sometimes referred to as analyte, and a binding partner thereof.Where the analyre is a hapten or antigen and its binding partner is an antibody, the assay is known as an immunoassay. Other binding interactions between the analyte and a binding partner serve as the basis of binding assays, including the binding interactions between hormones, vitamins, metabolites, and pharmacological agents, and their respective receptors and binding substances. In situations where the analyte is a binding substance, e.g., a binding protein or receptor such as an iodothyronine binding protein thyroxine binding globulin, thyroxine binding prealbumin, and the like or an antigen specific antibody, it is common to employ binding assay techniques where a labeled form of the substance that is bound by such binding substance is used. The uptake of the labeled reagent is determined by measuring the amount of label which becomes bound to the binding substance bound species or the remaining free species of the labeled reagent.Where the labeled reagent in the bound species is essentially indistinguishable in the presence of the labeled reagent in the free species by the means used to monitor the label, the bound species and the free species must be physically separated. in order to complete the assay. This type of assay is referred to in the art as 1,heterogeneous . Where the bound species and freespecies forms of the labeled conjugate can be distinguished in the presence of each other, a homogeneous format can be followed and the separation step avoided. A variety of labels have been used in assays of this type for determining binding substances. The first labels used were radioisotopes, however, because of the inconvenience and difficulty of handling radioactive materials, assay systems have been devised using materials other than radioisotopes as the label component, including enzyme cofactors, enzyme substrates, enzyme modulators, e.g., activators and inhibitors, cycling reactants, spin radicals, enzymes, bacteriophages, metals and organometallic complexes, organic and inorganic catalysts, enzyme prosthetic groups, chemiluminescent reactants, and fluorescent molecules. 2. DESCRIPTION OP THE PRIOR ART Representative of the prior art binding assays for determining binding substances based on the uptake of a labeled reagent are the following A. Radioassays employing a radiolabeled form of the substance which is the object of binding by the binding substance and requiring a distinct separation step see U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,376,11.4 3,451,777 3,615,222 3,710,117 3,711,247 3,823,001 4,211,76J 4,238,471 and 4,252,782. The main disadvantages of these radioassays are the short shelf life, handling hazards, and instrumentation requirements associated with the use of radioisotope labels. B. Nonradioisotopic, homogeneous assays employing various nonradioactive labels such as enzyme substrates, enzyme prosthetic groups, enzyme inhibitors, and enzymes see U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,134,792 4,190,496 4,238,565 4,279,992 and 4,341,865. It is also known to perform assays for binding substances by setting up a competition between a the binding substance under determination and b an antibody to a low molecular weight substance bound by such binding substance, for binding to a labeled form of such low molecular weight substance. U.S. Pat. No.4,168,207 concerns an assay for TBG wherein the sample is combined with antibody to triiodothyronine T 3 and both labeled and unlabeled T 3. The label employed is an enzyme and the assay is homogeneous since binding of enzyme labeled T 3 to the antibody results in a measurable inhibition of enzyme activity. A particularly unique and advantageous homogeneous binding assay employing labeled antibodies is described in U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 359,610, filedMarch 18, 1982, and assigned to the instant assignee.In one aspect, this assay system employs a single labeled monoclonal antibody reagent. A test sample suspected to contain the analyte of interest is combined with a labeled monoclonal antibody preparation in which antibody to the analyte is substantially the only labeled component. The label employed is selected such that a detectable response is measurably different in a qualitative or quantitative sense when the labeled antibody is bound to the analyte compared to when not so bound. The resulting detectable response is therefore a function of the analyte in the test sample. As the analyte concentration increases, there is increased binding of labeled antibody and thus increased modulation of the detectable response of the label.In one embodiment, the measurable change in the detectable response upon binding of analyte by the labeled antibody is due to steric hindrance of access of a member of a reagent detection system. A general review of the application of monoclonal antibodies in clinical immunology is provided in C2in. Chem. 27 1797 1981 . The review lists several advantages of using labeled antibodies in immunoassays and speculates on a few potential future applications of labeled monoclonal antibodies to assay systems based on proximal binding of labeled antibody pairs. The suggestion is to substitute labeled monoclonal antibodies for conventional polyclonal antibody preparations in those known assay systems employing two different labeled antibodies. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a homogenepus immunoassay involving a unique set of.reagents including a labeled antibody, or antibody fragment, for determining analytes such as binding substances in a test sample.Such reagents comprise i a macromolecular reagent capable of binding with the analyte, and ii a labeled antireagent, e.g., an antibody, capable of binding to the macromolecular reagent in a manner which is competitive with the binding of analyte with such macromolecular reagent. The label comprised in the labeled antireagent provides a detectable response which is measurably different when the labeled antireagent is bound with the macromolecular reagent compared to when not so bound. In a preferred embodiment, the reagent system also includes a chemical detection system for the label. In such embodiment, the label and detection system are selected such that the label and a member of the detection system interact to provide a detectable response which is different when the labeled antireagent is bound compared to when not bound due to steric hindrance of access of the detection system member to the label. The detectable response is then measured as a function of the analyte in the sample. The more that the analyte binds the macromolecular reagent, the less labeled antireagent is able to bind such reagent, resulting in the generation of the response according to the amount of unbound labeled antireagent. Where, as is the usual case, binding of the labeled antireagent with the macromolecular reagent results in a decrease in the amount of response generated, as more analyte binds the macromolecular reagent, the more response is generated. In a preferred embodiment, the analyte is a class of serum binders, principally TBG, for the iodothyronine hormones, e.g., thyroxine T 4 and triiodothyronine T 3 . Thus, for determining iodothyronine uptake of a biological sample, the macromolecular reagent comprises a conjugate of an iodothyronine with a macromolecular carrier material and the labeled antireagent comprises a labeled antiiodothyronine. The present method is also applicable to the determination of a variety of other binding substances, including other hormone binding proteins, tissue hormone receptors, and specific immunoglobulins. The labeled antireagent is most preferably a labeled monoclonal antibody or fragment thereof, i.e., a labeled form of an antibody, or its fragment, obtained by somatic cell hybridization techniques which yield essentially chemically pure immunoglobulin preparations. In preparing monoclonal antibody preparations for labeling, nonspecific proteins are readily and efficiently removed by subjecting the monoclonal preparation to a separation technique selective for immunoglobulins. Since substantially all immunoglobulins in t preparation will be monoclonal, i.e., chemically icerical, the separated immunoglobulin fraction will be substantially free of nonspecific components.Therefore, the resulting labeled monoclonal antireagent will exhibit a change in detectable response essentially only upon binding the macromolecular reagent. The use of labeled monoclonal antibodies in this way significantly reduces the background response that would otherwise be obtained when using labeled polyclonal antibodies, i.e., antibodies of mixed structure and origin resulting from conventional antiserum techniques. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS ANALYTE In its broadest sense, the present invention applies to the determination of any substance which has a specific binding affinity for a second substance, provided that an antibody can be prepared against such second substance and can compete with the analyte for binding to such second substance.The analyte can be any appropriate organic molecule, e.g., peptide, protein, carbohydrate, glycoprotein, steroid, and the like, and in functional terms usually will be an antigen, hapten, antibody, hormone, vitamin, metabolite, or drug, or a binding partner or receptor therefor. The present method is particularly applicable to the determination of binding substances such as binding proteins and receptors, including thyroxine binding globulin TBC , thyroxine binding prealbumin, cortisol binding globulin, estrogen receptors, ACTH receptors, avidin, cyanocobal ins, enzymes, insulin receptors, endorphin receptors, norepinephrin receptors, serotonin receptors, prostaglancin receptors, lectins, and antibodies, e.g., antibodies specific for particular antigens or haptens such as viruses hepatitis virus, CAWS, rubella , allergens, Rh factors, and drugs penicillin and the like , and autoimmune antibodies. In principle, the analyte is not limited to any particular molecular weight range, however, when applied to the determination af binding proteins and receptors, as a practical matter, the molecular weight range of the analyte will be between about 1Q,000 and 10,000,000 daltons, more usually between 25,000 and 250,000 daltons. Similarly, the binding partner which specifically binds with the analyte is not limited as to its molecular weight. In one aspect, the analyte which is the object of the present assay method comprises a class of related substances which have a specific binding affinity for a particular substance or molecule or a class of related substances or molecules Cligand . Thus, in essence, one can apply the present method to determining the capacity of a test sample to bind or take up such ligand.Stated another way, one can determine the extent of unsaturation of ligand binding sites on components of the test sample. For example, one can determine the extent of unsaturation of hormone binding proteins in a biological test sample, such as serum or plasma, where the ligand is a hormone such as an iodothyronine T 3 or T 4 . The value determined in such an assay is sometimes expressed as an uptake index, e.g., T 3 uptake or T 4 uptake. MA CROMOLECULAR REA GENT This component of the reagent system is characterized by its ability to be bound by the analyte and the antireagent. The macromolecular reagent will bear one or more sites which will accommodate the binding of either said analyte or the antireagent, but not both simultaneously. In this way, a competition can be established between the analyte and labeled antireagent for binding to such binding sites on the macromolecular reagent, with the amount of label which becomes affected by binding of labeled antireagent to the macromolecular reagent being a function of the amount of competing analyte present. The macromolecular reagent will be characterized by its ability to effect modulation of the detectable response produced by the label in the labeled antireagent upon binding therewith. Such modulation will normally be caused by the size of the reagent and or the presence of label modulating elements on the reagent as will be described more fully below. Within the above parameters, the macromolecular reagent can take a wide variety of forms. This reagent will have a minimum size of about 5,000 daltons in order to be capable of inducing steric hindrance of the label upon binding with the labeled antireagent and or of carrying label modulating elements. Usually, the macromolecular reagent will have a molecular weight greater than about 10,000 daltons, and preferably greater than 50,000 daltons. The minimum size of the reagent useful in a given reagent system will be dependent upon the exact nature of the labeled antireagent selected and the desired performance characteristics of the assay, e.g, sensitivity. The maximum size of the macromolecular reagent is essentially unlimited and will be selected based strictly on the preferences of the designer of the reagent system. .15 1235 Where there exists in nature a substab v will bind with the analyte, for which an antireagent can be prepared, and which is sufficiently macromolecular greater than 5,000 daltons such substance itself can serve as the macromolecular reagent. Such a situation often is encountered in biological systems wherein the analyte is a binding protein or receptor for a relatively large molecule such as certain protein hormones, e.g., chorionic gonadotropin, insulin, growth hormone, follicle stimulating hormone FSH , luteinizing hormone LH , thyroid stimulating hormone TSH , and prolactin. Likewise, an antigen can be used as the macromolecular reagent where the analyte is an antibody, for example, in the case of determining antibodies specific to certain viruses, allergens, Rh factors, and the like.Furthermore, the macromolecular reagent can be an antibody, or fragment thereof, which binds to the analyte, which in such case will be a relatively low molecular weight hapten e.g., 100 1500 daltons or an antigen e.g., 1000 10,000,000 daltons . In such a situation, the antireagent will be selected from antibodies raised against the antianalyte antibody, or fragt, and which will bind at or sufficiently near the combining site of the antianalyte so as to significanzly inhibit binding of both analyte and antireagent to the antianalyte macromolecular reagent simultaneously. The antireagent can be an antiidiotipic antibody or the like and can be conveniently prepared by monoclonal techniques. Alternatively, or in a case where the analyte has a specific binding affinity for a relatively small molecule, e.g .s less.than about 2000 daltons, one can prepare a suitable macromolecular reagent by forming a polymer or aggregate of such ligand or a conjugate of such ligand with a macromolecular carrier. Such a conjugate will comprise one or more ligands bound to a carrier molecule of molecular weight at least .15 1285 greater than 5,000 daltons, usually greater than 10,000 daltons, and preferably greater than 50,000 daltons. The ligands will be bound to the carrier in such a manner that the conjugate is substantially stable under the conditions of the assay. In the usual case, the ligands will be chemically l inked by covalent bonds to the carrier molecule.The wide variety of materials that can serve as the carrier material and the wide variety of methods for bonding the appropriate ligand or ligands thereto are well within the skill of the ordinary worker in the field. The carrier material can be soluble or insoluble in the test sample and reaction mixture, although it will generally be preferable to employ soluble, usually water solubie, carrier materials which can be uniformly dispersed in the reaction mixture. However, even insoluble, porous or nonporous, materials in the form of resins, gels, plastic strips, bibulous pads, and even the surface of the reaction vessel itself, can serve as the carrier for the macromolecular reagent.The shape of the carrier material is not critical and is primarily a matter of choice for the designer of the reagent system. Clearly, an extremely wide variety of materials can serve as a macromolecular carrier since its principle purpose is simply to impart a minimum size to the molecule which is the object of the competitive binding between thebinding substance analyte and anti reagent.A brief, but certainly not exhaustive, list of materials which can be used as the carrier material includes proteins e.g., albumins and globulins , polypeptides, polysaccharides, synthetic and naturally occurring organopolymers such as celluloses, including modified celluloses such as carboxymethylcellulose, hydroxypropl cellulose, and DEAE cellulose, starches, agar, agarose, dextran, gelatin, polyvinylalcohols, polyethyleneimine, synthetic poly amino acids such as polylysine, polyglutamic acid, and the like. At least one, and normally several, ligands are bound to the carrier material. The number of ligands bound to a particular carrier material will vary from 1 to the number of linking sites available on the carrier according to the needs of the assay involved. LABELED A STI REA GENS Binding of the macromolecular reagent to labeled antireagent results in a measurable change, either a decrease or an increase, in the detectable response produced by the label. Preferably, the label is elected to provide a sterically sensitive detectable assay response upon interaction, e.g., chemical reac town, with a member of a chemical detection system comprising one or more substances which interact with te label to generate the measured signal.In such assay systems, the masses of the labeled antireagent c d the macromolecular reagent will be selected such z the mass of the labeled antireagent will be sig cantly increased upon binding of the macromolecular rrent. As the relative mass of the macromolecular reagent becomes larger, the steric effects in the environment of the label become more pronounced, and titus, more readily detectable. In the usual case, the label itself will preferably be small, e.g., of molecular weight less than 50,000, generally less than 10,000, more usually less than 4,X00, and preferably less than 2,000, and the detection system member or members with which it interacts will preferably be significantly larger, e.g., more than 3 times larger, more usually 10 times larger, and preferably 20 to 100 times or more larger than the label. Accordingly, in the most preferable systems with labels having masses of the order of 100 to 2,000 daltons, at least one member of the detection systemMS 1285 with which the label must interact to provide the detectable signal will be of the order of lQ,OOQ to 200,000 daltons or greater.Such size relationship between the label and the detection system member increases the probability of a significant steric effect upon binding of macromolecular reagent with the labeled antireagent. Preferred labels therefore are participants in an enzyme catalyzed reaction, such as enzyme substrates, coenzymes, enzyme prosthetic groups, and enzyme inhibitors, since a wide variety of enzymic reactions are available from which to chose assay components. Many small substrates, coenzymes, and inhibitors are known for enzymes of sufficiently large molecular weight to have the preferred size relationship between label and its interacting detection system member.This applies likewise for prosthetic groups. and their corresponding apoenzymes. Similarly, many enzymes are known which have significantly larger substrates or for which artificially large substrates, coenzymes, or inhibitors can be prepared by coupling small substrates, coenzymes, and inhibitors to high molecular weight backbone materials such as water soluble polymers. As alternatives to, or in combination with, the steric effects on the label, one can design the macromolecular reagent with which the labeled antireagent binds to comprise label modulating elements, i.e., chemical groupings or components which interact with the label when proximate thereto to modulate the detectable response. Such proximal effects are well known in the art of homogeneous binding assays, for example, see Coin. Chem. 27 1797 1806Ç1981 . For instance, one of the antireagent and the macromolecular reagent can comprise a light emitting element, e.g., a fluorescent, chemiluminescent, or phosphorescent group, and the other can comprise an appropriate light absorbing element that quenches and or reemits light of a distinct character. Commonly, such systems will involve fluorescence or chemiluminescence quenching seeU.S. Pat.No. 4,160,016 and J. Coin. Path. 30 526 1977 , or energy transfer see U.S. Pat. No. 3,996,345 .Fluorescence polarization can also be utilized where one of the antireagent and macromolecular reagent comprises a fluorescer and the other is of a sufficiently larger size that a fluorescence polarization difference can be detected upon binding of the two assay components. see J. p. Med. 122 1209 1975 and Immunocher. 7 799 1970 . Another proximal effect approach in . olves enzyme channeling and the like where one of the antireagent and macromolecular reagent comprises ote component of an enzyme system and the other comprises a second component of such enzyme system wherein s me product of the enzymatic reaction is produced at a rate dependent upon the proximal relation of the two enzyme system labels.Such enzyme system labeling pairs c n involve, for example, two different enzymes where te product of a reaction catalvzed by one is a sub Pirate for the other, an enzyme and its substrate or a factor or inhibitor, or an apoenzyme and its sthetic group see U.S. Pat. No. 4,233,402 . Where the modulation effect is due to steric h rance, the label comprised in the antireagent can be any substance which interacts with another molecule or molecules a member of the chemical dejection system to give a detectable response, where such interaction is sterically sensitive, that is where binding of the macromolecular reagent to the laeled antireagent sterically hinders the responseproducing interaction. Specifically preferred labels are those described in detail in the aforementionedU.S. Patent Application Serial No. 359,610, and briefly include enzyme substrate and coenzyme labels, U.S. Pat.No. 4,279,992 and U.K. Pat. Spec. 1,552,607 enzyme prosthetic group labels U.S. Pat. No. 4,238,565 enzyme modulator Ce.g., inhibitor labels, U.S. Pat.Nos. 4,134,792 and 4,273,866 enzyme labels, U.S. Pat.Nos. 3,817,837 and 4,043,872 chemically excited fluorescent labels, U.S. Pat. No. 4,238,195 and epitope labels, U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,935,074 and 3,998,943. The steric effects produced by the binding of the macro molecular reagent and the labeled antireagent are enhanced by selecting antireagents having masses that will be significantly increased by complexation with the macromolecular reagent. In general, the antireagent preferably will be smaller than 10 times the mass of the reagent, more usually smaller than the absolute mass of the reagent, and more preferably smaller than 0.25 times the mass of the reagent. The mass of the antireagent can be decreased by selecting antibodies of an immu..globulin class which have relatively low molecular seights, e.g., IgG antibodies have molecular weights around 150,000 whereas those of the Ig class have molecular weights around 900,000.Also, one can selectively cleave antibodies to give fragments of lower molecular wes hich retain their specific binding affinity, e.g.. various fragments of IgG antibodies can be prepared such as Fab 50,000 daltons F ab 53,000 daltons, and Flab 2 106,000 daltons . In all embodiments, antireagent which is labeled is an immunologicalls rived binding substance capable of binding with the macromolecular reagent in competition with the analyte. The antireagent normally comprises whole antibodies, or appropriate fragments or aggregates thereof, raised against the binding sites epitopes on the macronolecular. reagent to which the analyte also binds. Thus, where the macromolecular reagent comprises an antigen or other naturally occurring macromolecular ligand to which the analyte binds, antireagent is raised against such ligand.The resulting antibodies are screened for competition with the analyte for binding to such ligand. Where the macromolecular reagent comprises a conjugate of ligands with a macromolecular carrier as described above, antireagent is raised against the ligand, or if haptenic, against a ligand immunogenic carrier conjugate as is known in the art. When in the. form of whole antibody, antireagent can belong to any of the classes and subclasses of known immunoglobulins, e.g., IgG, IgM, IgE, and so forth. Any fragment of any such antibody which retains specific binding affinity for the macromolecular reagent can also be employed, for instance, the fragments of IgG conventionally known as Fab, F ab , ane F ab 2. In addition, aggregates, polymers, and cons gates of immunoglobulins or their fragments can be used where appropriate. Such poly antireagent can be pr pared in any available manner so as to maintain binds affinity for the reagent.Other forms of antireage . can be employed so long as the material selected has 2 specific binding affinity for the reagent concerned. The immunoglobulin source for the antireagent c be obtained in any available manner. Usually, antireagent immunoglobulin will be obtained by conventior antiserum techniques or monoclonal techniques. Antiserum containing antireagent is obtained by well established techniques involving immunization of an animal, such as a rabbit, guinea pig, or goat, with an appropriate immunogen. State of the art reviews are provided by Parker, Radjoimmunoassay of Biologically Active Compounds, Prentice Hall Englewood Cliffs,New Jersey, U.S.A., 1976 , Butler, J. Immunol. Bees. 7 1 24 1975 Weinryb and Shroff, Drug Metab. Rev. 10 271 283 1975 Broughton and Strong, Clin. Chem. 22 726 732 1976 and Playfair et al, Br. Med. Bull. 30 24 31 1974 . Monoclonal antireagent is preferably used for the reasons stated previously. Monoclonal antibodies are chemically homogeneous and are obtained by somatic cell hybridization techniques see Lymphocyte Hybri domain, ed. Melchers et al, Springer Verlag New York 1978 and Methods in EnzymoLogy 73 Part B 3 47 1981 . In general, monoclonal antireagent immunoglobulin is produced by fusing lymphocytes which produce such antibody with nonsecreting myeloma cells to form hybridomas, isolating a hybridoma clone which secretes the desired antibody, and harvesting the secreted monoclonal antibody. The lymphocytes involved in hybridization are commonly spleen cells removed from an animal such as a mose or a rat which has been immunized in the conventional manner against the pertinent epitopes on the maromolecular reagent. The selected label is linked in any conventional manner to the antireagent to form the labeled component of the present invention. A wide variety of means for linking the two elements are available and known in the art. The linkage can be covalent and involve a single chemical bond or a chain comprising from l to 50 atoms, more commonly I to 30 atoms, and usually 1 to 20 atoms, excluding hydrogen, principally composed of carbon and heteroatoms selected from nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, and sulfur. Conventional linking groups are described at length in the literature. See for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,230,797 4,279,992 3,817,837 ,935,074 and 3,996,345.The linking group can be comprised of a side arm group put on the label for the purposes of spacing and or functionalizing the label for coupling to the antireagent and or the residue from a bifunctional coupling agent used in linking the label or derivatized label to the antireagent. Since the label is associated with antireagent in the present invention, it is necessary to achieve a relatively high degree of purity for the antireagent preparation which is subjected to labeling conditions or else significant nonspecific labeling can occur resulting in background label responses.Affinity purified conventional antiserum can be used, but monoclonal antibody preparations are especially preferred. Once a monoclonal antireagent preparation as cites fluid our tissue culture fluid has been obtained, a fraction containing essentially only immunoglobulin is separated from the other proteins that may be present.Such separation can be accomplished in any available manner. Preferably, affinity chromatography techniques are applied to this task. As affinity binding partner on the chromatography column canbe used anti antireagent which usually will be an antibody to the class of immunoglobulin to which the desired antireagent belongs, e.g., anti IgG, or a fragment thereof. h hile not a preferred method, one can also use the reagent itself or the ligand as the affinity binding partner.A preferred affinity chromatography technique employed the substance commonly referred to as protein A, a protein obtained from StaphyZococcus aureaus which has the unique property of binding specifically to IgG immunoglobulins J. Immunol. 97 822 1966 and Immunol. 103 828 1969 . Protein A is commercially available as the isolated protein or attached to gel particles suitable for use as an affinity chromatography column matrix Protein A Sepharose, Pharmacia Fine Chemicals,Piscataway, New Jersey, USA . The use of protein A to separate antireagent from the monoclonal preparation is particularly advantageous. Since the only immunoglobulin present in the monoclonal preparation is antireagent, one need only apply techniques that separate immunoglobulins and it is assured that only antireagent will be isolated. The purified antireagent preparation is then labeled according to the particular detection system that is desired. The label, as described above, is coupled to antireagent in any available manner. Since the only protein substantially present in the purified antireagent preparation is antireagent, the labeling substance can be efficiently and specifically attached to antireagent therein by reaction under conditions that form covalent bonds between the labeling substance and proteins in general. This ability to use standard protein modification reactions to label antireagent without concern for nonspecific labeling of proteins is particularly advantageous. One or more labels can be attached to an individual antireagent molecule and, where the nature of the label allows, vice versa. Ordinarily, the antireagent will carry between 1 and 30, more usually between 1 and 20, labels per molecule of antireagent. While it is desirable to have multiple labels per antireagent to enhance sensitivity, too high a labeling density can affect the ability of antireagent to effectively bind with reagent. In the case where the label is relatively large and polyfunctional, such as an enzyme, multiple antireagents can be attached to a single label. Binding to the reagent leads to the formation of lattices due to bonding of a single labeled antireagent conjugate to multiple reagent molecules, each of which in turn can be bound by labeled antireagent, leading to increased steric hindrance at or near the label. REACTION MIXTURE AND CONDITIONS The test sample to be assayed can be a naturally occurring or artificially formed liquid suspected to contain the analyte, and usually is a biological fluid or a dilution thereof. Biological fluids that can be assayed include serum, plasma, urine, saliva, milk, and amniotic and cerebrospinal fluids. The assay reaction will in almost all case s be allowed to proceed under mild conditions. The order of addition of the macromolecular reagent and labeled antireagent, and where used, the detection system, is not critical, provided that the complete detection system and label are not permitted to generate significant response in the absence of sample an the reagent.In general, the reaction mixture will be an aqueous medium with any desirable organic cosolve ts being present in minor amounts. The temperature of the reaction will be maintained at a constant level in normal circumstances throughout the incubation period and the measurement step. Temperatures will generally be between 5 and 50 C, more usually between 2û and 409C. Preferably, the reaction will proceed at rcm temperature. The pH of the reaction mixture will vary between 5 and 10, more usually between 6 and 9. The concentration of various reagents will depend on te level of analyte expected in the test medium, with such level usually being between 10 A and i 12M. As in the case of the previously described reaction parameters, selection is primarily based on empirically derived optimization balanced against the preferences and needs of the technician who will ultimately perform assays on a routine basis. None OI the parameters therefore is of a critical nature to the present invention, rather they are all within the ordinary skill in the art.

The ascites fluid it milliliter ml , stored at 200C prior to use, was applied to a 4 ml l cm x 5 cm column of Protein A Sepharose 4B CPharmacia FineChemicals, Piscataway, New Jersey, USA equilibrated with 20 mM Bicine N,N bis 2 hydroxyethyl glycine3, pH 8.2, containing 0.048 sodium azide at room temperature. The column was washed with 15 ml of this Bicine buffer, followed by 15 ml of the same Bicine buffer containing 0.1 molar M sodium chloride NaCl and then 15 ml of Bicine buffer with no NaCl. The antibody was eluted by washing the column with 0.1 M glycinehydrochloric acid HCl buffer, pH 3.0.Test tubes receiving this acid eluate contained 100 microliters ul of 1 M Bicine, pH 8.5, to raise the pH immediately.The column was finally washed with 15 ml of Bicine buffer, to return it to pH 8.2. The absorbance at 280 nanometers A280 of the 100 drop fractions was monitored and fractions containing the antibody were pooled and concentrated to about 1 ml using a Millipore CX 10 immersible ultrafiltration device. The concentrated antibody solution was chromatographed on Sephadex G25 fine Pharmacia to remove glycine. The antibody solution àbout 1 ml was applied to an 80 ml 1.5 cm x 45 cm Sephadex G 25 fine column equilibrated with 20 mM Bicine, pH 8.2, containing 0.04 sodium azide at room temperature. The A280 of the 100 drop fractions was monitored and fractions containing the antibody were pooled and concentrated, as before, to 2 ml. B.
