## Abstract
A gas powered motor 33 has a reservoir 28 for liquefied gas, a supply passage from the reservoir leading through one side of a heat exchanger 29 to the motor and a container 52 holding a buffer substance in heat conductive relationship with the reservoir. The buffer substance acts to supply heat to the liquefied gas whilst undergoing a chemical, physical crystallographic or other change of state to assist in maintaining the supply of gas to the motor 33 from the reservoir 28 . In order to preserve the gas supplied to the motor for re use without the need of a container of substantial volume the motor exhaust leads to a vessel 36 containing a condensing buffer substance 37 which condenses the gas by adsorbing, persorbing or otherwise associating with the gas accompanied by a release of heat. The condensing buffer substance is in heat conductive relation with the other side of the heat exchanger 29 in the gas supply to the motor to superheat the gas supplied. The condensing buffer substance is capable of releasing the gas when subjected to reduced pressure by a pump 50 provided which may be the gas motor 33 run in reverse to extract the gas from the vessel 36 and return it to the reservoir 28 . In another embodiment the condensing buffer substance comprises an isothermal heat sink provided, for example, by a concentrated salt colution.
