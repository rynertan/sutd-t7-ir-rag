# A dispersible pigment composition, its preparation and use in the coloration of thermoplastic materials and paints.

## Abstract
A dispersible inorganic pigment composition in which the surface of a finely divided inorganic pigment is coated with a substance which renders the surface hydrophobic and then with a thermoplastic polymer and a process for the pre paration of the composition. The composition is readily dis persible in thermoplastic materials and plants and it can be used to colour thermoplastic materials directly avoiding the preparation of a master batch.
