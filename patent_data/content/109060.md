## Description
PROCESS FOR THE CONVERSION OF OLEFINS HAVING FROM 4 TO 12CARBON ATOMS TO PROPYLENE The invention concerns a process for the conversion of olefins having from 4 to 12 carbon atoms into propylene. Nowadays huge amounts of olefine cuts, from C4 to C12, linear or branched, are available throughout the world and they are widely employed for different purposes, such as described for instance in Italian patent publications 24152 A 82, 24550 A 82 and 19292 A 83. Sometimes, however, because of contingent reasons, even outside the chemical field, like for instance transportation difficulties, it would be better to have still further possibilities of use. A promising use of said olefins would be their conversion into propylene and or ethylene. However, endurance tests have shown that the excellent initial behavior of some catalysts, like for instance ZSM5 and ZSMll, disappears after some time after a few weeks conversion and selectivity drop to poor levels. An object of the invention is to provide a process for catalytically converting olefin cuts C4 C12 with high propylene and optionally also ethylene yields and with a long life time of the catalyst before substitution or regeneration. In its most general form, the invention concerns a process for the conversion of olefins having from 4 to 12 carbon atoms into propylene which is characterized in that said olefins are brought into contact with a zeolitic compound optionally in admixture with a binder selected from silicalites, boralites, chromosilicates and those zeolites ZSM5 and ZSMll in which SiO2 A1203 by moles is 350, at a space velocity of from 5 to 200 kg h of olefins per kg of pure zeolitic compound, binder excluded, and at a temperature of from 400 to 6000C, said zeolitic compound being used as such or in a modified form. The behavior of silicalites depends on the conversion pressure for instance, if the silicalite is silicalite l and if the pressure is substantially atmospheric, the space velocity must be lower than 50 h 1 if said compound is silicalite l and if the pressure is from 1.5 to 7.5 absolute atmospheres the space velocity must be in general above 50 h 1 Best results are obtained when said catalytic silicalite l is activated in the conversion reaction of the ole fins into propylene, under said operative conditions. This initial activating run takes at least 8 and preferably 12 hours the silicalite l is used as such or in a modified form and the modifying element is selected from Cr, Mg,Ca, Sr and Ba. The modifying element can be incorporated into the catalyst by means of ion exchange or by any other method, for instance impregnation or co precipitation during the I sis of the zeolitic compound. According to a particularly advantageous way for the preparation of a non modified silicalite, the raw product coming from the zeolite synthesis is dried, for instance at 120 C, calcined e.g. at 5400C for some hours , in order to remove all the residual organic templating agent, and then exchanged with an aqueous solution of HC1, NH4Cl, NH4NO3 or an equivalent H or NH4 source. When an ammonium compound is used, it is necessary to heat, e.g. at 400 C, in order to obtain the acid form of the silicate. A surveyof techniques alternative to ion exchange is given e.g. in U.S. patents 3,140,249 3,14A251 3,140,253 and inEuropean patent publications 30796, 36707, 37168, 40463, 68754. The zeolitic material, after calcination and conversion into the acid form, shows a long endurance and a very high catalytic activity. These zeolitic compounds can be used as catalysts as such or in a modified form optionally in admixture with suitable amounts of binders, for instance SiO2 or A1203. A list of other binders can be found e.g. in European patent publication 36707. The regeneration1 can be carried out in air for some hours, at 400 6000C. A steam regeneration is described in European patent publication 36704 and according to a further and very successful method, the catalyst can be regenerated by a hydrogen treatment. As to the initial activation of the catalyst, some methods are described in European patent publications 34444 and 35830 in general it is advisable to activate the catalyst for some hours in air, at 450 7500C preferably 540 700 C . Furthermore the conversion itself of olefins to propylene has an activating effect on the zeolitic catalyst. In other words, catalyst and reaction affect each other in a mutual, reciprocal and beneficial activating reaction. Any process for the conversion of more or less heavy olefinic cuts into propylene will be indicated hereafter, as a post pyrolysis process. When the feed of a postpyrolysis process is a mixture of olefins having 4 C atoms, there is a considerable problem to be solved, because theC4 cuts always contain substantial amounts of paraffins, in general, also having 4 C atoms, which paraffins pass at 400 600 C the zeolitic bed without taking part in any reaction. Furthermore a small amount of C4 paraffins is produced by the post pyrolysis process itself. The conversion to C3H6 could be enhanced by a recycle of the nonreacted C4olefins or of the C4 olefins formed during the reaction. In such a case, however, an increasing accumulation of n butane and of isobutane would take place.This drawback could be avoided by a separation of paraffins from olefins before feeding the reactor but such a separation is rather difficult. Butenes and isobutane cannot be isolated by a simple distillation and it is usually necessary to carry out an extractive distillation a complicated technique , which is particularly burdensome for the C4 cuts coming from catalytic cracking, where butane and isobutane may account for even 50 of the whole. The problem, however, can be solved in a surprisingly easy way by the process according to the invention, when employing an integrated oligomerization step.In other words, a particular embodiment of the invention the feed being a parafX fin olefin mixture comprises the following steps reference is made also to figure 2 a preliminary oligomerization of a C4 C4 mixture at a temperature of from 320 to 3800C using a catalyst bed of zeolitic nature see e.g. U.S. patent 4,150,062 to obtain a mixture of olefins having from 5 to 8 C atoms, with the C4 paraffins remaining unconverted b cooling and condensation of the oligomerization effluent in order to separate the Cq paraffins as a gaseous phase, and conversion of the remaining C 5 C8 mixture to propylene under typical post pyroly 8 sis operative conditions c cooling of the effluent from the reactor for the conversion to propylene and compression of said 2 effluent, preferably at 13 16 absolute Kg cm whereby the hydrocarbons having 4 or more C atoms are condensed and the hydrocarbons having less than 4 C atoms are separated as a gaseous phase. These hydrocarbons C4 can be advantageously recycled to a conventional battery of distillation columns for thermal or catalytic cracking, in order to recover all the propylene contained therein. The small and possible amounts of aromatics BTX can be easily separated from the other C4 hydrocarbons and recycled together with the final C4 Cs mixture, containing small amounts of butanes produced during the conversion reaction described under item b above. In order to carry out the oligomerization, C4 olefins, containing C4 paraffins in any proportion, are initially brought into contact with a catalyst of zeolitic nature, for instance ZSM5 or ZSMll, in an acid or in a modified form, at 250 4000C preferably 320 3800C and at space velocities from 2 to 10 preferably 4 8 kg h of reactants.per kg of pure zeolite binder excluded . In other words, the olefins of the C4 C4 mixture are converted almost totally into a C5 C8 olefinic mixture, while butane and isobutane do not react. The separation of the butanes can thus be carried out very easily by simple cooling with water at room temperature.The olefinic C5 C8 mixture liquifies while the butanes are separated as a gaseous phase, said C5 C8 mixtures being optimal raw materials for the production of propylene. Depending on the operative conditions of the synthesis of the silicalite,as e.g. the dilution of the starting solutions, the resulting crystallites may have a widely variable. size. The crystallites to be employed in the process according to the invention should have, in general, rather small sizes, such small sizes being obtainable, for instance, following the teachings of U.S. patent 3,926,782.The following examples are given merely for illustration purposes and do not in any way limit the scope of the in vent ion.OPERATIVE CONDITIONS COMMON TO ALL EXAMPLES As to the method of preparation of the catalysts see for silicalite l U.S. patent 4,061,724 for boralite Taramasso et al. Molecular Sieve Borosi licates , Proc. 5th Int. Conf. on Zeolites, Naples 1980, pages 40 48 Heyden and Son Ltd. London 1980 the bora lite used in the examples has a ratio SiO2 B203 of 7 by moles a more recent method for obtaining boro sili Cates is described in European patent publication 77946 for chromosilicates Italian patent publication 22568 A 82, in the name of the Applicant the chromosilicate used in the examples has a ratio Six 2 Cr2O3 of 38 by moles . As to zeolites ZSM5 showing a very high SiO2 A1203 ratio, not exemplified, see Italian patent publication 21699 A 83, in the name of the Applicant. In the absence of different indications, all the catalysts were activated 2 hours at 5400C before being used. EXAMPLES 1 6 3 g of zeolitic catalyst, in admixture with 0.9 g ofSiO2 as a binder , were loaded into a microreactor which was continuously fed, at a pressure slightly above atmospheric pressure with a 50 50 mixture of butene 2 trans and butene 2 cis. Operative conditions and results are given in Table 1.EXAMPLE 7 Example 4 was repeated using a silicalite l impregnated with a chromium salt, thus obtaining slightly better results.EXAMPLES 8 15 0.5 g of zeolitic catalyst, in admixture with 0.21 g of A1203 as a binder , were loaded into a microreactor which was continuously fed, at a pressure slightly above the atmospheric pressure with a 70 100 mixture of n pentene and of helium by moles . Detailed operative conditions and results are given in Table 2. When modified zeolitic catalysts were used, the modifying element was added by means of impregnation.EXAMPLES 16 23 Examples 8 and 9 were repeated replacing pentene with n hexene ex. 16 and 17 , with 2 methyl pentene l ex. 18,1 19 and 20 and with n octene l ex. 21, 22 and 23 , respectively, the parameters being slightly modified as indicated in Table 3, which shows also the very good results.EXAMPLES 24 29 2.12 g of zeolitic catalyst were loaded into a microreactor which was continuously fed whith 7.5 kg h of isobutene per kg of zeolitic catalyst at 5500C and at a pressure slightly above atmospheric pressure. Data and results are given in Table 4.EXAMPLES 30 AND 31 Examples 24 and 25 were repeated raising the pressure to 5 absolute atmospheres and the space velocity WHSV from 7.5 to 45 h 1 thus obtaining analogous results. EXAMPLES 32 35 3 g of silicalite l, without binder, were loaded into a microreactor which was continuously fed with 60kg h of the olefins of example 1 per kg of silicalite, at high pressure 6 absolute atmospheres for example 32 and 33 and 8 abs.atm. for ex. 34 and 35 . The detailed operative conditions and the results are given in Table 5. The results show clearly that a slight increase in pressure, corresponding approximately to the pressure of the olefins in the industrial manufacturing plants, allows the same conversions and selectivities, but at a much higher velocity. In other words, it is surprising and was quite unexpected that a suitable increase of the pressure increases very much the productivity of the silicate and therefore the output of the industrial plants.EXAMPLE 36 50 parts by weight of silicalite l were admixed with 50 parts of A1203 binder and the mixture was loaded into a microreactor which was continuously fed at atmospheric pressure, with a 50 50 mixture of butene 2 trans and butene 2 cis, at 5500C and at a space velocity of 20 kg h of olefins per kg of silicalite binder excluded . The run was very long 120 h and the results, hour by hour, were continuously monitored and plotted in figure 1. It is worthwhile to note that the initial decrease of conversion is reversed after a few hours thus the conversion of the olefins itself is likely to be a stimulating activation for the catalyst. In other words, catalyst and reaction effect each other by a mutual and beneficial activating action.EXAMPLE 37 Example 36 was repeated by using a mixture 65 b.w.silicate l 35 b.w. Al2O3 and by raising the space velocity to 67 h 1. In this case, the conversion initially decreased and then the phenomenon was reversed.
