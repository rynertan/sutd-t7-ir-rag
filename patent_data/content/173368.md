# A THERMAL IMAGING DEVICE AND A METHOD OF MANUFACTURING A THERMAL IMAGING DEVICE

## Abstract
A thermal imaging device comprising a ferroelectric or pyroelectric slab 1 bearing an infra red permeable common electrode 2 on one main surface and a signal electrode structure 3 on the opposite main surface. The signal electrode structure 3 is electrically connected to electrodes 12 of a circuit substrate 13 by means of solder bumps 14 fused to conductors 8 surrounded by a thermally insulating material. A problem in such thermally imag ing devices is the heat conducted transverse to the longitudinal axes of the conductors 8 so that cross talk occurs between adjacent sensing regions. The transverse heat conducting be tween adjacent conductors is reduced by using conductors which are each in the form of a metal coating 8 on a bore 7 in a respective pillar 10 of thermally insulating material, the pillars 10 being defined by channels 9.
