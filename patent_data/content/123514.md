# Endoprosthetic bone joint devices.

## Abstract
An endoprosthetic acetabular component of overall cup form has three parts an outer part 10 for securement in bone, an inner part 20 defining a dished articulation surface 23 and adjustably engageable with the outer part to allow independent variation of such surface in both inclination and rotation, and a third part 30 to secure the inner and outer parts with a preselected adjustment of the former. The inner outer part engagement is preferably of spherical bear ing form. Also, the inner part is preferably of two sub parts 21, 24 respectively providing the articulation surface and the outer part engagement, the former sub part being selectable from a range interchangeably connectable with the latter sub part but having respectively different heights of articula tion surface.
