## Description
POLYMERIC FERRO ELECTRIC MATERIALField of the Invention The present invention relates to a polymeric ferro electric material. Particularly, it relates to a polymeric ferro electric material comprising a vinylidene fluoride trifluoroethylnene copolymer and having improved ferro electric properties, particularly specific permittivity, piezoelectricity and pyroelectricity after poling.Background of the Invention A ferro electric material has a Curie s point and shows a hysterisis loop in a plotting curve of polarization against intensity of electric field. Accordingly, such the material has strong remanent polarization. When the material is ferro electric, it has piezoelectric and pyroelctric properties. Piezoelectric or pyroelectric properties are properties that crystals of a material are electrically polarized corresponding to stress or thermal atress applied to the material. With the piezoelectric property, mechanical energy can be transformed to electric energy, and vice versa. The larger piezoelectric constant means better transformation efficiency, and therefore a material having the larger piezoelectric constant is more preferred as the piezoelectric material. Typical piezoelectric materials are ceramics and some polymers. Among the polymers, generally fluorinecontaining polymers have better piezoelectric property. In addition to the good piezoelectric property, the fluorine containing polymers have several preferable properties such that they are formed in a thin film having a large surface area and they can be mass produced. Recently, the fluorine containing polymers are, therefore, used in the acaustic field as a component of a head phone or a loudspeaker for high pitched sound. Among the fluorine containing polymers, polyvinylidene fluoride hereinafter referred to as PVdF has a comparatively larger piezoelectric constant and has been studied vigorously both in fundamental research and in application research. As is well known, PVdF has three crystal forms, namely alpha, beta and gamma forms. Among them, only the beta form PVdF has such a large piezoelectric constant as is practically used. However, a PVdF film manufactured by means of a film extruder, which is most convenient for mass production of a polymeric film at a low cost, has the alpha crystal form and only a very poor piezoelectric property. In order to convert the alpha formPVdF to the beta form one, it is necessary to stretch the former by several times. Further, the film should be heat set to prevent shrinkage.The thus stretched PVdF film has anisotropy and its piezoelectric constant d31 is usually about 10 to 15 pc N. It is also known to manufacture the beta crystal PVdF by casting a solution of PVdF in an appropriate solvent. This method entails a problem using complicate processing and only affords a PVdF film having a piezoelectric constant of 10 to 15 pC N. The piezoelctric constant of the cast PVdF film may be increased to 30 to 40 pC N by a certain unusual process such as zone stretching Murakami et al, Polym. Pre. Prints, 29, 524, 1980 .However, this process is not efficinent and not suitable for commercial production. Copolymer of vinylidene fluoride hereinafter referred to as VdF and trifluoroethylene hereinafter referred to as TrFE is recently noted as a new piezoelectric material. The molecular structure in the crystal of the copolymer takes always trans trans conformation with or without stretching and the piezoelectric constant of the extruded film as such is 10 to 15 pC N, which can be increased by about 1.5 times by stretching and heat set. Electronic devices are required to be smaller and thus a capacitor as an element of the electronic devices must be made smaller. Capacity of the capacitor is calculated according to the following equation C so S d wherein Âµis specific permittivity of a dielectric mate rial, Eo is specific permittivity of vacuum 0.0885 pF cm ,S is a surface area of the capacitor and d is a thickness of the capacitor. As is clear from the above equation, E andS must be made large and d must be made small in order to obtain the capacitor having smaller size and larger capacity. Although the polymeric material is easily made in a form of the thin film having a large area as discussed above, its specific permittivity is as small as 2 to 5. In order to produce a small capacitor having high performance, a dielectric polymeric material having large specific permittivity is required. The copolymer of VdF and TrFE is known as a highly dielectric polymeric material cf . Japanese Patent Publication unexamined No. 69000 1977 . The specific permittivity of the VdF TrFE copolymer is about 15 at room temperature and 1 KHz , which is 1.5 to 2.0 times larger than that of PVdF which has been known as a good dielectric polymeric material. As a result of the extensive study on the ferroelectric property, particularly piezoelectric and dielectric properties of VdF TrFE copolymers, it has now been found that a VdF TrFE copolymer of which a crystlline melting endothermic peak and melting sub peak on a crystalline melting chart measured with a differential scanning calorimeter hereinafter referred to as DSC satisfy a certain requirement has specific permittivity of at least 25 at 240C and 1 KHz and piezoelectric constant of at least 40 pC N after poling.Summary of the Invention According to the present invention, there is provided a polymeric ferro electric material comprising aVdF TrFE copolymer film which has such a crystalline melting endothermic peak Tm on a crystalline melting chart measured with DSC that the peak measured in the first run is broader than the peak which is measured in the second run under the same conditions as in the first run with the film cooled to a room temperature after the first run. Some of the copolymers according to the invention have a melting sub peak Tm at a lower temperature side of the crystalline melting peak Tm on the crystalline melting chart but others do not. When the sub peak is present on the chart, the sub peak measured in the first run is narrower than that measured in the second run. Preferably, the copolymer contains 45 to 70 by mole of VdF.Brief Description of the Drawings Fig. 1 shows a set of heated rolls to calender the copolymer film Fig. 2 shows two typical crystalline melting.charts of the copolymers according to the invention measured by means of DSC Fig. 3 shows a procedure to calculate a half value of the endothermic peak in the crystalline melting chart Fig. 4 shows the changes of specific permittivities with temperature of the copolymers of Example 2 andComparative Example 3 Fig. 5 shows the crystalline melting charts of the copolymers of in Example 2 and Fig. 6 is a graph showing d31 plotted against the drawing. ratio.Detailed Description of the Invention The polymeric ferro electric material according to the invention may be prepared by calendering the copolymer film which has been formed by, for example, melt extrusion by means of a set of heated rolls kept at a temperature higher than a room temperature and lower than the melting point of the copolymer, preferably from 100 to 1400C and rotated at 0.1 to 10 rpm with the distance between the rolls of not more than about 100 micrometers as shown in Fig 1.Usually, the thus calendered film is stretched at a draw ratio of 2 to 10. Shapes of the crystalline melting endothermic peakTm and the sub peak Tm if present measured in the first and second runs are greatly different as shown in Fig. 2. Such differences may be expressed quantitatively by half width of the melting endothermic peaks and of the sub peaks recorded in the first and second runs. The half width of the endothermic peaks is calculated from the DSC chart as follows As shown in Fig. 3, firstly, a base line A B is drawn and then a vertical line is drawn from the maximum point C to the temperature axis. D designates the intersection of the vertical line and the base line. From the middle point E between the points C and D, a line parallel to the temperature axis is drawn. The intersections of the parallel line and the DSC melting curve are F and G. The length of the segment F G is the half width. Each half width quantitatively expresses the shape of the endothermic peak on the DSC chart measured under the same conditions and is compared with others. The ratio K of the half width of the melting endothermic peak Tm in the second run to the one measured in the first run is less than one since the latter is broader than the former.The copolymer having K value of less than one has specific permittivity of at least 20 at 240C and 1 KHz and piezoelectric constant of 40 to 50 pC N after poling. The polymeric film according invention is subjected to poling treatment to impart piezoelectric property to the film. The poling is carried out by a per se conventional method. The poling conditions are as follows Temperature 80 to 1200C, preferably about 1000C Electric field strength 30 to 50 MV m, preferably about 40 MV m Time 20 to 40 minutes, preferably about 30 minutesPreferred Examples of the Invention The present invention will be hereinafter explained further in detail by following Examples. Example 1 and Comparative Example 1 Films of the VdF TrFE copolymers containing 52 by mole, 54 by mole, 65 by mole and 73 by mole comparative respectively were calendered by means of the rolls as shown in Fig 1 kept at 1200C to give the sample films.Each film was subjected to the first measurement by DSC and cooled to a room temperature.
