## Description
TITLE OF THE INVEI T1ON Substituted aminophenyl compounds and acylaminophenyl compounds and pharmaceutical compositions containing them.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Cholecystokinin CCK is a neuropeptide composed of thirty three aminoacids. See Mutt andJorpes, Biochem. J. 125 678 1971 . The carboxyl terminal octapeptide CCK 8 also occurs naturally and is fully active. CCK exists in both gastrointestinal tissue and the central nervous systems. V. Mutt, Gastrointestinal Hormones, G. B. 3.Glass, Ed., Raven Press, N.Y., p. 169. CCK is believed to play an important role in appetite regulation and CCK may be a physiological satiety hormone. G. P. Smith, Eating and Its Disorders, A.J. Stunkard and E. Stellar, Eds, Raven Press, NewYork, 1984, p. 67. Among additional effects of CCK are stimulation of colonic motility, stimulation of gall bladder contraction, stimulation of pancreatic enzyme secretion, and inhibition of gastric emptying. CC reportedly co exists with dopamine in certain mid brain neurons and thus may also play a role in the functioning of dopaminergic systems in the brain, as well as serving as a neurotransmitter in its own right. See A. J. Prange et al., Peptides in theCentral Nervous System , Ann. Repts. Med. Chem. 17 31, 33 1982 and references cited therein J. A.Williams, Biomed. Res. 3 107 1982 and J. E.Morley, Life Sci. 30, 479, 1982 . CCK antagonists are useful in the treatment and prevention of CCK related disorders of the gastrointestinal, central nervous and appetite regulatory systems of animals, especially humans. Three distinct chemical classes of CCK receptor antagonists have been reported. One class comprises derivatives of cyclic nucleotides detailed structure function studies have demonstrated that of the various members of this class, dibutyryl cyclic GMP is the most potent. See N. Barlos et al., Am. J. Physiol., 242,G 161 1982 and P. Robberecht et al., Mol.,Pharmacol., 17, 268 1980 . The second class comprises peptide antagonists which are C terminal fragments and analogs of CCK.Recent structurefunction studies have shown that both shorterC terminal fragments of CCK Boc Met Asp Phe NH2,Met Asp Phe NH2 as well as longer CCK fragments Cbz Tyr S03H Met Gly Trp Met Asp NH2 can function as CCK antagonists. See R. T. Jensen et al., Biochem. Biophys. Acta., 757, 250 1983 and M.Spanarkel et al., J. Biol. Chem., 258, 6746 1983 .The third class of CCK receptor antagonists comprises the amino acid derivatives proglumide, a derivative of glutaramic acid, and the N acyl tryptophans including para chlorobenzoyl L tryptophan benzotript . See W. F. Hahne et al., Proc. Natl.Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 78, 6304 1981 and R. T. Jensen et al., Biochem. Biophys. Acta., 761, 269 1983 .All of these compounds are relatively weak antagonists of CCK IC50 10 4 10 6M generally, 10 4M but down to 10 6M in the case of peptides . The peptide antagonists have substantial stability and absorption problems.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It has now been found that compounds ofFormula I are antagonists of cholecystokinin CCK .These CCK antagonists are useful in the treatment and prevention of CCK related disorders of the gastrointestinal, central nervous and appetite regulatory systems of mammals, especially humans.The compounds of Formula I are also gastrin antagonists. They are useful in the treatment and prevention of gastrointestinal ulcers.

In the compounds of Formula I, the preferred stereochemistry relates to L tryptophan, whereC X7 RÚ , and R of Formula I occupy the positions of the carbonyl group, the a amino group, and the indolymethyl side chain, respectively, ofL tryptophan. As used herein, the definition of each expression, e.g. m, n, loweralkyl, etc., when it occurs more than once in any structure, is intended to be independent of its definiton elsewhere in the same structure. As used herein, halo is F, C1, or Br loweralkyl is 1 4 carbon straight or branched chain alkyl and includes methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, and t butyl in loweralkoxy and loweralkylthio, the alkyl portion is loweralkyl as previously defined cycloloweralkyl is cycloalkyl of 3 5 carbons loweralkenyl is 1 5 carbon straight or branched chain alkenyl and acyl is formyl, acetyl propionyl, or butyryl. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of Formulas I include the conventional non toxic salts or the quarternary ammonium salts of the compounds of Formula I formed, e.g., from non toxic inorganic or organic acids. For example, such conventional non toxic salts include those derived from inorganic acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, sulfamic, phosphoric, nitric and the like and the salts prepared from organic acids such as acetic, propionic, succinic, glycolic, stearic, lactic, malic, tartaric, citric, ascorbic, pamoic, maleic, hydroxymaleic, phenylacetic, glutamic, benzoic, salicylic, sulfanilic, 2 acetoxybenzoic, fumaric, toluenesulfonic, theophylline, 8 chlorotheophylline, p aminobenzoic, p acetamidobenzoic, methanesulfonic, ethane disulfonic, oxalic, isethionic, and the like. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the present invention can be synthesized from the compounds of Formula I which contain a basic or acidic moiety by conventional chemical methods.Generally, the salts are prepared by reacting the free base or acid with stoichiometric amounts or with an excess of the desired salt forming inorganic or organic acid or base in a suitable solvent or various combinations of solvents. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the acid of Formula I are also readily prepared by conventional procedures such as treating an acid ofFormula I with an appropriate amount of a base, such as an alkali or alkaline earth metal hydroxide e.g. sodium, potassium, lithium, calcium, or magnesium, or an organic base such as an amine, e.g., dibenzylethylenediamine, trimethylamine, piperidine, pyrrolidine, benzylamine and the like, or a quaternary ammonium hydroxide such as tetramethylammonium hydroxide and the like. An embodiment of this invention is the preparation of compounds of Formula I. Another embodiment is the use of the compounds of Formula I for the treatment and the prevention of disorders of the gastrointestinal, central nervous, and appetite regulatory systems of mammals, especially of man. Specifically, theFormula I compounds are useful in treatment and prevention of disorders of gastric acid secretion, gastrointestinal motility, pancreatic secretions, and dopaminergic functions. The compounds of Formula I are especially useful in the prevention and treatment of irritable bowel syndrome. A further embodiment is a composition comprising an effective amount of a compound ofFormula I and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The ability of the compounds of Formula I to antagonize CCK and gastrin makes these compounds useful as pharmaceutical agents. These compounds will be especially useful in the treatment and prevention of disease states wherein CCK or gastrin may be involved, for example, gastrointestinal disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome, ulcers, excess pancreatic or gastric secretion, acute pancreatitis, motility disorders, central nervous system disorders caused by CCK s interaction with dopamine such as neuroleptic disorders, tardive dyskinesia, Parkinson s disease, psychosis or Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome, and disorders of appetite regulatory systems. The compounds of Formula I or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, can be administered to a human subject either alone, or preferably, in combination with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or diluents, in a pharmaceutical composition, according to standard pharmaceutical practice. The compounds can be administered orally or parenterally. Parenteral administration includes intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous and topical administration. For oral use of an antagonist of CCX or gastrin of this invention, the selected compound can be administered, for example, in the form of tablets or capsules, or as an aqueous solution or suspension. In the case of tablets for oral use, carriers which are commonly used include lactose and corn starch, and lubricating agents, such as magnesium stearate, are commonly added. For oral administration in capsule form, useful diluents are lactose and dried corn starch. When aqueous suspensions are required for oral use, the active ingredient is combined with emulsifying and suspending agents. If desired, certain sweetening and or flavoring agents can be added. For intramuscular, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous and intravenous use, sterile solutions of the active ingredient are usually prepared, and the pH of the solutions should be suitably adjusted and buffered.For intravenous use, the total concentration of solutes should be controlled to render the preparation isotonic. When a compound of Formula I or a salt thereof is used as an antagonist of CCX or gastrin in a human subject, the daily dosage will normally be determined by the prescribing physician. Moreover, the dosage will vary according to the age, weight, and response of the individual patient, as well as the severity of the patient s symptoms. However, in most instances, an effective daily dosage will be in the range from about 0.05 mg to about 50 mg kg and preferably 0.5 mg to about 20 mg kg in a single or divided doses. On the other hand, it may be necessary to use dosages outside these limits in some cases. The compounds of Formula I are prepared according to the following schemes. REACTION SCHEME IEMI13.1 REACTION SCHEME IIEMI14.1 paratoluenesulfonate ester REACTION SCHEME IIIEMI15.1 REACTION SCHEME III cont d EMI16.1 REACTION SCHEME IVEMI17.1 2 Aminoarylketones 1 where X8 C 0 , preferably 2 aminobenzophenones, l amino 2 Nsubstituted aminobenzenes 1 where X8 NR10 , preferably 1 amino 2 arylaminobenzenes, or 2 substituted anilines 1 where R8 CH2Rê , preferably 2 substituted phenylmethyl anilines, each containing various substituents in the aryl rings, preferably halo substituents, are coupled toN protected L amino acids preferably Boc L amino acids, using dicyclohexylcarbodiimides DCC , or other conventional peptide coupling reagent, to give the amides 2. 2 may be deprotected, preferably with HC1, to give the amines 6 and these may be akylated by treatment with alkyl halide or dialkyl sulfate or acylated by treatment with acyl halides or anhydrides, preferably in the presence of a base such as triethylamine or the like, to give the alkyl or acyl derivative 7. Alternatively, 6 may be obtained from 1 directly by acylation with an L amino acid chloride hydrochloride in the presence or absence of a base such as triethylamine. The N protected compounds 2 may first be alkylated on the aniline nitrogen by treatment with sodium hydride in dimethylformamide DMF , followed by an alkyl halide, to give the alkyl derivatives 3.These may be deprotected as described for 2 above to give the amines 4 which may be alkylated or acylated, again as described above, to give 5. Alternatively, compounds 1 may be reacted with an alkyl halide or sulfonate ester to give the amines 8 which may also be alkylated at the aniline nitrogen, as described for 2 above, to give the compounds 9. Alternatively, compounds 1 may be treated with an epoxide to give the carbinolamines 10 which may also be alkylated at the aniline nitrogen to give the compounds 11. When compounds 1 are coupled to anN protected L amino acid which is Boc L tryptophan, the product 2 obtained is that shown by structure 12. Deprotection with HC1 and coupling with Boc Gly using DCC, converts 12 to 13. Similar deprotection and coupling of 13 with Boc L Met gives 14, and another deprotection and coupling with Cbz L Tyr provides 15. Treatment of 15 with pyridine sulfur trioxide complex or other sulfating reagent gives the O sulfate 16. Reduction of ketones 17 with sodium borohydride gives the carbinols 18. Alternatively, treatment of 17 with hydroxylamine provides the oximes 19 which are reduced with sodium cyanoborohydride in acidic medium to the hydroxylamines 20. In cases where the starting materials are optically active, the chiralilty et the carbon bearingR , R10, and R13 is controlled by the synthesis. When racemic starting materials are employed, racemic products are obtained. The enantiomers may be separated by resolution.In Vitro Activity of Formula I The biological activity of the compounds ofFormula I have been evaluated using an 125I CCK receptor binding assay and in vitro isolated tissue preparations. Materials and Methods 1. CCX Receptor Binding Pancreas CCK 33 was radiolabeled with 125I BoltonHunter reagent 2000 Ci mmole as described bySankara et al. J. Biol. Chem. 254 9349 9351, 1979 . Receptor binding was performed according toInnis and Snyder Proc. Natl. Acad.

The 125 latter two compounds have no effect on the I CCX receptor binding assay. Male Sprague Dawley rats 200 350g were sacrificed by decapitation. The whole pancreas was dissected free of fat tissue and was homogenized in 20 volumes of ice cold 50 mM, Tris HC1 pH 7.7 at 250 C with a Brinkmann Polytron PT 10. The homogenates were centrifuged at 48,000 g for 10 min.Pellets were resuspended in Tris Buffer, centrifuged as above and resuspended in 200 volumes of binding assay buffer 50 mM Tris HC1, pH 7.7 at 250C, 5 mM dithiothrietol, 0.1 mM bacitracin, 1.2 mM phenylmethane sulfonyl fluoride and 0.5 mM o phenanthroline . For the binding assay, 25 ul of buffer for total binding or unlabeled CCK 8 sulfate to give a final concentration of 1pM for nonspecific binding or the compounds of Formula I for determination inhibition of 125I CCX binding and 25 ul of 125I CCK 33 30,000 40,000 cpm were added to 450 p1 of the membrane suspensions in microfuge tubes. All assays were run in duplicate or triplicate.The reaction mixtures were incubated at 370C for 30 minutes and centrifuged in a Beckman Microfuge 4 minutes immediately after adding 1 ml of ice cold incubation buffer. The supernatant was aspirated and discarded, pellets were counted with aBeckman gamma 5000. For Scatchard analysis Ann.N.Y. Acad. Sci. 51 660, 1949 , 1251 CCX 33 was progressively diluted with increasing concentrations of CCK 33. 2. CCX Receptor Binding Brain CCK 33 was radiolabeled and the binding was performed according to the description for the pancreas method with modifications according to Saito et al., J.

Male Hartley guinea pigs 300 500g were sacrificed by decapitation and the brains were removed and placed in ice cold 50 mM, Tris HC1 plus 7.58 g l Trizma 7.4 pH 7.4 at 250C Cerebral cortex was dissected and used as a receptor source. Each gram of fresh guinea pig brain tissue was homogenized in 10 ml of Tris Trizma buffer with a Brinkman polytron PT 10. The homogenates were centrifuged at 42,000 g for 15 min. Pellets were resuspended inTris Buffer, centrifuged as above and resuspended in 200 volumes of binding assay buffer 10 mM N 2 hydroxethyl piperazine N 2 ethane sulfonic acid HEPES , 5 mM MgC12, 0.25 mg ml bacitracin, 1 mM ethylene glycol bis ss aminoethyl ether N,N tetraacetic acid EGTA , and 0.4 bovine serum albumin BSA .For the binding assay, 25 ul of buffer for total binding or unlabeled CCK 8 sulfate to give a final concentration of 1pM for nonspecific binding or the compounds of Formula I for determination inhibition of I CCK binding and 25 ul of 125I CCK 33 30,000 40,000 cpm were added to 450 ul of the membrane suspensions in microfuge tubes. All assays were run in duplicate or triplicate. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 250C for 2 hours and centrifuged in a Beckman Microfuge 4 minutes immediately after adding 1 ml of ice cold incubation buffer. The supernatant was aspirated and discarded, pellets were counted with a Beckman gamma 5000. The compounds of Formula I can be determined to be competitive antagonists of CCX according to the following assays. 3. Isolated guinea pig gall bladder Male Hartley guinea pigs 400 600 g are sacrificed by decapitation. The whole gall bladder is dissected free from adjacent tissues and cut into two equal halves. The gall bladder strips are suspended along the axis of bile duct in 5 ml organ bath under 1 g tension. The organ bath contains a Kreb s bicarbonate solution NaCl 118 mM, KC1 4.75 mM, CaCl 2.54 mM, KH2PO4 1.19 mM, Mg SO4 1.2 mM, NaHCO3 25 mM and dextrose 11 mM maintained at 320C and bubbled with 95 O2 and 5 CO2.Isometric contractions are recorded using Statham 60 g 0.12 mm strain gauges and a Hewlett Packard 77588 recorder. The tissues are washed every 10 minutes for 1 hr to obtain equilibrium prior to the beginning of the study. CCK 8 is added cumulatively to the baths and EC50 s determined using regression analysis. After washout every 10 minutes for 1 hr , the compound of Formula I is added at least 5 minutes before the addition of CCK 8 and the EC50 of CCK 8 in the presence of the compound of Formula I similarly determined. 4. Isolated longitudinal muscle of guinea pig ileum Longitudinal muscle strips with attached nerve plexus are prepared as described in Brit J.Pharmac. 23 356 363, 1964 J. Physiol. 194 13 33, 1969. Male Hartley guinea pigs are decapitated and the ileum is removed 10 cm of the terminal ileum is discarded and the adjacent 20 cm piece is used . A piece 10 cm of the ileum is stretched on a glass pipette. Using a cotton applicator to stroke tangently away from the mesentery attachment at one end, the longitudinal muscle is separated from the underlying circular muscle. The longitudinal muscle is then tied to a thread and by gently pulling, stripped away from the entire muscle. A piece of approximately 2 cm is suspended in 5 ml organ bath containing Krebs solution and bubbled with 95 O2 and 5 CO2 at 370C under 0.5 g tension. CCK 8 is added cumulatively to the baths and EC50 values in the presence and absence of compounds of Formula I determined as described in the gall bladder protocol above .In Vitro Results 1.
