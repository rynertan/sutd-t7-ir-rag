# Foundry sand binder compositions.

## Abstract
A binder composition for binding foundry sand particles to form moulds and cores in sand mould casting processes, which may be aluminium alloy casting processes, comprising a ther mosetting resin and powdered zinc carbonate which is dis persed in the resin and, while the moulds and cores are heated by the poured molten metal, undergoes thermal decomposition with generation of carbon dioxide gas which aids the moulds and cores to become readily disintegratable. The zinc carbonate is present in the composition in an amount of from 0.5 to 30 by weight based on the weight of the thermosetting resin. The invention also provides a coated sand composition comprising a major proportion by weight of a foundry sand and a minor proportion by weight of a binder composition in accordance with the invention, the particles of sand being coated with the binder composition.
