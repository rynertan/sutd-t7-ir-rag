The compounds of this invention possess useful antihypoxia activity, that is, they extend the lifetime of animals exposed to a hypoxic environment. This activity is conveniently measured in mice. Groups of mice are tested at various times after the intraperitoneal administration of graded doses of the test compound. The animals survival time in a hypoxic environment 96 nitrogen and 4 oxygen is recorded. .A statistical comparison Wilcoxon rank sum is made between coincident vehicle treated animals and the experimental group. The dose response, time course and minimum active dose MAD for a compound are obtained.Other modes of administration can also be used.
