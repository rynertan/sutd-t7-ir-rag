## Description
DescriptionThe present invention relates to a method for controlling memory components. In particular, the present invention relates to a method for controlling memory components of 16K x 1 bit or 64K x 1 bit by the use of a data bus and a control bus adapted for components of 4K x 1 bit.The invention further relates to a memory circuit board making use of this method. A circuit board of this type is particularly, although not exclusively, intended for installation in a device for the inspection and testing of electronic components. Apparatus for the inspection and testing of electronic components is manufactured for instance by the Fairchild Co. USA and marketed under the designation Sentinel, Sentry VII, Sentry VIII etc..The circuit boards according to the invention may be installed as original parts or as replacement for the original circuit boards installed in such apparatus. The present invention offers the advantage of being capable of replacing four conventional circuit boards equipped with components of 16K x 1 bit, or eight conventional circuit boards equipped with components of 64K x 1 bit.Conventional memory circuit boards are normally used in two groups each containing at least one circuit board up to a maximum of twelve circuit boards. Each of these circuit boards has a storage capacity of 8K words. They are in the form of printed circuits of the read and write memory type RAM wit a capacity of 8K words of 24 data bits and 1 parity bit.The method according to the invention permits the function ality of the conventional circuit boards to be obtained while reducing the number of components to a quarter or to one eigbtth in the case of printed circuits of 32K words, or 64K worms, respectively. The reduction of the number of components er.rfflo eo on a circuit boars according to the invent or. sl s in Increased reliability of the memory system of the apparatus, with the consequent reduction of failure probability.It is thus an object of the invention to provide a circuit board of the type defined above, which is capable, depending on the installation configuration, to replace one to eight circuit boards of the conventional type without requiring any modification of the hardware of the apparatus.In the following, the memory circuit board according to the invention shall be considered as a unitary entity irrespective of whether it is equipped with 16 K components or with 64K components As a matter of fact, the circuitry of the circuit board permits the memory components to be interchangeable while remaining itself unchanged, so as to selectively provide an overall storage capacity of 32K words or 64K words, depending on the memory components employed.For the control of components of 32K or 64K, the invention provides the employ of a known data bus and a known control bus adapted to components of 4K. The method according to the invention provides the employ of a a data bus for dynamic memories of 4K for addressing and exchanging data with a bus formed with memories of 16K or 64K b a control bus for circuit boards of 8K for the control of circuit boards of 32K or 6 K. The function defined under a , above, is obtained by employs ing particular temporary storage components latch assc ciated with the data bus. These components permit to circumvent the fact that the memories of 16K or 64K do not retain the data in the buffer for a sufficient time for being acquired by the processor of the apparatus.The function defined under b , above, is obtaIned by the application of a novel operating logic which permIts the selection of the circuit board carryIng a s Itable circuit thereon, and additionally the generatIon of memory refresh addresses independent of those supplied by the processor of the apparatus.The present invention is thus embodied in a method for controlling memory components of 16K x 1 bit or 64K x 1 bit by using a control bus adapted to components of 4K x 1 bit, which is characterized in that a memory refresh signal is generated which is independent of the one supplied by the system.On the other hand, the present invention is embodied in a memory circuit, particularly, but not exclusively, in a memory circuit board for an electronic component inspection or testing system, said circuit board having a capacity of 32K or 6hK words of 24 data bit and 1 parity bit, said circuit board further having two memory blocks, two address buffer blocks, one line access signal decoder block, one line or column address selection block, one refresh address generator block, one input data acquisition block, one line address acquisition block, one column address acquisition block, one bank selection block, and one enter signal control block, said memory circuit board being characterized by further comprising a refresh signal generator block, a block for the acquisition of data provenient from the memory components, a control signal processing block, and a circuit board selection block, said refresh signal generator block operating in accordance with the method defined above.Embodiments of the invention shall now be described by way of non limiting example with referece to the accompanying drawings, wherein fig. 1 shows an overall block diagram of a circuit board according to the invention, fig.2a shows a diagram of a stored data refresh block, fig.2b shows the operation of this block, fig. 3a and 3b show in particular the transfer of a datum from a memory component to the bus of the system, fig. 4 shows the manner in which the circuit board select ion signal is generated, and figs. 5, 6 and 7 show the read cycle, the write cycle, and the memory refresh cycle, respectively.Shown in fig. 1 are the functional blocks constituting a circuit board according to the invention, including two memory blocks designated BANK A and BANK B, respectively.These blocks form the central nucleus of the circuit to which the function is assigned of storing the data supplied to the memory by the central processing unit CPU.These memory blocks together comprise 50 components of 16K x 1 bit or 25 components of 64K x 1 bit, depending on whether the circuit has a capacity of 32K or 64K words. These components are advantageously in the form of dynamic RAMs realized for instance in the single feedH MOS technology. The data are supplied to the two memory banks through the acquisition block DATA IN LATCH. The data may be retrieved from these banks as required through the acquisition block DATA OUT LATCH for supply to the bus of the CPU. The ROW ADDRESS LATCH and COLUMN ADDRESSLATCH blocks acquire the row and column addresses, respectively for selecting the memory location frown which a datum is to be read or into which it is to be written. The row addresses, column addresses and refresh addresses are supplied during different phases to the memory banks A and B through the ADDRESS MUX block.The BANK SELECT block decodes the three most significant addresses for selecting the memory bank in which or from which, respectively, the data are to be stored or retrieved.The RAS DECODE block opens the passage to the RAS signal row address selection signal and applies it to the two memory banks during the refresh phase, or to the active babk during the read or write phase.The blocks RAS CAS BUFFER and CAS BUFFER impose on theRAS and CAS signals characteristics enabffllng then to on temporaneously control all of the installed memory components.The BOARD SELECT block decodes the four most significant addresses on the base of which the memory circuit is selected by the CPU.The REFRESH TIMING and REFRESH ADDRESS GENERATOR blocks generate the refresh addresses and apply them to the memory components in synchronism with the phase T1 cf.figs. 2a and 2b of the system, and independent of the refresh signal supplied by the CPU.The INTERNAL LOGIC block regulates the signals supplied by the control bus and cooperates with the WRITE LOGIC block for selecting the transit direction of the data.Fig. 2a shows in greater detail the interrelation between the INTERNAL LOGIC and REFRESH TIMING blocks.Shown therein is the signal REF for incrementing the refresh address counter. This signal, which is fundamental for the operation of the circuit boards according to the invention, is generated in the following manner The signal T1 supplied in the example shown by the CPU is retarded respectively by 50 ns 250 ns 650 ns and 750 ns by delay elements DL1 and DL2. The delays by 50, 250, 650 and 750 ns are merely indicative as they may vary by as much as 50 in each case. The delay indicated at 50 ns may thus vary between 30 and 80 ns, the delay indicaetd at 750 ns may vary between 700 and 820 ns, the delay indicated at 250 ns may vary between 150 and 350 ns, and the delay indicated at 650 ns may vary between 500 and 700 ns.In the present example, only four delay values are shown, it is also possible, however, to employ a number of different values including multiplicators and or combinators. With the delays indicated there are thus obtaiend four signals, which through combination by means of the logic gate G2 and flip flop D generate the signal Q. During the period of time in which TC is at a high level this signal is converted by the logic gate G5 into the signal REF, i.e. the memory component refresh signal. The signal TC rises from the low level to the high level every eight pulse T1.As in the present example the repetition period of T1 equals 1,75 us, REF is accordingly activated every 8 x 1,75 us. And as there are 128 row addresses to be refreshed, each row is activated every 179 us, as is necessary for the correct functioning of the employed memory components.In prior art the signal REF is supplied by the CPU every 26,25 us, and is adapted to refresh memory components having a structure of 64 rows by 64 columns 4K . A refresh signal obtained according to the invention permits the employ of memory components of 16K x 1 bit or 64K x 1 bit.As a result, a circuit board according to the invention can replace four to eight prior art circuit boards.As regards the row address acquisition signal RAS, it is shown in fig. 2a how this signal is generated, during the refresh cycle, by the gate G1 by combining TC with T1 650ns.In addition, and still during the refresh phase, the gateG3 obstructs the row acquisition signal SRAS supplied by the CPU.Fig. 3a shows the manner in which, according to the invention, a datum from one memory component MEM is transferred to the system bus SYST BUS read phase . ObservIng the timing as represented in fig. 3b, it is noted that the datum MDOUT retrieved from the memory component MEMis transferred to the system bus via the components LATCH andBUFFER when the said datum is no longer valid at the output of the memory component. In prior art arrangements employing components of 4K the component LATCH is internal of the memory component.Shown in fig. 4 is the manner in which, according to the invention, the board selection signal r, is obtained. This figure shows a iicleer component NUX and a series of twelve bridges J1 J12 . The component MUX decodes the most significant addresses A14 A27 , associating a respective bridge to each possible configuration thereof.Depending on wether the bridge is or is not installed, the signal BEN assumes at least the logic state zero and becomes the board selection signal. In prior art the selection of a circuit board is conversely accomplished by suitable connections, external of the circuit board, and only adapted to circuit boards carrying memory components of 4K. Figs. 5, 6 and 7 show the timing sequences of the various signals. In particular, fig. 5 shows the read cycle, fig. 6 shows the write cycle, and fig. 7 illustrates the refresh cycle.
