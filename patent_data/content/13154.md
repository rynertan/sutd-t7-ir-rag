# Method of and apparatus for runnerless injection compression molding thermosetting materials.

## Abstract
Method of and apparatus for compression molding requires a thermosetting molding material, suitably a synthe tic resin composition such as a phenolic molding composi tion, to be initially heated and plasticized. The plasticized mass is passed as a stream through an injection nozzle 17 which is maintained at a temperature sufficiently high to keep the mass in a plasticized condition but sufficiently low to avoid any substantial curing or setting up of the mass. The plasti cized mass is next passed through a temperature controlled manifold 33 maintained at a temperature sufficiently high to keep the mass in a plasticized condition but sufficiently low to avoid any substantial curing or setting up of the mass. In the manifold the plasticized stream is divided into two or more smaller streams which are passed through a plurality of out lets 61, 79 into a plurality of partially open, heated molds 41, 47 . The mold cavities are maintained at temperatures suffi ciently high to cure the thermosetting molding material. When the partially open molds are full, the feed stream is interrupted, and the molds are then completely closed to press and cure the plasticized material enclosed within them.
