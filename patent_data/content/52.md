# Chlorination or chlorosulfonation of polyethylene in mixed solvent.

## Abstract
A process for chlorinating or chlorosulfonating polyethylene comprising dissolving polyethylene in a solvent that is a mixture of methylene chloride and trichloro fluoromethane in a weight ratio of 0.3 1.6, reacting the resultant solution with sulfuryl chloride under pressure to maintain reactants, the resulting chlorinated or chlorosulfonated polyethylene and product gases in a single liquid phase, reducing the pressure on or increasing the temperature of the single liquid phase of chlorinated or chlorosulfonated polyethylene and solvent to form two liquid phases, one a polymer rich phase and the other a solvent rich phase, and separating the phases.
