# Electrochemical cell.

## Abstract
Electrochemical cell having a battery stack 20 of an electrode assembly wound on a spool 21 . The electrode assembly includes two elongated electrode structures, an anode electrode structure 32 and a cathode current collec tor structure 31 . The spool 21 has a central post 25 of insulating material and two conductive flanges 22 and 23 . The two electrode structures 31 and 32 are wound around the post 25 with insulating material 33 between them, the anode electrode structure 32 making contact with one of the flanges 22 and the cathode current collector structure 21 making contact with the other flange 23 .
