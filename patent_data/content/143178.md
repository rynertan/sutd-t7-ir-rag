An apparatus 11 for purifying blood which is able to separate blood into plasma and blood rich in blood cells, to purify the separated plasma and to mix the purified plasma into the blood stream simultaneously by itself. The appa ratus 11 has two parts, i.e. a blood flowing system 12 16 in which the blood is separated by means of porous hollow fibers 14 provided in a container 11 and the purified plasma is mixed into the blood stream through the hollow fibers 14 , and a plasma flowing path 19, 24, 25, 20 in which the separated plasma is circulated and purified at a plasma purifying device 25 provided on the way of the path. The apparatus 11 has a simple structure and can be operated without any specific cares and difficulty. The appa ratus is free from any problems, for instance, hemolysis, fiber blockage, mixing of the purifier particles into blood, and the like.
