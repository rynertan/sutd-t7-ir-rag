# IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO SEGMENTED DISCHARGE TUBE DEVICES

## Abstract
A segmented discharge tube device is provided, particu larly for the discharge tube of a laser, in which a number of electrically isolated aluminium segments presenting a pas sage through which plasma may pass are located within an aluminium tube with heat conductive electrically insulating material in the form of anodisation between the outer sur faces of the segments and the adjacent inner surfaces of the tube.
