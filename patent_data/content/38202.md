# Polyurethane composition containing a dye.

## Abstract
A polyurethane composition comprises a polyurethane and at least one metal complex dye, vat dye, sulphur dye and or acid dye. The polyurethane is synthesized by the reac tion of a polymeric diol containing a polyoxyethylene chain as a minor proportion and having an average molecular weight in the range 300 to 5,000, from 2.2 to 5.0 moles of an alicyclic di isocyanate per mole of polymeric diol, an alicyclic diamine and hydrazine in proportion such that the molar ratio of hydrazine to hydrazine diamine is in the range 0.05 1 to 0.8 1. This polyurethane composition is only slightly susceptible to deteri oration by light and is suitable for use as a component of artifi cial leather or as a coating material for fabrics.
