# Apparatus for remote hydraulic control of a subsea well device.

## Abstract
Apparatus for the remote individual control of a plural ity of hydraulically actuated operators comprises first and second signal pressure lines A, B connected from a pressure source 37 to supply selected pressure signals to a plurality of AND gates G1 G25 each having its out put connected to a separate operator, and a pair of matrices V1 V5, V6 V10 of series connected valvepairs connected between the respective signal pressure lines and the re spective inputs of the AND gates to select the appropriate pressure signals, for the applicator to be energised and apply them to the two inputs of the AND gates associated with that applicator, each AND gate, when opened by said signals connecting the associated applicator to a source of pressure.
