# Method of controlling the power output of a nuclear reactor.

## Abstract
The power output of a nuclear reactor is controlled in response to a variable average reactor coolant temperature set point 79 . The set point 79 is dependent upon percent of full power load demand. A manually actuated 85 droop mode of control is provided whereby the reactor coolant temperature is allowed to drop below the set point 79 temperature a predetermined amount wherein the control is switched from reactor control rods exclusively to feedwater flow.
