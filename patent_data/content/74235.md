# Programmable signal analyzer.

## Abstract
A programmable multi channel signal analyzer capable of automatically evaluating and displaying various para meters of complex analog waveforms is disclosed. A non real time sampling technique which makes use of the repetitive nature of the input analog signal is utilized to achieve the desired high frequency digitizing of the analog signal. Subsequent data reduction, parameter evaluation and display of test results are achieved in conjunction with a microprocessor controlled subsystem. Communication with an external host system is effected by means of the IEEE 488 general purpose interface bus.
