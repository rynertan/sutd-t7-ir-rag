# A FILTER ARRANGEMENT

## Abstract
A filter arrangement in the form of a hose filter in which a support is inserted into the filter hose to hold the same outwardly tensioned and clamped securely to a perforated plate. The upper end of the support is of conical configuration, such that the intrinsic weight of the support will generate a gripping force between the filter hose and the hole. The filter hose 4a is provided at the upper part thereof with two collars 17,18 and the hole 15a is intended to co act with the filter hose between the collars. The support 5a thus presses the filter firmly against the sides of the holes 15a .
