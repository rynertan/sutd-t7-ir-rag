# Protective clothing.

## Abstract
This invention relates to garments for protecting the wearer from cold during aquatic sports such as windsurfing. For various reasons neither the conventional wet suit nor any conventional dry suit may be described totally satisfactory for windsurfing. It is essential to retain considerable freedom of arm movement and also to keep a stylish appearance, particularly for competitive work. To meet these conflicting requirements, there is provided a one piece garment in which leg portions 2 and a body portion 1 are of expanded rubber and close fitting, while the arm portions 3 are of loose fitting waterproof material giving freedom for the arms but providing less thermal insulation.
