Preferably, the compounds of the invention are isolated from cultures of Xenhorhabus using typical extraction techniques such as liquid chromatography and subsequent extraction by an organic or aqueous solvent. Suitable culture media for the antibiotic strains of Xenorhabdus included materials containing suitable carbon and energy sources such as glucose or other carbohydrates, glycerol, or lipids, suitable nitrogen sources such as ammonia, urea, amino acids, peptides or proteins, appropriate quantities of inorganic nutrients such as phosphate, potassium, magnesium, calcium and trace elements, and preferably a source of vitamins and growth factors, e.g. yeast extract. The continuous culture processes of the invention are preferably carried out between 23 C and 37 C, most preferably at about 28 C. They are preferably carried out at a pH of between 6.3 and 7.5, most preferably about 6.8. In continuous culture, fresh culture medium is preferably added to give a dilution rate of between 0.01 hr ¹ and 0.5 hr ¹, most preferably between 0.04 hr ¹ and 0.1 hr ¹. Notwithstanding other forms which may fall within the scope of the present invention, preferred forms will now be described with references to the following examples Xenorhabdus nematophilus strain All l ATCC 53200 can exist in two morphologically different forms known as primary 1 and secondary 2 as reported by R.J.Akhurst in The cells were harvested by centrifugation 9000 RPM, 0.25h and the supernatant was decanted. A sintered Pyrex funnel was uniformly packed with dry octadecyl silica 50 70um, 6cmx12.5cm and covered with filter paper. The solvent flow through the silica was induced by a vacuum 10 kPa and the eluate collected in a filter flask. The silica was washed with methanol 1L , water 4L and then the supernatant 5L was applied followed by water 2L and acetonitrile ammonium acetate 1 1 0.2M , pH4.5,2L . This latter fraction was evaporated in vacuo to yield a crude mixture of xenocoumacins 3 , 21g . A solution of this mixture 5g in water 20ml was chromatographed on Sephadex G10 84x5cm, 1650 ml in aqueous acetic acid 0.5 at a flow rate of 3.2ml min ¹. The eluate was monitored continuously at 254 nm and absorbances corresponding to xenocoumacin I and II occurred At 1150 1400ml and 1300 1600ml respectively. A total of 3.7g 20 of xenocoumacins was recovered as a brown solid. The following medium is found to be suitable for the culture of Xenorhabdus nematophilus ATCC 39497. Glycerol 20gL ¹ yeast extract 10gL ¹ NH₄ ₂SO₄, 20gL ¹ KH₂PO₄, 10gL ¹ MgSO₄.7H₂O, 2.5gL ¹ CaCl₂.2H₂O,O.29gL ¹ FeSO₄.7H₂O, 27.8mgL ¹ MnSo₄.H₂O, 8.45mgL ¹ ZnSO₄.7H₂O, 14.4mgL ¹ CoCl₂.6H₂O, 0.10mgL ¹ and CuSO₄.5H₂O, 0.19mgL ¹. The medium was innoculated and growth proceeded for 6 days. The supernatant 136L was applied to a column 150mm by 1m of Amberlite XAD 2 resin 17.1L at 500ml.min ¹. After washing the column with 20L of water, methanol was pumped onto the column at a rate of 500ml min and the eluent collected in 20L aliquots. 500ml of the first aqueous methanolic fraction was lyophilised, extracted with ethylacetate 3 x 200ml and then chromatographed on Sephadex G25 in water. The column 2.5cm x 76cm was washed thoroughly with water, and then eluted with aqueous acetic acid 10 V V . The eluent was lyophilised. Substantially pure xenocoumacin 1 was obtained by subjecting the acetic acid fraction to HPLC on a Whatman Partisil M9 10 50 ODS column with acetonitrile ammonium acetate 0.2M,pH4.5 30 70 as eluant. At 4ml min on a 254mm column the retention time was 19 minutes for xenocoumacin I. High yields of xenocoumacins 1 and 2 can be extracted from the supernatant of cultures of The raw xenocoumacins recovered by the process of Example 1 were subjected to preparative, isocratic phase HPLC on a Whatman Partisil 10 ODS column using 0.2M acetonitrile ammonium acetate pH 4.5 in the ratio 40 60 as the mobile phase delivered at 12ml min.

Ar is an aryl and A, R₂ and R₅ are as defined. As will be understood by those skilled in the art, the stereospecificity may be altered or controlled by altering the oxidant used, e.g. H₂O₂ SeO₂ will confer a different stereochemistry on the vicinal diol to OsO₄. R₁ and R₃ of formula I may be varied by known processes of alkylation and acylation as per the following reactions The antiulcerogenic activity of the xenocoumacins of the present invention was demonstrated by the following tests Male Wistar rats were dosed perorally p.o. dosed with varying amounts of xenocoumacin 1. The animals were then exposed to ulcer inducing stress conditions, killed and examined for ulcer induction. The results were compared to a control using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Significance is taken as p 0.05. Xenocoumacin 1 was shown to be 74 effective when a dosage of 25 mg kg.po was administered, but only 8 effective for a dosage of 10mg kg.po. Test 1 was repeated using xenocoumacin 2, which was found to be 70 effective for a dosage of 25 mg kg.po., 61 effective for a dosage of 10mg kg.po and 26 effective for a dosage of 5mg kg.po. The xenocoumacins of the present invention may be used in the treatment of bacterial or fungal infections or in the treatment or prophylaxis of inflammatory diseases or ulcers. The compounds or mixtures of them may be administered in standard pharmaceutical formulations, in admixture with known pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, adjuvants and diluents. Formulations of the invention may also contain other active substances. Xenocoumacins 1 and 2 can be used independently or in admixture as the active ingredient in the manufacture of the following pharmaceutical formulations The xenocoumacins of the invention may also be administered topically or intravenously. Preferred dosage rates are within the range of 0.1mg kg to 50mg kg when administered periorally, and 0.01 to 20 mg kg when administered intravenously. Topical formulations can contain up to approximately 10 active substance.
