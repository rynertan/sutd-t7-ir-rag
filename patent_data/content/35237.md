# A single mode transmission optical fiber and a method of manufacturing the same.

## Abstract
A single mode transmission optical fiber comprising a core of a radius a having an arbitrary not constant refractive index distribution n r in the radial direction r, the index distribution being expressed by n² r n₁² 1 2 Δ₀ f r , and a cladding having a con stant refractive index n₂, the radius a of the core being
