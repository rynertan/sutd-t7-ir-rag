# Marine loading arm monitoring system.

## Abstract
An apparatus for monitoring the spatial position of a refer ence point 31 relative to a predetermined origin 0 , the reference point being located on an articulated marine loading arm 10 having a plurality of pivotally interconnected fluid conduits 14, 23, 26 forming pivot angles at the interconnections of the conduits, including segments D5, D7, D8 subtended by the pivot angles and means 52, 53, 54 are provided for sensing lengths of the segments as the loading arm articulates. The sensing means generate electrical signals proportional to the segment lengths and a computer 65 receives the electrical signals and calculates the position of the reference point there from based on the known geometry of the loading arm.
