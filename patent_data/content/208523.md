# GLUTAMATE ANTAGONISTS

## Abstract
Venoms of New World spiders or the genera genera Argiope and Araneus e.g. Argiope trifasciata and Araneus gemma contain active components which have a significantly high level of specific action at glutamate receptors and can be isolated for use as a glutamate antagonist. Moreover, unlike the complex polypeptides referred to above, these com pounds are of relatively very low molecular weight less than 1000 and are accordingly very attractive for insecticidal use and in other applications in which glutamate antagonist ac tivity is desirable. The isolation purification and characteristics of two such active compounds is described.
