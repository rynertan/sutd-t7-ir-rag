# Homogeneous fluorescence immunoassay using a light absorbing material.

## Abstract
A method for separation free solid phase immunoassay of an analyte includes contacting an anti analyte attached to the surface of a solid support with the analyte, a light absorbing material and a fluorescent tracer for the analyte. The resulting mixture is incubated. The method includes applying excitation light to the mixture and time resolved measurement of fluores cence emission from the tracer. All excitation light and fluores cence emission are absorbed by the light absorbing material ex cept that absorbed and emitted by the tracer bound to the anti analyte whereby the only fluorescence emission detected is from the bound tracer. Since free tracer in the fluid phase of the assay medium does not emit fluorescence, separation of the bound and free fractions is unnecessary. The invention in cludes a kit of materials useful in performing an immunoassay in accordance with the method of the invention.
