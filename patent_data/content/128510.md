## Description
PROCESS FOR PRODUCING DIFLUOROMETHANE FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a process for producing difluoromethane and, more particularly, to a process for producing difluoromethane in high yield by reacting dichloromethane with hydrogen fluoride in a gaseous phase in the presence of a catalyst. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Many processes for producing fluorocarbons which comprise reacting aliphatic ha logena ted hydrocarbons with hydrogen fluoride HF have hitherto been proposed and are described, e.g., in U.S. Patent 3,632,834, European Patent Application OPI Nos. 56,548 and 36,123 and British Patents 1,369,870 and 1,201,588, etc. However, halogenated hydrocarbons employed in the foregoing reaction are limited to those having at least 2 carbon atoms, carbon tetrachloride CCQ4 or chloroform CHC3 of methane type compounds furthermore, there is scarcely any literature on a process for producing difluoromethane CH2F2 using dichloromethane CH2CQ2 and HF. In general, it is described in various reports that it is difficult to produce CH2F2 with high efficiency. It is described, for example1 in Chemistry and Industry of Fluorine Compounds, page 267, publishedDecember in 1977 by CMC Co., Ltd. that CC 3 group is highly reactive and substituted stepwise from CCQ2F to CCQF2 but it is difficult to fluorinate it to reach CF3 further, the CHC 2 group has poor reactivity and although it can be substituted to reach CHCRF, it is difficult to further substitute it to reach CHF2 furthermore, as hydrogen in the molecule increases, the reactivity becomes poor, and decomposition and side reactions are liable to occur. In fact, only a process involving a gaseous reaction of CH2Ct2 and HF using chromic trioxide as a catalyst Japanese Patent Publication No. 3004 67 is disclosed as the process for producing CH2F2. However, the process yields only 43 CH2F2 based on the raw material CH2CB2, and also results in serious loss of CH2CQ2, which is believed to be caused due to side reactions. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An object of the present invention is to provide a process for producing difluoromethane in which side reactions are extremely minimized and the desiredCH2F2 can be obtained in high yield. As a result of wide range of and detailed investigations on the process comprising the reaction of CH2C 2 and HF in a gaseous phase, the present inven tors have discovered that by performing the reaction under appropriate conditions using a specific catalyst, side reactions can be extremely minimized andCH2F2 can be obtained in high yield, and thus the present inventors have accomplished a process for producing CH2F2,that is extremely advantageous from an economical standpoint. Namely, the present invention is directed to a process for producing difluoromethane which comprises reacting CH2C with HF in a gaseous phase in the presence of at least one catalyst selected from i a catalyst consisting essentially of aluminum fluoride or a mixture of aluminum fluoride and chromium fluoride and ii a catalyst obtained by depositing 0.05 to 1 part by weight of ferric chloride on 1 part by weight of activated carbon carrier. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The catalyst i consisting essentially of aluminum fluoride or a mixture of aluminum fluoride and chromium fluoride may be carried on porous carriers such as activated carbon etc., or may also be mixed with porous carriers followed by molding. For example, in the case of using aluminum fluoride AQF3 alone or aluminum fluoride and chromium trifluoride CrF3 in combination, they may be employed after molding as they are, as a mixture with porous carriers followed by molding or by carrying them on porous carriers. In the case of using them after depositing on carriers, the proportion of aluminum fluoride or the mixture of aluminum fluoride and chromium fluoride is at least I wt , and preferably from 2 to 20 wtZ calculated as AQ or AQ Cr , based on the weight of the carriers.In the case of using them as a mixture with carriers, the proportion of aluminum fluoride or the mixture of aluminum fluoride and chromium fluoride is at least 1 wt , and preferably from 2 to 30 wtt calculated as AQ or AQ Cr , based on the weight of the carriers. The catalyst i can be obtained by subjecting an aluminum compound or a mixture of the aluminum compound and a chromium compound to fluorinating treatment. In this case, it is preferred that these compounds be subjected to fluorinating treatment after they are molded, after they are mixed with porous carriers followed by molding, or after they are deposited on carriers. Specific examples of chromium compounds include chromium oxide, chromium hydroxide, chromium chloride, chromium nitrate, etc., which are anhydrous or possess crystalline water chromic acid salts such as ammonium chromate, etc. Specific examples of aluminum compounds include oxides e.s. activated alumina , chlorides hydroxides, nitrates, etc., of aluminum that are anhydrous or possess crystalline water.Of thesechromium compounds and aluminum compounds, hydroxides , oxides and chlorides are preferably employed.CrF3 or ARF3 may also be partly incorporated into the aforesaid chromium compounds or aluminum compounds. In the case of using the chromium compounds and the aluminum compounds as the mixture, it is desired that the mixing ratio by weight of AQ in the aluminum compound to Cr in the chromium compound be in the range of 0.1 1 to 50 1, and preferably be from 0.3 1 to 20 1. When the ratio of AQ to Cr is overly large or small, side reactions are likely increased. As the method for the fluorinaiing treatment described above, fluorocarbons such as C2Ct3F3, CCQF3, etc., HF, or gases obtained by diluting the foregoing gases with inert gas such as N2, etc., can be employed.In the case that the fluorinating treatment is carried out at relatively high temperatures, it is preferred to use diluted gases. It is desired that the fluorinating treatment be performed at 150 to 5000C, and preferably at 200 to 4500C until the consumption of HF or fluorocarbons introduced is not substantially observed. The pressure is not particularly limited, but the treatment is generally conducted under normal atmospheric pressure. The fluorinating treatment of the aforesaid aluminum compounds or the mixtures of the aluminum compounds and the chromium compounds may also be effected during the production of difluoromethane by contacting them as such with a gaseous mixture of raw materials for difluoromethane i.e., CH2C 2 and HF . However, it is preferred that fluorinating treatment of the aluminum compounds or the mixtures of the aluminum compounds and the chromium compounds be carried out in advance since the reaction conditions for producing difluoromethane are not necessarily identical with the conditions for the fluorinating treatment. While the chemical composition of the catalyst obtained by the fluorinating treatment is not entirely clear, it is believed that the catalyst would be at least partly fluorinated ., and an excellent catalyst having high activity and extremely minimized side reactions can be obtained. In the case of using CrF3 and AQF3 as a catalyst, it is unnecessary to perform the fluorinating treatment, as a matter of course. The method for producing the catalyst ii comprising ferric chloride on an activated carbon carrier used in the process of the present invention is not particularly limited. For example, a determined amount of ferric chloride which is anhydrous or possesses crystalline water is dissolved in a solvent, e.g., a determined amount of water or an aqueous hydrochloric acid solution, etc., in which ferric chloride is easily soluble, to prepare a solution having a determined concentration. A determined amount of activated carbon which has been previously dried is immersed in the resulting solution and allowed to reach adsorption equilibrium. Thereafter the activated carbon is removed and dried in vacuum or with heating. Alternatively, activated carbon is immersed in the aforesaid ferric chloride solution and then the dispersion was evaporated to dryness.The above catalyst can be prepared in low costs and is economically excellent. Further when the proportion of ferric chloride to activated carbon is too small, the reaction does not proceed and the rate of conversion into CH2F2 becomes poor. It is thus preferred that the proportion of ferric chloride to be carried be large to a certain extent. The conversion rate increases as the proportion of ferric chloride increases. However, even though the quantity of ferric chloride carried increases, the conversion rate scarcely increases as the quantity of ferric chloride carried reaches to a certain level. It is preferred to choose ferric chloride generally in the range of from 0.05 to 1 part by weight, more preferably in the range of from 0.1 to 0.5 part by weight, per part by weight of activated carbon. The reaction temperature varies depending upon the proportion of HF and CH2CQ2, kind of catalyst, conditions such as contact time with catalyst, etc.However, when the temperature is too low, the reactivity becomes poor and the yield of CH2F2 becomes poor. Alternatively when the temperature is too high, there is a danger of causing problems such as deterioration of catalyst, corrosion of materials for constructing reactors, etc. In the case of using the catalyst i , it is preferred that the reaction temperature be in the range of 200 to 5000C, and more preferably 300 to 4500C.Further in the case of using the catalyst ii , it is preferred that the temperature be in the range of 200 to 3500C, and more preferably 250 to 3200C. Turning to the proportion of raw materials HF and CH2CQ2, the formation of CH2F2 decreases when the proportion of HF is low. When the proportion of HF increases, the yield of CH2F2 increases. Thus, increasing the proportion of HF is effective to some extent, but, over a certain level, the yield of CH2F2 does not markedly increase even though the proportion is raised. In addition, excess or unreactedHF should be discarded or recovered. Accordingly, the increased HF proportion results in complicated treatments and economical disadvantage. It is thus preferred that the molar ratio of HF to CH2CQ2 be in the range of from 1 1 to 20 1, and more preferably is from 2 1 to 10 1. It is necessary that the raw materials be gasified in advance using an evaporator, etc., since the reaction is a gaseous reaction. Further, the operation pressure is not particularly limited as long as it is within the range in which the raw materials and the product are not liquefied, but it is preferred from an economical viewpoint that the reaction be conducted under normal pressure or under slightly compressed pressure. The mode of contact of the catalyst with the raw materials is not particularly limited, but fluidized bed mode or fixed bed mode, etc., may be applied. For simplicity of apparatus, the fixed bed mode is preferred. As stated above, the process for producingCH2F2 in accordance with the present invention is an extremely excellent process from an industrial standpoint in which by products are hardly produced and CH2F2 is obtained in high yield. Hereafter the present invention will be described in more detail with reference with the following examples. EXAMPLE 1 In water was dissolved 300 g of AC3 6H2O, and 250 g of an aqueous 46 hydrofluoric acid solution commercially available was gradually added to the resulting solution to form aluminum trifluoride. Subsequently, by maintaining the system at about 700C under reduced pressure of about 50 mmHg, the by produced hydrochloric acid, excess hydrofluoric acid and most of water were removed by evaporation to obtain paste like aluminum fluoride. After molding it into a pellet of 6 mm x 6 mmH, the pellet was gradually heated in an N2 flow to dry. After maintaining at about 4000C for 3 hours, 100g of aluminum fluoride catalyst was obtained. This catalyst, 100 m , was placed in aHastelloy C made reactor having an inner diameter of 20 mm and a length of 1 m. While maintaining the inner temperature of the reactor at 4000C under normal pressure, 2.1 g hr of CH2Ct2 and 4.0 g hr of HF were supplied into the reactor in a gaseous phase by evaporating them in an evaporator. After the system was suffi ciently stabilized, the organic matter which remained after the removal of the unreacted HF and the formed HCl in the outlet gas of the reactor using an alkali was recovered for 5 hours by condensation and liquefaction. The composition of the recovered organic matter was analyzed by gas chromatography, and as a result, the following data was obtained. CH2F2 4.80 g, CH2CQF 0.85 g, CH2CQ2 1.26 g From the results, it is understood that theCH2F2 and CH2ClF were formed in yields of 75 ana 10 , respectively, based on CH2CQ2 supplied. CH2CQF and CH2CQ2 can be used as raw materials for CH2F2 by recovering them, so that the ultimate yield of CH2F2 based on CH2CQ2 becomes higher. EXAMPLE 2 In a Hastelloy C made reactor having an inner diameter of 20 mm and a length of 1 m was filled up 100 mQ of pellet like activated alumina of 6 mmf x 6 mmH. While maintaining the inner temperature of the reactor at 3500C usina a heater, N2 gas was fed at a flow rate of 30 mQ min to dry. Thereafter, N2 gas was discontinued and HF was slowly fed at 3500C. The feeding of HF alone was continued until the consumption of HF was not substantially observed. Then, the inner temperature of the reactor was raised to 3750C and 2.4 g hr of CH 2CZ2 and 3.9 g hr of HF were supplied into the reactor in a gaseous phase. After the system was sufficiently stabilized, the organic matter which remained after the removal of the unreacted HF and the formed HCl in the outlet gas of the reactor using an alkali was recovered for 5 hours by condensation and liquefaction.The composition of the recovered organic matter was analyzed by gas chromatography and as a result, the following data was obtained. CH2F2 5.2 g, CH2CQF 1.1 g, CH2CQ2 1.6 g The results indicate that CH2F2 and CH2ClF were formed in yields of 71 and 11 , respectively, based on the CH2Cl2 supplied. EXAMPLE 3 In the same reactor was filled up 100 mQ of the same activated alumina as used in Example 2. While maintaining the inner temperature of the reactor at 4000C using a heater, N2 gas was fed at a flow rate of 30 mnin to the dry activated alumina Subsequently, while maintaining the temperature of the reactor at about 3000C, the feeding of N2 gas was discontinued. Immediately thereafter, 2.4 g hr of CH2CQ2 and 3.9 g hr of HF were supplied into the reactor in a gaseous phase. As the raw material gases were fed, a sudden increase of the temperature was caused around the inlet of the reactor to exceed 4000C. The high temperature of the filled layer was successively shifted from the inlet to the central part of the layer. During the shifting, the acidic components in the outlet gas of the reactor were captured with an alkali and the organic matter was recovered by condensation and liquefaction. The acidic components captured and the organic matter were analyzed by titration and gas chromatography, respectively. As a result, most of CH2CQ2 supplied remained unreacted, and 70 of HF was consumed. Further, a part of the catalyst after supplying the aforesaid raw material gases was taken out and its X ray diffraction was examined. As a result, it was confirmed that the presence of AQF3 was established. This catalyst was reacted under the same conditions using the same apparatus as used in Example 2.As a result, CH2F2 and CH2CQF were formed in yields of 64 and 13 , respectively, based on the CH2CQ2 supplied. From the foregoing, it was confirmed that the fluorinating treatment of the catalyst was possible also by gases of CH2CQ2 and HF. EXAMPLE 4 20 g of aluminum chloride was dissolved in 100 g of water,and 100 g of activated carbon pellet of 4 mmf x 4 mmH which had been dried at 3000C in an N2 flow was added thereto and mixed therewith.Thereafter, the mixture was dried with an evaporator under reduced pressure to obtain the catalyst carried on activated carbon.. The catalyst was filled up in the same reactor as used in Example l. Subseuently, while flowing N2 gas at a flow rate of 30 m inii, drying was performed at 2000C for 2 hours and gaseous HF was fed through the reactor. The feeding of N2 gas was gradually discontinued, and, at the same time, the inner temperature was heated to 400 C. After the consumption of HF was not substantially observed, 2.1 g hr of CH2CQ2 and 4.0 g hr of HF were supplied into the reactor in a gaseous phase while evaporating them in an evaporator. After the system was sufficiently stabilized, the amount of the organic matter recovered in a manner similar to Example 1 was determined to obtain CH2F2 4.5 g, CH2CQF 0.93 g, CH2CQ2 1.4 g. The results indicate that CHF2 and CH2ClF were formed in yields of 70 and 11 , respectively, based on the Ch2 2 supplied. EXAMPLE 5 After thoroughly mixing 30 g of commercially available A F3 and 100 g of powdery activated carbon, the mixture was molded into a pellet of 6 mmf x 6 mmH. 100 mQ of this catalyst was placed in the same reactor as used in Example l, and the system was maintained at 4000C for 3 hours in an N2 flow. Subsequently, while maintaining the inner temperature of the reactor at 3900C, 2.10 g hr of CH2CQ2 and 4.0 g hr of HF were supplied into the reactor in a gaseous phase while evaporating them in an evaporator.After the system was sufficiently stabilized, the organic matter which remained after the removal of the unreacted HF and the formed HCl in the outlet gas of the reactor using an alkali was recovered for 5 hours by condensation and liquefaction. The composition of the recovered organic matter was analyzed by gas chromatography and as a result, the following data was obtained. CH2F2 4.6 g, CH2C F 1.0 g, CH2CQ2 1.40 g The results indicate that CH2F2 and CH2ClF were formed in yields of 72 and 12 , respectively, based on the CH2Cl2 supplied. EXAMPLE 6 360 g of AZ36H2O was dissolved in water and 250 g of HF was gradually added to the resulting solution to react them. Thereafter, the system was heated in anN2 flow, the moisture, formed HCQ and excess HF were evaporated off and removed to obtain A3. Commercially available CrF3 3H2O powder, 63 g, was thoroughly mixed with the whole amount of this ARF3 to obtain a mixture of CrF3 and A3. The mixture was molded into a pellet of 6 mmf x 6 mmH. Thereafter, the pellet was dried by heating at about 3500C for 3 hours in an N2 flow to obtain a pellet like mixture of AQF3 and CrF3 having a ratio of AQ weight Cr weight in the compound of 2 1. This catalyst, 100 mQ, was filled up in aHastelloy C made reactor having an inner diameter of 20 mm and a length of 1 m. While maintaining the inner temperature of the reactor at 3300C under normal pressure, 6.3 g hr of CH2CQ2 and 7.4 g hr of HF were supplied into the reactor in a gaseous phase by evaporating them in an evaporator. After the system was sufficiently stabilizedr the organic matter which remained after the removal of the unreacted HF and the formed HCl in the outlet gas of the reactor using an alkali was recovered for 5 hours by condensation and liquefaction. The composition of the recovered organic matter was analyzed by gas chromatography and as a result, the following data was obtained. CH2F2 12.7 g, CH2CQF 3.8 g, CH2CQ2 6.0 g The results indicate that CH2 F2 and CH2ClF were formed in yields of 66 and 15 , respectively, based onthe CH2C supplied, and by products were scarcely produced. EXAMPLE 7 In the same reactor as used in Example 6 there was placed 100 mQ of a pellet molded into 4 mmf x 4 mmH, composed of 40 wt of chromic trioxide chromia and 60 wt of aluminum trioxide alumina . Then, while flowing N2 gas at a flow rate of 30 mQ min, the inner temperature of the reactor was gradually raised using a heater, and drying was performed at 2000C. Thereafter HF gas was added thereto, the feeding of N2 gas was slowly discontinued, and, at the same time, the inner temperature was raised to 3500C.After the consumption of HF was not observed, the feeding of HF was discontinued to obtain the fluorinated catalyst having a weight ratio of AQ Cr of 1.2 1. Subsequently, while maintaining the inner temperature of the reactor at 3000C, 6.2 g hr of CH2CQ2 and 6.6 g hr of HF were supplied into the reactor in a gaseous phase by evaporating them in an evaporator. After the system was sufficiently stabilized, the organic matter which remained after the removal of the unreacted HF and the formed HCl in the oulet gas of the reactor sing an alkali was recovered for 5 hours by condensation and liquefaction. The composition of the recovered organic matter was analyzed by gas chromatography, and, as a result, the following data was obtained. CH2F2 11.9 g, CH2CtF 3.5 g, CH2CQ2 7.1 g The results indicate that CH F and CH ClF were 22 2 formed in yields of 63 and 14 , respectively, based on the CH2CQ2 supplied. EXAMPLE 8 26 g of CrCg3.6H2O and 45 g of ARCt3 6H2O were dissolved in water to prepare an aqueous solution.After 100 g of an activated carbon pellet 4 mmf x 4 mmH which had been dried at 3000C for 2 hours in an N2 flow was mixed with the aqueous solution, the mixture was dried in an evaporator in vacuum to deposit about 0.15 part by weight of CrCQ3 and 0.25 part by weight of AQCQ3 per 1 part by weight of activated carbon. 100 mt of the aforesaid activated carbon having deposited thereon AtCt3 and CrCQ3 was placed in a Hastelloy C made reactor having an inner diameter of 20 mm and a length of 1 m, and while feeding N2 gas at a flow rate of 30 mi min, the inner temperature of the reactor was slowly raised using a heater and dried at 2000C. Then, HF gas was added thereto, the flow of N2 gas was slowly discontinued, and the inner temperature was raised to 3500C. After consumption of HF passed through the reactor was not observed, the feeding of HF was discontinued, and thus a catalyst was obtained. Next, while maintaining the inner temperature of the reactor at 3000C, 7.6 g hr of CH2CQ2 and 7.1 g hr of HF were supplied into the reactor in a gaseous phase while evaporating them in an evaporator. After the system was sufficiently stabilized, the organic matter which remained after the removal of the unreacted HF and the formed HCl in the outlet gas of the reactor using an alkali was recovered for 5 hours by condensation and liquefaction. The composition of the recovered organic matter was analyzed by gas chromatography and as a result, the following data was obtained. CH2F2 14.1 g, CH2CQF 4.6 g, CH2CQ2 9.1 g The results indicate that CH2F2 and CH2ClF were formed in yields of 60.6 and 15.0 , respectively, based on the CH2C 12 supplied. Further, the total number of moles of theCH2F2 and CH2CQF formed and the unreacted CH2CQ2 exceeded 99 of the number of moles of the CH2CQ2 supplied, indicating that by products were scarcely produced. EXAMPLE 9 After thoroughly mixing 50 g of A F3 powders and 20 g of CrF3 3H2O powders, commercially available, and 100 g of powdery activated carbon , the mixture was molded into a pellet of about 6 mmf x 6 mmH, whereby a catalyst composed of A F3 and CrF3 in the proportion of about 0.4 part by weight of chromium per 1 part by weight of aluminum was obtained. 100 mQ of this catalyst was placed in aHastelloy C made reactor having an inner diameter of 20 mm and a length of 1 m, and was dried by heating at about 3500C for 2 hours in an N2 flow. The feeding of N2 was discontinued. Subsequently, while maintaining the inner temperature of the reactor at 300 C, 7.3 g hr of CH2C2 and 10.3 g hr ofHF were supplied into the reactor by evaporating them in an evaporator. After the system was sufficiently stabilized, the organic matter which remained after the removal of the unreacted HF and the formed HCl in the outlet gas of the reactor using an alkali was recovered for 5 hours by condensation and liquefaction. The composition of the recovered organic matter was analyzed by gas chromatography, and, as a result, the following data was obtained. CH2F2 14.6 g, CH2CQF 4.1 g, CH2CQ2 7.7 g The results indicate that CH2F2 and CH2ClF were formed in yields of 65 and 14 , respectively, based on the CH2Cl2 supplied. EXAMPLE 10 In about 200 g of water was dissolved 30 g of anhydrous ferric chloride to prepare an aqueous solution of ferric chloride. To the aqueous solution was added 100 g of activated carbon of a cylindrical shape having 4 mmf x 4 mmH, previously dried at about 3000C in an N2 flow. After stirring the mixture, water was evaporated off by heating to prepare a catalyst. This catalyst, 100 mQ, was filled up in a reactor having a diameter of 20 mm and further thoroughly dried by heating at about 3000C in an N2 flow. Then, while maintaining the inner temperature of the reactor at 3000C in an N2 flow under normal pressure, 2.46 g hr of CH2CQ2 and 5.22 g hr of HF were supplied into the reactor in a gaseous phase by evaporating them in an evaporator. After the system was sufficiently stabilized, the organic matter which remained after the removal of the unreacted HF and the formed HCl in the outlet gas of the reactor using an alkali was recovered for 5 hours by condensation and liquefaction. The composition of the recovered organic matter was analyzed by gas chromatography and as a result, the following data was obtained. CH2F2 5.73 g, CH 2C F 0.89 g, CH2CQ2 0.98 g The results indicate that CH2F2 and CHzClF were formed in yields of 76 and 9t, respectively, based on the CH2Cl2 supplied. Thus the CH2F2 was obtained in an extremely high yield and the production of the by products were extremely minimized. As is evident from the above examples, the process of the present invention is an excellent process for producing CH2F2 in which the formation yields ofCH2F2 is very high based on CH2C 2, undesired sidereaction is hardly noted and the by produced CH2CQF and unreacted CH2Ct2 can be recovered and used as raw materials for CH2F2 so that the yield becomes higher. While the invention has been described in detail and with reference to specific embodiments thereof, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that various changes and modifications can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope thereof.
