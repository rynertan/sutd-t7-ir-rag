# Positive displacement air compressors.

## Abstract
A rotary positive displacement air compressor includes a stator 2 containing a rotor 4 and having an inlet 8 and an outlet 10. The inlet includes two or more inlet apertures 60,62 in parallel associated with independently actuable pistons 64,76. Detecting means 50 detects the pressure of the compressed air and produces a signal when this pressure exceeds or is less than predetermined values and thus indicates whether the rate at which air is being compressed exceeds or is less than the compressed air demand to which the compressor is subjected. The two pistons 64,76 are associated with respective actuating means 90,88 which are controlled by the detecting means 50 for opening and closing each inlet aperture 60,62 independently to vary the rate of air flow through the inlet.
