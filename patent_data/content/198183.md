## Description
The present invention relates to an ultrasonic motor comprising a stator including a bending vibration plate, a longitudinal and torsional vibration coupling element having a beam extending slanted relative to the vibration axis of the bending vibration plate, a piezoelectric thickness vibration element connected with the longitudinal and torsional vibration coupling element through an elastic vibration element, a longitudinal vibration element combined with the longitudinal and torsional vibration coupling element, the elastic vibration element and the piezoelectric thickness vibration element, said beam of the stator generating elliptical vibration which is combination of longitudinal vibration generated in the piezoelectric thickness vibration elements and then boosted in the elastic vibration element and torsional vibration generated in the longitudinal and torsional vibration coupling element excited by the longitudinal vibration and therefore having the frequency of the vertical vibration, and a rotor which is contacted with the beam of the stator to receive the elliptical vibration to be rotated. A conventional ultrasonic motor of the type mentioned above is comprised of a vertical vibration element such as a bolt fastened vibrator which has been used in the ultrasonic industry. However in order to rotate a rotor, there is required to transform the vertical vibration into a rotational torque and therefore, many problems occur. In order to generate the rotational torque, ultrasonic elliptical vibration should be used. However, there has not been available an ultrasonic vibration element which is able to directly generate the elliptical vibration in the market. Thus, it can not be expected to manufacture an ultrasonic motor using ultrasonic elliptical vibration element. Piezoelectric motors using the elliptical vibration of the travelling elastic wave have a problem that the input and output efficiency is low. As a result of study of solving the problems mentioned above by the inventor, who developed an ultrasonic motor having a stator using the ultrasonic elliptical vibration element in a canti lever manner, but the developed motor has not shown a sufficient desirable results. The ultrasonic vibration element in the canti lever manner thus developed is shown in Fig. 8 a , in which a rotational torque can be obtained on a rotor pressed onto a free surface of the beam 1b by generation of the elliptical vibration 31 having one diameter in a direction perpendicular to the free surface of the beam 1b. The elliptical vibration can be generated by combining a torsional vibration 25 based on a bending vibration 26 of the bending vibration plate 1a integrally formed with the beam 1b and a vertical vibration having the same frequency of a vibration driving the bending vibration plate 1a. The reason why the bending vibration of the bending vibration plate 1a is transformed into the torsion 26 is based on such construction that the longitudinal direction of the bending vibration plate 1a is slanted relative to the center line X X of the bending vibration as shown in Fig. 8b. In order to generate the elliptical vibration on the free end surface of the elliptical vibration element in the form of canti lever manner, it is essential to arrange the beam 1b against the center line X X of the bending vibration of the bending vibration plate 1a. However, when such construction is adopted, the direction of the torsion acting on the beam 1b can not be perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the beam 1b, whereby there occurs a component displaced from the direction perpendicular to the longitudinal direction. In the ultrasonic motor using the vibration element mentioned above as the stator to which a rotor is rotatably depressed, the vectors of the rotational torque are shown at 28 and 28 in Fig. 8b. As understood, there occur vector components 29 and 29 in a radius direction of the rotor other than the vector components 27 and 27 of the tangent of the circumference of the rotor. The torque in the radius direction causes the depressing surface of the stator to rub the rotor surface in the radius direction. Apparently the rubbing motion mentioned above does not contribute to increase the rotational torque of the rotor but wears off the surfaces of the stator and the rotor. In order to provide the torsional vibration of the rotor, it is necessary to make the beam slanted relative to the center line of the bending vibration, however such slanted beam causes to provide the force in the radius direction. As mentioned above, the ultrasonic motor of the prior art has the drawback mentioned above. It is an object of the present invention is to provide an improved ultrasonic motor wherein the wear conditions of the contact surfaces of the stator and rotor of the ultrasonic motor using the vibration element of the canti lever type are improved by allowing displacement between the direction of the torque of the motor and tangent of the periphery of the rotor, so that the life of the motor can be increased. This object is solved with the features of claim 1. In order to decrease the area of the slidable surface of the stator having the displacement component in the radial direction, the end surface of the beam is adapted to be separable from the rotor surface in the inner area near the central axis of the vibration of the torsional movement of the stator and is adapted to be depressed with the outer peripheral portion of the rotor apart from the vibration center. The output obtainable in the inner area near the vibration center axis by the depression with the rotor is relatively low. To the contrary the outer part where the area of the slidable surface by the displacement component is relatively large as well as wearing tends to occur, the stator and rotor can act effectively to produce a high output, whereby the wearing due to the displacement component is relatively small. The present invention provides an ultrasonic motor of a high output with small amount of wearing of the stator by depressing the beam of the stator with the rotor in the outer area only. Referring to Fig. 1 to Fig. 6, reference numeral 1 is an ultrasonic longitudinal torsional vibration coupling element referred to as L T vibration coupling element or L T coupler for abbreviation of the canti lever type made of aluminium, 2 is a pair of piezoelectric thickness vibration elements having annular ring shape made of Pb Zr or Ti 0₃ of 35 mm outer diameter, 15 mm inner diameter and 2 mm thickness, 3 and 4 are respectively aluminium discs of 35 mm outer diameter, 8.2 mm inner diameter and 10 mm thickness, 5 is a bolt, 6 and 7 are terminal plates made of copper, 8 and 9 are lead wires, 10 is a steel rotor, 11 is a motor case, 16 is a bolt, 17 is a coil spring, 18 is a collar, 19 is a bearing, and 20 is a shaft having a connecting portion 20a screwed and inserted into the cylindrical part 10b of the rotor 10. The longitudinal vibration means the vibration in a cylindrical axis of the coupling element 1 and the torsional vibration means the vibration in the directions shown in the arrow marks 21 or 22 in Figs. 5 and 6. First of all, explanation is made about the canti lever type L T coupling element 1 which acts to generate the rotation torque of the ultrasonic motor. Referring to Fig. 4, the L T vibration coupling element 1 is made of metallic block having a disc 1a of outer diameter 35 mm and 9 mm height and a beam 1b of square shape projected from one of the surface of the disc 1a with 7 mm thickness, 35 mm width and 10 mm length. As shown in the drawings, the beam 1b is formed over the diameter of the disc passing the center of the disc 1a. At the other surface of the disc 1a there is formed a slot 1c across the disc 1a leaving a pair of projections 1d on both peripheral edge portions of the disc 1a. Each of the projections 1d has a flat surface 1e which serves as a member for supporting the canti lever type L T vibration coupling element 1. The beam 1b is slanted relative to the slot 1c with an angle Q of 26 . The piezoelectric thickness vibration elements 2 are put between the aluminium discs 3 and 4 acting as the elastic vibrating members of low ultrasonic loss and the screw 5 is penetrated through the piezoelectric thickness vibration elements 2 and aluminium discs 3 and 4 and is screwed into the threaded hole if defined at the central portion of the disc 1a with a torque wrench not shown of 150 kg f cm so as to clamp the respective elements 1, 2, 3, and 4, having one of the surface of the aluminium disc 3 contact with the flat surface of the projections 1d, then a resonator 100 can be formed. In this arrangement shown in Fig. 4, when the ultrasonic vibration driven element 2 is excited upon application of a high frequency voltage to the terminal plates 6 and 7, the vibration occurring at the element 2 is boosted by the aluminium discs 3 and 4 to generate a large amplitude vibration. Thus the disc 1a can be bent as shown at 1a by the force of the vibration of the piezoelectric thickness vibration elements 2 whereby the square plate 1b is deformed in the form of a share deformation as shown in 1b with one end of the plate 1b secured at the disc 1a and other end to be moved as free end so that a torsional vibration occurs in the plate 1b, thus resulting in the elliptical vibration which is a combination of the longitudinal vibration mode and torsional vibration mode. In this case the longitudinal vibration requires a large amplitude sufficient to bend the disc 1a of the L T vibration coupling element 1, therefore, there must be interposed an elastic vibration element made of an elastic material of low ultra sonic loss such as aluminium for boosting the vibration produced in the piezoelectric thickness vibration elements 2 between the disc 1a of the L T vibration coupling element 1 and the piezoelectric thickness vibration elements 2. In the preferred embodiment, the elastic vibration elements 3 and 4 are disposed above and below the piezoelectric thickness vibration elements 2, thereby obtaining a large vertical vibration. When a rotor is depressed onto the free end of the beam 1b which vibrates with the torsional elliptical vibration mode, the rotor can be rotated by the torque transferred from the beam thus a rotational motor can be obtained. In order to depress the rotor 10 onto the L T vibration coupling element 1, the bolt 16 is inserted through the coil spring 17, the collar 18 and the bearing 19 and the end portion of the bolt 16 is screwed into the screw hole if so that the rotor 10 is depressed onto the free end of the L T vibration coupling element 1 by about 10 kgf cm² force of the spring 17 compressed between the screw head of the bolt 16 and the collar 18. The outer race of the bearing 19 is strictly fitted in the receiving hole of the rotor 10 and the bolt 16 is slidably passed through the inner race of the bearing 19, thus the rotor 10 can be rotatably supported on the bolt 16 by the bearing 19 applying the resilient force of the spring 17 to the rotor 10. The rotor 10 has an annular member 10a comprising the contact surface projecting in the direction of a cylindrical axis of the rotor 10 toward the beam 1b with the end surface of the annular member 10a made flat so that the end surface can contact with the end surface of the beam 1b which is oscillated in the torsional elliptical vibration, thereby producing rotational torque on the rotor 10. Looking at the vibration mode at the end surface of the L T vibration coupling element 1, the end surface of the L T vibration coupling element 1 can be repeatedly projected or concaved making the screw hole 1f as the center of the vibration. When the end surface of the beam 1b is projected, the spring is compressed and the depressing force of the beam 1b to the annular member 10a of the rotor is made maximum and when the end surface of the beam 1b is concaved, the depressing force of the beam 1b to the annular member 10a is made minimum. Since the end surface of the beam 1b is made projected when the piezoelectric thickness vibration element 2 is shrunk and is made concaved when the piezoelectric thickness vibration element 2 is expanded, therefore, when the depressing force of the beam 1b to the rotor 10 is maximum, the beam 1b is concaved and when the depressing force of the beam 1b to the rotor 10 is minimum, the beam 1b is projected, whereby, from the view point of the phase, the timing when the rotor 10 receive the maximum torque and the timing when the depressing force is maximum is in phase and the rotor 10 rotates in the directions of arrow marks 21 in Fig. 5 and 22 in Fig. 6. The rotor 10 is provided with the annular member 10a of 2.5 mm width at the outer peripheral edge portion of the rotor 10 for being depressed by the beam 1b. Thus, there is formed a round recess 10c sink from the annular member 10a by 1mm depth. Accordingly, when the rotor 10 is mounted on the L T vibration coupling element 1, the rotor 10 depresses the flat surface of the beam 1b, so that a strong rotational torque can be transferred to the rotor 10 decreasing the entire amount of the contact area with the beam 1b, thereby suppressing the friction between the rotor 10 and the beam 1b. The effect mentioned above can be obtained when the inner diameter of the annular member 10a is made greater than about one half of the length of the beam 1b, preferably in the range of 4 7 to 6 7 of the length of the beam 1b. As the way of depressing the rotor 10 to the beam 1b, when the depressing means for depressing the rotor is located at the central portion of the beam 1b, the rotational torque can coincide with the phase at which the maximum torque occurs, then an effective impedance of the motor can be decreased, therefore the arrangement mentioned above is suitable to provide a high efficiency piezoelectric motor with a great torque and low input voltage. However, the present invention is not limited to the arrangement described above, for example, as shown in Fig. 7, it may be possible to dispose a spring 15 between the bottom of the motor case 11 and the bottom of the aluminium disc 4 so as to generate the depressing force for depressing the rotor 10 onto the free end of the beam 1b by means of the coil spring 15 which is compressed by a pressure control screw 14 making the motor case 11 as the fulcrum. Reference numerals 12 and 13 show the output shaft of the rotor 10 and the bearing. In the motor shown in Fig. 7, it is necessary to use the piezoelectric thickness vibration elements for rotating the motor. For this purpose, it is necessary to apply a high frequency voltage higher than 20 KHz to the piezoelectric thickness vibration elements 2. By selecting the frequency of the applying voltage, the motor can be rotated in the clockwise direction or counter clockwise direction. Normally 20KHz to 50 KHz frequency is preferably used. The revolution speed of the motor can be changed by selecting the voltage of the high frequency power source. For example, in the motor using the stator having 35 mm outer diameter and 45 mm height and the rotor of 35 mm outer diameter and 5 mm thick, the motor begins to rotate in the counter clockwise direction upon application of 10 volt sine wave voltage of 40. 85 KHz to the piezoelectric thickness vibration elements 2 and the motor rotate 60 to 100 r p m upon application of 30 volt sine wave, 100 to 150 r p m for 50 volt, 150 to 250 r p m for 70 volt, 200 r p m for 100 volt and 400 r p m for 100 volt. When the frequency of the applied voltage is changed, the rotation speed is lowered and the rotor is rotor is reversed at 39.64 KHz with a high torque. The way of rotation of the rotor is the same in both directions. In the embodiment mentioned above, the beam 1b is formed by an elongated rectangular plate shape, and the rotor surface to which the beam 1b contacts is made by the annular ring member, these portions may be made of various shapes. Various modifications of the beam 1b and the contacting surface 10a of the rotor are described in Figs 8 to 11. In the modifications the basic arrangement of the L T vibration coupling element 1 is the same used in the embodiment described above. The difference of the modifications from the embodiment mentioned above is in that a concave 1e is defined in the center portion of the beam 1b of the L T vibration coupling element 1 and the beam 1b is divided into two parts. The piezoelectric elliptical vibration elements of the L T vibration coupling element 1 is used as a stator and the rotor having a conical roller 10a comprising the contact surface is depressed thereto, the motor shown in Fig. 9 can be formed. A conical rotor 10d which is contactable to said concave 1e is covered with an elastic sheet 32 and an output shaft 20 inserted in the disc 10b is passed through the roller 10a to form the rotor and the output shaft 20 of the rotor is penetrated through a center hole of a cap bolt 5 then fastened by a nut 33 engaged with the ball bearing 19, then the conical roller 7 is pressedly secured to the stator. The conical roller 7 is made of wear resistance materials such as hardened copper. Upon application of a sine wave voltage of 36 KHz to the piezoelectric thickness vibration elements 2 through the lead wires 8 and 9, the leg 1d of an arcuate shape disposed on both sides of the slot 1c can be vibrated due to the vertical vibration occurred in the piezoelectric thickness vibration elements 2, the bending vibration element 1a supported by the cap bolt 5 at the center thereof is vibrated in a folded manner. As a result of the vibration, there occurs a torsional vibration on the beam 1b disposed slanted against the slot 1c and a strong torque occurs on the conical roller 10a secured onto the divided surface of the beam 1b and the output shaft 20 was rotated about 80 r p m. The rotation in the motor is smooth since the conical roller 10a is used compared to the conventional ultrasonic motor using a disc roller which is depressed to the stator end surface. The elastic sheet 32 can serve to absorb the vibration applied to the conical roller 10a and to transfer the driving force occurring in the conical roller 10a to the output shaft 10 through the disc 10b. The elastic sheet 32 is made of a silicon rubber sheet having a suitable friction coefficient. Referring to Fig. 10 showing the third example of the ultrasonic motor according to the present invention, in which the like parts are shown by the like number shown in the various embodiments shown in Figs. 1 to 9. The L T vibration coupling element 1 has its beam 1b defined a concave 1e of a semi spherical shape and the beam 1b is contacted by a roller 10a of a semi spherical shape complimentary to the concave 1e. The radius of the semi spherical shape of the concave 1e of the beam 1b is slightly greater than the radius of the roller 10a. Therefore, since the contact between the sliding surfaces of the roller 10a and the surface of the concave 1e is limited to the maximum diameter portion of the roller 10b, the frictional engagement of the roller 10a with the concave 1e can be prevented even if the depression force of the roller 10a to the concave 1e is made large and the amplitude of the vibration is made large. Referring to Fig. 11, showing the fourth example of the ultrasonic motor according to the present invention, in which the beam 1b of the L T vibration coupling element 1 has a projected member 1g of a frusto conical shape both end surfaces of which are cut perpendicular to the cone axis. The roller 10a has a generally cylindrical shape with the bottom half thereof recessed in a frusto conical shape to receive the projected member 1g so that the roller 10a can detachably fit and contact with the projected member 1g. In the example shown in Fig. 11, the vibration component which does not contribute the rotation of the roller 10a in the torsional vibration acting onto the beam 1b of the L T vibration coupling element 1 acts as the depressing force between the stator and rotor, wear of both members can be decreased. In the ultrasonic motor of the example 1, the the ultrasonic vibration is transferred to the output shaft 20 but is attenuated some amount. To solve the problem, the motor may be formed as shown in Fig. 12. Referring to Fig. 12, the rotor 10 may be divided into a sliding ring 10a comprising the contact surface and rotation shaft 10b and a elastic ring 33 is inserted between the sliding ring 10a and the rotation shaft 10b. The fastening force of the bolt 16 which is slidably fitted in the rotation shaft 10b is transferred to the sliding ring 10a and the ultrasonic vibration of the sliding ring 10a is absorbed by the elastic ring 33. By this arrangement, the elastic ring 33 transfers the force form the sliding ring 10a to the load and the depressing force is transferred to the sliding surface of the ring 10a absorbing the ultrasonic vibration. Moreover, the rotor receives the vertical vibration from the stator, and then the vertical vibration is excited by the counter act of the depression force, the rotor contacts the stator end surface at the reversed phase of the the stator elliptical motion, the bearing is disposed between the rotor and the stator end, the rotor is strongly vibrated at the time when the stator is in the reversed phase, the vibration can be prevented by a thrust bearing, preventing the rotor from entering close the stator so that wearing due to depression of the rotor against the stator surface at the time of the reversed phase can be decreased. Namely in the example 6, as shown in Fig. 13, a thrust bearing 34 is received in the central portion of the rotor 10b, a bolt to which a coil spring 17 is mounted is fastened to the end surface 1b of the L T vibration coupling element 1 through the bearing 19 for preventing the neck portion of the rotor 10b from being out of rotation center and a thrust bearing 35, the sliding surface 10a of the rotor 10 is depressed onto the end surface of the beam 1b of the L T vibration coupling element 1. In the ultrasonic motor as arranged in the manner mentioned above, undesired contact can be prevented by the thrust bearing 34, occurrence of the frictional noise between the rotor and stator at the time of reversed phase of the elliptical vibration resulting in preventing wearing of the rotor and the stator. The ultrasonic motor mentioned in the various examples can be applied to cutting machines and grinding machine. Referring to Fig. 14, a drilling machine using the ultrasonic motor is shown in which a work 41 fixed on a dies mechanism 40 is drilled a standard 43 vertically standing on a base 42 and the ultrasonic motor is vertically slidably supported on the standard 43 through the arm 44 slidably mounted on the standard 43. A collet chuck 46 is mounted on the output shaft of the ultrasonic motor 45 so as to mount a grinder 47 or drill needle on the collet chuck 46 as grinding tool or drilling tool. When a power switch 48 is turned on, a high frequency power supply accommodated in the standard is excited and the output shaft of the ultrasonic motor rotates 600 r.p.m. Accordingly, the grinder 47 is rotated. Releasing a faster 49 then the ultrasonic motor is moved in the downward direction upon pressing a lever 50 downward and the grinder 47 approaches the work 41. Seeing that the tip of the grinder 47 comes to the punch hole the operator pushed down the lever 50 downward, the grinder 47 contacts the work and the grinding is started. As the characteristic of the ultrasonic motor, when the load becomes heavy, the rotation speed of the motor is lowered, so that the the lever 50 must be depressed strong downward during grinding and at the time of finish of the work, the lever is pushed with a decreased force. In case the work is metal and a hole to be opened is deep, by exchanging the grinder with the drill, a desired hole can be cut by the machine shown in Fig. 14 in the same manner as a drilling machine. The disadvantages of the machine are in that the working speed rapid and super hard material such as super steel and ceramics can easily be cut.
