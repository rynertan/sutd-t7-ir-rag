# Method and apparatus for forming glass sheets.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus capable of accurately forming a heated glass sheet to a deep, abrupt, or complex curvature are disclosed as utilizing a first curved mold 42 that initially forms the glass sheet at a first forming station 20 preferably by the operation of gravity. The initially formed glass sheet is moved horizontally preferably by movement on the first curved mold 42 to a second forming station 22 . A second curved mold 48 of the second forming station 22 engages the initially formed glass sheet to provide accurate forming preferably by downward movement of the second curved mold that provides the engagement thereof with the glass sheet. In the preferred construction disclosed, the heated glass sheet is transferred from a furnace conveyor 28 to a topside conveyor 32 for depositing onto the first curved mold 42 , and a transfer conveyor 55 transfers the formed glass sheet from the second curved mold 48 to a quench station 24 for tempering.
