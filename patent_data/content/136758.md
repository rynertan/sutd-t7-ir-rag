# Circuit for generating a control signal for the field deflection in a picture display device.

## Abstract
The circuit comprises a field identification circuit with the aid of which a distinction can be made between the two fields which form an interlaced picture, and a signal selection circuit 11 16 for setting the sequence of occurrence of a first field signal which corresponds to a field, and a second field signal which corresponds to the subsequent field. The circuit enables a choice between a picture with or without interlace, it further being optionally possible to eliminate the interlace by shifting a field upwards or downwards relative to the other field.
