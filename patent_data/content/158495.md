# SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR REAL TIME DATA COLLECTION SURVEYING AND PROCESSING

## Abstract
A real time geophysical survey system comprises a base station 12 , one or more data acquisition vehicles 16, 18 , and one or more fixed reference stations 14, 15 . During a survey, by periodically polling a positioning transponder on each vehicle, a positioning system of the base station tracks the position of each vehicle with respect to both the base station and the fixed reference stations. Data regarding each vehicle s position are then provided to the base station computer, and the base station transmits signals to a positioning display aboard each vehicle so as to guide the vehicle along a preselected survey pattern. As the survey progresses, data representing geophysical measurements taken by instrumentation carried by each vehicle are periodically transmitted to the base station computer. Such data are then correlated in real time with the position of the vehicle and with data collected at the base site, and then output for evaluation by the base station computer.
