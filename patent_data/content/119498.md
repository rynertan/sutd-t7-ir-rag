## Claims
CLAIMS 1. A heavy duty grinding wheel in which abrasive grits are bonded in a resin matrix, characterized in that the abrasive grits are a 3 1 to 1 3 by volume mix of spherical sintered bauxite abrasive particles having a Krumbein No. of at least 0.8 and non spherical abrasive particles having aKrumbein No. of 0.4 or less. 2. A grinding wheel according to claim 1, in which the non spherical particles are fused alumina zirconia. 3. A grinding wheel according to claim 1, in which the non spherical particles are rod shaped sintered bauxite particles having a length to diameter ratio average greater than 1.4 to 1.

## Description
This invention relates to heavy duty snagging wheels for the conditioning of steel billets and slabs, particularly stainless steel. Heavy duty snagging wheels for stainless steel grinding were made more efficient by the introduction, in about 1960, of sintered bauxite abrasive grits as a substitute for fused alumina grits. Such abrasive grits are described in U.S. Patent 3,079,243. One product described by said patent has a blocky equidimensional shape. U.S. Patent 3,387,957 describes cylindrical sintered bauxite abrasive grits, made by extrusion of the raw material before firing, having a preferred length to diameter ratio of 1.5 to 1 and greater. U.S. Patent 3,183,071 discloses the use of high alumina mixes, other than bauxite, to produce similar rod shaped high alumina sintered abrasive products. Patent 1,592,088 of the Federal Republic ofGermany discloses the production of spherical sintered bauxite or other high alumina material abrasive grits for use in snagging wheels. That patent also states that sintered abrasive grits which are crushed and sieved can be mixed with fused alumina in making resin bonded snagging wheels. The patent further teaches that the extruded or spagetti or rod grits are superior to the crushed equidimensional grits. Because the rod grains are asserted to produce a rough finish, the patent suggests that the problem can be solved by the use of spherical sintered grains made from bauxite or other alumina mix as an improvement over the rod type grains. U.S. Patent 3,890,072 teaches a method for forming sintered alumous spheres e.g. sintered bauxite of high sphericity and strength for use as a snagging abrasive or as a well proppant. The present invention resides in the discovery that certain advantages in cost or performance can be achieved in grinding wheels for steel snagging by incorporating a blend of abrasive grits or two specifically different shapes, one of which is spherical. The spherical grits are formed of sintered alumous material. Such materials have recently been produced in large volumes for use in well propping. The non spherical grits may be extruded sintered rod type aluminous abrasive such as described in U.S.Patent 3,387,957 mentioned above, or in U.S. Patents 3,183,071 or 3,481,723. The length to diameter ratios of such grits may vary from 1.4 to 1 to as high as3 to 1. Depending upon the quality and cost of the abrasives employed and the particular snagging application, the ratio of the spherical to the non rical grit may range from 3 1 to 1 3. It is Applicant s theory that, in the case of spherical grits of a composition which otherwise would provide inferior grinding quality, that the interlocking of the abrasive particles of differing shape can permit substitution of up to 75 of the lower quality abrasive for the higher quality, more expensive abrasive, without significantly affecting grinding performance. Where the abrasives are of substantially equal inherent quality, the mixed shapes are believed to enhance grinding performance in at least some snagging applications. The spherical abrasives useful in the present invention have a Krumbein roundness of 0.8 or higher.The rod shaped grits as noted above, have an average length to diameter ratio of 1.4 to 1, and higher. Instead of the sintered rod shaped abrasive grits in admixture with the sintered aluminous grits, we may employ co fused alumina zirconia grits having 10 to 60 zirconia, preferably 20 to 30 zirconia such as described in U.S. Patent 3,181,939 and having a blocky shape such that the Krumbein number is 0.4 or less. The Krumbein number, as a designation for sphericity, is commonly used to describe the shape of proppant media used in the oil and gas well drilling industry and is described in Measurement and GeologicalSignificance of Shape and Roundness of Sedimentary Particles by W. C. Krumbein in the Journal of Sedimentry Petrology,Volume 11, pages 64 to 72, of 1941. Wheels containing 50 50 by volume blends of rod type abrasive and sintered bauxite spheres, in field tests in actual snagging of stainless steel in production mills, performed at least substantially equivalently in material removal rate and metal removal per wheel as abrasive wheels containing the more expensive standard rod type sintered abrasive, although in house laboratory tests showed poorer results in some cases. Similar results were obtained with a blend of 50 of blocky fused alumina zirconia 75 zirconia , with 25 spherical, and 25 rod type. Any of the known and conventional thermosetting resin bond systems can be employed to produce the wheels employing the mixed abrasivevsrains combination of the invention.
