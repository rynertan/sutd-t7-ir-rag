# Preparation of organometallic indium and gallium compounds.

## Abstract
A method of producing an adduct of an organometallic compound M R¹ ₃ where M is either indium or gallium and R¹ ₃ represents a plurality of organic radicals which may be the same or different, preferably methyl or ethyl groups, comprising electrolysing, using a sacrificial anode of the metal M, a solution containing components 1 and 2 as follows component 1 one or more organomagnesium halide compounds R¹MgX where X is a halide radical selected from Cl, Br and I where R¹ represents one of the groups contained in R¹ ₃ component 2 a polar aprotic liquid which is a solvent for component 1, eg tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether, di isopentyl ether, di n butyl ether, diphenyl ether or anisole. Preferably, the solution electrolysed additionally con tains a third component, component 3, which is one or more organic halides R¹X
