# A method of cooling a mould.

## Abstract
A method of cooling a mold in a glassware forming machine wherein an intermediate support 26 supports a mould portion 10 and defines a space 36 which serves to insulate a movable support 14 of mould opening and closing mechanism of the machine from the mould portion 10 . The mould portion 10 is cooled by blowing air into the space 36 . The air blown into the space 36 increases the insulating effect of the space 36 and also can be blown through an aperture 40 in the intermediate support 26 on to the mould portion 10 so as to cool that portion of the mould portion 10 .
