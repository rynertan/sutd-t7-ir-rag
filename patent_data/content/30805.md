# Process for the separation of contaminant material from contaminated oil.

## Abstract
The invention provides a process for the separation of contaminant material from contaminated oil comprising reacting the oil with an aqueous alkaline solution, such as an aqueous solution of sodium metasilicate, and separating the aqueous phase thereby formed from the oil phase. Oil, used as a lubricant and coolant in an industrial process, may become contaminated by foreign materials for example, water and solid particulate. Because of its cost, continued use of the oil is desirable but impossible if the foreign mater ials are not removed when the concentration of such becomes excessive. The process of the invention enables contaminants to be separated from such oil which can then be reused.
