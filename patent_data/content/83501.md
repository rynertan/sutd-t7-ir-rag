# Variable speed belt driven transmission system and method.

## Abstract
A variable speed belt drive transmission system with a driven pulley having a movable pulley half operated to move axially with generated axial forces that decrease from where the driven pulley is closed to where the driven pulley is open, the maximum generated force being from about 100 to about 120 percent of a required pulley axial force where theoretical belt slip could occur. A method for enhancing belt life by controlling belt tension with driven pulley axial force by establishing a required driven pulley axial force that decreases from where the driven pulley is closed to where the driven pulley is open, the generated force lines being from about 100 to about 120 percent of a determined pulley axial force line where theoretical belt slip impends. An actuator for a pulley where a plurality of circumja cent links are arranged in squirrel cage, treadmill fashion where one end portion of the links are attached to a mov able pulley half and the other end portion of the links are attached to a shaft common to the movable pulley half.
