# DIPLEXER USEFUL ESPECIALLY FOR TELEVISION TUNING SYSTEMS

## Abstract
A diplexer for electrical signals comprises a first frequen cy selective filter 22 coupled between a first input terminal 20A , and a circuit point 24 , a second frequency selective filter 26 coupled between the circuit point 24 and an output terminal 20C , and third frequency selective filter 28 coupled between a second input terminal 20B and the circuit point 24 . The first filter 22 selects frequencies higher than a first frequency and the second filter 26 selects frequencies lower than a second frequency which is higher than the first frequency, The third filter 28 selects frequen cies lower than a third frequency which is lower than the first frequency. In a television receiver, the first and second filters 22,26 serve as a bandpass filter for the UHF band, and the third filter 28 passes the VHF and CATV cable television bands.
