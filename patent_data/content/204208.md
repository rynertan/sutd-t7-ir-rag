# NESTING LID FOR LARGE LID CONTAINER

## Abstract
A nesting and stacking container box which will permit the nesting of container lids for large lidded containers. A hinging arrangement is provided so the lids can move from a closed position to a lateral hanging position with a stop mem ber being provided so that the movement of the hinge arms which are freely and rotatably mounted in the containers and lids is stopped at a position when the lids are in an open and nesting position. In this position the lids are angled outwardly from the containers. In one embodiment the lid members will continue to move in a manner such that the innermost por tions of the lids when resting in a closed position on the containers will move outwardly and away from the contain ers. In another embodiment, a catch arrangement is provided between the lid and an upper wall portion of its container to afford a stationary positioning of the lid for nesting purposes.
