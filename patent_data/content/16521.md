# Process for producing a silicon epitaxial layer.

## Abstract
Epitaxial layers are formed by introducing a reaction gas mixture into a reaction vessel in which semiconductor sub strates are located, whereas the pressure in said reaction vessel is maintained at not higher than 1333 Pa 10 Torr , and heating said semiconductor substrates by high frequency induction power so that layers grow epitaxially on said semi conductor substrates. The frequency f of high frequency power is maintained not higher than 50 kHz, and the pressure P in said reaction vessel is maintained as described in the following formula
