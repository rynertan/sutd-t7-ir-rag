# Full duplex communication system for voice grade channels.

## Abstract
A pair of full duplex modems 12, 14 , each at one end of a two wire voice grade telephone channel 16 , simul taneously transmit synchronous data at high speeds in both directions. In each modem, the simultaneous transmission and reception are accomplished by frequency division. The high speed operation is obtained by odd even bit stream division and full response binary to ternary level coding coupled with nine level quadrature amplitude modulation and correction framing techniques.
