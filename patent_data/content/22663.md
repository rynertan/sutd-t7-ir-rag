# PWM inverter device.

## Abstract
An inverter device operating under pulse width modulation PWM principle in which chopping pulse is formed by crossing points of a triangle waveform and a function waveform in order that pulse width of the inverter input current decreases towards later half of pulse train in each period of pulse repetition series.
