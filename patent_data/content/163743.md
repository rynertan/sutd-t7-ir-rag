# MONOCHROMATOR.

## Abstract
A monochromator disperses multi wavelength light emitted from a light source, isolating only a desired wavelength component. According to the present invention, in place of a concave grating which has heretofore been requisite for a monochromator for a wavelength range from the soft X ray region to the vacuum ultraviolet ray region, a plane grating C is employed which is highly accurate and is easily manufactured. An extremely simple wavelength scanning mechanism is employed in which the distance between an input slit A and the grating C and the distance between an output slit B and the grating C are constant. Thus, it becomes possible to realize a monochromator which is able to isolate light of a single wavelength with extremely high precision.
