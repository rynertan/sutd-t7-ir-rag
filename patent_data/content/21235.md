## Description
PREPARATION OF 25 HYDROXYCHOLESTEROL BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention This invention relates to the preparation of 25 hydroxycholesterol from 3 4 hydroxy 5 cholenic acid, hereinafter referred to as cholenic acid. The compound 25 hydroxycholesterol is subsequently converted to 25 hydroxycholecalciferol 25 OH D3 by conventional means. 2. Description of the Prior Art The compound 25 hydroxycholecalciferol is characterized by vitamin D activity. It has been isolated from plasma of hogs which have been maintained on high daily levels of vitamin D3 for extended periods as described in U.S. Patent No. 3,565,924 DeLuca et al February 23, 1971. Synthetic routes have been developed as well. See, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 3,772,361 DeLuca et al November 13, 1973 where 25 OH D3 is prepared from cholest 5,7 diene 3, 25 diol, in turn prepared from 3,25 cholesteryl diacetate U.S. Patent No. 3,833,622 Babcock et al September 3, 1974 where 3 hydroxychol 5 en 24 oic acid is converted after protection of the 3 hydroxy group to its acid chloride in the initial steps of preparing 25 OH D3 and U.S.Patent No. 4,001,096 Salmond January 4, 1977 where 25 hydroxy previtamin D3 is prepared via irradiation of cholesta 5,7 diene 38 , , 25 diol. In U.S. Application Serial No. 877,569 Hirsch et al, filed February 13, 1978 there is disclosed a process for converting cholenic acid to 25 hydroxycholesterol by application of the Willgerodt reaction. Further, in a series of studies by Johnson et al, J. Med.Chem., 20,5 1977 side chain analogs of 25 OH D3 have been prepared.The donor analog and the homovitamin were prepared from 23,24dinorcholenic acid and from 25 homo 3 5 hydroxychol 5 en 25 oic acid respectively. In each instance, the starting material was converted to the methyl ester and the 34 hydroxyl protected as the tetra hydropyranyloxy ether. Reduction with lithium aluminum hydride yielded the alcohol which was converted to the tosylate. Displacement of the tosylate with sodium cyanide gave the corresponding nitrile. Alkylatton with methyl lithium followed by acid hydrolysis yielded the hydroxy ketone which was subsequently converted to the previtamin and then irradiated. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 25 Hydroxycholesterol is prepared from cholenic acid according to the following sequence of steps. A. Cholenic acid is esterified. B. The 34 hydroxyl moiety is protected as an acid labile ether. C. Reduction with a hydride reducing agent yields the primary alcohol. D. The alcohol from C is converted into a leaving group. E. Displacement of the leaving group with cyanide yields the nitril. F. The nitrile is converted to the methyl ketone byC alkylation with a methyl organometallic reagent followed by hydrolysis. G. 25 Hydroxycholesterol is obtained by reaction of the methyl ketone with a methyl organometallic reagent. To obtain 25 hydroxycholecalciferol , 25 hydroxycholesterol is brominated to its 7 bromo derivative followed by dehydrobromination to the corresponding 7 dehydro compound which is subject to ultraviolet irradiation. See. e.g., U.S. Patent No. 3,846,455 Ikekawa et al November 5, 1974. Thus, it is the object of this invention to prepare 25hydroxycholesterol more economically and in greater yields than heretofore obtained. The 25 hydroxycholesterol obtained can be converted by conventional means to 25 hydroxycholecalciferol thereby yielding 25 hydroxycholecalciferol in greater yields and at reduced cost.

The excess methanol over stoichiometric amounts serves as the solvent. As catalyst, any acid source is effective, e.g., acetyl chloride, phosphorous oxychloride, paratol uenesul fonic acid, hydrogen chloride gas and the like.Useful inert solvents for the reaction are aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene and toluene, halogenated hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride, ethylene dichloride, etc., and ethers such as dioxane and tetrahydrofuran.Reaction temperature can vary from ambient to reflux temperature. With respect to Step B, protection of the 3 d hydroxy substituent can be achieved by protection as an acid labile ether using e.g., cycloalkenyl ethers such as dihydropyran, mixed acetals or other base stable protecting compound. Generally the ether, acetal, etc., is present in from about 1.5 to about 4 moles per mole of starting ester. Useful inert solvents for the reaction are aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene and toluene, aliphatic hydrocarbons such as hexane and pentane halogenated hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride, ethylene dichloride, etc. ethers such as diethylether, dioxane and tetrahydrofuran. As catalyst, any acid source is effective such as hydrochloric acid, paratoluenesulfonic acid, phosphorous oxychloride, etc. Reaction is carried out at temperatures between room temperature and reflux. With respect to Step C, reduction to alcohol can be achieved by reaction with any convenient hydride reducing agent such as lithium aluminum hydride, lithium borohydride, lithium tritertiarybutoxy aluminum hydride, etc., in an appropriate aprotic solvent such as ethers tetrahydrofuran and aromotic hydrocarbons benzene, toluene at low temperature to reflux using from about 0.5 to about 2.5 moles of hydride reducing agent per mole of ester. With respect to Step D, the alcohol can be converted to any good leaving group such as mesylate, tosylate, etc., at room temperature or below using from about 1.5 to about 2 molar excess of leaving group with a small amount of pyridine as solvent. With respect to Step E, formation of the nitrile can be achieved by reacting with inorganic cyanides such as sodium cyanide, potassium cyanide, etc., in aprotic solvents such as dimethylformamide, dimethylactetamide, dimethylsulfoxide, etc., at room temperature to reflux. A large excess of cyanide, e.g., from about a 5 to about a 10 fold molar excess is used. It is, of course, essential that the cyanide be at least slightly soluble in the solvent. With respect to Step F, methyl ketone formation can be achieved by reaction with from about a 5 to about a 10 molar excess of methyl organometallic reagent, e.g., methyl magnesium bromide, methyl magnesium iodide, methyl magnesium chloride and methyl lithium.Methyl lithium is the preferred reagent. Reaction is carried out at temperatures of 20 C to reflux. Useful solvents for the reaction are aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene and toluene, aliphatic hydrocarbons such as hexane and heptane and ethers such as dioxane and tetrahydrofuran. Thereafter, acidic hydrolysis is carried out.Simultaneously, the acid labile ether is hydrolyzed thereby regenerating the 3 6 hydroxy group. With respect to Step G, formation of 25 hydroxycholesterol can be achieved by reaction of the methyl ketone with from about a 5 to about a 10 molar excess of methyl organometallic reagent, e.g. , methyl magnesium bromide, methyl magnesium iodide, methyl magnesium chloride and methyl lithium. Methyl lithium is the preferred reagent.Reaction is carried out at temperatures of 200C to reflux. Useful solvents are aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene and toluene, aliphatic hydrocarbons such as hexane and heptane and ethers such as dioxane and tetrahydrofuran.
