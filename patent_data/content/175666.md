# Apparatus for gluing sheets of material together.

## Abstract
Apparatus for gluing together at least two individual sheets of material cut to finished dimensions, and intended to form parts of a folder consisting of a spine and two covers, said apparatus including two reception surfaces 2, 4 sit uated side by side, each defined by aligning members 6,8, 10 for aligning the two individual sheets in predetermined positions relative each other, a first conveying means 12 for moving one sheet away from its reception surface 4 to a gluing device 16 for coating at least one sheet with a glue bead, a second conveying means 14 for moving the second sheet away from its reception surface, at least one of the conveying means being adapted for moving one sheet rela tive the other so that both sheets overlap each other in the area of the glue bead, and a press means 18 for pressing together both sheets in said area. The apparatus also includes locating means 12a, b 14a, b which locate the sheets in said positions and are movable relative each other and together with the respective sheet for maintaining the locations of the sheets during movement of the sheets, their gluing together and pressing together.
