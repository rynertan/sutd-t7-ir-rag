## Description
PROCESS FOR CONVERTING A STEREOISOMERTC ESTER INTO ITS DIASTEREOISOMSR This invention relates to a process for the conversion of one stereoisomeric ester into its corresponding diastereoisomer. More particularly it is concerned with the conversion of R cyanonoxybenzyl S alpha i sopropyl chlorophenylacetate Isomer 1 into S alDhs cyano 3 phenolcybenzyl S alPha isopropyl 4 chlorophenylacetate Isomer 2 . Isomers 1 and 2 are two of the four possible stereoisomers having the following structural formula EMI1.1 The asterisks indicate the two asymmetric carbon atoms which give rise to the four possible stereoisomers. Ester A is described in Belgian Patent 801,946 as having pyrethroid like properties,including pesticidal activity and low toxicity to mammals. It is further known how to prepare or to recover the S form of the acid portion of Ester A, e.g., Japanese Patent Publications 75 25,544 and 75 106,935, and that the pyrethroid esters of such S acids are twice as insecticidally active as the corresponding racemate derived from both the S and R forms of such acids. The alpha cyano 3 phenoxybenzyl ester diastereoisomer pair derived from the S form of Ftlpha isopropyl 4 chlorophenylacetic acid can be separated resolved in small quantities into oily liquids by methods such as liquid chromatography. We have now found an efficient route to convert isomer 1 into isomer 2, or in other words, converting the less insecticidally active isomer into the more insecticidally active isomer. The invention provides a process for the conversion of R alpha cyano 3 phenoxybenzyl S alpha isopropyl 4 chlorophenylacetate hereinafter referred to as isomer 1 into S alpha cyano 3 Enoxybenzyl S alPha isopropyl 4 chlorophenylacetate hereinafter referred to as isomer 2 , characterized in that a solution in a suitable solvent of isomer 1, alone or in admixture with isomer 2, is treated with a base, and a proportion of isomer 2 is removed before, during or after the treatment with a base. The process according to the invention may be used to convert substantially pure isomer 1 into isomer 2 by treatment with a base followed by isolation of the desired isomer 2 from the resulting mixture of substantially equimolar properties of isomers 1 and 2. Also mixtures of isomers 1 and 2 containing a higher proportion of isomer 1 than isomer 2 can be used as starting material in the process according to the invention. Again treatment with base produces a substantially equimolar mixture of isomers 1 and 2 from which the desired isomer 2 may be separated. When equimolar proportions of isomers 1 and 2 are used as starting material in the process according to the invention it is necessary to remove a proportion of isomer 2 therefrom in order to permit the base to convert isomer 1 into isomer 2 up to the point at which equimolar proportions of the two isomers are present once a3ain. By removing further isomer 2 from the equimolar mixture the base can then convert more isomer 1 to isomer 2. Isomers 1 and 2 are esters of an acid containing an asymmetric carbon atom with an alcohol also conwain rG an asymmetric carbon atom and isomers 1 ana 2 are the two isomers resulting from the asymmetric carbon atom in tae alcohol portion of the ester. Both isomer 1 and is,,tr 2 h e the same configuration in their acid portions al it is surprising that the configuration of this acid portion remains unchanged throughout the process according to the invent ion when the configuration of the alcohol portion changes so readily. Separation and recovery of the isomer 2 produced may be achieved by any suitable method, for example chromatography or crystallization. Whilst the process according to the invention may be conducted in any suitable solvent, i.e., an inert material in which the starting isomer or isomers are soluble at the treatment temperature, it is preferred to employ a solvent from which isomer 2 crystallizes more readily than isomer 1. In this way it is possible to continuously remove isomer 2 from the mixture and at the same time convert isomer 1 into isomer 2 under the action of the base.The invention therefore also provides a process for the conversion of isomer 1 into isomer 2, characterized in that a solution of isomer 1 in a solvent from which isomer 2 preferentially crystallizes, alone or in admixture with isomer 2, is treated with base at a temperature below the melting point of isomer 2, thereby providing isomer 2 in the solid phase. In its broadest aspect the process according to the invention is carried out in a solvent which may be any inert material in which the starting material is soluble at the reaction temperature. Acidic materials, which would react with the base, are not suitable solvents. Suitable solvents include hydroxylic solvents, for example, lower alkanols containing from 1 to 4, preferably 1 or 2, carbon atoms, for example, isopropanol, butanol, ethanol, and, especially, methanol alkanes containing from 5 to 10 carbon atoms petroleum fractions rich in alkanes, for example, petroleum with a boiling range at atmospheric pressure of between 400C and 650C, between 600C and 800C or between 800C and 1100C petroleum ether cyclohexane mono or dimethylcyclohexane aromatic hydrocarbons having from 6 to 10 carbon atoms, for example benzene, toluene, o , m and y xylene, the trimethylbenzenes and p ethyl toluene chlorinated alkanes containing from 1 to 6, especially 1 to 4 chlorine atoms and from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, for example carbon tetra chloride, chloroform, di chloromethane, 1,2 dichloroethane, trichloroethane and perchloroethane chlorobenzenes, for example chlorobenzene and 1,2 or 1,3 dichlorobenzene ethers containing from 4 to 6 carbon atoms, for example diethyl ether, di isopropyl ether, tetrahydrofuran and dioxane nitriles containing from 2 to 6 carbon atoms, for example acetonitrile esters having from 2 to 6 carbon atoms in each of the acid and alcohol portions, for example, ethyl acetate. The preferred solvents, namely those from which isomer 2 crystallizes more readily than isomer 1 include hydroxylic solvents, for example, lower alkanols containing from 1 to 4, preferably 1 or 2, carbon atoms, for example isopropanol, butanol, ethanol and, especially, methanol and alkanes containing 1 to 8 carbon atoms. For best results, the difference in solubility of isomers 1 and 2 in the selected solvent should, of course, be as high as possible. Any base which does not itself fozm a stable reaction product with alPha cyano 3 phenoxybenzyl alPha isopropyl 4 chloropbenylacetate may be used in the process according to the invention. Preferably the base has a pK in the reaction solvent of less than 5 and may be organic or inorganic in nature. Examples of suitable inorganic bases include hydroxides, carbonates, and cyanides of alkali and alkaline earth metals, for example, sodium cyanide, barium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, calcium carbonate and sodium carbonates Suitable organic bases include alkali or alkaline earth metal salts of weak organic acids, for example, sodium acetate and magnesium formate, and organic nitrogen bases, for example alkyl, aryl or heterocyclic nitrogen bases, iiicluding mono , dior polyamines. Preferably, an organic nitrQ . base is an amine in which any alkyl group contains from 1 to carbon atoms and any aryl or aralkyl group contains from 6 to 20 carbon atoms and 1 or 2 hydrocarbyl rings.A heterocyclic amine may contain at least one ring nitrogen atom in a 5 or 6 membered heterocyclic ring optionally containing a sulphur or oxygen atom or another nitrogen atom. Suitable organic nitrogen bases include tri methylamine, triethylamine, piperidine, isoamylamine, benzylamine, diethylamine, tri n propylamine, tert. butylamine, ethanolamine, tetramethylenediamine, pyridine and morpholine.Most preferred organic nitrogen bases are secondary and, especially, tertiary amines. When the amine is a tertiary amine it preferably contains three alkyl groups having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, for example, trimethylamine, tri n propylamine, and, especially, triethylamine. The concentration of the base used in the process according to the invention is not critical. It may, for example, vary from 0.01 to 50 mol. based on the amount of starting material isomer 1 or isomers 1 2 , and is preferably 0.05 to 20 moi.P, more preferably 0.1 to 15 mol. . Normally about 10 mol. is used. The reaction may be conducted by preparing a solution of isomer 1 or a mixture of isomer 1 and isomer 2 in a suitable solvent and adding the desired amount of base to the solution.The reaction normally proceeds over a period of time of up to several days. The temperature is suitably from 500C to 500C, suitably 500C to 200C, and preferably 150C to 50C. Separation and recovery of the solid product from the reaction mixture can be achieved by methods, such as filtration, centrifugation or decantation of the mother liquor. The mother liquor can then be combined with fresh quantities of isomer 1 and optionally isomer 2 and this mixture re used in the rcess according to the invention. Tc reduce the time required to recover the isomer 2 from the reaction mixture, it may be useful to cool the reaction mixture, serarate off the precipitated crystals of isomer 2, for example by filtering, warming the mother liquor to about 50 C, and then rapidly cooling the mixture. This can be repeated several times. Seeding the reaction mixture with a small amount of crystals of relatively pure isomer 2 facilitates crystal libation, but is not essential. This preferred embodiment of the process according to the invention leads to crystalline isomer 2 in a relatively pure form. Such a compound has not previously been isolated. In view of the fact that the presence of base may cause isomer 2, either solid or in solution, to epimerize partially to isomer 1, it may be desirable to store isomer 2 in the presence of a small quantity of an acid. For example, solid isomer 2 may be stabilized by the presence of a solid acidic clay or a solution of isomer 2 may be stabilized by the addition of a small quantity of acetic acid. It should be noted that the process according to the invention does not require the presence of a chiral reagent, for example a chiral catalyst. This fact facilitates the economical conversion of, for example, a mixture of isomers 1 and 2 into isomer 2. It is most surprising that the process can be performed without affecting the S configuration of the acid portion of the ester. The following Examples illustrate the invention. EXAMPLE 1 A solution of 10.0 g of essentially equimolar amounts of isomersl and 2 i.e., 10.0 g of the diastereoisomer pair, R, S alpha cyano 3 phenoxybenzyl S alpha isopropyl 4 chloro phenylacetate , and 0.1 ml of triethylamine, in 40 ml of methanol, was cooled to 10 C and seeded with a small amount of crystals of isomer 2. The mixture was kept cool for 5 day by which tim more crystals had formed from the mixture in solution. The mixture was filtered and 8.2 g of solid isomer 2, m.p. 6000, were recovered.EXAMPLE 2 In a process analogous to that described in Example 1, isomer 2 obtained from the equimolar mixture isomers 1 and 2 using various bases and solvents as set forth in Table I below TABLE IRecovery of S alpha cyano 3 phenoxybenzyl S alpha isopropyl 4 chlorophenylacetate from an equimolar diastereo isomer mixtureSolvent Diastereo Catalyst Time, days Yield, isomer con at 100C alcohol acid centration diastereoisomer g ml isomer 2 Methanol 0.2 C2H5 3N 7 76 0.25 3 74 If 0.25 1I 5 82 0.25 II 5 80 0.33 5 52 0.25 Na CO 14 70Ethanol 0.25 C2H5 3N 3 43 0.25 7 45 0.33 6 00 60Isopropanol o.o6 II 27 00 37 ELUDE 3 comparison The process of Example 1 was carried out using diastereoisomer mixtures of other chemicals, such as alpha bromo 3phenoxybenzyl alpha isopropyl 4 chlorophenylacetate and alpha ethynyl 3 phenoxybenzyl alha i sopropyl 4 chiorophenylacetate, using methanol, hexane and methylene chloride as solvents, but without success.
