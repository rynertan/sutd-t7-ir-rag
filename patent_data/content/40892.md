## Description
A REGENERABLE PROCESS FOR THE SELECTIVE REMOVAL OF SULFURDIOXIDE FROM EFFW e 9 Sw Invention This invention relates to a process for the selective removal of sulfur dioxide S02 and mixtures of sulfur oxides from effluent waste gas streams. More particularly this invention relates to an improved method for regenerating an alkanolamine solvent used in sulfur dioxide absorption. 2. Prior Art and Background It is known in the art that heat stable salts HSS are formed during the absorption of SO, in alkanolamine solvent For example, the sulfate concentration in the absorbent is built up both by absorption of sulfur trioxide and or sulfuric acid mist which might be present in the stack gas and by oxidation of dissolved sulfur dioxide with oxygen.A further source of the build up of sulfates or other sulfur oxyanions is by disproportionation of sulfites and bisulfites.Such HSS include, in addition to sulfates, 5042 thiosulfates S20 32 dithionates S2062 trithionates S 3062 higher polythionates, SxO62HSS. A number of methods are known for the removal ofHSS from the solvent. For example, the sulfates usually can be removed essentially quantitatively through the use of an alkali metal hydroxide equivalent to twice the molar concentration of the sulfate. This results in substantially quantitative precipitation of the sulfate as the di alkali metal salt withour precipitation of sulfite or bisulfite ions U.S. No. 3,872,212 . However, other divalent sulfur oxyanions such as thiosulfates, dithionates and higher polythionates also build up in the system and cannot be quantitatively removed by means of alkali metal hydroxide precipitation.Furthermore, the presence of such other divalent sulfur oxyanions of HSS actively interfere with the quantitative removal of the sulfates. In some instances, as in U.S. No. 3,503,185, the combustion waste gas is prewashed to remove sulfates which are then purged from the system. Such prewashes are not capable of removing all sulfur trioxide as sulfate and, of course, would not remove sulfates formed in other parts of the process. This patent, furthermore, does not disclose any means for eliminating the thiosulfates, dithionates and higher polythionates. U.S. Patent No. 3,790,660 is similar to the above, in showing a water prewash to remove sulfur trioxide and fly ash. In addition, it specifies a purge stream to remove the sulfate as alkali metal salt. There is no system disclosed, however, for removing the thiosulfates, dithionates or other polythionates except by purging them with the sulfate in a waste stream. The latter is relatively dilute, poses a pollution problem in disposal and is expensive to handle. The use of alkanolamines, such as triethanolamine TEA , has been found to be a highly efficient way of absorbing S02 from waste gases in a cycle in which the alkanolamine solvent contacts the effluent stream to absorb the sulfur oxides, and is thereafter stripped by heat to release S02, whereupon it is collected for safe disposal.The stripped alkanolamine is then recycled back to the absorber for further contact with incoming waste gases and further absorption of sulfur oxides. This type of system is disclosed in U.S. Patents No. 3,620,674 and 3,904,735. HSS such as those mentioned herein above, accumulate in the recycling solvent to a troublesome extent and must be removed in order to maintain the absorption capacity of the solvent. The latter patent does disclose a sulfate purge cycle in which a portion of the lean absorbent is treated with potassium hydroxide or carbonate to precipitate out the sulfate as potassium sulfate.while this type of purge system is quite effective in removing sulfates, it is severely limited in removing other divalent sulfur oxyanions, which also interfere with the sulfate removal. There is no provision made in U.S.Patent No. 3,620,674 for removing these HSS from the absorbent which gradually but inevitably loses effectiveness because of the accumulation of HSS therein. Anion exchange resins have also been used to treat the total amount of a recycling absorbent, as in U.S.Patents No. 3,896,214 and 3,833,710. Both patents are based on removing all the SO and SO from the waste gases, 3 by utilizing ion exchange. This requires the utilization of extremely large amounts of resin and the use of large quantities of reagents to regenerate the resin. This is not only expensive but presents a considerable liquid waste disposal problem. In U.S. Patents No.4,122,149 and 4,170,628, the use of anion exchange resins is disclosed for the removal of heat stable sulfur oxyanions. In this case, the solvent is aqueous alkanolamine which is used in a cyclic process to separate S02 from waste gas mixtures, and only a slip stream of the recirculating solvent is passed through the ion exchange resin.However, the chemical and resin costs involved in this step comprised a significant fraction of the operating costs of the overall process. 3. Summary of the Invention It has now been discovered that an alkanolamine having a low boiling point less than 2500 C can be used as the solvent in a process for removing S02 from waste gas streams and the HSS build up therein removed by a process wherein a portion of the HSS laden alkanolamine solvent is reacted with at least one of the substances taken from the class consisting of alkali and alkaline earth oxides, hydroxides and carbonates to form solid inorganic salts. The alkanolamine solvent is then passed to a distillation zone maintained at less than 250 mm Hg and below about 140 C where the remaining dissolved salts are concentrated and removed and the volatile amine solvent is distilled and recycled back for further S02 absorption. 4. Drawing The sole figure is a flow diagram illustrating one embodiment of the invention. 5. Description of the Best Mode of the Invention The process of the present invention may be more fully understood by reference to the drawing illustrating one embodiment, which is the best mode presently known for practicing the invention. Referring to the drawing a gas containing undesirable S02 is introduced into the absorber 101 by means of Line 1 . As the gas flows upward, it contacts downflowing solvent which is introduced into the upper area of absorber 101 by means of line 4 , whil e monoethanolamine MEA is preferred in the best mode of operation, other solvents are equally suitable. These include dimethylethanolamine DMEA , diethylethanolamine DEEA , benzylamine, etc.The main requirements for solvent selection include 1 low volatility in the sulfite form, 2 low boiling point approximately 2500C at one atmospheric pressure in order to distill the solvent at a reasonable vacuum, 3 solubility in water, 4 high flash point, and 5 low rate of sulfite oxidation and disproportionation under absorber and stripper conditions, respectively.The temperature in the absorber 101 is in the range from about 30 0C to 600C, and a gas substantially free of S02, is removed overhead from absorber 101 by means of Line 2 . The amine solution containing the absorbed S02 is removed from the bottom of absorber 101 by means of Line 3 and introduced into stripper zone 102 . Temperatures and pressures in the stripper sone are in the range from about 80 C to 110 C, and 50 mm Hg to 500 mm Hg. Water vapor and S02 are removed overhead by means of Line 13 while the lean amine solution depleted in S02 is withdrawn from the bottom of stripper 102 by means of Line 4 and recycled to the absorber. The vapor stream 13 is cooled and the water condensed in condenser 106 and sent to reservoir 107 while the S02 is recovered via line 14 . For simplicity, items such as pumps, coolers and heat exchangers are not shown. Furthermore, it is understood that absorber 101 and stripper 102 may comprise any suitable number and arrangement of stages. As pointed out heretofore, the solvent gradually builds up heat stable salts which need to be removed, in order to maintain the capacity of the absorbent solution for S02 removal. In accordance with the present invention, a portion, usually 2 10 , of the recirculating solvent is segregated by means of Line 5 and sent to mixing zone 103 . In the best mode Na CO solution having a concentration in the range from about 20 wt to 50 wt is introduced into the mixing tank 103 by means of Line 6 where satisfactory mixing is insured. The amount of Na2C03 introduced will depend on the quantity of sulfur oxy anions introduced into mixing zone 103 by means of line 5 .However one equivalent of sodium cation is added per one equivalent of sulfur oxyanions. Other substances such as lime, limestone and other alkali or alkaline earth oxides, hydroxides and carbonates may be used. A slurry is withdrawn from the bottom of mixing zone 103 by means of Line 7 and introduced into a filtering zone 104 , wherein the insoluble inorganic salts are removed by means of Line 16 .It is to be understood that zone 104 may comprise any suitable means for the separation of solids from liquid, as, for example, filters, centrifuges and the like. The aqueous solution containing amine solvent and the soluble inorganic salts is removed from filtering zone 104 via Line 10 and introduced into a distillation zone 105 . Water and MEA are removed overhead by means of Line 11 , and the waste inorganic salts are precipitated and concentrated and withdrawn from the bottom of distillation zone 105 as a slurry by means of Line 8 , and joined with the slurry from line 7 in line 9 returned to filtering zone 104 . It is also possible to return the bottom slurry in Line 8 to the mixing zone 103 .In order to minimize solvent losses, a portion of the process water stream 17 is used to wash the filter cake and then returned to still 105 . The overhead vapor from distillation zone 105 is preferably recycled to the bottom of S02 stripper 102 by means of Line 11 thereby the heat utilized for distillation is substantially recovered in the stripping zone 102 .The temperature and pressure in still 105 are adjusted to minimize degradation and disproportionation products and also to recover substantially all the amine solvent overhead. This is preferentially accomplished by maintaining the temperature below approximately 140 C and by adjusting the pressure according to the particular solvent used. The aforementioned description is intended only to be illustrative of the best mode of practicing the present process and should not be construed to limit the scope or application of the concept of this invention.It would be obvious to one skilled in the art that various modifications could be made of the operation described above, without affecting the invention. For example, while the contaminants in the absorbent solvent in the above illustration were partially concentrated in filtering Zone 104 , it is entirely possible to by pass this step. Furthermore, the water and amine recovered overhead by means of Line 11 can be combined with stream 13 and recycled via lines 15 and 18 to the absorption process. It would also be apparent to one skilled in the art that the filter wash water shown in the process asLine 17 can be obtained from any suitable source such as makeup water to the process. Further the inorganic heatstable salts by products from the neutralization step, can be sent to a coal fired furnace. In this fashion, the salts are calcined to give off S02 and a residual oxide.Sulfur dioxide will be recycled back, along with the flue gas, to the sulfur recovery unit while the residual metal oxide will be disposed of along with the fly ash from the coal, and will help to neutralize the natural acidity of the ash. In addition, residual amine solvent which might be present with the by product stream, will be burned as fuel. All this will help to significantly reduce the waste disposal problem associated with sulfur dioxide recovery processes. 6. Experimental Data and Basis of the Invention An experimental program was undertaken to develop a process to regenerate amine solvents from HSS which would minimize high chemical costs and eliminate the large liquid waste stream. One process that appeared promising was a salt neutralization procedure to liberate the amine which could then be recovered by distillation. However it was unexpectedly discovered that there exists a critical relationship between solvent, temperature and pressure in order to achieve a satisfactory process. The following tests data illustrates the criticality of solvent, temperature and pressure. Test No. 1 300 g of a typical TEA solvent having a composition shown in Table I was mixed with 227 g of Na2C03.10 10 H20 and 100 g water. The solution was heated to approximately 8000 while mixing, until no C02 evolved. The mixture was then inserted in a standard roto flash evaporator and heated over an oil bath. The pressure was maintained at 20 mm Hg absolute.When the oil bath temperature reached 1 5000, discoloration started to occur. The bottom solution was a brown black sludge, while the overhead distillate was amber in color with a red oily substance. These disappointing results were thought to be caused by inadequate neutralization, and a second test was run with double the amount of sodium carbonate. Test No. 2 The following ingredients were mixed and the same procedure as in Test No. 1 was used. Similar results were also obtained. 300 g TEA solvent composition shown in Table I 454 g Na2C03. 10 H20 200 g H20 Theses results were even more disappointing in light of the fact that it is a common industrial practice to reclaimMEA solvent used for C02 removal by a similar method. To establish whether the type of solvent was critical, testsNo. 3 and 4, below, were conducted with MEA solutions, neutralized with both Ca OH 2 and Na2C03. Test No. 3 MEA solvent whose composition is shown in Table I, was neutralized with a 100 excess Ca 0H 2, using the same procedure as in Test No. 1. The mixture was then inserted in a standard roto flash evaporator and the pressure maintained at 100 mm Hg. Upon heating, at an oil bath temperature above 144 OC, some sulfur like material accumulated in the overhead, with slurry in the kettle turning yellow. Test No. 4 A similar procedure was used as in Test No. 3, except that Na2CO3 was used instead of lime. At an oil bath tempersture of approximately 140 C, a yellow sulfur like material appeared in the overhead with a darkening color of the bottom residue. It was then suspected that the presence of sulfur oxyanions in solution led to complications which are not encountered in C02 containing systems. The main problem being the formation, at temperature 1400C, of or degradation products which distill overhead and contaminated the amine.It was then thought that by opersting the distillstion step below approximately 140 C a reclaiming procedure of this type could be used. The following three runs were then conducted with test distillation apparatus which provided better control over temperature to establish the above criticality. The initial NEA solvent used in these experiments contained approximately 40 of the amine tied up as HSS, and was analyzed as followsWater, wt 96 25.1 MEA, wt 42.8 802, wt 16.6 Heat stable sulfur oxyanion 15.5 Loading, mole S02 mol EA 0.62 MEA as HSS Total MEA, M M 0.40 This solvent was mixed with water and sodium carbonate, in a ratio of 100 130.6 76.8, by weight, and heated to 10000 until degasing stopped. The slurry was then filtered and the filtrate used in Test No. 5, 6 and 7. Test No. 5 754 g of the above filtrate was fed into the test distillation apparatus and the experiments carried out at one atmospheric pressure. Overhead distillate cuts were taken with the results shown in Table II. At approximately 1550C bottom temperature, the residue had a greenish brown tint, and was greenish in color at the end of the experiment bottom temp. 16400 . Furthermore, the last overhead sample had a strong odor of hydrogen sulfide and or sulfur. Furthermore, the overhead distillate samples were analyzed and found to contain a higher ratio of MEA as HSS total MEA , than the starting feed 0.52 vs 0.40 . All these negative results indicated the unsuitability of the above procedure for solvent reclaiming. Test No. 6 Test No. 5 was repeated, except that the pressure was maintained at 380 mm Hg absolute, instead of one atmosphere. Similar results were obtained, and at a final bottom temperature of 155 C, the bottom slurry had a greenish color and the overhead sample had a strong odor of H2 S and or sulfur. The analytical results are shown in Table II and the average overhead distillate product had a slight increase in HSS over the feed 0.42 vs 0.40, MEA as HSS total MEA . Test No. 7 Test No. 5 was repeated at 100 mm Hg pressure and the results were very encouraging. The maximum bottom temperature attained in this run was 12800. The overhead product did not smell of H2S or sulfur, and the bottom slurry product did not have a greenish color, but rather a caramelbrown tint. More important, the object of this invention was finally achieved, as the recovered MEA overhead product was much lower in HSS content than the original feed solvent, 0.21 vs 0.40 see Table II . Test 7 illustrates that at temperatures below about 14000 e.g. 12800 and at pressures below atmospheric e.g.100 mm Hg using a solvent that has a boiling point below about 25000 a process for reclaiming the amine using neutrc, lization and distillation is achieved. 7. Advantages The main advantages of this invention over the prior art is that it provides an efficient and economical method of reverting alkanolamine salts to free amine suitable for 502 absorption. A further advantage is that it minimizes or eliminates the problem associated with liquid waste disposal as the only waste material is a relatively small amount of solids which can be easily disposed of. Still other advantages of the invention are that it can be readily integrated into existing S02 removal processes at relatively low investment costs, by utilizing the same condensing and vacuum systems used for solvent stripping.
