# High pressure discharge lamp.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a high pressure discharge lamp comprising an outer bulb accommodating a first and a second discharge vessel, these discharge vessels being connected electrically in series. According to the invention, the second discharge vessel is electrically shunted by a bimetal switch which is closed at a temperature of at least 300 K. The lamp thus starts in two steps, which facilitates the starting process and renders it more reliable.
