# Air diffuser for waste water treatment.

## Abstract
An air diffuser has a non porous diffusion plate 4 mounted on an air chamber 2 so as to permit diffusion of air from the inside to the outside of the chamber 2 . The diffusion plate 4 has a smooth outer surface and pores 9 extending therethrough, more than 95 of the pores 9 having diameters within 20 of a nominal diameter selected in a range of 50 300 Âµm. Air from a pipe 6 enters the chamber 2 through an orifice 7 and the size of the pores 9 permits generation from the pores 9 of uniformly fine air bubbles at a high diffusion efficiency. The smooth outer surface of the diffusion plate 4 prevents deposition of slime on the plate 4 when the diffuser is used in an aeration tank for waste water treatment.
