# PIPE MANUFACTURED FROM IRRADIATED POLYETHYLENE CONTAINING CARBON BLACK

## Abstract
A process for the manufacture of pipe, and the pipe so obtained, are disclosed. A blend of a polyethylene having a density in the range of 0.935 0.948 g cmÂ³ and 1 3 , by weight, of carbon black and which has been irradiated in an inert at mosphere while in the form of granules is fed to an extruder, extruded in the form of pipe and cooled. The irradiation may be electron or gamma irradiation and is in an amount of less than 1.5 Mrad. The preferred inert atmosphere is steam. The pipe has improved properties and may be used in a wide variety of uses e.g. construction of sewer lines and for transmission of li quids and gases and the like.
