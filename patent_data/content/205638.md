# Bidirectional power fet with integral avalanche protection.

## Abstract
Lateral FET structure is disclosed for bidirectional pow er switching, including AC application. Integral avalanche protection is provided by a pair of isolation regions 14, 16 forming protective barrier junctions 120, 122 with a com mon layer 6 , which junctions are in parallel with the re verse blocking junctions 70, 74 , of the power FET in the OFF state and have a lower reverse breakover threshold for protecting the latter. A plurality of integrated FETs each have left and right source regions 52, 54 and left and right channel regions 60, 62 , with a common drift region 64 therebetween, and conduct current in either direction ac cording to the polarity of main terminals 66, 68 .
