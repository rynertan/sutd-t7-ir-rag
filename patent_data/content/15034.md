## Description
WALKING AID DEVICE The invention relates to a device for preventing a walking aid from falling over comprising, attached to the walking aid, a pair of foldable standing legs which are joined to the walking aid at their upper ends by means of an upper hinging joint displaceable along the said aid between a lower and an upper position and are also individually connected with the walking aid by a rod which is hingedly fitted between a fixed lower hinging joint on the walking aid and a fixed hinging joint on the standing leg. One of the most common aids for patients who find difficulty oving about is the walking aid. Walking aids have a handgrip or a support, for instance for the armpit, and can be divided into walking sticks, elbow crutches and fore arm hoop crutches. The walking aid is used to ambulate. When its user sits down, for instance in a wheel chair, then it must be possible for the walking aid to be stood within easy reach. All one legged aids, however, are prone to toppling, for instance when stood against a wall. From US Patent No. 3,999,565 a walking stick is known featuring two or more foldable standing legs which make it possible for the aid to be stood upright and which are so sturdily constructed as to allow the user to transfer his body weight thereonto by resting a knee on a support which can be folded down from the said stick. A disadvantage of this known walking aid is that in ambulating the patient has to carry along the entire weight of the heavy standing leg assembly. The invention provides a device for preventing a walking aid from falling over comprising, attached to the walking aid, a pair of foldable standing legs, which are joined at their upper ends to the walking aid by means of an upper hinging joint displaceable along the said aid between a lower and an upper position and are also individually connected with a walking aidbyarodwhich is hingedly fitted between a fixed lower hinging joint on the walking aid and a fixed hinging joint on the standing leg, the said device not having the said disadvantage and further being attachable to any walking aid by simple means. This achieved in that the pair of standing legs in extended condition, in which the upper hinging joint is in its lower position, constitute together with the walking aid three points of support on a supporting plane, the three points forming an isosceles triangle in such a way that the projection of the upper hinging joint upon the plane of support lies within the said triangle, and in that spring means are provided which assist the movement of the upper hinging joint from its upper to its lower position and its being maintained in that lower position. By these provisions the walking aid can be stood aside in a slightly inclined position so that its centre of gra vity resides over the area of the supporting plane defined by the three points of support. Therefore, the standing legs can be constructed in a very light mate al, e.g. plastics, so that they will hardly add to the total weight of the walking aid. The upward force on the upper hinging joint resulting from the inclined position of the walking aid is relieved by the spring means, which also support the downward movement of the upper hinging joint. In the isosceles triangle formed by the three points of support, 0 the angle at the foot of the walking aid is preferably between 60 60 and 90 , as it was found that in that case the greatest stability was achieved with the walking aids in most common use. The upper hinging joint is preferably composedof an annular sliding member slidably embracing the walking aid and having the standing legs articulated to it. If tne attachment of an annular sliding member is attended with difficulties, the upper hinging joint can also be composed of a lengthwise and slotted tube attached with clamping strips parallel to the walking aid. This tube can then receive the sliding member to which the standing legs are joined. Another embodiment of the upper hinging joint can be applied if the walking aid consists of tubular material. The walking aid is then slotted lengthwise. The sliding member is inside the tube and hingedly connected with the standing legs. The spring means can be fitted below the sliding member and may consist of a helical spring or a length of elastic strap. The spring means at one end acts on the sliding member and at the other connects with a fixed point on the walking aid. It exerts a downward force on the sliding member. In the case of a helical spring this implies that at rest the coils are closer than in tension, the spring, hence, being an extension spring. It is also possible for the spring means to be disposed above the sliding member. In this case the use of a compression spring is preferred, i.e. at rest the coils are wider apart than in compression.In certain cases, e.g. where the upper hinging joint consists of an annular sliding member surrounding the walking aid, it may be advantageous for the coils of any extension or compression spring employed to be wound around the walking aid, the spring at one end residing on or being connected with the sliding member and at the other having a point of application on the walking aid. If the frictional forces between the various components is insufficient to keep the upper hinging joint in its upper position, means can be prcli ed to secure the upper hinging joint. This securing means are preferably operated from a point near the handgrip of the walking aid. They may consist of clamps. In order to also assist the user in raising the upper hinging joint from its lower to its upper position, pulling means can be provided acting on the sliding member and extending to a point in the vicinity of the handgrip. These pulling means can consist in, for instance, a length of steel cable, nylon wire, or string. With the aid of a few embodiments represented in the drawing, the invention is now further elucidated.The drawing shows inFig. 1 a front view of a part of a walking aid provided with a device according to the invention Fig. 2 a side view of a part of a walking device, partly shown in cross section according to Fig. 1 Fig. 3 a side view according to another embodiment of the device according to the invention Fig. 4 a part of the walking aid and the device according to the invention with a helical spring disposed above the sliding member Fig. 5 as in Fig. 4, but with spring means disposed below the sliding member. The device according to the invention shown in Figs. 1 and 2 comprises a pair of standing legs 1. The device is mounted on a walking aid 2. Walking aid 2 in this case is a walking stick of adjustable length. The portion of the walking stick shown comprises part of the tubular upper section 3, the tubular low er section 4, and the rubber shoe 5. The device is attached onto walking aid 2 by means of three clamps 6, 7 and 8. A tube 9 with longitudinal slot 10 is fitted to walking stick 2 by means of clamps 6 and 7. Tube 9 serbs as guide for a sliding member 11. The two standing legs I are joined hingingly under an angle to sliding member 11. The legs 1 each possess a free end 12, 13 and a rod 14, 15. By means of a hinging member 18 the legs 1 are articulated to the sliding member 11 about the axes 16 and 17, respectively. The rods 14, 15 are articulated about the axes 19, 20 to the legs 1. The rods 14, 15 are articulated, near the other end, about the axes 21, 22, to walking stick 2 by means of a hinging member 23 and the clamp 8. To prevent the legs 1 from collapsing when supporting walking stick 2, a length of elastic 24 is fitted between clamp 8 and sliding member 11. In stead of elastic also an extension spring may be used. Near the upper end of tube 9, which serves as guide for the sliding member 11, a clamp or spring 25 is provided, which cooperates with a lip 26 of sliding member 11. Thus it is possible for the sliding member to be secured in the upper position. By pressing one of the legs 1 onto the floor, the sliding member can be raised to its upper position, where it will be retained by spring 25. The legs 1 can be unfolded by a knock on the floor. It is also possible for the spring 25 to be connected with a wire 26 finger operable in the vicinity of the grip of the walking stick. By the length of elastic 24 the sliding member 11 will be moved to its lower position as soon as clamp 25 is released. Fig. 5 shows another embodiment of the device according to the invention. The guide for a sliding member 27 is formed by a lower section 28 of the walking stick. In this embodiment of the device, the legs 29 are folded against walking stick 28. The rods 30, which serve as levers for the legs 29, are hingedly joined by means of adapter 31 to the walking stick 28 Also a clamping member 32 and a length of elastic33 are employed to keep the sliding member 26 in its upper or lower position, respectively. In stead of a length of elastic, also an extension spring can be applied. In Fig. 4 an embodiment is represented in which an annular sliding member 34 is employed, with a compression spring 36 being wound as spring means around walking stick 35 to exert a downward force on sliding member 34. The helical spring presses against stop collart 37 disposed above it. Fig. 5 shows an embodiment in which the tension spring 38 disposed below the sliding member 34 also exerts a downward force on the sliding member. Here, in stead of the tension spring, also a length of elastic, designated with 39, can be employed, which is connected to the sliding member and to collar 40, which is integral with the lower hinging joint 41. The stop collar 37 in Fig. 4 and the collar 40 are attachable to the walking aid by means of clamping screws 42 and 43 respectively.
