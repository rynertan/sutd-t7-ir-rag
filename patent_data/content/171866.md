# Vibration tolerant whip antenna.

## Abstract
A mechanical vibration tolerant whip antenna having, in combination, a multi section conical metal tube having successive sections 2, 3, 4 each joined by an internal rigid rod 5, 6 tightly fitting within a corresponding recess in the respective ends of each of the adjacent sections to be joined with the outer metal surfaces of the successive sections providing a continuous smooth external metal surface transition, and each rigid rod 5, 6 extending sufficiently above and below a node of mechanical vibration resonance to provide rigid support to the node. Additional vibration tolerance is achieved by vibration damper inserts disposed within the tube near each node of resonance to damp vibration of the tube.
