# Electrochemical power generator.

## Abstract
An electrochemical power generator is disclosed which is composed of a plurality of unit cells stacked with interconnectors interposed therebetween said unit cells being each composed of an anode consisting of a porous carbon plate having on its one surface a plurality of grooves constituting gas passages and on its other surface an anode catlyst layer a cathode formed on its one surface with a cathode catalyst layer and applied on its other surface a hydrophobic material powder consisting of fluoropolymer resin, and an electrolyte layer interposed between the anode and the cathode in such a manner that its two surfaces are allowed to come into contact, respectively said anode catalyst layer and said cathode catalyst layer, the electrolyte layer being prepared by causing an acidic electrolyte to be impregnated into an inorganic compound powder having heat resistance and chemical resistance the interconnectors being each constituted by a high density carbon plate and having, on each surface contact with the cathode, a plurality of grooves for gas passages, being used, as an anode active material, of a gas consisting mainly of hydrogen and, as a oth cathode active material, of an oxidizing gas. First ribs 22b and second ribs 22a wider than said first ribs are formed between adjacent ones of the grooves 21 of the anode substrate 20 , and a catalyst is dispersed in the cathode substrate 27 over a range extending from a boundary between a surface of contact of the cathode substrate 27 with the cathode catalyst layer 28 up to a point located inside the cathode substrate 27 .
