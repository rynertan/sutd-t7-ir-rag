# Method and apparatus for controlling the ignition timing of internal combustion engines.

## Abstract
Method and apparatus for controlling ignition timing of an internal combustion engine wherein rotation speed information and load information of the engine are read in to calculate ignition timing data ϑADV , a correction amount ΔϑADV1 to be used to retard the ignition timing and representative of the magnitude of knocking is calculated when knocking of the engine is detected, the ignition timing data ϑADV is corrected in the direction of retardation based on the correction amount ΔϑADV1 , and the ignition timing data ϑADV is advanced at a predetermined cycle by a desired angle ΔϑADV2 at a time during the time period in which knocking is not detected.
