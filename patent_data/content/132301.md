# Antimicrobial composition including stabilized 2 mercaptopyridine 1 oxide and derivatives.

## Abstract
A biocidal composition suitable for use as a stabilizer in polymer systems using 2 mercaptopyridine 1 oxide or a derivative combined with an organophosphorus compound and a benzotriazole wherein the organophosphorus com pound and the benzotriazole act synergistically to stabilize the mercaptopyridine against degradation and discoloura tion of the polymer system.
