## Description
This invention relates to a method of writing reading value rated magnetic cards, in particular but not exclusively for public telephony. As is known, to enable public telephone sets, coins and or tokens only have been used in the past, although a prevailing trend favors today the use of enabling cards the adoption whereof has been dictated by the capabilities of current automatic telephony systems which afford direct dialing even from public terminals. The enable card systems proposed and utilized heretofore may be divided into two main classes credit card systems and debit card systems. Credit card systems utilize cards containing card identification data, data for activating counter units to count rate increments, and data for periodically issuing invoices covering such counts. The systems of the second type utilize instead value rated cards containing a preset number of rate units adapted for count down, this number determining the card face value. As for the nature of the cards, the choice is presently restricted to some basic types holographic cards, magnetic support cards, and electronic cards. This disclosure makes reference to public telephony systems using enable cards of the second type, and specifically magnetic support cards. Thus, the word card will be used for debit card hereinafter, and designates a magnetic support value rated card containing decrement rate units. Furthermore, while the invention is described in connection with public telephony systems, it may be appreciated that it can also be applied to other fields which make use of apparatus to be activated by means of value rated cards. The main objection to a widespread use of card systems comes from the problem of forgery, which in the instance of value rated cards is aggravated by the commercial value of the cards. The forgery problem may be fought at two levels, respectively a peripheral one and central one. At the peripheral level, prima facie recognition of the card validity is demanded to the reader associated with the telephone set, by providing the card with recognition data which may be coded. At the central level, a consistency check is effected on additional recognition data, typical of each card, which are interrelated univocally and not in accordance with preset criteria and decoded by specially set up central logic units. The card, moreover, is compared to a list of voided cards progressively stored in a so called blacklist . To avoid excessive burdening of the central checking devices, this invention is essentially directed to provide a method for peripheral checking, which is particularly efficient and based on the principle of recording on the debit card some form of a watermark which cannot be duplicated at a low cost but is quite readable by systems using conventional means and techniques. The object thus pursued is that of preventing the use of peripherally installed readers which may be easily stolen or duplicated as a means of directly counterfeiting the cards or means apt to provide the constructional details of the recording members and related operation. Another important object of this invention is to provide a card recognition method at peripheral level, employing a simple recognition procedure which uses, as informational units, the same informational units as are used at central level, processed in conformity with a code that cannot be reproduced with ordinary means. This promotes a simplification of the system as a whole and particularly of the electronics of the reader and validation means at peripheral level. A further important object of this invention is that of exemplifying the card whose structure is reduced to a mere cardboard piece, which may be flexible, having associated therewith the magnetic support which is formed by coated oxides or tape in conformity with conventional economically advantageous procedures. According to this invention these and other objects, such as will be apparent from the detailed description which follow, are accomplished by a method for writing reading value rated magnetic cards, in particular for public telephony as defined in claim 1. More particularly, the method comprises, for recording purposes, the use of a magnetic head having at least three windings for recording on at least three tracks strictly separated magnetically but perfectly adjacent, adjoining, and with the same length two coded signals, one of which is shared by the two side tracks the signals, preferably push pull signals, being recorded with strictly common synchronism on all the tracks and, for reading purposes, the use of a conventional head, having a single winding, which fully encircles the center track and the side ones over half of the respective widths the output signal from the readout head being the resultant of the algebraic sum of the readouts the marking form whereof, strictly dependent on the recording precision, constitutes the recognition and validation code. It will be readily understood how even a limited shift in the synchronism clock of the signal recorded on one track relatively to that recorded on the remaining ones, or cross over of the signals between the tracks, will alter the algebraic sum provided by the readout head with consequent considerable alteration in the shape of the readout resultant and consequent rejection of the cad. This restricts recording to the use of a very high technological contents head which can record simultaneously on the three tracks with total absence of cross over and strict observation of synchronism. On the other hand, the approach consisting of linking one half only of the side track magnetic flux carrying the same recorded signal during the readout step makes the structure of the related reader little restrictive, particularly as regards centering of the head with respect to the tracks, because any reduction in the width actually read of a side track is accommodated by a corresponding increase in the other, thereby the signal resulting from the sum of the two readouts does not change. The invention will be better understood from the detailed description which follows and by making reference to the accompanying drawings, given herein by way of example and not of limitation, and where Making initial reference to Figures 1 and 2,indicated at WH is a write or recording magnetic head comprising on a single magnetic core at least three identical windings X,Z,Y which, when suitably energized, record corresponding magnetic signals on as many tracks a b a with equal width on the magnetic support SM. For convenience of illustration, signals of the numeric type and with constant strength will be assumed, characterized only by the polar orientation of the elemental dipoles brought out by the arrows in the figure the polarity NS being represented by a vector pointing to left, the polarity SN by a vector pointing to right the absolute value of the vector being representative of the constant strength of the magnetic field. The recording head WH is fabricated to close tolerance to ensure a neat separation of the tracks for the magnetic effects and hence total absence of cross over between the tracks. On the side windings X,Y, a common signal is supplied which comprises an identical sequence of current pulses I₁...I At the clock points K, polarity reversal occurs in perfect synchronism on all of the three tracks. The magnetic support SM is associated with the debit card which is introduced into the validation device provided in the public set. That validation device comprises a conventional magnetic readout head RH, with a single winding W, which is sized to encircle the center track b completely and to encircle the side ones a a over half their width thus, the winding W links the entire flux of the center track and one half the flux of each side track. This permits, as outlined above, any misalignment of the head RH from the magnetic trace to be accommodated. In fact, if the misaligned head RH encircles, for example, one portion of the track a beyond the center line, the increase in the respective linking flux is compensated for by a corresponding decrease in the linking flux on the track a . The head RH reads the three tracks simultaneously. Thus, some signals cancel out and other add together to yield a readout resultant which comprises the algebraic sum of the halved signals of the side tracks and full signal of the center track. That resultant is shown, in analog form, in the diagram of Figure 2 and forms the card recognition and validation code. It may be appreciated from said diagram that the marking form or shape of the resultant signal is strictly dependent on the precision of the clocks C and K and on the total absence of cross over between the tracks, which circumstances are, in turn, strictly dependent on the close tolerances of the write head. In fact, in the elementar instance exemplified, the shape of the coded signal, included between two clock points K is represented by a pulse I resulting from the sum of the half signals of the two side tracks, a successive pulse J I resulting from the sum of the signals on the three tracks, and again by a pulse I. It will be appreciated that even a slight shift in the clocks C and or K of one or more tracks can deeply alter the shape of the readout resultant, thereby said shape is made unrecognizable by the electronics associated with the reader, which will issue a reject command. Like signal shape alterations are produced by a possible cross over between the tracks, in particular at the clock points, whereat the readout resultant cancels out. Thus, a sort of watermark is provided which cannot be duplicated with ordinarily known magnetic recording means. It should be noted that the aforesaid write procedures involve no special techniques in the manufacture of the magnetic support, which may be obtained in the usual manner, possibly by coating oxides over a generic carrier means, e.g. a simple cardboard piece. The readout resultant appearing in analog form across the head RH may be rewritten in digital form, e.g. by binary coding and contain a generic information which may and may not be transmitted to the central recognition system, such as numeric data concerning the serial number of the card or data consistent therewith. With these procedures it is also possible to record the trace of the rate units subject to down counting. Figure 3 shows one example of coded write in relating to an information item composed of five bits, of which two at 0 level and three at 1 level push pull signals . The first and third tracks contain the information, the center track the coding and clock procedure. The diagram of Figure 4 shows the readout resultant in digital form. Shown in ghost lines on that same diagram is the analog form of the readout resultant, i.e. the voltage pulses across the readout head, used to drive the digital circuits.
