# Digital navstar receiver.

## Abstract
A NAVSTAR receiver in which the received signals are processed to produce digitised quadrature signals I,Q at zero i.f. Baseband phasor rotation to effect Doppler tracking in the receiver loop is accomplished by deriving digital signals representing sin ωT and cos ωT for the required rotation angle ωT, multiplying the quadrature signals sepa rately and summing the outputs according to the algorithm I¹ I cos ωT Q sin ωT and Q¹ Q cos ωT I sin ω7, where I Q are the digitised quadrature signals.
