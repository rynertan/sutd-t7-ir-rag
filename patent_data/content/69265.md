# Mask structure for X ray lithography and method for manufacturing the same.

## Abstract
The invention provides a mask structure for X ray lithography, having a mask substrate 12 of an X ray transmitting material, a mask pattern 14 of an X ray absorbing material which is formed on the surface of the mask substrate 12 or therein, a support ring 13 for supporting the rear periphery of the mask substrate 12 , and a lattice shaped metal film 11 embedded in a lattice shaped slit in the mask substrate 12 . The mask structure with a large area has a dimensional stability.
