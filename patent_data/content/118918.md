# Starting device for gasoline engines.

## Abstract
A starting device for gasoline engines which may be started by spinning the crankshafts 8 thereof, and compris ing a torque transmission device 20 consisting of a male friction cone 22 adapted to be fixed in and turned axially by an ordinary electric drill device, and a matching conical female cup 24 adapted to be affixed concentrically to an engine crankshaft 8 and to receive the male cone 22 therein so that rotation of the latter rotates the former to start the engine. A novel connection of the cone to the electric drill permits misalignment of the drill axis with the crankshaft 8 , and damps the application of rotary force to the cup 12 to void shocks to the system.
