# A method of providing a layer of polymeric material on a substrate.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method of providing a flat and smooth layer of polymeric material on a substrate. The prepolymeric material employed in the method according to the invention, when melted, has a viscosity enabling it to flow into all crevices and voids on the surface of said substrate. The method includes the steps of applying a uniform coating of the prepolymer material on said substrate and heating the substrate to melt said prepolymer, whereby said prepolymeric flows on the surface of said substrate to provide a layer of said prepolymeric material having a flat top surface. Subsequent heating cures the prepolymer to form a flat and smooth layer of polymeric material.
