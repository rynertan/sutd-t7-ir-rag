# Porous nickel coated electrodes, process for making same and a paste composition used in said process.

## Abstract
An improved electrode having a surface mixture of nickel and porous nickel produced by applying a paste mixture of Ni Al₃ and Ni₃B together with a vehicle to a substrate. After burn ing off the vehicle and firing in air at a temperature of 450 to 650 C and thereafter sintering at a temperature of 800 to 900 C in nitrogen, the coating on the substrate contains Ni₂Al₃, NiAl₂B and nickel together with a thin overlayer of B₂O₃. After rernoving the intermetallic aluminum, boron and boron oxide by dissolution with sodium hydroxide, the surface of the sub strate contains Raney nickel supported on a structure of nick el. The resulting electrodes can be used as cathodes in water or brine electrolysis cells.
