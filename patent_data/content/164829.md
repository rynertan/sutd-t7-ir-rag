# Semiconductor memory device and method of manufacturing the same.

## Abstract
A semiconductor memory device has a semiconductor substrate of one conductivity type in which a plurality of memory cells is formed, each of the plurality of memory cells including at least one capacitor and having a trench 12 which is formed from one major surface of the semiconduc tor substrate so as to surround at least one memory cell, wherein a first insulating film 40 having element isolation properties is formed on the bottom and most of the side wall surfaces of the trench, a first conductive film 13 serving as one electrode of the capacitor is formed on the side wall of the first insulating film, thus making contact to diffused layer 62 , a second insulating film 2 is formed on the first conductive film, and a second conductive film 3 serving as the other electrode of the capacitor is formed on the second insulating firm.
