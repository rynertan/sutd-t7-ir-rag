# Oily water separator of the plate type.

## Abstract
An oil water separator has a stack of parallel corrugated plates between which the oil water mixture is constrained to flow, the plates being separated in said stack one from the other by spacing means provided thereon and defining first and second selectable spacings between any two adjacent plates of the stack. In a preferred embodiment the spacing between any two adjacent plates of said stack may be changed from said first predetermined spacing to said second or vice versa by turning one said plate through 180 DEG in its own plane.
