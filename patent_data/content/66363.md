# Microprocessor controlled fire sensor.

## Abstract
A fire sensor system can perform an analysis of the outputs of radiant energy detectors 12, 22 , by employing a microprocessor 30 to analyze the detector outputs. An amplifier 14, 24 is disposed between each detector 12, 22 and the microprocessor 30 , the microprocessor being provided with means for controlling the gain of each amplifier and means for stimulating each detector with at least one test stimulus.
