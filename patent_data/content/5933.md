# Manifold for internal combustion engine.

## Abstract
A manifold for an internal combustion engine comprises a plurality of body parts 1,12,17 each formed as an integral casting preferably by pressure casting. A first body part 1 has a mounting flange 2 for the manifold, a plurality of open channels 6 communicating with respective apertures 4 in the mounting flange, and a water chamber 8 communicating with a port 9 in the flange and a further port 10 in the first body part. A second body part 12 overlies the channels so that the first and second body parts define a plurality of gas conduits effecting communication between the apertures and a common orifice 7 . The first and second parts are sealed together along opposed side faces 22,25 adjacent their outer peripheral edges, rather than along abuting end faces. This allows access to the joints from the exterior of the assembly, permitting connection by electron beam welding or an adhesive, since all the joints are located on the exterior of the assembly a smooth interior surface is preserved and visual inspection of each joint is possible as it is made.
