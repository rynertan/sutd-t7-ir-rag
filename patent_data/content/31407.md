## Description
TITLE SUBSTITUTED 3 ,6 BIS AMINOALOXY ACRIDINES Brief Summary of the Invention This invention is concerned with new compounds ofEMI1.1 wherein n is the integer 1, 2 or 3 R1 and R2 are each hydrogen or methyl R3 and R4 are the same or different and are hydrogen or straight chain or branched alkyl C1 C4 and R3 and R4 taken together with the associated N itrogen is pyrrolidino, piperidino, morpholino or N methylpiperazino and R5, R6 and R7 may be the same or different and are selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, fluoro, chloro, bromo and nitro with the proviso that when n is one or two and R1 and R2 are hydrogen or methyl and R3 andR4 are lower alkyl then at least one of R5, R6 and R7 must be a substituent other than hydrogen. These novel substituted acridines form acid addition salts with a variety of pharmaceutically acceptable organic and inorganic salt forming reagents. These acid addition salts, formed by admixture of the free base form of one of the acridines of the invention with one, two or three equivalents of an acid, suitably in a neutral solvent, are formed with such ides as sulfuric, phosphoric, hydrochloric, hydrobromic, nitric, citric, lactic, tartaric, actic and related acids. For purposes of the present invention, the substituted 3,6 bis aminoalkoxy acridine free bases are equivalent to their non toxic acid addition salts. These substituted 3, 6 bis aminoalkoxy acricines may be readily prepared by treating one mole of the substituted 3, 6 acridinediol disodium salt with two moles of an alkyl halide of the formula EMI2.1 wherein x is chloro or bromo and R1, R2, R3 and R4 are as hereinabove defined. This reaction is preferably carried out in an inert solvent such as dimethylformamide at 75 1000C., for a period of one hour or more. The product may be isolated by removing the inert solvent from the reaction mixture by evaporation, taking up the residue in water and extracting the aqueous phase with diethyl ether. Evaporation of the ether provides the product which may then be purified by advance chromatography. Alternatively, the compounds may be prepared by reacting 3,6 acridimediol with 1,2 or 1,3 dihaloalkanes or l halo 2, or 3 hydroxysulfonyl alkanes in a solvent such as dimethylformamide for 15 minutes to 2 hours. The resulting bis haloalkoxy acridine can then be reacted with various mines of ammonia, preferably in a sealed bomb at 80 15O0C., for 10 50 hours. The product so isolated is purified as described above. The 3,6 acridinediol disodium salts may be prepared as described in the literature by treating substituted 3,6 acridinediol with sodium hydride at room temperature in an inert solvent such as dimethylformamide for 15 30 minutes. These acridine compounds also form complexes with metal atoms such as ferric chloride, zinc chloride, cuprous chloride, potassium hexachloroplatinate, chromic chloride and the like which are considered a part of this invention. This invention is also concerned with the use of the compounds of formula II antitumor agents and enhansors of the immune response EMI3.1 In the compounds of formula II , n is an integer 1, 2 or 3 RI and R2 are each hydrogen or.methyl R3 andR4 are the same or different and are hydrogen or straight chain or branched alkyl C1 C4 and R3 and R4 taken together with the associated N itrogen is pyrrolidino, piperidino, morpholino or N methylpiperazino and R5, R6 and R7 may be the same or different and are selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, fluoro, chloro, bromo and nitro as well as the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. In recent years, the concept of surgical adjuvant chemotherapy for the treatment of solid neoplasms has become widely accepted by clinical oncologists. Surgery is an effective treatment modality for the removal of the bulk of a large primary tumor, but often is not applicable to the removal of small, widely scattered metastatic foci of disease. It is recognized that the principal cause of death of cancer patients is the growth of unresolved metastatic tumor foci. Systemic chemotherapy, as an adjunct to surgery, is ideally suited to the elimination of tumor metastases, and has been responsible for much of the progress made in the treatment of human solid tumors. There are a variety of experimental animal tumor models that are used to assess the therapeutic effects of drugs on primary and metastatic tumor growth. The Lewis lung carcinoma is a highly malignant anaplastic murine carcinoma which when implanted subcutaneously gives rise to a large primary tumor that metastasizes to the lungs in the early stages of tumor growth. Surgical removal of the primary tumor is not curative unless performed within six days of tumor implantation, thereby preventing metastatic spread of tumor to the lungs. The actual cause of death of the experimental animals, even in the continued presence of the primary tumor, is the growth of the metastatic lung tumors.In this model system, therapeutic drug activity would be indicated by the inhibition of growth of the primary tumor thereby preventing metastasis formation , or in conjunction with non curative surgical removal of the primary tumor, by inhibiting the growth of lung metastases.This would be indicated by an increase in median survival time and an increase in the numbe.r of long term survivors i.e. sure8 among drug treated mice when compared to mice that had received non curative surgery and placebo instead of drug. Alternatively, the Lewis lung carcinoma can be implanted intraveneously in mice to establish artificial metastases in the lungs. Therapeutic drug activity, in this instance, would be reflected by an inhibition of the growth of these lung tumor metastases. The B16 melanoma implanted subcutaneously in mice gives rise to a large primary tumor which metastasizes to many distant sites. Surgery is curative when carried out early during the growth of the primary tumor, before metastatic spread of the tumor has occured. Systemic chemotherapy in conjunction with non curative surgery, has been demonstrated to prevent metastatic tumor spread or to inhibit the growth of metastases formed prior to surgical removal of the primary tumor. Effective chemotherapy, in the latter instance, is indicated by an increased median survival time or an increased number of long term survivors i.e. cures among drug treated mice when compared to placebo treated mice. The active compound of the present invention is active when tested according to the following procedures A Antitumor Activity of Acridines Against Intravenously Inoculated Lewis Lung Carcinoma in Mice Lewis lung carcinoma cells, 5x105 viable cells, are injected intravenously into BDF1 mice. The drug was prepared in normal saline and administered once daily, by the oral route, at doses ranging from 38 mg kg to 400 mg kg on days 1, 7, and 13 following tumor cell inoculation. A control group of mice received a saline placebo, instead of drug, by the oral route on the same days of treatment. All mice were sacrificed on day 19 following tumor inoculation, their lungs removed and individually weighed.Additionally, a group of 10 normal, non tumor bearing BDF1 mice, of the same sex, age, and body weight as the tumor bearing mice, were sacrificed and their lungs removed and weighed to determine the average normal lung weight. The average normal lung weight was subtracted from the weight of lungs from the tumored mice to determine the weight of tumorous tissue present in the lungs of the tumor bearing mice. A positive drug effect is indicated by a L58 reduction in the average lung tumor weight of the drug treated mice, relative to the average lung tumor weight of the saline placebo treated mice. The results of this test appear in Table I below.

B Surical Adjuvant Antitumor Activity Acridines Against LeWlS Lung Carcinoma Implanted Sub cutaneously In Nice BDF1 mice were inoculated subcutaneously in the right hind footpad with 5x105 viable Lewis lung carcinoma cells, on day zero. 3,6 bis 2 diethylaminoethoxy acridine trihydrochloride was prepared in normal saline and administered by the oral route once daily, on days 1, 7, and 13 following tumor inoculation, at doses ranging from 50 mg kg to 400 mg kg. A control group of mice received a saline placebo instead of drug, and another group of tumor bearing mice received the positive control drug cyclophosphamide, at 100 mg kg, administered by intraperitoneal injection. On the 11th day after tumor implantation r the mice were an esthesized with Nembutal, and the tumor bearing feet surgically amputated above the ankle joint. The surgical incision was swabed with alcohol and sealed with stainless steel wound clips. The tumor bearing feet were individually weighed and the average weight of a normal foot determined by weighing amputated feet from non tumor bearing mice of the same age, sex, and body weight was subtracted to obtain the weight of tumor tissue in the amputated foot.Mice were then observed for deaths until the 90th day after tumor implantation. A therapeutic drug effect is indicated by a a significant t 58 inhibition of growth in the primary footpad tumor, b a significant 25 increase in life span of drug treated mice, or c a statistically significant p 0.05 increase in the number of survivors at 90 days i.e. cures , relative to the placebo treated control group of mice.

Occasionally, however, tumor cells escape this immune surveillance and continue to reproduce and cancer results. The reason for the failure of the normally efficient immune surveillance mechanisms are not fully understood but it is thought that the immune system becomes less effective with increasing age. It is depressed in certain genetic immuno deficiency diseases, in various bacterial, fungal or viral infections, and in patients undergoing immuno suppressive therapy.The growth of the neoplasm itself, as well as the various therapeutic modalities designed to treat the disease, e.g., cytotoxic chemotherapy and viraliation, leads to a still greater depression of host resistance and results in an increased susceptibility to both exogenous and indogenous infections and perhaps accounts for the re initiation of tumor growth and metastasis which frequently follows treatment induced tumor remission. If depression of the immune system facilitates the growth of malignancies, regulation of any particular facet of immune responses may help the host to overcome residual cancer cells. Therefore, it is considered desirable to search for chemical agents i.e., immunoregulants capable of restoring and stimulating the host s own immune defense mechanisms in order to overcome the deficiencies which account for the increased susceptibility to disease and failure to eradicate the cancer.It is acknowledged that such immunoregulating agents would very likely be incapable of arresting the growth of a large rapidly proliferating tumor but that their clinical utility would derive from their capacity to enhance normal immune surveillance mecahnisms in pateints whose tumor burden has largely been reduced by conventional surgical, radiotherapeutic or chemotherapeutic methods. It would be hoped that the few producing a higher incidence of long term survivors or complete cures. Experimental studies in animals have demonstrated the anti tumor potential of a number of immunoregulants including live organisms of bacillus Calmett Guerin BCG , heat killed cells of Corynebacterium parvum, polynucleotides, and the anthelmintic drug, levamisole. These substances have been shown to stimulate cellular immunity and to produce tumor regressions. Some successes have been claimed in early clinical trials with BCG against malignant melanoma and acute leukemia and with levamisole against lung cancer and breast cancer. Although the antitumor effects produced by these agents have been promising, significant therapeutic benefits have yet to be realized. Since this is a very new therapeutic approach, new drugs and methods of treatment must receive careful clinical evaluation in order to reveal the full potential of these drugs. Modern research is directed to the discovery of a drug similar to, but more potent than, the known immunoregulants such as levamisole that would be effective in the eradication of tumor cells when used in conjunction with standard therapeutic measures. Stimulators of host resistance may be detected in animal models that can, in fact, detect both immunostimulators and anticancer agents. Mice are put in a condition simulating immunodepression common to cancer patients. This is accomplished by infecting mice either with a leukemia virus which produces both leukemia and a disease related immunodepression or with a transplantable mammary tumor. Effective drugs are recognized by their ability to restore or enhance the antibody response in the experimental mice. The active compounds and novel compositions of the the present invention are active as immunomodulators when tested according to the following procedures E Rauscher leukemia virus Rauscher leukemia virus is inoculated intraperitoneally into BALB C mice. The virus inoculum is a 20 W V spleen extract made from 21 day infected spleens of BALB C mice. All mice are within a three gram weight range, with a nimimum weight of 18 g., and all mice are of the same sex, usually male. Sheep red blood cells are injected intraperitoneally on the seventh day. There are 5 mice per test group. The test compound is administered orally on the sixth day as 0.5 ml. in 0.2 Noble agar in saline at a dose of 37.5 to 600 mg kg of body weight, and again on the seventh and eighth day, in the same manner. On the fourteenth day the mice are weighed and bled from the retroorbital sinus.The blood is pooled and the harvested serum is stored at 40C., for 24 hours. Hemagglutinin tests are performed by standard procedures using the microtiter plate technique. Acceptable hemagglutinin titer for leukemic immunosuppressed mice is 1 128.

The mice are then infected by subcutaneous injection with one LD95 of Columbia SK virus in a 0.2 ml. volume of distilled water. Groups of infected, untreated mice are used as controls to show the lethality of the infection. The test duration is seven days.Serum from surviving animals is collected and used to assay for interferon. The requisite number of monolayers of L 929 mouse cells in 60 x 15 mm. tissue culture dishes is prepared. The growth medium is minimum essential medium plus 10 fetal calf serum. Two fold dilutions of the serum starting at 1 10 are made. using minimum essential medium plus 2 fetal calf serum as a maintenance medium diluent. A 5 ml. portion of each dilution is added to each of three monolayer sutures and they are incubated at 37C. overnight. The monolayers are washed twice with warmed minimum essential medium and. then challenged with approximately 60 plaqueforming units dish of vesicular stomatitis virus in 0.5 ml.of minimum essential medium. The virus is adsorbed for 60 minutes at 370C., tilting the dish every 15 minutes to spread the virus and to prevent the monolayers from drying.Following adsorption, each dish is overlayed with 8 ml. of agar medium composed of one part 4 Noble agar containing 0.8 ml. kl. diethylaminoethyl dextran to seven parts minimum essential medium plus 2 fetal calf serum. The agar is allowed to harden and is then incubated at 37 CC. The plaque development is observed and stained with 0.1 crystal violet in 20 ethanol at the appropriate time 2 4 days .The number of plaques dish are counted, the average is calculated and the results are plotted on a curve versus dilution. A compound is considered active at a given dilution if it inhibits 50 or more of the plaque formation, the inhibition being due to the presence of interferon. The results of this test on typical compounds of this invention appear in Table 8. Protection of mice against lethal virus infection by oral pre trea tment with 3,6 bis 2 diethylaminoethoxy acridine trihydrochloride Groups of 20 random bred Swiss male mice were administered a single oral dose of 3,6 bis 2 diethylaminoethoxy acridine trihydrocyloride at 400 mg kg, tilorone hydrochloride at 200 mg kg, or a saline placebo.At 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours after drug treatment, separate groups of mice were injected SC with an LD95 dose of the interferon sensitive virus, Columbia SK. Mice were observed for a period of 14 days post virus infection to determine if drug pre treatment produced a significant increase in survival relative to the survival of placebo treated control mice. Typically, protection from lethal infection with Columbia SK virus is associated with induction of interferon. The results appear in Table 9.

No prior exposure of the animal to tumor cells or viruses is required for NK cell mediated target cell destruction. The resistance to growth of transplanted tumors in mice has been correlated with high levels of NK cell activity. The rapid rise in the level of NK cell activity in animals following infection with a variety of viruses, bacteria, or transplanted tumor cells suggests a possible role of NK cells in immune surveillance. It has recently. been reported that administration of interferon induces or interferon causes a rapid and substantial rise in the level of NK cell activity in mice. The results appear in Table 10. References to this stimulation of NK cell activity are 1 J.Y. Djeu, J.A. Beinbaugh, H.T. Holden and R.B. Herberman, J. Immunology, 122, 174 1979 . 2 S. Einhorn, H. Glomgren and H. Grander, Int.J. Cancer, 22, 405 412 1978 . 3 Authors unknown, Nature, 273, 759, 1978 . 4 Authors unknown, Nature, 277, 221, 1979 .Test Procedure Groups of 5 10 mice are administered test compounds or a placebo by oral, intraperitoneal, intravenous or subcutaneous routes. Approximately 18 hours later the mice are sacrificed and the spleens from each group of mice removed and pooled by groups. The pooled spleens are placed in 40C.serum free Eagle s minimum essential medium MEM and disrupted by gentle homogenation. The resulting single cell suspension is filtered through a 60 mesh nylon screen to remove debris and the cells are collected by centrifugation. The cell pellet is resuspended in 10 ml. of hypotonic phosphate buffered saline 0.0 M sodium chloride 0.001M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 for 5 10 seconds to lyse erythrocytes. A 40 ml. portion of MEM supplemented with 10 fetal calf serum MCM F is added and the cell suspension is filtered to remove aggregated debris. Spleen cells are collected by centrifugation, resuspended in MEM 7F and the cell density adjusted to 1 2x107 spleen cells per ml. of medium. Human or murine tumor cells are used as targets ofNK cells mediated cytolysis. Target cells are incubated in 0.5 ml. of MEM F containing 50 100u Ci of 51chromium as sodium 51chromate . After incubation at 370C for 1 3 hours, target cells are washed with three 40 ml. volumes of coldMEM F, to remove intracellular 51chromium. 51chromium labelled target cells are resuspended in MEM F at a cell density of 0,5 1 x 105 per ml. of medium. Triplicate assays of each cell suspension, derived from pooled spleens of test compound or placebo treated mice, are prepared to assess NK cell activity. Spleen.cells 5 x 106 and 51chromium labelled target cells 1 x 105 are placed in plastic 10 x 75 mm. Falcon tubes containing 1.0 ml. of MEM F. The tubes are incubated at 370C. for 4 hours, then chilled to 40C. and centrifuged. Aliquots of cell free supernatant medium are removed from each assay tube and the quantity of 51chromium released from lysed target cells is determined. A statistically significant increase in the quantity of 51chromium released in assays of spleen cells derived from drug treated mice, as compared to assays of spleen cells from placebo treated mice, indicates drug stimulation of NK cell activity.The compound 3,6 bis 2 diethylaminoethoxy acridine trihydrochloride is active in this test. The novel compounds of this invention do posess antitumor activity in their own right, and are chemotherapeutic adjuvants. In additiop,they potentiate the effect of anti tumor agents and act as adjuvants to surgical therapy.

H Lack of Effect on Normal Mouse Bone Marrow The effect of drugs on normal mouse bone marrow is evaluated by determining total cell counts of femurs and by the ability of surviving cells to form colonies in semi solid medium. The test compound is administered orally and the reference drug Cytoxan is administered intraperitoneally to C57BL6 male mice. One femur from each of three mice per dose level is assayed 24 hours after treatment. Counts of nucleated cells are performed on pooled marrow suspensions and the clonogenic assay is performed by plating 50,000 cells in one ml. of culture medium in each of four culture dishes. The medium to support bone marrow progenitor cell growth is McCoy s medium supplemented with 0.9 methocel, 1.8 human serum albumin, 10 bovine fetal serum and 10 conditioned L cell medium.Cultures are incubated at 370C. in a humidified atmosphere and baloneys are counted at seven days. The compound 2,6 bis 2 diethylami noethoxy acridine trihydrochloride had minimal effects on the total nucleated cell count while Cytoxan depressed the cell count significantly. The compounds of the present invention are effective as immunomodulators that is, they modulate the immune response when administered orally in amounts ranging from about 5 mg. to about 200 mg. per kilogram of body weight per day. A preferred dosage regimen for optimum results would be from about 5 mg. to about 50 mg. per kilogram of body weight per day, and such dosage units are employed that a total of from about 350 mg. to about 3.5 grams of the active compound for a subject of about 70 kg. of body weight are administered in a 24 hour period. This dosage regimen may be adjusted to provide the optimum therapeutic response. For example, several divided doses may be administered daily or the dose may be proportionally reduced as indicated by the exigencies of the therapeutic situation.A practical advantage of this invention is that the active compound may be administered in any convenient manner such as the oral or buccal routes or it may be incorporated directly in the diet. The compounds of the present invnetion may be orally administered, for example, with an inert diluent or with an assimilable edible carrier, or they may be enclosed in hard or soft shell gelatin capsules, or they may be compressed into tablets, or they may be incorporated directly with the food of the diet. For oral therapeutic administration, the active compounds may be incorporated with excipients and used in the form of tablets, troches, capsules, elixirs, suspensions, sy ups, wafers, and the like. Such compositions and preparations should contain at least 0.5 of active compound. The percentage of the compositions and preparations may, of course, be varied and may conveniently be between about 2 to about 60 of the weight of the unit. The amount of active ingredient in such therapeutically useful compositions is such that a suitable dosage will be obtained. Preferred compositions or preparations according to the present invention are prepared so that an oral dosage unit form contains between about 50 and 250 milligrams of active compound. The tablets, troches, pills, capsules and the like may also contain the following a binder such as gum tragacanth, acacia, corn starch or gelatin excipients such as dicalcium phosphate a disintegrating agent such as corn starch, potato starch, alginic acid and the like a lubricant such as magnesium stearate and a sweetening agent such as sucrose, lactose or saccharin may be added or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen, or cherry flavoring.When the dosage unit form is a capsule, it may contain, in addition to materials of the above type, a liquid carrier such as a fatty oil.Various other materials may be present as coatings or to otherwise modify the physical form of the dosage unit. For instance, tablets, pills, or capsules may be coated with shellac, sugar or both. A syrup or elixir may contain the active compound, sucrose as a sweetening agent, methyl and propylparabens as preservatives, a dye and flavoring such as cherry or orange flavor. Of course, any material used in preparing any dosage unit form should be pharmaceutically pure and substantially non toxic in the amounts employed.
