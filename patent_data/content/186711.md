## Description
METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR IMSARTIN G ENERGY TO SUBSTANCE BY USING HOLOGRAPHY TECHNIQUE BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a method and apparatus for entrapping or moving substance by imparting energy to groups of substance particles, for example gas, plasma, etc., by geometric development of wave energy occurring in holography technique capable of developing informations in a three dimensional space, and more particularly to a method and apparatus for entrappin ultra hI h temperature substance or imparting velocity to such ultra high temperature substance. Since the discovery of the principle of holography by Dr. Dennis Gator in the year of 1948, many developments and applications of the holography technique have been made and many references relating thereto have been published among which may be mentioned, Kazumi Murat ls text book Introduction toHolography , published by Asakura Shoten, March, 1979. Although methods have been proposed to impart energy, for example force, to material, these methods can be classified from the standpoint of technical view. According to a first method, force is applied to material by utilizing it as medium. More particularly, force is applied to a body by utilizing a solid substance as a medium or by utilizing a fluid as the medium. It may be considered that conventional mechanical method corresponds to the former method and that a fluid clutch, a steam turbine, etc., correspond to the latter method. According to a second method a force is applied to a body by using magnetic force as a medium. More particularly, this method corresponds to an electric motor, a plasma entrapping method and many other methods. According to a third method a force is applied to a body by utilizing electric force as a medium.More particularly, among these methods may be mentioned a method of attracting small bodies or particles by using an electrostatic force. According to a fourth method, a force is applied to a body by utilizing the gravity of the earth in which a fluid is passed through a pipe by utilizing the gravity. According to a fifth method, a force is applied to a substance by utilizing the energy of a wave motion. A concrete example of this method is an inertial entrapping of plasma utilized in a nuclear fusion reaction. Furthermore, methods of working workpieces by applying forces thereto have been proposed as disclosed in Japanese Patent application No. 62396 lid81 entitled A HolographyWorking Machine , and Japanese Patent Application No.67776 84 entitled A Working Machine Utilizing SoundWave Holography . The invention particularly relates to a method and apparatus utilizing the fifth method in which the energy of the wave motion is utilized. SUMiMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention contemplates solution of a number of problems which could not be solved by prior art technique owing to some obstacles. A first one of the obstacles is caused by the fact that the temperature of an object to be applied with the force is too high. A second obstacle is caused by the fact that the energy density of the force to be applied to the object is too high. A third obstacle is caused by the fact tat t variation with time of the force applied to the object is required to be highly accurate, and a fourth obstacle is caused by the fact that the force to be applied to the object should have a high spacial accuracy. An object of this invention is to provide an improved method and apparatus that can surmount various technical limits which prior art technique could not overcome, thereby obviating various obstacles described above. I have found that these obstacles can be solved b applying holography technique. A sound wave holography and an electron beam holography are included in the holography utilizing wave motions other than electromagnetic wave. To simplify the description, although an electromagnetic wave holography will be described hereunder, it should be understood that the principle is the same for other holographies utilizing other waves. A holography utilizing light wave can reproduce cubic images of which a cubic real image is pertinent to this invention. Optional realization of a cubic real image in a definite range can be effected by using a computer holography. A desired real image can be obtained by forming a hologram with the computer holography and then irradiating the hologram with coherent reproducing light. Computer holography is described in detail in French Patent ApplIcatIon No. 2391500, filed in 1979, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. In a holography utilized as photographic technique, light reflected by an object is caused to interfere with reference light and a photographic film is exposed to interfered lights to form a hologram. However, the hologram utilized in this case is prepared by calculating informations regarding design and mechanical motions with a computer and then depicting the result of calculation.Accordingly, a highly accurate hologram can be prepared. The reproduced hologram can be magnified with a magnifying factor of A A where represents the wavelength of light utilized to prepare the hologram and that of the light used for magnification or reproduction.In other words, a hologram prepared for obtaining a real image and having the same size as the object by using light of a wavelength X can be magnified with a magnifying factor of X by using reproducing light having a wavelength of A . Conversely, in order to obtain a real image of the magnifying power of X with reproducing light having a wavelength of , it is necessary to prepare a hologram with light having a wavelength of 2 . In this manner, in computer holography, any magnifying power can be obtained by adjusting the wavelength of the reproducing light and the hologram. This fact shows that a real image of high resolution can be obtained where a large hologram is formed and then reducing its size to form a reproduced image. The spacial point at which the holography real image is formed corresponds to a focus of a light flux, that is a high energy space high temperature space . This high temperature space actually, a very small region can be considered as three dimensional gathering point. Consequently, a high temperature point can be formed as a real image at any point in a definite space by utilizing holography, and a high teinperature space as an assembly of such high temperature points can be formed at any point in a definite region. More particularly, a computer holography utilizing an electromagnetic wave can form any three dimensional region in a definite region. Moreover, the high energy space can be controlled with time. The invention can solve various problems which have been difficult or impossible to solve with prior art technique by utilizing the fundamental characteristics of holography described above. According to one aspect of this invention there is provided a method of imparting energy to substance by utilizing holography technique comprising the steps of forming a light shell by utilizing real images produced by holography technique and subjecting the substance entrapped in the light shell to explosive compression thus imparting energy to the substance. In most applications the light shell takes the form of a split progressive multi layer spherical light shell which is expanded or contracted or moved to convey or accelerate the particles of the substance. Where nuclear fuel substance is entrapped in the light shell and heated to an extremely high tem perature, a nuclear fission or fusion reaction takes place. In other words, a nuclear fission reactor or nuclear fusion reactor embodying á novel principle of this invention can be obtained. After rotating a light shell entrapping particles of substance at a high speed along a hollow doughnut shaped orbit, and then releasing the particles in a tangential direction of the orbit, the particles are accelerated linearly. Where a poir of split progressive multilayer spherical light shells entrapping particle groups Ot equal mass are rotated at an equal speed about the center of an evacuated vessel, a gravity wave is produced. The method of this invention is also applicable to a holography working machine, to adiabatic expansion for producing articles of desired configurations and to many other applications.

In a preferred embodiment, a plurality of spherical light shells are formed concen trically to form a multilayer spherical light shell for imparting more energy to the substance.

When the nuclear fuel substance comprises a relatively heavy element a nuclear fission reaction takes place, whereas when the nuclear fuel substance comprises a relatively light element a nuclear fusion reaction takes place. Where the evacuated vessel has a double wall construction, such eat absorbing medium as air, water or mixture thereof is passed through a space between the walls.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Various applications of the principle of this invention will now be described.Embodiment 1 Method of entrapping substance in a single light shell by utilizing holography technique It is possible to form a closed single light shell 1K throughout the specification the term light covers any electromagnetic wave other than visible light having any desired configuration and thickness Ad in the inner space of a spherical hologram H made up of an assembly of numerous partial holograms Hi. This can be accomplished by irradiating from outside respective partial holograms Hi with reproducing light L the term light also covers electromagnetic waves other than visible light to realize respective portions of the single light shell 1K as the real image of the holography and to form a closed single light shell 1K made up of an assembly of the partial holograms as shown in Fig. 1.A method of entrapping a group of material particles for example, gas or plasma in the single light shell 1K having any desired configuration will be described as follows. For the sake of simplicity, it is assumed that the light shell is spherical and a single spherical light shell 1K will be described as an example.Fig. 2 shows a sectional view showing a single spherical light shell 1K having a thickness of Ad and formed by the method shown in Fig. 1 in a space inside of vacuum vessels 7 and 8 see Fig. 1 filled with gas, for example. Since the gas is heated by the single spherical light shell 1K , an explosion 1 and an explosive compression 2 occur as shown by arrows in Fig. 2. At this time, about 1 2 of the gas heated by the single spherical light shell 1El explodes toward outside and the other 1 2 of the gas is explosively compressed toward inside as shown by arrows. Accordingly, the gas would inertially be entrapped in the space inside of the single spherical light shell. Where the gas is strongly heated, it will form plasma. This method has been proposed to provide a laser nuclear fusion reaction.According to this invention, a phenomenon similar to the inertial entrapping caused by the explosive compression effected by heating the surface of nuclear fuel small particles with a laser beam can be realized by utilizing holography technique.Thus, the method of entrapping substance in the single spherical light shell can be applied to nuclear fusion reaction, but the detail thereof will be described later. The above described phenomenon was described with reference to gas and plasma, but the same principle also holds for liquid, a group of solid particles and a solid body. Regarding the method of inertially entrapping plasma described above, a method will be described in which the density of the entrapped plasma is increased and the entrapping time is controlled. Where the radius r of the single spherical light shell 1K is decreased continuously or intermittently, the plasma will be entrapped in a gradually decreasing volume, thereby increasing its density.This method also enables to increase the radius r of the single spherical light shell 1K , thereby decreasing the plasma density. By adjusting the speed of increasing or decreasing the radius r, the trapping time of plasma can be controlled. Concrete examples of these methods will now be described. A hologram can record a number of object lights in a superposed relation. The space frequency and the orientation angle of the interference fringes recorded on a hologram represent positional relation of a body with reference to reference light. Consequently, where a number of holograms of a number of spacially separated objects are recorded on one hologram in superposed relationship, it is possible to separately reproduce the images of these objects. At the time of multiplex recording informations of a number of objects on a single hologram, when the objects are sequentially recorded at a definite position while sequentially varying the angular distance and the orientation angle with reference to the reference light, respective interference fringes are coherently recorded at many times on the hologram. When the record is irradiated with reproducing light from a given angular distance and orientation angle, corresponding images of the bodies can be reproduced at their original positions. When a hologram is prepared with a computer by applying this principle, it is possible to obtain a coherently multi recorded hologram. When irradiated with reproducing light La in a given direction, a partial hologram thus obtained can produce the real image of a partial single spherical optical shell fa that is a part of the single spherical light shell 1K can be produced as shown inFig. 3. When reproducing light Lb is projected in a direction displaced by e from the orientation angle, a partial single spherical light shell fb which is a part of a reduced single spherical light shell 1K can be obtained. Where reproducing light which varies continuously or intermittently from La to Lb is applied to a hologram Hi obtained by continuously or intermittently and incoherently recording in multiple, it is possible to continuously or intermittently vary the partial single spherical light shell, that is a part of the single spherical light shell from to to fb.As an alternative, where a partial hologram Hi that can be varied mechanically or electronically is used, even with the same reproducing light L, the partial single spherical light shell can be varied continuously or intermittently from to The radius r of the single spherical light shell 1K formed by assembling a plurality of partial single spherical light shells can be freely increased or decreased. Embodiment 2 Method of entrapping substance in a multilayer light shell by using holography technique Entrapping of substance can be made more efficiently where the single light shell 1K shown in embodiment 1 is changed into a multilayer light shell NK . To form a multilayer light shell, each partial hologram Hi is irradiated with reproucin light from outside in the same manner as in Fig. 1 to form partial multilayer light shells Nk as the real image of holography. Then, a closed multilayer light shell NK can be obtained as the assembly of the partial light shells.It is to be noted that in the case of a single light shell 1K , a partial light shell corresponding to a partial hologram Hi may be a single layer real image, but in the case of a multilayer light shell NX , multilayer n layers real images must be obtained corresponding to partial holograms H. The multilayer real image can be obtained by a method utilizing multi records of the hologram and the multi focused images thereof.For the sake of simplicity, in the following, instead of a multilayer light shell NK , a concentric multilayer spherical light shell NK will be described as an example. As has been described in connection with embodiment 1, according to hologram, multiple recordings and multiply focused images are possible. As shown in Fig. 4, to simultaneously obtain multilayer real images f1, f2 , f with a single reproducing n light L, informations are coherently recorded in multiplex on the partial hologram Hi. More particularly, when a number of objects are simultaneously illuminated, and a number of interference fringes formed by lights reflected by the objects and a single reference light are simultaneously recorded on a single hologram, the information of these objects would be coherently recorded in multiple, thus enabling simultaneous reproduction of these objects by a single reproducing light. When a partial hologram Hi in which n multi layer real images of from fl to f that constitute a par n tial multilayer spherical light shell are coherently recorded as multilayers are prepared with a computer based on the above described principle, such partial hologram Hi can focus desired multi layer real images with a single reproducing light L. Fig.4 shows a hologram obtained by simultaneously converting into real images partial multilayer spherical light shells Nk f11 f2, ...., n of a multilayer spherical optical layer NK by projecting a single reproducing light L upon the partial hologram Hi. In this manner, a multilayer spherical light shell NK made up of an assembly of partial multi layer spherical light shells Nk corresponding to a multilayer real image thus obtained can be formed in a desired space. Fig. 5 is a sectional view showing the multilayer spherical light shell formed by the method just described. Since a first spherical light shell K1 can be deemed as the single spherical light shell lK, about one half of the plasma one of the examples of groups of substance particles near the first spherical light shell K1 in an inner space OV1 is accelerated toward inner side while the other one half is accelerated toward outside by explosion and explosive compression phenomena.As a consequence, in an n layer spherical light shell NK, where plasma presents only in the inner space oV1 first case , flowing out of the plasma to the outer space is blocked by the explosive compression 2 of respective spherical light shells K1 Kn so that the quantity of flowing out is reduced to 1 2 when the plasma passes through each spherical light shell. Thus the quantity of plasma flowing out to the outside space nVn l through n layers of optical light shells NK amounts to 1 2 times. Assuming that n 20, for example the plasma density P20 flowing out to the outside space 20V21 of multilayer optical light shell 20K becomes p20 1 2 20 1 1.05 x 106 , that is about 1 1,050,000, in which the size of the inner space OV1 is assumed to be unity.In the same manner where n 30, the plasma density becomes about 1 1,073,000,000. A case second case wherein the plasma is dispersed not only in the inner space OV1 but also dispersed homogenously throughout all spaces will be discussed. Since the plasma heated by each spherical optical shell is accelerated on both sides thereof, in a space 1V2 between first and second spherical shells K1 and K2 shown in Fig. 6 the plasma would be explosively compressed toward an intermediate position in the space 1V2. This phenomenon occurs in all spaces of oV1 to n 1Vn. Thus, the plasma concentrates at an intermediate portion of a space between two light shells so as to form high temperature plasma layers parallel to the light shells in the multilayer spherical light shellNK. Consequently, on an average, the density of the plasma is uniform. Thus, the density is the same in the inner space OV1 and the outer space nVn l. In this second case, a method of making different the plasma density in the inner space OV1 and the outer space nVn 1 will be described as follows.In the same manner as in embodiment 1, in which the radius r of the single spherical light shell 1K was varied, if the radius r of the multilayer spherical light shell NK were continuously or inteìttently decreased, the plasma would be entrapped in a gradually decreasing volume, and the plasma density in its inner space OV1 would become larger than that of a case in which plasma was uniformly dispersed.This object can be accomplished by a method combining the methods of multi layer recording shown inFigs. 3 and 4. This method is illustrated in Fig. 7.More particularly, a multilayer spherical light shell NK a having a large diameter rl is formed by assembling n partial spherical light shells afi i 1 n which constitute a partial multilayer light shell Nk so as to entrap the plasma in the inner space OV1. When the volume of the entrapped plasma is slightly reduced by the explosive compression 2 concurrently with the proportional reduction of radius rl, the density of plasna increases slIghtly. By continuously or intermittently repeating this process, the plasma density in te inner space oV1 can be increased gradually. After the plasma density in the inner space oV1 has been increased in this manner, the succeeding mechanism of entrapping the plasma is the same as that of the first case. As has been described hereinabove, in the embodiment 2, about 1 1,073,000,000 of the entrapped plasma flows to the outer space nVn 1 where the number n of the multi layer spherical light shells NK is selected to be 30, so that unless n is made to be infinity, flow out of the plasma cannot be reduced to zero. Where the quantity of plasma pushed inwardly by the explosive compression in each spherical light shell Ki is less than 1 2, the effect of entrapping decreases. Furthermore, the entrapped plasma flows out, a little by little, to the outer space nVn l with time. Yet the substance can be entrapped much more efficiently than the single spherical light shell 1K according to the first embodiment. Embodiment 3 A method of entrapping substance in a progressive multilayer light shell by utilizing holography technique More efficient entrapping of substance becomes possible by changing the multilayer light shell NK according to embodiment 2 into a progressive light shell. Such progressive multilayer light shell SNK can be realized by a method substantially equal to that shown in Fig. 7. For the sake of description, concentric progressive multilayer spherical light shells SNK will be discussed in place of the progressive multi layer light shell SNK . In the embodiment 2, multiple recordings on the hologram H were done by reducing the radius r so as to move that is progress the whole multilayer spherical light shell NK toward the center. However, it should be understood that the term progress used in the embodiment 3 has a different meaning.As shown in Fig. 8 the partial hologram Hi contains informations l f fn l coherently recorded in multiple, so that real images SNka of from fl to fn l can be formed simultaneously with a single reproducing light La. In the same manner real images SNkb of fo f n can be obtained simultaneously with a single reproducing light. Fig. 9 is an enlarged view of a portion of Fig. 8.Where the orientation angle of the reproducing light is continuously or intermittently changed from position La to Lb, if the positional informatiors at respective time instants of the partial multilayer spherical light shell were coherently recorded in multiple, a multilayer spherical light shell made up of an assembly of a number of partial multilayer spherical light shells could be progressed continuously or intermittently. Let us consider only one real image fn l The real image fn 1 firstly formed in the space by the reproducing light La e 0 progresses continuously or progressively to the position of a real image f as the orientation angle n e of the reproducing light L varies.Then the position of the real image instantly returns to the original position of the real image fn l to form a newly focused image and this process is repeated.In this case, the position of the focused image varies in a range between the partial serial lit shells f. and f. When this variation is repeated 1 i l for all partial spherical light shells the light shell fn 1 moves or progresses to the light shell fn and the variation is transferred to inner cycle from fn to fn 1. Thereafter the variation is sequentially transferred to create a phenomenon identical to a continuous movement or progress of fn 2r fn 3 ..f2, fl and f0, and the progress extinguishes at the position of light shell f0. According to this method of continuously moving the multilayer image, a real image produced at the position cf f 1 continuously progresses toward inside and extinguishes at the position of f 0. When fn l reaches the position fn a new real image is formed at the position of f n 1 which successively progresses toward inside. At this time, a portion of a n l layered spherical light shell is always focused.Thus, the progressive multilayer spherical light shellSNK comprising an assembly of a plurality of partial progressive multi layer spherical light shells SNk can be formed. A method wherein progression of the spherical light shell is effected by the cyclic operation and continuous advance can save the quantity of multiple recording of the hologram. In an electronic variable hologram using a large capacity computer this method is not always necessary. . However, eve in a computer system, where this method is incorporated into calculation, the capacity of the computer can be decreased. The progressive multilayer spherical light shellSNK thus formed can entrap the plasma tending to flow out to the outside space nVn l shown in the embodiment 2 into a newly formed n 1 th spherical light shell. More particularly, by suitably selecting the progression speed and the quantity of energy in the spherical light shell, the plasma can be efficiently moved toward inside. Thus, this progressive multilayer spherical light shell SNK can reduce to zero the quantity of plasma flowing out to the outside space. Further, where the progression speed is suitably selected, the number n of the spherical light shells can be decreased. Embodiment 4 Method of entrap substance bv slit progressive multi layer light shell by utilizing holography technique More perfect entrapping of substance is possible by splitting the progressive multilayer light shellSNK described in the embodiment 3. In the following, to simplify the description, a spherical light shell will be described as the light shell. In a progressive multilayer spherical light shellSNK formed by assembling a plurality of partial progressive multilayer spherical light shells focused by partially assembling one or more partial holograms Hi for simplicity this partial assembly is termed a partial hologram Hi , by adding the following performance to the partial progressive multilayer spherical light shell SNk formed by one partial hologram Hi, a partial split progressive multilayer spherical light shell BSNk can be obtained, and by assembling a plurality of light shells BSNk, a split progressive multilayer spherical light shell BSNK can be formed. Accordingly, where a partial split progressive multi layer spherical light shell BSNk formed by focusing a single partial hologram Hi is split into one or more parts, each part can be used as a unit of the partial split progressive multi layer spherical light shell BSNk. In this case, although the number of split units increases, for the sake of simplicity, a part formed by focusing a single partial hologramHi is taken as one split unit in the case of the electronic variable hologram it can be divided into more than 2 units . Fig. 10 is a sectional view showing a state similar to the partial progressive multilayer spherical light shell SNk shown in Fig. 8. In the case shown in Fig. 8 according to embodiment 3, a partial progressive multi layer spherical light shellSNk progresses at the same time as the other units and hence the progressive multilayer spherical light shell constituted by gathering the units also progresses simultaneously. As shown in Fig. 10, where internal pressures Q1 and Q2 caused by plasma differ from each other, it is necessary to create a difference between pressures acting upon the light shell in the opposite direction to maintain balance between the opposing pressures, thereby maintaining the entire configuration of the light shell. Among the basic methods of creating pressure difference across the spherical light shell are included Q method wherein the energy quantity of the spherical light shell is increased or decreased and a method wherein the progressing speed of the spherical light shell is increased or decreased. In the embodiment 3, since it is impossible to make different the progressing speeds of the parts, the former method of increasing or decreasing the energy quantity of the spherical light shell is suitable. In the embodiment 3, however, since adjacent partial progressive multilayer spherical light shells are continuous, the spaces therebetween are also continuous. As a consequence, the plasma flows out or into the shell, thus making it difficult to perfectly control the pressure difference at respective partial spherical light shells.In contrast, in the embodiment 4, a method is relied upon wherein the progressive multilayer spherical light shell SNK is perfectly split, and each split part is independent of the other split parts with reference to the space and the progressing speed. Fig. 11 is an enlarged view showing the portion shown in Fig. 10. In Fig. 11, the difference between the plasma pressures Q1 and Q2 in the inner space OV1 can be coped with by varying the progressing speed of the split part. For the purpose of spacially isolating the partial split progressive multi layer spherical light shell BSNKc from adjacent partial split progressive multilayer spherical light shell BSNKd with reference to the motion of the plasma, light interface walls U are provided at the interfaces between adjacent parts as shown in Fig. 11. The interface wall U may be a single light layer, or 2 or more light layers. In Fig. 11 Interface light walls U1 and U2 on both sides are merged into a single layer light wall. With the split progressive multilayer spherical light shell BSNK having a construction as above described, it is possible to completely entrap the plasma in the light shell while maintaining the internal space OV1 in its desired configuration.Since the embodiment 4 relates to a split progressive multilayer light shell BSNK , any desired configuration other than sphere can be used.Embodiment 5 Method of imparting speed by the move ment of a single spherical light shell 1K utilizing holography technique As has been pointed out in connection with embodiment 1, it is possible to form a closed single light shell 1K having any configuration and thickness Ad in a space inside of a spherical hologram made up of an assembly of many partial holograms Hi. Furthermore, the fact that substance, typically a plasma can be Inertially entrapped in the space inside of the single light shell lK has also been shown in embodiment 1.According to this embodiment 5, it is possible to change the position of the entrapped plasma, that is to impart speed thereto by using the single light shell 1K . More particularly, as shown in Fig. 12, the plasma entrapped in the single light shell 1K by explosive compression is heated continuously by the single light shell 1K so that the plasma would be continuously subjected to the action of the explosive compression. However, where the plasma density in the internal space is larger than that in the external space, the plasma flows out with time.For this reason, during this interval the plasma in the light shell would be subjected to the entrapping force caused by the explosive compression. As shown in Fig. 13, where the energy quantity on one side of the single light shell 1K is made larger than that on the other side, the force caused by the explosive compression 2 acts on one side to move the center of gravity P x, y, z of the inside plasma group as shown by an arrow 3. By causing the single light shell 1K to follow up the internal plasma group whose center of gravity P has been moved, the force can be applied thereby moving the plasma group.The adjustment of the single light shell 1K and the energy quantity is made as follows. The energy quantity can be adjusted by adjusting the energy quantity of the reproducing energy or by adjusting the spacial distribution of the energy. A method of multiple recording and reproducing of the hologram can be used for moving the single light shell 1K . Fig. 14 shows such states. To move the center P1 x1, y1 z1 of a single light shell 1K formed in a space inside of a spherical hologram H formed by assembling a plurality of partial holograms Hi, the method of multiple recording and reproducing of a hologram can be used.It is now assumed that, in Fig. 14, when reproducing light L1 is irradiated upon a multiply recorded partial hologram Hi, a partial single light shell kl is obtained, and that another partial single light shell k2 is obtained with reproducing light L2 obtained by varying reproducing light L1 by an orientation angle e. Since these partial single light shells kl and k2 can be obtained by using a coherently and multiply recorded partial hologram Hi, these partial single light shells k1 and k2 correspond to reproducing lights L1 and L2 respectively, while the image of an intermediate partial single light shell k can be obtained by using reproducing light at an intermediate orientation angle.Consequently, the single light shell 1N comprising an assembly of a plurality of partial single light shells k can be formed in the same manner, and its center is moved continuously from point P1 x1, y1 Zl to point P2 x2, y21 Z2 In another method a variable hologram can be used. Where a mechanical or electronically variable hologram is used, the orientation of the reproducing angle may be constant. Fig. 15 is a diagram showing a method of moving the plasma by moving the single spherical light shell 1K which is made possible by the method described above. At first, the plasma is entrapped in a single spherical light shell 1R having a large radius r, and the light shell is moved over a distance dl while gradually decreasing the radius. For the purpose of entrapping again the plasma gradually flown out to the outside it is assumed that the plasma on the outside is distributed uniformly during the movement, the single spherical light shell is extinguished while at the same time a new single spherical light shell lk3 having a larger radius r3 is generated. By repeating this operation, it is possible to extend the sustaining time during which the plasma is entrapped. As a consequence, the distance of moving the plasma by giving it speed can also be increased. The above described single spherical light shell 1K not only can entrap the substance over a definite interval, but also can impart a speed to the substance. Further, when this method is used in combination with the method of increasing or decreasing the radius r of the single spherical light shell 1K , it is possible to increase the interval during which the substance is entrapped and moved. The same is true for a single light shell 1R . Embodiment 6 A method of imparting speed to sub stance by the movement of a multilaver light shell utilizing holography technique The method of imparting speed to substance by the movement of the single light shell 1K according to embodiment 5 becomes more efficient by utilizing the multilayer light shell NK according to embodiment 2. For the sake of simplicity in the following, a multilayer spherical light shell NK will be described instead of a multilayer light shell NK, and a plasma is used as the substance. Fig. 16 is a diagrammatic representation showing the movement in the direction shown by arrow 3 of the plasma entrapped in the multi layer spherical light shell Ink . As has been described in embodiment 2, the multilayer spherical light shell NK can entrap at a higher efficiency than the single spherical light shell 1K. Accordingly, where a method of maldistributing the energy quantity in a light shell as shown inFig. 13 is applied to the multilayer spherical light shell NK , it is possible to impart speed to the center of gravity P1 see Fig. 16 of the entrapped plasma. The movement and energy quantity of the multilayer spherical light shell NK can be adjusted as follows. The energy quantity can be adjusted in the sa ..e runner as in embodiment 5.The movement of the multilayer spherical light shell can be effected by substantially the same method as shown in Fig. 15, but instead of using the partial single spherical light shells k comprising the single spherical light shell 1K, a coherently and multiply recorded partial hologram Hi is used to form a partial multilayer spherical light shell Nk and then a plurality of the light shells Nk are assembled to obtain a multilayer spherical light shell NK. Fig. 17 shows this state.As shown in Fig. 4 of embodiment 2, by irradiating a single reproduoing light L upon the coherently multi recorded partial hologram Hi, a partial multilayer spherical light shell Nk can be obtained, and by assembling a number of the partial multilayer spherical light shells Nk, a multi layer spherical light shell NK can be obtained. With this method, as shown in Fig. 17, a partial multilayer spherical light shell NK2 corresponding to the reproducing light L1 can be obtained and a multilayer spherical light shell NK1 can be formed by assembling a plurality of light shells Nk1. After that, a partial multilayer spherical light shell Nk2 corresponding to reproducing light L2 is obtained and a multilayer spherical light shell NK2 can be obtained by assembling a number of the light shells Nk2. By continuously varying the orientation angle e of the reproducing light for the multilayer spherical light shells NK1 and NK2 thus prepared, the center of the light shell Pl xl, y1, z1 can be continuously moved to a point P2 x2, y2, z2 .Embodiment 7 A method of imparting speed to substance by the movement of a progressive multi layer optical shell SNK utilizing holography technique The method of imparting speed or velocity to substance by the movement of the multilayer light shell NK according to embodiment 6 can be made to be more efficient by utilizing the progressive multilayer optical shell SNK according to embodiment 3. In the following, for the sake of simplicity a progressive multilayer spherical light shell SNK is described instead of the progressive multi layer light shell SNK and a plasma is used as the substance. As has been pointed out in connection with embodiment 3, the progressive multilayer spherical light shell SNK can entrap therein the plasma at a higher efficiency than the multilayer spherical light shell NK. Consequently, when the method of maldistributing the energy shown in Fig. 13 is applied to a progressive multilayer spherical light shell SNK shown inFig. 18 in the same manner as in embodiment 6, it is possible to imvart speed to the center of gravity P1 x1, y11 Z1 of the entrapped plasma so as to move it to point P2 x21 y2, Z2 . The adjustments of the progressive multilayer spherical light shellSNK and the energy quantity are made in the following manner. The energy quantity can be adjusted by the same manner as that described in connection with the embodiments 5 and 6, whereas the movement of the progressive multilayer spherical light shell SNK is accomplished by a combination of the method shown in Fig. 8 according to embodiment 3 and the method shown in Fig. 17 according to embodiment 6.Thus, according to the method shown in Fig. 8, the information regarding the position a position toward the center of concentric shells of the partial multilayer spherical light shell Nk which is formed by incoherently and multiply recording on a partial hologram when the position varies a partial progressive multilayer spherical light shell SNk would be obtained is caused to be focused at a position which varies with time by varying the orientation angle e of the reproducing light L.According to the method shown in Fig. 17 the information regarding the position of the center P, which varies with time, of the partial multilayer spherical light shell NK obtained by incoherently and multiply recording on a partial hologram the light shell becomes SNk with time is caused to be focused at a position which varies with time by varying the orientation angle of the reproducing light L. In other words, the methods shown in Figs. 8 and 17 are the same in principle. Accordingly, to simultaneously apply the same method to two objects, the orientation angle 8 is taken on X and Y axes of the rectangular coordinates, and the informations regarding the two objects are incoherently and multiply recorded on a partial holo gram Hi. Figs. 19A and 193 are graphs showing the relation between the reproducing light and the partial hologram Hi. Fig. 19A shows the relation between a reproducing light La and a reproducing light Lb obtained by varying the orientation angle of the reproducing light La by an angle a along X axis for attaining one object, while Fig. 19B shows the relation between the reproducing light La and a reproducing light Lc obtained by varying the orientation angle of the reproducing light La by an angle alona Y axis for attaining the other object.In other words, for the one object, angle r is varied as shown inFig. 19A and for the other object, angle ss is varied as shown in Fig. 19B. Furthermore, for accomplishing the other object, the angle a is made zero while the angle S alone is varied. According to another method, instead of varying the orientation angle of the reproducing light, a variable hologram is used. Where a mechanical or electronic variable hologram is used, as a principle, any desired real image can be obtained with only one reproducing light. It is also possible to use a method comprising a combination of the method of changing the orientation angle of the reproducing light and the method of using the variable hologram. Thus it is possible to obtain a desired movable progressive multilayer spherical shell SNK by assembling a plurality of movable progressive partial multilayer spherical light shells obtained by the methods described above. A movable progressive multilayer light shell SNK can be obtained by a simple method.Embodiment 8 Method of imparting speed or velocity by the movement of a split progressive multilayer light shell BSNK by utiliz ing holography technique The efficiency of imparting speed to substance bv the movement of the progressive multilayer spherical lht shell SNK according to embodiment 7 can be improve by utilizing the split progressive multilayer spherical light shell BSNK according to embodiment 4.In the following, for the sake of simplicity, a spherical light shell will be described as the light shell and plasma will be described as substance. As has been pointed out hereinabove in connec tion with embodiment 4, the split progressive multilayer spherical light shell BSNK can more perfectly entrap the plasma than the progressive multilayer spherical light shell SNK. As has been described in connection with embodiment 4, the split progressive multi layer spherical light shell BNK has a performance capable of coping with a pressure difference at a portion of the inner space OV1. Accordingly, it is possible to impart speed to the plasma entrapped in the inner space by moving the split progressive multilayer spherical light shellBSNK while manifesting such performance. The method of moving the split progressive multilayer spherical light shell is similar to that of the progressive multi layer spherical light shell SNK according to embodiment 7 except that although the embodiment 7 has a limitation that regarding adjacent partial progressive spherical light shells SNk, the progressions of these light shells toward the center of the multilayer shells must move in the same phase, but in the split progressive multilayer spherical light shell BSNK, there is no such limitation so that adjacent partial split progressive multilayer spherical light shells BSNk may have progression speeds of independent phases.Accordingly, it becomes possible to adequately cope with the internal pressure difference or exterior pressure difference when the direction of progression is reversed, te sign of the pressure becomes opposite . The number of splits or divisions is equal to the upper limit of the number of partial holograms where a fixed hologram is used because for independently operating respective splits it is necessary to use independent reproducing lights on the assumption that one reproducing light is used for one partial hologram.However, where an electronic variable hologram is used,as it is possible to obtain any desired image with definite reproducing light there is no limit for the number of splits. Where a variable hologram, especially computer controlled electronic variable hologram having a large freedom is used, all performances of embodiments 1 through 8 can be provided for the same apparatus.Embodiment 9 Method and apparatus for effecting controlled nuclear reaction by using holography technique Among nuclear reactions are included a nuclear fission reaction and a nuclear fusion reaction, each being reaiizable by enclosing nuclear fuel substance at ultra high temperatures. As an example, a nuclear fusion reaction will be described hereunder. Availability of a controlled nuclear fusion reaction, that is a nuclear fusion reactor is now the most important problem for solving the problem of supplying industrial energy. Consequently, numerous researches regarding the solution of solving conditions necessary for the nuclear fusion reaction have been made, and many papers regarding thereto have been published. It should be noted that one of the most important criterions is the Lawson s criterion. More particularly, Lawson has found that in the case of a mixed nuclear fuel of deuterium and tritium, for the purpose of satisfying the critical condition a limit point at which plasma becomes to balance with energy the product of the density of the mixture and the entrapping time should be equal to 1014 sec. cubic centimeter at a temperature higher than the ignition or trigger temperature.Later investigations have added various other conditions but values very close to the Lawson s criterion were obtained.The ignition temperature of the mixed nuclear fuel of deuterium and tritium is said to be about 40,000,000 OC. Certain other nuclear fuels require ignition temperatures of about 100,000,000 C. As above described, essential conditions necessary to realize nuclear fusion reactors are to heat the nuclear fuel plasma to ultra high temperatures, and to control the entrapping of the plasma at the ultra high temperatures. Prior art techniques for entrapping ultra high te perature plasma inclde a method of magnetically entrapping by using magnetic lines of force, and such method of inertially entrapping as laser nuclear fusion and ion beam nuclear fusion. The magnetic entrapping method is advantageous in that the plasma entrapping time is relatively long, while the inertial entrapping method is advantageous in that the plasma density is high. However, the advantage of these two methods is either one of the long entrapping time or the high plasma density, so that high efficiency cannot be expected. According to this embodiment 9, the nuclear fuel plasma is heated to ultra high temperatures and the ultra high temperature entrapping is controlled by using the holography technique. An inertial entrapping type nuclear fusion reactor can be realized by using embodiment 1. According to embodiment 1, a system similar to a prior art inertial entrapping system in which nuclear fuel pellets are irradiated or projected with a laser beam or ion beam can be realized by utilizing holography. In the inertial nuclear fusion reaction, at the tie of irradiating pellets, the outer shells of the pellets are heated so as to heat and compress the inside nuclear fuel by the explosive compression.The heating, compression and inertial entrapping satisfy the Lawson s criterion, thus igniting the nuclear fusion reaction for deriving out tremendous energy. According to one method of embodiment 9, heating of the spherical shell required for the explosive compression is accomplished by a single spherical light shell 1K of embodiment 1. In a single spherical light shell 1K utilizing the holography technique, spherical shell shaped heating can be geometrically realized at any position in a definite space region. Fig. 20 is a cross sectional view showing one example thereof. In Fig. 20, a single spherical light shell 1K a formed as a real image of a large diameter at the central portion by the method of embodiment 1 can entrap therein a low density nuclear fuel gas or nuclear fuel plasma injected into the space within concentric evacuated vessels 6, 7 and 8.Then the radius of the shell is decreased to reach a single spherical light shell lKb by continuing the heating, compression and entrapping the plasma.During this course the nuclear fusion reaction is ignited thus enabling to derive out energy. In the prior art inertial trapping system, since the entrap ping time is very short, about 10 8 sec., for example, the density of the nuclear fuel should be increased to about 103 104 times of that of solid which accompanies various difficulties. However, in the method of this embodiment 9 utilizing a single spherical light shell 1K whose radius can be varied, the position of heating by the single spherical light shell 1K is geometrically stable, and moreover since it is possible to continuously heat as desired, the entrapping time can be made much longer than about 10 8 second.As a consequence, as it is not necessary to compress the nuclear fuel to a value of 103 104 times of the solid density, the difficulty of reaching the critical condition can be greatly reduced.Furthermore, the energy of the single spherical light shell 1K can be increased by increasing the amplitude and the number of oscillations of the electromagnetic wave used. Thus, as a principle, the method of this embodiment 9 has a large utility. By generating in a pulse form the nuclear fusion capable of creating in a manner described above, a controlled nuclear fusion reaction can be realized. A method of deriving out energy generated by the nuclear fusion reaction will now be described.As shown in Fig. 20, the energy generated in the single spherical light shell lKb by the nuclear fusion rctio is spherically radiated as an electromagnetic wave, and a portion of the energy is derived out to the outside of the evacuated vessels 6, 7 and 8 as a burnt plasma. The electromagnetically radiated energy will now be discussed in detail. Fig. 20 shows a method of deriving out the electromagnetic wave energy generated by the nuclear fusion reaction by a medium flowing through a space between the evacuated vessels 7 and 8. In this case, gas or fluid is used as the medium, but a mixture thereof can also be used. Fig. 21 is a diagram showing an enlarged view of a portion of vessels 6, 7 and 8.Thus a space is defined between the outer and inner vessels 7 and 8 and gas for example, helium which is inert gas is passed through the space. A plurality of circumferentially spaced frames 6a, 6b .... each having a hollow square cross section are provided for the vessels 7 and 8, and gas 10 flowing out of the inner duct of the frame 6a flows between the outer and inner vessels 7 and 8 and cools these vessels and the partial hologram Hi. Thereafter, the gas flows into the inner duct of the frame 6b. Consequently, the energy of electromagnetic radiation 9 generated by the nuclear fusion reaction is absorbed by the evacuated vessels 6, 7 and 8 and the gas flow 10 and derived out to the outside by using the gas flow 10 as a medium.Thereafter, the heat energy absorbed by the gas flow 10 is used for electric power generation, for example, by well known method.The density of the gas acting as the heat medium should be small sufficient to further decrease the reproducing lIght L and diffraction light L passing through the partial hologram Hi. In this case it is possible to increase the capacity of the gas as the heat medium by increasing the flow speed of the gas. Although it is possible to use liquid instead of gas, in this case care should be taken not to generate bubbles and not to decrease the performances of the reproducing light L and the diffraction light L passing through the partial hologram Hi. Further it is possible to directly generate electric power by using thermocouples and without using any medium. Fig. 22 shows one example of using gas or liquid as the heat medium. In this case, a portion of the inner side of frame 6a is utilized as a fluid passage 11 for strongly cooling the evacuated vessels 6, 7 and 8 and for absorbing the electromagnetic radiations 9 created by the nuclear fusion reaction. Since this portion is not used as the path for the reproducing light L and the diffraction light L passing through the partial hologram Hi, it is free to pass liquid therethrough. Instead of the liquid, hlah density gas can be passed. Fig. 23 is a cross sectional view showing one example in which the evacuated vessels 6, 7 and 8 shown in Fig. 20 are spacially spaced from the partial hologram Hi. In the first case of this example, the interference fringes of the hologram H comprising an assembly of partial holograms Hi are spacially spaced apart or gaps are formed between adjacent partial holograms Hi for the purpose of permitting the hologram H to pass nuclear fuel gas or plasma, but not at super high temperatures . In the second case, the hologram H does not pass gas but acts as an evacuated vessel. In the first case, the reproducing light L and the electromagnetic radiations created by the nuclear fusion reaction are cooled and the energy is derived out through the evacuated vessel. In this case, as there is a fear that the nuclear fuel gas as deuterium tends to corrode the hologram H, a hologram supporting structure 12 and the inner wall 8 of the evacuated vessel, it is necessary to use corrosion resistant material for these portions. In the second case, as the hologramH itself acts as the evacuated vessel, the freedom of selection of the materials on the outside of the hologram H is increased. In this case, the evacuated vessel would have a double wall construction comprising inner and outer vessels, cooling and energy deriving out being made at the outer evacuated vessel in the same manner as in the first case. Fig. 24 is a cross sectional view showing a modification of Fig. 23 wherein the evacuated vessel and the hologram are spacially spaced apart. In Fig. 24, the hologram is arranged on the outside. In this case evacuated vessels 6, 7 and 8 similar to those shown in Fig. 20 are disposed on the outside for permitting passage of the reproducing light L and the diffraction light L . Since an inner evacuated vessel 13 is provided, nuclear fuel gas or plasma not at super high temperature is entrapped therein.Accordingly, on the outside of the vessel 13 there is no fear of corroding the material caused by the nuclear fuel gas. Thus, the degree of freedom regarding materials used increases. Where the heat of electromagnetic radiations created by the nuclear fusion reaction is absorbed at the position of the evacuated vessel 13, that is where the heat absorbing device is incorporated at that position, the cooling capacity at the positions of the outer evacuated vessels 6, 7 and 8 can be decreased. In Fig. 24, the real image produced by the reproducing light La is a single spherical light shell lKa, while the real image produced by the reproducing light Lb dephased by an orientation angle e from the reproducing light La is a single spherical light shell lKb. At first, the single spherical light shell lKa is formed by the reproducing light La for entrapping a large quantity of the nuclear fuel gas or plasma, not high temperatures .Then the orientation angle of the reproducing light La is continuously varied over an angle e to reach the position of the reproducing light Lb. Then the single spherical light shell 1K gradually decreases its volume to form the single spherical light shell lKb entrapping therein the plasma while gradually increasing the plasma density. However, after that since the entrapped plasma gradually flows out with time, entrapping over a long period is difficult. It is possible to form a nuclear fusion reactor by entrapping plasma by using embodiment 2. The system utilizing embodiment 2 constitutes an improvement of the system utilizing embodiment 1.More particularly, a multilayer spherical light shellNK according to embodiment 2 can entrap the plasma at a higher efficiency than the single spherical light shell 1K according to embodiment 1. Thus, use of the multilayer spherical light shell NK not only enables to heat the plasma but also enables to readily improve the plasma density as well as the entrapping time. Other conditions and apparatus are similar to those of embodiment i. It is possible to entrap plasma by utilizing embodiment 3 for preparing a nuclear fusion reactor.A system utilizing embodiment 3 constitutes an improvement of the system utilizing embodiment 2. Thus, the progressive nultilayer spherical light shell SNK according to embodiment 3 can entrap the plasma at higher efficiencies than the multilayer spherical light shell NK according to embodiment 2. More particularly, use of the progressive multilayer spherical light shell SNK not only enables to heat the plasma but also enables to readily improve the plasma density and the entrapping time. Moreover, the progressive multi layer spherical light shell SNK can entrap therein external plasma or conversely take out entrapped plasma to the outside by adjust ing its progression speed.Consequently, where this performance is utlized, if it is desired to increase the internal plasma density, different from the single spherical light shell 1K and the multi layer spherical light shell NK, it is not always necessary to reduce their radius r radius r may be varied and it is possible to discharge the inner plasma to the outside for decreasing the inner plasma density, thus enabling finer adjustment. Other conditions and apparatus are identical to those used in embodiment 1. It is possible to entrap plasma by utilizing embodiment 4 to form a nuclear fusion reactor. The system utilizing embodiment 4 constitutes an improvement of a system utilizing embodiment 3. A split progressive multi layer spherical light shell BSNK according to embodiment 4 can entrap plasma more completely than the progressive multi layer spherical light shell SNK according to embodiment 3. More particularly, use of the split progressive multilayer spherical light shell BSNK not only enables to heat the plasma but also to freely control the density and entrapping time of the plasma so that it is possible to effect nuclear fusion reactions utilizing various types of nuclear fuels. Accordingly, in principle, a nuclear fusion reaction such as P B reaction not accompanying neutrons is possible. This is extremely important for industry because if a nuclear fusion reaction not accompanying neutrons could be used practically, perfectly clean nuclear fusion electric power generation would become possible, thus perfectly solving the problem of energy on the earth. Other conditions and apparatus are identical to those used in embodiment 1. It is also possible to entrap the plasma for providing a nuclear fusion reactor by using embodiment 5, 6, 7 or 8. Thus the system utilizing embodiment 5 is identical to that utilizing embodiment i.The system utilizing embodiment 6 is identical to that utilizing embodiment 2 while the system utilizing embodiment 7 is identical to that utilizing embodiment 3. In the same manner, the system utiliz ing embodiment 8 is identical to that utilizing emDociren. 4. Further a system utilizing one or all of the embodiments 1 through 8 is also possible.Embociment 10 Method and apparatus for forming an evacuated working chamber of a holography working machine disclosed in Japanese Patent Application No.62396 81 by using holography technique Briefly stated, in the holography working machine, design informations of a product are realized as a spacial energy distribution by using holography technique actually, a computer holography capable of providing a spacial distrIbutIon of such wave motion energy as an electromagnetic wave, sound wave, etc., in a definite three dimensional space and then the level difference usually a temperature difference in the spacial distribution of the wave motion energy is utilized to actually produce a three dimensional product according to the design informations by sublimating vaporizable material. Fig. 25 is a cross sectional view showing one example of the holography working machine. In Fig. 25, a pedestal 16 supporting a workpiece 19 is provided at substantially the central portion of an evacuated working chamber 18, and one or more holograms Hi, one or more vaporized material supply nozzles 14 ejecting the vaporized material to a desired space and one or more vaporized material recovering nozzles 15 for recovering vaporized material remaining in the space are mounted on predetermined peripheral wall portions. The pedestal 16 is provided with a passage 17 for passing cooling medium for controlling the cooling of the pedestal. In Fig. 25 dot and dash lines 21 show the contour of the product to be manufactured, and 20 shows a section on the way of crystallization. This embodiment 10 contemplates realization of the evacuated working chamber 18, one of the important elements of the holography working machine, by utilizing the holography technique. Since the evacu ated working chamber 18 is filled with the vaporized material, in some case it may deposit on the inner wall 8. Where the manufacturing speed is low or a small product is to be manufactured, the quantity of the vaporized material is small so that the deposition speed onto the inner wall 8 is also small. However, in order to increase the manufacturing speed, the problem of deposition of the material onto the inner wall 8 should be basically solved. The embodiment 10 can completely solve this problem. By utilizing embodiment 4 it is possible to form, in an outer evacuated working chamber 18 , an inner evacuated working chamber 22 see Fig. 26 capable of entrapping vaporized material by using a split progressive multilayer light shell BSNK . Fig. 26 shows an example of the application of the em.boziment 10 to the holography working machine.More particularly, by forming the inner evacuated working chamber 22 in the outer evacuated working chamber 18 the problem of depositing the vaporized material 36 onto the inner wall 8 of the outer evacuated working chamber 18 can be solved perfectly. The inner evacuated working chamber 22 utilizing the split progressive multilayer light shell BSNK can be formed by assembling the diffraction light L passing through respective partial holograms Hi. Where informations regarding the product are recorded on a hologram an assembly of partial holograms Hi together with the informations regarding the inner evacuated working chamber 22, the same hologram can be used for simultaneously focusing the real image necessary for the working. Furthermore, since the contour and dimension of the inner evacuating working chamber 22 can be changed as desired in accordance with the configuration and manufacturing steps of the product 19, wasteless machining is possible. By utilizing embodiment 1, 2 or 3 the inner evacuate working chamber 22 entrapping the vaporized material 36 can be formed. Where the single light shell 1K of embodiment 1 is utilized, it is impossible to perfectly entrap the vaporized material over a long interval, but it is possible to maintain the density of the vaporized material in the single light shell 1K at a larger value than that on the outside. Where the multilayer light shell NK according to embodiment 2 is used, the efficiency can be improved over a case utilizing the embodiment 1. Where the progressive multilayer light shellSNK according to embodiment 3 is used, although it is possible to completely entrap therein the vaporized material 36 , in order to cope with non uniform variation of the internee pressure it is necessary to use a method of adjusting the energy quantity of the reproducing light L. In contrast, where embodiment 4 is used extremely versatile performance can be obtained. It is also possible to form the inner evacuated working chamber 22 capable of entrapping the vaporized material 36 by using embodiment 5, 6, 7 or 8.A system utilizing embodiment 5 is identical to that utilizing embodiment 1, and a system utilizing embodiment 6 is identical to that utilizing embodiment 2. In the same manner, a system utllizlna embodiment 7 is identical to that ut Ezlng embodiment 3 while a system utilizing embodiment 8 is identical to that utilizing embodiment 4. Furthermore, a system utilizing any one or all of the embodiments 1 through 8 can also be realized.Embodiment 11 Apparatus for accelerating particles by using holog at hv technique Particle accelerating apparatus indispensable for experiments of high energy physics, therapy and industry can also be realized by using holography technique. Prior art particle accelerating apparatus can be classified into a linear acceleration apparatus, a cyclotron, a betatron, a synchrotron and apparatus having combined performances thereof. Among them, t 1 acceleration apparatus and the cyclotron accelerate electrically charged particles by using electrostatic Coulon repulsive force. The linear acceleration apparatus is constructed such that a plurality of hollow electrodes are disposed coaxially in vacuum, and that charged particles injected into the apparatus are sequentially accelerated by successive electrodes. A cyclotron is constructed such that charged particles in an evacuated vessel are caused to be accelerated while moving along a spiral path G increasing radius.Betatrons and synchrotrons accelerate charged particles by using electromagnetic induction. A betatron gradually accelerates charged particles along a path in a hollow doughnut shaped evacuated vessel. In a synchrotron, an acceleration limit is increased by varying magnetic field while charged particles are being accelerated along a path in a circular disc shaped evacuated vessel. The particle accelerating apparatus of this embodiment 11 is basically different from these prior art particle accelerating apparatus in that it utilizes an electromagnetic wave. Furthermore, the apparatus of this invention can accelerate particles not charged with electricity. The particle accelerating apparatus can be formed by utilizing the method of imparting speed or velocity to substance by the movement of the split progressive multilayer light shell BSNK . The basic performances required for the particle accelerating apparatus are the capability of accelerating particles of various types, and the capability of accelerating various quantities. If these performances are fully satisfied, very excellent particle accelerating apparatus can be obtained. As shown in embodiment 4, a split progressive multilayer spherical light shell BSNK can entrap therein the plasma, and as shown in embodiment 8, it is possible to impart any desired speed to the entrapped plasma. In particle accelerating apparatus shown inFig. 27, the configuration of the split progressive multilayer light shell BSNK is designed to be a hollow doughnut having a diameter D at the center of the path and to dispose a piston 25 made up of the split progressive multilayer light shell BSNK in the hollow portion. After injecting a particle group 26 in the hollow portion of the doughnut, the piston 25 is rotated to push forwardly and successively accelerating the particle group 26. After reaching a predetermined speed, when a portion of the hollow doughnut shaped ring 23 is deformed in a tangential direction, the particle group 26 can be derived out in a desired direction.To increase the speed or velocity of the particle group 26, it is necessary to increase the energy density of the electromagnetic wave as well as the progressing speed of the light shell so as to increase the force of the split progressive multilayer light shell BSNKI necessary for entrapping the particle group 26, and to increase the rotational speed of the piston 25 constituted by the light shell. The energy density of the electromagnetic wave can be increased by increasing the number and amplitude of vibrations. In this case, it is necessary to cause the number of vibrations and amplitude to efficiently act upon the particle group 26. The number of revolutions of piston will now be considered. The maximum speed in the nature is the light speed. In an artificial method, however, there is a case apparently showing a speed higher than the light speed. As shown in Fig. 28A, let us assume that n electric lamps Qi i 1 n are disposed at an equal spacing over a straight distance of 300,000,000 meters, which is the distance in which a light flux 27 propagates in one second. When switches with preset times are sequentially operated, lamps 1 R Qn are sequentially flashed with an equal time n interval. Since the switches are preset, the interval between flashings can be selected as desired. If n is made infinity, and the flashings of the lamps are viewed from a far side it will be seen that a single light point moves at a speed higher than the light speed.Fig. 28B shows a state in which the light flux 27 has left the starting point A but not yet 8 reach an end point B 3 x 10 meters spaced from the starting point A. The signal of lamp R. which starts from the starting point A at the same time as the light flux 27 and proceeds toward the end point B in parallel with the light flux will be seen that it reaches the end point earlier than the light flu.Of course, this does not mean that an information issued by lamp t1 reaches n via n 2 3 For the reason described above, it can be understood that when the split progressive multi layer light shell BSNK which operates based on a predetermined infora2ticn moves in a pulse form, it will be seen that the light shell moves at a speed faster than the light speed. When the spacing between the distances of the movement of a pulse is made to be infinitely small, the spacing can be made to be less than a small fraction or less than the diameter of a particle, as a principle. Then it can be considered that the piston 25 constituted by a light shell acting upon the particle group 26 moves substantially continuously, so that it can be deemed that the piston 25 csr.stitqte by the light shell rotates at an ultrahigh speed. However, it is impossible to make zero the spacing between travelling distances. In addition, as it is impossible to make the speed of the particle group 26 to be higher than the light speed, it is impossible to push the particle group at a speed higher than the light speed.In the operation of the split progressive multilayer light shell BSNK, it is clear that the operating speed of a portion that requires feedback of an observed motion of the particle group 26 is lower than the light speec because cf the necessity of transmission of an information to be fed back. However, where the pressure generated by the light shell is sufficiently larger than the variation of the internal pressure caused by the particle group 26, as it is possible to perform a predetermined operation, feedback can be omitted. As has been described hereinabove, as a principle, it is possible to accelerate the particle group 26 to a speed very close to the light speed by the rotation of piston 25 constituted by the split progressive multi layer light shellBSNK .This shows that the particle accelerating apparatus according to this embodiment has the same or more excellent performance than the prior art particle accelerating apparatus. Fig. 29A shows a state wherein a split progressive multilayer spherical light shell BSNK entraps therein the particle group 26 and rotates along a circular orbit 4 of a diameter D. When the spherical light shell BSNK is extinguished momentarily the particle group 26 can be taken out in a tangential direction at a speed v. In this case, when the particle group 26 is compressed it would expand while flying, but when the initial speed is large, the percentage of expansion is small. It is also possible to accelerate the particle group 26 by linearly moving the spherical light shell BSNK instead of rotating the same along circular orbit 4. In the same manner, when the spherical light shell BSNK is extinguished if its speed reaches a predetermined value v, accelerated particle group 26 can be taken out. Instead of using the spherical light shell RSNK, when a oremntioned doughnut shaWec hollow ring is developed into linear shape, an ac celerated particle group 26 can also be taken out. Fig. 30 shows a method of rotating a high density particle group 26 at an ultrahigh speed along a circular orbit 4 having a diameter D. The force applied to the particle group 26 acts to compress and entrap the same and to rotate the group along the circular orbit 4. In Fig. 30, this force is generated by a combination of two split progressive multilayer spherical light shells BSNK and BSNK . The force contributing to the rotation of the particle group 26 comprises a force F2 balancing with centrifugal force and a force F1 for accelerating the particle group 26 in a tangential direction. The force acting upon the particle group is the resultant F of the forces F1 and F2. A crescent shaped light shell shown in Fig. 30 obtained by combining a split progressive multi layer spherical light shell BSK and a split progressive multi layer lit shell BSNK corresponds to the force F and the force entrapping the particle group 26. The crescent shaped light shell has a configuration of a force applied in the direction of the centrifugal force for creating a pressure corresponding to force F2. The light shell takes a form extending toward rear for corresponding to force F1.Since force F which is the resultant of forces F1 and F2 acts, when considered stationary, the applied split progressive multilayer light shell BSNK would have a configuration as shown by dotted lines in Fig. 30. Actually, however, as has been discussed in connection with embodiments 1 through 8, the particle group 26 is also distributed at the central portion of the crescent shaped light shell obtained by combining the split progressive multi layer spherical light shell BSNK and the split progressive multilayer light shell BSNK , and the light shell as a whole 26, BS 8K and BSNK is revolving along the circular orbit 4 at the ultrahigh speed v.Consequently, due to the transmission speed of force in the light shell and the distribution of the particle group 26, the light shell does not extend linearly toward rear side as shown by dotted lines but continuously bends toward the center of the circular orbit 4 near the tail. Consequently, the entire configuration of the light shell becomes a crescent. After rotating the particle group 26 along the circular orbit 4 with the crescent shaped slit progressive multilayer light shell combination of the light shells BSNK and BSNK for gradually acceleratIng the particle group 26, when the light shell is momentarily extinguished upon reaching a predetermined speed, the particle group 26 can be taken out in the tangential direction.In this case, when the particle group 26 has been compressed it will fly while expanding. But as has been pointed out before, when the sped v is high, the percentage of expansion would be decreased. Fig. 31 illustrates a linear type particle accelerating apparatus. Fig. 31 shows a state in which a particle group M is entrapped in a light shell for example, a split progressive multilayer spherical light shell BSNK and the particle group M is linearly accelerated by simultaneously moving the light shell.The energy acting upon the particle group M. is the diffractive light L from nearby partial holograms Hi.Successive change of the partial holograms utilized in parallel with the movement of the particle groupM to nearby partial holograms is possible by using a computer controlled variable hologram. The accelerated particle group X passes as it is through a vacuum pump 47 made up of a light shell light shells SNK and BSNK act as a pump or only a portion of the light shell passing through the pump is ext nguishea. Thus the accelerated particle group can e taken out to the external space via a plenum carrier 48 of an evacuated vessel and through another vacuum pump 47A. Fig. 32a shows the cross section of Fig. 31 taken along a line XXXIIa XXXIIa. This figure shows a state in which a light shell is formed by diffractive light L from surrounding partial holograms Hi for entrapping and accelerating particle group M therein. Fig. 32b shows a cross section of Fig. 31 taken along a line XXXIIb XXXIIb. Fig. 32b shows that an opening 46 of a partition wall 49 is partially closed by the vacuum pump 47 made up of a light shell and that air is evacuated to maintain the interior at a highly evacuated condition. Particle accelerating apparatus having a circular orbit can be connected to the rear of the linear particle accelerating apparatus described above for performing an initial acceleration with the circular orbit. By developing the theory of this particle accelerating apparatus, gravity wave generating apparatus can be obtained. Although presence of the gravity wave has not been confirmed experimentally, its presence has been theoretically proven by Einstein s theorem of relativity and the conditions necessary to generate the same have been qualitatIvely Frozen. The trtnss of the Einstein s theorem of relativity is now recognized by almost all of the physical engineers in the world as a result of hits of numerous astronomical predictions confirmation by experiment or observation . Regarding the gravity wave reference is made to z text boo entitled The Search forGravity Waves by P.C.W. Davies, published b Carflridge University Press, 1980.Yet any gravity wave generating apparatus is not available only for the reason that a method for realizing apparatus capable of satisfying conditions revealed quantitatively according to the theorem has not been found.In the following, a method of preparing gravity wave generating apparatus acting as extremely powerful particle accelerating apparatus capable of effectively satisfying the conditions of generating the gravity wave will be described. As a principle, generation of the gravity wave is very simple, that is requiring only variable mass quadruple poles. For example, a structure as shown in Fig. 33 is sufficient in which two equal masses N are interconnected with a spring 29. Furthermore, a rod 31 rotating about an axis 32 as shown by arrow 28 in Fig. 34A also constitutes a gravity wave generating apparatus. As shown in Fig. 34B, the projection of rod 31 expands and contracts while rotatIng between the front surface and the side surface of the rod 31 when viewed from the surface of rc ati. This motion constitutes vibrating mass quadruple poles. However, there is a problem that the gravity wave generating apparatus utilizing this method can produce only a very small output. For example, the output obtainable when an iron rod 31 of 100,000 tons is rotated once per second is 10 24J sec. J sec. represents watts. If one 12 wishes to light a household lamp, a power of 1012 x 1012 times of the power described above is necessary.Consequently the technical value of these gravity wave generating apparatus is very small. In summary, a large gravity wave effect can be provided only by a system moving at a speed close to the light speed v c and having extremely small radius close to the gravity radius D r g Fig. 35 shows a state in which 1800 opposed two equal masses M are rotated in the same direction and at the same speed v along a circular orbit 4 having a diameter D. This motion creates vibrating mass quadruple poles. To efficiently generate gravity wave by utilizing this phenomenon, it is necessary to cause the speed v to approximate the light speed c and to make the diameter D of the circular orbit 4 close to the gravity radius rg since the calculation is an approximate calculation of a large number of orders of magnitude, for the sa k e c brevity, it is assumed that diameter D radius r . In the following, approximate calculations are shown. The power output of the gravity wave shown inFig. 35 can be approximately given by the following well known equation. r D 2 . v c 6 c5 G 1 The gravity radius rg is given by the following well known equation. rg 2GM c2 ................... 2 where G represents a gravity constant, and c light speed. As an example, assume now that mass M 500Kg, its diameter 10 5 m, diameter D of the orbit 10 m, speed v 0.9c c light speed , and by substituting these values in equations 1 and 2 we obtain rg 2GM c2 2 2 x 6.67 x 10 11 x 500 I 3 x 108 2 7.4 x 1Q 25m. Hence rg D 2. v c 6.c5 G 7.4 x 10 25 10 4 2 x 0.9 1 6 x 3 x 108 5 6.67 x 10 11 1.06 x 1012 J sec. The power outputted by the gravity wave is about 1 x 1012 watts corresponding to about 1,300,000,000 horse powers. Where the mass M has a diameter of 10 5 m ane a weight of 500 Kg, its density is about 1 10 of the neutron density. Where such ultra hig density mass M is made as a sphere having a diameter of 10 5 m 1 100 mm and if it were possible to rotate the sphere at an ultra high speed v corresponding to 90 of the light velocity c it would be possible to obtain very efficient gravity wave generating apparatus. Above illustrated data is only one example and where the output is less than 1 x 1012 watts, the conditions are alleviated. Of course it should be understood that higher Output is possible as a principle. Fig. 36 diagrammatically shows that reproducing light L is irradiated upon a spherical hologramH made up of a plurality of partial holograms Hi to form a split progressive multi layer spherical light shell BSNK in evacuated vessels 7 and 8, and that two equal masses M are disposed on diametrically opposite positions and rotated in the same direction 28 at a speed v along a circular orbit 4 of a diameter D. The method of operating this apparatus is similar to that snown in Fig. 29. To rener the mass M to have an ultra high density it is necessary to make large the power for entrapping a particle group 26 in the split progressive multilayer spherical light shell BSNK.Such purpose can be accomplished b increasing the ar.plituze and number of oscillations of the electromagnetic wave used as has been pointed out t ecr. Fig. 37 shows a state in which two diametrically opposed equal masses M are rotated at a speed v in the same direction 28 along a circular orbit 4 of a diameter D by the crescent shaped split progressive multilayer light shell BSNK shown in Fig.30. As shown in Fig. 30, the crescent shaped split progressive multilayer light shell BSNK can compress the particle group 26 to an ultra high density and can rotate it along the cIrcular orbit at ultra high speed v. Regarding the compression of the particles to an ultra high density, some examples were published in United States of America and Germany, in 1984.In the embodiment shown in Fig. 37, the degree of compression is 1 10 of that of these examples. Rotation along the circular orbit at the ultra high speed v is effected in the following manner. With conventional particle accelerating apparatus, electrons are accelerated to 99 cf the light velocity even at 3,000,000 eVs. Where electrons are ac celebrated to higher speed, the mass of the particles would be increased according to the theorem of relativity. When electrons are accelerated to 300MeVs, the mass would be increased by 600 times. However, when particles having a large mass as protons are accelerated, even when the protons are accelerated to 300 MeVs, the increase in their masses is only about 30 . Because the mass of a proton is about 1800 times of an electron. To rotate particles at a speed near the light velocity v c c , the apparatus should be designed by taking into consideration the fact that the mass might be increased. By increasing the number of masses M rotating along the circular orbit 4, the number of oscillations of the discharged gravity wave can be increased. However, when the wave becomes a continuous doughnut shape which is symmetry to the axis, the gravity wave would not be discharged. Fig. 38A is a diagrammatic representation showing gravity wave generating apparatus having a transparent to diffractive light L spherical inner evacuated vessel 13 having a diameter of D. For example, where D 1.25 m its inner volume amounts 3 to about 1 m . When filled with fluid of a specific gravity of unity, the mass of the fluid becomes about 1,000 Kg. Then the reproducing light L is applied to the fluid for compression the same by the split progressive multilayer light shell BS . When heated, the liquid converts into gas plasma.Since the split progressive multilayer light shell BSNK also functions as a pump to entrap therein external substance, it is possIble to completely entrap the substance remaining on the outside. As above described, whole substance is entrapped, compressed to a smaller size, and then divided thereby forming a pair of crescent shaped divided progressive multilayer light shells BSNK as shown in Fig. 38B. In Fig. 38B, when the mass is divided into two equal parts, the mass of each part equals to 500 Kg. When the mass is compressed into a sphere of a diameter of 10 5 m, the density of the mass would become about 1 10 of the neutron density, thus satis frying te condition described above. This gravity wave generating device can also simultaneously effect the nuclear fusion reaction see embodiment 9 , thereby also acting as a nuclear fusion reactor. By passing a medium for taking out the nuclear fusion energy through a space 33 of a width d between the inner evacuated vessel 13 and the inner wall 8 of the outer evacuated vessel 7, the energy generated by the nuclear fusion reaction can be taken out. To this end, a method similar to embodiment 9 can be used. All particle accelerating apparatus described above can be realized by utilizing embodiment 8. B ut lizing embodiment 5, 6 or 7 such particle accelerating apparatus can also be provided. E... odiment 12 Method and apparatus for conveving a workpiece worked bv the holography working machine utilizing holography The inner evacuated working chamber of a holography working machine has been described with reference to embodiment 10. To move material gas entrapped in the internal evacuated working chamber 22 to respective working portions, that is positions at which crystallization occurs, embodiment 8 is utilized.The split progressive multilayer light shell BSNK according to embodiment 8 can entrap take in or take out the particle group 26. Accordingly, by the unique utilization of these performances, it is easy to convey the material gas to the position of crystallization. Fig. 39 is a sectional view of the holography working machine showing this state. A light shell 35 adapted to convey vaporized material 36 into the internal evacuated working chamber 22 can be realized by utilizing the method of embodiment 8. The light shell 35 can take in the vaporized materIal 36 and then convey it while changIng the quantity any densit thereof. As shown, the vaporized materIal 36 sut plied through a supply nozzle 14 into the inner evacuated working chamber 22 is entrapped into the shell 35 and conveyed to a desired position as shown by arrows 28.Not used vaporized material 36 is entrapped in the light shell 35 to be conveyed to a recovery nozzle 15. Light shells 35 can be freely generated, extinguished, integrated or separated.Thus the method of this embodiment can improve the performance of the holography working machine. The vaporized material conveying light shell 35 described above can be formed according to embodiment 8. The light shell can also be formed by utilizing embodiment 5, 6 or 7 but its performance is not so high as that formed by utilizing embodiment 8. Further the light shell can also be formed by utilizing two or more of the embodiments 5 through 8.Embodiment 13 A method and apparatus for effecting adiabatic expansion cooling of sub stance by utilizing holography technique Adiabatic expansion cooling of substance can be made by utilizing embodiment 4. The split progressive multilayer light shell BSNK according to embodiment 4 can compress the substance to an ultra high density.To compress the substance to an ultra high density it is necessary to increase the entrapping force of the lich shell. This is possible b increasing the number of oscillations and amplitude of the reproducing light used. Figs. 40a 40d show procedures of effecting the adiabatic expansion cooling of substance. Thus, Fig.40a shows a state of entrapping substance in the split progressive multI layer spherical light shellBSNK, while Fig. 40b shows a state in which the entrapped substance is compressed to a high density by the light shell BSNK. The substance 37 compressed to the high density radiates electromagnetic wave 9 to the outside as its energy due to temperature rise.When the energy of the radiate electromagnetic wave 9 is adjusted to exceed the energy caused by the heating by the holography or newly added other energy, the high density substance its .s energy. Then as shown in Fig. 4Cc, the spherical light shell BSNK is expanded for causing the high density substance 37 to expand rapidly while decreasing its pressure. Then the substance can be solidified by the cooling caused by adiabatic expansion. At the time of expansion, as it is possible to decrease the pressure applied by the spherical light shell BS, the heating by holography may be small. If the expansion speed 15 too fast, care should be taken to prevent explosive s attering of the substance. Where the expansion speed is gradually decreased to zero at the final stace, the spherical shape can be maintained. As above described, it is possible to solidify such vaporized material 36 as metal by cooling in an extremely short time. Tis is also true for substances other than metal. where a chemical reaction or a nuclear reaction accompanies, it is possible to execute adiabatic expansion by causing expansion after the energy generated by the reaction has been radiated as electromagnetic waves 9.Where the reaction continues to continuously generate energy, cooling is effected by a first stage expansion, and following the extinguishment of the reaction, the energy is dissipated by the radiation of the electromagnetic waves 9. After that, cooling is possible by a second stage adiabatic expansion. In fig. 40a 40d, although the light shell was shown as a sphere, it will be clear that it can take any other configuration. Above description concerns the cooling of substance by utilizing embodiment 4 without moving the center of gravity P of the substance but where the embodiment g is used cooling can be effected while moving the center of gravity of the substance. Figs. 41a 41d show successive steps of cool ing of substance 5 adiabatic expansion by utilizing e nbodirent 8 wherein the movement of the center o gravity P0 P3 is free.More particularly, Fig. 41a snows a state in which a low density substance 36 is entrapped in a movable split progressive multi layer spherical light shell BSNK, while Fig. 41b shows a state in which the substance is compressed to a high density by the light shell BSNK and t energy is radiated as electromagnetic waves 9. Fis. 41c shows a state In which the light shell BSNK is deformed into a movable split progressive multi layer light shell BSNK for effecting adiabatic expansion while deforming the substance, whereas Fig. 41d shows a state in which the substance is cooled to solidify as shown by reference character 39.In this case, since the method of embodiment 8 is utilized in Fig.41a 41d, the position of the center of gravitiesP0 P3 can be changed as desired in a definite range. The method of the adiabatic expansion cooling just described can be applied to the conversion of from gas to liquid, from gas to solid or from liauia to solid. This method is also applicable to the conversion of from gas to gas, from liquid to licuid or from solid to solid. Above described method utilizing embodiment 4 can also be carried out by using embodiment 1, 2 or 3 although the efficiency decreases more or ess. Above described method utilizing embodimen b also be carried out by using embodiment 5, 6 or although the efficiency also decreases siIhty. The methods described above can be used for cooling material in a holography working machine. The basic principle of the holography working machine lies in that a high te eratre space and a low temperature space are formed in a three dimensional space, and that a fact is utilized wherein the material in the low temperature space sublimates and then solidifies. In Fig. 39, cooling was effected by the heat conduction from the cooling pedestal 16. In contrast, the method utilizing embodiment 13 may be considered a method in which a heating space is converted into a cooling space. The method shown in Figs. 40a 40d and Figs. 41a 41d can be considered to constitute a type of the holography working machine. Where a split progressive multilayer light shell BSNK emanating strong electromagnetic wave is used, solid substance can be deformed to have any desired configuration. In Fig. 40a where solid substance is entrapped in the light shell instead of gas, the substance can be converted into the state shown in Fig.40b by heating and compressing the substance with the energy of the reproducing light. Subsequent proceaures are similar to those shown In Fig. 41a 41C. Some examples of the m,ach ninc wili be describe as follows. Figs. 42a 42c show steps of manufacturing E cup shaped vessel 39. Fig. 42a show a state in which high density substance 37 compressed by a split progressive multilayer light shell BSNK is radiating electromagnetic waves 9. Fig. 42b shows a state in which the light shell BSNK is expanded to cool the material 38 by the adiabatic expansion which expands the material in the direction of arrow 40. Fig. 42c shows a state in which the light shell is completely expanded so as to convert the substance into a solid body 39 and then the light shell BSNK is extinguished.In a cup shaped body wherein the light shell BSNK can be focused from outside the workpiece can be worked with a single step. However, in the case of a more complicated topological configuration, a method of laminating tomograms disclosed in the specification of the patent application regarding the holography working machine cited above can be relied upon. Fig. 43 diagrammatically shows the principle of the method of tomogram lamination. According to this method a product 19 is completed by continuously forming and laminating tomograms 20 of the material having a thickness Az and undergoing crystallization. Accordingly, where an image of a hologram is focused on the tomogram 20 undergoing crystllization, it is possible to manufacture the product 19. Hence it is possible to manufacture a hollow and complicated body as shown in Fig. 44a. Fig. 44b shows an eternal view of the completed body 19, in which dotted lines show internal cavities 42. The tomogram lamination can be formed as follows by utilizing the adiabatic cooling method according to embodiment 13. Figs. 45a and 45b show one example thereof.Fig. 45a shows a method of preparing solid body 39 by the steps of compressing raw material substance 37 to a high density by means of a split progressive multilayer light shell BSNK thereby radiating electromagnetic waves 9, moving the high density substance to the position of the tomogram 20 undergoing crystallization, and expanding the light shellBSNK at a predetermined position so as to expand the internal high density material 37, thereby cocling the same by adiabatic expansion to form the solid bod 39. Fig. 45b shows a state in which the high densIty material 37 is solidified to make it integral with an already solidified portion 19. Figs. 46a and 46b are partially enlarged views of the tomogram 20 shown in Fig. 45. After positioning material units 37 of high density at predetermined positions of the tomogram 20 by light shells, the trial is caused to expand along equiexpansion lanes 4 as shown in Fig. 46a. is is made for the purpose of preventing already solidified portions 19 r being deformed or melted 5 the high temperature and high pressure substance 37. To accomplish this, the following three considerations are essential. 1 At the time of connecting the high density material 37 to the already solidified portion 19, a control should be made such that solidified bodies 39 are formed by the cooling caused by adiabatic expansion. In other words, it is necessary to cause solidification concurrently with the connection so as to stably maintain the already solidified portion 19 without deformation and melting. 2 The equal expansion lines 43 should be formed such that images focused by holography can be made satisfactory. 3 The equiexpansion lines 43 or the direction of application cf pressure 44 should be parallel as far as possible with the already solidified portions 19 as shown in Fig. 46a so that the light shell BSNK would not apply pressure to the already solidified portions. This is possible by raising the equiexpan sion lines 43 while sequentially solidifying the material 37 at portions near already solidified portions 19. In this manner, as shown in Fig. 46b, by forming solid substances 39 it is possible to connect and integrate tomograms 2C having a thickness Az to already solidified portion 19. Figs. 47a and 47b show a method efficient to a case wherein the thickness z is extreme ysra ani. high working accuracies are not necessary. High density material formed by the split progressive multilayer light shell BSNK at the center of the space 45 expected to be solidified is rapidly expanded adiabatically while controlling speed by the light shell BSNK . At the final stage of expansion, adjacent units 45 are pressed together or pressed against already solidified portion 19 to form an integral body. At this time for the purpose of preventing deformation of the configurations of the units 45 and the already solidified portion 19, the equiexpansion line 43, the expansion speed toward the direction of arrow 40 and the density and temperature of the high density material 37 are controlled. Figs. 48a and 48b show a method of growing crystals by taking out, part after part, the high density material 37 entrapped in a split progressive multilayer light shell BSNK and then causing the material 37 to undergo adiabatic expansion. According to this method extremely precise working is possible. In a first case, as shown by an arrow 38 , the high density material 37 is derived out as low density gas, while in a second case, the material 37 15 derive out in a state having a density close te solid body. In the first case, the speed of manu f acturin is low, and the method corresponds to the method shown in Fig. 39 according to embodiment 12 which is carried out in more miniaturized scale.In the second case, while deriving out the material 37 in a direction of arrow 38 , the material is solidi fied as at 19 when the density of the gas decreases to that of a solid body. Where the temperature and pressure are not so high, the following method is possible. Figs. 49a and 49b show a case wherein a tomogram 39 previously designated by 20 is expanded adiabatically at a time.This is possible because the temperature and pressure are not too high so that already solidified portion 19 would not be deformed. Fig. 49a shows a state wherein the high density material 37 is formed at a position of a thickness Az to cause the material to expand adiabatically in a direction of 40. Fig. 49b shows a state in which solidified material 39 has been integrated with previously solidified portion. As above described this embodiment renders the holography working machine to be much higher dimensional machine, so that such machine is termed an adiabatic expansion holography working machine . The method of holography working machine utiliz ng adiabatic expansion cooling described above can be realized by using the embodiment 4 or 8. Then method can also be practices DV us inc the embodiment 1, 2 or 3 although the effciency is lower than that utilizing embodiment 4. It is also possible to utilize embodiment 5, 6 or 7 although the efficiency decreases than a case utilizing embodiment 8. According to this invention it is possible to realize a nuclear fusion reactor of high utility which cannot be realized according to the prior art method, a nuclear fission reactor, an inside evacuated working chamber 22 of a holography working machine, a method of conveying material gas 36 to a working portion in the working chamber, particle accelerating apparatus which is important to high energy physics, gravity wave generating apparatus which is an application of the particle accelerating apparatus, adiabatic expansion cooling apparatus, an adiabatic expansion holography woring machine and other various useful industrial apparatus.
