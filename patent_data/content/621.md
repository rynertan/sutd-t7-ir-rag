# Liquid dielectric composition.

## Abstract
A liquid dielectric composition obtained as a result of a process which comprises reacting benzene with ethylene in the presence of an alkylation catalyst to obtain an alkylation product containing largely unreacted benzene, ethylbenzene, polyethylbenzenes and heavier products, separating benzene, ethylbenzene and polyethylbenzenes from said alkylation product and thereafter recovering from said heavier products by distillation in the presence of a basic material a fraction having a boiling point in the temperature range of about 255 to about 420 C., preferably about 265 to about 400 C., most preferably about 275 to about 400 C., as said dielectric composition.
