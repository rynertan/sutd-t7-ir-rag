# Separator for separating oil and gas.

## Abstract
A separator suitable for separating a crude oil feed containing gas into gas and liquid the separator comprising a vessel 4 having an inlet 6 for feed dispos ed so that feed introduced under a pressure gradient is caused to form a downwardly flowing vortex of liquid from which an upwardly flowing vortex of gas separates, an up per outlet 10 for the vortex of gas comprising a pipe 8 extending downardly into the vessel from the top thereof, a lower outlet 16 for the liquid, the vessel further having located therein below the inlet 6 a downwardly extending hollow truncated cone 12 or cylinder to provide a surface for the downwardly flowing vortex of liquid, the walls 7 of the vessel 4 being spaced apart from the cone to provide therebetween a disengaging chamber 15 and an outlet 20 for the discharge of gas from the disengaging cham ber.
