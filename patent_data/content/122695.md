# Immunoassay for antigens employing supported binder.

## Abstract
A reagent kit for assay with enhance sensitivity of a hap ten or antigen analyte comprises a an antibody component with labelling, the material being either 1 antibody for the analyte, the antibody being labelled, or 2 antibody for the analyte, and a tracer comprising a labelled form of the ana lyte and b a binder for the antibody supported on a solid support, the binder being an antigen or a hapten. Incubation of an analyte with the component a and contacting with the component b is followed by determination of the labelling in the bound material or the unbound material.
