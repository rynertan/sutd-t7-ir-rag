The method comprises the steps of pre forming a liner 1 , an insole 3 , an upper and a sole, and applying to them, where necessary, a bonding substance of the type which does not initially avail itself of adhesive properties but which is sub sequently activable to assume curable, adhesive properties. Thereafter the liner 1 is placed on a support 12 , an insole 3 mounted on the liner 1 , the upper is then placed over the in sole and liner, and finally the sole mounted on the upper. The thus assembled footwear item is then subjected to treatment for activating and curing the bonding substance to produce a finished item of footwear.
