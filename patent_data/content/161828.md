# Inorganic fiber reinforced metallic composite material.

## Abstract
An inorganic fiber reinforced metallic composite material comprising a matrix of a metal or alloy and inorganic fibers as a reinforcing material, characterized in that a the inorganic fibers are inorganic fibers containing silicon, either titanium or zirconium, carbon and oxygen and composed of i an amorphous material consisting substantially of Si, M, C and O, or ii an aggregate consisting substantially of ultrafine crystalline particles with a particle diameter of not more than 50 nm of β SiC, MC, a solid solution of β SiC and MC and MC
