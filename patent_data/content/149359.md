In the present invention it has been found that the incorporation of specified amounts of the following type of monomer EMI2.1 in the synthesis of polyarylethersulfone I .produces a polymer which is suitable for being molded into circuit board substrates. When metal is electroplated onto such circuit board substrates there is a high degree of adhesion of the metal to the circuit board substrate. This invention is directed to a polymer useful for molding into a circuit board substrate.which polymer comprises a selected polyarylethersulfone. This invention is also directed to a circuit board substrate molded from such a polyarylethersulfone. The polyarylethersulfone of this invention is an amorphous thermoplastic polymer containing units of the formula EMI3.1 and wherein R is independently hydrogen, C1 to C6 alkyl or C4 to C8 cycloalkyl. a is an integer of o to 4 and n is independently an integer of 1 to 3 and wherein the ratio of unit III to unit IV is greater than 1. The units are attached to each other by an . O bond. The polyarylethersulfone contains from about 10 to about 75. and preferably from about 20 to about 65 mole percent of unit IV .said mole percent based on the total dihydroxy starting material. The polymer may additionally contain the following unit EMI3.2 wherein R is as defined above. µ is independentlyEMI4.1 wherein R1 and R2 hydrogen or C1 to C9 alkylEMI4.2 independently wherein R3 andR4 are i alkyl aEMI4.3 ndependently hydrogen or C1 to C8 nd a1 is an integer of 2 to 7 S , 0 , a and n are as defined above.A preferred polymer of this invention contains units of the formula EMI4.4 and These units are attached to each other by an 0 bond. The polyarylethersulfone may be random or may have an ordered structure. The polyarylethersulfones of this invention have a reduced viscosity of from about 0.4 to greater than about 2.5, as measured in N methylpyrrolidone. or other suitable solvent. at 25 C. The polyarylethersulfones of this invention are prepared by reacting the monomers represented by the following formulae EMI5.1 wherein R, a, X and n are as previously defined.and X and Y are independently selected from Cl. Br.F, NO2 or OH and at least 50 percent of the Y s are OH. The ratio of the concentration of OH groups to C1, Br. F and or NO groups used to form the polyarylethersulfone is from about 0.90 to about 1.10, preferably from about 0.98 to about 1.02. The monomers. represented by formulas VI , VII , VIII . and IX include the following 4.41 dihydroxydiphenyl sulfone. 2,4 dihydroxydiphenyl sulfone. 4,4 dichlorodiphenyl sulfone. 4,4 dinitrodiphenyl sulfone. 4 chloro 4 hydroxydiphenyl sulfone, 2.2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl profane, 4.4 biphenol, hydroquinone. resorcinol, and the like. The preferred monomers include hydroquinone, 4,4 biphenol, 4,4 dichlorodiphenyl sulfone. and 4,4 dihydroxydiphenyl sulfone, or 4 chloro 4 hydroxydiphenyl sulfone. The polymers of this invention are prepared by contacting substantially equimolar amounts of the hydroxy containing compounds depicted in formulas VI to IX supra and halo and or nitro containing compounds depicted in formula VI and VII supra with from about 0.5 to about 1.0 mole of an alkali metal carbonate per mole of hydroxyl group in a solvent mixture comprising a solvent which forms an azeotrope with water in order to maintain the reaction medium at substantially anhydrous conditions during the polymerization. The temperature of the reaction mixture is kept at from about 120 to about 1800C, for about l to about 5 hours and then raised and kept at from about 200 to about 250 C. preferably from about 210 to about 230 C. for about 1 to 10 hours. The reaction is carried out in an inert atmosphere. e.g.. nitrogen. at atmospheric pressure.although higher or lower pressures may also be used. The polyarylethersulfone is then recovered by conventional techniques such as coagulation.solvent evaporation, and the like. The solvent mixture comprises a solvent which forms an azeotrope with water and a polar aprotic solvent. The solvent which forms an azeotrope with water includes an aromatic hydrocarbon such as benzene. toluene, xylene. ethylbenzene, chlorobenzene, and the like. The polar aprotic solvents employed in this invention are those generally known in the art for the manufacture of polyarylether sulfones and include sulfur containing solvents such as those of the formula s S OHb R5 in which each R5 represents a monovalent lower hydrocarbon group free of aliphatic unsaturation, which preferably contains less than about 8 carbon atoms or when connected together represents a divalent alkylene group with b being an integer from 1 to 2 inclusive. Thus. in all of these solvents all oxygens and two carbon atoms are bonded to the sulfur atom. Contemplated for use in this invention are such solvents as those having the formula EMI7.1 where the R6 groups are independently lower alkyl.such as methyl, ethyl, propyl. butyl, and like groups, and aryl groups such as phenyl and alkylphenyl groups such as the tolyl group, as well as those where the R6 groups are interconnected as in a divalent alkylene bridge such as EMI7.2 in tetrahydrothiophene oxides and dioxides.Specifically, these solvents include dimethylsulfoxide, dimethylgulfone, diphenylsulfone. diethylsulfoxide, diethylsulfone, diisopropylsulfonc, tetrahydrothiophene l,l dioxide commonly called tetramethylene sulfone or sulfolane and tetrahydrothiophene l monoxide. Additionally, nitrogen containing solvents may be used. These include dimethylacetamide. dimethylformamide and N methylpyrrolidone. The azeotrope forming solvent and polar aprotic solvent are used in a weight ratio of from about 1 10 to about 1 1, preferably from about 1 5 to about 1 3. In the reaction. the hydroxy containing compound is slowly converted, in situ, to the alkali salt thereof by reacting with the alkali metal carbonate. The alkali metal carbonate is preferably potassium carbonate. Mixtures of carbonates such as potassium and sodium carbonate may also be used. Water is continuously removed from the reaction mass as an azeotrope with the azeotrope forming solvent so that substantially anhydrous conditions are maintained during the polymerization. It is essential that the reaction medium be maintained substantially anhydrous during the polycondensation. While amounts of water up to about one percent can be tolerated, and are somewhat beneficial when employed with fluorinated dihalobenzenoid compounds, amounts of water substantially greater than this are desirably avoided as the reaction of water with the halo and or nitro compound leads to formation of phenolic species and only low molecular weight products are secured. Consequently, in order to secure the high polymers. the system should be substantially anhydrous. and preferably contain less than 0.5 percent by weight water during the reaction. Preferably, after the desired molecular weight has been attained, the polymer is treated with an activated aromatic halide or an aliphatic halide such as methyl chloride or benzyl chloride.and the like. Such treatment of the polymer converts the terminal hydroxyl groups into ether groups which stabilize the polymer. The polymer so treated has good melt and oxidative stability. The polyarylethersulfone polymer may be used with other ingredients such as stabilizers, i.e., metal oxides such as zinc oxide. antioxidants. flame retardants, pigments, and the like. The polymer may be used with reinforcing fibers and or inorganic fillers. The reinforcing fiber includes fiberglass, carbon fibers, and the like. and mixtures thereof. The particulate inorganic fillers which may be used include vollastonite, calcium carbonate, glass beads, talc. mica and the like. or mixtures thereof. The fiber reinforcement. filler or combinations thereof, is utilized in amounts of fromO to about 50 weight percent. preferably from about 10 to about 35 weight percent. The polyarylethersulfone polymer in combination with the other ingredient is prepared by any conventional mixing methods. For example, polyarylethersulfone and other optional ingredients in powder or granular form are blended in an extruder and the mixture extruded into strands and the strands are chopped into pellets. The pellets are molded into the desired circuit board substrate by conventional techniques. EXAMPLES The following examples serve to give specific illustrations of the practice of this invention but they are not intended in any way to limit the scope of this invention. Control A A polymer having the following repeat unit was used EMI10.1 The polymer has a reduced viscosity of 0.5 dl g as measured in N methylpyrrolidone at 25eC. Example 1 A four neck 1000 ml round bottom flask was equipped with a mechanical stirrer, thermometer.addition funnel, dry nitrogen inlet. and vacuum jacketed vigreux column with a distillate collector and condenser. Into the flask were charged 143.58 g 0.50 moles of 4,4 dichlorodiphenyl sulfone. 112.62 g t0 45 moles of 4 dihyroxydiphenyl sulfone, 5.51 g 0.05 moles of hydroquinone. 76.02 g 0.55 moles of potassium carbonate, 150 g of monochlorobenzene and 460 g of sulfolane. The mixture was purged with nitrogen for 1 hour at room temperature and then heated to reflux 1500C . After 1 hour at reflux, the temperature of the reaction was increased to about 2350C by slowly removing the monochlorobenzene. After about 5 hours at 235 C, the reaction was diluted with monochlorobenzene and terminated by adding methyl chloride. The polymer so produced was recovered by coagulation in methanol followed by washing the polymer several times with hot water 800C . A theoretical yield of the polymer was obtained. The polymer had a reduced viscosity of 0.61 dl g as measured in N methylpyrrolidone 0.2 g 100 ml at 250C.

Preuaration of substrates Substrates were molded from the Examples and Controls in a 4x4x0.125 inch cavity mold. The mold was placed between the heated platins of aSouth Bend hydraulic press at 300 C. After forming under pressure to produce a plaque. the mold was cooled slowly over a period of about five minutes to room temperature. The substrates were immersed in an aqueous solution containing 30 concentration by volume of 1.3 dichloro 2 propanol for 90 seconds at 1000F. This constituted the pre etch.The substrates were then rinsed 5 min 30µc and immersed in an etch which was a chromic acid solution of the following composition 96 H2SO4 4 55.9 weight 87 H3PO4 10.4 weight Cr03 3.0 weight H20 30.7 weight S Etching was accomplished in 10 minutes at l 8 F. Following treatment, the surface of the substrate was made catalytic to a conventional electroless copper solution by immersion in a solution containing stannous chloride and palladium chloride. The substrate was then immersed in the autocatalytic electroless copper solution containing a chelating agent for cupric ion, a pH regulator and a reducing agent for cupric ion. After a thin copper coat appeared on the substrate, the substrate was electroplated to a thickness of about 2 mils. Following electroplating, the specimens were allowed to equilabrate for 72 hours in a vacuum oven at 1200F. Electroplate adhesion was then evaluated by the peel strength test. The peel strength was determined by pulling a one inch wide strip of metal from the substrate at a rate of 0.2 min and an angle of 904 using anInstron Universal Testing Machine. The results are shown in the Table.
