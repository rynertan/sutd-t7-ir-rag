# Electron beam lithograph proximity correction method.

## Abstract
Proximity effect is reduced or eliminated by breaking each shape of a lithographic exposure pattern into two parts, a perimeter part having a width on the order of the lithographic exposure pattern minimum linewidth and the remaining central part or parts if any which are completely surrounded by the perimeter part. Figure 2 shows the edge parts hatched and the centre part blank. The lithographic exposure pattern is then modified by moving or setting back the edges of each central part away from the perimeter part which surrounds it similar to reducing the size of the central part to form a nominally unexposed band separating each central part from the perimeter part which surrounds it. This is shown in Fig. 3. The width of the nominally unexposed band in the modi fied exposure pattern is preferably chosen as large as pos sible so long as the condition is met that upon developing a radiation sensitive layer directly exposed to the modified exposure pattern, the nominally unexposed band develops i.e., dissolves, resists dissolution, or is otherwise modified substantially as if it were also exposed. The nominally unex posed band is exposed, in fact, by electrons scattered from the directly exposed part s of the shape the perimeter part plus the central part, if any . The width of the nominally unexposed band is preferably about twice the edge bias applied to outside edges of each shape.
