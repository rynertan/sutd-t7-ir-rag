# Charge receptor film for charge transfer imaging.

## Abstract
A charge receptor film element 11 for charge transfer imaging comprising, in order, a support, e.g., transparent film, b conductive layer, e.g., metal, metal oxide, ammonium chloride salt, c thin dielectric layer bearing, e.g., transparent polyethylene terephthalate, d opaque dots 20 , e.g., 3 to 50 micrometers in height, covering less than 10 of the total area of layer c which provide less than 0.05 background optical density. The element is useful for medical radiography, in electrophotography, electrostatic printing, etc.
