## Description
The present invention relates to a network for reducing distortion in the modulation of the output signal of a voltage controlled oscillator in accordance with the precharacterizing part of claim 1. Distortion in the modulation of a voltage controlled oscillator VCO is a well known problem. Frequently, a non linear shaping function is employed to shape the modulating signal of a VCO for reducing distortion in the frequency modulation FM component of the output signal of the VCO. The network according to the precharacterizing part of claim 1 is shown in Fig. 1 and utilizes a diode resistor network, the resistors of which are typically selected for reduced distortion in VCO output which is time consuming and expensive. Distortion specifications for VCO s which employ such a network, range from about 29 dB to about 54 dB. In another prior art shaping network shown in Fig. 2, the V FR A 1 307 700 see Fig. 9 discloses a network for reducing distortion in the modulation of the output signal of a voltage controlled tank circuit, said network being arranged for shaping the modulation signal of the voltage controlled tank circuit and comprises a voltage divider which includes a semiconductor device employed as one of the resistive elements of the divider. The semiconductor device of this known circuit is a bipolar transistor having an exponential transfer characteristic similar to the charge discharge characteristics of a typical capacitor. In fact, the transistor is used in place of a capacitor to produce a desired exponential voltage. The object of the present invention is to provide a network for reducing distortion in the modulation of the output signal of a voltage controlled oscillator, which network can significantly reduce the FM distortion in the output signal of a voltage controlled oscillator. The above object is solved by a network for reducing distortion in the modulation of the output signal of a voltage controlled oscillator, said network comprising a voltage divider coupled to the voltage controlled oscillator for shaping its modulating signal, the network having a characteristic transfer function. According to the invention Claim 1 this network is characterized in that said voltage divider includes as one of its resistive elements a field effect transistor biased for unsaturated non linear operation for providing a controllable non linear resistance, said field effect transistor being coupled in parallel to the input path of said network and introducing a controlled amount of second order non linearity to said characteristic transfer function which is given by the relation where R The above object is also solved by a network for reducing distortion in the modulation of the output signal of a voltage controlled oscillator, said network comprising a voltage divider coupled to the voltage controlled oscillator for shaping its modulating signal, the network having a characteristic transfer function. According to the invention Claim 2 network is characterized in that said voltage divider includes as one of its resistive elements a field effect transistor biased for unsaturated non linear operation for providing a controllable non linear resistance, said field effect transistor being coupled in series to the input path of said network and introducing a controlled amount of second order non linearity to said characteristic transfer function which is given by the relation where R According to preferred embodiment a voltage amplifier having a predetermined gain is coupled between the voltage divider network and the voltage controlled oscillator for amplifying the shaped modulating signal. According to further preferred embodiment a summing circuit is coupled between the voltage divider network and the voltage controlled oscillator for summing the shaped modulating signal with an oscillator tuning voltage. A pre distortion shaping network constructed according to the principles of the present invention provides a second order voltage transfer function, the first and second order coefficients of which may be independently selected. The non linearity of that voltage transfer function is approximately equal to the inverse of the VCO frequency modulation transfer function non linearity. The shaping network of the present invention provides at least 30 dB improvement in VCO FM distortion. Typically, 90 dB distortion is obtainable. There now follows a detailed description which is to be read with reference to Figures 3 to 7 of the accompanying drawings of networks according to the invention it is to be clearly understood that these networks have been selected for description to illustrate the invention by way of example and not by way of limitation. In the accompanying drawings An analysis of the non linear shaping function required by a typical VCO to produce substantially distortion free FM output signals, shows that the predistortion shaping required is predominantly second order and is given by the following relation The derivation of equation A is given in Appendix A to this specification. The analysis is not necessary to understand the operation of the FET shaping network of the present invention, but is required to design such a shaping network for a particular VCO. The transfer function of the FET shaping network of the present invention is given by the relation Where R The derivation of equation B is given in Appendix B to this specification. The transfer function of the FET shaping network 33 as shown in Figs. 3B and 3D of the present invention is given by the relation The derivation of equation C is given in Appendix C to this specification. The close match between equations A and B and equations A and C indicate that a shaping network according to the present invention very closely approximates the shaping required to linearize the output FM modulation of the VCO signal. A comparison of equations A and B also shows the improvement of the present invention over traditional prior art diode resistor shaping network. Such networks provide a transfer function comprised of interconnected straight line segments having brake points at the interconnection which approximate the desired curve. The more break points, the better the approximation, and many such break points are required to suppress higher order terms of the transfer function which are also produced by the network. The FET shaping network provides a transfer function having no break points and is inherently low in higher order terms. The shaping networks 30,33 of Fig. 3A 3D are resistive voltage dividers in which a semiconductor device 32, namely an FET, is employed as one of the two resistances in the divider. Two basic configurations of the divider are provided the dividers 30 in Fig. 3A and 3C are the same as each other but different from the dividers 33 in Fig. 3B and 3D. Such networks are utilized to shape the modulating signal of a VCO to reduce distortion in the FM component of the output signal of a VCO. A shaping network according to the present invention attenuate its input voltage because it is a voltage divider. However, often it is desirable to have a sharper circuit with at least unity gain. Such gain may be achieved by amplifying the output signal from the divider network as shown in Fig. 3A and 3B, or by scaling the input signal to the divider network as shown in Fig. 3C and 3D. The shaping networks according to the present invention and shown in Fig. 3A to 3D to introduce a controlled amount of second order non linearity to the voltage divider transfer function whereby the second order term opposes the first order linear term. It should be noted that, if desirable, the sign of the second order term may be changed by interchanging the source and drain connections in the configuration shown or by using a p channel FET. Referring again to Fig. 3A 3D, if g v is the transfer function of the resistive dividers 30 and 33, and A is the gain of the amplifiers 35 and 36, then for amplifier 35A and 36A, where and for amplifier 35B and 36B There are several constraints on the shaping networks of the present invention. The first is This constraint is necessary to satisfy the assumption underlying the series expansions of Appendix A. This is a necessary condition for calculation of the drain current of the FET in the unsaturated region. If V This implies that V
