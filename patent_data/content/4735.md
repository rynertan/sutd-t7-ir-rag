# Antibiotics designated as BM 782 alpha 1, BM 782 alpha 2 and BM 782 alpha 1a, process for their preparation and pharmaceutical compositions containing them.

## Abstract
This invention relates to three new antibiotics which are designated BM782 alpha 1, BM782 alpha 2, and BM782 alpha 1a, respectively, and which are produced in a microbiological fermentation under controlled conditions using a new strain of an undetermined species of the genus Nocardia or mutants thereof. These new antibacterial agents are active against Mycobacterium tuberculosis as well as both gram positive and gram negative microorganisms and thus are potentially useful for inhibiting the growth of such bacteria and bacilli.

## Description
Title antibiotics BM782 alpha 1, BM782 alpha 2 and BM782 alpha 1a This invention relates to new antibiotics, designated BM782 alpha 1, M782 2 and FM782oL1a, to a process for their preparation and to pharmaceutical compositions containing them. The novel antibiotics of the present invention are characterised by the physical characteristics of their essentially pure amorphous sulfate forms, as follows Antibiotic BM782 alpha 1 as essentially pure amorphous sulfate form a has the following elemental analysis percent C, 31.79 H, 6.18 N, 12.48 S, 7.40 b has an optical rotation Lazy 2 Oo C 0.48 in water c has an infrared absorption spectrum as shown in Figure 1 of the drawings, d has a characteristic 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum as shown in Figure 2 of the drawings and e has a characteristic proton magnetic resonance spectrum as shown in Figure 3 of the drawings. Antibiotic BM782 alpha 2 as essentially pure amorphous sulfate form a has the following elemental analysis percent C, 31.31 H, 6.16 N, 12.05 S, 7.31 b has an optical rotation alpha D20 0 C 0.68 in water c has an infrared absorption spectrum as shown in Figure 4 of the drawings, d has a characteristic 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum as shown in Figure 5 of the drawings and e has a characteristic proton magnetic resonance spectrum as shown in Figure 6 of the drawings. Antibiotic BM782 alpha 1a as essentially pure amorphous sulfate form a has the following elemental analysis percent C, 30.18 H, G.16 N, 11.76 S, B.61 b has an optical rotation alpha D20 4 2 C 0.653 in water c has an infrared absorption spectrum as shown in Figure 7 of the drawings d has a characteristic 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum as shown in Figure 8 of the drawings and e has a characteristic proton nagnetic resonance spectrum as shown in Figure 9 of the drawings The novel antibiotics of the present invention are organic bases and thus are capable of forming acid addition salts with a variety of organic and inorganic salt forming reagents.The structure of these antibiotics has now been postulated as follows EMI2.1 The structure is depicted in the free base form, in a convention which omits showing the acid addition salt. These antibiotics are suitably obtained in the hydrated sulfate salt form, as shown in the RYnmrles below. Other acid addition salts can be formed by suitable procedures such as with ion exchange resins with such acids as phosphoric, hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfamic, citric, maleic, fumaric, tartaric, acetic, benzoic, gluconic, ascorbic, and related acids. The acid addition salts of the antibacterial agents of the present invention are, in general, solids very soluble in water, slightly soluble in methanol and ethanol but relatively insoluble in non polar organic solvents such as diethyl ether, benzene and toluene.For purposes of this invention, the antibacterial free bases are equivalent to their non toxic acidaddition salts. The new antibiotics which we have designated BM782u11, BM782cn2, and BM782 a1a are formed during the cultivation under controlled conditions of a new strain of an undetermined species ofNocardia. This new antibiotic producing strain is a mutant derived by gamma radiation of a spore suspension of the parent culture which was isolated from a soil sample collected in Australia. A viable culture of the new microorganism has been deposited with the CultureCollection Laboratory, Northern Regional Research Center, U.S.Dept. of Agriculture, Peoria, Illinois under its accession number NRRL 11,239. Another viable culture of the new microorganism was deposited with the American Type Culture Collection of 12301 ParklawnDrive, Rockville, Maryland 20852, U.S.A., on l3thMarch, 1979 and given the accession number ATOC 31497 The following is a general description of the microorganismNocardia sp. NRRL 11,239 ATCC 31497 based on diagnostic characteristics observed. Observations were made of the cultural, physiological and morphological features of the organism in accordance with the methods detailed by Shirling and Gottlieb,Internat. Journ. of Syst. Bacteriol. 16, 313 340 1966 . The chemical composition of the culture was determined by established procedures.The underscored descriptive colours and colour chip designations were taken from Jacobson et al., Color Harmony Manual, 3rd Edition 1948 , Container Corp. of America, Chicago, Illinois.Descriptive details are recorded in Tables I to V below. Becker et al., Appl. Microbiol. 12, 421 423 1964 Lechevalier, J. Lab. Clin. Med. 71, 934 944 1968 . Amount of Growth Moderate on all media studied except on inorganic salts starch agar where it was light, and very light on,ozapek s solution agar.Aerial Mycelium Yellowish to yellowish white, becoming tight Ivory 2ca toPearl Pink 3ca to Bisque 3ec in sporulating zones,Soluble Pigments Light to moderate in yellowish to yellowish brown shades.Reverse Colour In yellowish brown to brownish shades.Miscellaneous Physiological Reactions Complete liquefaction of gelatin nirate reduced to nitrites in 7 days no melanin pigments fobbed on peptone iron agar complete peptonization in purple milk in 14 days NaCl tolerance in yeast extract agar 4 but 7 . Carbon source utilization patterns were determined in Czapek s solution agar, instead of the usualPridham and Cottlieb J. Bacteriol., 56, 107 iX4 1948 3 medium which did not support growth.Results are as follows Good utilization of d galactose, glycerol, d mannose, maltose, sucrose, d trehalose and dextrose poor to non utilization of adonitrol, 1 arabinose, d fructose, i inositol, lactose, d mannitol, d melezitose, d raffinose and d xylose. Chemical Composition Cell wall and sugar analysis demonstrated that the culture contained meso 2, 6 diaminopimelic acid and major amounts of galactose typical of cell wall type IV lechevalier vide supra however, atypically, no arabinose was found. Micromorphol ogy Aerial mycelium shows varying degrees of segmentation terminal portions tend to form tangled, branching chains of spore like elements which disarticulate readily. Spores are globose to elliptical. Spore sheaths dehisce and sheath fragments frequently cling to spores. spores are 0.3 0.4 M x 0.5 0.6 M. Spore surfaces are smooth as determined by transmission electron microscopy at 20,OOOX. On the basis of the general characteristics observed, culture NRRL 11,239 AICC 31497 appears morphologically to be a representative of the genus Nocardia, i.e. it has the usual segmentation and fragmentation of mycelium and the long chains of disarticulating coccoid spore like elements. Also, in keeping with the Nocardia concept it shows fastidious utilization of carbon sources and preference for nitrates. Although the organism was atypical in its ladk of arabinose in whole cell hydrolyzates, this situation is also approached by other Nocardia species CPridham andLyons, Devlpmt. Indus. Microbiol., 10, 183 221 1969 . According to the McClung system for identification ofNocardia species Buchanan and Gibbons, Bergey s Manual ofDeterminative Bacteriology, 8th Edition, Williams and Wilkins Co.,Baltimore, Md. l974 , the culture appears to belong in MorphologicalGroup III however, it was not readily placed in any of the species categories. Therefore, it is considered an undetermined species of the genus Nocardia. TABLE ICultural Characteristics of Nocardia sp.

These new antibacterials are thereby potentially useful as therapeutic agents for treating bacterial and tubercular infections in mammals. These new agents can be expected to be usefully employed for treating or controlling such infections by parenteral administration. The usefulness of these new antibacterial agents is demonstrated by their ability to control systemic lethal infections in mice.The animals used were CharlesRiver CD 1 strain female mice, approximately 6 weeks old and averaging 20 2 grams in weight. Infections were produced by intraperitoneal injections of a 0.5 ml. volume lethal dose of a trypticase soy broth TSB dilution of a 5 hour TSB blood culture of the microorganisms listed in Table VII below.

The results are set forth inTable VIII as survival ratio alive total at 7 days post infection. The potential usefulness of these new agents as anti tubercular drugs is demonstrated by their ability to control tubercular infections in mice. This was demonstrated by the following procedure Carworth Farms CEl female white mice, 4 to 6 weeks old, weighing 17 to 22 grams are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosisH37Rv by intravenous administration of 0.2 ml. of a buffered saline suspension containing approximately 1.5 mg. ml. wet weight of a 12 to 14 day culture of the test organism grown on Sauton s agar medium.The mice are then segregated in a random manner into cages, each of which holds 2, 5 or 10 mice. Four groups of 5 mice each are retained as infected, untreated controls. The remaining mice are used to determine the activity of the test compounds. The test compounds are administered subcutaneously in 1 2 ml. aqueous doses at various concentrations in a total of 8 injections spread over 10 days. A compound is considered active if it either saves 35 or more of the mice in a test group, or prolongs the average survival time by 4 or more days compared to infected, untreated controls. Tests are terminated 30 days after the day of infection. The results of this test of BM782 alpha 1 and BM782 alpha 2 are given in Table VIIA.

NRRL 11,239 ATCC 31497 may be carried out in a wide variety of liquid culture media. Media which are useful for the production of the novel antibiotics include an assimilable source of nitrogen such as protein, protein hydrolysate, polypeptides, amino acids, corn steep liquor, etc. an assimilable source of carbon such as starch, sugar, molasses, glycerol, etc. and inorganic anions and cations, such as potassium, sodium, calcium, sulfate, phosphate, chloride, etc.Trace elements such as boron, molybdenum, copper, etc., are supplied as impurities of other constituents of the media. Aeration in tanks and bottles is provided by forcing sterile air through or onto the surface of the fermenting medium. Further agitation in tanks is provided by a mechanical impeller. An antifoaning agent such as lard oil may be added as needed. Ino culum Preparation Shaker flask inoculum of Nocardia sp. NRRL 11,239 ATCC 31490 is prepared by inoculating 100 ml. of sterile liquid medium in 500 ml. flasks with scrapings or washings of the growth from an agar slant of the culture or by adding frozen vegetative seed to the flasks. The following medium is ordinarily used. Corn starch .................... 30g. Molasses 20g. Soy flour.......................... 15g. Calcium carbonate 10g. Water.............qs............... 1 litreFrozen vegetative seed is prepared by pipetting 5 10 ml. of vegetative liquid growth into sterile tubes and storing in a freezer at 8 F. The flasks are incubated at 250 290C., preferably 280C., and agitated vigorously on a rotary shaker for 24 48 hours. These 100 ml. portions of inocula are used to inoculate one litre and 12 litre batches of the same medium in 2 litre and 20 litre glass fermentors. The inoculum mash is aerated with sterile air while growth is continued for 24 to 48 hours. These batches of inocula are used to inoculate tank fermentors.Tank Fermentation For the production of the antibiotic in tank fermentors a fermentation medium of the following formulation is preferably used Corn starch ....................... 30 g. Molasses 20 g. Soy flour 15 g. Calcium carbonate 10 g. Water...............qs.................. 1 litre. Each tank is inoculated with 3 10 of its medium volume of inoculum prepared as described above. Aeration is supplied at the rate of 0.4 1.0 litre of sterile air per litre of broth per minute and the fermenting mixture is agitated by an impeller driven at 100 400 r.p.m. The temperature is maintained at 250 290C., usually at 28 C. The fermentation is ordinarily continued for 65 90 hours, at which time the mash is harvested based on determinations made using pR, mycelial growth and turbidimetric assay against K. pneumoniae. Isolation Procedure The harvested mash is combined with sodium fluoride in a ratio of 5 g. per litre of mash and adjusted to pH 6.5. This mixture is filtered through diatomaceous earth and washed with tap water. The combined filtrate and washing is put through a column containing a weak cation exchange resin in the sodium form in an approximate ratio of one litre of resin per 55 gallons of filtrate.The columnis washed first with demineralized water and then with an acetate buffer solution. The column is again washed with demineralized water and eluted with 0.36N sulfuric acid. Elution is continued until the eluate pH is 1.5. The eluate is adjusted to pH 6.5 with barium hydroxide and filtered. The filtrate is again adjusted to pH 6.5 and filtered. The filtrate is freeze dried providing a solid material.This solid is dissolved in water and chromatographed on a dextran cation exchanger in the sodium form. The column is equilibrated with 1 sodium sulfate at a pH slightly on the acidic side. The column is developed using a gradient of from 1, to 7 sodium sulfate solution. Fractions are collected and the product is detected by using ninhydrin, t butyl hypochlorite starch iodide or Sakaguchi reagents. Based on these colour tests the fractions containing 3M782 1, and EM782cR2 are combined separately. Each combination is passed through a column of granular carbon. The columns are washed free of salt and eluted with a solution of water acetone 60 40 .Each eluate is concentrated and freeze dried, providing essentially pure solid BM782 alpha 1 and BM782 alpha 2 preparations. The above procedure will yield antibiotics of the sulfate form. It will be obvious, to those skilled in the art, that the free base or other acid addition salts may be produced by art recognized methods. Among these methods are performing the elution steps utilizing the desired acid salt as eluent, or passing the above produced sulfate form of the antibiotic through a strong anion exchange resin bearing the desired acid addition salt. The invention is illustrated by the following specific examples. Example 1 Ino culum Preparation The medium used to grow the primary inoculum is prepared according to the following formula Corn starch ............................ 30 g. Molasses ............................. 20 g. Soy flour ............................... 15 g. Calcium carbonate ...................... 10 g. Water...................qs...................... 1 litre. Frozen vegetative seed, obtained from a prior inoculum mash inoculated with spores of RERL 11,239 ATCC 31497 , is used to inoculate two 500 ml. flasks each containing 100 ml. of the above sterile medium. The flasks are placed on a rotary shaker and agitated vigorously for 24 hours at 28 0C. The resulting flask inoculum is transferred to a 5 gallon glass fermentor containing 12 litres of the same sterile medium. The glass fermentor is aerated with sterile air while growth is carried out for 48 hours Example 2 Fermentation A medium is prepared according to the following formula Corn starch ........................... 30 g. Molasses ............................ 20 g. Soy flour ....................... 15 g. Calcium carbonate ..................... 10 g. Water.....................qs........................ 1 litre This fermentation medium is sterilized at 120 C. with steam at 15 pounds pressure for 45 60 minutes. The pH of the medium after sterilization is 7.1. Three hundred litres of the above sterile medium in a 400 litre tank fermentor is inoculated with 12 litres of inoculum prepared as described in Example 1 and the fermentation is carried out at 240 280C. using Hodag FD82 as a defoaming agent.Aeration is supplied at the rate of 0.4 litre of sterile air litre of mash minute. The mash is agitated by an impeller driven at 180 240 r.p.m. at the end of 66 90 hours of fermentation time, the mash is harvested. Example 3 Isolation of EM782ez1 A 300 litre portion of harvest mash prepared as described in Example 2 is combined with 1500 g. of sodium fluoride and adjusted to pH 6.5. The mixture is filtered through diatomaceous earth and washed with 40 litres of tap water. The combined filtrate and washings are put through a 5 litre bed of Amberlite IRC50 sodium form in a 4 inch x 60 inch glass column. The column is washed with 20 litres of demineralized water followed by 25 litres of a solution of sodium acetate 8 g. litre which is adjusted to pH 3.5 with glacial acetic acid. The column is then washed with 20 litres of demineralized water. The column is eluted with 0.36N sulfuric acid until the pH of the eluate reaches 1.5.The eluate is adjusted to pR 6.5 with barium hydroxide and filtered. The filtrate s readjusted to pH 6.5 with barium hydroxide and filtered A . A 300 litre harvest mash from an identical ferr ation is treated essentially as described above providing a second filtrate B . A 2 litre portion of the first filtrate A is freeze dried giving 13.0 g. of material A . A 7 litre portion of the second filtrate B is freeze dried giving 41.0 g. of material B . A 5 g. portion of A is dissolved in 35 ml. of water and is chromatographed over a 500 ml. column of CM Sephadex C25 sodium form which is equilibrated with 1 sodium sulfate solution at pH 6.7. The column is developed using a gradient of 1 7 sodium sulfate solution.Fractions of 70 ml. each are collected from the column. The fractions are tested by colour reagents such as ninhydrin, to determine which contain BM782s1. These fractions 100 112 are combined and passed through a column containing 50 ml. of granular carbon slurry.The column is washed with 2 litres of water and then eluted with 800 ml. of water acetone 60 40 solution adjusted to pH 4.5 with dilute sulfuric acid. The acid eluate is concentrated and freezedried giving 479 mg. of EM782ct1 as a hydrated sulfate salt. A 6.0 g. portion of B is treated in the same manner, combining fractions 85 97, passing them through a column containing a 60 ml. slurry of granular carbon, washing the column with one litre of water and eluting as above giving 500 mg. of BM782ot1 as a hydrated sulfate salt.
