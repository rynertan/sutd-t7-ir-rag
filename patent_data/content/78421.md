# Adaptive control system for machine tool or the like.

## Abstract
An adaptive control system for a machine tool or the like includes a temperature sensor for measuring spindle bearing temperature and two pairs of thrust sensors for measuring radial and axial spindle deflection. Data process ing apparatus, typically comprised of a microcomputer, is coupled to the temperature and thrust sensors and re gulates the percentage of oil in the oil air mixture lubrica tion mist sprayed on bearing contact surfaces in accordance with bearing temperature. The microcomputer simul taneously regulates the spindle bearing preload and spindle axis feedrate in accordance with radial and axial spindle thrust, thereby assuring optimum machine tool perfor mance.
