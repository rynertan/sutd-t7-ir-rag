# Combustion engine comprising a vaporizer pressure regulator.

## Abstract
A Combustion engine comprising an inlet duct 25 including a control valve 27 and a vaporizer pressure regulator having a first space divided into two parts 3,4 by a diaphragm 2 contained in said space, said diaphragm being provided for actuating a first shut off valve 10 co operating with a gas supply orifice of the first space, whilst the part 3 of the space in which the gas supply orifice opens out is connected through a connecting duct 13 with a second space 14 comprising a member affecting the gas pressure, said space communicating with the inlet duct 25 of the combustion engine, whereby that part 4 of the first space which is located on the side of the diaphragm actuating the first shut off valve remote from the first shut off valve is connected both downsteam and upstream of the control valve 27 with the inlet duct of the combustion engine through ducts 48,41,45 including means 46,47 acting upon the size of the passage of the ducts in dependence on the load of the combustion engine occurring during operation.
