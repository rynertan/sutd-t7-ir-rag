# Test system for integrated circuit and method of testing.

## Abstract
The conductive state of a transistor in a semiconductor integrated circuit 10 is determined by irradiating the transistor with a radiation beam and measuring changes in load current, thereby indicating whether the transistor was conducting or non conducting prior to irradiation. A corre lated double sampling method is employed in measuring changes in load current. A load resistor 42 in series with the device under test is capacitively coupled to differential amplification means 46 including a plurality of differential amplifiers with buffers connected between successive ampli fiers. A system clock 44 is stopped at a predetermined time period prior to irradiating the transistor. A bypass switch 43 shunts the load resistor 42 until the clock 44 is stopped.
