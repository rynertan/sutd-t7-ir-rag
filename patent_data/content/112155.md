# A METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR CULTURING AND TREATING SUBSTANCES DISPOSED IN A FLOWING CULTURE FLUID

## Abstract
The disclosure relates to a method and system utilizing double flows for simultaneously culturing cells suspended in a flow of culture fluid 11 extending across one surface of a membrane 14 and removing waste products from the cell containing fluids through the membrane from the oppo site surface thereof. The disclosure further relates to a method and system for culturing cells suspended in a flow of culture fluid extending across one side of a membrane by supplying nutrients through the membrane by osmotic diffusion. There is also disclosed a method and system for utilizing double flows for simultaneously culturing, aerating and otherwise treating cells suspended in a flow of culture fluid extending across one side of a membrane.
