## Description
The present invention relates to a method for identifying the serological grouping of streptococci. It is very important, clinically, to identify the group to which a particular streptococcus belongs. Conventionally, streptococcal grouping is identified by extracting the group specific antigens from the cells of the streptococcus, mixing the group specific antigens with antibodies specific to each of the Lancefield groups A, B, C, D, F and G and then inspecting each antigen antibody mixture for agglutination to indicate the occurrence of an antigen antibody reaction. Observation of agglutination is conventionally facilitated by the use of group specific antibodies bound to minute particles of a carrier material, such as polystyrene latex, which minute particles are suspended in the liquid in which the test is being carried out. The group specific antigens are extracted or released from the streptococcus cell walls, so that they are available for reaction with the group specific antibodies, by subjecting the streptococcus cells to the action of certain proteolytic enzymes. Examples of proteolytic enzymes utilized for this purpose include trypsin, lysozyme and pronase, an enzymic preparation obtained from We have found that the disadvantages associated with the use of the prior art enzymes do not arise with the use of achromopeptidase to expose the streptococcal antigen sites. The present invention provides a method for identifying the grouping of a streptococcus which method comprises treating sample of the streptococcus with achromopeptidase, contacting the treated sample with group specific antibody bound to minute, insoluble carrier particles and examining the mixture for agglutination. Achromopeptidase is the name given to the bacteriolytic enzyme obtained from EP 151783 Abbott published on 21 August 1985 and claiming a priority date of 27 January 1984 forms part of the state of the art under Article 54 3 EPC in respect of the contracting states DE, GB, FR and IT. Ep 151783 is primarily concerned with the use of achromopeptidase enzyme in agglutination assays for group A streptococci. The present invention further provides a kit for use in the above described method for identifying the grouping of a streptococcus comprising In order to facilitate observation of any agglutination reaction, the group specific antibodies are bound to minute carrier particles which are in suspension in the liquid medium in which the tests are carried out. Minute particles of polystyrene latex, bacteria or charcoal are conventionally used as carriers for the antibody and are suitable for use in the present invention. Typically, the carrier particles may be coloured in order to facilitate further the observation of agglutination. Methods of binding the group specific antibodies are known in the art and need not be further discussed here. A kit will usually comprise, in separate containers, a latex reagent for each of the Lancefield groups A, B, C, D, F and G wherein each latex reagent comprises a suspension of the carrier bound antibody specific to a particular antigenic group a positive control containing extracts from all six of the group antigens and achromopeptidase. Preferably, the achromopeptidase contains a preservative, such as thiomersal. Also the latex reagents and the positive control will typically contain a preservative, for example, sodium azide. Usually, a sample of the streptococcus to be identified is taken from an infected area and cultured and the suspected offending bacteria, are then extracted and treated with a solution of achromopeptidase made up in 0.01 M Tris HCl, pH 8.0. The mixture may then be incubated overnight at 4 C or alternatively for 5 15, preferably 10 minutes at a temperature of from about 37 to 56 C. A drop of the resulting mixture is then placed on a glass slide and mixed with the grouping reagent containing a homogeneous suspension of carrier particles bound or coated with antibody specific to a particular antigenic group. The glass slide test is repeated for each grouping reagent for each of groups, A, B, C, D, F and G. Each slide is gently rocked and then examined for agglutination. Latex agglutination tests were carried out to identify the group antigen of streptococci classified in each of the Lancefield groups A, B, C, D, F and G, using different extraction enzymes. The enzymes used were as follows The results are shown below wherein Latex agglutination tests were carried out to identify the group antigens of 22 streptococcal strains classified biochemically as group D but which contain G group antigens in addition to D group antigens cf. The Lancet , April 14, 1984, page 856 . The reagents used were the Oxoid latex reagent using achromopeptidase Takeda Chemical Industries Ltd. made up in 0.01M tris HCl, pH 8.0, as the extraction enzyme and STREPTEX Wellcome Diagnostics with pronase as the extraction enzyme. Out of 22 strains tested, the Oxoid reagent using achromopeptidase correctly identified all 22 as strains classified biochemicall as group D and identified the presence of group G antigen in 7 of the strains. We found that, with STREPTEX , agglutination for group G appeared first followed by agglutination for group D. However, with the Oxoid reafent using achromopeptidase, D agglutination appears before G agglutination. Although the STREPTEX grouping kit identified the presence of D and G group antigens in all 22 strains, the order in which it did this could lead to confusion or misidentification of the Lancefield grouping.
