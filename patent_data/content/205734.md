# QUINODIMETHANE COMPOSITIONS

## Abstract
This invention provides a novel class of quinodimeth ane compounds which can exhibit nonlinear optical re sponse. In one embodiment this invention can provide a high performance nonlinear optical substrate which comprises a transparent organic polymer film containing an array of charge asymmetric molecules such as 13,13 diamino 14,14 dicyanodiphenoquinodimethane
