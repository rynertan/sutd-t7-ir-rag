## Description
CATTLE FROM PARTIALLY HYDROLYZED LIGNO CELLUSOSIC MATERIALS AND UREA AND PROCESS OF MANUFACTURE The present invention concerns a ruminant fodder made from fibrous ligno cellulosic substances such as straw, oat chaff, corn stumps, husk, bagasse of sugar canes, etc..., this material having been subjected to partial acid hydrolysis, and urea. The invention also concerns a process for manufacturing this fodder. It is kmwn that, besides a certain proportion of mineral salts and extractable substances, the above lignosellulosic materials consist of a polymeric backbone the chemical structure of which consists of approximately 1 3 of cellulose, V3 of hemicellulose and i 3 of lignin. Consequently, such materials nor mally provide very unsatisfactory fodders for ruminants because they are only poorly attacked, during digestion, by the saccharolytic micro organisms present in the rumen of these animals.These drawbacks have been cured partially by subjecting the ligno cellulosic materials to controlled hydrolysis with the result that a fraction thereof is converted to reducing sugars directly assimilable, in principle and that the insoluble fraction is rendered more accessible to digestion by the enzymes. Thus, USP No 3.939.286 teaches a method for treating comminuted vegetal materials, such as wooden chips, various cereal straw, bagasse, etc...so as to improve their digestibility by ruminants. This method comprises treating a mixture of such materials and water with an acid at pH below 3 in the presence of a salt of iron or of manganese, then oxidizing the mass under heat and pressure, then hydrolyzing under the same conditions such as to convert at least one portion of the treated substances into saccharides and saccharic acids. According to another process French Patent No 2.264.489 the ligno cellulosic material is treated under pressure up to 160 C with relatively concentrated solutions of acids such as H3Po4, HCl, and H2904 so as to hydrolyze a significant portion of the cellulose moiety of the crude material and produce reducing sugars. It is knawn, on the other hand, that oellulosic products cannot, by themselves, entirely fulfill the feeding requirements of cattle because the latter need, as do other living beings, nitrogen containing materials for building up their organic texture.Therefore, in addition to polysaccharide fodders, cattle is fed with a significant proportion of protein materials such as oilseed cakes, cereals, edible meals, etc... of which a large fraction could be used for human consumption. This concept is therefore in contradiction with the objective of proving the cereal supply intended for poor and undevelopped countries. Hence, it has been sought to replace the plant protein normally given to cattle by simple nitrogen compcunds, not edible by man, such as ammonium salts, urea and condensation products between arrrtx ia and carbohydrates. Conventionally, urea is snmply mixed with the cattle fodder but this method has a serious drawback.Thus, in the stomach of ruminants urea is rapidly decomposed by urease with liberation of artitalia. This ammonia is normally used by the microorganisms present in the digestive tract for synthesizing the amino acids which are the precursors of further living matter. However, in the case of free urea rich fodders, an instant excess of ammonia development may happen with consequent toxicity hazard for the animals and significant loss of nitrogen by excretion. This sort of drawback has been cured ky providing the urea in the fodder in the form of slow release urea , that is in the form of urea derivatives the attack of which ty intestinal microorganisms is much slower than of free urea and which, as a consequence, liberate ammonia slower and during an extended period. Such derivatives are represented by urea aldose compounds, namely glycosylureas obtained by condensing reducing sugars with urea. There exists an abundant literature on the subject of which sane important referenoes are quoted in sane earlier applications of the present Applicants, namely No 7159 77 and 1585 78 as well as in USP No 4.066.750. Thus, such glycosylureas can be produced from glucose, lactose, xylose, molasses, hydrolyzed woed products, etc..., and it has been shown that by using them in fodders in the place of free urea marked nutritional improvement was experienced, which was noted because of the weight increase of the ruminants thus fed.Furthermore, as the Applicants have shown previously, the use of purified glucosylurea in cellulose based fodders causes an improved digestibility of the cellulose fraction thereof. The e Applicants have now disoovered that it is possible to combine the advantages arising from the use, for feeding cattle, of a partially hydrolyzed ligno cellulosic fodder and urea in the form of a slow release onpad. Thus, the Applicants have provided an entirely new type of fodder. This fodder, based on acid partly hydrolyzed ligno cellulosic materials of which the hydrolysis extent corresponds to the formation, by kg of the starting material, of at least me gram mo, le of aldoses, in the form of reducing mono and oligo saccharides, and which contains, by kg of the starting material, at least t o moles of urea of vr.ich a quantity is bound, in the form of ureido aldoses to such reducing saccharides, in the proportion of one molecule of urea per aldehyde function of said saccharides, is characterized by the fact that at least one portion of the remaining urea not bound to the reducing sugars from hydrolysis is present under a form that is still not instantaneously degradable by urease and that has a nitrogen slow release capacity when used as feed stuff for ruminants. In general, the degree of hydrolysis of this fodder, calculated on the basis of the amount of mono and oligo saccharides formed fran 1 kg of dry starting ligno cellulosic material, corresponds to about 1 to 2 moles of reducing sugars and the fodder of the invention comprises, still per kg of said starting material, fran about 2 to 5 moles of urea of which 1 to 2 moles are bound to said reducing sugars as ureido aldoses, 1 to 2 moles are lin ked to the insoluble portion of the ligno cellulosic material and are not instantly degradable by urease and the remainder of which, in case there is such a remainder, is under the form of free urea Dr as the salt thereof with the acid having been used for hydrolysis.It should be mentioned at this stage, that the existence rf acid prehydrolysed ligno cellulosic based forages containing urea, part of which is retained under the form of nitrogen slow release ureido aldoes when used for feeding ruminants, is not new per Se. Indeed, methods for manufacturing such forages are disclosed in US Patents No 3.878.304 commat RE and 4.089.980 BEBS3BR et al .However, in such prior art documents, there is explained that the nitrogen slow release urea is definitely bound to the sugars resulting from the hydrolysis and it is indicated nowhere in said patents that a portion of the remaining urea, that is the urea not bonded to said sugars, may still be linked to the fiber and be capable of slowly releasing its nitrogen content when used as a cattle feedstuff. Moreover, an examination of the various practical examples given in said references indicates that the proportion of bound urea, in the cases of the prior art fodders, is, in general, much below that of the fodders of the present invention. It must be noted that, depending cn the quantity of urea ad ded after hydrolysis and subjected to condensation, the feedstuff can be more or less rich in nitrogen. It is generally accepted that the level of protein equivalent of a feedstuff is equal to the nitrogen level times 6.25. Thus, with the present fodder which oon tains, per kg of dry starting material, about 2 to about 5 moles of urea, that is a proportion hy weight of 120 1120 to 300 1300 0.107 0.23 or 5 to 11 of nitrogen, the protein equivalent is about 30 to 60 , which can be favorably compared with cereals barley for instance which only contain about 13 protein equivalent.In practice, for feeding ruminants, there will be used mixtures of fodders, such mixture being more or less rich in the fodder of the invention depending on the nitrogen equivalent of the latter and on the nitrogen content of the other constituents of said mixture. As an example, a typical feedstuff can contain 20 40 of the forage of the invention, 40 60 of cereals, the remainder oomr prising additives, fats, etc... The preferred forms of the fodder of the invention contain, per kg of dry starting material, about 1.5 mole of urea under the glyoosylurea form, about 1.5 mole of urea bound to the fiber and a variable quantity of free urea depending on the total amount used fcr the condensation. This last amount can be reduced if desired by using less urea in the condensation step or otherwise the hydrolyzing step can be extended to values exceeding 30 in which case the glycosylurea bound urea will be increased at the expense of the free urea. The e fodder of the invention has a color ranging fran tan to deep brown depending on the manufacturing oonditions temperature and extent of hydrolysis temperature of the condensation reaction, etc ... . It consists of a mass of agglomerated fibers, the general physical aspect of which is not much different from the original chopped material except for increased frangibility and reduced resilience. Its palatability for animals is good, especially when manufactured by using iri and final neutralization of the residual acid by NaOH which forms a significant amount of salt much appreciated by ruminants. The e process of manufacture of the present fodder is characte rized by the fact that a one contacts the liXno cellulcsic material with a diluted acid and one heats the components so as to hydrolyze into reducing saccharides at least the hemi cellulosic portion of said material and b one plots this material thus prehydrolyzed and retaining, besides the saccharides thus produced, at least one portion of the acids used for hydrolysis in contact with a urea solution, one heats the whole mixture so as to cause a fixation of this urea, because of the catalytic action of the acid present, partly on the insoluble fibers of the prehydrolyzed material and partly on the re ducking sugars formed by hydrolysis by condensation and formation of glycosylureas. Thus, the process of the present invention contrasts strongly with the methods of the prior art, namely those disclosed inUSP 3,878,304 and 4,089,980, in which the ligno cellulosic starting material is heated in contact with a mixture of urea and acid. Thus the drawbacks of such prior art methods which require large amounts of acids to overcome the basicity of the urea and in which part of this urea is destroyed because of the presence of a large quantity of acid are overcome. According to a first edbcdiment of the process of the invention, one proceeds as follows al One heats the ligno cellulosic material with a diluted acid solution rich in reducing sugars formed by the hydrolysis of said material, so as to hydrolyze the major part of the hemi cel lulcsic fraction thereof, a2 one drains the material but without drying it completely, in order that it retains, impregnated within its fibers, part of the hydrolysis solution, b one contacts the material thus still wet with a concen trated aqueous urea solution and one heats the mixture while distilling off the water which, under the catalytic influence of the acid present, causes the condensation of the reducing saccharides with a portion of the urea present and the fixing of another portion thereof on the insoluble fibers of said material. It has not been explained by which Phenomenon a significant part of the urea present becomes linked to the insoluble fibers of the ligno cellulosic material in a form not easily degradable by urease but independently of its condensation with the soluble reducing saccharides. Attempts have been made to know whether this surprising property was preserved after leaching out the soluble reducing sugars by washing the freshly hydrolysed material with water, but it was noted that it was not... Indeed, after such leaching and subsequent drying of the hydrolyzed material, the urea retention was only about 10 8, i.e. about 100 g nearly 1,6 mole per kg of dry material, which corresponds substantially to the retention capacity of the same, non hydrolyzed, material e.g. straw or bagasse. In contradistinction, in the fodder of the invention, wherein there has been formed, after hydrolysis, about 1,6 1,8 mole of reducing sugars xylose, hexoses and oligcsaccharides per log of dry material and which has been further treated with 5 mole 300 g of urea, there remains, bonded to said sugars, 1,6 1,8 mole 95 1l0 g of urea and, linked to the insoluble fibers, 2,5 3 mole of urea 150 180 g , the rest being present in the form of unbound urea or in the form of a salt of urea with the residual acid fran the catalyzed condensation. It is however known that the hydrolysis of polysaccharides is a reversible reaction, sane of the oligame ric aldoses being repolymerizable upon neutralization of the medium.It is therefore possible that such aldosos, in insoluble form, be present in the fibrous portion of the freshly hydrolyzed material and that, under these conditions, the reactive carbonyl function thereof is capable to condense with urea. Such a reactivity could possibly disappear by repolymerization after leaching out the water soluble hydrolyzed portion which would explain the loss of the fixing property relative ho urea, by the washing of the hydrolyzed material. When the present process is applied to the manufacture of the present fodder on the industrial scale, it is advantageous to perform the preliminary hydrolysis in a solution the concentration in sugars of which is adapted for having, impregnated in the solid hydrolyzed material after draining, a quantity of said sugars s stantially equal to that which has just become available during said hydrolysis operation. For achieving this, one operates in a semi oontinuous manner by using, for treating successively a series of identical charges, the same hydrolyzing solution wnich is replenished, after each operation, with a quantity of acid and water equal to that removed hy the previous load. As an illustration, there is given in annex a schematic representation of a device for embcdying the process of the invention. The e only figure represents an installation for treating ligno cellulosic materials y, by, successively, hydrolysis and oondensation with urea. This installation comprises, identically equipped and symmetrically connected together, two reactors la and lb provided with sprayers 2a and 2b for the introduction of liquids and cutlet vanes 3a and 3b. These vanes 3 are connected to pumps 4a and 4b feeding the 3 way valves 5a and Sb which enable, either to recycle a liquid contained in the reactor through pipes 6a and 6b, or to pump it into the twin reactor via the storage tanks 7a and 7b, respec tively. The reactors further comprise inlets 8a and 8b for introducing liquid charges and steam outputs 9a and 9b, the steam being condensable in the condensers lOa and lOb.The reactors still orm prise hot air input ducts lla and llb, the material to be treated being enclosed in the baskets 12a and 12b, the latter being made of stainless steel or heat resistant synthetic resins for instance. The present device operates as follows under running con ditions, the reactors operate simultaneously in the first one the hydrolysis is carried out, in the other the condensation with urea is carried out, and alternatively. It will be understood, for the purpose of illustration, that the process is started with a hydrolysis step effected in reactor la. Fbr this, basket 12a loaded with ligno cellulosic material, e.g. oomminuted straw, is introduced into said reactor which contains a 1 3 solution of SC1 0,28 0,8N , or H2SO4 or H3PO4 and about 300 9 1 of xylose. Admittedly, in this case the solid to liquid weight ratio is roughly 1 10.The mixture is boiled for 2 3 hrs, the 9 10th of the hydrolyzing liquid is drained ty means pf the pump 3a and this liquid is introduced into reactor la through tank 7b and input 8b. The prehydrolyzed straw load in basket 12a therefore contains, dissolved in he inpregnating liquid, a quantity of reducing su gars approximately equal to that produced in the course of the hydrolysis operation as well as a portion of the acid put into reaction. There is introduced, then, via input 8a and sprayer 2a, a concentrated urea solution containing about 2 to 3 equivalents of that compound as calculated fran the quantity of sugars estimated to be present in said prehydrolyzed straw. The mixture is heated to 90 100 C while continuously recycling the liquid and distilling through outlet 9a and condenser lOa.After 2 3 hrs, the reactor inside pressure is reduced and the drying is completed hy the introduction of heated air through ducts lla. Then basket 12a is withdrawn fran the reactor and the completed fodder is sent to storage. While the reaction with urea is carried cut in reactor la, hydrolysis of an identical load of straw enclosed in basket 12b is performed in reactor Ib under conditions similar to that set forth hereinabove. Once this operation has been completed, the whole process is repeated integrally, the additions fran the outside being limited to the replenishment, after each cycle, of the hydrolysis aqueous solution with water and acid, and to the in production into the reactors at the proper times of new portions of straw and urea. The device is therefore simple and economical to operate and only requires to have available the starting materials, water and cheap acid complements.In addition it can be transported on a Rhicule and can be displaced d thus enabling to produce a valuable fodder directly at places where vegetal refuses are available. Such movable installation is therefore particularly useful in deprived areas lacking forages and in which vegetal refuses sometimes available in large quantities are normal ly discarded or burned. According to a modification of the present process, the hydrolysis is performed by injecting in the mass of ligno cellulosic material a quantity of steam loaded with acid, such quantity being calculated so that the amount of liquid formed is small or nearly non existent and that the soluble reducing sugars thus formed remain adsorbed on the insoluble fibers of the prehydrolyzed material. Then, the urea condensation phase is carried out like in the process described hereinabove. This modification permits avoiding the transfer of liquids from one point to another point and decreases the weight of the displaceable reagents. This injection of steam loaded with acid can be performed very simply and involves only little modification to the device represented cn the drawing. It is sufficient to install on the reactor inside walls and in close relationship with the mass to be treated some banks of injection nozzles supplied with a classical steam source. The distribution piping for that steam is provided with an aspiration system for instance a Venturi tube which is connected to an acid tank. Thus, the steam flow provides a suction effect which, by means of the Venturi tube, produces an acid mist that blends with the steam, both components thus penetrating simultaneously into the mass to be hydrolyzed. It should be also realized that it is also possible to work as follows to achieve the prehydrolysis of the ligno cellulosic material one starts with a diluted acid impregnation of said terial, for instance by soaking the latter in the solution, said acid solution being actually more concentrated 3 6 than the acid solution described hereintofore, then when this soaked material is placed in the reactor, one injects steam heated to 100 1300C therein in order to achieve a very hooogeneous heating effect without requiring to stir or agitate the material.Naturally, during this operation, part of the steam condenses in the material thus lowering the acid level thereof in order to reach, at the end of hydrolysis, the levels indicated previously 1 3 . In this process mcdification, it is advantageous that the amount of liquid which eventually separates fran the ligno cellulosic material be as low as possible in order to minimize the reducing sugar losses hot ever, after the end of the hydrolysis when carried out under such conditions, the required quantity of urea can simply be dissolved into said condensate and this resulting solution can be again put into contact with the solid material for condensation.Most of the liquid being thereafter eliminated by evaporation or distillation, the products previously dissolved are again bound to the fiber at the end of this operation. In the case of such modification, the evaporation or distillation temperatures for instance with hot air can be of the order of 709O0 but this is only indicative.Also, in such case, it is ezoncmically advantageous to work in a single reactor. The steam used in this modification can be provided ty noz zles oonnected to a source of steam outside the reactor and injecting steam within the mass to be hydrolyzed with a degree of pressure that can be controlled at will depending on the steam introduction rate and the desired temperature. Alternately, the steam can be generated within the reactor itself by providing a layer of water at the bottom thereof underneath the material to be treated. The reactor is then heated by outside means, e.g. by means of a heating coil, until the water in the reactor starts to boil and thus furnishes steam to the material to be hydrolyzed. Another factor which is important is the acid effective concentration during the phase of condensation between urea and the fiber impregnated with the sugars resulting from the prehydroly sis and the acid used to promote such hydrolysis. It is evident that, when carrying out the process of the invention by using steam as the heating weans for hydrolysis and, afterwards hot air for effecting the condensation between urea and the sugar loaded fiber, the moisture will be progressively eliminated and there will be a time when the acid dissolved in the residual water impregna ted in the fibers may became cqerooncentrated for properly acting as a condensation catalyst and may pranote some kind of degradation of the glyco6yl urea already formed. This undesirable side reaction may lead to the formation of undigestible nitrogen pounds and may decrease the value of the product as a feedstuff.It has therefore been found that partial neutralization of the acid may be advantageous to avoid such drawbacks, particularly when U sing a non volatile acid to effect the hydrolysis and the condensation AH P 4 or H3PO4 when HC1 is used this kind of drawback is minimized because SC1 progressively escapes out of the product when the condensation is effected under distilling oonditions. When partial neutralization is contemplated, this is effected by adding the calculated amount of base at the end of the hydrolysis stage or together with the urea before condensation or by spraying the mass after the addition of the urea for instance when the mass is conditioned before the final condensation heating step . Another point which is worth mentionning is the desirability of avoiding overheating during the condensation stage, particularly if the concentration of acid is on the high side toward the end of the reaction, because of the extent of evaporation of the water e.g. when the concentration of the acid impregnated in the fiber exoeeds, say 10 20 . Thus, it is advantageous to carry out the condensation operation by first evaporating under reduced pressure and at relatively low temperature the excess of water e.g. 40 504C in order to reach an optimum concentration of acid e.g. about 3 10 of acid in the solution impregnated in the fibers , then shut the evacuating valve to ncmentarily stop the evaporation of the water and heat to optimal condensation temperature, e.g. 70 80 until the condensation is complete, then d gain reduce the temperature down to about 40 50 and reestablish the vacuum until the required degree of dryness is achieved. The examples that follow illustrate the invention. Example 1 Preparation of a cattle fodder In a 20 1 pyrex or stainless steel reactor provided with a stirrer and a reflux condenser, there was introduced 1.1 kg of chop ped fodder containing 10 moisture 1 kg of dry matter . Such a fodder can consist, for instance, of chaff and cereal straw, rice hulls, corn cobs, sugar cane bagasse, cellulose residues, etc...Its approximate atpo5ition is hemi cellulose 20 30 cellulose 30 50 the rest, i.e. lignin, mineral salts and extractable subZ stance. Then, there was added about 10 1 of a diluted acid solution containing about 300 g l of xylose plus the other reducing sugars originating fran the hydrolysis of another load of the same lignoocellulosic material as treated in the present exairle. As the acid, the following can preferably be selected HC1 1 total Iri 100 g , HO4 or H3PO4 2.5 . The mixture was agitated and boiled for 2 3 hours, which effected the hydrolysis of the hemi cellulosic fraction of the ma terial and liberated about 80 96 of soluble reducing sugars and about 20 of reducing disaccharides and oligosaccharides partially soluble, the solubility depending on the degree of hydrolysis.In a specific case where bagasse was used, chere was formed about 220 g of xylose 1.46 mole and 22 g of hexoses 0.122 mole i.e. a total of 1,582 mole of soluble sugars. The material was drained and 9 1 of the solution were remo ved, after which there was introduced, in the place, a solution of 270 g 4.5 mole of urea in about 600 ml H20 at 500C. The mixture was slowly agitated and heated 5 hours to 900C. After about 1 hour heating time, the pressure was progressively decreased and the water slowly distilled off the reactor initial water content plus the water that formed during condensation between the aldehyde gropps ard urea . Finally, heating was continued for 2 3 hours at 600C 14 Torr until Eplete drying there was thus obtained 1235 g of a brown colored product. A sample of said product was subjected to the digestion test with urease in aqueons solution and, fran the results, it was concluded that the overall product contained only 89.5 g of free urea 1.5 mole attackable ty urease. Thus, besides the 1.58 mole of urea which had condensed with the soluble reducing sugars, there remained 4.5 1.5 1.582 nearly 1.4 mole of urea which was bound to the insoluble back one of the product and consisted of a significant amount of nitrogen slcerelease urea. The obtained crude product was analyzed for its total nitrogen content and the result 9.9 indicated that it contained the near totality of the 4.5 mole of urea added at the start. Of this urea, 3 mole 67 are under the form of slerelease urea glycosylureas plus the urea bound to the fiber , fran which the protein value of the fodder can be estimated as follows 9.9 x 0.67 x 6.25 41.5 96 protein equivalents slow release nitrogen axts . The obtained fodder, called A hereinunder, was evaluated in the diet of sheep for a period of three weeks. As control fodders B and C were prepared as follows B One kg of chopped straw was subjected to the prehydrolysis treatment described above after which the soluble sugars formed were washed away with pater until they were eliminated ooue tely. Then the humid mass was treated by 3 mole of urea in the same conditions described above. After distillation of the water, drying and analysis with urease, it was found that a small portion of the urea 30 g, 0.5 mole, about 10 of the originally used urea remained linked to the fiber in a form resistant to urease.There was then added to the fodder 1.6 mole of a 90 1 mixture of xylosylurea and glucosylurea, such mixture corresponding to the su gars, lost by the washing, which had thereafter been condensed separately with urea according to standard means. C C c kg of the sane chopped chopped straw stro was subjected to hydro lysis as described above then it was drained until it retained about 1 10 of the hydrolyzing solution i.e. a portion of that solution containing N 270 300 g of reducing sugars and it was mixed with 4.5 mole 270 g of urea. The mixture was then dried un der reduced pressure. Consequently, there were available three kinds of fodders A , B and C , the significant characteristics of which are summarized in the table below EMI14.1 tb SEP Slow release SEP Urea SEP Free SEP Urea tb SEP Pwroxim.

After three weeks the weight gains were measured and the following data were recorded The animals nourished with the feedstuff containing fodder B had increased weight 22 better than the ani mals nourished with the feedstuff containing fodder C . With feedstuff labelled A , the increase was 67 over C . These results show the very significant advantages brought up by the fodder of the invention in which the sltrelease urea coopounds are prepared within the forage itself in situ , as compared to prior art fodders in which the urea is, either free C , or under slow re lease form in large fraction, but mixed afterwards with the prehydrolyzed ligno cellulosic material. Example 2 Hydrolysis whereby heating is performed by ijecting steam In a 13 1 heat insulated cylindrical reactor adapted to withstand a pressure of 1.2 bar, there was introduced 1 kg of dry com minuted wheat straw which had been impregnated by soaking with two kg of 3 aqueous H2S04. Through the bottom of the reactor, steam at ll0 1200C was injected under a pressure of 0.6 1 bar. The unused steam was left to escape through adjustable valve at the top of the reactor after getting across the vegetal mass. During this injection 2 hrs the inside of the reactor was kept at a tfflperature of about 110 130 C under 0.6 1 bar of pressure. After that period, there was recovered 1.25 1 of xndensa te at the bottom of the reactor and the total of the wet mass of vegetal matter was 3.730 g, of which 730 g corresponded to dry matter and the three kg to the impregnating liquid. The analysis of the sugars in the condensate indicated the presence of 24.7 g of pentoses and 2.5 g of hexoses. The analysis of the sugars in the recovered wet vegetal mass indicated the presence therein of 164.5 g of pentoses and 19.8 g of hexoses. The total of the reducing sugars produced during hydrolysis amounted thus to 189.2 g of pentoses and 22.3 g of hexoses, which corresponded to the liberation of 1.26 mole of pentose and 0.125 mole of hexoses total 1.385 mole the yield of hydrolysis was therefore 70 for pentoses and 5 69s for hexoses, respectively, relative to the theory. Further, 87 of the freed sugars were retained cn the vegetal material whereas 13 had gone in the condensa te. After hydrolysis, 200 g of urea 3.3 mole were dissolved in the 1.25 1 of condensate and the obtained solution was added to the prehydrolyzed vegetal material in the column reactor so as to uniformly impregnate this material with the urea solution. In order to achieve this, the excess of liquid was circulated by means of a purtp which aspirated the liquid at the bottan of the reactor and reinjected it at the top. Simultaneously, air heated to 70 800C was introduced at the lower end of the column which enabled the progressive elimination of the impregnating water from the vegetal material with consecutive concentration of the sugars and urea for improvise the xedensation reaction leading to the glycosylureas brought the temperature inside of the reactor progressi vely it to 70 800C, which is the proper tensperature for having the condensation reaction sugar urea to take place in a reasonable time a few hours . The introduction of warm air was continued until the residual moisture of the vegetal material has dropped down to 10 20 .A sample of this material was extracted with water and the solution was analyzed with urease which showed, after extrapolating to the full lot, that only 1 10 of the original urea is still free and degradable by urease whereas the 90 of said urea are linked to the fodder and not instantly degradable by urease slaorelea se urea . The fodder thus obtained can be used to feed cattle as in the previous Example. However, it is preferably neutralized with a diluted solution of NaOH and again dried with hot air in order to improve its palatability to the animals. Example 3 Fixati of urea of urea on prehydrolyzed ligno cellulosic material Three 10 g portions of chopped wheat straw dry weight , samples D , E and F were selected and subjected to the following operations D The straw was immersed into a solution of 100 ml of 0.5N H2SO4, 20 ml H20 and 2.7 g urea 0.045 mole . The mixture was allowed to stand 24 hrs at room temperature after which the straw was drained and washed twice with 100 ml Hp Then, the straw was resoaked with 200 ml H20 and drained again.The draining and washing waters were collected total 400 ml and subjected to analysis which showed the presence of 2.43 g of urea therefore, 0.27 g 0.005 mole of urea were still bound to the straw 10 of the original amount . E The sample of straw was dipped into 100 ml of 0.5 N H2So4 and the whole was heated 5 hrs at 950 C reflux . After cooling, the straw was drained and carefully washed with 5 successive portions of 100 ml H20. The combined filtrate and washings were analyzed and shan to contain sugars the quantity of which amounted to 66 fran theory of C5 sugars and 6 of C6 sugars on the basis of the theoretical full degradation potentials of the hemicellulosic and cellulosic fractions of the straw used total about 0.015 mole of sugars present. The sample of prehydrolyzed and washed straw was mixed with a solution of 2.7 g of urea in 100 ml B2 and, under stirring, this mixture was evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure. Then the straw thus treated was heated and maintained at 800 C overnight.It was thereafter extracted with 250 ml Hp and the anylysis of the aqueous extract showed that about 0.27 g of the urea had remained stuck on the straw. F The sample of straw was dipped in 100 ml 0.5 N H2SO4 and heated 4 hrs under reflux 950 C . Analysis of a snall aliquot of the liquid showed that the extent of Cs and C6 sugar formation was identical with that of case E above. Then, a solution of 2.7 g of urea in 10 ml of water was added, the mixture was brought to 900 C and the pressure was reduced for eliminating the water by evaporation then the dry residue was heated overnight to 800 C.The obtained product was extracted with several successive portions of water total 250 ml and the analysis of these combined extracts was carried out. It was found that the washing extracts contained 0.970 g of free urea measurable with urease. Therefore, 1.73 g of urea 0.029 mole remained fixed on the fiber, either as gly oosylureas or in an undetermined form but not instantly degradable by urease and therefore having a slow release property. Since the total of the sugars was 0.015 mole, the portion of fiber bound urea was 0.02 0.015 0.015 mole, i.e. three times the quantity retained in cases D and E above.For the time being, the reasons for such unexpected and surprising increase in the quantity of the slow release urea are unknown which impart to the fodder of the invention its particularly advantageous nutritional properties. Exawple 4 Neutralization of the acid catalyst Ten kg of dry chopped straw were subjected to the same treatment described in Exanple 2 with 20 1 3 H2SO4 in a 100 1 cylin drical reactor provided with steam injectors at the bottom.The subsequent reactions heating with hot air and drying were carried out as further described in Example 2 after which, when the moisture content of the obtained product had dropped to about 10 20 the whole mass was spread cn a flat surface and sprayed as a thin layer 2 3 cm with 5 1 of water containing dissolved 490g of NaX. Thereafter, the product was put into a rotating drum and harogenized for 1 hr under rotation. Optionally, a stream of warm air was passed through the drum to further reduce the moisture con tent of the neutralized fodder.The palatability of the neutralized product was excellent when fed to cs and when free ci ice with soja cakes was possible, equal mounts of both feedstuff were eaten by the animals. Erame 5 Pelletizing of the fodder Ten kg of straw were grossly chopped until the average stalk pieces were about 2 3 cm. Then the mass was prehydrolyzed with 20 1 H4 3 and steam in a 100 1 reactor as described in Example 2. The wet acidified prehydrolyzed mass was placed in a lOO 1 horizontal drum mill and 2 kg of urea dissolved in 5 1 of liquid ccndensate fran the prehydrolysis plus sane water were added. The drum was rotated at room temperature for 6 hrs after which the moist mass had pelleted itself in roughly spherical or oblong pellets of about 1 2 cm size. The walls of the drum were clean and there was no umpelletized material left.For achieving this auto pel letizing process, chopping level of the straw, as well as prehydrolysis state, moisture content and the presence of urea are important although the exact range of these parameters has not been determined. Then the pellets were collected and heated with hot air at 70 800C to effect the condensation with urea. Such operation can be carried out if desired in the same reactor used for the prehy drolysis step. In this eOcdiitnt, it was sometimes found advantageous to partially neutralize the acid in the pellets before effecting the condensation with urea in order to minimize the effect of poS5i ble acid overconcentration during elimination of the excess of moisture. This neutralization was effected by adding the required arlunt of base to neutralize about 8 10 of the original amount of acid, i.e. 390 g of NaOH, dissolved in the urea containing solution.
