# Method of food heating control and apparatus therefor.

## Abstract
A method of food heating control is disclosed in which the heating time length τ₀ from a time point t₁ when the food temperature changing with the heating thereof reaches a predetermined set value T₁ to a time point t₂ when the vapor or gas liberated by heating of the food begins to increase the humidity or gas concentration is used as a basis for automatically determining a subsequent heating time length τ
