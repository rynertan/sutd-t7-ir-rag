# Seat with a dual adjustable armrest.

## Abstract
A seat has an armrest pivotable between an operating position approximately parallel to the seat cushion and a position parallel to the seat back, and translatable in the operating position between two heights with respect to the seat cushion. A first member 6 fixed to the seat back 1 includes an arcuate cutout 21 and a pin receiving portion 23 . A second member 5 is pivotably connected to the first member 6 opposite a first end of the cut out 21 , and is pivotably connected to the armrest 2 , the distance bet ween the pivotal points approximating the radius of curva ture of the cut out 21 . The armrest 2 has a projecting pin 20 engagable in the cut out 21 , which serves to guide the pin 20 , and thus the armrest 2 , during rotation of the armrest 2 . A recess at the first end of the cut out 21 allows the pin 20 to disengage therefrom and the pin 20 can then be raised to the level of the pin receiving member 23 and supported thereby.
