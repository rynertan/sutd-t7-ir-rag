# Halogen containing polymers stabilized with organic antimony compound and an ortho mercapto phenol compound.

## Abstract
Compositions which are effective in stabilizing polymers against the deteriorative effects of heat are provided com prising 1 an organic antimony compound or mixture of organic antimony compounds and 2 an organic compound or mixture of organic compounds having an aromatic ring which is substituted with hydroxy OH and mercapto SH groups ortho to each other. Also provided are polymer compositions containing said stabilizers and articles of manufacture made from said stabilized polymer composi tions.
