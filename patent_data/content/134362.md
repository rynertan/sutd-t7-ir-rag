# A method for keeping melt in a blind riser hot during casting operations, and a product for doing this.

## Abstract
When casting materials by feeding melt into a mould 5 , such as metal into a sand mould, there can be problems of internal quality of the cast product due to cavities caused by shrinkage upon cooling and solidification. It is known, therefore to provide blind risers 2 which act as a head or reservoir to feed melt to the product it is desirable to keep melt within the riser hot and liquid for the whole time that the cast product is solidifying and shrinking. The invention comprises a method for keeping melt within a riser hot during the product solidification stage by providing a pre formed body 3a of an exothermic composition which can be positioned in the riser or in a cavity or channel communicating with the riser and which will float or be suspended in the melt in the riser and give out heat to keep the melt in the riser liquid, and in another aspect the invention provides a product for carrying out the method.

## Description
A METHOD FOR XEEPING MELT IN A BLIND RISER HOT DURING CASTING OPERATIONS, AND A PRODUCT FOR DOING THISThis invention relates to a method for heat retaining of a blind riser that is to say keeping the contents of a blind riser hot in a casting operation and a heat retaining agent for the blind riser, with the purpose of enhancing the feeding effect of a blind riser in manufacturing castings from a melt, such as by using molten metal poured into a sand mould.Generally, when manufacturing castings from metals using moulds, in order to obtain cast products which are of sound quality internally it is advisable to try and prevent the formation of a cavity within the product caused by the shrinkage of molten metal upon solidification, and so there is provided a riser in the mould at a location corresponding to a thick portion of the product or at a neighbouring portion. A riser may loosely be described as a channel or head or reservoir for the melt communicating with the product being cast.There are selectively used in moulds, depending upon the shape of the cast product and the flask or the particular shrinkage characteristics of the melt, an open riser in which the upper surface of the riser is open to the upper surface of the flask and a blind riser in which the upper surface of the riser is closed within the flask.When a blind riser is employed the following techniques are used to make the riser effective and to cause to be fed smoothly from the blind riser the melt equivalent to the solidification shrinkage amount of the casting 1 the blind riser is heat retained that is it is so constructed as to keep the riser hot or it is provided with means for keeping the riser hot in order that the blind riser may not be solidified quicker than the desired casting 2 a gas such as air at atmospheric pressure is introduced within the blind riser to accelerate the transfer of melt from the blind riser to the casting.For technique 1 above, it is known to enclose the blind riser within a moulded sleeve of a material having exothermic or heat insulating property or both exothermic and heat insulating properties for technique 2 above it is known to employ an N atmospheric N riser in which a good air permeating, heat insulating or exothermic core is inserted from the top of the blind riser toward the centre of the riser and it is also known to use a blind riser sleeve and to adopt both of techniques 1 and 2 above.However, these known techniques have the following disadvantages. In the technique of using a moulded sleeve, there can be trouble at the time of mounting the sleeve in the sand mould or pattern, there can be deformation or breakage of the sleeve in the moulding process and or there can be problems of release of the sleeve from the sand mould with regard to the technique of using an atmospheric riser the problems are the trouble of inserting a core into the required portion of the riser and sand release caused by friction at the time of insertion. These disadvantages either cause delay in the cycle time of moulding or bring about defects in the internal quality of the casting.The present invention solves the problem of the known techniques and it is an object of the invention to provide in one aspect a method for the heat retaining of a blind riser, in which the performance of the blind riser is simply and effectively promoted, and in another aspect a heat retaining agent for a blind riser for use in said method. That is, the invention relates to a method for the heat retaining of blind riser, characterized in that in sand mould casting an exothermic composition of spherical body, rotary ellipsoid or polyhedron of more than hexahedron, or in the form of briquette is placed at least one per blind riser in the cavity portion of mould before pouring the melt, and said composition float.up as the melt flows in so as to be positioned at the top of the blind riser when the pouring of the melt has finished thereby heat retaining said top. The invention further relates to a heat retaining agent of blind riser in the moulding of sand mould, characterized in that the exothermic composition is a sphere, rotary ellipsoid or polyhedron of more than hexahedron, or in the form of briquette, and the bulk specific gravity is smaller than the specific gravity of the melt. As the exothermic composition herein used those conventionally presented for the heat retaining of riser of castings can be used as they are, and as to the blending ingredients of rate controlling the heating value it will suffice to select them within the range in which the bulk specific gravity is smaller than the specific gravity of the melt according to the capacity of the used blind riser and the desired exothermic reaction sustaining period of time. The reason why the composition is a sphere, rotary ellipsoid or polyhedron of more than hexahedron, or in the form of briquette is to consider the buffer effect for the sand mould wall when the melt floats up after pouring, and the sustaining effect of the exothermic reaction by the ignition after having contacted the melt.Then, even as to the moulding method in which the exothermic composition is formed as described above it is possible to carry out by a method where the composition is moulded by mould with the addition of known binder or by conventional technics such as briquette moulding process by pan pelletizing machine. Figs. 1 and 2 are vertical sectional views showing one example of the method for the heat retaining of blind riser of the invention. In casting of sand mould an exothermic heat retaining agent 3a of the invention is located at the cavity of a blind riser 2 within the mould before a cope 4a and a drag 4b are assembled. Additionally, depending on the configuration of the mould it is possible to locate said heat retaining agent 3a at the cavity of the blind riser even after the mould assembling. In the drawings reference numeral 1 designates a sprue and reference 5 a cavity of the mould. The thus obtained heat retaining agent of blind riser of the invention can be used being simply placed at the cavity of the blind riser 2 of said sand mould.This method can be easily carried out at the optional period of time before the cope and drag 4a, 4b are assembled in the moulding process of the mould, and according to the casting plan to be applied, for example in case there exists an opening to the outside of the mould, which opening is communicated with a position expected for placing the heat retaining agent, it is possible to place it even after the mould assembling. It is capable of selecting the placing position of the heat retaining agent 3a at any place such that said agent 3a can be positioned 3b at the top of the blind riser when the pouring of the melt has finished, after said agent has floated up by the flow of the melt, namely in the neighbourhood of the blind riser. Being the shortest distance to the top of the blind riser, however, it is preferable to constitute the bottom of the blind riser with a cavity. A single briquette of the heat retaining agent will suffice for use per blind riser, but a plurality of briquette. of said agent can be used, if necessary, to keep the balance with the volume of the blind riser. Additionally, to prevent the exothermic moulded composition 3a arranged within the blind riser from transferring into the mould cavity 5 the gate between the blind riser 2 and the mould cavity 5 is made naturally smaller than the dimension of said composition. Then when the melt is poured into the mould, as shown in Fig. 2, said heat retaining agent easily floats up with the flow of the melt and is ignited from its contact portion with the melt while generating heat, and finally it reaches the top of the blind riser thereby to stop there 3b . In the floating up process said heatretaining agent as well as the inner wall of the mould is not impaired thanks to its shape when contacting the wall portion of the sand mould, and therefore any casting defect regarding the casting surface or the quality of casting is not brought about. Since the heat generation of said heat retaining agent is started at the same time as its contact with the melt as described above, the melt surface enclosing said agent reaches the top of the blind riser while being heat retained, together with said agent. The generated heat is maintained for a predetermined period of time according to the selection of constitution, shape, dimension of said heat retaining agent, so that the blind riser is solidified slowly whereby the feeding effect to the casting is accelerated. Further, thanks to the air permeability possessed by said heat retaining agent the atmospheric pressure is introduced into the blind riser without a hitch, allowing the feeding effect to be accelerated. In the blind riser after solidification in the casting article in which the present invention has been carried out, a shrinkage cavity remains in the area from the top portion to the core portion as a result of the heat retaining effect by said heat retaining agent and the sufficient feed of melt to the casting, and in said shrinkage cavity in the top portion there remains the heat retaining anent of the invention, in its original shape, said agent having been intered after the completion of the heat generation. Accordingly, there does not occur such phenomenon that the heat retaining agent after use is mixed as residue with the recovered sand after the di8 mantling of the mould and the separation of the he at retaining agent from the casting is easily. The invention will now be described more in detail by way of example. Mouldings were prepared by metal mould from an exothermic composition consisting of 25 by weight of metallic aluminium, 5 by weight of ferrous oxide, 20 by weight of ferric oxide, 5 by weight of barium nitrate, 3 by weight of sodium fluoride, 27 by weight of swollen obsidian, 5 by weight of siliceous sand, and 10 by weight of Fhenolformaldehyde resin, then the moulding. were thermally hardened to make spheres, one sphere thereof was placed at the bottom of each of the blind risers provided in the sand moulds of ductile cast iron and cast steel, the moulds were assembled, and finally the respective melts were cast, when the result was as follows Example 1 Example 2Cast material Ductile cast iron Cast steelDimension mm of heat retaining 30 456 agentBulk specific gravity of same 0.9 0.9 Dimension mm of blind riser 556 x 90 1006 x 150 Casting temperature 0c 1390 1520 No No defect in inner No defect in inner quality quality Hereupon the inner quality of the products was inspected with regard to samples cut in 10 mm thickness in the direction of center line, when any defect was not noticed for each of the samples. At that time, the same test was carried out to the blind riser not provided with a heat retaining agent of the invention but by means of sand mould only, but shrinkage cavities were found in the center of thick portion and in the neighbourhood of gate.
