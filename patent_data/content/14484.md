# Vaginal contraceptive.

## Abstract
The present invention encompasses devices which are used in the vagina to deliver spermicidal surfactants. These devices can be inserted by the user, and do not require insertion by a physician as, for example, in the case of intrauterine contraceptive devices. By virtue of their unique construction and shape, the devices herein are foldable for easy insertion. Once in position at the cervical os, the devices open to cap the os and remain in position, even during intercourse, so that access of the spermicidal surfactant source to the cervical os is not interrupted. The devices are designed to remain comfortably in the vagina during the time between menstrual periods to provide desirable, prolonged release of a spermicidal surfactant, and their contruction and shape facilitate retention therein while minimizing awareness and discomfort. An effective between period contraceptive device is thereby provided.
