## Description
ELECTRODE STRUCTURE AND METHOD OF MAKING SAME Background of the Invention This invention pertains to electrodes and, in particular, to electrodes for use with molten carbonate fuel cells. In the design of electrodes for molten carbonate fuel cells, it is essential that the electrodes be provided with carbonate constituent to provide the needed bridge with the carbonate electrolyte tile. In present structures, one technique for providing the needed carbonate constituent is to fill the electrolyte tile with excess carbonate and allow some of the excess to drain into the electrodes. The electrolyte becomes depleted in the tile and electrodes during the course of fuel cell operation and limits the useful life of the fuel cell. A storage of excess carbonate electrolyte can be provided in the electrolyte tile by increasing its thickness.However, increasing the tile thickness decreases the fuel cell output and, thus, is undesirable. To avoid having to increase the tile thickness, other practices have been used in which carbonate electrolyte is supplied directly to the electrodes. SMile this requires increased electrode thickness, such increased thickness is not detrimental to cell performance. Present techniques for adding carbonate electrolyte to the electrodes, however, are inefficient and could have an adverse effect on the electrode characteristics. In particular, carbonate electrolyte is usually added by melting the electrolyte directly into the electrode at high temperatures e.g., 6O0 C . When this is carried out using gases that the fuel electrode would normally be subjected to during fuel cell operation, wetting of the electrode is poor and inhibits electrolyte absorption. Thus, in this case, the high temperatures used can adversely affect the electrode characteristics and the degree of added electrolyte is not substantial. Moreover, while the amount of electrolyte can be increased by using a different gas during the heating, the change in gas composition can also adversely affect the electrode characteristics. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a practice for incorporating carbonate electrolyte into an electrode which does not suffer from the above disadvantages. It is a further object of the present invention to provide an improved electrode for molten carbonate fuel cells. Summary of the Invention In accordance with the principles of the present invention, the above and other objectives are realized in an electrode provided with an alkali and or alkaline earth hydroxide constituent. Such constituent is added to the electrode at room temperature and the electrode is subsequently heat treated in a carbon dioxide environment either in or out of cell to convert the hydroxide constituent to a carbonate. The resultant electrode thereby includes the desired carbonate electrolyte in an amount which can be readily controlled and selected by the initial selection and introduction of the hydroxide constituent at room temperature. In a further aspect of the present invention, a ceramic oxide constituent is also included in the electrode.This constituent also reacts with the hydroxide constituent during heating to provide a stable component which affords sintering resistance and greater carbonate retaining capability. Brief Description of the Drawings The above and other features and aspects of the present invention will become more apparent upon reading the following detailed description in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which FIG. 1 shows an electrode in accordance with the principles of the present invention and FIG. 2 illustrates a flow diagram for fabricating electrodes in accordance with the invention. Detailed Description In Fig. 1, an electrode in accordance with the principles of the invention is shown. The electrode is to be used in a fuel cell employing a carbonate electrolyte tile. The cation of the tile may be any alkaline constituent, such as, for example, Li, K, Na, etc. The electrode 1 comprises a base metallic structure preferably formed of a nickel or a nickel alloy such as, for example, Ni Co, Ni Cr,Ni and other metals, etc. In accordance with the invention, the electrode 1 is additionally filled or impregnated with an alkali and or alkaline earth hydroxide having a preselected cation component similar to the cation of the carbonate tile with which the electrode is to be used. This impregnation is carried out at room temperature by a conventional technique, such as, for example, dipping, spraying or vacuum filtration, using a solution of desired hydroxide. Depending upon the particular process used and type of electrode, a suitable organic or inorganic solvent may be used to form the hydroxide solution.Preferable solvents are water, methanol, ethanol and isopropanol. The amount of hydroxide impregnated should be such as to provide the needed contact and bridge between the electrode and the electrolyte tile during fuel cell operation and, moreover, should be such as to provide an inventory for replenishing electrolyte depleted during operation. Preferably the amount of impregnated hydroxide should be such as to result in electrolyte in the electrode which fills from 5 to 85 percent of the electrode pore volume. Subsequent to impregnating the electrode with the desired hydroxide constituent, the hydroxide is converted to carbonate electrolyte by exposure to a carbon dioxide atmosphere at a temperature above 1000C. This treatment can be carried out out of cell or in cell and provides the resultant electrode with the desired carbonate constituent make up. In a further aspect of the invention, the hydroxide added to the electrode 1, in addition to providing the carbonate electrolyte upon heat treatment, also converts any ceramic oxides or hydroxides in the electrode to stabilizing components. In accordance with this aspect of the invention, ceramic oxides, such as, for example, alumina, zirconia, iron oxide, etc., may be added by any conventional process to the electrode subsequent to sintering, these oxides then being converted by the hydroxides to the desired stablizing components. In this case, the amount of hydroxide added should be selected to be sufficient to convert the ceramic oxides, as well as to convert the hydroxide to the desired amount of carbonate electrolyte. In preferred construction, the hydroxide added to the electrode contains lithium hydroxide for reacting with the ceramic oxides. For ceramic oxides such as, for example, Or02, A1203 and We203 respective components Li2Zro3, Lilo2 and LiFeO2 having extremely high sintering resistance and stability are produced. These components, furthermore, fill the pores of the electrode and enhance the electrolyte storage and wicking properties. Preferably, the added ceramic oxide includes A1203 or A1 OH 3 so that the reaction with lithium hydroxide produces highly stable lithium aluminate. The invention will be further illustrated by the following examples and tables.Example I A nickel cobalt anode for a fuel cell was impregnated with alkali hydroxides of Li K composition similar to that of the electrolyte tile of the cell identified as Cell 149 inTable 1 below . The amount of hydroxide was equivalent to filling approximately 10 of the electrode pore volume with carbonates. The conversion of hydroxides to carbonates was performed in cell in the presence of C02 during the early cell heat up cycle. As can be seen from Table 1, the performance of the cell was 35 mV higher at 115 mA cm2 than that of a cell identified as cell 151 assembled with similar com ponents and no hydroxide treatment.

The flow diagram of the procedure followed is shown in Fig. 2 which also provides desirable porosity ranges for the initial and final anode structures and desirable weight gain ranges due to the addition of the hydroxide and ceramic oxide components.A total of four cells were assembled with the alkali hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide treatment. The anodes were first electrochemically impregnated with Al OH 3. The amount of A1 OH 3 was determined based upon a desired final electrode porosity. After impregnation, the electrodes were sprayed with an alkali hydroxide Li K OH solution in methanol. The reaction of lithium hydroxide with aluminum hydroxide produced lithium aluminate and the presence of carbon dioxide caused the conversion of the remainder of the alkali hydroxides to alkali carbonates. Performance of the fuel cells assembled with these hydroxide treated anodes are compared with cells assembled with untreated anodes in Table 2. All the cells treated with hydroxides displayed significantly better performance 40 75 mV higher at 115 mA cm2 . Also, cell endurance with the stabilized anodes was better than that of cells assembled with conventional nickel anodes. This can be attributed to the sintering resistance imparted by lithium aluminate. An additional advantage is also derived from the fine particle structure of lithium aluminate formed in the electrode pores. This fine particle structure improves the capability of the cell to withstand high differential pressures across the fuel and oxidant chambers.
