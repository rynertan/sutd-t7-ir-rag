# Insertion machines.

## Abstract
An insertion machine has a stationary table for holding inserts, and a linearly movable table for receiving and holding envelopes. The moving table jogs left or right to align the insert and envelope so that the insert may be pushed into the envelope. A parallelogram drive mechanism has a first pair of belt drives which form vertical parallel arms. As the table moves back and forth, the length of the parallel vertical drive mechanism does not change appreci ably so that the ends of the vertical arms float up and down. There is no need for sliding gears, shafts, or the like to transfer power to the table. A second pair of belts drive the vertical belts from a stationary point at a center of the side of the parallelogram which is opposite the table. The second pair of drive belts enables the lower ends of the first pair of drive belts to float up or down slightly without causing any dislocation as a result of table movement.
