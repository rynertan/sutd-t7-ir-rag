# Rod scrubber.

## Abstract
A venturi type rod scrubber 10 for effecting the cleaning of the flue gas produced as a by product of the combustion process that occurs during the course of the operation of fossil fuel firing steam generators, before the flue gas flows up the exhaust stack and is released to the atmosphere. The subject scrubber includes means 14 through which the flue gas enters the scrubber 10 and outlet means 36 through which the flue gas exists from the scrubber 10 . A first spray system 28 is suitably mounted in juxtap osed relation to the inlet means 14 so as to be operative to introduce liquid into the stream of flue gas entering the scrub ber 10 through the inlet means 14 . In alignment with but in spaced relation to the inlet means 14 , the scrubber 10 is provided with a throat region 34 i.e., a region of restricted cross section. A plurality of spaced rows of parallel rods 40 are suitably mounted within the throat region 34 so as extend substantially perpendicular to the path 12 of flow of the flue gas flowing therethrough. Interposed between the inlet means 14 and the throat region 34 , the scrubber 10 is further provided with a second spray system 38 that is also operative to introduce liquid into the flue gas stream. The first spray system 28 and the second spray system 38 mutually cooperate to effect an even distribution of liquid across the entire cross sectional area 32 of the throat region 34 that is being traversed by the flue gas as the latter flows through the scrubber 10 . This even distribution of liquid provides for an efficient removal of the particulate matter, entering the scrub ber 10 in entrainment with the flue gas. Concomitantly a reduction is achieved in the amount of particulate emission being released from the stack to the atmosphere.
