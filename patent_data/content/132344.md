# IMPROVED CATHETER BASED CARDIAC OUTPUT SENSOR

## Abstract
A flexible catheter which is useful for positioning in a blood vessel an electrical sensor used to measure cardiac out put. The catheter has a sinuously contoured portion exhibiting shape memory properties which permit it to be transluminally inserted into a blood vessel in a straightened position and re leased into the normal configuration after positioning. The sen sor is positioned relative to the contoured portion such that af ter positioning the contoured portion prevents the sensor from approaching the blood vessel wall, thereby eliminating artifacts in the output signal from the sensor.
