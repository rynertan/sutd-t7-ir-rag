# Automatic exposure device.

## Abstract
An automatic exposure device wherein the quantity of light from an exposure lamp is detected by lamp light quantity detect ing means 25 , while the reflected light from a region of a document located forwardly of a region of the document being exposed is received by density detecting means 21 , the output signal from said lamp light quantity detecting means 25 being used as an input by reference signal producing means A which produces a reference signal, the output signal from said density detecting means 21 and the reference signal being used as inputs by correcting means B which corrects the output signal from the density detecting means 21 in accordance with an increase in the quantity of light from the lamp, the output signal from said correcting means being used as an input by lamp control means C which controls conducting angle of the expo sure lamp.
