# ELECTRICALLY ERASABLE PROGRAMMABLE READ ONLY MEMORY

## Abstract
An electrically erasable programmable read only mem ory E²PROM is provided which utilizes an inhibit voltage applied to unselected word lines during writing to prevent writing in unselected rows. In the preferred embodiment, each memory cell of the E²PROM array consists of a single floating gate field effect transistor. The E²PROM of the present invention provides for row erasure and single bit writing.
