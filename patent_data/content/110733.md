# Transfer membrane apparatus.

## Abstract
Transfer membrane apparatus incorporates a number of parallel channels, each channel comprising a first conduit 5 for a first fluid formed between two closely spaced transfer membranes 6 . The outer face of each membrane is supported against a profiled plate 7 such that second conduits for a sec ond fluid are provided one on each side of the first conduit 5 between a respective membrane 6 and supporting plate 7 . The supporting plates 7 are mounted spaced apart in a stack with the double membranes between each adjacent pair of plates. The transfer membranes 6 are provided as parts of a continuous web 6 of transfer membrane material which is folded in concertina fashion. One set of folds 11 each extends around the front edge of a respective plate 7 and the other set of folds 12 each closes a respective first conduit 5 adjacent to the rear of the stack. Each first conduit 5 is sealed along a narrow zone 16 extending from a point substantially halfway along the front of the stack towards, but short of, the mem brane fold adjacent to the rear of the stack. Thus, each first conduit 5 is substantially U shaped, extending from one side of the front of the stack towards and across the rear of the stack and back to the other side of the front of the stack, or similarly W shaped. Inlet and outlet manifolds for the first fluid are provided alongside one another across the front of the stack.
