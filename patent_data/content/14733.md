# Articulated boom dipper bucket assembly for a tunnel boring machine.

## Abstract
The articulated boom dipper bucket assembly is utilized in a tunnel boring machine of the type which includes a hollow cylindrical body 12 with a front circular cutting edge 14 and a central axis on which an excavator 30 including the assem bly is positioned. The assembly includes a base 46 having a front face 48 facing axially of the machine and being mounted on a bulkhead 40 having siderails which are received in channels fixed to the body and extending parallel to the central axis. A piston and cylinder mechanism is associ ated with the bulkhead 40 for reciprocating same in a direc tion parallel to the central axis. The assembly further includes a boom 52 having one end pivotally mounted to the front face 48 of the base 46 at one side thereof and a second end positioned outwardly from the base, an elongate dipper member 58 pivotally mounted at a first inner end 60 to the second outer end 62 of the boom, and a bucket scoop 13 having an inner edge and an outer cutting edge 64 and being pivotally mounted to a second outer end of the dipper member 58 . The assembly also includes a mechanism for rotating the base on the bulkhead, a first reciprocal power mechanism 66 pivotally connected at one end to the front face 48 of the base 46 at the other side thereof and pivotally connected at the other end to the boom 52 at a point spaced from the first end thereof, a second reciprocal power mechan ism 72 pivotally connected at one end to the first end of the boom 52 and at the other end to the first end of the dipper member 58 and a third reciprocal power mechanism 80 pivotally connected at one end to the first end of the dipper member 58 and at the other end to the inner edge of the bucket scoop.
