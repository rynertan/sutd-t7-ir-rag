# PROCESS FOR MAKING A NONWOVEN FABRIC

## Abstract
A process is provided for making strong, permeable non woven fabrics having an abrasion resistant burnished surface. The process involves providing a lightly consolidated or weakly bonded web of thermoplastic synthetic organic fibers, needle punching the web, heating a surface of the needled web, and burnishing the heated surface with a rotating, smooth surfaced metal roll, which preferably simultaneously cools the web surface.
