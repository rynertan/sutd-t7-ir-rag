# APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR ENHANCED PSYCHOACOUSTIC IMAGERY

## Abstract
Enhanced pyschoacoustic imagery is achieved in an au dio signal processing circuit for processing plural channels of related audio signals. Asymmetric bi directional audio si gnal cross feed is established between first and second au dio signal processing channels, for example. The cross fed signal components are combined in an out of phase rela tionship with respect to related audio signals already pass ing through a given channel. The asymmetry is designed so as to complement the asymmetry which is believed to be present in a listener s brain processing of perceived acous tic signals due to the naturally occurring left or right half brain dominance of the listener. In other embodiments both symmetric and asymmetric, cross feeding is limited to si gnal components below a predetermined frequency.
