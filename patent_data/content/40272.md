# A demodulator system including a tunable discriminator suitable for use in a Secam television receiver.

## Abstract
A demodulating system to be utilized in Secam television receivers for deriving the R Y and B Y chrominance informa tion signals from the frequency modulated Secam RF subcar rier frequencies without the necessity for precise and stable tuned circuits. The demodulating system includes a single discriminator 66 having an electronically tunable center fre quency, a remodulator 42 , for producing a reference fre quency amplitude modulated by the chrominance informa tion signals which are supplied to a commutator as known, and a feedback circuit coupled between the discriminator and remodulator. The discriminator is selectively tuned to a refer ence center frequency during each picture line clamp period to produce a zero level output signal. During the chrominance information portion of each line, the center frequency of the discriminator is alternately offset by first and second control signals to center frequencies coinciding with the two refer ence frequencies to produce a zero output level whenever the Secam signals are at the respective RF subcarrier frequencies. The feedback circuit ensures that the zero output levels obtained during the information carrying portion of each line is identical with the zero output level set during the clamp period.
