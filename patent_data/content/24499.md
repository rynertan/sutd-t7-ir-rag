# Biaxially oriented wholly aromatic polyester film and process for producing same.

## Abstract
A melt molded film of a wholly aromatic polyester, said film having in its plane two perpendicularly crossing direc tions in each of which the Young s modulus and strength of the film at 25 C are at least about 200 kg mm² and at least about 5 kg mm² respectively, the product of the Young s moduli of the film in the two directions being at least 8 x 10⁴ kg mm² ². and said wholly aromatic polyester being sub stantially linear, having a melt viscosity at about its melting point of at least about 10000 poises, and being composed substantially of recurring units derived from p hydroxybenzoic acid, recurring units dervied from a m or p oriented aromatic dicarboxylic acid and recurring units der vied from a m or p oriented aromatic dihyxroxy compound, the proportion of said recurring units derived from p hydroxybenzoic acid being about 30 to about 70 mole based on the entire recurring units. This invention provides also a process for producing said film which comprises heat ing aforesaid wholly aromatic polyester to a temperature above a point at which the polyester is extrusion moldable and extruding the heated polyester through a slit and either orienting the extruded film in the extruding direction or machine direction and a direction perpendicular thereto while the heated aromatic polyester resides in said slit or after it has left the slit but before it is cooled to the glass transition temp erature of the polyester, or ii orienting the extruded film substantially only in the extruding direction or machine direc tion while the polyester heated at said temperature resides in the slit, or after it has left the slit but before it is cooled to the glass transition temperature of the polyester, and then re heating the film to a temperature higher than the glass transi tion temperature of the polyester, and orienting the film in the direction perpendicular to the machine direction.
