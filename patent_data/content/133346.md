# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR SECONDARY FERMENTATION AND VESSEL CONTAINING BEVERAGE

## Abstract
Where a beverage, e.g. beer, is pressurized by conventio nal techniques in a dispensing vessel e.g. a barrel or a bottle by secondary fermentation in that container using yeast, it is necessary to ensure that the yeast settles properly before the beverage is dispensed. This tends to restrict the usage of such beverage to places providing the required stable environment for settling to take place. In the present invention, the yeast is restrained, so that it cannot mix freely in the beverage but still has sufficient contact with the beverage for the fermentation to proceed. Such restraining can be achieved either by en trapping the yeast within a porous or partly porous container 3 immersed in the beverage, the porosity being such as to allow passage of the beverage but not the yeast particles, or by immobilising the yeast on a substrate 3 free or fixed within the vessel 2, 22 .
