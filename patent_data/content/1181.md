# Frictional engagement system incorporating an aluminium friction surface.

## Abstract
A frictional engagement system, particularly a brake system, comprises two friction surfaces, one of which is composed of aluminium, the other of which is formed of a lining material which incorporates sodium fluoride or cryolite. When the system is subjected to repeated frictional engagement, as for example braking actions, the additive of the lining reacts with a surface layer of the aluminium friction surface to form a tenacious, wear resistant layer thereof. The additive, upon further engagement serves to maintain the wear resistant layer as fresh aluminium is exposed during normal wear of friction surface over its useful life.
