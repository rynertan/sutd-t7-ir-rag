# Rotating head type magnetic record reproduce apparatus.

## Abstract
The rotating head PCM record reproduce apparatus has record and reproduce heads 33, 35, 34, 36 of which the reproduce heads 34, 36 are disposed to scan the recorded track formed by the record heads 33, 35 , with a delay of a rotation angle of 90 thereby reading immediately after re cording, and circuits 2, 3, 25, 31 for converting analog sig nal to digital signal, and for compressing the timebase of the digital signal, the compressed digital signal being sup plied to the record heads 33, 35 so that no signal is sup plied to the record head while the reproduce heads 34, 36 are reading the recorded signal.
