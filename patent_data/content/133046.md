# A METHOD OF INTRODUCING A DONOR DNA INTO A STRAIN OF THE GENUS LACTOBACILLUS

## Abstract
A method of introducing a donor DNA into a strain belonging to the genus Lactobacillus, comprises preparing spheroplasts of the strain, encapsulating donor DNA within liposomes to obtain DNA encapsulating liposomes, and allowing the DNA encapsulating liposomes to fuse with the spheroplasts in the presence of a fusion inducing agent such as polyethylene glycol. The donor DNA may be provided in the form of recombinant DNA molecules prepared as a vector having inserted therein suitable phage DNA, plasmid DNA or heterogenic DNA retaining useful genetic information. Exam ples of the phage DNA include the DNA of the virulent phage J1 and the DNA of the temperate phage FSW selectively retained in the genus L. casei.
