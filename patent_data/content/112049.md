When t butyl hypochlorite is employed, it is preferred that the agent is as pure as possible, preferably distilled or freshly prepared. The function of the halogenating agent employed in the process of the present invention is to halogenate the nitrogen atom attached to the ss lactam ring. The halogenated intermediate is then dehydrohalogenated to produce the acylimine intermediate of structure IA .The halogenation reaction is facilitated by a base. It is therefore preferable to employ the halogenating agent in the presence of a strong base. Suitable strong bases include sodium hydride, lithium di isopropylamide, phenyl lithium and butyl lithium.Alternatively it is convenient to employ as a strong base, a compound which can also provide the desired nucleophilic agent for the process, such as for example an alkali metal alkoxide.As the halogenation step of the present process to produce the acylimine intermediate IA occurs prior to the nucleophilic addition thereto, the order of addition of the reagents to the lactam starting material may be the halogenating agent followed by the nucleophilic reagent. However, in order to avoid or reduce unwanted side reactions of the halogenating agent, the nucleophilic reagent may be added first, so that as the halogenating agent is added, the acylimine intermediate IA is produced and reacts in situ with the nucleophilic reagent present. This mode of carrying out the reaction is particularly advantageous when the nucleophilic reagent is a strong base and can be used as the base to facilitate the action of the halogenating agent. The solvent employed in the process of this invention should be an anhydrous solvent in which the starting materials are soluble. Suitable solvents for the process include methanol, ethanol, methylene dichloride, dimethylformamide, dimethacetamide, dimethoxyethane, tetrahydrofuran, dioxan, methyl acetate, ethyl acetate and isopropyl acetate or mixtures of any such solvents. The process is conveniently carried out at low temperature, suitably less than 0 C. The preferred temperature for a particular reaction will depend on the nature of the ss lactam starting material and the reagents employed. The process is carried out for a short period, for example up to 60 minutes, conveniently less than 30 minutes, suitably from 3 to 10 minutes. The reaction mixture is then conveniently quenched by acidification. Suitable acids which may be used to quench the reaction are concentrated mineral acids, such as concentrated sulphuric acid, and low molecular weight alkyl carboxylic acids such as formic acid, acetic acid or propionic acid, optionally in the presence of a tri alkylphosphite. The product of the process may be isolated by conventional methods such as solvent extraction, chromatographic separation in particular ion exchange chromatography, precipitation, freeze drying and spray drying techniques. Suitable solvents for the precipitation of the product include non polar solvents such as methyl isobutyl ketone, isopropyl ether, methylene dichloride and diethyl ether. In a further preferred aspect of this invention, there is provided a process for the preparation of an antibacterially active ss lactam derivative of formula V or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof EMI10.1 wherein R4 is phenyl, p hydroxyphenyl or 2 or 3 thienyl which process comprises reacting a salt of a compound of formula VI EMI10.2 where Rx is a carboxy blocking group with a halogenating agent and a source of methoxide ions,CH30 and if Rx is other than a salt, converting the group Co2RX to a free acid or salt. The group R4 in formula V and VI is preferably phenyl or thienyl, especially 3 thienyl. In this aspect of the invention, a preferred halogenating agent is again t butyl hypochlorite.Preferably the methoxide ions are present prior to, or at the same time as, the halogenating agent so that they can act as a base to remove a proton and thereby facilitate the halogenation. Preferably therefore an additional equivalent of methoxide is employed so that it can act as a base and as a nucleophilic reagent. Suitably the source of methoxide ions is an alkali metal alkoxide such as sodium or lithium methoxide.Alternatively, methanol may be employed in the presence of a strong base such as sodium hydride or lithium di isopropylamide. A preferred source of methoxide ions is lithium methoxide. If sodium methoxide is employed, it is also advantageous to employ a small amount of lithium chloride. The compound of formula VI may be present in the form of a disalt i.e. Rx represents a salting ion.Suitable salting ions include sodium, potassium, lithium, calcium, aluminium, magnesium,and dicyclohexylamine, preferably the di sodium salt. Alternatively the di acid corresponding to compound VI , i.e. Rx H, may be employed, or a mono salt thereof together with an additional 2 or 1 equivalent respectively of methoxide, as that amount is initially consumed as a base to produce the disalt VI . In the methoxylation aspect of this invention, i.e. the formation of compound V from VI , it is convenient to employ methanol as a solvent. Preferred solvents for this aspect of the invention include dimethylformamide and methanol, in particular a mixture of the two, optionally in the presence of tetrahydrofuran or methyl acetate. A preferred solvent system is dimethylformamide methanol methyl acetate.Preferred proportions of dimethylformamide to methanol are from 3 1 to 6 1, preferably 5 1. The starting material of formula VI is preferably present at a concentration of 5 7 of the reaction solution. For the preparation of compounds of formula V , a suitable temperature is from 100oC to 50 C, advantageously from 80 C to 60 C. When such low temperature reactions are carried out, it is preferable to pre cool the solutions of reagents before they added to the reaction mixture. A preferred reaction time is from 5 to 15 minutes.
