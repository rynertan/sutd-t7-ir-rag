# Process for producing benzophenone azines.

## Abstract
A process for producing a benzophenone azine compris es a oxidizing a benzophenone imine with molecular oxygen in the presence of at least one copper halide catalyst to produce a benzophenone zine, b contacting the oxida tion reaction mixture obtained in the step a with an aqueous solution containing at least one of a mineral acid, an inorganic halide, an ammonium salt or ammonia to extract and remove the catalyst, and c contacting the catalyst containing aqueous solution obtained in the step b with a benzophenone imine to extract the catalyst, and recycling the catalyst containing benzophenone imine solution obtained to the step a in the form of a benzophenone imine solution.
