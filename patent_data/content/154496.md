# Microstrip circuits.

## Abstract
Impedance adjusting elements for a microstrip circuit employing a signal transmission line 6 connected to an active circuit element and at least one impedance matching element, such as a parallel connected open ended stub 11 , are formed of one or more wire elements 21, 22 arranged in proximity to the transmission line 6 and the open ended stub 11 and connected at one end to a ground plane on a side of a substrate opposite to the transmission line 6 . The free ends of the wire elements 21, 22 can be freely moved, thereby to adjust the spacing of the wire elements from the signal transmission line 6 and open ended stub 11 and adjust the angle of intersection of the wire elements and the signal transmission line and open ended stub, so that the effective impedances of the circuit can be controlled.
