# Securing means.

## Abstract
Securing means for use in a drive coupling between rotary drive means and a tang ended shaft of the pump of a fuel injection system, the securing means comprising a block 42 which has a a hole or recess 45 in it which provides mutually inwardly facing surfaces 62 and 64 for engaging the opposite sides 66 and 68 of such a tang end, or two parts of an adaptor between which such a tang end is held, b two laterally displaced screwthreaded bores 76 and 78 extending from opposite outer sides of the block to the hole or recess 45 , opening out respectively on the said mutually inwardly facing surfaces 62 and 64 , c two slots 86 and 88 each of which extends, in a plane which is transverse in relation to the respective screwthreaded bore, from a side of the block, at which the slot is open, across the screwthreaded bore and beyond it, to a closed end of the slot, stresses in the material of the block tending to shift material of the block on one side of the slot relative to the material of the block on the other side of the slot, and d two fixing screws 90 and 92 which extend respectively through the two screwthreaded bores 76 and 78 on both sides of the respective slot so that rotation of the screws 90 and 92 is resisted by the material of the block.
