# AC voltage stabilizer easily convertible into uninterruptible power supply UPS .

## Abstract
An electronic AC voltage stabilizer is described using a class B amplifier output stage which is fed by a full wave rectified sinewave voltage. The input voltage to the phase inverter of the class B amplifier output stage is kept in phase with aforesaid sinewave voltage, which causes the power losses over the output stage to be very low. As compared to other electronic AC stabilizers the apparatus according to the invention offers high efficiency and simplicity. The AC stabilizer can easily be converted into a true UPS by adding a battery which by intermediary of a battery interface connects the conditioned battery voltage to the push pull amplifier output stage when the network fails.
