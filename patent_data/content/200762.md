## Description
The present invention relates to devices which can be employed to effect a flow of air or other gaseous fluid from the ceiling, upper boundary or upper wall hereinafter referred to as a ceiling of a room or other confined area or enclosure having determinate vertical and horizontal dimensions into that area in a specified pattern. Furthermore, the gaseous fluid is introduced into the confined area with minimum turbulence and, also, without aspiration i.e., the gaseous fluid is introduced in such a manner that gaseous fluids and suspended particulates in the confined area are not drawn back up into the distribution device and mixed with the gaseous fluid introduced into the confined area. Typically, the gaseous fluid will be introduced into the confined area serviced by a distribution device in a pattern which will result in a uniform distribution over that dimension of the enclosure spanned by the distribution device. This is not essential, however, non uniform flow patterns can equally well be supplied if dictated by the user s requirements. Among the advantages of our novel gaseous fluid typically air distribution devices, in addition to those just specified, are that they are efficient because the pressure drop across the unit is low, they are easily attached to a T grid and similar ceiling suspension systems, and they can be combined, without modification, with terminal high efficiency, e.g., HEPA, filters see U.S. Patent No. 4,175,936 issued November 27, 1979, to Lough et al for DIFFUSER WITH REPLACEABLE FILTER in applications in which an ultraclean air supply, for example is required. Applications of the present invention are legion. Among those of immediate importance are the supply of air to rooms where dust suppression is important. Such rooms include those in which pharmaceutical grinding, milling, and tableting operations are carried out and rooms in which laboratory animals are housed for experimental purposes. Electronic laboratories and assembly rooms and other high tech manufacturing facilities are examples of other applications in which the principles of our invention can be employed to advantage. In the foregoing and other environments, HEPA and other high efficiency filters are utilized to insure an ultraclean air supply. Our invention can be employed in such cases to eliminate the narrow, ceiling to floor, columnar flow of air that would otherwise exist. Other applications of our invention will readily occur to those skilled in the arts to which this invention relates. The advantages of the invention identified above are accomplished in an efficient, straightforward manner with mechanically simple devices which can be manufactured at relatively low cost. Generally, these devices are coupled to a component or sub assembly with structure which defines an inlet plenum for the gases being furnished by the device and a supply duct communicating with the inlet plenum which may house a HEPA or other high efficiency filter. Our novel device, associated with that sub assembly, includes a perforate outlet member preferably of generally semi elliptical cross sectional configuration. The device effects a patterned flow of the gaseous fluid into the room or other confined area serviced by it. That goal is furthered by flow directing vanes which proportion the flow of fluid from the inlet plenum among the several laterally related segments of an outlet plenum bounded by the perforate member and defined by the vanes. Preferably, the latter are made adjustable so that the pattern of fluid flow effected by the device can be varied without structural alteration of it. Finally, the flow distribution device may also include an appropriate arrangement for suspending it from, or in a specified relationship to, the ceiling of the enclosure it services. T bar lay in systems are only one type of suspension arrangement that can be employed for our purposes. As will be apparent from the foregoing, the devices of the present invention can, at least at the present time, probably be most gainfully employed to supply air of one quality or another to a room designed for any one of a variety of purposes. Other devices designed for this same general purpose have of course been heretofore proposed. Those known to and believed by us to most resemble the devices we have invented are disclosed in U.S. Patents Nos. 2,504,472 issued April 18, 1960, to Van Alsburg for AIR DISTRIBUTOR 2,576,905 issued November 27, 1961 to Labus for ADJUSTABLE AIR DISTRIBUTOR 2,848,935 issued August 26, 1968, to Demuth for AIR DISTRIBUTING DEVICES 3,033,097 issued May 8, 1962, to Phillips for AIR DISTRIBUTION CONTROL OUTLET 3,854,386 issued December 17, 1974, to Beddrick for AIR DIFFUSION 4,175,936 issued November 17, 1979, to Lough et al for DIFFUSOR WITH REPLACEABLE FILTER 4,188,862 issued February 19, 1980, to Douglas III for REGSITER ASSEMBLY 4,253,384 issued March 3, 1981 to Schmidt et al for VENTILATING AND AIR CONDITIONING ARRANGEMENT and 4,276,818 issued July 7, 1981, to Makara et al for AIR DISTRIBUTOR. Only a brief perusal of the foregoing patents will make it obvious to those skilled in the arts dealing with our invention that the devices with which we are concerned are considerably different from any disclosed in the above listed patents. There is no suggestion that any of the patented devices have the capability of introducing a gaseous fluid into a serviced enclosure from the ceiling thereof in a specified, typically uniform, pattern that the fluid can be introduced into the enclosure with minimal turbulence or that the fluid can be introduced without drawing air or other gaseous fluid or suspended particulate material in the room back into the fluid supplied by the distribution device. Furthermore, the foregoing flow distribution devices are, with one or two possible exceptions, considerably more complicated than those novel devices we have invented. Still other devices for effecting a flow of air or other gaseous fluid into a room or other enclosure serviced by the device are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,358,577 issued December 19, 1967, to Thomson in British patent application No. 2120778 filed by Horworth Air Engineering Ltd. and published December 7, 1983 and in 24 HEATING 193, January, 1962, John D. Troup Ltd., London, England, pages 3 6. Thomson discloses a wall mounted register with a flat, perforate outlet plate and deflecting louvers which are configured to minimize turbulence in air passing therebetween. British application No. 2120778 is concerned with an air conditioning system outlet device which is intended to prevent entrainment of air in an enclosure being serviced and the mixing of that air with air introduced through the outlet device. Various configurations of outlet device are shown all direct the fluid discharged from the device along paths oriented at acute angles to the ceiling of the enclosure being serviced or directly toward the floor of that enclosure. To the extent that it is relevant, the above cited excerpt from HEATING is concerned with a secondary diffuser for a dust free environment. This diffuser is a curved, perforated plate and it is designed to produce downward air movement , the air being extracted through grills at floor level. The outlet device disclosed in British application No. 2120778 and the secondary diffuser disclosed in HEATING are both of the vaneless type. From the foregoing, it will be apparent to those to whom this specification is addressed that the primary object of our invention resides in the provision of novel, improved devices for effecting the flow of air or other gaseous fluid into a room or other enclosure from the ceiling or other upper boundary or wall of that enclosure. Other important, but more specific, objects of our invention reside in the provision of devices as defined in the preceding object which are capable of effecting the flow of a gaseous fluid into the enclosure in a specified pattern can be readily programmed to vary the flow pattern without structurally altering the device which are capable of effecting the flow of gaseous fluid into the enclosure with minimal turbulence which are capable of so effecting the flow of fluid into the room or other confined area or enclosure that air or other fluid or suspended particulate material in that room or enclosure is not drawn back into and mixed with that being supplied by the device which can be employed, without modification, with high efficiency filters such as those of the HEPA type in applications where air with exacting requirements is specified which are characterized by low pressure drops and corresponding energy savings and which are capable of accomplishing the just enumerated objects efficiently by way of devices which are structurally and mechanically uncomplicated and can be supplied at a relatively low cost. In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a device for effecting a non aspirated flow of air or other gaseous fluid into a room or other enclosure having a ceiling and determined vertical and horizontal dimensions with minimal turbulence, said device comprising a perforate outlet member, end walls at the opposite ends of said perforate outlet member and a plurality of vanes housed in said perforate outlet member, said device being characterized in that said outlet member is mounted so as to depend from said ceiling and has a continuously curved cross sectional configuration providing a horizontally oriented, curved bottom wall portion which transitions into curved, generally vertical, side wall portions, by perforations through said side wall portions so located that a selected portion of the gaseous fluid flowing into said enclosure through said outlet member flows therefrom in paths which are generally parallel to said ceiling by perforations through said bottom and side wall portions which are so located as to direct the rest of that gaseous fluid flowing through said perforate outlet member into said enclosure in paths inclined downwardly at selected angles relative to said first mentioned paths and in that said vanes extend downwardly through said perforate outlet member and apportion the flow of the fluid flowing through said outlet member among segments of the perforate outlet member delineated by the lower edges of said vanes to thereby effect a particularly patterned flow of fluid into said enclosure. Still other novel features of our invention will be apparent to the reader from the foregoing, from the appended claims, and from the ensuing detailed description and discussion taken in conjunction with the drawing. In the drawing Figure 1 is a generally pictorial view of a device or unit which includes a gaseous fluid flow effecting or distribution assembly constructed in accord with and embodying the principles of the present invention this view also pictorially shows a sub assembly which may include a HEPA or other high efficiency filter for supplying the gaseous fluid to the flow effecting assembly and the relationship between the assembly of the present invention and the ceiling or upper wall of the enclosure serviced by it Figure 2 is a generally perspective view of the flow effecting assembly shown in Figure 1 and utilized to effect a patterned flow of gaseous fluid into the enclosure Figure 3 is a section through the flow effecting assembly of Figure 2, taken substantially along line 3 3 of the latter figure and Figure 4 is a pictorial view of an installation which has a gaseous fluid flow effecting or distributing assembly in accord with the principles of our invention, that assembly extending the length of the enclosure in which it is installed. Referring now to the drawing, Figure 1 depicts, pictorially, a unit 10 for effecting a patterned flow of gaseous fluid hereinafter referred to as air or clean air for the sake of convenience into a room or enclosure 12 which has determinate dimensions and an upper wall or ceiling 14. Unit 10 is designed to effect a single pass of the fluid it supplies through enclosure 12. To further this objective outlet registers not shown through which the supplied fluid can be exhausted will typically be provided at the lower edges of the enclosure. In that embodiment of our invention illustrated in Figure 1, ceiling 14 is of the conventional suspended type in which tiles 16 are supported by T bars 18, the latter being in turn supported by joists or other load bearing structural members not shown . Unit 10 may, in this exemplary application of our invention, be supported from, and located between, adjacent T bars 18 of the ceiling s grid structure. Referring still to Figure 1, unit 10 includes an upper gaseous fluid inlet sub assembly 20 and a lower, outlet and flow directing assembly 22 constructed in accord with the principles of the present invention. The typical inlet sub assembly 20 which could contain a HEPA type filter includes a rectangularly configured, boxlike structure 24 which has a horizontal top wall 26 and, depending therefrom, two side walls 27 and 28 and two end walls only one of which, 30, is shown . The bottom 32 of this structure is perforated and the structure defines an inlet plenum 34 for the gaseous fluids supplied to enclosure 12. These fluids are delivered to the inlet plenum 34 through a supply duct 36 with an outlet 36a see Fig. 1 which communicates with the interior of the plenum through the top wall 26 of the plenum defining structure. As discussed above, unit 10 is capable of effecting a flow of a gaseous fluid supplied by it into enclosure 12 without back flow of air or other gaseous fluids or suspended particulates into the enclosure without aspiration of extant fluids and suspended particles into the fluid flowing into the enclosure from unit 10 and in a pattern meeting the user s requirements. To further these objectives a preferably adjustable perforate baffle 37 is installed in plenum 34. Typically, baffle 37 will be a disk of approximately the same dimensions as gaseous fluid supply duct 36 and it will be spaced below, and parallel to, the upper wall 26 of the plenum defining structure 24. In the exemplary application of our invention under discussion, unit 10 is supported from the T bars 18 of ceiling system 14 as was mentioned above. More particularly, the lower edges of the side walls 27 and 28 of the inlet plenum defining structure 24 rest on the lower flanges of the horizontal, suspended ceiling system T bars 18 there are also spaced apart, parallel T bars located at right angles to those just mentioned. The end walls of the inlet plenum defining structure are similarly supported from the horizontal flanges of those T bars. One such T bar is identified in Figure 1 by reference character 39, and its lower flange is identified by reference character 40. Referring now to Figures 2 and 3, in addition to Figure 1, the patterned flow fluid distributing assembly 22 constructed in accord with the principles of the present invention and incorporated in unit 10 includes a perforate outlet member 42 which has a generally semielliptical configuration provided, as shown in Figs. 1 3, by a horizontally oriented, curved bottom wall portion 42a which transitions into curved, generally vertical side wall portions 42b and 42c arcuately sectioned vanes 44a...44f disposed in two arrays 44 1 and 44 2 in mirror image relationships on opposite sides of the vertical centerplane 45 of unit 10 and plates 46 and 48 at the opposite ends of perforate outlet member 42 which cooperate with the latter to define an outlet plenum 49 for the gaseous fluid supplied to enclosure 12. In the exemplary embodiment of the invention shown in the drawing, outlet assembly 22 is coupled to the associated, upper, T bar assembly 18 by hinges 50, 51 and 52 and a latch 58 shown in Fig. 3 and described below. In the embodiments of the invention illustrated in the drawing, vanes 44a...44f extend from end to end of the elongatd, perforate, outlet member 42 and, vertically, from a horizontal location 60 coincident with the upper edges of that member downwardly into juxtaposition with the member where each vane terminates in a lower edge 61. These vanes can be fixed to the end walls 46 and 48 of the outlet member 42 in any desired fashion to proportion the fluid flowing into outlet plenum 49 from the inlet plenum 34 between those several lateral segments of the outlet plenum identified by reference characters 62a...62g in Fig. 1. For example, rivets, spot welds, etc., can be employed for this purpose. This manner of mounting the vanes is the simplest and least expensive and it is accordingly employed where flexibility in the fluid distribution pattern is not required. In circumstances where that feature is of import, in contrast, adjustable vanes are employed so that the flow pattern of fluid from outlet plenum 49 can be selectively so varied among those several segments 62a...62g of that plenum through outlet member 42 into enclosure 12 as to meet the user s requirements. Referring now specifically to Fig. 3, vanes 44a...44f can, in their adjustable mode, be supported from the end walls 46 and 48 of the fluid outlet assembly 22 by pivot members 66 which can be rivets, screws, etc. For structural purposes, a depending, integral flange such as that identified by reference character 68 in Figure 3 will be formed at the upper edge 69 of each end wall 46 and 48 a bracket 70 only one shown will be spot welded or otherwise fixed to each end of each vane at the upper edge 71 thereof and a pivot member 66 will be extended through the bracket, flange, and end wall member proper at both ends of each vane. Rotation of each vane 44a...44f about the horizontal, longitudinally extending axis 72 afforded by the pivot member 66 supporting that vane from lower assembly end walls 46 and 48 is provided by adjusting assemblies 73 at the two ends of each vane. For the sake of simplicity, only one of these has been shown. Referring still to Figure 3, exemplary adjusting mechanism 73 includes a bracket 74, a threaded adjusting member 76, which can be reached by an adjusting tool such as as an Allen wrench, for example, through an opening 77 in perforate outlet member 42 a tinnerman clip 78, and an internally threaded retainer 80. The latter allows threaded adjusting member 76 to rotate relative to the flange 82 of the bracket 74 through which it extends but otherwise keeps that member from moving relative to the flange 82 of the bracket 74 through which it extends but otherwise keeps that member from moving relative to the flange. Retainer 78 is riveted or otherwise fixed to the associated vane 44f in Figure 3 . The resilience inherent in the retainer and the lower edge portion 84 of the vane and the tendency for these ends of the vane and the retainer to move relative to each other as the adjusting member 76 is rotated effect a friction lock. This insures that the adjusting member will remain in the position to which it is rotated in order to pivot the associated vane to the position necessary to effect that flow of gaseous fluid through outlet member 42 consistent with the user s requirements. Referring now to the several Figs. 1 3 of the drawing, patterned flow effecting outlet member 42 can be attached to the end members 46 and 48 of the illustrated flow device assembly 22 by riveting or otherwise fastening the perforate outlet member to flanges extending longitudinally from those end members. One of those flanges shown in Fig. 3 is identified by reference character 86. The outlet member 42 extends from end to end of flow device assembly 22 and has a generally semielliptical cross sectional configuration. As best shown in Figs. 1 and 3, the upper edge portions 88 of the outlet member side walls 42a and 42b curve and are inclined from the vertical back toward the longitudinal centerplane 45 of the flow device assembly 22, as is shown in each of Figs. 1 3. This insures that selected portions of the gaseous fluid exiting from outlet plenum 49 into enclosure 12 will flow parallel to the ceiling l4 of the enclosure as shown by flow lines 90 and 92 in Fig. 1. In most instances, a uniform distribution of the gaseous fluid will be wanted in enclosure 12. The just described flow of the fluid parallel to ceiling 14 is a requisite to uniform, and other patterned, distributions of the gaseous fluid in the enclosure. The remainder of the air is directed into enclosure 12 through outlet member 42 from outlet plenum segments 62a g in paths 93a g which, like those identified by arrows 90 and 92, extend from end to end of unit assembly 22. The paths taken by these air streams vary from 0 to 90 degrees relative to the longitudinally extending vertical centerplane 45 of unit 10. A unit such as that shown in Fig. 1 will, in a typical application of our invention, be 24 inches wide and 48 inches long, making it compatible with a conventional suspended ceiling system. This is not requisite, however and the unit may instead be dimensioned as required by particular application of the invention. In this respect, the unit may on occasion be advantageously made coextensive in length with the enclosure it services. This eliminates those minor variations in the wanted, patterned distribution of air which might otherwise exist because of the lack of symmetry at the ends of the unit. An installation of this character is illustrated in Figure 4. The gaseous fluid distributing unit is identified by reference character 98 and the enclosure in which it is installed by reference character 100. The latter has ceiling 102 adjacent which unit 98 is mounted. Typically, a unit as shown in Figure 1 3 or 4, and with the dimensions identified above, will be capable of supplying a gaseous fluid with minimal turbulence to and no aspiration to enclose 12 at an extraordinarily high rate. To ensure against turbulence, perforate outlet member 42 will, in such units, again typically, have a uniformly patterned set of perforations 104 ranging in size from 1 16 to 3 16 inch and the cumulative area of perforations relative to the total area of the outlet member 42 will range from 8 to 40 percent. Perforations 104 will typically be circular. This configuration is not essential, however and rectangular or other shaped slots or perforations can instead be employed, depending upon the exigencies of the particular application to which our invention is put. As indicated above, the semielliptical configuration of the outlet member is also important as is the inward curvature of that member at its upper edges toward the longitudinal centerplane 45 of the unit. In the exemplary 24 inch wide units under consideration, those edges have an initial curvature of two inches transitioning through a four inch curve into the more elliptical, shallower curve spanning the major portion of the unit. Assembly 22 can be fabricated from a wide variety of sheet materials. One is aluminum which may be anodized. Other suitable materials include stainless and galvanized steels and various plastics.
