# Filled arylene sulfide polymer compositions.

## Abstract
A filled arylene sulfide polymer composition is provided in which at least 30 weight percent of the total composition is arylene sulfide polymer, up to about 65 weight percent of the total composition is filler material chosen from glass filler and at least one mineral filler and containing a property modifying amount of up to about 12 weight percent of the total composition of a solid, resinous butadiene styrene block copolymer having the vinyl content in the range of about 10 to about 14 percent based on the polybutadiene segment of the copolymer. The physical characteristics of a filled arylene sulfide polymer composition containing at least 30 weight percent of the total composition of arylene sulfide polymer and up to about 65 weight percent of the total composition of fillers comprising glass fibers and at least one mineral filler are improved by the addition of a property modifying amount of up to about 12 weight percent of the total composition of a solid, resinous butadiene styrene block copolymer having a vinyl content in the range of about 10 to about 14 percent based on the polybutadiene segment of the copolymer.
