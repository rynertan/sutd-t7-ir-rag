# COMPARTMENTED FLEXIBLE SOLUTION CONTAINER

## Abstract
A compartmented and collapsible container for sterile components which has at least two separate compartments for different components, yet will permit the intermixing of the components upon the release of a clamping member engaging an intermediate passageway which interconnects the compartments. The compartmented container is specifi cally constructed for use with two solutions which are nor mally incompatible over an extended period of time when mixed. The container herein described permits the two incompatible solutions to be sterilized in a disposable, flexible container. At the time of usage, the two materials can be readily intermixed in the same container and administered therefrom, such as with the usual intravenous administation equipment. An important feature of the container is a clamp member which can seal the interconnecting passageway in the container in a unique manner as well as a container with apertures to accommodate the clamp both during its opera tive and inoperative modes.
