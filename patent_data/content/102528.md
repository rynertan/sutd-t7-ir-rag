# VOLTAGE TO PRESSURE TRANSDUCER

## Abstract
A pressure control system for maintaining pressure of a gas within a container at a preselected value. The volume within the container is connected to a source of pressurized gas. An external portion of the container is spherical shaped and has an orifice formed therein through which gas is exhausted from the volume. A piezoelectric bender bimorph has a portion thereof adjacent the exhaust orifice. Feedback means connected between the volume and the piezoelectric bender bimorph function to vary the position of the bimorph relative to the exhaust orifice to maintain pressure within the container at preselected value.
