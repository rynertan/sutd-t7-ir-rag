# An interface device among one or more computers and sensors and actuators in control apparatuses.

## Abstract
The object of this invention is an interface device 1 for control apparatuses formed by sensors 44 of the antitheft type, applied, for instance, in different places which are to be watched as doors, windows and the like, or of another type such as anti fire, anti flooding and the like, and one or more computers 10A 10B which receive the information from said sensors, elaborate said information according to prede termined programs loaded into said computers, and then send to the interface 1 the necessary instructions for activa ting the actuators 45 of the physical operations of the con trol. Said device 1 includes an intelligent unit formed by a central processing unit 2 having permanent and volatile memories 3 and parallel serial conversion circuits 8 for serial communication with the computer 10A and with pos sible accessory management devices 9 , parallel input output circuits 4 5 6 7 , in combination with an interface unit in which the number of the contacts for the control func tions and the number of the digital optoisolated inputs for the logic states of the sensors may be selected according to the special purposes required.
