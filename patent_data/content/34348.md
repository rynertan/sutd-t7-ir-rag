# Method of and apparatus for recovering tantalum from tantalum containing scrap.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a method and an apparatus for recovering tantalum from tantalum containing scrap, which comprises dissolving tantalum containing scrap in an inorganic acid, bringing the resultant solution 1 into contact with an anionic exchange resin 3, 4, 5, 6 , followed by washing said enionic exchange resin with a solution 16 of hydrofluoric acid or a strongly acidic medium containing hydrofluoric acid, and then washing the resin with an aqueous tantalum eluting solution 17 of a mixture composed of hydrofluoric acid, aqueous anmonia and an anmonium salt.
