# IMPACT SENSOR

## Abstract
An impact sensor has a housing with an inner chamber. A first electrical contact extends from the housing and has a contact portion disposed in the chamber. A second electrical contact extends from the housing and is spaced from the first contact and has an aperture in the housing surrounding the contact portion. An insulating material is disposed between the contacts for maintaining electrical isolation of the contacts. A plastically deformed conductive arcuate spring is in electrical connection with the second contact along generally the periphery of the aperture and has a first position arched away from the contact portion and a second position arched toward and engaged with the contact portion for thereby establishing electrical connection between the contacts. A mass is movably positioned in the chamber and is engageable with the spring for shifting the spring from the first to the second position upon detection of a collision.
