# Thermal insulation of nuclear reactor.

## Abstract
A nuclear reactor having a remotely removable and replaceable thermal insulating shield 23 for the head 15 of the reactor vessel 13 . The thermal insulating shield includes a vertical frame 25 of insulating material of polygonal transverse cross sec tion encircling the head and top panels 27a of insulating material mounted on the top of the frame 25 and being pivotal, by remote actuation, between a horizontal position and a retracted position which may be vertical. In the horizon tal position, the panels 27a mate to provide thermal shield ing for the head 15 .
