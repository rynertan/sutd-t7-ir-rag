# Improvements relating to optical pulse generating arrangements.

## Abstract
A differential delay optical coherent pulse generating arrangement, in which continuous wave light derived from a coherent light source is divided by beam splitting means into two optical paths, in which the light beam in one of the said paths is delayed relative to the light beam in the other of said paths by differential delay means prior to the sequential selection of the light from the respective paths by optical switching means to produce two coherent pulses in prede termined time displaced relationship and in which a frequen cy difference may, if required, be produced between the frequencies of the two coherent pulses.
