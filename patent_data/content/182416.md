# Cylindrical package.

## Abstract
Mainly cylindrical package having two closed head ends, one head end being provided with a stacking rim 11,17 , the inner dimensions of which are corresponding with the outer dimensions of the cylindrical part of the package, at least one closed weakening line 1,18 being provided near the head end having the stacking rim 11,17 . After breaking the weakening line 1,18 said head end with the stacking rim 11,17 may be turned over and used as a lid for reclosing the package.

## Claims
1. A mainly cylindrical package which is closed at both head ends by fixedly attached end walls, characterized in that one head end is provided with a stacking rim 11 or 17 , the inner dimensions of which are corresponding with the outer dimensions of the rest of the cylindrical part of the package and in that the cylindrical wall 7 or 14 , at least close to the head end having the stacking rim, is provided with a closed weakening line 1 or 18 which can be broken by tearing.

## Description
The invention relates to a mainly cylindrical package which is closed at both head ends by fixedly attached end walls. Such packages are generally known and mostly consist of a cylinder wall of cardboard or suchlike sheet material, at the head ends of which two circular end walls of suchlike sheet material, metal or plastics have been affixed. The expression fixedly attached means in this specification and claims that the end walls cannot be removed from the balance of the package without damaging it. Usually packages of this kind are opened by cutting through the cylinder wall or breaking it along one or more weakening lines, preventing a later re closure of the package. It is time that the use of a loose, reclosable lid greatly removes this disadvantage, but it additionally increases the price of the package while the risk of inadvertedly opening and pilfering. The invention envisages to provide a relatively inexpensive reclosable package devoid of the disadvantage as described herein above. The invention therefor provides a package as described hereinbefore, which is characterized in that one head end is provided with a stacking rim, the inner dimensions of which are corresponding with the outer dimensions of the cylindrical part of the package and in that the cylindrical wall, at least close to the head end having the stacking rim, is provided with a closed weakening line which can be broken by tearing. After opening of the package by breaking the weakening line, which is near the stacking rim, the required portion of its contents can be taken out and the package be closed again by turning the part with the stacking rim upside down and by placing it as lid on the remaining part of the package. Therefor it is preferred that the stacking rim is pinchingly fitting around the cylindrical part of the package. The cylindrical wall is preferably provided with a plurality of strips which are removable by tearing right around, so that the package can be reduced in size if required. For easy removal thereof, it is recommended that the removable strips each be provided with a pull tab which practically abuts the cylindrical wall. If it is desired that the package be as tight as possible, the tear strips are preferably defined by delamination lines, while perforation lines are preferred when as smooth a rim as possible is desired. To reduce the price, the package is preferably entirely made of cardboard. In connection with the durability of both the contents and the package, the cardboard is preferably provided with a moisture resistant coating which can be applied internally and or externally. The invention will be illustrated by means of the drawing in which some preferred embodiments of the invention are represented. The package according to the invention drawn in perspective in Fig. 1 3 can be adapted in size to the amount of contents still present therein by removal of strip shaped parts of the cylindrical wall. This package consists of a cylindrical wall 7 divided into strips 2 6 by parallel weakening lines 1. This cylindrical wall is sealed in a conventional manner by a top and bottom disc 8 and 9. In this case a stacking rim 11 having an inner diameter such that it corresponds with the outer diameter of the rest of the package is arranged around top disc 8. By pulling at tab 10 of strip 3 of the cylinder wall see Fig. 1 , this strip can be removed all around by tearing apart the adhesive joint 12 and simultaneously breaking the weakening lines 1 on both sides of it, so that the upper strip 2 with the top disc 8 attached to it can be removed see Fig. 2 and the contents 13 of the package, e.g. ice cream, are released. If it is desired to use a larger portion of the contents, the next strip 4 can also be torn off, as drawn in Fig. 2. After cutting off the contents protruding outside the remaining package, this remaining package can be sealed again by turning the upper strip 2 upside down with the top disc 8 and sliding the stacking rim 11, which is present thereon, over the upper rim of the remaining package, as shown in Fig. 3. It will be clear that by tearing off the next strips more of the contents 13 of the package becomes available. The alternative, very simple embodiment as shown in Fig. 4 also consists of a cylindrical wall 14 sealed at both head ends by a top and bottom disc 15 and 16. The stacking rim 17 above the top disc 15 is widened such that its inner diameter corresponds with the outer diameter of the rest of the package. Close to the stacking rim 17 the cylindrical wall is provided with a closed weakening line 18 which extends around the package and can e.g. be broken by means of a thread 19. The thread can be gripped at an end protruding outside the package near the longitudinal seam 20. This package as well as the embodiment described hereinbefore can, after it has been opened, be closed again by turning the torn off part upside down and sliding it with the stacking rim 17 over the upper rim of the remaining part of the package. Although packages are shown in the drawing in the form of a right circular cylinder, other cylinder shapes can also be used, e.g. with a square section having rounded corners.
