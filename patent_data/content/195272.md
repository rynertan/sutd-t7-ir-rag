# Voice mail system on audio tape.

## Abstract
The present invention is a magnetic tape based voice mail multi user message system. The invention uses a novel method of partitioning the tape and distributing a number of mailboxes on the tape in such a way as to minimize the average access time to individual mailboxes. This provides the advantages of a truly random access multi user disk based system at a small fraction of the cost. Incoming messages are recorded in random cells on a plurality of tracks on a tape. A memory stores the location of the nearest available cell to the next position of the play record head. When an incoming message is received, the system directs the play record head to the nearest cell in order to record a message. When a user calls in to leave a message, after accessing the system, he inputs a DTMF code indicating that he desires to leave a message, and another code indicating the mailbox address. After recording the message in the nearest cell, the system stores the location of the cell in the directory in association with the designated mailbox address.

## Description
VOICE MAIL SYSTEM ON AUDIO TAPE BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to voice mail systems for recording and playing back audio messages for use by a plurality of users. Substantially all presently known voice mail systems which can be used by more than a few users are disk based systems. A voice mail system is a record and playback system that stores messages intended for one of a plurality of users. All messages for a given user are stored in that user s mailbox. 1 while individual messages in a mailbox are logically related to a particular user, the messages are physically scattered throughout the disk. A directory stores the physical position of each cell containing a message for the same user, and associates those cells with a single mailbox. Such disk based systems are relatively complicated and expensive due to the use of disk storage and the requirement that voice messages be digitized to be stored on the computer disk. An example of such a system is shown in U.S. Patent No. 4,371,752 to ECS Telecommunications, Inc. now known as VMX . In the VMX system, a subscriber can access the voice mail system through a PBX private branch exchange to which the voice mail system is connected. The system, under the control of a computer processor, delivers prompting messages to a user and then responds to user commands.A user can record a message, review messages, or perform a number of other operations. Recorded messages are digitized and stored in a disk memory in association with a mailbox address. When the recorded message is to be replayed, the computer determines the location of messages in memory from the mailbox address indicated by the user. The computer then synthesizes the voice message from the digital representation stored in memory A user must enter a personal code in order to review his messages. This personal code entry prevents unauthorized access to the system. Voice mail systems have a number of advantages over the common answering machine For instance, a single message can be recorded once, but sent to a number of mailboxes on a distribution list. Messages can be tagged and organized according to specified parameters i.e., urgent, personal, etc. . A user accessing the system can then determine the number of messages and the type of tag without listening to all of the messages. The use of a cassette tape for a large voice mail system has been considered impractical because of the speed limitations in accessing portions of the tape.One approach is the use of a number of microcassettes on a carousel. Some cassette answering machines are somewhat similar in that they are able to provide personalized greetings for a few callers. U.S. Patent No.4,122,306 to Friedman, et al. shows a system which allows a caller to select a track on the tape having a specialized recorded message by the caller inputting a code number. U.S. Patent No. 4,194,089 to Hashimoto is another cassette system showing a method of providing a specific message for a specified calling party. One disadvantage of such systems is that they are slow because the tape must be moved until other messages are passed and an available portion for recording is reached. Another disadvantage is that the number of users is limited by the number of tracks on the tape. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is a magnetic tape based voice mail multi user message system. The invention uses a novel method of partitioning the tape and distributing a number of mailboxes on the tape in such a way as to minimize the average delay in accessing individual maLlboXeS. This provides the advantages of a truly random access multi user disk based system at a small fraction of the cost. Incoming messages are recorded in random cells on a plurality of tracks on a tape. A memory stores the location of the nearest available cell to the rest position of the play record head. When an incoming message is received, the system directs the play record head to the nearest cell in order to record a message. When a user calls in to leave a message, after accessing the system, he inputs a DTMF Dual Tone MultiFrequency code indicating that he desires to leave a message, and another code indicating the mailbox address.After recording the message in the nearest cell, the system stores the location of the cell in the directory in association with the designated mailbox address. When a system user desires to review all messages in his mailbox, he accesses the system and inputs a DTMF ID code and mailbox address. The play record head is directed to the track and cell location indicated in the directory for the mailbox address, and the message in the cell is played. The system then directs the play record head to other messages in the mailbox, as indicated by the directory in the order received, until all messages for the mailbox have been played.Such a recipient of the messages in a mailbox will be referred to as a boxholder herein. By using a magnetic tape rather than a disk to record messages, the system is more reliable and less expensive with the elimination of the disk and the digitizing circuitry. By using randomly accessed cells, rather than an entire single track, for each mailbox, the number of mailboxes is dramatically increased and the access speed is increased. The system is ideally suited for small or medium sized businesses. In between searches, the play record head is repositioned at the center of the tape, thereby increasing the access speed to any portion of the tape. The processor and memory keep track of the closest available cells to the center of the tape. Incoming messages are recorded in the closest available cell. If a cell has been deleted from memory for a mailbox after boxholder review, the cell is listed as available and the new message is recorded over the old message in the cell. Breaking a track of a tape into a number of cells creates difficulties in determining the beginning of a particular cell. Slippage and stretching of the tape and wear on the brakes causes inaccuracies in methods relying on elapsed time or reel revolutions. The detection of a marking signal on the tape is accurate, but requires the tape to be advanced at a slower speed.The preferred embodiment of the present invention combines both methods to obtain the advantages of each method while eliminating the disadvantages of each. In order to access a cell, the tape is first moved at high speed until the play record head is at a position close to, but prior to, the indicated location of a mark at the beginning of the cell The tape is then slowed and played until the mark is detected by a mark detector circuit. The system updates its notion of where it is on the tape to compensate for positioning error. The marking of the beginning of a cell with a mark tone may be done on the first recording of a message in such cell. This eliminates the need to format the tape before using it.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT Figure 1 shows a block diagram of the voice mail system of the present invention. Telephony circuit 10 interfaces with the telephone line to the central office 12. Telephony circuit 10 is also coupled via a line 14 to a central office simulator 16. Simulator 16 provides an interface for local access via a telephone 18, or any device that expects a two wire trunk line 20. A CPU central processing unit 22 is coupled to simulator 16 and telephony circuit 10. CPU 22 contains microprocessor 24 and RAM random access memory 26.Audio circuitry 28, coupled to CPU 22 and telephony circuit 10, controls the recording and playing on a cassette tape. Cassette motor and transport system 30 controls the movement of the tape. A voice synthesis circuit 32 provides the system prompting messages. Voice synthesis circuit 32 preferably contains digitized speech in a memory which is reconverted to analog signals. Alternately, a separate tape recorder could be used. The connection of telephony circuit 10 to CO simulator 16 and trunk line 20 is simply one method of providing access to the voice mail system. Alternately, for example, the voice mail system could be one extension of a PABX system. Figure 2 shows a schematic representation of a magnetic tape 34 used by the voice mail system. Four tracks, Tl T4, of tape 34 are shown. Lines 36 indicate the boundaries of the various cells. Line 38 indicates the center of tape 34. The addresses of certain cells are indicated by numbers C97 C104 at the top of the figure. Examples of the storage of messages for different mailboxes are shown by the indication of numbers representative of a mailbox in certain of the cells.For instance, cell C99 on track T1 is designated with mailbox Ml, as is cell C103 on track T2. Referring toTable 1 below, which shows the association of cell messages with mailboxes in the system memory, one can see the above two cells stored in conjunction with mailboxM1. TABLE 1 Mailbox Address Messages Track Cell M1 Ti, C99 T2, C103 M2 Ti, C102 M3 T2, C99 T3, C102 Cells C100 and C101 on track T1 contain a system greeting message and a system directory, respectively. Cells C100 and C101 on track T2 contain other system messages. In operation, to record a message, the voice mail system selects the closest available cell to center 38. After a boxholder reviews a message, he may indicate that the message should be deleted causing the reference to such cell under the mailbox in memory, as indicated in Table 1, to be deleted. Thus, that cell will be available for the recording of another message over the recorded message presently in the cell. The voice mail system can generate a system greeting, a system directory of mailbox numbers, individual mailbox greetings and prompting messages for users. The system greeting, system directory, and other messages are frequently played and are thus stored in the cells closest to center 38 of the tape 34. This storing location provides quick access to these messages. Prompting messages are separately generated by a voice synthesizer 32, rather than being stored on tape 34.Voice synthesizer 32 is used because these messages need to be played while the system is accessing a cell on tape 34, and thus cannot simultaneously play a message from the tape. The system is thus able to access a cell while the prompting message is being played, thereby improving the perceived system response time. The operation of the system of Figure 1 is. best understood by referring to the detail of audio circuitry 28 shown in Figure 3. Audio circuit 28 processes the voice input through a 2 to 4 wire converter 40. An input line 44 and an output line 46 are coupled to one side of 2 to 4 wire converter 40. A two wire telephone line input 42 is coupled to converter 40, which provides ingoing signals on input 44 to the remainder of audio circuit 28. An output line 46 of audio circuit 28, with outgoing signals, is coupled to telephone line 42 by converter 40. Output signals on line 46, which also appear on telephone line 42, are subtracted out from the signals on telephone line 42 so that input 44 has only remotely originating user input signals. This subtraction is illustrated graphically by isolating amplifier 48, which couples line 46 to line 42, and subtracting amplifier 50.Output line 46 is coupled to one input of amplifier 50 and is subtracted from the other input of line 42. Thus, the output signals from output line 46, which appear on telephone line 42, do not appear on input 44, thereby enabling a boxholder to input a control signal while a message is being played by the voice mail system. Input line 44 is coupled to a switch 52 which is connected to recording amp 54, which is coupled via a record line 56 to the play record head and control circuitry 58. Switch 52, which is controlled by microprocessor 24, determines whether the input signal is coupled to the play record head 58. Alternately, switch 52 will couple a marking oscillator 60 to play record head 58. Oscillator 60 produces a frequency tone mark indicating the beginning of a cell. A play output 62 of play record head 58 is coupled to a play amplifier 64. Play output 62 is also coupled to a mark detector 66 which detects the presence of a mark at the beginning of a cell. Play amplifier 64 is coupled to a switch 68, which is connected to output line 46 through a filter 69. Switch 68 is also coupled to a line 70 which is connected to voice synthesizer 32. Switch 68 is controlled by microprocessor 24 and couples line 46 to voice synthesizer 32 whenever a system message from the synthesizer is to be transmitted. Major features of the system may include the ability to leave messages, review messages, check message status, and add a personal greeting in addition to the system greeting for a particular boxholder s mailbox. while reviewing messages, a boxholder has the ability, among other features, to back up the tape, skip to the next message, delete a message, and restart the message. The boxholder indicates the action to be taken by inputting a DTMF signal to the system. The system is able to detect such an input code tone while it is playing a message, because the played message is subtracted from input 42 in 2 to 4 wire converter 40. Thus, although the telephone line 42 has the tone code plus the voice message being played, the subtraction of the output message signal in 2 to 4 wire converter 40 results in only the tone code being input to the voice mail system. Figure 4 shows a schematic representation of a counting mechanism in transport system 30 for determining the position of tape 34 relative to a play record head 72. A slotted ring is mounted on a reel axle 76.Slotted ring 74 has 18 slots in it. As reel axle 76 turns, an optical sensor 80 detects the passing slots.The output of optical sensor 80 is processed by circuitry 82 to produce a signal for the passing of a slot on the ring. Output 84 of circuit 82 is provided to microprocessor 24. Microprocessor 24 counts the signals which correspond to slots 78 passing transducer 80. Each count is referred to herein as a tick.The location of a cell on tape 34 is stored in memory 26 as a track number and a cell number. The beginning of a cell 36 is determined by the number of ticks from the center 38 of tape 34. The tick count will correspond to the position of play record head 72 over tape 34. However, because the diameter of a wrap of tape around reel 76 will vary, the number of ticks per inch of tape will vary. A conversion formula must be applied to the tick count in order to express the beginning of a cell 36 or the length of a cell in terms of ticks. The operation of the present invention is best understood by referring to the flow charts in Figures 5 and 6. The flow chart of Figure 5 shows the steps for recording a message on the voice mail system.A user can access the system through local access 18 or central office line 12, as shown in Figure 1. The sys tern greeting message of Fig. 2 is transmitted to the user. The system greeting is located on tape 34 and played in the same manner as other messages, as described below with reference to Figure 6. CPU 22 directs appropriate prompting messages to the user by directing switch 68 to connect to line 70, and voice synthesizer 32 to generate an appropriate prompting message. CPU 22 then responds to input signals from the user. The record sequence of Figure 5 commences when the user inputs a DTMF code indicating that he desires to leave a message. The user then inputs a DTMF code for the mailbox address to which the message is to be delivered in response to a prompting message. CPU 22 will decode the mailbox address Step A and will calculate the track and the number of ticks to the closest available cell Step B . CPU 22 will then instruct control circuitry 58 for play record head 72 to select the appropriate track Step C . The tape will then be moved at a high speed on fast forward or reverse to position the play record head 72 within approximately 2 seconds, at normal speed, of the available cell Step D . The position of record head 72 over tape 34 is deter mined by counting the number of ticks. CPU 22 will then determine whether a mark exists at the beginning of the cell Step E . If this is the first time that the subject cell has been accessed, no mark will exist. Record control 58 will then be put on mute and a quiet zone will be recorded up to the calculated position of the beginning of the cell Step E . Mark oscillator 60 will then be turned on for 250 milliseconds, being coupled to the play record control 58 by switch 52 on instructions from CPU 22 Step G . A single frequency, high amplitude 250 mS marking signal is thus recorded at the beginning of the cell. This method eliminates the need for the difficult formatting of tape 34 prior to operating the voice mail system and results in an automatically formatting system. If, in Step E, CPU 22 had determined that the mark already exists, transport 30 will pause for 100ms to allow play record head 72 to register against tape 34 Step H . Mark detector 66 will then be monitored by CPU 22 to determine whether there is an indication of a mark present for at least 50 milliseconds Step I . If no mark is detected after 8 inches of tape Step J , an error will be indicated and the routine will end Step K . When a mark is detected, an additional 200 milliseconds will be allowed to pass while motor 30 is running in order 1D enable the rest of the mark which should be 250 milliseconds long to pass play record d step L . The system s notion of its current position on the tape is then updated by changing the tick count to equal the tick count corresponding to the beginning of the cell in memory 26 Step M . The actua position on the tape may have varied from the desired position due to slippage or stretching of the tape, or other similar causes. In addition, an error in the tick count could result from dithering the loss of ticks starting and stopping transport 30 and different packing densities of tape 34 on counter reel 76. A onesecond quiet zone is then recorded after the mark StepN . Motor 30 is then slowed to 25 of its normal speed Step O .Control system 58 is then placed into a pause mode until any prompting messages currently being trans mitted by voice synthesizer 32 are completed Step P .In particular, it is anticipated that a prompting message, indicating to the user that he may now record his message, may still be running. The message from the user is then recorded Step Q . At the end of the message or the time allo cated to the cell, transport 30 is stopped Step R .Motor 30 is then put in an idle mode at normal speed Step S , and CPU 22 awaits further instructions. If the message is continuing as the end of the cell is reached, a prompting message will inquire whether the user desires to continue the message. Upon receipt of an appropriate user response by CPU 22, a standby prompting message will be transmitted to the user and CPU 22 will locate the closest available cell and repeat the recording procedure. The two cells will be linked together in memory 26. The speed with which motor 30 can arrive at the desired cell is improved because all recording is done at approximately 25 of the normal cassette record speed. This low speed requires a high frequency respònseclZ tape in order to result in an acceptable quality of the voice recording. Lower speeds are limited by the fre quenc y Jesponse characteristics of tape 34 and wow and flutter. The routine for playing a recorded message is shown by then flow chart of Figure 6. A boxholder may receive a message waiting signal from the voice mail system, or may call in to check for messages. A system greeting will be played and CPU 22 will direct appropriate prompting messages and respond to inputs from such boxholder. The boxholder will input a DTMF code indicating that he. desires to review his messages, and an additional DTMF .code which gives his personal mailboxI.D. number. This I.D. number prevents unauthorized access to the system. CPU 22 will determine whether any cells are listed under the input mailbox address.CPU 22, for each such cell, will determine the track and the number of ticks to the location of such cell Step AA . CPU 22 will then instruct control circuitry 58 for play record head 72 to select the appropriate track Step BB . Tape 34 will then be moved at high speed until play record head 72 is within approximately two seconds, at normal speed, of the mark step CC .Transport 30 will then pause for 100ms to allow play record head 72 to register against tape 34 before mark detector 66 is monitored Step DD . Mark detector 66 is then monitored to determine if a mark is indicated for a period of 50 milliseconds Step EE . If a mark is not indicated for 8 inches of tape Step FF , CPU 22 will indicate an error and end the routine Step GG . Upon a mark being detected, CPU 22 will update the tick count to correspond to the indicated location of the mark in memory 26 Step HH . Motor 30 will then continue for one second to allow sufficient delay in order to pass over the remainder of the mark and into the quiet zone on the other side of the mark Step II .Motor 30 will then be slowed to 25 of its normal speed Step JJ . CPU 22 will then cause motor 30 to pause until any prompting message from voice synthesizer 32 is cbmpleted Step KK . The message in the cell will then be played Step LL . At the end of the message, motor 30 will be put in idle at normal speed Step MM . If the message was long enough to span two cells, a pointer to another cell address would have been contained in memory 26 and CPU 22 would then cause the system to proceed to such cell address, and the above process would be repeated. During such movement, a message from voice synthesizer 32 would indicate that the message will continue momentarily. The voice mail system described above can have a number of features programmed into it. For instance, a personal code enables a boxholder to review messages in his mailbox. The system can include procedures for entering and changing such personal code.The system can also provide that a boxholder can record a personal mailbox greeting for any callers. Upon a user commanding the system to record a message into a boxholder s mailbox, the system would instruct cassette transport system 30 to go to a cell which will contain the recorded greeting and play the greeting before prompting the user to leave a message. The system could also be programmed to allow such a user to input a code during the playing of such message to skip the remainder of the message and proceed to recording the message.CPU 22 constantly monitors input 44 for such code commands while messages or prompting signals are being played. Distribution list messages could be sent by programming and updating distribution lists into the system and indicating the address of the distribution lists as the mailbox address. CPU 22 would then list all of the individual mailboxes on such distribution list as having received the applicable message. The present invention will allow any number of other features to be added, limited only by the imagination of the customer. The system of the present invention is thus adaptable to provide a large number of valuable services. As will be understood by those familiar with the art, the present invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit or essential characteristics thereof. Accordingly, the disclosure of the preferred embodiments of the invention is intended to be illustrative, but not limiting, of the scope of the invention, which is set forth in the following claims.
