# DISTRIBUTION FILTER NOZZLES AND FILTERS INCORPORATING SAME

## Abstract
A filter employing a discrete particle filter medium 11 , such as graded sand or the like, in which the outlet passage located at the bottom 8 of a bed of filter medium is provided in which air can be employed in the backwashing process to agitate the filter medium. The filter has shallow coarser layers 9, 10 of particulate material beneath the filter medium 11 itself and one set of outlet nozzles 14 having appropriately dimensional perforations positioned in the coarser or coarsest particle layer 9 . In addition further finer perforated surfaces 16 communicate with the bottom of the filter medium 11 itself and the arrangement is such that when air is introduced preparatory to, or during back washing the air emerges predominantly from the elevated finer perforated surfaces 16 .
