## Description
This invention relates to an acoustooptic modulation element for use in acoustooptically modulating each light beam by an acoustic wave and to an acoustooptic modulation system comprising such an acoustooptic modulation element. A conventional acoustooptic modulation element of the type described comprises an acoustooptic medium for acoustooptically modulating a single incident light beam by an acoustic wave. More particularly, the acoustooptic medium has a first surface for the incident light beam, a second surface parallel to the first surface, and a third surface between the first and the second surfaces. A transducer is attached to the third surface so as to transduce an electric signal into the acoustic wave. When the electric signal has a plurality of frequency components different from one another, the incident light beam which is given through the first surface is modulated into a plurality of output light beams by the acoustic wave resulting from the electric signal. The output light beams are emitted through the second surface in directions dependent on the frequency components of the electric signal, as well known in the art. Each of the output light beams is recorded or printed on a recording medium in a known manner. With the acoustooptic modulation element, the number of the output light beams is determined by the number of the frequency components. This means that each output light beam becomes weak in intensity with an increase of the frequency components. Accordingly, the intensity of each output light beam fluctuates with the number of the frequency components included in the electric signal. Such fluctuation of each output light beam brings about unevenness of printing and inevitably deteriorates a quality of printing. Another conventional acoustooptic modulation system comprises a beam splitter in combination with a plurality of acoustooptic modulation elements. With this system, the beam splitter splits the incident light beam into a plurality of split light beams so as to supply the acoustooptic modulation elements with the split light beams, respectively. Accordingly, each of the acoustooptic modulation elements individually modulates each split beam by an acoustic wave resulting from an electric signal. As a result, a single modulated light beam is emitted from each acoustic modulation element in a direction dependent on each electric signal. In order to produce a plurality of modulated light beams by the use of the above mentioned system, a plurality of acoutooptic modulation elements should be arranged in parallel. The system therefore becomes bulky in structure. In addition, the acoustooptic modulation elements should individually be adjusted to the respective split light beams emitted from the beam splitter. Such individual adjustment is very troublesome. It has been proposed in US A 4,124,281 to provide a single acoustooptic medium block having a first surface for a plurality of input light beams and a second surface, parallel to the first, for output light beams. A transducer is positioned on a third surface contiguous with the first and second surfaces and serves to transduce electrical signals into acoustic waves propagated parallel with the third surface. Signals are stored in the block in the form of index of refraction variation patterns. It is an object of this invention to provide an acoustooptic modulation element which is capable of modulating a plurality of input light beams without any fluctuation of intensities. It is another object of this invention to provide an acoustooptic modulation element of the type described, which is compact in structure. It is a further object of this invention to provide an acoustooptic modulation system which can readily be adjusted to each of split beams emitted from a beam splitter. An acoustooptic modulation element according to this invention is characterised in that the transducing means comprises a plurality of transducer units responsive to said electric signals and extended along said input light beams on said third surface substantially parallel to one another for individually propagating said acoustic waves into said block from said third surface towards said fourth surface. Referring to Fig. 1, an acoustooptic modulation element 20 according to a first embodiment of this invention is supplied with first through n th input light beams 21₁, 21₂, ..., 21 Each of the input light beams 21₁ to 21 A transducer member is attached to the third surface and is given first through n th electric signals which are in one to one correspondence to the input light beams 21₁ through 21 Referring to Fig. 2 together with Fig. 1, each of the first through the n th transducer units 23₁ to 23 Each of the input light beams 21 suffixes omitted is incident on the first surface at the Bragg angle in an incident position and is allow to pass through the block 22. As shown in Fig. 2, the incident position is present on a center line of the second electrode 28 and has a depth D from the third surface. The depth D is, for example, 1 mm. Let each of the input light beams have a spot size When no electric signal is supplied across the first and the second electrodes 26 and 28, each of the first through the n th input light beams 21₁ to 21 Each of the acostic wave or ultrasonic waves is propagated from each transducer unit 23 to the block 22 towards the fourth surface by supply of each of the electric signals which are previously subjected to amplitude modulation in a known manner. As a result, each input light beam 21 is subjected to modulation by each of the acoustic waves to produce first through n th output light beams. Each of the first through the n th output light beams includes a first order diffracted light beam shown by each solid line 31₁, 31₂, ..., 31 With this structure, the acoustic waves are internally reflected from the fourth surface. Such reflection adversely affects modulation of each input light beam. In order to avoid the reflection from the fourth surface, an acoustic absorber 33 is attached to the fourth surface. The absorber 33 may be of lead or the like. Thus, a plurality of parallel light beams substantially parallel to one another can be modulated by the use of a single acoustooptic modulation element. Further referring to Fig. 2, consideration is made about that directivity of each acoustic wave which is specified by velocity potential, as known in the art. It is generally pointed out that the velocity potential of the acoustic wave does not diverge within the acoustooptic medium block 22, as shown by broken lines 36 in Fig. 2, on condition that the block 22 and the transducer unit 23 are surrounded by a rigid body. According to the inventors experimental studies, it has however been found out the velocity potential of the acoustic wave practically objectionably diverges within the acoustooptic medium block 22, as shown by solid lines 37 in Fig. 2, if the above mentioned condition is not satisfied. It is assumed in the illustrated acoustooptic modulation element that the distance L is less than five times the width W of the second electrode 28 and that one of the two adjacent light beams is modulated by an acoustic wave with the other unmodulated by any acoustic wave. For brevity of description, a combination of the input and the output light beams may be simply called a light beam, as long as any confusion does not arise between them. Let the one and the other light beams be an m th and an m 1 th light beams included in the first through the n th light beams, respectively. Under the circumstances, it has been observed that the m 1 th light beam is accompanied by a spurious first order diffracted component resulting from modulation of the m th light beam and that an on off ratio, namely, an extinction ratio is reduced by the spurious first order diffracted component. Such a spurious component results from the divergence of the velocity potential of each acoustic wave. Therefore, the distance L must be longer than five times the width W of the second electrode 28 in order to completely suppress any adverse influence on the adjacent light beams. As a result, the illustrated element 20 inevitably becomes bulky in structure. Referring to Fig. 3, an acoustooptic modulation element 20 according to a second embodiment of this invention comprises similar parts designated by like reference numerals. Like in Fig. 1, an acoustooptic medium block 22 has a first or a front surface in front of this figure, a second or a back surface substantially parallel to the first surface and opposite to the first surface, and third and fourth surfaces directed upwards and downwards, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3, the block 22 has first through n th plateaus 41₁ to 41 The input light beams are incident on the first surface of the respective plateaus 41₁ to 41 The first through the n th transducer units 23₁ to 23 Further referring to Fig. 3, the block 22 has the fourth surface providing an arcuately recessed portion 45 recessed towards the third surface. The arcuately recessed portion 45 is extended between the first and the second surfaces. The arcuately recessed portion is nearest to the third surface in a center region of each of the first and the second surfaces and is gradually away from the third surface in both end regions laid on both sides of the center region, when each of the first and the second surfaces is divided between the third and the fourth surfaces in parallel, as shown by broken lines. Such an arcuately recessed portion serves to reflect each acoustic waves in various directions. Therefore, each acoustic wave is not substantially returned back to each of the transducer units. It is therefore possible to avoid interferences among the acoustic waves. An acoustic absorber as illustrated in Fig. 1 may be attached to the arcuately recessed portion 45 and may be laid on the internal side surfaces and the recessed surfaces. Referring to Fig. 4, the illustrated block 22 has a chevron shaped portion, namely, a triangularly recessed portion 46 on the fourth surface. The triangularly recessed portion 46 is recessed towards the third surface and is nearest to the third surface in the center region. It is possible with this structure to avoid interferences among the acoustic waves. Referring to Fig. 5, an acoustooptic modulation system according to a third embodiment of this invention comprises the acoustooptic modulation element 20 illustrated in Fig. 1. The system comprises a beam splitter 50 responsive to an incident light beam 51 for supplying the acoustooptic modulation element 20 with first through n th split beams as the input light beams 21₁, 21₂, ..., 21 Referring to Fig. 6 together with Fig. 5, the beam splitter 50 comprises a body 53 of quartz transparent to the incident light beam 51 and having a thickness T and front and back surfaces 54 and 55 substantially parallel to each other. The incident light beam 51 is incident on the front surface 54 at an incident portion. The front surface is coated with a reflection layer 56 except the incident portion. The incident portion is covered with an antireflection layer 57 with a part of the antireflection layer 57 superposed on the reflection layer 56. The back surface 55 is divided transversely of the incident light beam 51 into a plurality of areas which are equal in number to As shown in Fig. 6, the incident light beam 51 is given to the incident portion on the front surface at a predetermined incident angle ϑ ₀ and is transmitted towards the back surface. In this event, the incident light beam 51 is refracted at an angle ϑ ₁ of refraction. An internally incident light beam on the first layer 58₁ is partially transmitted through the first layer 58₁ and partially internally reflected towards the reflection layer 56. The reflection layer 56 internally reflects a light beam internally incident thereon towards the second layer 58₂. Similar operation is repeated between the second through the n 1 th layers 58₂ to 58 It should be recollected that the acoustooptic modulation element 20 illustrated in Fig. 1 is given the input light beams 21₁ to 21 Inasmuch as the distance L₁ between two adjacent ones of the split beams is calculated by Substitution of Equation 2 into Equation 1 gives Thus, the distance L₁ between two adjacent split beams can be determined by selecting the thickness T, the refractive index n₀, and the incident angle ϑ ₀. Taking the above into consideration, the reflection layer 56, the antireflection layer 57 and the first through the n th layers 58₁ to 58 Each of the reflection layer 56, the antireflection layer 57, and the first through the n th layers 58₁ to 58 As mentioned before, the reflectivities of the first through the n th layers 58₁ to 58 It is readily possible to form by the use of a known technique the first through the n th layers 58₁ to 58 Thus, the illustrated beam splitter can emit from the back surface the split beams substantially equal in intensities to one another. In addition, the split beams are substantially parallel to one another and sent from the beam splitter as the first through the n th input light beams 21₁ to 21 Referring back to Fig. 5, the acoustooptic modulation element 20 comprises the first through the n th transducer units 23₁ to 23 The electric circuit 60 comprises an oscillator 62 generating an oscillation signal of 80 MHz. The oscillation signal is delivered to first through n th modulators 64₁ to 64 The acoustooptic modulation element 20 individually modulates the first through the n th input light beams 21₁ to 21 The acoustooptic modulation element 20 illustrated in Fig. 3 may be substituted for the element 20 illustrated in Fig. 5. Referring to Fig. 7, the acoustooptic modulation element 20 is for use in combination with first and second optical systems 71 and 72 opposite to the first and the second surfaces of the element 20 with spacings left between the first optical system 71 and the first surface and between the second optical system 72 and the second surface, respectively. Each of the first and the second optical systems may be a cylindrical lens, an elliptic lens, or a spherical lens. The first through the n th split beams emitted from the beam splitter 50 are sharpened or reduced in spot sizes through the first optical system 71 to be given as the first through the n th input light beams 21₁ to 21 In general, an acoustooptic modulation element has a modulation bandwidth inversely proportional to spot sizes of each input light beam. Accordingly, the first and the second optical systems 71 and 72 serve to widen the modulation bandwidth of the acoustooptic modulation element 20 by reducing the spot sizes of the input light beams 21₁ to 21 Referring to Fig. 8, an acoustooptic modulation system according to a modification of this invention is similar to that illustrated in Fig. 5 except that a combination of a grating 75 and an elliptic lens 76 is substituted for the beam splitter 50 illustrated in Fig. 5. The grating 75 is made of optical glass and has slits of 12,000 inch and a lattice constant of 21,000 angstroms. As well known in the art, the incident light beam 51 is diffracted in directions determined by the grating 75. As a result, a plurality of diffracted light beams which are equal in number to A fiber grating may be substituted for the grating 75. Such a fiber grating is known in the art and comprises a plurality of optical fibers arranged in parallel with slits left between two adjacent ones of the optical fibers. While this invention has thus far been described in conjunction with a few embodiments thereof, it will readily be possible for those skilled in the art to put this invention into practice in various manners. For example, the first and the second optical systems 71 and 72 illustrated in Fig. 7 may be used in the system shown in Fig. 8.
