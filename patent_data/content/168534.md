# DIALKYLAROMATIC AND HYDROGENATED DIALKYLAROMATIC SYNTHETIC LUBRICATING AND SPECIALTY OILS

## Abstract
A synthetic dialkylaromatic hydrocarbon is described which is useful as synthetic specialty oil and lubricating oil base stock or base stock additive. The synthetic dialkyl aromatic hydrocarbon is characterized by possessing two pendant alkyl side chain groups of significantly different lengths, one short and preferably linear, on the order of 2 to 4 carbons, preferably 2 carbons, and the other long, on the order of 14 to 18 carbons, preferably 15 17, most prefer ably 15 16 carbons and mixtures thereof and linear, the aromatic group to which the two pendant alkylside chain groups are appended being a phenyl moiety. The synthetic dialkyl aromatics of the present invention which are useful as synthetic lubricant base stocks or base stock additives are characterized as possessing in total about 23 to 28 carbons preferably about 23 to 26 carbons most preferably 24 carbons and having kinematic viscosities at 100 C of approximately 2.2 to 3.7 cSt. These synthetic stocks also have high viscosity indices VI greater than about 95 and low pour points less than 40 C . The hydrogenated forms of the dialkylaromatic materials are also good synthetic specialty and lubricating oil base stocks and base stock additives.
