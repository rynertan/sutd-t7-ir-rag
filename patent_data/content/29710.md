# Toner concentration detecting apparatus.

## Abstract
A developing apparatus is provided in which the toner concentration of a developing agent 6 for electrostatic duplicator is detected with high precision by positively magnetizing the developing agent 6 present in the detec tion region in a toner concentration detecting container 8a . The developing agent within the detecting container is magnetized within a range of a magnetic flux density Hâ‚ƒ under which the permeability is not so changed with the change of magnetic field, even if a change of the magnetic flux of a magnetic roll or the like is produced.
