# Container closure assembly.

## Abstract
This disclosure relates to a closure assembly 24,62 for containers, particularly glassware containers, wherein the closures 26,68 may be readily removed even when the product is vacuum packed by the deformation of the cup shaped body 32 of the closure and the sealing ring 44 through the application of a diametrically opposite squeezing pressure. Normally the deformation of the closure body is prevented by a removable tamper indicating ring 28 which interlocks with the skirt 36 of the closure body and which must be ruptured to effect the removal thereof. The closure may assume various configurations depending upon whether the container is to be reclosed and whether there is an internal vacuum. The closure construction permits a modified sealing surface finish 66 on the glassware container.
