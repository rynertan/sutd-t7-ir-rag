## Description
This invention relates to the Semiconductor lasers are employed in home use optical data processing systems such as digital audio disks DAD and video disks VD . Semiconductor lasers enable the reduced size and cost and the marketability of these systems. However, the noise characteristics of semiconductor lasers has required improvement before they could be ideally utilized in these systems. Noise suppression is essential for the VD players, which read analog signals, while DAD players, which read digital signals, have higher noise allowances. Noise suppression, however, also becomes critical in DAD players as their sizes decrease. Relative intensity noise RIN levels of less than 5x10 ¹⁴ Hz ¹ and 1x10 ¹¹ Hz ¹ are required in analog and digital playback systems, respectively. RIN is defined as Single longitudinal mode index guided lasers suffer from mode hopping noise, which is caused by ambient temperature fluctuations, and optical feedback noise, which is induced by the light reflecting back to the emitting facet. Thus, RIN is so high 10 ¹¹ Hz ¹ around fo 200 KHz that single longitudinal mode lasers are generally not used even in digital playback systems. On the other hand, multi longitudinal mode gain guided lasers are less sensitive to the temperature fluctuations and the light feedback because not all the longitudinal modes but a few are sensitive at a same time. Therefore, gain guided lasers are preferably used in digital playback systems such as DAD players. However, competition among their longitudinal modes increases RIN as high as 1x10 ¹³ Hz. Therefore, gain guided lasers cannot be used for analog playback systems such as VD players. In Fig. 1, the oxide stripe laser is depicted as an example of gain guided laser. The oxide stripe laser comprises an n type GaAs substrate 2, an n type Aℓ Fig. 2 shows the channeled substrate planar CSP laser, which is disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication Kokoku No. 54 5273, as an example of index guided lasers.

YAMAMOTO et al. 680nm CW operation ... discloses a VSIS laser structure in which a V shaped groove is provided in a current block layer to reach the surface region of a substrate. It is an object of the present invention to provide a semiconductor laser which operates with a value of RIN low enough and with a astigmatic distance short enough to be utilized in analog playback systems such as VD players. To solve this object the present invention provides a semiconductor laser as stated in claim 1. The optical guiding channel has preferably a width of 3.8 to 4.2 µm and a depth of 0.3 to 0.8 µm. The current restricting channel has preferably width of 0.5 to 1.5 µm. In the semiconductor laser of this invention, deformation preventing layers can be inserted in the CBL so as to prevent the shoulders of the stepped channel from sagging during crystal growth. When the CBL is made of GaAs, the deformation preventing layers can be made of Al The deformation preventing layers should be formed such that they are exposed on side walls of the optical guiding channel and current restricting channel, preferably near the shoulders of them. In the semiconductor laser provided by this invention, the current injected into the active layer is reduced at the edges of the optical guiding channel adequately to make these active layer portions act as saturable absorbers. Thus, the saturable absorbers are self aligned on the optical guiding channel edges and cause the self pulse modulation of the laser oscillation. The self pulse modulation makes coherent length of the emitted light reduce markedly. Thus, is provided the This invention can be more fully understood from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which The operating mechanisms of a IS³ laser, which uses a stepped channeled substrate, will be explained below in comparison with that of a conventional VSIS laser, which uses a V channeled substrate. Figs. 4 and 5 show channel portions of the VSIS laser and the IS³ laser, respectively. In Figs. 4 and 5, reference numerals, 36, 38, 40, 42 and 44 show a semiconductor substrate, a current blocking layer CBL , a first cladding layer, an active layer, and a second cladding layer, respectively. The broken lines 46 in Figs. 4 and 5 show that the current, injected through the stripe window opened in the CBL 38, spreads as it flows towards the active layer 42. Using the stepped channel, the current width at its bottleneck and the optical guide width can be varied independently, while they cannot be, using the V channel. Moreover, using the stepped channel, the bottle neck of the current can be located much closer to the active layer 42, resulting in narrower current width in the active layer 42. Thus, the current injected into the active layer can be intentionally reduced at the edge regions denoted by II in Fig. 5 of the optical guide. In Figs. 4 and 5, gain distributions 48 and 52, respectively and optical density distributions 50 and 54, respectively are shown. By the way, it is well known that the active layer of a semiconductor laser acts as an saturable absorber when the injected current is reduced. Therefore, the saturable absorbers are self aligned at the edges of the wave guide when the stepped channel is used. It is also well known that self pulse modulation arises and makes the laser insensitive to the optical feedback when the capacity of the saturable absorbers is adequately adjusted. Therefore, the laser with such a low noise as to be used in VD players can be made more reproducibly using the stepped channel than using the V channel. An experimental result revealed that the broader becomes the region II, the higher becomes the maximum light power at which the self pulse modulation ceases. Hence, the current restricting channel 64 is preferred to be much narrower than the optical guiding channel 66, while the optical guiding channel 66 has to be narrower than the critical width for fundamental transverse mode operation. Consequently, accordingly to a main embodiment of the invention, the optical guiding channel 66 has a width of 3 to 5 µm and the current restricting channel 64 has a width of less than 2 µm. As to the depth of the optical guiding channel 66, it is 0.2 to 1.0 µm. If it is greater than 1.0 µm, the current spreads substantially in the active layer 42 and the region II vanishes effectively. On the other hand, if the depth of the optical guiding channel 66 is less than 0.2 µm, the channel cannot guide the optical field. Reactive ion etching RIE is capable of fine pattern delineation with vertical etched walls. Therefore, RIE is effective technique to groove the stepped channel of the present invention. The present invention will be explained below in connection with examples. The IS³ laser of the present invention was manufactured as shown in Figs. 6 to 10 1 As shown in Fig. 6, about 0.7 µm thick n type GaAs layer CBL 58 was grown on the p type GaAs substrate 56. Then, about 0.25 µm thick SiO₂ layer 60 was sputtered on the CBL 58. A photoresist layer 62 with a stripe window having a width u was made by photolithography 2 The SiO₂ layer 60 was selectively etched by buffered fluoric acid through the stripe window of the width u. The width w of the resultant stripe window opened in the SiO₂ layer 60 was controlled by the etching time. See Fig. 7 3 The CBL 58 was etched by RIE, as shown in Fig. 8, using the photoresist layer 62 as a mask and a channel 63 was formed. The channel width was equal to the stripe window width u, while the channel depth was controlled by the etching time 4 After removing the photoresist layer 62, the CBL 58 was etched again by RIE as shown in Fig. 9. This time, the SiO₂ layer 60 was used as a mask. Thus, a stepped channel composed of a current restricting channel 64 and a wave guiding channel 66 was formed to reach the substrate 56. The width of the wave guiding channel 66 was equal to the stripe window width w, while the depth of that was controlled by the etching time. On the other hand, the sizes of the current restricting channel 64 were same as those of the channel 63 5 After removing the SiO₂ layer 60, double hetero DH structure with n type GaAs ohmic layer 74 was grown by liquid phase epitaxy LPE on the channeled substrate as shown in Fig. 10. The DH structure was composed of a p type Aℓ As shown in Fig. 11, the fabrication procedure of the present example was same as that of the former example except that Aℓ Fig. 12 shows a typical current light characteristics of the IS³ laser of the present invention. As shown in Fig. 13, the IS³ laser of the present invention exhibits multi longitudinal mode operation. With the IS³ laser, each longitudinal mode spectrum is broad, and the whole spectrum seems to be composed of overlapping spectra having differing mode spacing. This unique spectrum and self pulse modulation observed in the IS³ laser suggests that repetitive Q switching is caused because of the self aligned saturable absorbers. Considering the well known phenomena that the band gap and refractive index vary when the carrier density in the active layer varies, the IS³ laser spectrum can be described as being derived from time domain variations in the carrier density during the repetitive Q switching. Relative intensity noise RIN of the IS³ laser was observed less than 1x10 ¹⁴ Hz ¹ across a 10 C to 60 C temperature range and with optical feedback of up to 1 . This low noise property is attributed to the short coherent length derived from the self pulse modulation and satisfies the noise specification for analog playback systems such as VD players. The IS³ laser was observed to operate in a fundamental transverse mode with an astigmatic distance of less than 15 µm at output power of up to 10 mW. Fig. 14 shows another example of the present invention. It is same as the Example 1 shown in Fig. 10 except that the active layer 106 is bent down towards the stepped channel. This structure was easily made by setting the crystal growth time of the p type cladding layer 104 shorter than that in the Example 1. In this structure, the current width in the active layer 106 is reduced because the active layer 106 is bent down so as to be located closer to the current restricting channel 114. Moreover, a bent active layer forms an optical guide by itself and, therefore, the optical guide width is also reduced less than the width of the optical guiding channel 116. Thus, with the bent active layer, the IS³ structure is fabricated reproducibly even if the stepped channel is deformed during the LPE. Although AℓGaAs and GaAs have been used as semiconductor materials in the examples, this invention is not restricted to those. Any semiconductor materials may be used so long as they can be used for a laser diode. As to the masking materials for RIE, not only the photoresist and SiO₂, which were used in the examples, but also other dielectric materials such as Aℓ₂O₃ and Si₃N₄ can be used. As described above in detail, the present invention provides the IS³
