# Gerotor type hydraulic machine.

## Abstract
A rotary valve 10, 12, 14, 16, 18 for changing the connections of the fluid inlet passages 54 and the fluid outlet passages 50 of a Gerotor type fluid rotary machine in which the fluid is contacted and expanded by a plurality of cavities defined by the teeth formed on a stator 24 and a rotor 56 in response to the orbital rotation of the rotor formed with one less external teeth than the number of the internal teeth on the stator. The rotary valve selectively communicates the fluid passages with the Gerotor cavities by means of its rotary commutator 10 which orbits with a phase difference of 90 with respect to the Gerotor rotor 56 , and the commutator 10 is rotatably accomodated in a spacer 14 disposed between an end cover 16 and a port member 12 having a plurality of fluid passages 44 . The clearance at each side of the commutator 10 is permanent ly determined by means of the width of the spacer 14 . The commutator 10 comprises spaced members 72, 74 that move in unison with a sealing ring 84 interposed between the two members 72, 74 .
