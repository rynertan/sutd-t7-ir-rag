# Etch bleaching liquid.

## Abstract
An aqueous acidic etch bleach solution comprising hydrogen peroxide, iron III ions and inorganic anions that form a silver salt having a solubility product not greater than 1 x 10 ⁸ determined in water at 20 C, characterized in that said solution contains in dissolved state as combination of H₂O₂ stabilizing agents citric acid and a polymer containing alkylene oxide units. Said combination provides a solution to the problem of producing ecologically acceptable and stable H₂O₂ solutions containing iron III ions. The etch bleach solution is useful for the production of coloured relief images and lithographic printing plates starting from silver images.
