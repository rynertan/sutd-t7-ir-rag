# Charge eliminating lamp device.

## Abstract
A charge eliminating lamp device, for use in an electro static copying apparatus, comprising a light shielding frame member 212 having a light transmission opening formed on that surface which faces the surface of an electrostatographic material 4 , a plurality of selectively energizable illuminating lamps 224 disposed within the light shielding frame member in spaced apart relationship in the width direction of the elec trostatographic material, and a plurality of inside edge restrict ing light shielding walls 226 disposed within the light shield ing frame member 212 and positioned adjacent to the insides of the illuminating lamps 224 respectively as viewed in said width direction. The charge eliminating lamp device includes selectively energizable auxiliary lamps 246 disposed among said illuminating lamps as viewed in said width direction. Alter natively, a partitioning light shielding wall is disposed within the frame member extending in said width direction for parti tioning the inside of the frame member into two sections in the moving direction of the electrostatographic material, and the il luminating lamps and the inside edge restricting light shielding walls are disposed alternatively in one and the other of the two sections. Alternatively, auxiliary light transmission openings are formed in at least one of the front and rear walls of the frame member located frontwardly and rearwardly as viewed in the moving direction of the electrostatographic material.
