EXAMPLE 16 Run 340 A mixture of 33.5 of molybdene naphthenate 6 wt. molybdenum content and 66.5 g. of Cold Lake crude oil 13.22 wt. Conradson carbon was charged to a 300 cc stirred autoclave. this mixture had a Conradson carbon to molybdenum atomic ratio of 35 to 1. The autoclave wasFlushed with hydrogen and pressured to 100 psia with H2S then to 2950 psia with H,. The autoclave as heated with stirring at 725 F. for 30 min. and 8400r. for 30 min. The average total pressure on reaction conditions was about 3000 psig. The reactor was coled, discharged and the contents filtered. The solid were washed with hot toluene followed by hexane to remove absorbed hydrocarbons, and then vacum oven dried. The recovered solids weighed 4.69 g.The solids had a surface area of 281 mê g, a carbon content of 21.51 wt. , a hydrogen content of 1.29 wt. and a molybdenum content of 42.9 wt. .EXAMPLE 17 In this example the precursor used to form the high surface area molybdenum catalyst was phosphomolybdic acid 20 MoO2 2H3PO4 48H2O, suplied by J. T. Baker ChemicalCompany . The preparation was carried out as follows. To a 30 ml stirred autoclave, there was charged 91.64 g. ofLight Arabian vacuu, gas oil 0.46 Conradson carbon and â solution comprised of 0.565 g. of phosphomolybdic acid in 1.695 g. of anhydrous isopropyl alcohol. The ratio of atoms of Conradson carbon to atoms of molybdenum in this mixture is 125 1. The autoclave was flushed with hydrogen and then pressured with 105 psia of H2S and 20C0 psia of hydrogen ac room temperature.The aucoclave was heated at 725 F. for 30 minutes followed by a 3G minute period at 840 F. Upon cooling to room temperature, the autoclave was depressured and the liquid concents were discharged and filitered to isolate the solid product. Adhering oil was removed from the solids by washing sequentially with toluene and hexane. The wasned solids were then dried aC 80 C. in an oil pump vacuum oven. There was recovered 0.49 g. of dry solids which had a surface area of 123 m2 g and contained 56 weight percent molybdenum.EXAMPLE 18 This example illustrates the use of a high surface area molybdenum catalyst and a cobalt irttpregnated high surface area molybdenum caralyst for the slurry thydrocracking of a Light Arabian vacuum gas oil. A Presaration of Molybdenum Catalyst The high surface area molybdenum cacalyst was prepared as follows. A mixture of 86.5 g of molybdenum naphthenate 6 molybdenum , 241.6 g. of Light Arabian vacuum gas oil 0.46 Conradson carbon content and 60.7 g. of ColdLake crude 12.8 Conradson carbon content was charged to a one liter stirred autoclave and pressured with 2000 psia hydrogen at room temperature, The autoclave gas heated over a perIod of 95 minutes to a run temperature of 8400F. and was held at this temperature for 28 minutes and then cooled rapidly to room temperature.The resultant solids, isolated by filtration, were washed with toluene and then with hexane prior to dying under vacuum. There was recovered 11.17 g.of molybdenum catalyst which exhibited a surface area of 244 mê g and contained 49 wt. molybdenum. This catalyst is designated hereinafter as Catalyst A. B Preparation of Cobalt Impregnated Molybdenum Catalyst Run 21 R 40 A sample of 0.41 g. of catalyst A, high surface area molybdenum catalyst powder, was mixed with 1.17 g. of cobalt naphthenate 6 cobalt in a 300 ml autoclave at room temperature. The reactor was flushed with hydrogen and then charged, at room temperature, with 200 psia hydrogen sulfide and 1300 psia hydrogen. Reactor temperature was raised to 662 F. over the course of 95 minutes and was held at 602 F. 678 F. for 30 minutes followed by rapid cooling to room temperature. The reactor was vented and flushed with nitrogen.Upon opening, it was observed that water and light hydro carbons, resulting from the decomposition or cobalt naphthenate, had condensed on the upper surfaces of the reactor.These deposits were removed. The cobalt impregnated molybdenum catalyst, which was observed as z black powder on the buttom of the reactor, was not removed, but left in the reactor or a vacuum gas o .1 hydrocracking test. The atomic ratio of cobalt to molybdenum in the finished catalyst was 0.57. This catalyst is designated hereinafter as catalyst B. C Vacuum Gas Oil Hydrocracking Runs For the hydrocracking runs a 300 ml stirred auto dave was charged w with catalyst and approximately 90 g. of a Light Arabian vacuum gas oil. See table for quantities charged. The autoclave was then flushed with hydrogen, charged with 2000 psia hydrogen at room temperature and heated over the course of 30 minutes to the run temperate, of 840 F. After a reaction time of 300 minutes at 840 F.the reactor was cooled rapidly to room temperature and the contents were analyzed. Hydrocracking results obtained with the high surface area catalysts are shown in Table VIII relative to the results obtained in a non catalytic thermal hydrocracking run. As is apparent from the data, thc high surface area catalysts gave hydrocracking results much superior to those obtained in the purely thermal conversion run. In particular, product desulfuriuzation was much higher, product unsaturation was much lower lower bromine numbers and the 655 F. conversion product distillate to naphtha ratios were, desIrably, higher.

The procedure used was similar to that of Example 2. The ratio of atoms ofConradson carbon to the sum of the atoms of molybdenum and cobalt in this preparation was 6.5 1. From a reactor charge consisting of 102.8 g. of Light Arabian vacuur gas oil, 8.22 g of Cold Lake crude, 6.92 g. of cobalt napthenate 6 cobalt by weight and 20.74 g of molybdenum naphthenate 6 Mo by weight there was recovered 3.11 g. of dry cobalt molybdenum catalyst which exhibited a surface area of 253 mê g. This catalyst is designated hereinafter as cstalyst C. The catalysts desulfurization activity was determined using the following procedure. To a 300 ml autoclave there was added the calcined presulfided catalyst powder, typically about 0,6g., and 92 g. of light Arabian vacuum gas oil which contained 2.42 wt. sulfur. The reactor was flushed with hydrogen and then charged at room tetrpera ure with 40 psia hydrogen sulfide and 2000 psia hydrogen.The reactor was heated as rapidly as possible 25 minutes to a temperature of 725 F, held there with stirring for 30 minutes and then the temperature was increased to 8000F for a final 25 minute contact prior to cooling to room temperature. Reactor products ere discharged and analyzed for sulfur content. As shown in Table IX the coprecipitated cobalt molydbdenum catalyst Run 60 R 15 had desulfurization activity superior to that of the non promoted molybdenum catalyst of this invention Run 21 R 57 .
