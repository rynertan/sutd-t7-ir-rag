## Description
Permanent waving is a process whereby a reducing agent is applied to the hair structure to open the disulfide linkages of the hair which are formed by the amino acid cystine. In the conventional two step process, hair is wound onto an appropriate mandrel, e.g., roller or rod etc., prior to and or following reduction with a suitable reducing agent. The protein chains flow under tension to assume the imparted shape. After rinsing, an oxidizing agent is then applied to re establish or close the disulfide linkages which, in effect, hardens the protein structure to lock it into the new position. Permanent waving may utilize a variety of reducing agents in a first step over a wide pH range. Depending upon pH, the waving process can be carried out over a wide temperature range. An essential element of a permanent waving composition is the reducing agent. Among the reducing agents are thioglycolic acid, salts, and esters thereof thiolactic acid and salts thereof alkali sulfides alkali bisulfites, cysteine, and the like. The bulk of the reducing compositions are based on thioglycolic acid, salts, or esters thereof. The hair may be waved with thioglycolates under acid conditions, where the pH will generally range from about 5.0 to about 6.9, preferably 6.5 to about 6.9. To this end, citric, lactic, phosphoric, and weak carboxylic acids are used as common acidifying agents. Acid waves based on thioglycolates utilize elevated temperatures up to about 60 C using heat caps, blow dryers and hair dryers. Alkali bisulfite and bisulfide waves may cover a wide pH range, from about 5.5 to 9.5, and are applied at room temperature. Alkaline or cold waves are generally used at a pH in the range of 7.5 to 10.0 with ammonia, alkali carbonates and bicarbonates, ethanolamines, and alkali phosphates used as common alkalizing agents. Alkaline waves are also applied at room temperature. The concentration of reducing agent, pH, and temperature are dictated by the hair condition, the time of processing desired, and the desired tightness of the curl. Contact with the reducing agent may range from 10 minutes or less to 30 minutes or more. After an appropriate contact time with the reducing agent, the reducing agent is rinsed from the hair, and an oxidizing agent is applied to close the disulfide bonds and set the hair. Excess oxidizing agent is then rinsed from the hair, and the hair dried. The most common oxidizing agents are hydrogen peroxide and bromate salts. Peroxides are applied over a pH range from 2.5 to about 4.0 and bromates from a pH of about 6.0 to about 8.0. Application is at ambient or elevated temperatures. Independent of the type of permanent wave applied, moisture is deleterious to the appearance of a permanent wave. A substantial increase in moisture content of the hair over that which existed at the time the wave was applied will tend to cause the curl to drop and become limp. By contrast, when hair of desired moisture content is exposed to low relative humidities, the hair tends to lose moisture and become frizzy. It has now been surprisingly found that pantethine and its reduced form, pantetheine, when combined with, or used in conjunction with, or incorporated as part of the reducing agent, composition or solution applied to hair, will impart unexpected and desirable qualities to the hair when processed through a permanent waving operation. Pantethine is the common name for the known compound, N,N dithiobis ethyleneiminocarbonylethylene bis 2,4 dihydroxy 3 3 dimethylbutyramide it is freely soluble in water it is synthesized by the formation of a peptide bond between panthenol and cysteine Pantetheine is the common name for the reduced form of pantethine, the chemical name for which is thiobis ethyleneiminocarboxylethylene bis 2,4 dihydroxy 3,3 dimethylbutyramide. Both are commercially available, for example, from Chugai International Corp., New York, N.Y. Although it is known from US A 3,285,818 that pantethine is cosmetically useful in hair tonics, surprisingly beneficial effects have now been found with its use in permanent waving operations. DE B 1 793 067 discloses disulfide compounds as oxidants in hair permanent waving compositions. However, no pantethine compounds are suggested. Pantethine, pantetheine or mixtures thereof, hereinafter sometimes referred to as the pantethine component, is herein used in perming operations, including the acid and alkaline types, to improve waving efficiency in one or more of the following parameters, as compared to conventional waving compositions. The preferred pantethine component is pantethine itself. A most significant effect is that pantethine and or pantetheine improves the curl efficacy of the permanent waving operation by decreasing the percent loss in curl retention, which is readily demonstrable at elevated humidities. It also enhances penetration of the perming composition into the permed hair and, in most instances, demonstrates increased swelling of the permed hair. It also demonstrates the significant effect of lessening the chemical damage done to hair by the permanent waving operation. The present invention is based on the use of pantethine and or pantetheine in permanent waving solutions to improve the efficacy of the waving operation without having an adverse effect on the permed hair. The present invention provides an improved permanent waving composition for hair which contains an effective perming amount of ammonium thioglycolate or glycerolmonothioglycolate as reducing agent for hair and wherein the improvement comprises having pantethine and or pantetheine in the permanent waving composition in an amount from 0.005 to 5.0 percent by weight. By the term an effective perming amount of ... as reducing agent for hair it is meant an amount of reducing agent which, when applied to the hair structure in a perming operation, is sufficient to open the disulfide linkages of the hair which are formed by the amino acid cystine. The compositions of this invention contain as mentioned from 0.005 to 5.0 percent by weight of pantethine and or pantetheine and, preferably, from 0.01 to 1.0 percent by weight. In alkaline perming operations, pantethine and or pantetheine is incorporated into the reducing solution prior to use. In acid perming operations, it is common practice to separate the acidic reducing solution from the balancing solution until the time of use. The pantethine and or pantetheine may be incorporated into either solution, preferably in the balancing solution. The reducing agent Glycerolmonothioglycolate is presently preferred for acid compositions and ammonium thioglycolate for alkaline compositions. The permanent hair waving process of the invention includes the steps of contacting mandrel shaped hair with a solution of the afore mentioned reducing agent for hair, which includes pantethine and or pantetheine, to open the disulfide linkages of the hair and the step of subsequently closing the disulfide linkages of the hair by application of an oxidizing agent to the hair to set the hair in conformity with the shape of the mandrel. In typical use, a reducing composition, containing an effective perming amount of the reducing agent for hair and the pantethine and or pantetheine, is combined with the balance of the constituents forming a net reducing composition for application to the surface of hair in a conventional manner. After the wave is curled and rinsed, the hair is oxidized using, for example, hydrogen peroxide or a bromate salt to set the curl. Rinsing is employed following oxidation and the hair dried. The amount of pantethine and or pantetheine is in the range from 0.005 to 5.0 percent by weight. With respect to acid reducing solutions, as indicated above, pantethine and or pantetheine may be combined with the reducing agent, which forms one component of a two component reducing system, the second component being termed the balancing composition. It is preferred that the balancer be an aqueous ammoniacal solution, preferably buffered. The pantethine and or pantetheine in combination with the reducing agent is added to the balancing solution prior to use to provide a net solution at a suitable pH for application to the hair. Alternatively, pantethine and or pantetheine may first be added to the balancing composition which then is admixed with the reducing agent prior to use. For acid waves, the pH may range from 5.0 to 6.9, preferably from 6.5 to 6.9. For alkaline waves, the pH may range from 7.5 to 10.0. In the latter instance, it is not necessary to employ a balancing solution and pantethine and or pantetheine may be combined with the reducing agent and a suitable alkalizing agent to be applied to the hair as a one component reducing system. As indicated, alkaline waves are applied at ambient temperatures, whereas ambient and elevated temperatures are used for acid waves with temperatures up to 60 C conventionally employed. The hair is wound on a mandrel, e.g. rod, roller, etc., in the conventional way, and the reducing composition of the invention is applied to the hair and allowed to soften the hair structure with attendant take up of pantethine and or pantetheine. After exposure, with heating, if required, generally for about 10 to 20 minutes, the excess reducing composition is rinsed from the hair, and a suitable oxidizer, for example, hydrogen peroxide or a bromate salt is applied to reset the cystine linkages. After thorough rinsing, the hair is dried to achieve a finished curl. As noted previously, marked beneficial results in permanent waving operations have been found upon incorporation of pantethine and or pantetheine into permanent waving solutions. A most advantageous effect is that pantethine and or pantetheine imparts a higher degree of waving efficiency than the same composition without the added pantethine and or pantetheine. This gives a tighter and more lasting curl, even upon exposure to relatively high humidity. With respect to rate of action, the use of pantethine and or pantetheine increases the rate of penetration of the reducing solution into the individual hair strands such that processing time can be reduced by up to 25 percent. Curls permed with compositions used in accordance with the invention are less susceptible to relaxation at high humidity than curls formed when prepared with identical compositions which do not contain pantethine and or pantetheine, despite the fact that more moisture is taken up by the hair. Because the hair curled with the compositions of this invention holds more moisture at reduced humidities, as compared to hair curled without the added pantethine and or pantetheine, the tendency of the curl to frizz at reduced humidities is minimized. In addition to providing higher waving efficiency, and hair which holds a higher degree of moisture over a broad humidity range without any substantial diminution of waving efficiency, pantethine and or pantetheine also imparts greater manageability, sheen and combability. Another important feature of the subject invention is the significant decrease in hair damage found in hair permed with waving compositions containing pantethine and or pantetheine as compared to this adverse effect observed in hair permed with the same waving composition without pantethine and or pantetheine. Moreover, the pantethine and or pantetheine has been found, for the lifetime of the prepared solutions, to be fully compatible with the reactive chemicals present in alkaline and acidic hair waving compositions. Thus, in a process for the permanent waving of hair which includes the steps of contacting mandrel shaped hair with a solution of reducing agent for hair to open the disulfide linkages of the hair and the step of closing the disulfide linkages of the mandrel shaped hair by application of an oxidizing agent to the hair to set the hair in conformity with the shape of the mandrel, the instant invention provides the improvement which comprises including in the solution of said reducing agent for hair of pantethine and or pantetheine in an amount from 0.005 to 5.0 percent by weight. An additional feature of this invention relates to the use of pantethine and or pantetheine in combination with urea. Such combined usage, when added to typical wave reducing compositions, even further increases waving efficiency than with pantethine and or pantetheine alone as indicated by increased curl retention, decreased processing time and or decreased hair damage. In general, from about 0.01 to about 5.0, and, preferably, from about 0.1 to about 1.0 percent by weight of urea is utilized in conjunction with pantethine and or pantetheine. While nowise limiting, the following examples illustrate the instant invention. In said examples, the symbol P signifies pantethine the symbol Pe signifies Pantetheine the symbol U signifies urea and the indicated amounts are in percent by weight. This example provides basic reducing formulations for both an alkaline waving operation and an acidic waving operation. These reducing formulations are used as controls in the subsequent examples. Also shown is a basic type of hydrogen peroxide oxidizing formulation used to neutralize hair permed with either the alkaline or acid reducing formulation. Virgin hair swatches, approximately 2 grams in weight are bound together at one end and trimmed to 17.8 cm 7 inches . After spraying with water to moisten, the hair swatch is wound tightly around a 12.7 mm 1 2 inch diameter perming rod. The moistened hair swatch is permed in the waving solution for 20 minutes, and then thoroughly rinsed with water. Then the switch is neutralized with the neutralizer of Example 1 for 5 minutes and rinsed again. The hair swatch is blown dry with low heat 40 50 C until thoroughly dry. After drying, the hair swatch is carefully unwound from the perming rod and hung vertically from the bound end. The initial length of the curl is measured before exposure in the humidity chamber and this measurement serves as the control basis against which the curl efficiency of the tested perm is determined. The hair swatches are then placed in a humidity chamber set at 90 relative humidity RH and 37 C. Relaxation of the swatches is measured after 60 minutes 60 in the humidity chamber. The swatches that undergo the least amount of relaxation at elevated humidity demonstrate the most effective perms. The percent loss in curl retention is determined by the formula Improved results in waving efficiency are also obtained upon addition of 0.01 and 1.0 percent by weight of pantetheine to the alkaline and acid waving solution controls of this Example 2. This example demonstrates the combined use of the pantethine component and urea to further improve waving efficiency. This example demonstrates the usefulness of the subject compositions in penetrating hair and in decreasing the amount of time required for perming operations under actual salon conditions. The penetration of active ingredients in perms is tested on consumers in the salon utilizing a half head method where the hair is shampooed, divided from the nape of the neck to the center of the forehead and wound on to the perming rods. A perm solution without the pantethine component is used to perm one side and a perm solution with the panthethine component is used to perm the other side. Each solution is applied to thoroughly wet hair. In evaluating acid waves, the procedure is modified by adding heat 40 50 C with a hair dryer. Both sides of the head are processed simultaneously generally about 5 15 minutes depending on hair type and porosity. Processing takes place until an S curl is observed or until the cosmetologist feels the perm his processed adequately. The time required for processing to be complete is recorded. Since penetration and processing time are dependent on each other, the side which is processed faster is also the side where the active ingredients penetrated faster. The hair is then rinsed for about 5 minutes using lukewarm water followed by neutralization with hydrogen peroxide solution for about 5 minutes. The hair is then rinsed again with lukewarm water. The rods are now removed and the hair appropriately styled. This example demonstrates the increased penetration of perm actives by the inclusion of the pantethine component according to the conventional iodine staining test for measuring percent penetration and percent swelling see, for example, Example 21 of U.S. Pat. No. 4,301,820 . Virgin blond hair swatches, approximately 2 grams in weight, are soaked in 0.1N Standarized Iodine Solution Anachemia Chemicals, Inc., Champlain, N.Y. for 24 hours. A single iodine stained hair strand is placed on a microscopic slide. Using 100X magnification, the initial fiber diameter D In addition, the percent swelling of the hair fiber which occurs with application of perm solution is evaluated. The total fiber diameter of the hair strand D This example demonstrates the enhancement in percent penetration and percent swelling resulting from the combined use of the pantethine component and urea in the subject compositions. Perming hair results in chemical damage of hair since disulfide bonds are broken by the reducing operation. The subsequent use of neutralizer does not reform all the broken bonds and, consequently, the hair to a certain extent remains damaged. Yield slope analysis illustrates the technique used to analyze hair strength which correlates with disulfide bond breakage. Thus, the less damaging the perm is, the less change in yield slope will be observed after perming. Virgin hair swatches, approximately 2 grams in weight and at least 25 cm long are bound together at one end. The swatches are then soaked in the appropriate perm solution for 20 minutes. After thorough rinsing with water to remove excess perm solution, the hair bundles are neutralized for 5 minutes and rinsed again. Swatches are air dried until thoroughly dry, generally for at least 12 hours, at ambient temperature. Utilizing a tensile strength tester Instron Model 1122, manufactured by the Instron Corp., Canton, MA , a single strand of hair is positioned between the two clamps of the tester at a standarized distance of 23 cm. With the instrument set at a crosshead speed of 100 mm minute and a chart speed of 200 mm minute, at least 20 single hair strands from each group are extended with a 20 g load setting. The slope of the yield region which correlates with covalent and disulfide bond breakage i.e. overall hair damage is measured for each hair. For each group of virgin hair, the mean yield slope for the 20 single hair strand measurements is calculated. The yield slope of unpermed virgin hair represents totally undamaged hair Control A . The mean yield slope of virgin hair permed with the reducing solution to be tested minus the pantethine component represents maximally damaged hair due to the perming operation Control B . The mean yield slope of virgin hair permed with the same reducing solution plus the pantethine component is then measured Perm C and the percent reduction in hair damage is determined according to the formula The following bisulfite waving formulation pH 7.0 is used as a Control in testing for waving efficiency.
