## Description
This invention relates to a heterogeneous vapor phase process for the catalytic hydrogenation of aldehyde s containing 1 to 8 carbon atoms to the corresponding alcohol s which process comprises contacting a vaporous stream of aldehyde s and a hydrogen containing gas with a solid catalyst comprising a reduced mixture of CuO andZnO at a temperature of between 1100 C and 1800C and a pressure of between 20 and 150 psig. It is well known to hydrogenate aldehyds to produce alcohols. The hydrogen adds onto the carbonyl group of the aldehyde to form the alcohol. The aldehyde so hydrogenated, may be a mixture of aldehydes formed by the oxo process, i.e., the reaction of olefins with carbon monoxide and hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst to add a carbonyl group at one of the carbon atoms of the olefinic group. The reaction of aldehyde and hydrogen is carried out in the presence of certain metal compounds which act as hydrogenation catalysts. The commonly used commercial hydrogenation catalysts include copper chromite cobalt compounds nickel nickel compounds which may contain small amounts of chromium or other promoters and mixtures of copper and nickel and or chromium. The nickel compoundsgenerally are deposited on support materials such as alumina and kieselguhr. Nickel catalysts are believed to be the most commonly used hydrogenation catalysts for converting aldehydes to alcohols, because of their apparent activity. There are one or more disadvantages in the use of these hydrogenation catalysts in a commercial operation catalytically hydrogenating aldehydes to alcohols. The use of copper chromite as an aldehyde hydrogenation catalyst requires that the hydrogenation process be carried out at higher temperatures and pressures.Also, since cooper catalysts are easily poisoned by sulfur compounds, costly and stringant controls of the process are required to remove and prevent these sulfur compounds from entering into the hydrogenation reactor4 Additionally, the use of copper chromite catalysts is environmentally hazardous and requires special and costly handling techniques because of the toxicity of the chromium. Lastly, the preparation of copper chromite is difficult and reproducibility in its manufacturing process is poor.However, copper chromite catalysts are still used as aldehyde hydrogenation catalysts because of their high selectivity. Cobalt compounds are active aldehyde hydrogenation catalysts but their use requires that the hydrogenation process be carried out at higher temperatures and pressures. Also, their activity is lower and they are more costly cobalt supply is becoming scarce at the present time than either nickel catalyst or copper chromite catalysts. Further, the selectivity of cobalt catalysts is not as high as that of copper chromite. Nickel catalysts are highly active aldehyde hydrogenation catalysts. An aldehyde hydrogenation process using nickel catalysts requires lower reaction temperatures and pressures than the use of either copper chromite or cobalt catalysts, a factor which makes then the most commonly used commercial hydrogenation catalysts.However, there are disadvantages in the use of these nickel catalysts in a commercial aldehyde hydrogenation process. A disadvantage of the nickel catalysts is that they are environmentally hazardous and require special and costly handling techniques because of their toxicity. A major and costly disadvantage in using nickel catalysts, as well as several of the other types of hydrogenation catalysts, is the high level of by products formed when hydrogenating aldehydes to alcohols. For most end use applications, the byproducts must be separated from the hydrogenation product. The principal by products are ethers and hydrocarbon gases. The amount of ethers formed may be anywhere from 0.5 to2.Oweight percent and higher, based on the reaction product. Since ethers form an azeotrope with the alcohol products formed in the aldehyde hydrogenation process and water, which is frequently present inthe product from the feed streams, a substantial amount of energy is required to separate the ether from the alcohol. For example, in the catalytic hydrogenation of butyraldehyde to butanol, butyl ether forms an azeotrope with the butanol product and water present therein. Butyl ether must be separated from the butanol, in order for butanol to pass purity specifications such as the specifications for use in making acrylates.This separation of butyl ether from butanol requires a series of costly distillation steps, and because of the butyl ether butanol azeotrope, four pounds of butÅa o is lost for every pound of butyl ether formed. The by product hydrocarbon gases are produced by the decomposition of aldehydes. For example, propionaldehyde is decomposed according to the following equation EMI4.1 This reaction results in aldehyde losses of anywhere from 1 to 5 percent, because of the reaction of aldehyde propionaldehyde and hydrogen to form the hydrocarbon gases methane and ethane .Also, this reaction causes losses in hydrogen efficiency of anywhere from 20 to 50 percent. Hydrogen efficiency the stoichiometric amount of hydrogen required in the reaction actual amount of hydrogen fed to the system .Loss in hydrogen efficiency is caused by the heavier hydrocarbon gases building up in the hydrogen recycle stream, which necessitates a need to increase the purge stream of the recycle line to avoid overloading the cycle compressor and to maintain hydrogen purity. Thus, the elimination of the formation of by product ethers and or hydrocarbon gases in a commercial aldehyde hydrogenation process is highly desirable, resulting in less energy consumption and a reduction in the investment in distillation equipment. Additionally, hydrogen and aldehyde efficiencies are increased by eliminating the formation of these by products. A reduced mixture of the oxides Of Cu and Zn has been used as a catalyst for reducing aldehydes to alcohols. U.S. Patent 2,549,416 describes a vapor phase process for hydrogenating aldehydes by passing them together with hydrogen over a catalyst comprising reduced copper plus zinc oxide. The process is carried out at temperatures of 100 to 300 C and pressure of at least one atmosphere. The preferred temperature range is 1500 to 250 C while pressures of 200 to 600 psig are preferred. U. S. Patent 4,052,467 describes a process for hydrogenating aldehydes to alcohols wherein the liquid feed contains at least 10 ppm and up to 1 weight percent of sulfur in the, form of ring type sulfur compounds. The liquid feed in admixture with hydrogen is contacted with a catalyst comprising a reduced mixture of oxides or hydroxides of Cu and Zn at a temperature of 4500 to 5500F 2320 to 2870C and pressure of 800 to 1200 psig. However, vhen the hydrogenation of aldehydes is carried out using a reduced mixture of CuO and ZnO as catalyst, temperature greater than 1800C and pressure greater than 150 psig, a considerable amount of 1heavies , such as esters are formed. For example, in the catalytic hydrogenation of propionaldehyde to propanol using said catalyst and reaction conditions, propyl propionate is formed. The propyl propionate must be separated from the propanol which requires a costly separation procedure. A process has now been found providing unobvious advantages over conventional hydrogenation processes. In accordance with the process of this invention aldehyde s containing I to 8 carbon atoms can be catalytically hydrogenated to alcohol s with negligible formation of by products such as ethers, and hydrocarbpn gases and also, with small amounts of heavies formation. The process involves contacting a vaporous stream of aldehyde s and hydrogen containing gas with a solid catalyst comprising a reduced mixture of CuO and ZnO at a temperature of between 110 and 1800C and a pressure of between 20 and 150 psig. With the use of a reduced mixture of CuO andZnO as the catalyst in a process for hydrogenating aldehyde s containing 1 to 8 carbon atoms to alcohol s and with the synergfstic combination of reaction temperatures of between 1100 and 1800C and pressures of between 20 and 150 psig, the formation of by product ether and hydrocarbon gases is negligible and the formation of heavies is low. This results in less energy consumption in the process since the refining system used to remove these by products and heavies from the alcohol product can be eliminated or greatly simplified.Moreover, hydrogen efficiency using the catalyst and reaction conditions of the present invention is increased to over 90 percent and aldehyde efficiencies are also high. Aldehyde efficiency actual amount of alcohol produced in the reaction the stoichiometric amount of alcohol that would be produced . Additionally, high aldehyde conversions as high as 99.997. conversions and high alcohol yields over 997o alcohol yield may be achieved by the use of the catalyst and reaction conditions of the present invention. Aldehyde conversiona amount of aldehyde converted total amount of aldehyde in the feed Alcohol yield amount of aldehyde converted to alcohol total amount of aldehyde in the feed . Moreover, the present catalyst has several advantages over copper chromite hydrogenation catalysts, such as their resistance to poisoning by sulfur compounds., their high reproducibility in manufacture, their lower manufacturing costs, their low environmental hazards and long life. Also, the activity of the present catalysts is generally about forty percent higher than the activity of copper chromite catalysts as determined on the basis of equal copper content. The process of the present invention is suitable for hydrogenating straight or branched aldehyde s containing 2 to 8 carbon atoms. These aldehydes include saturated aldehydes like acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde, isobutyraldehyde, n butyraldehyde, isopentyl aldehyde, n pentyl aldehyde, Z methyl pentyl aldehyde, crotonaldehyde, 2 ethyl hexaldehyde, methyl pentyl aldehyde, 2 ethyl butyraldehyfe, and unsaturated C,aLdehydes like acrolein, 2 ethylpropylacroleinEMI8.1 The aldehyde may be in a substantially pure state or admixed with a component s other than an aldehyde. Further, a mixture of aldehydes may be employed. The aldehyde or mixture of. aldehydes employed herein may be obtained by an oxo process. A portion of the totality of the product mixture of an oxo process may be employed. Thus, the aldehyde s products or a portion of them may be separated from the product stream of an oxo process for hydrogenation by the process of this invention. For the purpose of providing an aldehyde feed, a conventional oxo product stream may be employed. The aldehyde or mixture of aldehydes employed herein may also be obtained by processes other than the oxo process, such as by oxidation of olefins or saturated hydrocarbons or by an aldol condensation. The process of the present invention comprises contacting a vaporous stream of aldehyde s conaining 1 to 8 carbon atoms and hydrogen alone or in admixture with other gases desirably gases inert to the aldehyde and the catalyst , with a solid catalyst comprising a reduced mixture of CuO and ZnO.The gaseous mixtures containing hydrogen include inert gases such as nitrogen, or carbon dioxide. The term hydrogen containing gas as used herein includes both substantially pure hydrogen gas as well as gaseous mixtures containing hydrogen .. The mole ratio of contained hydrogen gas to aldehyde s may be generally from 15 to 40 and preferably, from 20 to 30. The hydrogenation process of the present invention is conducted at a temperature of between 110 and 1800C preferably between 1300 and 1700C and at a pressure of between 20 and 150 psig, preferably between 50 and 100 psig. The mixture of CuO and ZnO, before reduction, contains from 10 to 70 percent by weight CuO and from 90 to 30 percent by weight of ZnO. The preferred amount of CuO in the mixture is from 20 to 40 percent by weight, while the preferred amount of ZnO in the mixture is from 60 to 80 percent by weight, The most preferred amount of CuO in the mixture is from 30 to 36 percent by weight while the most preferred amount of ZnO in the mixture is from 62 to 68 percent by weight. The catalyst may contain minor amounts of other materials such as chloride, sodium, sulfur and aluminum oxide. The catalyst may be prepared by any of the methods known in the art of forming a composite of copper oxide and zinc oxide. The catalyst may be prepared by fixing the separate oxides, by coprecipitation of the oxylates, carbonates, or acetates, followed by calcination.The coprecipitation method is preferred. Generally, the mixture of CuO and ZnO is reduced by hydrogen or carbon monoxide at a temperature in the range of between 160 and 250 C for several hours, preferabty for 8 to 24 hours. The mixture of CuO and ZnO is reduced prior to its use as catalyst in the aldehyde hydrogenation process.Hydrogen or CO, or mixtures thereof, are used as the reducing agent. The hydrogen, CO, or mixtures thereof, are generally mixed with an inert gas such as steam, nitrogen, or combustion gas, to maintain the catalyst bed temperature and to carry away the heat of reduction. Reduction of the mixture of CuO and ZnO is complete when no more hydrogen is being reacted as shown by analysis of the inlet and outlet hydrogen. Complete reduction of the mixture occurs when the total amount of water produced in the reduction is equal to the stoichiometric value of water which should be produced when a given amount of copper oxide is reduced to copper.This value is about 0.079 pounds of water per pound of catalyst for a mixture containing 35 weight percent ofCuO. An inert carrier material may be included in the catalyst composition. The catalyst is generally formed into pellets, tablets, or any other suitable shape prior to use, by conventional techniques. It is advantageous that the mixture of CuO andZnO have an internal surface area of 25 to 40 sq.. m per gram. The internal surface area is determined by the well known BET method. The process of the present invention is most conveniently carried out in a continuous manner, although semi continuous or batch operations may also be employed.In the preferred method of continuous operation, an aldehyde, mixture of aldehydes, or oxo reaction products, a hydrogen containing gas, and optionally, a carrier gas such as nitrogen, may bebroughttogether and, under the desired pressure contacted in the vaporous state with the catalyst. The reaction zone advantageously is an elongated tubular reactor wherein the catalyst is positioned. The vapors are contacted with the catalyst. The present process is carried out at a space velocity of between 500 and 4000 hr 1, preferably between 1000 and 4000 hr l space velocity is total volume of aldehyde and hydrogen at standard conditions of temperature and pressure per volume of the catalyst per hour . The alcohol product from the hydrogenation reaction is separated from the hydrogen by condensation and the excess hydrogen is compressed and recycled to the reaction zone. The crude alcohol product may be used in this form or it can be further purified in a conventional manner such as, by fractional distillation.If desired, any unconverted portion of the aldehyde or aldehyde mixture may be separated from the reaction product and recycled to the reaction zone and preferably, admixed with fresh feed gases prior to entering the reaction zone.
