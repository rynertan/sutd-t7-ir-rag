## Description
The present invention relates to a fuel feed device, particularly for diesel engines, with fuel filtering, heating and emulsifying members. In internal combustion diesel engines, the presence of impurities and water in the fuel can seriously compromise the proper operation and life of the constituent members of the fuel injection equipment. A further drawback, in the case of low ambient temperature, is that the paraffinic components contained in the diesel oil separate with subsequent formation of paraffin crystals able to clog the fuel circuit ducts. The solid impurities present in the diesel oil are currently filtered by disposing several filters along the fuel feed pipe, but these filters are unable to prevent the formation of paraffin crystals or to remove the water from the diesel oil. This water can be either already present in the diesel oil when it is supplied or can collect subsequently following condensation of the moisture in the air contained in the tank. The presence of large water droplets in the fuel feed circuit leads to several difficulties, such as low efficiency, starting difficulties and surface oxidation. In addition, this water tends to accumulate in the said filters, making it necessary to periodically bleed them. The problem therefore arises of providing a fuel feed device which allows fuel filtering and heating while preventing water accumulation by dispersing it together with the fuel, so as not to reduce the engine efficiency, but instead to utilise the positive contribution made by the water if emulsified in fine dispersion within the fuel. EP A 0 015 193 discloses a fuel feed device for diesel engines, comprising an intake filter with a filter element, disposed in the fuel tank at the mouth of the intake pipe. EP A 0 045 707 relates to a filter with a heating device. US A 4 273 078 describes a fuel supply system with a device for emulsifying water which accumulates in the fuel tank. The present invention provides a fuel feed device, particularly for diesel engines, comprising an intake filter disposed in the fuel tank at the mouth of the intake pipe thereof and filtering, heating and emulsifying means disposed downstream of the fuel feed pump before the injection pumping unit, wherein the filtering, heating and emulsifying means comprise a surface heat exchange member traversed by a heating fluid in the form of the engine cooling liquid, a filtering element, and an emulsifying member, means being provided for controlling the temperature to which the fuel is heated, characterised in that the filtering, heating and emulsifying means are arranged as a selfcontained unit and comprise a closed casing to which a fuel inlet pipe and a fuel outlet pipe are connected and which is subdivided by a filtering element into two separate chambers, in communication with the fuel inlet pipe and fuel outlet pipe respectively, in the closed casing the surface heat exchange member comprising a coil connected to the engine cooling liquid circuit and run by the cooling liquid, the fuel outlet pipe from the casing being provided with a dip tube extending to the bottom of said casing and fitted at its lower end with an emulsifying member in the form of a self supporting, rigid, porous element able to finely disintegrate the liquid which passes through it, the means for controlling the temperature comprising a temperature sensor located in the casing and drive flow control means for the liquid traversing the coil. The filtering element consists of a paper filter cartridge which can be replaced when clogged. The closed casing of the filtering, heating and emulsifying unit comprises in its lower part, within the chamber communicating with the fuel outlet pipe, a recess forming a collection sump into which there opens the lower end of the dip tube provided with the emulsifying member, which is conveniently in the form of a sintered bronze capsule of predetermined particle size and porosity. The filtering, heating and emulsifying unit is provided with means for sensing the pressure drop of the traversing fuel and arranged to provide a signal if a predetermined pressure drop between, the unit inlet and outlet is exceeded. The temperature sensor is disposed in the vicinity of the fuel outlet pipe and measures the temperature of the outlet fuel. A pipe which connects the coil to the engine cooling liquid circuit is also provided with an automatic flow regulator valve controlled by the temperature sensor and arranged to maintain the temperature of the fuel leaving the unit constant. Conveniently, the temperature sensor is disposed in a recess communicating with the fuel outlet pipe from the filtering, heating and emulsifying unit, in a position spaced apart from the outlet flow such as to ensure a delay in the response of the sensor to changes in the outlet fuel temperature. The intake filter at the inlet mouth of the fuel intake pipe consists of a lowerly open casing into which the pipe which recycles excess fuel to the tank opens and from which the fuel intake pipe draws by way of a filtering element, heat transfer being attained within said casing by direct mixing between the heated recycled fuel and the intake fuel. Conveniently, particularly if of considerable length such as to cause high heat loss, the fuel intake pipe from the tank and the excess fuel recycle pipe to the tank are disposed side by side and provided with common insulation at least over a part of their path from the tank to the engine. Further details will be apparent from the description of one embodiment of the invention given hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which As shown in Figure 1, fuel is fed to the internal combustion engine 1 from the tank 2 by means of a feed pump 3. The engine 1 is provided with a pumping unit 4 connected to the injectors 5 and possesses a cooling circuit comprising a circulation pump 6, a radiator 7 and a thermostatic valve 8. Along the fuel feed pipe from the tank 2 to the engine 1 there is disposed an intake filter 9 and a filtering, heating and emulsifying unit 10. The outward and return pipes feeding the fuel to and from the engine are conveniently provided with common insulation 11. The filtering, heating and emulsifying unit 10, disposed conveniently downstream of the feed pump 3, is shown in section in Figure 2 and consists of a casing 12 with a closure cover 13 provided with threaded connectors 14, 15, for connecting respectively the inlet and outlet pipes for the fuel fed by the pump 3. The cover 13 is also provided with inlet and outlet connectors 16 and 17 for the engine cooling water which circulates through the coil 18. A filter cartridge 21 enclosed between elastic gaskets 22 and supported by the grid 23 divides the interior of the filtering, heating and emulsifying unit 10 into two coaxial chambers 19, 20 communicating respectively with the connector 14 of the inlet pipe and the connector 15 of the outlet pipe. The outlet pipe connector 15 is connected to a dip tube 24 extending as far as the lower zone of the casing 12, which comprises a recess forming the collection sump 25. At the lower end of the pipe 24 there is an emulsifier 26 formed from a sintered bronze capsule having a particle size and porosity such as to emulsify the water contained in the diesel oil by minute subdivision of the flow. A pressure difference sensor 27 communicates with the inlet chamber 19 and the outlet pipe connector 15 or chamber 20 by way of respective ducts 28, 29, and enables an indication to be provided, for example on the vehicle dashboard, when the filter cartridge 21 is clogged to an extent requiring its replacement. The outlet pipe connector 15 is also provided with a recess 30 in which a temperature sensor 31 is disposed in a position distant from the outlet fuel flow so as to ensure a delayed response, and is arranged to operate a valve 32 disposed in the pipe feeding the engine cooling liquid to the coil 18, so as to keep the temperature of the outlet fuel from the unit 10 constant. The tank 2 houses the intake filter 9, shown in greater detail in Figure 3. It consists of a filter mesh 33 disposed around the intake pipe 34 and enclosed by a lowerly open casing 35 into which the fuel return pipe 36 opens, and which forms a vessel 37 surrounded by the tank 2. A vent 38 allows any gas formed in the feed circuit to be released. In this manner, because of the small volumes concerned, the vessel 37 provides effective heat transfer between the hot fuel recycled to the tank and the engine feed fuel, which thus undergoes an initial heating. Heat transfer between the recycled fuel and the engine feed fuel is further facilitated by the side by side arrangement of the respective pipes provided with common insulation 11, particularly if said pipes are of considerable length. The purpose of the filtering, heating and emulsifying unit 10 is to heat the fuel, using for this purpose the engine cooling liquid circulating at high temperature and feeding it to the coil 18 to raise the temperature of the fuel to a predetermined value controlled by the temperature sensor 31 and valve 32 at about 40 50 C at which there is no paraffin separation or paraffin crystal formation in the diesel oil. The position of the sensor 31, which provides a delayed response depending on the distance of the sensor from the main flow zone, allows the higher temperature of the cooling liquid on engine start up, caused by the temporary exclusion of the radiator 7 from the circuit by means of the thermostatic valve 8, to be utilised to transfer a greater quantity of heat to the fuel and dissolve any solid paraffin formations. The filter cartridge 21, conveniently of paper, is of known type and can be replaced when its degree of clogging exceeds a predetermined value indicated by the sensor 27. Particularly during rest periods, the water contained in the fuel within the casing 12 tends to decant, and this water collects in the collection sump 25. The dip tube 24 enables it both to be directly withdrawn so preventing its accumulation and the need to bleed it off, and to be dispersed with the fuel fed to the engine. The water present is thus emulsified by the emulsifier 26, to obtain a fine dispersion of the secondary liquid, namely the water, in the main liquid, namely the diesel oil. The water, disintegrated by the emulsifier 26 into droplets having a diameter of a few microns and enclosed within the diesel oil droplets, does not come into contact with the walls of the pipes through which the fuel passes, thus preventing the formation of the oxides which normally form when the water comes into contact with the metal surfaces. Furthermore, the small quantity of water uniformly distributed and atomised within the diesel oil, and the fine atomisation of the diesel oil itself by the action of the emulsifier, contribute to improved combustion and greater efficiency.
