# Process for preparing aromatic polycarbonates of improved melt processability.

## Abstract
The intrinsic viscosity of a high molecular weight aromatic polycarbonate resin is reduced and the melt processability is concomitantly enhanced by the inclusion of a small amount of a fatty acid or acids. The mixture of polymer and acid is more readily extrudable, without detriment to other desirable physical and chemical prop erties.

## Description
PROCESS FOR PREPARING AROMATIC POLY CARBONATES OF IMPROVED MELT PROCESSABILITY BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Aromatic polycarbonate resins are known engineering thermoplastics which can be molded into clear transparent articles that are suitable for various commercial purposes. The aromatic polycarbonates can be prepared by known processes, such as those described in the patent literature, for example, U.S. Patents 3,153,008 4,018,750 4,123,436 and 4,469,861. Many present commercial applications make desirable the good thermal and physical properties that are characteristic of aromatic polycarbonates. However, because of the size and complexity of the molds that are required in at least some of the cases, it would be advantageous to improve the melt processability of the polymer to achieve greater ease of flow through the extruder and into the mold. One way to achieve this is to use a polymer of lower molecular weight and, correspondingly, lower intrinsic viscosity. Typically, however, there are manufacturing problems associated with the preparation and isolation of commercial scale quantities of lower molecular weight aromatic polycarbonates, for instance, poly bisphenol A carbonates having an intrinsic viscosity I.V. of less than 0.45 as measured in solution in chloroform CHC1 at 250C. 3 Thus, it has heretofore often been necessary to add agents which function to enhance the melt flow properties of the polymer. For instance, British Patent 1,544,788 discloses high molecular weight aromatic polycarbonate resins prepared with chain stoppers comprised of a C to C 6 carboxylic acid and a diphenol in combina 9 26 tion. The polymer is described as having good mold release and mechanical properties. To improve the flow properties, they recommend the use of small amounts of a compound containing three or more functional groups, such as hydroxy groups page 2, second column, lines 80 110 of the British patent . SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The discovery has now been made that the intrinsic viscosity of a preformed aromatic polycarbonate resin can be reduced and the melt flow properties correspondingly enhanced by the inclusion of a small, effective amount of a fatty acid or acids. Typically, the additives are C to C carboxylic acids, for 9 26 example, capric acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, ceratic acid, mixtures of any of the foregoing, and so forth. Only small. amounts of the fatty acid need be employed. For instance, when a poly bisphenol A carbonate resin is melt extruded with 0.58 by weight of stearic acid at 3200C., the intrinsic viscosity of the polymer is found to be reduced from 0.48 to 0.39 deciliters per gram dl g. in methylene chloride at 250C., relative to the untreated polymer. Moreover, this is accomplished without detriment to other desirable properties. Without intending to be bound by any theory of the invention, it is postulated that the fatty acid acts as a polymer chain cleaving agent which breaks the polymer chains during high temperature processing, for instance, at those temperatures encountered in an extruder, thereby permitting better flow. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In the preferred embodiments employed for the practice of this invention, the aforementioned fatty acids, which may be used individually or in mixtures of two or more, will be of the general formulaEMI3.1 12345 in which R 1 R2 R , R and R are the same or different and are hydrogen or halogen, and r is an integer from 7 to 24. Preferred embodiments will contain from about 0.2 to about 2.0 wt. of the fatty acid or acids, based on the weight of the polycarbonate resin. The aromatic polycarbonates for which this invention is useful are high molecular weight, thermoplastic homopolymers or copolymers, and preferably those comprised of units of the formulaEMI3.2 in which A is a divalent radical of a dihydric phenol. Especially preferred are aromatic polycarbonates having units of the formulaEMI3.3 6 7 in which R and R are hydrogen, lower alkyl, or and X2 phenyl X and X are lower alkyl or lower alkenyl m and n are zero or independently integers from 1 to the maximum number of replaceable hydrogen atoms and the average number of repeating units is at least 30, and usually from about 40 to about 300. The terms lower alkylW and lower alkenyl refer to alkyl and alkenyl groups having from 1 to about 10 carbon atoms. The preferred polycarbonates are typically characterized by a number average molecular weight from about 8,000 to about 100,000 or greater, and an intrinsic viscosity from about 0.43 to about 1.0 deciliters per gram as measured in solution in chloroform at 250 C. Typical of the dihydric phenols useful as starting materials in the formation of the above polycarbonates are 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propane bisphenol A hydroquinone resorcinol 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl pentane 2,4 dihydroxydiphenol methane bis 2hydroxyphenyl methane bis 4 hydroxy 5 nitrophenyl methane l,l bis 4 hydroxyphenyl ethane 3,3 bis 4hydroxyphenyl pentane 2,2 dihydroxydiphenyl 2,6 dihydroxy naphthalene bis 4 hydroxyphenyl sulfone 2,2 dihydroxydiphenyl sulfone 4,4 dihydroxydiphenyl ether and 4,4 dihydroxy 2,5 diethoxydiphenyl ether.Especially preferred is bisphenol A. In the preparation of the carbonate polymers used in the instant invention only one dihydric phenol may be used. Alternately, a mixture of two or more different dihydric phenols may be employed. The carbonate precursor which is employed can be a carbonyl halide, a diaryl carbonate, or a haloformate. The carbonyl halides can be carbonyl chloride, carbonyl bromide, and mixtures thereof. The haloformates suitable for use include mono or bihaloformates of dihydric phenols bischloroformates of hydroquinone, monochloroformate of bisphenol A, etc. or bishaloformates of glycols bishaloformate of ethylene glycol, neopentyl glycol, polyethylene glycol, etc. When using bishaloformates, equimolar amounts of free dihydric phenols are required to effect polymerization. When polymerizing monohaloformates of diphenols no free diphenol is required.The diaryl carbonates include diphenyl carbonate, di halophenyl carbonates such as di chlorophenyl carbonate, di bromophenyl carbonate, di trichlorophenyl carbonate, etc., di alkylphenyl carbonates such as di tolyl carbonate, etc., di naphthyl carbonate, di chloronaphthl carbonate, and the like.The preferred carbonate precursor is carbonyl chloride, also known as phosgene. One method of preparing the aromatic carbonate polymers involves the heterogenous interfacial polymerization technique utilizing an aqueous caustic solution, an organic water immiscible solvent such as methylene chloride, at least one dihydric phenol, a carbonate precursor such as phosgene, a catalyst, and a molecular weight regulator, and water. Another useful method for preparing the carbonate polymers involves the use of an organic solvent system that also functions as an acid acceptor, at least one dihydric phenol, a molecular weight regulator, water, and a carbonate precursor such as phosgene. The catalysts which may be employed are any of the suitable catalysts that aid the polymerization reaction of the dihydric phenol with the carbonate precursor to produce the polycarbonates. Suitable polymerization catalysts include, but are not limited to, tertiary amines such as triethylamine, quaternary ammonium compounds, and quaternary phosphonium compounds. The molecular weight regulators employed may be any of the well known compounds that regulate the molecular weight by a chain terminating mechanism.These compounds include, but are not limited to, phenol, tertiary butyl phenol, Chroman I, para cumylphenol, and the like. The temperature at which the phosgenation reaction proceeds may vary from below OOC. to above 1000C. The reaction proceeds satisfactorily at temperatures from room temperature 250C. to about 500C. Since the reaction is exothermic, the rate of phosgene addition may be used to control the reaction temperature. Addition of the melt flow enhancer, the compound of formula I above, may be accomplished in any convenient manner. For instance, the compound, or mixture of compounds is desired, may be dry blended with the polymer resin powder, as on a mechanical mixer. The compound or compounds may be dissolved in a mutual solvent with the polymer and coprecipitated. As another alternative, the compound may be introduced into a melt of the polymer through a porthole in an extruder. Use of the compound in the prescribed amounts will normally result in a reduction in the intrinsic viscosity of the polycarbonate of at least 0.02 deciliters per gram dl g. , as measured in a solution of the polymer in chloroform at 250 C. The treated polymer is also useful in combination with other polymers and or additives conventionally employed with thermoplastic polymers, for example, antioxidants, stabilizers, colorants, mold release agents, flame retardants, mineral fillers e.g., clay , reinforcing fillers e.g., glass fibers , impact modifiers, and so forth. Any of these supplementary ingredients may be employed in the standard or usual amounts in the present compositions. The treated polycarbonate and blends thereof are utilizable in processes for the production of shaped molded articles. Illustratively, in one procedure a mixture of the polycarbonate and compound, alone or in combination with additional ingredients, is passed through an extruder at a temperature above the glass transition temperature of the polymer the temperature at which the polymer begins to soften , for example, from about 250 to about 3200C., then injection molded, for example, at a temperature from about 250 to about 3200C. 40 to 1000C. mold temperature .
