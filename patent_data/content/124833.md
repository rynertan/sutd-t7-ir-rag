## Description
Heat Stabilizers for Halogenated Resins Background of the Invention This invention relates to stabilizer compositions containing an aliphatic mercaptan and at least one sulfurcontaining organotin compound. More particulary, this invention relates to stabilizer compositions which are halogen free and which contain an aliphatic mercaptan and at least one sulfur containing organotin compound wherein up to 80 by weight of the mercaptan can be replaced by an alkali or alkaline earth metal salt of a mercaptan or mercapto acid. It is well known in the art that various halogen containing resins, particularly vinyl halide polymers which include homopolymers and copolymers of vinyl chloride undergo deterioration of physical properties and color changes upon their exposure to heat during processing, particularly the processing into formed articles of commerce.Color changes which are undesirable occur during the early stages e.g. within the first 5 to 20 minutes of the elevated temperature processing that the polymer encounters in extruders, injection molding and blow molding machines, etc. This color change is often manifested in various degrees of yellowing of the polymer although other hues have also been observed. This development of color during the early stages of processing has received increasing attention in recent years and has become a significant consideration in the stabilization of halogen containing polymers. However, there still remains considerable need for improvement of the early color inhibition performance of stabilizers for halogen containing polymers. U.S. Patent No. 4,360,619 discloses stablizer compositions containing at least 1 mercaptan containing organic compound and at least 1 organotin compound, wherein the stabilizer compositions must contain 0.16 to about 10 by weight of a halogen based on the total weight of the stabilizer composition. These stabilizer compounds are used to stabilize halogen containing polymers. In the examples, infra, it has been shown that these halogen containing stabilizers do not perform as well as the halogen free stabilizers of the instant invention. Statement of the Invention The present invention is directed to a composition for stabilizing halogen containing resins consisting essentially of a mixture of i an aliphatic mercaptan and ii at least one sulfur containing organotin compound having a C Sn S group therein, with the proviso that up to 80 by weight of i can be replaced by an alkali or alkaline earth metal salt of a mercaptan or mercapto acid, wherein said composition has a weight ratio of i to ii ranging between 25 1 and about 1 20. Detailed Description of the Invention The stabilizer composition which is halogen free of the present invention has been found to stabilize halogen containing polymers against heat degradation. The mercaptans which are operable in this invention have the formula RSH I where R is a hydrocarbon radical e.g. alkyl or cycloalkyl of 1 22 carbon atoms optionally substituted by XH,EMI3.1 where R1 is an alkyl of 1 20 carbons, alkenyl of 2 to 20 carbons, cycloalkyl of 3 to 20 carbons, aryl of 6 to 20 carbons or mixed alkyl aryl group of 7 20 carbons and both X and Y are independently selected from oxygen 0 and sulfur S . The R group of formula I may be derived from a mercaptan, or a mercapto alcohol, or an ester of a mercapto alcohol or a mercaptoacid. Examples of suitable aliphatic mercaptans are those in which the R group is methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, amyl, hexyl, octyl, lauryl, hexadecyl, octadecyl, allyl, methallyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, or a substituted hydrocarbon radical such as 2 carbomethoxyethyl, cyanoethyl of the type described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,471,538 and the like. Those aliphatic mercaptans having 8 to 18 carbons, e.g. decyl or dodecyl mercaptan, are usually preferred because the lower mercaptans are unsuitable for use on account of their offensive smell. Mercapto alcohols, 2 meccaptoethanol, 2 mercaptopropanol, 3 mercaptopropanol, thioglycerol, thiodiethylene glycol, and others may be mentioned.Particularly suitable are esters of mercapto alcohols in which the hydroxy groups are esterfied by an aliphatic, aromatic, or alicyclic saturated or unsaturated monocarboxylic acid. Readily available mercaptoacid esters are those of thioglycolic acid, such as ethyl thioglycolate, isooctyl thioglycolate, tridecyl thioglycolate and generally the esters of mono and dibasic aliphatic and aromatic mercaptoÅacids, such as esters of betathiopropionic acid, thiolactic acid, thiobutyric acid, mercaptolauric acid and mercaptosuccinic acid. The sulfur containing and organot in compounds of this composition have the following formula EMI5.1 wherein a is 1 or 2 R2 is a hydrocarbon radical selected from the group consisting of alkyl 1 8 carbons, cycloalkyl of 3 8 carbons, aryl of 6 8 carbons, and alkyl aryl of 7 8 carbons wherein said hydrocarbon radicals may have a substituent selected from the group consisting of CN,EMI5.2 or CO2R where R is an alkyl of 1 20 carbons, alkenyl of 2 20 carbons, or alkyl aryl of 7 20 carbons R is as previously defined Z is O, S, R2, SR, or S b Sn R2 c SR 3 c where b is 1, 2, or 3 and c is 1 or 2. Other organotin sulfur containing compounds which are within the scope of this invention have the following formulasEMI5.3 wherein R2 is as previously defined. d is 1 or 2, with the proviso that when d is 2, the organotin sulfides exist principally as cyclic trimers IV , and n is 2 to about 1000. All of the organotin sulfur containing compounds of the present invention and methods of preparing them are known in the prior art. The alkali or alkaline earth metal salts of mercaptans, which are used in this invention, are described in U.S.Patent 4,115,352, and have the following formulas EMI6.1 wherein M is a group IA metal an alkali metal in which case p l or a group IIA metal an alkaline earth metal in which case p 2 K is a group IIA metal R is as previously defined X and Y are. independently selected from 0 and S, andR4 is an alkylene linking group of 1 5 carbons which may be part of a cyclic structure and which may optionally be substituted with halogen, XH, XRl, EMI7.1 where R1 is as previously defined. The stabilizer composition of the present invention is useful as a component of a halogentated resin to provide stability against deterioration of the resin by heat the stabilizer component can be used over a range of about 0.05 to about 10 phr that is, parts by weight per 100 parts of halogenated resin . The preferred range is about 0.25 to about 5.0 phr. The chemical nature of the halogenated resin is not critical and typical suitable embodiments are disclosed in U.S. patent 4,115,352. Preferably the resin is a vinyl halide resin, specifically, a vinyl chloride resin.
