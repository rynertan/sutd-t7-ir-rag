# Apparatus for cutting grass.

## Abstract
An apparatus for cutting grass having a rotatable head 7,8 and cords 13 extending from the rotatable head the head accommodating a reel 9 within a chamber defined by the head, the cords being payed out through outlets 7b formed in the head only when the head rotation is stopped and the head is simply bumped against the ground. The bottom of the head is formed with an opening 8b through which a downwardly biased depressing member 10 projects from inside the head, being connected to the reel, and between the ceiling 7 of the head and any one of depressing member 10 and the reel 9 is provided a pair of ratchet teeth mechanisms 15, 16 which allow the rearward rotation of the reel when the reel and the depressing member normally biased downwardly is depressed against the ground, the above ratchet mechanisms performing the reverse rotation of the reel through their guiding structure.
