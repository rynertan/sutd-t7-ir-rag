# Method for manufacturing acrylate plates.

## Abstract
After a polymerised acrylate plate 5 is removed from the moulding chamber 2, 3 it comprises around its circumference a cord 1 . When such a plate is sawn to pieces one is confronted with the problem that a considerable part of the waste strips comprises a piece of said cord and this cord could have a very negative influence on the depolymer isation process of the waste strips. To solve this problem the flexible cord consists of a depolymerisable plastic to which a plasticizer and if necessary materials improving the extrudability have been added. Said plasticizer and said materials are stable under depolymerisation conditions, or at least will not decompose into harmful components.

## Claims

## Description
Method for manufacturing acrylate plates. The invention relates to a method for manufacturing acrylate plates comprising disposing a flexible cord at some distance from the circumference of a first moulding plate, lying a second moulding plate on said cord, pouring a liquid acrylate into the moulding chamber confined by said moulding plates and said cord, bringing the assembly of moulding plates, cord and acrylate in a device in which polymerisation of the acrylate at increased temperature takes place, and removing the moulding plates. Such a method belongs to the prior art. The manufactured plates are sawn into pieces of the desired dimensions and waste strips are sold. To one or more edges of an important part of these waste strips a piece of said cord is adhered said cord consisting of the usual polyvinyl chloride. To employ the waste material economically it has to be depolymerised. If this depolymerisation process of the waste strips would take place together with the adhered PVC cord, the PVC would burn by which hydrochloric acid would be set free which has a very disadvantageous influence on the retort, while further the combustion residues of the PVC have a contaminating effect on the depolymerised product and by inhaling would be injurious to health. The buyer of the waste strips has the choose either to throw the strips with cord away or to saw the cord from the strips. Both possibilities are rather expensive.The waste material without PVC cord is worth approximately four times as much as the waste material without PVC cord. In an old process a rubber cord was used around which cellophane was wound to may remove the cord from the polymerized plates easily. This process costs a lot of labour, however a more important disadvantage is that the edges of the acrylate plate after having removed the rubber cord, are so sharp that they could cause injuries. The invention is based on the idea that a considerable saving can be achieved in applying the process as indicated in the preamble, if the waste material obtained after sawing the moulded acrylate plates into pieces of certain dimensions could be depolymerised without removing the cord and without the above mentioned disadvantages. Therefore according to the invention the method indicated in the preamble is characterized in that the flexible cord consists of a depolymerisable plastic to which a plasticizer and if necessary materials improving the extrudability have been added, said plasticizer and materials being stable under depolymerisation conditions, anyway do not decompose into harmful components. By the application of the invention the waste strips can be treated in a depolymerisation retort without being confronted with the above mentioned disadvantages.Also no trouble with sharp edges is experienced. It has appeared that the rather simple measure according to the invention may lead to considerable economical results. As a rule commercially available plastic cords are not depolymerisable the idea that depolymerisable cords may be manufactured indeed and may be used in moulded acrylate plates, is at the root of the idea of the present invention. It is important that during the depolymerisation process the quality of the regenerated monomer is not reduced. Although polystyrene as a base material for a cord is not excluded, it is preferred that the cord consists of 40 to 60 parts of grains or dust of polymethyl metacrylate or polyacrylate and 60 40 parts of a plasticizer. To increase the extrudability a lubricant may be added to the cord material, while it often will be preferred that the cord material will comprise an antioxydant. It is important that the cord adheres well to the edge of the moulded plate of polymerized acrylate, as the loosening of the cord could lead to problems such as very sharp edges of the plate, rim or shrink feet, leakage of the mould. A cord of the above composition meets all the conditions. Obviously the cord may be hollow. The method according to the invention will now be eludicated with the aid of the figures. Figure 1 shows a cross section of a device used for manufacturing acrylate plate. Figure 2 shows a view of the device according to figure 1. Figure 3 shows an example of the pattern according to the which the plate is sawn into pieces. Figures 1 and 2 show two mould plates 2, 3 of glass which are spaced by means of a cord 1 and which are maintained in this position by clamping members 4. A liquid acrylate is poured into the space confined by the two moulding plates and the cord. The assembly is brought for some time in a polymerisation device to polymerise the material to form a plate 5. After cooling and removing of the clamping members one obtains a cord surrounded acrylate plate from which in accordance with the pattern shown in figure 3, pieces of previously determined dimensions are sawn. These pieces may be subjected to a depolymerisation process without any disadvantage, as the cord 1 according to the invention consists of a depolymerisable plastic to which a plasticizer and, if necessary, materials improving the extrudability have been added. All the substances of which the cord is composed are stable under depolymerisation conditions, anyway do not decompose into harmful components. As a consequence of the application of the invention from the pieces remaining after sawing the plate, no cord containing edge have to be sawn off before these pieces are supplied into the depolymerisation device. The savings obtained thereby are considerable. Good results are obtained with a cord consisting of 50 parts of grains or dust of methylmetacrylate and 50 parts of a plasticizer. It is not excluded that small amounts of lubricant an or an anti oxydant are added to this material. The possibility of applying the dust set free during the sawing of the acrylate, provides additional benefit. The cord can be hollow. Several modifications are possible within the scope of the claims. In certain cases polystyrene could be used as a base material for the cord. However, polymethyl metacrylate and or polyacrylate are preferred.
