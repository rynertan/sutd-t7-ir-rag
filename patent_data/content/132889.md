# Nickel boride polymer in oil catalyst.

## Abstract
A finely divided nickel boride hydrogenation catalyst which is stabilised with an organic linear polymer dispersed in a fatty substance like a triglyceride oil or a fatty amide is provided. The catalyst is stable upon storage and has a good selectivity. This catalyst yields excellent results in hydrogena tion processes.
