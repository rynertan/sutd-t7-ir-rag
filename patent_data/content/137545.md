## Description
General Electric Company, Schenectady, New York, U.S.A.Applicant mentions as inventor Roelof van der Meer.Article manufactured wholly or partly from a polymer mixture and comprising a lacquer layer or an adhesive layer. The invention relates to an article from a polymer mixture which comprises a polyphenylene ether, optionally a polystyrene or a rubber modified polystyrene, and is provided with a lacquer layer or an adhesive layer. Articles manufactured from a polyphenylene ether and having a polyurethane lacquer layer are known from French Patent Application 2,293,892. The known articles are manufactured from a polyphenylene ether without any further additions. In such articles a good adhesion between the polyurethane lacquer or adhesive layer is of importance. The invention provides articles having a good adhesion between the lacquer layer or adhesive layer and the actual article. In particular, the invention provides articles having a lacquer layer on the bais of a polyurethane or an alkyd melamine or having a polyurethane or epoxy adhesive layer. The article according to the invention is characterized in that it is manufactured from a polymer mixture comprising a polyphenylene ether and a epoxy compound. Polymer mixtures comprising a polyphenylene ether, optionally a polystyrene or a rubber modified polystyrene and an epoxy compound, are known per se from Japanese Patent Application 45 120514 laid open to public inspection under No. 48 39017. Chemical Abstract, Vol. 81, no. 20, November 1974, number 122,066 u describes an adhesive composition containing poly phenylene oxide and an epoxy resin having good adhesion to copper foils. The composition is adhered to the copper foil at elevated temperature 300 C and pressure 50 100 kg cm3 . It is furthermore known from German PatentApplication 30.39201 that the adhesion of polyurethane foam to articles formed from a polyphenylene etherpolystyrene mixture can be improved by the addition of a special impact proof modified polystyrene as described in German Patent Application 25 25 019. A good adhesion with lacquers and adhesives can be obtained when the article is manufactured from a polymer mixture which in addition comprises a block copolymer having blocks derived from a conjugated diene and from a vinyl aromatic compound. This applies in particular to the adhesion with lacquers, for example, polyurethane lacquers and alkyd melamine lacquers. The articles according to the invention are manufactured from a polymer mixture comprising the following constituents A. a polyphenylene ether B. an epoxy compound.This polymer mixture may furthermore comprise C. a saturated or unsaturated block copolymer D. a polystyrene or a rubber modified polystyrene E. usual additives for polymer mixtures comprising a polyphenylene ether.A.Polyphenylene ether. Polyphenylene ethers and their preparation are described in numerous patent publications, for example, in United States Patents 3,306,874 3,306,875 3,257,357 and 3,257,358. The polymer mixture according to the invention may comprise one or more of all the known polyphenylene ethers, notable also homopolymers, copolymers and graft copolymers. The polyphenylene ether in the polymer mixtures according to the invention preferably comprises units derived from 2,6 dimethylphenol.B. Epoxy compound. The following compounds may be used as an epoxy compound 1 Epoxide resins which are prepared by condensing phenols having two or more OH groups with epichloro hydrin in various ratios. 2 Epoxide resins which are prepared by condensing alcohols having two or more OH groups poly alco hols with epichlorohydrin. 3 Glycidyl ethers derived from phenols or alcohols having one OH group. 4 Glycidyl ethers derived from amine compounds. 5 Epoxidized higher olefins or cycloalkanes. Typical examples of epoxide resins mentionedB 1 are the condensation products of bisphenol A or bisphenol F with epichlorohydrin for example, Araldit GT 7071, Araldit GY 266 and Araldit GT 6099 of CibaGeigy , condensation products of resorcinol and epichlorohydrin, condensates of tetrabromobisphenol A and epichlorohydrin and the glycidyl ether products of phenol Novolak or kresol Novolak, for example Ciba EPN 138 of Ciba Geigy. Condensates of phenols having two OHgroups and epichlorohydrin having a reasonably high molecular weight, for example the phenoxy resins produced by Union Carbide Corp., may also be used. As examples of the epoxide resins mentionedB 2 may be stated the condensates of ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, butylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, glycerin, trimethylol ethane, trimethylol propane, or pentaerythritol with epichlorohydrin. As examples of the glycidyl ether products B 3 may be mentioned phenyl glycidyl ether, n butyl glycidyl ether, cresyl glycidyl ether, and 2 ethylhexyl glycidyl ether. As an example for B 4 is mentioned a diglycidyl ether derived from aniline. As an example of the compounds mentioned B 5 may be stated epoxidized unsaturated oils, for example, soya bean oil and linseed oil Edenol D 81 and Edenol B 316, respectively, of Henkel . Due to the small plasticizing effect in polymer mixtures comprising a polyphenylene ether, epoxy resins having a molecular weight or more than 1,000 are preferably used. C. Saturated or unsaturated block copolymer. Block copolymers which may be used in the polymer mixtures block copolymers of the type A B,A B A or also radial teleblock copolymers and socalled tapered block copolymers, i.e. block copolymers in which copolymers of the conjugated diene and the vinyl aromatic compound are present between the blocks.The block built up from the conjugated diene in all the types of block copolymers considered here may be fully or partly hydrogenated, in which case saturated block copolymers are obtained. In the block copolymers A B and A B A , B consists of a block of a conjugated diene, for example, butadiene, isoprene or pentadiene1,3, and blocks A and A consist of vinyl aromates, for example, styrene, alpha methylstyrene, vinyl toluene, vinyl xylene and or vinyl naphtalene. B preferably consists of polybutadiene and A and A preferably consist of polystyrene. Radial teleblock copolymers are to be understood to mean brancsal urbzjanf sigtex cbroyf which are formed by a polymer of a conjugated diene, preferably butadiene, blocks of a vinyl aromatic compound, preferably styrene and a coupling agent. In this copolymer structure, various chains of the diene polymer, usually three or more, start from a coupling agent in which each chain at its other end comprises a block of the aromatic vinylpolymer. All the said block copolymers are known per se.D. Polystyrene or rubber modified polystyrene. As a polystyrene there may be used a compound which contains more than 25 of units of a compound of the formula R C C6H s p zp CH2, wherein R is a hydrogen atom, a lower alkyl group having, for example, 1 6 carbon atoms or a halogen atom, Z is a hydrogen atom or a chlorine atom or a lower alkyl group or a vinyl group and p O or an integer from 1 to 5. suitable polystyrene compounds and suitable rubbermodified polystyrene compounds high impact polystyrene are homopolymers, for example, polystyrene itself, polychlorostyrene and poly alpha methyl styrene, rubber modified polystyrenes, for example, the commercially available high impact polystyrene polymers and also the styrene containing copolymers, for example, styrene acrylonitrile copolymers, styrene butadiene copolymers, styrene acrylonitrile butadiene terpolymers, copolymers of ethylvinylbenzene and divinylbenzene and the like. When the polymer mixture includes a polystyrene or a rubber modified polystyrene, the ratio between the quantity by weight of polyphenylene ether and polystyrene may be varied within wide limits, for example, between 1 4 and 20 1.E. Usual additives for polymer mixtures of polyphenylene ether. Examples of usual additives are dyes and pigments, agents to make the polymer mixture antistatic, agents to give the polymer mixture better flameretarding properties, stabilizers, fillers, reinforcing fibres and mineral oil. The articles according to the invention are manufactured according to usual techniques of processing synthetic resins, for example, by injection moulding, extrusion and the like. Layers of lacquer or adhesive on the basis of a polyurethane may be provided on the articles. Lacquers on the basis of an alkyd melamine system or epoxy adhesives may also be provided. Polyurethane lacquers or adhesives are to be understood to mean lacquers or adhesives which comprise urethane groups in the ultimate protective layer or in the ultimately formed compound. Urethane groups are formed by the reaction of an active hydrogen atom of a hydroxyl group with an isocyanate group. In most cases a polyurethane lacquer or adhesive consists of two components which are mixed with each other immediately before use. The two components are usually a prepolymer with isocyanate end groups and a resin with reactive OH groups. In Verfkroniek, 43 1970 , p. 269 276 are mentioned as examples of suitable reactive resins a. polyacrylate polyol b. polyester polyol c. polyether polyol The OH value of the lacquer or adhesive determines the ultimate degree of cross linking of the lacquer or adhesive. The lacquer or adhesive usually comprises one or more of the following solvents ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, toluene and xylene. Alkyd melamine lacquers are baking enamels. By raising the temperature baking , curing takes place.The two components, on the one hand the alkyd resin with free carboxyl groups and on the other hand the melamine resin with free OH groups, are supplied as one system. Suitable epoxy adhesives are two components systems which are mixed immediately before use. The main component is an epoxy resin having a given epoxy equivalent number, while the second component, the hardener , ensures curing by reaction with the epoxy group. In the examples hereinafter, thin, disk shaped plates are formed by injection moulding from the polymer mixtures mentioned therein. Lacquer layers and or adhesive layers on the basis of a polyurethane are provided on said plates. The bonding between the polyurethane lacquer layer if not otherwise stated is determined according to the so called Gitter schnittprufung von Anstrichen und ähnlichen Beschichtungen cross cut test on paint coatings and similar coatings according to DIN 53 151. The tests have been carried out with an Ericsen type 295 testing apparatus.By means of said testing apparatus, a pattern of squares is scratched in the coating layer. An adhesive tape is adhered across said pattern the tape is thoroughly pressed on. The adhesive tape is then pulled off. The appearance of the square pattern is then evaluated visually. With an evaluation Gto the coating layer is still fully intact. With an evaluation Gt5 more than 65 of the surface of the diamond pattern has worked loose. With intermediate evaluations Gtl, Gt2,Gt3, Gt4 a result getting worse and worse in this sequence is obtained. The bonding of the adhesive layer is determined as follows. A standardized tensile test bar is manufactured from the polymer mixtures by injection moulding. A PVC foil is adhered to the tensile test bar by means of adhesive example III . The adhesive is cured. The peel resistance is then determined N mm .The peel resistance is defined as the average force per length unit of the bonding line to further pull apart the two parts bonded together once the peeling has started. For this method of determining the peel resistance there may be referred to International Standard ISO 4578 1979 E and to DIN 53 282. In example IV the bonding of the adhesive is determined by adhering two tensile test bars together with an overlap of 1 cm.The force necessary to slide the tensile test bars parallel to each other is then measured as the peel resistance N mm2 .Example I Polymer mixtures were prepared samples A, B and C having a composition as stated in Table I hereinafter. From these mixtures, thin disc shaped plates were manufactured by injection moulding. The plates were lacquered under different conditions with three commercially available polyurethane lacquers by means of a spray gun. The bonding between the plates and the lacquer layer was determined after seven days according to the Gitterschnittprüfung cross cut test DIN 53151 . The lacquer conditions and the results obtained are recorded in Tables II, III, IV, V and VI herein after. The tests were always carried out in quintuplicate.

Lacquer I is a two components polyacrylate polyol isocyanate having an OH value of 4 , commercially available as Autocryl from Messrs. Sikkens.4. Lacquer II is a two components polyacrylate polyol isocyanate lacquer having an OH value of 4 , commer cially available as Cellioster 1834 from Messrs. La Celliose. It appears from the Tables that the conditions upon spraying the lacquers are of importance for the resulting bonding. In practice, however, it is of essential importance that a good bonding should also be obtained in less optimum conditions. It appears from the Tables that with the samples B and C according to the invention a better or equal result is obtained as with sample A reference sample .Example II. Two polymer mixtures were prepared corresponding to samples A and B of Table I. Diskshaped plates were manufactured from the polymer mixture by means of injection moulding. The plates were lacquered with a polyurethane lacquer under different conditions. As a polyurethane lacquer was used a twocomponents polyacrylatepolyol isocyanate lacquer obtainable as Cellioster 2400 Alu Nacre 3387 HU fromLa Celliose. All experiments were carried out in quintuplicate. The bonding strength was determined according to the Gitterschnitt test. Moreover the impact strength prior to and after painting was determined according to the so called falling dart impact test thickness disk 3.2 mm falling height 2.15 m mass 10.378 kg . The results are recorded in Table VII.

Standardized rods for a tensile test were manufactured from the resulting polymer mixtures by injection moulding. A PVC foil was adhered to the rods by means of a polyurethane adhesive, namely a twocomponents polyurethane adhesive of the tradename Hernerts 7550 . The glued joint was heated at 80 C for 5 minutes. After 5 days the peel resistance was determined. The results are recorded in Table IX hereinafter.
