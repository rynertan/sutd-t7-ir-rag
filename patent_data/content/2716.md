# Molten metal sampler.

## Abstract
A molten metal sampler employs two refractory mold halves having circular openings covered with plates to mold a disc sample and recesses communicating with the circular openings for fill passages and the formation of pin samples. The recesses in the mold halves when assembled provide integral fill and pin sample passages, a mixing chamber, deoxidant chamber, flow deflection and tortuous flow passage. The orientation of the fill passages and the recesses for the pin sample tube enable the mold to be positioned in a protective paperboard sleeve or box with one passage oriented to provide an end fill sample lance and the other passage serving as a pin sample mold. Alternatively, and in one embodiment, the pin sample mold can be employed as the fill passage by communicating through the side wall of a protective paperboard sleeve to provide a side fill immersion sampler.
