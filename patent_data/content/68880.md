# Photographic elements capable of providing oxoindolizine and oxoindolizinium dye compounds.

## Abstract
Oxoindolizine and oxoindolizinium dye compounds are formed in photograpic elements as image dyes. These dyes are formed in unexposed areas of photographic ele ments, especially photothermographic elements, by the reaction of a photosensitive cyclopropenone compound with a pyridine compound. Alternatively the resulting pro duct may be further reacted with a color forming coupler. The photographic element can be exposed and then heated to a processing temperature to form a dye image.
