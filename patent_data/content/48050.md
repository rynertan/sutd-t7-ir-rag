# Simultaneous expansion and cure of polyester resin composition.

## Abstract
Unsaturated polyester resin in solution in ethylenically unsaturated copolymerizable monomer is mixed with perox ide catalyst, organometallic promotor and certain hydrazine type or hydrazone compounds. The liquid mixture expands and cures to provide a solid foamed resin.
