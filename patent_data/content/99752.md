## Description
Production of N t alkylamides from t olefins or t alcohols This invention relates to a process for producing Nt alkylamides in high yield comprising reacting a combination of a tertiary olefin and water, and or a tertiary alcohol with a nitrile in the presence of sulfuric acid. It is known that N t alkylamides hereafter simply referred to as TAA are intermediates useful for producing mono tertiary alkylamines which are raw materials of organic rubber chemicals or medicines. For producing TAA, there have heretofore been known a process which comprises reacting tertiary olefins or tertiary alcohols and sulfuric acid with nitriles, generally in liquid phase, under such conditions that a molar ratio of sulfuric acid to the tertiary olefins or tertiary alcohols is 1 1 to 2 1 and the molar ratio of the nitriles to the tertiary olefins or tertiary alcohols is 0.5 1 to 1 1, at temperatures of 20 to 60 C to thereby prepare a TAA sulfuric acid addition product, then neutralizing the addition product with alkalis such as ammonia water or sodium hydroxide, etc. ano isolating TAA U.S. Patent ,773,097 and J. Amer. Chem, Soc., 70, 4045 1948 , and a process which comprises reacting tertiary olefins or tertiary alcohols with nitriles at temperatures of 50 to 2500C in a liquid phase whilst the molar ratio of the nitriles to the tertiary olefins or tertiary alcohols is 0.6 1 to 1 1, in the presence of a catalyst of a 1 to 20 wtt aqueous acid solution to obtain TAA U.S.Patent 2,457,660 . These processes are, however, extremely unsatisfactory as industrial production since, for example, in the process in which sulfuric acid is employed in an amount of 1 to 2 molar times that of the tertiary olefins or tertiary alcohols, an equimolar amount of an alkali is required for isolating TAA and further the process involves a problem that waste water after neutralization must be treated further in the process in which a 1 to 20 wt aqueous acid solution is employed, the yield of TAA is at best less than 20 mol , as is mentioned in the working examples thereof. In addition, a process using organic sulfonic acid type cation exchange resins hereafter simply referred to as IER as acid catalysts is described in U.S. atent 4,273,938 as a process for producing TAA. However, the life of the catalysts is extremely short because IER is poisoned by mono t alkylamines or ammonia formed by decomposition of TAA produced or by ammonia formed by hydrolysis of HCN or due to polymerization of olefins within pores of IER. Further taking into account the cost of IER, the process is extremely unsatisfactory as a process for producing TAA on an industrial scale. As a result of extensive investigations, attempting to improve the problems in these known processes and establish an excellent process for producing TAA on an industrial scale, the present inventors have devised the present invent ion. This invention provides a process for producing N t alkylamides which comprises reacting a combination of a tertiary olefin and water, and or a tertiary alcohol with a nitrile in the presence of sulfuric acid as an acid catalyst, with the molar ratio of sulfuric acid to the tertiary olefin and or tertiary alcohol being 0.05 1 to 0.8 1 and the molar ratio of the nitrile to the tertiary olefin and or tertiary alcohol being 1.5 1 to 10 1, respectively. Specific examples of tertiary olefins which can be employed in the process of this invention include isobutylene, 2 phenylpropene, 2 benzylpropene, 2methyl l butene, 2 methyl 2 butene, 2 methyl l pentene, 2methyl 2 pentene, 2 methyl l hexene, 2 methyl 2 hexene, 2methyl l heptene, 2 methyl 2 heptene, 2,4, trimethyl l pentene, 2,4,4 trimethyl 2 pentene. Specific examples of tertiary alcohols which can be employed in the process of this invention include t butyl alcohol, t amyl alcohol, 2 phenyl 2 propanol, l phenyl 2 methyl 2 propanol, 2 methyl 2 pentanol, 2methyl 2 hexanol, 2 methyl 2 heptanol, 2,4,4 trimethyl 2pentanol, 2,4 dimethyl 2 pentanol, fta dimethylbenzyl alcohol. Specific examples of nitriles include hydrocyanic acid, acetonitrile, acrylonitrile. It is preferred that the reaction temperature be 50 to 1500C, particularly 60 to 1000C. When the reaction temperature exceeds the above upper limit, the yield of TAA is lowered since not only TAA produced is liable to be decomposed to mono t alkylamines, further to tertiary olefins and or tertiary alcohols but also sulfuric acid is poisoned by the thus formed mono t alkvlamines or ammonia. Further when the reaction temperature is lower than the above lower limit, there is a tendency that the reaction rate becomes low and uneconomical. The reaction pressure is not particularly limited and can be sufficient to be not less than the vapor pressure of the reaction starting materials and reaction products.If the pressure is more than the vapor pressure, a gas inert to the reaction, such as nitrogen, may also be employed. It is necessary that sulfuric acid used in the process of this invention be in an amount of 0.05 to 0.8 molar, preferably 0.1 to 0.5 molar, that of the tertiary olefins and or tertiary alcohols.amount of sulfuric acid used is smaller than the above lower limit, the conversion of the reaction becomes undesirably low. If the amount of sulfuric acid used is larger than the above upper limit, although no particular disadvantage is met in performing the reaction, since costs for neutralization treatment and waste water treatment increase, such is not preferred from an economical viewpoint. It is appropriate that the nitriles used in the process of this invention be used in an amount of 1.5 to 10 molar, preferably 2 to 4 molar, that of the tertiary olefins and or tertiary alcohols. When the amount of the nitriles used is smaller than the above lower limit, side reactions such as. polymerization, etc. of the tertiary olefins occur much more so that selectivity of TAA becomes poor. Further when the amount of the nitriles used is too large, although no particular disadvantage appears in the reaction, it is not preferred from an economical viewpoint. Excessive amounts of the nitriles used in the process of this invention can be repeatedly employed after recovery since most of them remain unreacted after completion of the reaction. In case that the process of this invention is carri ed out using tertiary olefins as a starting material, an equimolar amount of water is theoretically require for the tertiary olefins in practice when tertiary olefins are employed as a starting material in the process of this invention, it is preferred that the amount of water be from 0.8 to 1.5 molar time that of the tertiary olefins. In case that the amount of water used is less than 0.8 molar time, since conversion of the reaction becomes low, such is not preferred. Further in case that the amount of water used exceeds 1.5 molar time, since concentration of sulfuric acid as a catalyst becomes too low so that not only progress of the reaction is delayed but also hydrolysis of the produced TAA occurs, such is not preferred. On the other hand, in case of carrying out the process of this invention using tertiary alcohols as a starting material, it is not specifically required to add water. However, there is no inconvenience even though water in an amount of not greater than 0.5 molar time that of the tertiary alcohols is present in the system.In case that the amount of water added exceeds 0.5 molar time, since progress of the reaction is delayed and hydrolysis of TAA occurs, such is not preferred. The tertiary olefins and water are equilibrated with the tertiary alcohols in an acidic condition in the present invention and therefore, it is equivalent to employing the tertiary alcohols to use the tertiary olefins and water as the starting materials. TAA obtained in accordance with the process of this invention can be taken out in a conventional manner such as phase separation, extraction or the like, after neutralizing sulfuric acid as a catalyst after completion of the reaction. Further, in case that mono t alkylamines are obtained by further hydrolyzing TAA, it is possible to isolate TAA once and then hydrolyze TAA with an alkali such as sodium hydroxide in a conventional manner alternatively, it is also possible to perform hydrolysis by adding an alkali to the reaction mixture obtained by the process of this invention from which TAA has not been isolated.It is preferred that an excess of the nitriles remaining in the reaction system obtained by the process of this invention be removed in advance in a conventional manner such as degasification, or distillation after completion of the reaction before hydrolysis of TAA is conducted. The process of this invention can be either batchwise or continuous. As described above, by performing the reaction in accordance with this invention, N t alkylamides can be obtained in high yield and the amount of alkali required for neutralization and treatment of waste water can be greatly minimized and therefore, the process of this invention is extremely useful from an industrial viewpoint. Hereafter this invention will be described in more detail with reference to the examples but is not deemed to be limited thereto.
