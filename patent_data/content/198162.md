# Frequency converter used for a receiver which receives signals of a UHF band or a microwave band.

## Abstract
A frequency converter which is capable of rejecting unnecessary signal generated by image signals. The fre quency converter has first and second local oscillation cir cuits 1, 2 which generate local oscillation signals whose frequencies are the same and whose phases are different by 90 degrees from each other, has two mixer circuits 7, 8 , and has a hybrid coupler 9 . The mixer circuits 7, 8 generate two unnesserary signals whose phases are dif ferent by 90 degrees from each other. The hybrid coupler 9 delays one unnecessary signal by a quarter of the wavelength to generate two unnecessary signals whose phases are different by 180 degrees from each other, so that they are cancelled by each other.
