# A METHOD FOR COUPLING THE END SECTION OF AN OPTICAL FIBER CABLE TO AN OPTICAL CONNECTOR

## Abstract
A method for coupling the end section of an optical fiber cable 2 to an optical connector 4 with a through hole, the optical fiber cable 2 having a core 8 and a silicone cladding 10 covered with a jacket layer 12 , comprises the steps of peeling off the jacket layer 12 for a predetermined length from an end of the optical fiber cable 2 along the axial to direction thereof to expose the silicone cladding 10 , insert ing an exposed portion of the silicone cladding into a deform able sleeve member 14 , and compressing the sleeve mem ber 14 to bring the sleeve member 14 into tight contact with the exposed silicone cladding 10 , and inserting the silicone cladding 10 and the part of the jacket layer 12 into the through hole of the optical connector 4 after an adhesive 16 is applied to the outer surface of the sleeve member 14 and or the inner surface of the through hole of the optical connector 4 , and adhering the sleeve member 14 to the optical connector 4 , thereby coupling the end section of the optical fiber cable 2 to the optical connector 4 . The sleeve member 14 is brought into tight contact with the silicone cladding 10 , and the sleeve member 14 is secured to the optical connector 4 by the adhesive 16 , whereby the end section of the optical fiber cable 2 is rigidly fixed to the optical connector.
