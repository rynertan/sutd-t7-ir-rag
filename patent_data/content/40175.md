# Machine for automatically tying knots by means of a string on a gut stuffed with meat.

## Abstract
The machine comprises an assembly for squeezing the bowel gut over a given stretch prior to tying, a spool unit 6 comprising the spool 7 carrying the string reserve which, in turn, is enclosed within a housing 11 which is movable with the axis arranged in parallel with the axis of feed of the bowel, a mechanism 13 having an orifice 18 for the passage of the bowel and a hook shaped component for the passage there through of the spool unit 6 , said mechanism 13 carrying elements 21 for momentarily supporting a polygon of string, as well as an axially moving element 22 for detaching said polygon from the supporting elements 21 . The use of a mechanism 13 mounted such as to rotate at one end in order to wind the string around the bowel, and a spool unit 6 for linearly dispensing the string permits tying in a spiral direction, as well as a simpler design of the machine.
