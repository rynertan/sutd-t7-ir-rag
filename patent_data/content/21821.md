# Apparatus and method for trimming strip material.

## Abstract
Edge trimming apparatus for trimming off wavy edges 1 of strip material 3 , e.g. metal strip, wherein rotary trimming knives 9, 11 for each edge 1 of the strip 3 are movable transversely relative to the advancing strip 3 . The knifes 9, 11 are pivotally supported about vertical axis 29 and can have their transverse spacing adjusted, the support blocks 31 preferably being transversely slidable in guides 33 which are mounted on a carriage 35 which itself is transversely movable relative to the advancing strip 3 . Edge sensors are located adjacent edge regions of the strip 3 and signals from the sensors are passed to a device, for example a hydraulic jack 45 , for moving the carriage 35 transversely. Preferably the support blocks 31 are adjustable by means of an electric motor 39 and a screw threaded shaft 37 connected to the motor 39 and passing through the blocks 31 . The trimmer knives 9,11 may be supported on trimmer heads 13 pivotally connected by links 27 to the support blocks 31 and themselves adjustably spaced apart by means of a threaded tie rod passing through sleeves pivotally connected to the heads 13 . In a preferred arrangement the transverse adjustment mechanism is located beneath the trimmer heads 13 and if desired the trimmer heads 13 may be rotatable and carry spare sets of knives.
