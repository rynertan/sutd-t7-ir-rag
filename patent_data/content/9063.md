# Parallel plate electromagnetic lens.

## Abstract
An electromagnetic lens for a commutated scanning beam antenna has a plurality of petal shaped parallel plate segments 50 , connected in series, with the first petal shaped segment adapted to receive power at its input edge through an array of input probes connected, in a commuta tive switching arrangement, to a radio frequency transmit ter. The last petal shaped segment of the lens is formed into a radiating aperture or is connected to a linear array of radiating elements. Various techniques for determining petal shapes and for connecting together the petals are discussed. Stacked and folded lenses are described.
