# Purification of tertiary butyl hydroperoxide containing primary and secondary alkyl hydroperoxide contaminants.

## Abstract
Purifying tertiary butyl hydroperoxide containing minor amounts of primary and secondary alkyl hydroperoxide contaminants obtained by the oxidation of isobutane by contacting the tertiary butyl hydroperoxide with at least about 2 milli equivalents per gram of total hydroperoxide present of a hydroxide or an oxide of an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal in aqueous solution and recovering the desired tertiary butyl hydroperoxide containing substantially reduced concentrations of primary and secondary alkyl hydroperoxide contaminants.
