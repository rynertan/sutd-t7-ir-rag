# Steam bonding of solid lignocellulosic material.

## Abstract
Composite products 34 are formed, such as of ligno cellulosic particles, by bonding through the transformation of added sugars and or starches together with lignin and or other phenolic containing materials, with the optional pre sence of added catalyst, the transformation causing the composition to convert into a furan lignin type binder in situ by heat and pressure. The bonding composition is suitably activated by contact with live steam.
