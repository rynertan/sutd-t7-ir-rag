# Method for preparation of N phosphonomethylglycine.

## Abstract
A method for the preparation of N phosphono methylglycine which comprises the steps of 1 reacting 1,3,5 tris alkoxy or aryloxy substituted carbonylmethyl hexahydro s triazine, with a substituted phosphorus com pound having the formula PXYZ wherein X is a halogen, Y and Z are independently selected from the group consisting of halogen, alkoxy having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, and aryloxy, in the presence of a protic acid and a low molecular weight carboxylic acid 2 heating said reactants to a temperature ranging from 10 to 25 C for a sufficient period of time to cause the formation of an N phosphono methylglycine ester and 3 hydrolyzing said phospho nomethylglycine ester to N phosphonomethylglycine.
