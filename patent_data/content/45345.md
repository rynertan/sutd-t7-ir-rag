# Method of fabrication and resulting birefringent electromagnetic transmission line that preserves the state of polarized radiation propagating therein.

## Abstract
A method of fabrication and the resulting structure for a birefringent transmission line having particular application as an optical waveguide. The instant transmission line is fabricated so as to be adapted to maintain the state e.g. the polarization vector of polarized electromagnetic radiation propagating therethrough. Birefringence in the instant trans mission line is geometrically generated by producing oblong regions having different indices of refraction through a cross section of the transmission line. A preferred technique by which to generate birefringence includes the method step of bombarding the transmission line with a supply of atomic particules, such as energetic hydrogen ions, whereby to implant a damaged region of oblong cross section and thereby cause an internal swelling therein. By way of a preferred example, the transmission line herein described may be a single mode optical fiber.
