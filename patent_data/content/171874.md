# Linear feedback shift register for circuit design technology validation.

## Abstract
An apparatus and process employing an integrated circuit device technology within a linear feedback shift register using a cyclic redundancy check code scheme for validating the device technology under realistic very large scale integrated circuit operating conditions. By deploying two feedback shift registers in a full duplex mode, the device technology can be subjected to arbitrarily long, pseudo random test signal sequences. Also, by checking the regis ters with variable phase pulses, representative device delay time information can be obtained.
