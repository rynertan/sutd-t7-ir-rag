# Dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons with selective oxidation of hydrogen thereby generated.

## Abstract
A mixture containing unconverted dehydrogenatable hydrocarbon s , dehydrogenated unsaturated hydrocar bon s , hydrogen and steam such as is obtained as effluent mixture from the dehydrogenation of dehydrogenatable hydrocarbons with a dehydrogenation catalyst comprising a modified iron compound in the presence of steam in a multicatalyst bed system is contacted with an oxidation catalyst whereby hydrogen is selectively oxidized in prefer ence to the unconverted and dehydrogenated hydrocarbons. The selective oxidation catalyst which is used comprises a noble metal of Group VIII of the Periodic Table, a metal of Group IVA, a metal of Group IA or IIA composited on an alumina support which has been calcined prior to impregna tion with those metallic components at a temperature in the range of from about 900 to about 1500 C in the absence or presence of steam to provide a catalyst which possesses increased stability and activity when compared to prior catalysts. The selective oxidation of hydrogen improves the combustion thereof and supplies the necessary heat which is required for a subsequent dehydrogenation treatment.
