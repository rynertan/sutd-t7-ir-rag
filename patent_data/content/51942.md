# SURFACE ACOUSTIC WAVE FILTER

## Abstract
A surface acoustic wave filter which comprises a substrate of piezoelectric material a multistrip coupler for changing the track of a signal comprising a plurality of parallel conductive strips at least two transducers disposed on one side of said multistrip coupler at least another two transducers disposed on the other side of said multistrip coupler. The latter two transducers facing the former two transducers. One pair of said transducers which face each other through said multistrip coupler constitutes input transducers while the other pair of said transducers constitutes output transducers.
