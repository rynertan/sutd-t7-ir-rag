## Description
LIQUID DETERGENT COMPOSITION CONTAINING NONIONIC A,9 COSMIC oURFACTANTS Keith A. Jones Eugene J. Pancheri Cheeyoung Suh Technical Field and Background Art The invention relates to aqueous high sudsing liquid detergent compositions containing specified amounts and types of surfactants especially useful in the washing of tableware, kitchenware and other hard surfaces. The compositions of this invention provide more complete drainage of rinse water from surfaces such as glass, ceramics and metal, thereby reducing spotting and filming, particularly in a dishwashing procedure that involves drain drying without towel drying and polishing. The performance of a detergent composition for cleaning glasses1 dishes, and other articles with a normally shiny surface is evaluated by the consumer in terms of shine and the absence of filming, streaking, and spotting. The liquid dishwashing detergent compositions presently on the market are designed to remove the soils from glasses, dishes, and other tableware and kitchen utensils. The detergent solution and redeposited soil residues are normally removed from the washed articles by rinsing and optionally by towel drying the articles when they are still wet. If not rinsed and towel dried, these residues can dry upon the surfaces of the washed articles1 leaving films, streaks, or spots. Even when such articles are entirely clean but rinsed in plain water containing dissolved salts such as water hardness, spots and streaks can appear on the washed and rinsed surfaces upon evaporation of the water Towel drying of washed articles, e.g., glasses and dishes, immediately after removal from the washing and rinsing solution, is undesirable from the standpoints of convenience and hygiene. Therefore, it is common practice to put the washed or washed and rinsed articles aside for draining and air drying. Consequently, the cleaning efficacy of the product used, which the housewife may have visually appreciated at the end of the washing or rinsing cycle, is diminished due to the adherence of redeposited soil, residual dried detergent, and water hardness residues. U.S. Patent 3,963,649, Spadini et al, discloses liquid detergent compositions containing a nonionic surfactant and a water soluble gel forming gelatin. These compositions are said to minimize filming, streaking and spotting of tableware and kitchen utensils. The essential nonionic surfactant may be a tertiary amine or phosphine oxide, an amide or a condensation product of ethylene oxide and an organic hydrophobic compound. U.S. Patent 3,983,079, Spadini et al, discloses dishwashing detergent compositions said to have good rinse water draining characteristics The compositions contain a water soluble quaternary ammonium compound, a nonionic surfactant containing both ethylene oxide and propylene oxide and a sultaine or betaine zvertterionic surfactant. U.S. Patent 4,144,201, Winterbotham et al, discloses liquid dishwashing detergent compositions containing soluble casein to improve drain dry and mildness properties. Belgium Patent 845,184 discloses liquid and granular dishwashing detergent compositions containing one or more specified classes of surfactants to ensure rapid drainage and provide a shiny surface. Eurcran patent ap2licatian 0 034 039, ppl Âµhed 19.08.1981, discloses the drainage promoting nonionic surfactant disclosed hereinafter. It is an object of the present invention to provide liquid detergent compositions and a process for dishwashing that promote rapid and relatively complete drainage of rinse water thereby reducing spotting and filming on surfaces such as glass, ceramics and metal. There is a continuing need for compositions and methods which can be employed during dishwashing operations to improve the final dry appearance of washed and dried kitchen utensils and articles. If such compositions and methods are intended to be useful for conventional dishwashing soil removal operations, there is a continuing need for a compatible combination of materials which will simultaneously provide the surfactancy, sudslng, and mildness attributes of an acceptable dishwashing detergent composition as well as the anti spotting and anti filming benefits described above. Summary of the Invention The present invention comprises a liquid detergent composition containing by weight a from about 5 to about 50 of an anionic surfactant b from about i to about 20 of a drainage promoting non ionic surfactant selected from the group consisting of i an ethoxylated aliphatic alcohol of the formula R OC2H4 nOH wherein R is an aliphatic hydrocarbyl radical containing from about 16 to about 30 carbon atoms1 wherein n is from about 16 to about 100 ii an ethoxylated alkyl phenol of the formula R OC2H4 nOH wherein R is an alkyl phenyl radical containing a total of from about 18 to about 30 carbon atoms and at least one alkyl group containing at least about 12 carbon atoms wherein n is from about 16 to about 100 iii the condensation product of mono C16 22 fatty acid esters of polyglycols with from about 13 to about 100 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of the mono ester iv the condensation product of cholesterol and from about 13 to about 100 moles of ethylene oxide v a material which is a condensate of ethylene oxide1 propylene oxide and a compound containing hydroxy or amine groups onto which alkylene oxides can be polymerized, said polymer having a molecular weight of from about 500 to about 15,000, an ethylene oxide content of from about 30 to about 70 by weight and a propylene oxide content of from about 30 to about 70 by weight and vi mixtures thereof c from about 38 to about 308, preferably from about 18 to about 20 of an alkylpolysaccharide surfactant having the the formula 0 tax wherein Z is a moiety derived from a reducing saccharide containing from 5 to 6 carbon atoms, preferably a glucose, galactose, glucosyl, or galactosyl residue or mixtures thereof R is a hydrophobic group selected from the group consisting of alkyl, alkyl phenyl, hydroxyalkyl phenyl or hydroxy alkyl groups or mixtures thereof in which said alkyl groups contain from about 8 to about 20 carbon atoms preferably from about 10 to about 16 carbon atoms, most preferably from about 12 to about 14 carbon atoms R contains from 2 to 4 carbdn atoms, preferably ethylene, propylene and or glyceryl, t is from 0 to about 30, preferably 0 to about 10, most preferably 0 wherein x is a number from about 1.5 to about 10, preferably 1.5 to 4, most preferably 1.6 to 2.7 and d from about 0 to about 10 of a suds stabilizing non ionic surfactant selected from the group consisting of asides, amine oxides and mixtures thereof e from 0 to about 10 of a detergency builder selected from inorganic phosphates, polyphosphates, silicates, and carbonates, organic carboxylates, phosphonates and mixtures thereof and f from about 20 to about 88 water.

Other ethoxylated nonionic surfactants at a level of from about l to about 20 can provide the drainage promoting characteristics of ethoxylated alcohols1 but are less desirable for reasons of biodegradability and effect on sudsing or cleaning performance. Examples of such alternate ethoxylated nonionic surfactants are 1 an ethoxylated alkyl phenol of the formula R OC2H4 nOH wherein R is an alkyl phenyl radical containing a total of from about 18 to about 30 carbon atoms and at least one alkyl group containing at least about 12 carbon atoms wherein n is from about 16 to about 100 2 the condensation product of mono C16 22 fatty acid esters of polyglycols with from about 13 to about 100 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of partial ester 3 the condensation product of cholesterol and from about 13 to about 100 moles of ethylene oxide 4 a material which is a condensate of ethylene oxide, propylene oxidc and a compound containing hydroxy or amine groups onto which the alkylene oxides can be polymerized, said polymer havlng a molecular weight of from about 500 to about 15,000, an ethylene oxIde content of from about 30t lo about 0 by weight and a propylene oxide content of from about 308 to about 7 1 by weight. tn a particularly preferred embodiment an aliphatic alcohol containing from about 16 to 22 carbon atoms is ethoxylated to an average degree of from about 18 to about 50 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of alcohol. The Alkylpolysaccharide Surfactant The alkylpolysaccharides are those having a hydrophobic group containing from about 8 to about 20 carbon atoms, preferably from about 10 to about iG carbon atoms, most preferably from 12 to t4 carbon atoms, and a polysaccharide hydrophilic group containing from about I 1 5 to about io, preferably from about 1.5 to about 9, most preferably from 1.6 to 2.7 saccharide units e.g., galactoside, glucoside,fructoside, glucosyl, fructosyl andlor galactosyl units . Mixtures of saccharide moieties may be used in the alkyl polysaccharide sur factants. The number x indicates the number of saccharide units in a particular alkylpolysaccharide surfactant.For a particular alkylpolysaccharide molecule x can only assume integral values. in any physical sample of alkylpolysaccharide surfactants there will in general be molecules having different x values. The physical sample can be characterized by the aer age value of x and this average value can assume non integral values. In this specification the values of x are to be understood to be average values. The hydrophobic group R can be attached at the 2 , 3 , or 4 positions rather than at the 1position, tthus giving e.g. a glucosyl or galactosyl as opposcd to a glucoside or galactoside . However, attachment through the 1 position, i.e., glucosides, galactosides, fructosides, etc. is preferred.In the preferred product the additional saccharide units are predominately attached to the previous saccharide unit s 2 position. Attachment through the 3 , 4 , and 6positions can also occur. Optionally and less desirably there can be a polyalkoxide chain joining the hydrophobic moiety R and the polysaccharide chain. The preferred alkoxide moiety is ethoxide. Typical hydrophobic groups include alkyl groups, either saturated or unsaturated, branched or unbranched containing from about 8 to about 20, preferably froin about 10 to about 16 carbon atoms. Preferably, the alkyl group is a straight chain saturated alkyl group The alkyl group can contain up two 3 hydroxy groups andlor the polyalkoxide chain can contain top to about 30, preferably less than 10, most preferably 0, alkoxide moieties. Suitable alkyl polysaccharides are decyl, dodecyl, tetradecyl, hexadecyl, and octadecyl, di , trl , tetra , penta , and hexaglucosides, galactosides, lactosides, fructosides, fructosyls, lactosyls, glucosyls and or galactosyls and mixtures thereof. The alkylmonosaccharides are relatively less soluble in water than the higher alkylpolysaccharides. When used in admixture with alkylpolysaccharides, the alkylmonosaccharides are solubilized to some extent. The use of alkylmonosaccharides in admixture with a Ikylpolysaccha rides Is a preferred mode of carrying out the invention. Suitable mixtures include coconut alkyl, di , tri , tetra , and pentaglucosides and tallow alkyl tetra , penta , and hexaglucosides. The preferred alkyl polysaccharides are alkyl polyglucosides having the formula R2O CnH2nO t Z x wherein Z is derived from glucose, R2 is a llydrophobic group selected from. the group consisting of alkyl, alkylphenyl, hydroxyalkyl, hydroxyalkylphenyl, and mixtures thereof In which said alkyl groups contain from about 10 to about 18, preferably from 12 to 14 carbon atoms n is 2 or 3, preferably 2, t is from 0 to about 10, preferably 0 and x is from about 1.5 to about 8, preferably from about 5.5 to about 4, most preferably from 1.6 to 2.7.The prepare these compounds a long chain alcohol R2OH can be reacted with glucose, in the presence of an acid catalyst to form the desired glucoside,Alternatively the alkylpolyglucosides can be prepared by a two step procedure in which a short chain alcohol C1 6 is reacied with glucose or a polyglucoside x 2 to 4 to yield a short chain alkyl glucoside x 2 to 4 which can in turn be reacted with a ionger chain alcohol R2Ofl to displace the short. chain alcohol and obtain the desired alkylpolyglucoside. if this two St p procedure is used, the shurt chain alkylgiucoside content of tha final alkylpolyglucoside material should be less than 50 , preferably less than 10 , more preferably less than 5 , most preferably 0t of the alkylpolyglucoside. The amount of unreacted alcohol the frec fatty alcohol content in the desired alkylpolysaccharide surfactant is preferably less than about 2 , more preferably less than about 0.5 by weight of the total of the alkyl polysaccharide plus unreacted alcohol. The amount of alkyimonosaccharide is about 20 to about 708, preferably 25 to 60 , most preferably 30 to to 50 by weight of the total of the alkylpolysaccharide. For some uses it is desirable to have the alkylmonosaccharide content less than about 10 . As used herein, alkylpolysaccharide surfactant is intended to represent both the preferred glucose and galactose derived surfactants and the less preferred alkylpolysaccharide surfactants. Throughout this specification, alkylpolyglucoside Is used to include alkylpolyglycosides because the stcrc o chemistry of the saccharide moiety is changed during the preparation reaction. The amount of alkylpolysaccharide surfactant is from about 4 to about 20 , preferably from about 1 to about 70 , most preferably from about 2 to about 10 . Suds Stabilizing Nonionic Surfactant The compositions of this invention can contain from 0 to about 10 , preferably from about 1 to about 8 , of suds stabilizing nonionic surfactant or mixtures thereof having a different chemical structure and function than the essential drainage promoting nonionic surfactant and a different chemical structure than the alkylpolysaccharide surfactant. Suds stabilizing nonionic surfactants operable in the instant compositions are two basic types amides and the amine oxide semipolar nonlonics. The amide type of nonionic surface active agent include the ammonia, mono and diisopropanol, and mono and diethanol amides of fatty acids having an acyl moiety of from about 8 to about 18 carbon atoms and represented by the general formula R1 CO N H m 1 R2OH 3 m wherein R1 Is a saturated or unsaturated, aliphatic hydrocarbon radical having from 7 to 21, preferably from 11 to 17 carbon atoms R2 represents a ethylene or ethylene group and m is 1, 2, or 3, preferably 1 or 2. Specific examples of said amides are mono ethanol coconut fatty acid amide and diethanol dodecyl fatty acid amide.These acyl moieties may be derived from naturally occurring glycerides, e.g., coconut oil, palm oil, soybean oil and tallow, but can be derived synthetically, e,g., by the oxidation of petroleum, or hydrogenation of carbon monoxide by the Fischer Tropsch process. The monoethanol amides and diethanolamides of C12 14 fatty acids are preferred. Amine oxide semi potar non ionic surface active agents comprise compounds and mixtures of compounds leaving the formula EMI12.1 wherein R1 is an alkyl, 2 hydroxyalkyl, 3 hydroxyalkyl, or 3 alkoxy 2 hydroxypropyl radical in wllicll the alkyl and alkoxy, respectively, contain from about 8 to about 18 carbon atoms, and R3 are methyl, ethyl a propyl, isopropyl, 2 hydroxyethyl.2 hydroxypropyl, or 3 hydroxypropyl and n is from 0 to about 10. Particularly preferred are amine oxides of the formula EMI12.2 wherein R1 Is a C10 1Y alkyl and R2 and R3 are methyl or ethyl. The preferred sudsing characteristics of the composltions of the Invention are those which will provide the user of the product with an indication of cleaning potential In a dlshwashlnq solution. Soils encountered in dishwashing act as suds depressants and the presence or absence of suds from the surface of a dishwashing solution is a convenient guide to product usage. Mixtures of anionic surfactants and suds stabilizing nonionic surfactants are utIlized In the compositions of the invention because of their high sudsing characteristics, their suds stability in the presence of food soils and their ability to indicate accurately an adequate level of product usage in the presence of soil.Additionally, and most importantlt, compositions containing the other two essential surfactants of the invention but not the suds stabilizing nonionic surfactants as defined herein, do not provide an optimum draining promoting effect. In preferred embodiments of the invention, the ratio of anionic surfactants to total nonionic surfactants in the composition will be in a molar ratio of from about 11 1 to about 1 1, and more preferably from about 8 1 to about 2 1. From the standpoint of sudsing, the suds stabilizing nonionic surfactants are generally preferred, but the essential relatively highly ethoxylated drainage promoting nonionic surfactants of the invention can contribute to sudsing performance and are included in the calculation of ratios of anionic to nonionic surfactant. Other Optional Surfactants The compositions of the invention may contain optional surfactants such as ampholytic, zwitterionic and cationic surfactants. Ampholytic surfactants can be broadly described as derivatives of aliphatic amines which contain a long chain of about 8 to 18 carbon atoms and an anionic water solubilizing group, e.g., carboxy, sulfo or sulfate. Examples of compounds falling within this definition are sodium 3 dodecylamino propane sulfonate, and dodecyl dimethylammonium hexanoate. Zwltterionic surface active agents operable in the instant composition are broadly described as internally neutl alized derivatives of aliphatic quaternary ammonium and phosphonium and tertiary sulfonium compounds In which the aliphatic radical can be straight chain or branched, and wherein one of the aliphatic substituents contains from about 8 to 18 carbon atoms and one contains an anionic water solubilizing group, e.g., carboxy, sulfo, sulfato, phosphato, or phospllono. Cationic surfactants such as quaternary ammonium compounds can find optional use in the practlce of the invention to tlre extent they are compatible with the other surfactants In the particular composition. Water The compositions of this invention contain from about 20 to about 88 , preferably from about 40 to about 70 , water. Additional Optional Ingredients The compositions of this invention can contain up to about 10 , by weight of detergency builders either of the organic or inorganic type. Examples of water soluble inorganic builders which can be used, alone or in admixture with themselves and organic alkaline sequestrant builder salts, are alkali metal carbonates, phosphates, polyphosphates, and silicates. Specific examples of such salts are sodium tripolyphosphate, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium pyrophnsphate, potassium pyrophosphate, potassium tripolyphosphate, and sodium hexametaphosphate.Examples or organic builder salts which can be used alone, or in admixture with each other or with the preceding inorganic alkaline builder salts, are alkali metal polycarboxylates, e.g., water soluble citrates such as sodium and potassium citrate, sodium and potassium tartrate, sodium and potassium ethylenediaminetetraacetate, sodium and potassium N 2 hydroxyethyl ethylenediamine triacetates, sodium and potassium nitrilotriacetates NTA and sodium and potassiumN 2 hydroxyethyl nitri lodiacetates. Other organic detcrgenc.y builders such as water soluble phosphonates can find use in the compositlons of the invention.In general, however, detergency builders have limited value in dishwashing detergent compositions and use at levels above about 10 can restrict formulation flexibility in liquid compositions because of solubility and phase stability considerations. Alcohols, such as ethyl alcohol, and hydrotropes, such as sodium and potassium toluene sulfonate, sodium and potassium xylene sulfonate, trisodium sulfosuccinate and related compounds as disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,915,903, incorporated herein by reference and urea, can be utilized in the interests of achieving a desired product phase stability and viscosity. Ethyl alcohol at a level of from about 3 to about 15 and potassium or sodium toluene, xylene or cumene sulfonate at a level of from about 18 to about 6 are particularly useful In the compositions of the invention. The detergent compositions of this invention can contain, if desired, any of the usual adjuvants, diluents and additives, for example, perfumes, enzymes, dyes, antitarnishing agents, antimicrobial agents, and the like, without detracting from the advantageous properties of the compositions. Alkalinity sources and pH buffering agents such as monoethanolamil triethanolamine and alkali metal hydroxides can also be utilized. The following examples are given to illustrate the compositions of the invention. All percentages, parts and ratios are by weight unless otherwise Indicated.

C12 alkanol ethoxylate 20 6. C18 alkanol ethoxylate 20 Comparable sudsing, appearance, filming and spotting performances are obtained.
