# High density, high voltage FET.

## Abstract
Lateral FET structure is disclosed with an insulative region 110 such as porous silicon filled with oxide formed in the drift region 150 to divert the drift region 150 current path and increase the length thereof to afford higher OFF state blocking voltage without increasing lateral dimen sions. Combinations involving bidirectional power switch ing structures are also disclosed, as well as a multicell matrix array.
