# Matrix logic circuit network suitable for large scale integration.

## Abstract
A matrix logic circuit network comprises a great number of interconnected logic gates, input and output lines of the logic gates are arranged in the matrix array. By rearranging the input and output lines of the matrix in accordance with a sort algorithm, direct connection points of the input and output lines to which the same signals are allotted and connecting el ements forming logic gates located at given intersections of the input and output lines are arranged within a diagonal area with a limited width, which extends along a diagonal line of the matrix.
