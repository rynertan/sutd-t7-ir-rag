# Method of fabricating small orifice fuel injector.

## Abstract
A method for forming small orifices 20 in the face plate 10 of an injector 12, especially a liquid propellant injector for a rocket engine. A stainless steel base plate is given a first layer 28 of electrodeposited N1 and fuel feed passages 24 and 26, respectively, are formed therethrough for fuel and oxidizer transfer. The feed passages 24 and 26 are filled with wax and silver is worked into the surface of the wax to permit elec trodeposition of face plate 10. Connecting bores 42 to the perforations are made through the face plate nickel layer 40. Plastic mandrels 44 are fabricated, having legs 46 with sup port sections 48 and orifice forming sections 50 and coupling tabs 54 for tying the legs 46 together. The support legs 48 of the mandrels 44 are inserted in the connecting bores for sup port and another layer 60 of Ni is electrodeposited to enclose the orifice forming sections 50 of the mandrel legs 46. The uncovered tabs 54 of the mandrels 44 are machined off and the legs of the mandrels 44 are dissolved, leaving properly sized and oriented orifices and ducts extending from the sur face 16 of the face plate to the fuel and oxidizer passages 24 and 26 within.
