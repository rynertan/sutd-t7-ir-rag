# A method for calcite coating on the inner surface of pipes.

## Abstract
A method is described for obtaining a tenacious in si tu coating deposition of calcite on the inner surface of wa ter pipes. The calcite coating method according to the pre sent invention has an advantage that it is able to maintain a completely corrosion free system during the coating, thus assisting the formation of a protective coating of good bonding bonding properties. The method consists in the incorporation of a reagent selected from the group consisting of alkali metal sulfite and hydrazine, in an amount which is at least the stochio metrically required to deoxygenate the aqueous solution utilized for said coating, which is supersaturated with re spect to calcium carbonate having a dissolved calcium and carbonate levels of above 100 ppm. The calcite producing ingredients are supplied to the water stream in quantities supplementing concentrations available in the natural water used, giving the required supersaturation levels by addition of suitable salts. The calcite coating can be successfully applied to lar ge diameter mains and pipes by utilizing a large recycle ratio. The coating has in particular an improved adherence on the wall of the pipes, when the water is delivered at a flow velocity of above 1.5 m sec.
