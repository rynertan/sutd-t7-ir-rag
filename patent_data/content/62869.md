# A RIVETING MACHINE OPERATING THROUGH INCLINED PLANES FOR APPLYING A TRACTIVE FORCE TO A RIVET PIN

## Abstract
A novel riveting machine 10 comprises a conventional pin gripping unit or assembly for gripping a pin 2 of a rivet 1 two elements 34,36 which may be rotated relative to each other said elements having opposite faces 50, 52 with inclined surfaces and balls 60 between said inclined surfaces. The mutual rotation of the elements allows for the opening and closing of the gripping jaws on the pin of a rivet and the application of a tractive force to said pin by a limited effort.
