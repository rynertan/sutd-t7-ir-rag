## Description
Treatment of Diarrhoea The present invention relates to the treatment of diarrhoea and to compositions for use in such treatment. Diarrhoea also referred to as scours in cattle, sheep and pigs can be a severe disease particularly in young animals and can often result in death. Diarrhoea is also common amongst human travellers and those exposed to low standards of hygiene. The diarrhoea frequently involves colonisation of the small intestine with enteropathogenic strains of E. coli which produce heat stable and or heat labile enterotoxins. Related enterotoxins are produced by other enteropathogens, for example, cholera, and also cause diarrhoea. These enterotoxins stimulate fluid secretion in the gut lumen and hence cause diarrhoea. The associated fluid loss may lead to loss of condition, reduced weight gain of livestock and often to death. It has now been found that a class of sympathomimetic amines and salts thereof have properties useful in the treatment of diarrhoea. In particular the compounds reduce dehydration caused by hypersecretory diarrhoeas, such as E. coli scours, when administered orally. Accordingly the present invention provides a method for treating diarrhoea in humans and other mammals which method comprises the oral administration to a human or other mammal suffering from diarrhoea of an effective, non toxic amount of a sympathomimetic phenylethylamine derivative having 2 adrenoceptor agonist activity. According to a particular aspect the present invention provides a method for treating diarrhoea which method comprises the oral administration to a human or other mammal suffering from diarrhoea of a compound of formula I EMI2.1 wherein R1 is hydrogen or hydroxy Rê is hydrogen or methyl R3 is hydrogen or methyl is is hydrogen, meta hydroxy or orthomethoxy is is hydrogen, para hydroxy or meta methoxy or a salt thereof provided that the compound has some a2 adrenergic agonist activity. As used herein oral administration includes administration via a stomach tube. An a2 adrenergic agonist is a compound which is capable of displacing some tritiated clonidine from specific receptors in brain preparations. For example the compound is epinephrine, norepinephrine, nordefrin, metaraminol, phenylephrine, hydroxyamphetamine, methoxamine, methamphetamine, ephidrine, phenylpropanolamine and mephentermine. Preferably the compound is epinephrine, norepinephrine or metaraminol. Suitable salts include the mono and di salts of the following acids, i.e.hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydroiodic, tartaric, citric and ascorbic acid. It has been found particularly advantageous to combine the above method of treatment with oral rehydration therapy. Accordingly the present invention provides, in a particular aspect, a method for treating diarrhoea which method comprises the oral administration to a human or other mammal suffering from diarrhoea of an effective non toxic amount oF a phenylethylamine derivative especially a compound of formula I as hereinbefore defined and an oral rehydration composition comprising a pharmacologically acceptable aqueous solution containing at least 0.5 w v of an actively absorbed monosaccharide, at least 25 mM sodium ions and having an osmolarity less than 500 m Osmolar. Preferably the oral rehydration composition further comprises actively absorbed amino acids and electrolytes. Active absorption or active transport is well known to the skilled man, as are the monosaccharides and amino acids which are actively absorbed. In this regard the reader is referred to standard text books such as Medicinal Physiology by Guyton published by W.B.Saunders and Company 4th Edition pages 769 to 771.Of course whether or not a particular monosaccharide or amino acid is actively absorbed may also readily be determined by experiment as for example described in WilsonT.H. 1962 Intestinal Absorption Saunders, Philadelphia . To be actively absorbed, monsaccharides must have a at least six carbon atoms in their chain b aD pyranose ring structure and c an intact hydroxyl group at carbon 2. Thus suitable examples of monosaccharides for use in this invention include the naturally occurring D pyranoses such as glucose and galactose. Other examples of suitable monosaccharides include naturally occurring D pyranoses that have been chemically modified whilst retaining the necessary structural features a , b and c . Examples of such modified monosaccharides include C27 acylated and C14 alkylated derivatives, such as acetyl, methyl, ethyl and n and iso propyl derivatives. Specific examples include a methyl glucoside, 3 0 methyl glucose and 6 deoxygalactose. Preferably the monosaccharide will be glucose or galactose. The monosaccharide of choice for use in this invention is glucose e.g. dextrose . Suitable examples of actively absorbed naturally occurring amino acids include neutral amino acids such as glycine and alanine and basic amino acids such as arginine. Preferably the amino acid is glycine. Suitable electolytes for such inclusion include salts containing ions such as sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, chloride, phosphate, gluconate, sulphate, bicarbonate, carbonate and the like. Other favoured electrolytes for inclusion in the compositions include potassium dihydrogen phosphate, dipotassium hydrogen phosphate1 tripotassium phosphate, potassium chloride and the like, with potassium dihydrogen phosphate being particularly suitable. One particularly preferred electolyte for inclusion in the composition of the invention is sodium chloride. Suitably the sympathomimetic phenylethylamine derivative, is administered in solution in the oral rehydration composition. However it may also be administered separately in an orally administrable form. Suitably the compound of formula I is administered at from 100 pg kgiday to 40 mg kg day depending on the activity of the compound and the recipient species, for instance 1 to 5 mg kg day most conveniently in two equal doses. For use in the above treatments, the compound of formula I may be presented as a pharmaceutically acceptable composition. Accordingly the present invention provides an orally administrable pharmaceutical composition comprising a sympathomimetic phenylethylamine derivative having 2 adrenoceptor agonist activity, which is, preferably, a compound of formula I , and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier therefor. As used herein the term pharmaceutically acceptable includes veterinarily acceptable. In particular, the present invention provides an improved oral rehydration formulation comprising an actively absorbed monosaccharide, sodium ions and a sympathomimetic phenylthylamine derivative preferably compound of formula I as hereinbefore defined. The improved oral rehydration formulation may be presented as a dry powder for dissolution in water or a concentrate for dilution in water. Alternatively the formulation may be an orally administrable solution in water, in which case the solution contains at least 0.5 w v of the monosaccharide and at least 25 niM sodium ions and has an osmolarity of less than 500 m Osmolar.Preferably the formulation also comprises an actively absorbed amino acid and electrolyles Most preferably the formulation comprises a compound of formula I and an oral rehydration formulation as described in U.K. Patent No. 1 581 826 and U.K. PatentApplication No. 2 012 163 A, U.S. Patent No. 3 898 328 orNalin, D.R. Cash, R.A., Bull World Health Org, 43, 361, 1970 . Advantageously the improved formulation includes a preservative or antioxidant such as ascorbate anions or sodium metabisulphite. When presented in solution the formulation would preferably comprise about 6 mM ascorbate or up to 0.1 w v sodium metabisulphite. Advantageously the formulation, when presented as a dry powder, is packaged to exclude air and moisture.

Mice 7 9 day old infant mice are separated from their mothers shortly before use and are administered the compound 45 mins prior to oral challenge with 0.05 0.10 ml of culture filtrate prepared from an enteropathogenic strain of E. coli. Control animals receive drug vehicle 45 mins prior to challenge with a similar amount of culture filtrate. The compounds are administered orally. Animals are killed two hours later and the entire intestine removed. The ratio of gut weight to remaining bodyweight GW BW is determined from each animal and the increase in this ratio is determined by subtracting 0.06 GW BW for untreated mice from the GW BW of the animal. Drug treated animals are compared with untreated controls. If the compound has had an effect in inhibiting the fluid secretion caused by the enterotoxin s present in the culture filtrate then the gut weight bodyweight ratio should be reduced in the treated animals. The percentage fluid inhibition is determined from the formula Mean increase in GW BW ratio in treated animals 100 Mean increase in GW BW ratio in control animals x 100Results are given in the table below.

Calf Thiry Vella Intestinal Loop Model In vivo tests were conducted using male castrate calves, each with two surgically prepared Thiry Vella intestinal loops prepared as described by R.J. Bywater,J. Comp. Path., 80, 565, 1970 . The loops are washed with saline and then a saline bolus is left in the loops for 30 minutes to establish a basal absorptive rate. After 30 minutes the fluid in the loops is removed and measured. Heat stable E.coli enterotoxin from E. coli strain p16 is added to the loop infusate which is then returned to the loops. After a further 30 minutes the content of the loops is measured once more and at this time drug is added to the test loop perfusate. Measurements of absorpotion or secretion from the loops are made every 30 minutes over the subsequent 21 2 hours. The results are expressed in terms of fluid ml secreted into or absorbed from the loops after each 30 minute period. A minimum of six observations are undertaken with each experimental compound. Perfusion periods in which drugs are present in a loop are alternated with perfusion periods in which drug is absent from the same loop.Calf Thiry Vella Intestinal Loop ModelAl Adrenaline, 100 pgEMI19.1 tb Time SEP min SEP after SEP Secretion ml 30 SEP min tb toxin SEP administration SEP mean SEP SEP SEM SEP n 10 tb SEP a SEP Control SEP 100 SEP g kg SEP Adrenaline tb 30 0 SEP 3 SEP SEP 1 SEP 3 SEP SEP SEP SEP 1 tb SEP 0 30 SEP 27 SEP SEP 2 SEP 31 SEP SEP 3 tb SEP 30 60 SEP 18 SEP SEP 2 SEP 10 SEP SEP 1 SEP tb SEP 60 90 SEP 15 SEP SEP 2 SEP 8 SEP SEP 2 SEP SEP tb SEP 90 120 SEP 10 SEP SEP 2 SEP 6 SEP t SEP 2 tb 120 150 SEP 12 SEP SEP 2 SEP RTI ID 19.8 8 SEP SEP 3 tb 150 180 SEP 7 SEP SEP 2 SEP tb Denotes significantly different fluid secretion from control P0.05 students t test a Drug administered 30 min. after toxin A2 Adrenaline bitartrate 36 Mglkg EMI20.1 Time SEP min SEP after SEP Secretion SEP ml 30 SEP min tb toxin SEP administration SEP mean SEP SEP SEP SEM tb SEP 30 SEP g kg tb SEP a SEP Control SEP Adrenaline SEP bitartrate tb SEP 30 0 SEP 4 SEP SEP 1 SEP SEP 7 SEP SEP SEP 2 tb SEP 0 30 SEP 17 SEP SEP 2 SEP 19 SEP SEP 3 tb SEP 30 60 SEP 12 SEP SEP 2 SEP 7 SEP SEP SEP 3 tb SEP 60 90 SEP 10 SEP SEP 2 SEP 6 SEP SEP SEP 1 tb SEP 90 120 SEP 8 SEP SEP 2 SEP 8 SEP SEP 2 tb SEP 120 150 SEP 8 SEP SEP 2 SEP 9 SEP SEP SEP 3 tb SEP 150 180 SEP 8 SEP SEP 3 SEP 7 SEP SEP SEP 3 tb B Novadrenaline 1 g kgEMI20.2 tb Time SEP min SEP after SEP Secretion ml 30 SEP min tb toxin SEP administration SEP mean SEP SEP SEM tb SEP a SEP Control SEP 1 SEP g kg tb SEP Novadrenaline tb SEP 30 0 SEP 3 SEP SEP 2 SEP SEP 2 SEP RTI ID 20.16 SEP SEP 2 tb SEP 0 30 SEP 29 SEP SEP 3 SEP 30 SEP SEP SEP 4 tb SEP 30 60 SEP 19 SEP SEP 2 SEP 16 SEP SEP 2 tb SEP 60 90 SEP 16 SEP SEP 3 SEP 15 SEP SEP 2 tb SEP 90 120 SEP 15 SEP SEP 1 SEP 5 SEP SEP 4 tb SEP 120 150 SEP 8 SEP SEP 1 SEP 5 SEP SEP 3 tb SEP 150 180 SEP 8 SEP SEP 2 SEP 11 SEP SEP 3 tb a Drug administered 30 minutes after toxin 3.
