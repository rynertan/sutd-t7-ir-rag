# Head for checking dimensions of mechanical parts.

## Abstract
A measuring or contact detecting head comprises devices with feelers 70, 74, 75 fixed to a movable arms 62 64 , fulcrum means 65 67 for permitting movements of the arms 62 64 and transducer or switch means 95 for electrically detecting these movements. In order to perform, precisely and accurately, multiple contemporaneous checkings, and to render easy and quick the operations for assembling the measuring means to be used for these applications, the head substantially comprises an integral member 60 that defines, in addition to a support portion 61 , the movable arms 62 64 and the fulcrum means 65 67 and the latter 65 67 are aligned for defining a single axis of rotation for the movable arms 62 64 . There are also foreseen devices 76, 77 for adjusting the spatial position of the feelers 70, 74, 75 . In particular, this head is used in manual snap gauges for simultaneously checking a plurality of diameters.
