## Abstract
Process for the recovery of monosaccharides from poly , oligo and or disaccharides containing tuberous plants by reduc ing the roots of the tuberous plants by means of grating, extract ing the reduced material with unwarmed water, for instance of at most 18 C, subjecting the extract at first to an ultrafiltration and then to a demineralisation after which the saccharides present in the obtained solution are hydrolyzed by means of a cation exchanger H form or by acidification.
