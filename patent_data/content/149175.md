# Dispersions of antifungus agents and antifungal hair treatment compositions.

## Abstract
Stable aqueous dispersion system of antifungus agents is obtainable by dispersing 2 mercaptopyridine N oxide re ferred to Mept compounds with a specified polymer com pound, for example , polyglycol polyamine condensation resin.

## Description
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION i Field of The Invention This invention relates to aqueous dispersions of antifungus agents and antifungal hair treatment compositions in which metal salts of 2 mercaptopyridineN oxide are stably dispersed.ii Description of The Prior Art Metal salts of 2 mercaptopyridine N oxide hereinafter referred to simply as Mept compounds are known to be effective as germicides and are widely utilized not only as ordinary germicides, but also as dandruff removers being added to shampoos. The metals of the Mept compounds are calcium, magnesium, barium, strontium, zinc, cadmium, tin, zirconium and the like.Of these, zinc salts are widely used. However, these Mept compounds are sparingly soluble in water and high in specific gravity, e.g. the zinc salt hereinafter referred to simply as Zpt compound has a solubility in water of 15 ppm at 250C and specific gravity of 1.8. Accordingly, they have been commercially sold in the form of powder or aqueous dispersions. Because of the high specific gravity, theMept compounds are apt to coagulate, settle and separate even when suspended or dispersed in solvents. Commercially sold aqueous dispersions of Mept compounds have been heretofore prepared by shearing theMept compound in the presence of dispersants. However, some dispersions may settle and solidify at the bottom of a container during storage. Even with relatively stable dispersions, they may disadvantageously coagulate and separate by incorporation of salts or freezing. At present, shampoos and rinses comprisingMept compounds are put on the market. Several methods of stably adding Mept compounds to shampoo or rinse compositions are known including, for example, a method of adding highly viscous polymers such as cross linked polyacrylates Japanese Patent Publication No. 49 49117 and a method of adding acrylic acid acrylate copolymers Japanese Patent Publication No. 54 16951 . However, these methods have the drawback that limitation is placed on the type of surface active agent and the pH range used to stably disperse Mept compounds. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In view of the above, the present inventors have made intensive studies in order to overcome the drawback and, as a result, found that when specific types of polymer compounds are used to disperse Mept compounds in water, the resulting dispersion is very stable under ordinary preservation conditions and resistant to salts and, when once frozen and then melted, remains unchanged. To a surprise, it was also found that when the thus prepared aqueous dispersion of the Mept compounds was added to bases of hair treatments such as shampoos, hair rinses and hair lotions, the dispersed state of the Mept compound is stably maintained without involving any limitation as mentioned above. The present invention is accomplished based on the above findings. According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a dispersion of an antifungus agent comprising A at least one metal salt of 2 mercaptopyridine N oxide and B a polyglycol polyamine condensation resin or polyglycol polyamine alkyl or alkyleneamine condensation resin. According to another aspect of the invention, there is also provided an antifungal hair treatment composition which comprises a base for hair treatment and a dispersion of an antifungus agent comprising A at least one metal salt of 2 mercaptopyridine N oxide and B a polyglycol polyamine condensation resin or polyglycol polyamine alkyl or alkyleneamine condensation resin.
