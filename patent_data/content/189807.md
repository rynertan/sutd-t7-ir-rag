## Description
The present invention relates to a surgical system, a surgical device and a handpiece according to the first parts of claims 1,10 and 18, respectively. Operating tips for cutting and abrading tissue come in widely different sizes and configurations, each designed for performance of a particular surgical procedure. The optimum operational limits of the different surgical devices are different, e.g. as to the speed and torque at which they can safely operate. If a surgical procedure on a patient requires use of surgical devices of differing characteristics, the surgeon must either have separate motorized units for each device, or a central unit must be adjusted with each device change, a time consuming operation, and one that entails some risk of error, with possible damage to the instrument or injury to the patient. US A 4,289,131 Mueller describes a surgical power tool in which a quick lock latch mechanism permits attachment and removal of the drive shaft assembly with one hand and a seal arrangement is provided. The power unit portion has a female end which receives the male end of the drive shaft assembly. Outwardly extending pins from the male portion pass through aligned notches in a rotatable cap portion and in the female end, and are locked in place by rotation of the cap. The technical problem of the invention regarding this prior art is to provide a surgical system having different operational limits which enables greater safety, speed and convenience with a single drive unit a surgical device, adapted for use in the surgical system and a handpiece adapted for use in the surgical system. The solution to this problem is accomplished by the characterizing parts of claims 1,10 and 18, respectively. The remaining claims go further in specifying the invention. A plurality of ways of carrying out the invention is described in detail below with reference to the drawings in which Referring to Fig. 1, the arthroscopic surgical system of the invention consists of handpiece 10, surgical devices 12, 14, 16, each intended for use within specific preselected operational limits, controller power unit 18 and foot control 50. Also included are removable rotary tips selectively adapted for use with the surgical devices, as discussed more fully below. Handpiece 10 includes motor 21, and has a distal recess 22 into which drive shaft 23 extends. The recess is sized and configured to securely receive a proximal portion of the associated surgical devices. Three such surgical devices are shown. The Shaver Cutter device 12 has an axial bore 13 of diameter D₁, sized and adapted to receive rotary tips having a corresponding outer diameter for operation at rotational speeds in range R₁, e.g. from about 100 rpm up to about 3 revolutions per second or 200 rpm, at maximum torque of T₁, e.g., 28 inch ounces about 2000 cm. gms. . Rotary tips useful with this surgical device include the Shaver, Cutter and Trimmer Blade Assemblies, manufactured by Dyonics, Inc. of Andover, Massachusetts. These are indicated by reference numerals 25, 26, 27 in Fig. 1. Arthroplasty Synovial Resector device 14 has a larger axial bore 15 of diameter D₂, sized and adapted to receive rotary tips of corresponding outer diameter for operation at higher rotational speeds in range R₂, e.g. 400 to 1400 rpm, and at maximum torque of T₂, e.g. about 28 inch ounces about 2000 cm. gms. . Rotary tips useful with this surgical device include the Abrader and Full Radius Synovectomy Blade Assemblies, also manufactured by Dyonics, Inc., and are indicated by reference numerals 28 and 29 in Fig. 1. Small Joint device 16 has an axial bore 17 of diameter D₃, sized and adapted to receive rotary tips of configuration similar to those mentioned above, but of smaller size for use within joints offering limited working volume, e.g., the ankle, elbow and wrist joints. Examples of suitable rotary tips are indicated by reference numerals 30 and 31. Device 16 is suited for operation of rotary tips in rotational speed range R₃, e.g. about 300 to 1500 rpm, at maximum torque T₃, e.g. about 14 inch ounces about 1000 cm. gms. . Each rotary tip defines a vacuum passage extending from the distal end of the tip, adjacent the cutting edges, through the rotary tip, to discharge into a vacuum passage defined by the associated surgical device, which serves as a drain case. The vacuum passage of the drain case in turn is connected via outlet 39 in its side wall to an aligned port 38 in the side wall defining the recess into drain tube 40 provided within the handpiece. Adjacent the proximal end of the handpiece the drain tube terminates in connector 42 adapted for attachment to a suction hose 44, e.g. from a wall suction outlet 46, for removal of tissue and fluid from the surgical site. By conducting the fluid through the handpiece to the proximal end, where the connecting hose, as it exits, is substantially parallel to the power cord 48, interference by the suction hose with manipulation of the handpiece by the surgeon is minimized. Within the handpiece, closely adjacent surface 32 defining the surgical device receiving recess, are sensors consisting of end operated mini reed switches 34, 34 . In the proximal end surface of each of the surgical devices, at selected locations opposite the positions of the sensors when the device is assembled with the handpiece, are magnets 36, 36 adapted to actuate the reed switches. The magnet indicators in the surgical devices are arranged in predetermined respective patterns, whereby the acuation of the switches opposite the magnet positions identifies to the rest of the system, the device that is to be used. The controller power unit then automatically establishes a limit on the power to be provided to the handpiece to limit the speed range and the torque to within the preselected limits for optimum performance of the rotary tip being used. This reduces the chance of damage to the surgical device or tip, and reduces the risk of injury to the patient. The motor compartment of handpiece 10 is sealed, with the reed switches disposed within the compartment, to permit the handpiece to be sterilized by autoclaving. The surgical devices and rotary tips can also be autoclaved. Referring to Fig. 1, to operate the arthroscopic surgical system of the invention, connect footswitch 50 to the labeled receptacle on the side of the controller power unit 18. Plug the cord 48 from the motorized handpiece 10 into the proper receptacle 52 on the side of the unit. In the unit shown, provision is made for operation of motor drive units for the Dyonics, Inc. Intra Articular Surgical System and the Arthroplasty System by connecting them to receptacles 54, 56 of the power unit. The receptacles are designed so that each motor drive unit will function only if its plug is inserted into the correct receptacle. Turn the selector switch 58 at the left of the controller power unit front panel to its center position, labeled UNIVERSAL DRIVE . If another motor drive unit is to be used, turn the selector switch to the appropriate position. Power is supplied only at the selected receptacle. Select the desired surgical device, e.g. Shaver Cutter device 12, bring the handpiece 10 and device 12 together, orienting the handpiece so its key slot 60 can be seen. Orient the device 12 so its key 62 can be seen. Slide the device into the handpiece so that the key enters the slot. Push in until a click is heard. When it is desired to remove a surgical device, press down on the key and simultaneously draw the device from the handpiece. If suction is being applied, the operator will perceive a slight force holding the components together. Each surgical device has a spring loaded ring 64 at its distal end. This is the release ring that permits rotary tip insertion and removal. The reference numerals given refer to device 12. Common structural features present in devices 14 and 16 are indicated with the same reference numerals, marked prime and double prime, respectively. To attach a rotary tip, slide the release ring on the device toward the handpiece. This will reveal the key slot 66 on the distal rim of device recess device 16, Fig. 6 . Select a rotary tip from the same family as the selected device. The proximal portions of the rotary tips are selectively sized to fit properly in the bore of only the surgical device with which they are intended to be used. Orient the handpiece and device so that the key slot 66 on the device and the corresponding key on the tip can both be seen. Insert the tip into the device so that the key goes into the slot. Let the release ring slide back to its original position. To remove a tip, slide the release ring toward the handpiece, and simultaneously draw the tip out of the device. If suction is being applied, the operator will perceive a slight force holding the components together. Before beginning operation, the functions of the system should be tested. Turn the power unit function selector switch 68 at the lower right of the panel to the ON position. Turn the motor selector switch 58 at the lower left of the panel to the position corresponding to the handpiece. When the handpiece of the invention is used, one of LEDs 70 at the top of the panel will automatically identify the device being used. If no device is attached to the handpiece, no LED will light and the motor will not run. Use the speed control 72 at the center of the panel to control the speed of the rotating tip within the range allowed. Depress the footswitch and check that the blade in the tip goes in both the forward and reverse directions. Check the charge remaining in the battery by noting which LED is lighted in the bargraph 74 at the top right of the panel. If one of the bottom three LEDs is lighted, the unit should be recharged as soon as possible. The function selector switch 68 must be in the ON left position for this reading turn it to the OFF center position when not using or charging the power unit. During operation, it is normal for the LED bargraph reading to change when the footswitch is depressed. Push the suction tube 44 firmly on the drain connector 42 of handpiece drain tube 40. The following is a brief description of the system circuitry, shown in Figs. 7 through 7d. Other embodiments of the invention are within the following claims. For example, the surgical device and rotary tip may be provided as an integral unit. Where desired, the indicators may identify operational limits in addition to or those other than power. Also, the controller power unit may be integral with the handpiece.
