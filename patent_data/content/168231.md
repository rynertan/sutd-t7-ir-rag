# A COMBINATION CIRCUIT

## Abstract
A combination circuit formed of a functional portion circuit coupled to a latch or flip flop circuit portion which is fabricated as a single gate on an integrated circuit semicon ductor chip. The functional circuit portion can be a multiplex er, or other logic functions such as AND, NAND, OR, NOR, XOR, etc. A special buffer circuit is provided which generates a latch enable signal for the latch or a clock signal for the flip flop in the combination circuit. The latch enable signal or the clock signal for the combination circuit has to override the high level values of the normal second level ECL signals while their low level values can be the same as those of normal second level ECL signals. This combination circuit has the advantage of higher speed, lower power consump tion, and reduced component counts which is favorable for integrated circuits.
