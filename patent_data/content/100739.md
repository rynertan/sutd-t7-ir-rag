# SURFACE ACOUSTIC WAVE DEVICE AND METHOD OF MANUFACTURING SAID SURFACE ACOUSTIC WAVE DEVICE

## Abstract
A thin film metallic loop 30 is used to electrically short the gap 16a between metallic portions 16, 28 of a surface acoustic wave device 10 to eliminate substrate surface cracks. The loop 30 is deposited on the substrate 13 at the same time the structures 16, 28 defining the gap 16a are deposited.
