# Liquid storage and measurement system.

## Abstract
A liquid storage and measurement system particularly applicable to the volumetric measurement of liquid hydro carbon fuel and to the dispensing of the fuel via a fuel dispensing unit, includes a liquid measurement storage vessel 7 of known dimensions arranged to be partially filled with liquid, e.g. fuel, from a bulk liquid storage means to provide a liquid gas interface, means 1, 4, 5, 6 for supplying liquid to the measurement storage means 7 means, 14 for discharging liquid from the measurement storage vessel 7 , transducer means 8 for, during continuous discharge of the liquid from the measurement storage vessel 7 , continually sensing and monitoring the level of the interface during each of a plurality of predetermined time intervals such as to produce an electrical signal indicative of the position of the interface during each predetermined time interval, signal generating transducer means 9 arranged to produce an electrical signal indicative of a reference interface level during each time interval, comparison means for comparing the reference and interface signals to provide an indication of the change in position of the interface during successive time intervals and computing means 35 for relating the known dimensions of the measurement storage vessel 7 to the sensed interface level to provide a volumetric indication of the liquid being continuously discharged at any instant from the measurement storage vessel 7 .
