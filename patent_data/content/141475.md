# X ray tube comprising a helical groove bearing.

## Abstract
The bearing in an X ray tube comprising a liquid metal lubricated helical groove bearing is provided with a push pull bearing at one or both end faces of a bearing member. Consequently, the bearing member need not be further secured so that, notably in the case of suitable cooling of the anode disc and the bearing, extremely precise positioning of the radiation object point in the tube can be achieved.
