## Description
A CONTROL CIRCUIT FOR A VARIABLE DISPLACEMENT AIR CONDITIONING COMPRESSOR HACKGROl3ND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a control system for controlling the operation of an air conditioning system, and more particularly, to a control circuit for a variable displacement compressor in an automobile air conditioning system. In conventional air conditioners, thermal control in the room cncrally is accomplished by the intermittent operation of the air conditioning compressor through a magnetic clutch or motor. The magnetic clutch or motor is connected to the compressor and activated by a signal from a thermostat disposcd in the room. Once the temperature in the room has bcen lowered to a desired temperature, the refrigerating or cooling capacity of the air conditioner for supplemental cooling because of further temperature changes in the room, or for keeping the room at the desired temperature, nced not be as large.Therefore, after the room has been cooled to the desired temperature, conventional air conditioning compressors are Intermittently operated in response to the thcrmostat signal. Comprcssors having a large cooling capacity are operated even more intermittently so that the large load required to drive such compressors is intermittently applied to the compressor drive mechanism. In air conditioning systems for automobiles, the compressor usually Is driven by the engine of the automobile. Since the r.p.m. of the automobile engine changes continuously, the rotation frequency of the compressor also changes which in turn rapidly changes the cooling capacity of the air conditioner. Automobile air conditioners generally are designed so that whcn the compressor is driven by the engine at normal driving speed, the air conditioner operates at optimum capacity. Therefore, when the compressor is driven by the engine at lower operating speed, or during idling, the cooling capacity of the air conditioner is insufficient in comparison with the refrigerating or cooling load.Also, when the compressor is driven by the engine at high operating speed, the cooling capacity is higher than necessary. One known mechanism for controlling the excessive cooling capacity of an air conditioner operates by heating part of the cool air generated by the air conditioner. Part of the cool air from the evaporator of the air conditioner passes a heating unit which heats the cool air and this heated air is mixed with the remaining cool air to control the temperature of the air which is blown into the room or compartment. In this mechanism, the ratio of cooling capacity to heating capacity is controlled in response to driving frequency. This mechanism for controlling air temperature Is complicated and considerable energy is spcnt to reheat the cool air by using engine powcr. In another known embodiment, the magnetic clutch which is disposed on the compressor and connected between the engine and the compressor to transmit rotating motion is intermittentiy operated to control the operation of the compressor. However, since the magnetic clutch may be operated at high rotation frequency, a sudden force is generated at the moment the clutch is engaged and this sudden force is transmitted to the engine and the compressor. Also, the temperature of the air blown into the compartment drastically changes upon operation of the comprcssor. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is a primary object of .this invention to provide a control system for an air conditioning system, particularly an automobile air conditioncr, which controls the cooling capacity of the air conditioner in response to operating conditions to maintain the correct balance between cooling capacity and the refrigerating or cooling load at all times. In particular, it is an object of this invention to provide a control circuit for a variable displacement air conditioning compressor which automatically adjusts the capacity of the compressor in response to the cooling load. ft is another object of this invention to provide a capacity control system for an air conditioning system, particularly an automobile air coii ditioner, which reduces sudden forces acting on the engine and the com pressor. It is a further object of th3s invention to provide a capacity control system for an air conditioning system, particularly an automobile air con ditioner, which improvcs performance and cfficiency.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Referring to Figure I, the basic construction of an air conditioning system, particularly an automobile air conditioning system, is shown. This air conditioning system comprises compressor 10, condenser ii, receiver and dryer 12, a thermostatic expansion device or valve 13 and evaporator 14. These five basic components are coupled in series to form a conventional closed vapor cycle refrigeration circuit. Refrigerant gas is compressed in compressor 10 and supplied to condenser 11 where It is condensed to liquid refrigerant and cooled by forced ventilation of fan 15. The liquid refrigcrant it accumulated in receiver and drycr 12, which removes moisture and metal chips from the liquid refrigerant. The liquid refrigerant within receiver and dryer 12 is deiivered to thermostatic expansion valve 13. The refrigerant expands as it flows through valve 13 and emergcs as a two phase mixture of liquid and gas, but primarily liquid. The two phase mixture then flows through cvaporator 14.Evaporator 14 operates as a heat exchanger in conjunction with blower i6 which supplies air to the vehicle conlpartmcnt. Heat is transfcrred from te incoming air to the liquid refrigerant and the entirety of the refrigerant vaporizes and assumes its gascous state. The refrigerant gas at thc output of the evaporator then is passed to the suctionInlet of compressor 10. Compressor 10. which is shown in block diagram form in Figure 1, is 2 variable displacement compressor. In the preferred embodiment, compressor 10 is a scroll type compressor including a variable displacement device as shown in copending European patent application No. 82301205.9 filed on March 9, 1982 and copending European patent application No. 8230 702.0 filed on December 15, 1982. Compres. or 10 is controlled by operation of magnetic clutch 17, which is connected to voltage source 18 through main air conditioning switch 19 and thermostat switch 22. Thermostat switch 22 is a conventIonal thermostat which is placid in the room or compartment to be cooled to control the operation of magnetic clutch 17 in response to the temperature in the room. As mentioned above, compressor 10 includes a variable displacement device which is capable of changing the refrigerating or cooling capacity of tnc compressor The capacity of the compressor shown in Figure 1 can be changed to one or two conditions, CCI or CC2, as shown in Figure 2. InFigure 2, curve C is the normal capacity of prior art compressors.The variable displacement device of compressor 10 includes at least one valve as shown in patent applications Nos. 82301205.9 and 82306702.0 and this valve is controlled by solenoid 20 shown in Figure 1. sOlenoid 20 b connected to voltage source IS through detecting device 21 and ma3n air conditioning switch 19. Detecting device 2I Is a pressure sensitive switch which is coupled to the fluid inlet of compressor 10 to sense the suction pressure or refrigerant pressure at the fluid inlet of the compressor. This suction pressure is related to the rcfrigerant or cooling load gs illustrated in Figure 3. Referring now to Figure 3, the correlation between the refrigerating or cooling load and the pressure of the suction gas will be described. In the refrigeration circuit of the air conditioning system of Figure 1, expansion valve 13 is disposed on the inlet side of evaporator 14 to automatically control the pressure of the refrigerant. Accordingly, when the refrigerating load is large, the temperature difference between the refrigerant passing through evaporator 14 and the air in the compartment is large resulting in a greater evaporation of the liquid refrigerant in evaporator 14. As the amount of evaporation in evaporator 14 increases, the pressure of the refrigerant in evaparator 14 increascs.Also, when the compressor is driven at lower operating speeds or during idling, the amount of refrigerant discharged is reduced. However, expansion valve 13 operates to balance the refrigerating or cooling load and circulate the proper amount of rcfrigerarit so that the refrigerant is supplied at high pressure. As mentioned zbovc, when the refrigerating or cooling load is large, or the compressor is driven at lower operating speed or during idling, thc evaporating pressure of refrigerant in evaporator 14 increases so that the suction pressure at thc inlet of compressor 10 increases. Furthermore, when the refrigerating or ccoling load is lower, or compressor 10 is driven at high operation speed1 the suction pressure is lower. Thus, the refrigerating or cooling load of thc air conditioning system is related to the suction pressure as shown in Figure 3. Rzferrìng to Figures 1 and 4, the operation of the present invention will he described. Figure 4 shows the suction pressure as a function of time for three different refrigerating or cooling load conditions. Detecting device 21 iS responsive to a first predetermined pressure level l x of the suction gas or refrigerant at the fluid inlet of compressor 10 to actuate magnetic coil 20, which operates the variable displacement device to change the displacement of compressor IO from large volume CCI to small volumeCC2. Detecting device 21 also is responsive to a second predetermined pressure level P52 to change the displacement of compressor IO from small volume CC2 to large volume CCI. The solid line curve I in Figure 4 shows the suction pressure as a function of time when the refrigerating or cooling capacity exceeds the refrigerant or cooling load. In this case, compressor 10 initially operates at a large volume CCI and then, when the pressure of the suction gas drops below predetermined pressure level Ps1, pressure sensitive switch 21 iS closed. Solenoid 20 of the variable displacement device then is energiztd so that the displacement of the compressor 10 is changed from large volume CC1 to small volume CC2.Compressor 10 continues to operate at small volume CC2 because the refrigerating capacity exceeds the cooling load and the pressure cf the suction gas cannot cxceed predetermined pressure levelPs1. The dotted line of curve I shows the suction pressure as a function of time for a compressor which is not provided with a variable displacement device. By comparing the dotted line curve I with the solid line curve I, it is apparent that the present invention maintains the suction pressure at a higher level than prior art compressors. Thus, the performance of the compressor of the present invention is improved, while the required driving force for the compressor is reduced. Curve I I in Figure shows the suction pressure when the refrigerating or cooling load is balanced by a cooling capacity of small volume CC lii this case, upon initial operation of the ait corditioning system, the compressor operates with large volume CCI, and when the suction pressure decreases below predetermined pressure PsI, the displacement of the com prcssor is changed from large volume CC1 to small volume CC2. After changing the displacement of the compressor, the suction pressure icreascs above the predetermincd pressure P5j. However, the suction pressure does not exceed the predctermined pressure Ps2 because the refrigerating capacity of small volume CC2 and the cooling load are balanced. Thus, compressor 10 continues to operate at small volume CC2. Curve III in Figure 4 shows the suction pressure when the refrigerating or cooling load is large than the small volume cooling capacity CC2, but smaller than the large volume cooling capacity CCI. In this case, when thc suction pressure gocs below predetermined pressure Psl during operation at large volume CC1, the displacement of compressor 10 is changed from large volume CC1 to small volume CC,. After changing the displacement, the suction pressure increases until the predetermined pressure Ps2 is reached.Then, pressure switch 2I opens so that the variable displacement device operates to change the displacement from small volume CC to large volume CCI. The above cycle repeats itself so that the displacement of the compressor continues to change. Furthermore, if during subsequent operation, the suction pressure does not reach thc predetermined pressure level Psl, the displacement of compressor 10 is no longcr changed. Referring now to Figure 5, another embodiment of the present invention is shown. This embodiment is directed to a modification of the capacity control circuit of Figure 1 to improve the operation of the variable displacement device. Detecting device 21 of Figure 5 comprises a temperature switch which detects the temperature of the suction gas or re rigcrant at the fluid inlet of compressor 10. This temperature switch closes at a prc dctermined temperature level to actuate the variable displacement device via solenoid 20 to change the displacement volume of compressor Io. This temperature switch replaces the pressure scnsitive swith of Figure 1 RTI ID 7.24 because when the engine of an automobile accelerates, or when the engine is quickly brought to an idling condition, the suction pressure is suddenly reduced without reflation to the cooling load. In this condition, the variable displacement device would operate intermittently in rcsporlse to pressure changes, but the temperature of the suction gas does not undergo such drastic changes. Thus, in Figure 5, the variable displacement device is operated by the capacity control circuit in response to temperaturc changes in the suction gas. Referring to Figure 6, s further embodiment is shown. In this cmbodiment, the detecting device includes both pressure sensitive switch zJb and temperature switch 2I . Prcssure sensitive switch 21b and temperature switch 2I3 are connected in series with voltage source IS and solenoid 20 to activate solenoid 20 upon the closing of both switch 21a and zIb.Thus, in this embodiment, the operation of the variable displacement device to change the capacity of compressor 10 is dependent on both the pressure and temperature of the suction gas at the fluid inlet of the compressor, As mentioned above, the air conditioning system of this invention includes a compressor which is provided with a variable displacement device to control the displacement thereof. A capacity control circuit controls the operation of the variable displacement device so that the refrigerating or cooling capacity of the compressor and the cooling load usually are balanced to reduce engine load. Thus, the desired temperature in the compartmcnt can be rapidly and easily obtained without intermittent operation of the compressor. This invention has been described in detail in connection with the pteferred embodiments, but these are cxamples only and this invention is not restricted thereto. It will be easily understood by those skilled in the art that other variations and modifications can be easily made within the scope of this inventjori.
