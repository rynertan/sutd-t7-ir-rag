A few compounds have been reported in the literature with structures and biological activities similar to Compound I Endo, in U.S. Patents 3,983,140 described fermentative production of the compound that has become known as ML 236B and compactin Monaghan et al. in U.S. Patent 4,231,938 and Albers Schonberg et al. in U.S. Patent 4,294,846 described the fermentative production, with another organism, of mevinolin and 4a, 5, dihydromevinolin respectively and the published Japanese application Kokai 55009 024 describes a tetrahydro compactin wherein the polyhydronaphthyl moiety becomes a decalin. Now with the present invention there is provided a new compound of formula I derived from mevinolin, having a trans decalin moiety in place of the hexahydronaphthyl group and an 8 S 2,2 dimethylbutyryloxy group instead of the natural 8 S 2 S methylbutyryl group. There are also provided processes for the preparation of the novel compound of this invention.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The novel compound of this invention is the compound of structural formula I or Ia EMI3.1 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of Ia such as the sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, ammonium salt or the like, or an alkyl ester such as the methyl, ethyl, or a monoglyceride. The processes of this invention are depicted by the following synthetic Schemes I and II. Synthetic Scheme IEMI4.1 Synthetic Scheme IIEMI5.1 The Synthetic Schemes I and II illustrate 3 different routes from the identical starting material to arrive at intermediate compound V, following which there are 2 steps to the novel compound I of this invention. The processes of these steps comprise the following Step 1 The compound MK 803 mevinolin or the 4a, 5 dihydro derivative thereof is treated with an excess of lithium hydroxide in aqueous solution at 50 100 reflux temperature for 2 to about 4 days, cooled, acidified, extracted with a solvent and heated in toluene solution to effect lactonization.Step 2 The diol III or VII is mono silylated by treatment wit tert butyldimethylsilyl chloride and imidazole in an aprotic solvent such as DMF at or about ambient temperature for 12 to about 24 hours to provide the 4 silyl ether.Step 3 The double bonds of the polyhydronaphthyl moiety are reduced with hydrogen and a precious metal catalyst such as platinum oxide in an organic solvent such as ethyl acetate under a pressure of 1 to 100 atmospheres at ambient temperature for about 10 to about 20 hours. After isolation of the resulting decalin the product is chromatographed, preferably on silica gel from which only the trans decalin V is isolated.Step 4 The 8 hydroxyl group of V is esterified by treatment with 2,2 dimethylbutyryl chloride in pyridine with or without an acylation catalyst such as 4 pyrrolidinopyridine, 4 dimethylaminopyridine, or 4 hydroxybenztriazole at about 100 to about 1400 for 4 to about 10 hours.Step 5 The 4 O silyl group is removed by treatment of compound VI with about 4 equivalents of glacial acetic acid and about 3 equivalents of tetrabutylammonium fluoride trihydrate in an ethereal solvent such as THF, ether, 1,2 dimethoxyethane or the like in an inert atmosphere at about 150 to about 300 for 1 to 3 days. The compound of this invention is useful as an antihypercholesterolemic agent for the treatment of atherosclerosis, hyperlipemia and like diseases.It may be administered orally or parenterally in the form of a capsule, a tablet, an injectable preparation or the like. It is usually desirable to use the oral route. Doses may be varied, depending on the age, severity, body weight and other conditions of the patients but daily dosage for adult humans is within a range of from about 2 mg to 2000 mg preferably 10 to 100 mg given in three or four divided doses. Higher doses may be favorably applied as required. The compound of this invention also has useful anti fungal activities. For example, it may be used to control strains of Penicillium sp.,Aspergillus niger, Cladosporium sp., Cochliobolus miyabeanus and Helminthosporium cynodnotis. For those utilities it is admixed with suitable formulating agents, powders, emulsifying agents or solvents such as aqueous ethanol and sprayed or dusted on the plants to be protected.
