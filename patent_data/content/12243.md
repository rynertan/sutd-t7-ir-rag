# Display system including electrostatically deflectable elements.

## Abstract
A display system includes a plurality of deflectable ele ments 18 which can be selectively deflected by the applica tion of a suitable voltage difference between each element and a support structure 11 . The support structure is formed from a semi conductor material. The deflectable elements and all the associated control devices 7 are also formed from semi conductor material. The deflectable elements and the control devices may all be formed from the basic semi conductor material of the support structure by deposition and etching techniques.
