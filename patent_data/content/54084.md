# Process for the manufacture of reinforced products of synthetic material.

## Abstract
The invention concerns a process for the production of reinforced synthetic material in which air present in the, preferably fibrous, reinforcement is replaced by a different medium. The pressure and temperature in the air replace ment step are such that the vapor pressure of the medium is at least equal to the ambient pressure, and upon or after introduction of the synthetic material the pressure and temperature are set such that the ambient pressure exceeds the vapor pressure of the medium and the medium is in the liquid state. The invention is suitable in a variety of techniques involving thermosetting as well as thermoplastic resins, and permits the production of articles of a high quality.

## Description
PROCESS FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF REINFORCED PRODUCTS OF SYNTHETIC MATERIAL The invention relates to the manufacture of reinforced products of synthetic material, the air which is present in the, preferably fibrous, reinforcement in the form of enclosures being expelled before the impregnation of the reinforcement with a synthetic material by means of the vapour of a medium, such as described in German Patent Specification 560,324. In this known process the corresponding vapour pressure of the vapour is lower than the ambiant pressure, in this case the atmospheric pressure. For this reason the medium it not able to expel the air completely. To an air gas mixture it applies that the pressure fraction of the gas equals the corresponding volume fraction of the gas. In the formula EMI1.1 In this formula Pg gas pressureP1 air pressureVg gas volumeV1 air volume Moreover, it applies to a gas mixture Ptotal pressure Po pg P1. It follows that only for Pg PO a volume fraction of the gas of 100 can exist. If, however, the gas pressure Pg PO, then the volume fraction is Pg PO at the most. Thus, the enclosed air can only be completely expelled and replaced if the vapour pressure of the, gaseous, medium is equal to or exceeds the ambient pressure. This means that in the known process air gas mixture enclosures are present, which are as harmful to the finished product as pure air enclosures. It is the purpose of the present invention to overcome this drawback and to provide a process, by means of which the complete expelling of air enclosures is guaranteed under all circumstances. This is obtained in that the pressure and the temperature are set during the stage of the expelling or replacement of the air enclosures in such way, that the vapour pressure of the medium concerned is equal to or greater than the ambiant pressure and the medium is therefore in the gaseous aggregation state, the pressure and the temperature being set during and or after the impregnation in such a way, that the vapour pressure of the medium concerned is exceeded and the medium is in the liquid aggregation state. Thus all air enclosures are replaced by gas enclosures, which during or after the impregnation, followed by the increase of the pressure and or decrease of the temperature, pass into liquid enclosures of a negligible volume, which have no harmful influence on the finished product. The medium in its gaseous aggregation state may be supplied to the fibre reinforcement from the outside e.g. injection in a die or a fabric . This is the so called external medium supply. If the density of the fibre reinforcement is high, in which case the flow resistance is high and variable, it appears that the gas chooses the way of the least resistance, so that at several places no replacement of the air enclosures occures. Then it is to be preferred that the medium in its gaseous aggregation state is supplied by evaporation from the fibre reinforcement, for which purpose the fibre reinforcement must be moistened with the medium concerned in advance. This previous moistening of the fibre reinforcement can take place in several ways, e.g. by condensation, immersion, etc. The raw material for the fibre reinforcement is preferably a fibre with a diameter of 5 to 100 um, and a length of some millimetres to endless fibres. Longer fibres can be united into bundles, so called strands. Such strands can be used in several ways as reinforcement material, e.g. single or with a number of strands combined into thicker bundles, the so called rovings. The strands or rovings may also be cut into short pieces and combined into mats, or be woven into a fabric structure. These types of fibre reinforcements can be impregnated with the synthetic material in several ways, e.g. by applying it manually, by vacuum die casting, by winding, etc. The synthetic material may be thermoplastic as well as thermosetting. In general the air enclosures present in a fibre reinforcement can be divided into a microscopic air enclosures between the elementary fibres of the strands or rovings, and b macroscopic air enclosures between the strands and or the fabric layers. These macroscopic air enclosures also include air accumula tions in dead corners of a die if a die, in which the impregnation takes place, is used for giving directly a certain final shape to be impregnated fabric reinforcement. The choice of the medium to be used depends on several criteria, such as the manufacturing process to be used, the working pressures and temperatures and the materials to be used. In the choice of the medium the following conditions must be met as such as possible suitable vapour pressure course, lower melting point than the synthetic material, having no adverse efect on the synthetic material or the reinforcement and if possible being soluble in the liquid synthetic material, presenting no risk or a negligeable risk regarding flammability and toxidity, if adequate measures are taken, not corrosive, inexpensive. Suitable media comprise among others aliphatic or cycloaliphatic hydrocarbons such as i.a. pentane or heptane, alcohols such as i.a. ethanol, ketones such as i.a. acetone and methylethylketone, esters of carboxylic acids such as i.a. ethylacetate, butylacetate, methylpropionate, nitriles such as acetonitrile, halogenated or perhalogenated hydrocarbons such as i.a. trichloroethane, bromofluoroethane and tetrachloropropane.One may also use unsaturated monomeric compounds such as i.a. styrene, methylacrylate, ethylacrylate, butylacrylate or methylmethacrylate. Such compounds are particularly useful for the preimpregnation of reinforcing material in connection with the production of articles based on unsaturated polyester.One can even use water as the medium, in those cases where minute amounts of water dispersed in the finished article are not harmful. The process according the the invention can be used in connection with a wide variety of synthetic polymeric materials such as unsa turated polyesters, epoxy resins, phenol formaldehyde resins, diallylphtalate resins, and thermoplastic resins such as i.a. polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, polyester and polyamide.The invention can be used in connection with a variety of techniques, such as i.a. die casting and vacuum die casting, winding of fiber material impregnated with thermosetting material, production of sheetmaterial by curing sheets of woven or non woven fibers, impregnated with thermosetting material, and production of thermoformable sheets by calendering a sheet of woven or non woven fibers with a thermoplastic resin. The process according to the invention can also be used to avoid air entrapment in the production of articles containing a particulate non fibrous reinforcing material. The following examples will illustrate the invention.Example IVacuum die casting method This process is used when top quality products are desired with a high fibre content and very small dimension tolerances. In this case unsaturated polyester is used as a synthetic material, glass fibre as a reinforcement and acetone as a replacement medium. The reinforcement is first soaked in acetone and then enclosed in a die. One side of the die is connected to a polyester holder, and the other side to an underpressure source, e.g. a vacuum pump. Then the valve in the polyester supply line is closed.Subsequently the pressure in the die is reduced through the underpressure source until the vapour tension of acetone. This causes the acetone to boil and evaporate from the reinforcement, the medium supplied being evacuated through the underpressure connection. As the temperature of the liquid acetone in the reinforcement drops further and further because of the continuous withdrawal of evaporation heat therefrom, also the corresponding vapour tension becomes lower and lower, as this is dependent solely on the temperature. Therefore the die pressure must be lower and lower. To avoid this and to obtain a fast evaporation, heating of the die is recommended. If all acetone has evaporated from the reinforcement, the air has been replaced almost completely by gaseous acetone. Then the underpressure connection is closed and the polyester is cast by opening the supply line. when the reinforcement has been impregnated, there are still gaseous acetone enclosures. when the pressure in the die is then increased to the atmospheric value, these gaseous enclosures will pass into liquid enclosures. These very small liquid enclosures will dissolve completely in the liquid polyester and thus have no harmful influence on the finished product.Example IIDie casting method This process is used for the manufacture of large to medium large, curved or flat plate constructions with a low fibre content, such as caravan panels, boats, loading throughs, cabins, etc. Use is made of only a small underpressure, namely 93 99 kPa absolute. The problem om this process is to avoid large to very large air enclosured, which may occur as the result of the so called dead corners in the die. This may cause the percentage of rejections to rise to 30 . In this example use is made of unsaturated polyester as a synthetic material, of a glass fibre mat as a reinforcement and of ethanol as a replacement medium. As the fibre content is low, use is made of an external medium supply with the advantage of a short replacement time. The process is as follows. First the voluminous mat reinforcement is enclosed in the die. Then the die is heated to some degrees above the boiling temperature of ethanol at atmospheric pressure, namely 78 C. Subsequently warm ethanol vapour of 78 0C is led through the reinforcement through the external medium supply, until almost all air has been replaced by the vapour. Then polyester of 78 0C is supplied.Thereafter the die is cooled, so that the ethanol vapour enclosures pass into liquid enclosures, which dissolve in the polyester. In this condition the product can harden. Again the dissolved ethanol has no harmful influence on the finished product. The advantage of this process is that the air is replaced at a small overpressure, so that no sealing problems occur. This means that no high requirements have to be set to the sealing of the die, which may therefore be simple. Example IIIMechanical impregnation of a cloth reinforcement This process is used for the manufacture of plate material, consisting of one or more layers of impregnated glass fibre cloth. In this example use is made of unsaturated polyester as synthetic material, glass fibre as reinforcement and ethanol as replacement medium. As the glass fibre content is high, use is made of internal medium supply through evaporation from the reinforcement. For reasons of clarity, first the outlines of this plate manufacturing process will be explained. The raw material is glass fibre cloth. This cloth is soaked with synthetic material by means of an impregnating mechanism, whereafter the intermediate product obtained in this way is placed on a conveyor belt, on which it may harden or solidify. The belt speed equals the output speed of the mechanism. Finally the hardened or solidified material is cut to the desired lengths. The impregnating mechanism has a dual function, namely the air replactement and the impregnation proper. The air replacement takes place in a long, slot shaped space, in which the ethanol, which has been supplied previously by means of sprayers, is evaporated by means of radiant heat. In this way the gaseous ethanol replaces the air in the air enclosures. The impregnation takes place through a pair of heated rollers, to which two supply devices continuously supply the right amount of polyester. The polyester has a temperature which equals the boiling temperature of ethanol at atmospheric pressure. Thus condensation of ethanol on the polyester is avoided. During the impregnation ethanol vapour enclosures are created, which, however, pass into liquid enclosures when the polyester cools during the hardening and which can dissolve completely in the synthetic material. The finished product is again free from air. The advantages of this process are the much higher production speeds that can be used, a quality that can be reproduced accurately, and the possibility of impregnating a number of fabric layers simultaneously, so that a multilayer plate can be manufactured in one single run.
