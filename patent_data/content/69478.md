# METAL INSULATOR SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICES

## Abstract
A metal insulator semiconductor device comprises a semiconductor substrate 1, 15 having input and output terminals 2, 3, 79, 16, 17, 23, 24 with at least one gate 8, 20, 22 arranged on an insulating layer between the two terminals. In this invention the insulator under the gate is formed as a double layer 4, 5 the first layer 4, 18 next to the substrate, is thin e.g. less than 250Å whilst the second layer 5, 19 is thicker e.g. more than 350Å thick. One layer is accumulating whilst the other is depleting. The amount of band bending at the substrate insulator interface is control led by the thickness of the first layer 4, 18 . Substrate materials include CD
