## Description
This invention relates to the use of a micellular particle composition encapsulating a chemotherapeutic agent for targeting to tumors. More particularly, the invention relates to the use of neutral or charged phospholipid micellular particle compositions containing a chemotherapeutic agent for treating tumors in a body. Before various abnormalities such as tumors in a patient s body can be diagnosed and treated, it is often necessary to locate the abnormalities. This is particularly true of such abnormalities as malignant tumors since the treatment of such tumors is often on a localized basis. For example, the location of malignant tumor cells has to be identified so that a chemotherapeutic agent can be directed to such cells to eliminate the tumor. Numerous attempts have been made over many years to identify specific locations, such as tumor locations, in a patient s body by simple techniques. For example, it would be desirable for diagnostic purposes to identify the location of cancer cells in a patient s body by a simple method involving the introduction of selected mobile particles to the patient s body and by the movement of such particles to the cancer cells. It would also be desirable to treat such cancer cells by introducing chemotherapeutic agents into the patient s body and having such agents move to such specific locations to combat the cancer cells at such locations. Except for recent advances in the use of monoclonal antibodies, simple and reliable methods for targeting specific locations such as tumors for diagnosis, and methods for successfully delivering chemotherapeutic agents to the tumors in a patient s body for treatment, have not been developed. Placing a chemotherapeutic drug in the body orally, subcutaneously or intravenously can result in harm to the normal cells in the body which take up the drug and a worsening in the patient s condition, without achieving the desired reduction in tumor cell activity. In the past, this toxicity to normal cells in the patient s body has been a major disadvantage in the treatment of tumors with chemotherapeutic agents. The lack of efficacy of such chemotherapy is also attributable to the failure of the freely circulating drug to localize within tumor cells before it is excreted or taken up by other cells in the body. Prior attempts to improve treatment of tumors by chemotherapeutic agents have included encapsulation of such agents within biodegradable phospholipid micellular particles in the form of vesicles or liposomes. Encapsulation is thought to reduce the potential toxicity from the circulating drugs. Researchers have also sought to utilize such encapsulation to selectively target tumors within a body for delivery of chemotherapeutics. However, until the present invention efforts to reliably place imaging agents or drug encapsulating particles within tumor cells have not been demonstrated. Because solid tumors and their metastases are located in extravascular tissues, to accomplish targeting of intravenously injected imaging or chemotherapeutic agents to the tumor cells, the agents must leave the normal circulation by crossing blood vessel membranes to enter the extra vascular tissues. This movement is known as extravasation . Normally, small substances such as small molecular weight proteins and membrane soluble molecules can cross tumor capillary walls by a process known as passive diffusion. However, passive diffusion was thought not to allow sufficient accumulation of larger particles carrying drugs to reach therapeutic levels within the vicinity of the tumor. H.I. Peterson, Progress in targeting specific locations, such as tumor locations, with chemotherapeutic drugs encapsulated in particles such as vesicles has been hampered by the inability to achieve movement of encapsulated drug across blood vessel membranes and to detect such movement. In the usual case, large structures such as drug encapsulating vesicles cannot escape from blood vessels such as capillaries, and thus remain in the circulation. However, an examination of the structure of the vascular morphology of a tumor reveals that the various blood vessels associated with tumors, in particular capillaries, exhibit alterations in their structure as a result of tumor cell growth patterns. Studies of tumor capillary permeability suggest that these morphologic variations in the capillaries allow some substances to cross the capillary membrane. Such variations include defects in the vascular endothelium from poor cell differentiation, and breaks in vascular walls as a result of invading tumor cells. Examples of tumor modified capillaries include vessels with interrupted endothelial lining and vessels with fenestrated endothelium. H.I. Peterson, Notwithstanding such knowledge of tumor vascular morphology, researchers such as Peterson have concluded that transport of large molecules or materials across the tumor capillary wall occurs as a result of passive diffusion only and that concentrations of active drugs sufficient for therapeutic effect are difficult to reach. H.I. Peterson, Prior to such morphologic studies, early research on the problem of extravasation suggested that vesicles might undergo transcapillary passage across the capillary membranes and on into tumor cells. G. Gregoriadis, The publication by M.R. Mauk et al in Science, Vol. 207 1980 p. 309 311, relates to subcutaneous injections of vesicles in mice and deals with the time release and specificity for leukocytes. This article does not refer to the intravenous administration of vesicles, and consequently does not relate to circulation of such vesicles in the bloodstream to tumor sites and their accumulation within tumor cells. EP 28 917 describes vesicles accumulating within the lymphatic system or the lung, spleen or liver. This document does not deal with the targeting of tumor sites for a successfull treatment of the tumor. Chemical Abstracts, Vol. 99, No. 9, August 1983, p. 306 307, Abstract No. 43393s by Machy et al describes drug transfer into target cells in vitro. Thus, this abstract does not describe injecting liposomes into the bloodstream and circulating intact to accumulate within tumor cells. Thus, although the prior art has recognized the necessity that vesicles carrying therapeutic drugs must cross vascular barriers to reach tumor cells, the experience of the art has taught that intravenous administration of micellular particles such as phospholipid vesicles is not effective to deliver encapsulated drugs to extravascular tumor cells. The object of the invention is to enhance extravasation of encapsulated therapeutic agents to tumor cells within the body to deliver said chemotherapeutic agents to the cells of such tumors. Above object is solved according to the invention by the use of a micellular particle composition, said particles having a chemotherapeutic agent encapsulated therein and comprising a chemically pure 98 pure phospholipid and zero to fifty percent cholesterol by weight of phospholipid, said particles having a size less than 200 nm, for the preparation of an intravenously administrable pharmaceutical composition useful for the delivery of said particle composition and chemotherapeutic agent into tumor cells. The micellular particle compositions to be used according to the invention comprise biodegradable micellular particles in the form of unilamellar phospholipid vesicles. Pure more than approximately 98 pure neutral phospholipid molecules containing hydrocarbon chains having at least 18 carbon atoms, such as distearoylphosphatidylcholine DSPC , are incorporated into the vesicles. The chemotherapeutic agent may be associated with the phospholipid molecules or internal contents of the particles to treat the tumors. A particularly useful chemotherapeutic agent is methotrexate. When the phospholipid vesicles as described herein are introduced into the bloodstream of a patient, they move intact to locate in specific locations in the patient s body, such as locations where cancerous growth appears. This cancerous growth at specific locations can then be treated. To enhance the movement of the phospholipid vesicles containing imaging agents or chemotherapeutic agents vesicles to the tumors in the patient s body, a first group of phospholipid vesicles having positively charged molecules extending externally from the particles may be introduced into the patient s bloodstream to block uptake by phagocytic cells such as those in the liver, spleen and other tissues in the patient s body comprising the reticuloendothelial system. The extended, positively charged molecules bound to such phospholipid vesicles may be lipid soluble molecules containing a protruding amino group, for example, aminosaccharide derivatives of cholesterol, such as 6 aminomannose derivative of cholesterol. Concurrently, or after a suitable period of time, such as approximately one hour, a second group of small less than 200nm phospholipid vesicles may be introduced into the patient s bloodstream to place intact this second group of vesicles in the specific locations such as tumors in the patient s body. Such phospholipid vesicles preferably are neutral, and may include cholesterol. Figure 1 is a table illustrating the targeting of phospholipid vesicles to tumors in a body.

As used herein, micellular particles and micelles refer to water soluble particles which result from spontaneous aggregations of amphiphilic molecules. Amphiphilic molecules contain hydrophobic and hydrophilic portions. In this invention, preferred amphiphiles are biological lipids. Such micelles can be in the form of small spheres, ellipsoids or long cylinders, and can also consist of bilayers with two parallel layers of amphiphilic molecules. Such bilayered micelles usually take the shape of unilamellar spherical vesicles with an internal aqueous compartment, and are also known as liposomes. Methods for forming these vesicles are, by now, well known in the art. Typically, they are prepared from phospholipids, for example, distearoylphosphatidylcholine by sonication, and may include other materials such as neutral lipids, for example, cholesterol, and also surface modifiers such as positively or negatively charged compounds, saccharides, antibodies and other functional ligands which have groups that can anchor the molecule in the bilayer of the vesicle. We have found that by incorporating certain phospholipid molecules, a vesicle is obtained which is stable in The stability of the phospholipid micellular particles may be further enhanced by incorporating cholesterol. A stable vesicle may be obtained by incorporating 0 50 cholesterol by weight of phospholipid into the vesicles. Small unilamellar vesicles SUV with the ionophore A23187 were prepared from distearoylphosphatidylcholine DSPC , cholesterol Ch , dicetyl phosphate DP , stearylamine SA and the 6 aminomannose AM , and 6 aminomannitol AML derivatives of cholesterol, according to previous methods. Mauk and Gamble, Briefly, chloroform solutions of 10 mg lipid with the following molar ratios DSPC Ch, 2 1 DSPC Ch X, 4 1 1 where X SA, DP or AML and DSPC Ch AM, 8 3 1, were evaporated to dryness under nitrogen N₂ and further dried under vacuum overnight. Each tube was filled with 0.6 ml phosphate 10 mM phosphate buffered 0.9 saline, pH 7.4 PBS , containing 1mM nitrilotriacetic acid NTA and sonicated under N₂, for 5 to 15 minutes with an MSE brand probe sonicator equipped with a titanium microtip. Sonication yielded the small, unilamellar vesicles or vesicles used throughout these experiments. Vesicles were annealed at 60 C for 10 minutes and centrifuged at 300 x g. Vesicles were separated from unencapsulated NTA with a 30 x 1.5 cm Sephadex G 50 column. Vesicle size was determined by electron microscopy of preparations. negatively stained with uranyl acetate. All vesicle types were shown by electron microscopy to have a mean diameter The vesicles obtained as described above are chemically pure. By chemically pure is meant that the materials which constitute phospholipid vesicles are more than 98 pure. For example, when the phospholipid chemical added is distearoyl phosphatidylcholine, this material is used at more than 98 purity. The same constraint holds for other components, such as cholesterol, which compose the vesicle. The phospholipid vesicles obtained as described above are stable when injected into experimental animals. The saccharide portions of aminomannose and aminomannitol derivatives of cholesterol extend externally from the phospholipid vesicles. Thus, when such derivatives are incorporated or associated into the bilayer of vesicles or other micelles, an amine moiety is provided that extends approximately 0.5 2.5nm preferably about 1nm, beyond the surface of the micelles. In the case of vesicles, it appears that the appropriate molecular design comprises a hydrophobic portion which serves to anchor the molecule within the vesicular bilayer, and a linking portion which is at least mildly hydrophilic which spans the requisite distance between the hydrophobic region and the amino functional group. The hydrophilicity is apparently required to prevent the link from internalizing within the bilayer also and thus serves to extend the amine from the surface. An example of a suitable extended amine within the context of this invention is a 6 aminomannose cholesterol derivative such as, for example, 6 5 cholesten 3 β yloxy hexyl 6 amino 6 deoxyl thio D mannopyranoside. In this example, the cholesterol portion provides the hydrophobic moiety, while the aminomannose is relatively hydrophilic. Other embodiments are also possible other amino sugars attached to other cholesterol derivatives, for example, are equally suitable as alternative embodiments of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic portions. Polyamines and polyamino acids which can be bound covalently or associated by other means to the vesicle or other micelle surface may also be used. These materials and cholesterol tend to impart stability to the phospholipid vesicles. Cholesterol may also be included in the range of approximately 0 to 50 of cholesterol by weight of total phospholipid, the remainder constituting the phospholipids. The chemically pure vesicle compositions discussed above are quite stable to leakage Loading of In 111 into preformed vesicles was facilitated by the presence of the ionophore A23187 in the lipid bilayer. In 111 was loaded into vesicles at 60 80 C as described by Mauk and Gamble, Male BALB c mice weighing 20 25 g were injected subcutaneously on the right hind leg with 5 x 10⁵ EMT6 cells in 0.1 ml sterile phosphate buffered saline. Tumors were allowed to grow for 10 20 days prior to using these animals for imaging studies. At this stage, tumors weighed between 0.2 and 0.4 g. Up to 0.5 ml of PBS containing 1 2 mg vesicles loaded with up to 30 µCi In 111 were injected into the tail vein of each animal. Control animals were injected with In 111 NTA which had not been encapsulated in vesicles. At one 1 hour and at twenty four 24 hours after injecting In 111 loaded vesicles, each animal was anesthetized with 40 mg kg sodium pentobarbital and positioned on a platform 12 cm from the gamma scintillation camera equipment with a 6 mm pinhold. Whole body dorsal images were acquired on x ray film and corresponding digitized data were stored on magnetic discs for computer analysis. At twenty four 24 hours, animals were sacrificed and dissected to determine the organ distribution of radioactivity. Organs or tissues were excised, washed in PBS, blotted dry and weighed. Radioactivity was measured in a well type gamma ray spectrometer and quantitated based on activity present in vesicles before injection. In some experiments, the gamma ray perturbed angular correlation PAC spectroscopy technique was used to measure the rotational correlation time of the In 111 in individual tissues and thereby assess the proportion of isotope remaining in intact vesicles. Mauk and Gamble, For autoradiography small, neutral, unilamellar vesicles were prepared with a composition similar to that described above for the In 111 labeling, except that H 3 dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine H 3 DPPC was added as a marker and to produce autoradiographic exposure. For autoradiographic studies, EMT6 tumor fragments 25 50 mg were implanted subcutaneously in female BALB C mice 5 to 12 days prior to the experiment. EMT6 tumor bearing mice were then given intravenous injections of 225 350 µCi of H 3 labeled vesicles, or normal saline as a background control. Fifteen hours later, the animals were sacrificed. Tumor, heart, skeletal muscle, liver, spleen and skin samples were removed, immediately immersed in the solution of 2 glutaraldehyde 2 paraformaldehyde, and sectioned into 1 2 mm pieces. The samples were further fixed in 1 osmium tetroxide, and then dehydrated and embedded in EPON for thin sectioning. Thin 1.5 µm tissue sections were placed on microscope slides and coated with Ilford L4 photographic emulsion. Emulsions were exposed for 14 21 days and then developed. Tissues were lightly counterstained with 1 toluidine blue, and photomicrographs were taken. Whole body scintographs were made of tumor bearing mice which had been injected intravenously with small In 111 NTA phospholipid vesicles 24 hours previously. EMT6 tumor images were clearly discernible in animals injected with neutral, negative and positively charged phospholipid vesicles. The quality of tumor imaging is enhanced significantly using a vesicle blockade. In particular, neutral DSPC Ch phospholipid vesicles deliver In 111 to EMT6 murine tumors in sufficient quantity to allow definitive localization of tumors by gamma camera imaging. A comparison of the biodistribution of In 111 NTA delivery by each of these vesicle types can be made from the data presented in Figure 1. As will be seen from the second column of Figure 1, neutral phospholipid vesicles provided the best delivery of In 111 to tumor tissue. The specific targeting of the phospholipid vesicles to the tumors in this instance was at least as high as the targeting of the phospholipid vesicles to the liver or spleen, the usual target tissues of vesicles, and was nearly 8 times greater than the specific activity observed at the tumors when free In 111 NTA was injected Applicants have previously demonstrated a strong association with EMT6 tumor cells Vesicles with a lower concentration of the 6 AM derivative of cholesterol do not get trapped in the lung, so it seemed reasonable to assume that AM 2 vesicles third column of Figure 2 loaded with In 111 might be better tumor imaging agents than the material shown in the second column of Figure 2. A comparison of the second and third columns of Figure 2 shows that this was not the case. In fact, the AM 2 vesicles had a very high affinity for the liver and spleen. For example, after a period of 24 hours from the time of the injection of the lipid vesicles in the blood stream, the combined radioactivity in the liver and spleen averaged greater than 75 of the total injected dose. This was the highest amount of liver and spleen uptake of vesicles observed of the several lipid composition studied. Applicants have previously shown that positively charged vesicles were bound to EMT6 cells In further experiments, mice were injected with either a saline solution minus, , blockade or with 8 mg AM 2 vesicles one hour prior to injecting In 111 labeled vesicles of the compositions described in Figure 3. Tissue biodistribution was determined at twenty four 24 hours as described above. The saline solution provided a control and did not block the reticuloendothelial cells in the liver and spleen in the manner discussed above. The AM 2 vesicles provided a positive charge and were effective in blocking the reticuloendothelial cells in the liver and spleen. Since the reticuloendothelial cells in the liver and spleen were at least partially blocked with the AM 2 vesicles, any subsequent injection of phospholipid vesicles into the blood stream of the body had an increased opportunity for uptake by the tumor. Figure 1 indicates the amount of In 111 targeted to the different parts of the body when phospholipid vesicles containing In 111 are introduced into the blood stream without any previous blockade of the reticuloendothelial cells in the liver and spleen. In contrast, Figure 3 indicates the amount of In 111 targeted to the different parts of the body when phospholipid vesicles containing In 111 are introduced into the blood stream after a previous blockade of the reticuloendothelial cells in the liver and spleen. As can be seen by a comparison of Figures 1 and 3, the amount of the In 111 targeted to the tumor was significantly increased in most instances using the blockade. Furthermore, the amount of the In 111 received at the liver and spleen using the blockade was significantly reduced from the amount of the In 111 received at the liver and spleen in Figure 1. In the experiments discussed above, the second group of phospholipid vesicles to the be targeted to the tumor were introduced into the blood stream approximately one hour after the introduction of the initial group of phospholipid vesicles into the blood stream to block the reticuloendothelial cells in the liver and spleen. It will be appreciated that other time periods than one hour may also be used. For example, the time period may be considerably shorter than one hour. Since the phospholipid vesicles blocking the liver and spleen are effective for an extended period, the introduction of the phospholipid vesicles to target the tumor may be considered as concurrent with the introduction of the phospholipid vesicles to block the liver and spleen. Figure 4 indicates tumor and blood radioactivity levels at various time points after injection of neutral vesicle DSPC Ch, 2 1 mole ratio encapsulated In 111 NTA. Tumor associated radioactivity is maximal 24 hours after injection. Ninety percent of the radioactivity was cleared from the blood in 24 hours. This data suggests that Indium associated vesicles circulate intact in the blood and are selectively accumulated in the tumor over time. Gamma ray perturbed angular correlation PAC spectroscopy studies were performed on selected tissues at various times to confirm that the vesicles were intact in the bloodstream. Individual tumors and blood samples were examined by gamma ray PAC spectrometry at 1 to 48 hours after injection of Indium 111 labeled phospholipid vesicles. The PAC results presented in Figure 5 as fractional intact vesicles show that over 80 of the blood born radioactivity remains within vesicles up to 48 hours. On the other hand, the radioactivity accumulated in tumor is largely released from vesicles. This result indicates that the vesicles which become associated with tumors are being broken down or lysed and that the Indium 111 is binding to macromolecules such as proteins, whereas vesicles in the blood are remaining intact. The biodistributions for free In 111 EDTA and vesicle encapsulated In 111 EDTA were also studied to further demonstrate tumor localization of intact vesicles. Columns 1 and 2, Figure 6 . EDTA is a strong chelator as compared to NTA, and will not release Indium 111 to be bound by proteins. Furthermore, unbound Indium 111 EDTA is rapidly cleared from the blood and excreted via the kidneys. Thus, radioactivity remaining in the animal 24 hours after injection must come from or still be within intact vesicles and not from a protein bound intermediate. The results depicted in Figure 7 show that at twenty four 24 hours encapsulated Indium 111 EDTA exhibits pharmacokinetics identical to C 14 labeled vesicles. Free In 111 EDTA however, does not accumulate significantly in any of the tissues because it is rapidly excreted. The effect of labeling the membrane component rather than the internal aqueous space of the vesicles was then examined. Carbon 14 labeled DPPC tracer was added to vesicles in order to follow the biodistribution of the membrane component of the vesicles. Blood clearance and biodistributions within tissues were found to be similar to the experiments using In 111 labeling Column 3 of Figure 6 . Biodistribution studies of vesicle encapsulated Indium 111 NTA in mice bearing tumors of various types were also conducted. Figure 7 . Tumor associated radioactivity was at least 50 of the liver uptake on a per gram of tissue basis in seven of these tumor types. Lower relative tumor uptake was observed with colon adenocarcinoma 38 B 16 melanoma, and osteogenic sarcoma. These results suggest that different tumor types will accumulate Indium 111 to varying degrees. Autoradiography studies Fig. 8 were performed using techniques that allow sectioning through human cells. Many grains of exposure directly over the dense layer of rapidly growing EMT6 tumor cells at or near the surface of the tumor indicate the presence of vesicles in the tumor cells. In contrast, the inner necrotic core of the tumor produced little autoradiographic exposure. Adiopocytes and connective tissue at the periphery of the tumor mass also showed few grains of exposure. Liver sections also showed high autoradiographic exposure as would be expected from the overall uptake of label. The uniform density of silver grains over the entire section of liver confirm that small vesicles are reaching hepatocytes, as has been reported by others. Roerdink, et al., Control tissue sections showed uniformly low photographic exposure, thus assuring that the experimental exposures obtained were not artifactual. The phospholipid vesicles as constructed herein may be used to provide an enhanced delivery of drugs such as the chemotherapeutic agent methotrexate MTX to tumors in the body. This may be seen from the results of experiments specified in the table constituting Figure 9. To demonstrate MTX delivery, H 3 methotrexate H 3 MTX free and vesicle encapsulated, was injected directly into tumor bearing mice, The amount of the H 3 MTX in tumors was measured by scintillation counting after four hours. Phospholipid vesicles containing DSPC Ch SA in the ratio of 4 1 1 were labeled with C 14 cholesterol oleate and H 3 MTX was entrapped in the phospholipid vesicles. As will be seen, the amount of the phospholipid vesicles targeted to the tumors is almost three times greater than the amount of the free MTX directed to the tumor. The MTX uptake by tumor was further enhanced using neutral vesicles of the preferred composition DSPC Ch in the mole ratio of 2 1 . Figure 10 , The ratios of H 3 MTX uptake, free vs. unencapsulated, were 4.2 and 11.2 fold at three hours and sixteen hours respectively. There are several improvements in vesicle technology which are utilized in the present invention which may explain why better tumor imaging and delivery of intact vesicles into tumor cells are achieved. One such improvement is the use of small, chemically pure phospholipid containing hydrocarbon chains of at least 18 carbon atoms provides vesicles that are stable
