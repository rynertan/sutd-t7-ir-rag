# A sulfur containing fluorinated unsaturated compound and its manufacturing process.

## Abstract
There is provided a sulfur containing fluorinated α,β un saturated carbonyl compound expressed by a general formula, R CF CF S R² wherein R¹ and R² are independently an aliphatic or aro matic group with or without a substituent or substituents. Further, a process of manufacturing the above com pound wherein a halide of fluorinated carbonyl compound expressed by the general formula, R¹ CHF CF₂X wherein R¹ is an aliphatic or aromatic group with or whith out a substituent or substituents and X is a halogen atom, is reacted with a mercaptan expressed by a general formula, R² SH wherein R² is an aliphatic or aromatic group with or without a substituent or substituents, to produce a sulfur containing fluorinated carbonyl compound expressed by a general formula, R¹ CHF CF₂ S R² wherein R¹ and R² are the same as those of the starting ma terials, and this sulfur containing carbonyl compound is converted, by the elimination of hydrogen fluoride, to a sul fur containing fluorinated unsaturated carbonyl compound expressed by a general formula, R¹ CF CF S R² wherein R¹ and R² are the same as those of the starting ma terials.
