## Description
SEISMIC ISOLATION SYSTEM, INCLUDING MICROLITHOGRAPHY SYSTEM FOR SUBMICRON DESIGN RULE Background And Summary The present invention arose from efforts to develop a microlithography system for processing semiconductor wafers subject to a submicron design rule, though the invention is applicable to a wide variety of uses where seismic isolation is essential, especially those requiring accuracy on an extremely small scale. In microlithography systems for micron and multi micron design rule capability, the worktable of the system is isolated from floor motion to afford the required accuracy. To accomplish this isolation, systems typically employ a large inertial mass such as a granite block supported above the floor by soft springs such as air bags or air pistons that utilize the compressibility of a gas within a reservoir as the spring mechanism. Lateral isolation is accomplished by designing these vertical soft springs to have as little lateral compliance as possible. Further miniaturization now requires microlithography systems having submicron design rule capability, such as 0.1 micron overlay accuracy and 0.5 micron resolution. The above noted traditional type isolation techniques are inadequate for the level of accuracy required in submicron systems. Rather than passive isolation, the present invention instead or additionally provides inertially augmented active isolation. Furthermore, rather than position stabilization, the invention provides force or acceleration counteraction regardless of relative floor position or motion1 and variable changing thereof. The invention is particularly advantageous in a step and repeat microlithography system where stage motion for each exposure causes a reaction force in its supporting worktable and in turn a vibrational quiver. The present invention significantly reduces the resonant frequency and amplitude of worktable quiver, which in turn significantly reduces the delay time between exposures, and hence increases throughput.

FIG. 16 shows a further generalized system like FIG. 14. FIG. 17 shows force equations for FIG. 16. Detailed Description FIG. 1 shows a known prior art microlithography system 2 for processing a semiconductor wafer 4. The system includes a worktable 6 at position x having a large mass m such as a 900 pound granite block. Resilient support means 8 supports worktable 6 on floor 10 for isolating the worktable from floor vibration. Floor 10 is at position x0. Support 8 is typically a soft spring having a spring constant K provided by a pneumatic gas cylinder 12 having a piston 14 engaging the underside of worktable 6 and vertically slideable in cylinder chamber 16 which is fixed to the floor by supporting pedestal 18. A rubber bellows or rolling diaphragm 20 seals chamber 16 and provides lateral centering of the piston though it does have some lateral compliance to allow lateral motion.A three way valve 22 is connected through accumulator 24 to chamber 16 for supplying high pressure gas such as nitrogen at 80 pounds per square inch at input port 26 to chamber 16 to drive piston 14 upwardly. The gas may be controllably vented at exhaust port 28 to allow downward movement of piston 14. Valve 22 is controlled by a position reference such as potentiometer 30 giving the position of worktable 6 relative to floor 10 i.e., x1 x0. Worktable 6 is typically a rectangular member and is supported at all four corners by like supports such as 32. A stage 34, typically 35 to 100 pounds, is on worktable 6 for supporting semiconductor wafer 4. A projector 36 with appropriate optics is supported by frame or tower 38 on worktable 6 above stage 34 for exposing wafer 4. Stage 34 is laterally movable relative to worktable 6 and projector 36 to enable exposure of different portions. of wafer 4. Stepper command 40 controls movement of stage 34 and exposure by projector 36. Projector 36 is typically about three feet above the worktable and reduces the image by a factor of ten to place a one centimeter exposed image on the wafer. A six inch wafer would typically require about 180 exposures with a step and repeat method. FIG. 2 shows vibration transmissibility of the system of FIG. 1, plotting frequency versus amplitude response of worktable 6. Curve 42 shows a resonant peak at 44 and then a roll off Qr damping at 46 at about two hertz. Curve 48 shows a known improvement where the amplitude of the vibration is reduced as well as the resonant peak, but the resonant frequency is about the same, i.e., there is no significant rolloff or damping until beyond two hertz. FIG. 3 shows a block diagram for the system of FIG 1. The force 50 on worktable 6 is the summation of the various forces acting on it, as shown at the inputs to summer 52. One of these forces is the spring constant K of soft spring support 8 multiplied by the distance or floor displacement x0, as shown at 54. Another force is the pumping pressure or loss C of the gas through orifice 56. This force is a function of gas flow velocity and is thus C multiplied by the floor velocity x0, as shown at 58, and provides damping.The force 50 on the worktable is divided by its mass m at 60, yielding acceleration xl of worktable 6, which in turn is integrated with respect to time at 62 to yield velocity xl, which in turn is integrated with respective time at 64 to yield distance or displacment x1 of worktable 6. Displacement xl as measured by potentiometer 30 is compared to a set point Xref any error is integrated at 66 in loop 65 to provide the steady state pressure needed by support means 8 to support the worktable. Displacement xl is fed back in loop 67 by the spring constant K at 68 of support means 8, back to summer 52. Likewise the velocity xl is fed back in loop 70 to couple a pumping loss or damping component at 72 back to summer 52.It has been known in the prior art to fine tune the system of FIG. 1 by controlling the spring constant K and pumping losses C to improve performance from curve 42 of FIG. 2 to curve 48. FIG. 4 shows a microlithography system in accordance with the invention and uses like reference numerals as FIG. 1 where appropriate to facilitate clarity. Force applying means is provided by a linear forcer or linear motor, such as supplied by NorthernMagnetics, Inc., 16124 Wyandotte Street, Van Nuys,California 91406, called Normag DC linear motor, for applying force between floor 10 and worktable 6. It is preferred that each support such as 8 and 32 have a linear forcer such as 74 and 76 adjacent thereto, though other combinations are of course possible with more or less forcers than supports, and various combinations of four point suspensions, three point suspensions, one point suspension, and so on.Accelerometer means such as 78 is mounted or otherwise operatively coupled to worktable 6 to sense vertical acceleration of the worktable and is operatively coupled in feedback loop 80 to linear forcer 76 to actively isolate worktable 6 by applying force against sensed acceleration regardless of the position or movement of worktable 6 or variance thereof relative to floor 10. High pass filter means 82 is connected between accelerometer 78 and linear forcer 76 for passing only higher frequency components above low frequency DC type components such as constant gravity induced acceleration. High pass filter 82 may be a separate component or may be inherent in accelerometer 78. For example, a piezoelectric accelerometer typically has no DC or low frequency response and inherently passes only high frequency components.A strain gauge, however, does have DC low frequency response, and a separate high pass filter is then used. Feedback loop 80 has a feedback loop gain km controlled by amplifier 84. Accelerometer 86, feedback loop 88, high pass filter 90, and amplifier 92 are comparable. Another linear forcer 94 is provided for applying horizontal force between a sidewall reference 96 and worktable 6. A horizontal accelerometer 98 is connected to worktable 6 to sense horizontal acceleration of the worktable and is operatively coupled through feedback loop 100 with high pass filter 102, and amplifier 104 to horizontal linear forcer 94 for passing only higher frequency components thereto.Other horizontal accelerometers not shown are also connected to the worktable at other corners and at 90 orientation relative to accelerometer 98. Horizontal accelerometer 98 is also coupled by a feedback loop 106 through a low pass filter 108, and amplifier 110 to vertical linear forces 74 and 76 for passing only lower frequency components thereto, including DC and constant gravity induced acceleration, to supplement the higher frequency components from loops 88 and 80 from vertical accelerometers 86 and 78, to compensate tilting of worktable 6 upon lateral shifting of stage 34 changing the center of gravity of the system. In the embodiment in FIG. 4, vertical linear forcers 74 and 76 are offset from the center of gravity of the system, and the output of horizontal accelerometer 98 through feedback loop 106 and low pass filter 108 is added to linear forcer 74 and subtracted from linear forcer 76 on the opposite side of the center of gravity of the system.Stepper command 40, which coordinates lateral movement of stage 34 for exposure by projector 36 as in FIG. 1, may also be operatively coupled at 112 to feedback loop 106 and vertical linear forcers 74 and 76 to apply a predictive correction signal thereto knowing beforehand the direction and displacement of lateral movement of the stage, to further compensate tilting of worktable 6 caused by lateral stage movement. FIG. 5 shows a block diagram of FIG. 4, comparably to FIGS. 3 and 1, and like reference numerals are used where appropriate to facilitate clarity. Another force being summed in summer 52 is shown at 114, which is the stage force due to the mass of the stage M5 multiplied its acceleration as during the step and repeat process. Sensed acceleration xl of the worktable is fed back in loop 80 with gain km for the vertical linear forcer loop. The block diagram for the horizontal linear forcer feedback loop would be the same. The acceleration feedback loop shown in dashed line box 116 in FIG. 5 is reproduced in simplified form in FIG. 6 with a forward loop factor A and a feedback loop factor B. According to standard loop transformation, the loop in box 116 is equivalent to that shown in box 118.Substituting in the value for A as m m and the value for B as kmt results in box 120, which by algebraic rearrangement yields box 122. Box 122 may thus be substituted for box 116 in FIG. 5. It is thus seen that the mass m of worktable 6 as shown in box 60 in FIG. 5 has now been effectively increased to a dynamic mass which is equal to muck,. The dynamic mass has been increased without increasing the spring constant K of the supports such as 8, and without increasing the static mass. Furthermore, since the resonant frequency is proportional to the square root of the ratio of the spring constant K to the mass m, the resonant frequency of worktable 6 is reduced by a factor ofEMI8.1 This is particularly significant in a step and repeat system.For example, if the loop gain is is selected such that m km 4m, then the resonant frequency is cut in half, as shown at curve 124 in FIG.2. If the loop gain km is such. that m km 100m, then the resonant frequency is reducedby a factor of 10, as shown at curve 126 in FIG. 2. By increasing the dynamic mass of worktable 6 and reducing its resonant frequency below the significant floor vibration frequencies, the amplitude of worktable quiver due to coupled floor motion is reduced. Furthermore, internal reaction forces such as those due to stage motion cause significantly less worktable motion. This in turn enables a much faster step and repeat process, increasing throughput. This is important because semiconductor processing equipment is very expensive, and, for example, doubling the throughput saves the cost of a second system. Upon comparing FIGS. 4 and 1, it will be noted that the present invention may provide an add on system for an existing soft spring supported large mass worktable in a microlithography system. The soft spring supports such as 8 and 32 are augmented with linear forcers such as 74 and 76 having a substantially lower supporting capability than the soft spring supports and applying force to worktable 6 at floor vibration frequencies. In FIG. 1, a typical spring constantK for the supporting means for worktable 6 is about 400 pounds per inch. Thus in a four point suspension system with a soft spring support such as 8 at each corner of a rectangular member, each soft spring 8 has a spring constant K of 100 pounds per inch. Referring to FIG. 4, it is not necessary that linear forcer 74 have this same supporting capability.In fact, the invention enables linear forcer 74 to have a much lower supporting capability, which is desirable because the cost of a linear forcer increases with increasing supporting capability. It is only necessary that the floor or worktable motion stay within a selected range. For example, if soft spring support 8 has a 100 pound per inch spring constant K, and a 10 pound linear forcer 74 is used, the floor can move 0.1 inch before being out of range. If a 50 pound forcer is used, the floor can move 0.5 inch, and so on. If the spring rate of support 8 is reduced for example to 50 pounds per inch, and a 50 pound forcer 74 is used, the range of movement is one inch. Floor motion versus frequency is thus no longer a limiting factor, but instead the range of movement is. The cost of retrofitting existing equipment with the present invention to increase throughput is dramatically less than the cost of a second system. The present invention overcomes the current compromise situation regarding selection of spring stiffness namely, the apparently heretofore incompatible aspects of stiffness to prevent tilt, yet softness to isolate floor motion. Lateral movement of stage 34 shifts the center of gravity of the system, which causes tilting. Previously, two things could be done. The spring constant K of support 8 could be made stiff enough so that the lateral displacement of stage 34 doesn t cause a significant tilt. However, the trade off with a stiff spring is increased coupling of floor motion to worktable 6, which defeats the purpose of isolation. Alternatively, the gas valve 22 feedback system could be made more sensitive and fast enough to pump gas into chamber 16 to prevent the tilt.However, this sensitive fast response would also be sensitive to floor motion and rapidly couple floor vibration to the worktable, which again defeats the purpose of isolation. The present invention overcomes this dilemma and provides the stiffness needed in response to center of gravity displacement, and does so without changing the spring constant K. The invention further provides a very low breakpoint or resonant frequency, FIG. 2, below significant floor vibration frequencies, such that the latter are severely attenuated. Rather than position stabilization, the invention instead or additionally provides force or acceleration counteraction and feeds back sensed acceleration xl independent of position, independent of floor reference motion, and independent of variation of each. The vertical isolation system isolates the worktable against low frequency unbalances such as shifts in the location of the center of mass of the system due to stage motion, isolates the worktable against high frequency reaction forces such as those due to the vertical component of stage motion acceleration, and isolates the worktabie against floor vibration induced forces.The horizontal isolation system isolates the worktable against lo frequed reaction ioL ees, high frequency reaction forces due to stage acceleration, and lateral forces induced by horizontal floor vibration. As noted above, these forces have traditionally presented apparently contradictory system mechanization requirements. Maximum isolation of the worktable from its environment, such as the floor, implied minimum v 7h damping of internally generated reaction force induced worktable motions. Actually, these requirements are not contradictory and are now concurrently enabled by the present invention. In a further improvement in accordance with the invention, the sensed vertical acceleration from accelerometer 78, FIG. 4, in feedback loop 80 is integrated at 128 and operatively coupled with positive gain kc controlled by amplifier 130 to linear forcer 76 to inertially derive and increase damping of worktable 6 without increasing stiffness of the coupling support provided by soft spring support 32, i.e., without increasing damping constant C. The preferred embodiment eliminates damping coefficient C and relies on the inertially derived damping entirely. Thus, floor motion is not coupled through C to the worktable. The loop gain in feedback loop 80, FIG. 7, is a factor of km kc 1 ,i.e., km plus the quantity kc times the S integral with respect to time of the acceleration xl.A single amplifier may provide the function of amplifiers 84 and 130 if further upstream in the feedback loop, though the dual amplifiers are preferred in order to individually control the loop gain contribution factors km and kc, which are respectively the acceleration component gain factor for increasing dynamic mass and the velocity component gain factor for inertially increasing dynamic damping. The sensed acceleration from vertical accelerometer 86 is likewise integrated at 132 and operatively coupled with feedback gain at 134 to linear forcer 74. The sensed accelera tion from horizontal accelerometer 98 in feedback loop 100 is likewise integrated at 136 and operatively fed back with gain at 138 to horizontal linear forcer 94.Sensed acceleration from horizontal accelerometer 98 in feedback loop 1p6 is also integrated at 140 and fed back with gain at 142 to vertical linear forcers 74 and 76. FIG. 7 shows the block diagram of FIG. 4, comparably to FIG. 5, and to FIGS. 3 and 1, and like reference numerals are used where appropriate to facilitate clarity. The feedback loop in dashed box 132 inFIG. 7 is also shown in dashed box in FIG. 8 where the forward loop factor A of FIG. 6 is 1 and the m return feedback loop factor B of FIG. 6 is km k 1 S. Using the loop transformation of FIG. 6 between boxes 116 and 118, dashed box 132 of FIG. 8 is rewritten as shown to the right thereof at box 132a. Algebraic rearrangement yields box 132b. Box 132b is the equivalent of box 132 and is substituted for box 132 in FIG.7, yielding FIG. 9. Dashed box 134 in FIG. 9 is shown in FIG. 10 and the forward loop factor A, per FIG. 6, is m km kc 1 all integrated with respect to time S at 62, and the return feedback loop factor B is C.Using the loop transformation of FIG. 6 yields box 134a, and algebraic rearrangement yields equivalent boxes 134b and 134c. Box 134c is substituted for its equivalent box 134 in FIG. 9, and the result is FIG.11. In FIG. 11, the loop in dashed box 136 is shown in FIG. 12 with the forward loop factor A as shown, and the return feedback loop factor B equal toK. Using the loop transformation of FIG. 6 yields equivalent box 136a, and algebraic rearrangement yields equivalent boxes 136b, 136c and 136d for outputting displacement distance xl, which is shown by the equation in FIG. 13.The distance or displacement xl of worktable 6 is thus equal to the input force Kxo Cxo any other reaction forces F such as M5 and as, divided by the quantity the mass m of the worktable plus the acceleration dynamic gain factor km differentiated twice with respect to time plus the inertial or dynamic damping gain factor kc plus the pumping or existent damping loss constant, which is proportional to velocity differentiated with respect to time plus the spring constant K. Referring to FIG. 14, there is shown a general case with body 150 of mass m supported on the floor 152 by support means 154 of spring constant K having a pumping loss or damping component C at 156.The force on block 150 is shown at the first equation in FIG. 15, namely the mass m of the body times acceleration xl plus damping or pumping constant C times velocity xl plus spring constant K times distance xl. Algebraic rearrangement yields the second equation in FIG. 15 where the force is equal to the mass m times the distance xl differentiated twice with respect to time plus damping constant C times the distance xl differentiated with respect to time plus spring constant K times displacement xl. Solving for x1 yields the last equation in FIG. 15. Upon comparing the equation in FIG. 13 and the last equation in FIG. 15, it is seen that the mass m of FIG. 14 has been increased by the present invention to a dynamic mass of m km. It is further seen that the pumping loss or damping coefficient C of FIG.14 and the last equation of FIG. 15 has been increased to a dynamic or inertial damping coefficient of kC C. It is particularly noteworthy that the additional factors km and kc are in the denominator of the frac tion in FIG. 13, and hence reduce the value of xl, and hence minimize displacement of the worktable. FIG. 16 shows a variant of FIG. 14, taking into account floor motion by assigning the reference floor position at x0 and a reference body position at xl, and using like reference numerals for the remaining components with the subscript a . The force equations are shown in FIG. 17, with the final equation the solution for xl with F 0. The floor displacement x0 due to spring constant K and damping constant C is in the numerator in the last equation in FIG. 17. The present invention increases C in the denominator to C kc, FIG.13, by feeding back integrated acceleration of body 150a with positive gain kc to inertially derive and increase dynamic damping of the body, without increasing the transmissibility of floor motion into the system. The term kc enables independent control of damping of the system. Furthermore, since kc can control damping, the pumping loss C can theoretically be eliminated or, as a practical matter, minimized as much as possible, which loss reduction is highly desirable, since this eliminates one of the floor motion coupling terms. The inertially derived damping term k c thus enables a substantial reduction in unwanted coupling between the floor and the body. In its general form, the invention thus provides seismic isolation system for a body 6 of mass m supported relative to a reference such as floor 10 and or sidewall 96. Sensed acceleration is operatively coupled to linear forcers 74, 76, 94 and so on, to isolate the body by applying force against the acceleration regardless of the position of the body or variance thereof relative to the reference such as floor 10 or sidewall 96. The invention is also useful for isolating a body subject to structural resonance, wherein force is applied to isolate the body against resonance induced acceleration, for example at a plurality of points between nodes. In a further use, the invention may be applied to a body having a first portion subject to structural resonance, and a second portion which may be subject to more, less or about the same structural resonance as the first portion, and wherein the force applying means applies force between the first and second portions, effectively using the second portion as a reference, for example where the second portion is relatively rigid and the first portion may flex relative thereto.The rigid body portion may be fixed to the floor or other reference, or may be isolated, immobilized or fixed, in accordance with the invention, such as for granite block 6, with the other body portion such as tower 38 being subject to flexure or resonance relative thereto, and with immobilizing force being applied between tower 38 and granite block 6 and or an extension thereof or a reference. Whether the whole body or only a portion thereof is subject to structural resonance, the force applying means may apply force between such body and either a stationary or movable reference because it is only necessary that force be applied, i.e., the reference may be subject to substantially less structural resonance than the body or may be subject to about the same structural resonance as the body or may be subject to more structural resonance than the body. In the present invention, the body is isolated regardless of movement or position or variance, of the reference relative to the body by effectively removing energy therefrom. It is recognized that various alternatives and modifications are possible within the scope of the appended claims.
