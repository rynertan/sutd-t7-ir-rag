# PSEUDOPLASTIC GEL TRANSFER

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method for the incorporation of an agent into structural substrate which comprises forming a pseudoplastic gel as defined in the specification comprising an active agent at least one solvent therefor and at least one gel forming agent and thereafter applying said gel to the structure to be treated. The invention also includes apparatus comprising means for conveying a structure 1 to a coating station 2, 6 coating means 2, 6 at said coating station to supply a coating of pseudoplastic gels at a predetermined depth to said struc ture surface and to urge the gel into contact with the structure surface whereby a predetermined gel penetration of the structure is achieved before 75 of the solvent has evaporated and thereafter passing the material into a drying area 5 to complete the removal of the solvent.
