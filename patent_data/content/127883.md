A preferred group of 6 2 imidazolin 2 yl thieno and furo 2,3 bjpyridine and 5 2 imidazolin2 yl thieno and furo 3,2 bjpyridine compounds have the formula shown as Ia and Ib above, wherein Rl is methyl R2 is methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, or when taken together form a cyclohexyl or methylcyclohexyl ring W is oxygen or sulfur B is hydrogen A is COOR3, where R3 is as described above Y and Z are hydrogen,Cl C3 alkyl, Cl C3 alkoxy, alkylthio, halo, nitro, cyano, trifluoromethyl, monofluoromethyl, difluoromethyl, monofluoromethoxy, difluoromethoxy, trifluoromethoxy, methylsulfonyl, methylsulfonamido, methylamino, dimethylamino, or isopropylamino and when Y andZ are taken together, YZ is CH2 3, CH2 4 , or CH CH CH CH . The most preferred formula Ia and Ib 2 imidazolin 2 yl thieno and furo compounds are those wherein B is H, Y and Z are hydrogen, chloro, methyl or methoxy provided that one of either Y or Z is hydrogen W is oxygen A is COOR3 where R3 is hydrogen, furfuryl, propynyl, C3 haloalkenyl, Nad or isopropylammonium andR1 and R2 are as defined for the preferred compounds. It should also be understood that when B isH the imidazolinyl thieno and furo 2,3 b and 13,2 bl pyridines represented by formula Ia and Ib above may be tautomeric. While, for convenience, they are depicted by single structures identified as formula Ia and Ib , they may exist in either of the tautomeric forms illustrated as follows EMI5.1 As such, both tautomeric forms of said imidazolinylpyridines are meant to be included under the formula Ia and Ib definition. The present invention also relates to novel substituted thieno and furoimidazopyrrolopyridinedione compounds of structure via and IIb below and a method for controlling undesirable annual and perennial plant species therewith in soybeans and certain cereal crops EMI5.2 wherein X, Y, Y , Z, Z , W, R1 and R2 are as described for Ia and Ib above and wherein X, Y, Z, W, R1 andR2 in the preferred and most preferred formula IIa and IIb compounds are as described for the preferred and most preferred formula Ia and formula Ib compounds. Herbicidal substituted pyridine and quinoline2 imidazolin 2 yl acids, esters and salts are disclosed in European Patent Application Number 81103638.3 filed December 1, 1981. The present invention relates to novel thieno and furol2,3 b pyridines and thieno and furo13,2 b pyridines which when substituted in the 6 or 5 position with an imidazolinone ring and in the 5 or 6 position with a group A as previously defined, provide potent herbicidal agents. The finding that imidazolinyl thieno and furopyridines provide potent herbicides is unexpected as there is no prior indication that such 12,3 b or 3,2 b ring systems may be employed for any agronomic or herbicidal utility. This new class of herbicidal agents is highly effective when applied as a pre or postemergence treatment, and individual members of this class exhibit unusual selectivity in soybean and cereal crops such as wheat, barley, rice, rye and oats. Further, it has been found that selectivity in cereals may be enhanced when A is CO2H, by the preparation of esters, particularly furfuryl, alkynyl and haloalkenyl esters. Additionally some members of this class exhibit unexpected plant growth regulating effects such as reduced plant height and anti lodging activity and increased tillering in cereal crops. The compounds of the present invention may conveniently be prepared from the appropriately substituted thieno and furo 2,3 b and 3,2 b pyridine dicarboxylic acids and esters of formula IIIa and IIIb EMI7.1 wherein X, Y and Z are as previously described and R is methyl or ethyl. Methods suitable for preparing novel formula Ia and formula Ib unsaturated compounds wherein is a double bond from the novel formula IIla and IIIb pyridinedicarboxylic acid esters are illustrated in Flow Diagram I below. Thus formula IIIa and IIIb diesters may be hydrolyzed to the corresponding thieno and furo2,3 pyridinedicarboxylic acids of formula IVa and IVb by reaction thereof with a strong base such as potassium hydroxide or sodium hydroxide. Acid anhydrides of formula Va and Vb may then be prepared by treatment of the formula IVa and IVb pyridinedicarboxylic acids with, for example, acetic anhydride. Reaction of formula Va and Vb anhydrides with an appropriately substituted aminocarboxamide or aminothiocarboxamide depicted by formula VI yields carbamoyl nicotinic acids of formula VIIa and VIIb .Treatment of the thus formed formula VIla and VIIb carbamoyl nicotinic acids with about 2 to 10 molar equivalents of aqueous or aqueous alcoholic sodium or potassium hydroxide, preferably under a blanket of inert gas such as nitrogen, cooling and acidifying to pH 2 to 4 with a strong mineral acid such as hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid gives herbicidally effective 6 4,4 disubstituted 5 oxo or thioxo 2imidazolin 2 yl thieno and furo 2,3 bjpyridine 5 carboxylic acids, and 5 4,4 disubstituted 5 oxo or thioxo 2 imidazolin 2 yl thieno and furot3,2 bJ pyridine 6 carboxylic acids encompassed by formulas Ia and Ib . Formula Ia and Ib 5 or 6 2 imidazolin 2yl thieno and furopyridine esters, wherein A is COOR3 and R3 represents a substituent other than hydrogen or a salt forming cation, and Rl, R2, X, Y and Z are as described above can be prepared by reacting a novel thieno or furoimidazopyrrolopyridinedione, represented by formulas IIa and IIb , hereinbelow, in FlowDiagram II , with an appropriate alcohol and corresponding alkali metal alkoxide at a temperature ranging between about 200C and about 500C. Formula I Ia and IIb novel thieno and furoimidazopyrrolopyridinediones may conveniently be prepared fro formula vIa and Ib acids, where B is H by treatment with one equivalent of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide in an inert solvent such as methylene chloride as illustrated in Flow Diagram II below.

Many formula lIla thieno 2,3 b pyridinedi carboxylic acids and IlIb thieno 3,2 b pyridinedi carboxylic acids may conveniently be prepared by reacting the appropriately substituted 2 or 3 aminothiophene of formula VIlla or VIIIb , where R is hydrogen or chloro, with a Cl C4 alkyl ester of acetylenedicarboxylic acid of formula IX as described by Bleckert et al. Chem. Ber. 1978, 106, 368.The thus formed ss aminothieno alpha ,ss unsaturated ester of formula X is then reacted with an immonium salt depicted by the formula Cl CH CH N R 2 Cl wherein R is C1 C6 alkyl or Cl CH N CH2 n C where n is 4 or 5, in the presence of a low boiling chlorinated hydrocarbon solvent such as methylene chloride or dichloroethane at a temperature between about 400C and 900C, for a period of time sufficient to essentially complete the reaction and yield the formula tufa 12,3 b3 thieno or IIIb 3,2 blthieno 2,3 pyridinedicarbo xylic acid as the dialkyl ester as illustrated in FlowDiagram III below, Formula limb furo 3,2 b pyridinedicarboxylic acids may be prepared by reacting 3 amino 2formylfuran of formula XI prepared by the method ofS.Gronowitz et al., Acta Chemica Scand B29 224 1975 with ethyl oxalacetate to give formula lib furopyridine compounds directly, as illustrated in FlowDiagram IV below while formula IIIa furo 2,3 b pyridine compounds where Y and Z are H are obtained by bromination of the reaction product XII of acetoacetamide with the diethyl ester of ethoxymethyleneoxalacetic acid followed by treatment with sodium borohydride and para toluene sulfonic acid in refluxing xylene as illustrated in Flow Diagram V below. Formula IIIb 2,3 dihydrofuro 3,2 b and thieno 3,2 b pyridines may be prepared by the reaction of diethylethoxymethylene oxalacetate with a mixture of enamines derived from 3 keto tetrahydrofuran or 3 ketotetrahydrothiophene, followed by treatment with ammonia or ammonium, as illustrated in Flow Diagram VI .

Formula IIla furo 2,3 b pyridine compounds where Z is H and Y is alkyl or optionally substituted phenyl are prepared by reaction of an acetylene compound with the iodopyridine diester VII preparation of this compound VII is described in J. Prakt. Chem., 148 72 1937 1, in the presence of cuprous salts, an amine base, and a palladium II catalyst as shown inFlow Diagram VII . FLOW DIAGRAM VII EMI19.1 Substituents represented by Y and Z in formula Ia , Ib , IIa and IIb compounds of the present invention may be prepared either by using the appropriately substituted starting material for the preparation of formula lila and IIIb thieno and furopyridine 5,6 dicarboxylic acid esters or by electrophilic substitution halogenation, nitration, sulfonation, etc. directly upon Formula IIIa or IIIb diesters or Formula Ia or Ib final products, wherein at least one of Y or Z is hydrogen. These substitutedFormula lIla , IlIb , Ia and Ib compounds then may be used as starting materials for additional Y and Z substitution by displacement, reduction, oxidation, etc.Representative substituted IIIa and IIIb compounds which may be prepared by these procedures are as illustrated below.EMI20.1 IIIa IIIb X Y Z RS H H CH3S H Br CH3S CH3 H CH3S H Cl CH3S Cl Cl CH3S H I CH3S H N02 CH3S Br Br CH3 EMI21.1 tb X SEP Y SEP z SEP R tb S SEP CH3 SEP Cl SEP CH3 tb S SEP H SEP CH3 SEP CH3 tb S SEP Cl SEP H SEP CH3 tb S SEP CH3 SEP CH3 SEP CH3 tb S SEP H SEP CN SEP CH3 tb S SEP H SEP OCH3 SEP CH3 tb S SEP H SEP N CH3 2 SEP CH3 tb S SEP H SEP SCH3 SEP CH3 tb S SEP H SEP OCF2H SEP CH3 tb O SEP H SEP H SEP C2H5 tb O SEP H SEP Br SEP CH3 tb O SEP H SEP Br SEP C2H5 tb O SEP H SEP Cl SEP CH3 tb O SEP H SEP Cl SEP C2H5 tb O SEP CH3 SEP H SEP CH3 tb O SEP CH3 SEP H SEP C2H5 tb O SEP H SEP CH3 SEP CH3 tb O SEP C2H5 SEP H SEP CH3 tb O SEP H SEP C2HS SEP CH3 tb O SEP CH3 SEP CH3 SEP CH3 tb S SEP CH2 3 SEP CH3 tb S SEP OH2 4 SEP CH3 tb S SEP GH 4 SEP OH3 tb S SEP C6H5 SEP H SEP CH3 tb O SEP CgH5 SEP H SEP CH3 tb S SEP H SEP 50 SEP 4 SEP H3 SEP CH3 tb SEP CH3 tb X y Z RS H OC6H5 CH3O H OC6H5 CH3O CF3 H CH3O H N02 C2H5O Br Br C2H5 o H C6H5S C2H5O H CF3 C2H5 Additionally, novel herbicidal 2,3 dihydro thieno 2,3 b and 3,2 bipyridine compounds may be obtained by starting the sequence in Flow Diagram III above with a dihydrothiophenimin hydrochloride.Novel herbicidal 2,3 dihydro furo 2,3 b and 3,2 b pyridines may be prepared by catalytic reduction of the formula Ia or Ib 2 imidazolin 2 yl product, or IIIa and IIIb furo 2,3 b and 3,2 b pyridine 5,6 diesters as for example with hydrogen and palladium on carbon, provided that Y and Z are substituents which are not reduced by such a procedure. Other 2,3 dihydrofuro 12,3 b pyridines are prepared by the reduction rearrangement of a bromo ketone with sodium borohydride followed by treatment with triethylamine, and p toluene sulfonic acid as shown in Flow Diagram VIII . This then provides novel 2,3 dihydro herbicidal compounds illustrated below.EMI23.1 wherein X, Y, Y , Z, Z , W, B, R1 and R3 are as described for Ia and Ib . FLOW DIAGRAM VIII EMI24.1 FLOW DIAGRAM VIII Continued EMI25.1 The formula Ia and formula Ib 6 2imidazolin 2 yl thieno and furo 2,3 blpyridines and 5 2 imidazolin 2 yl thieno and furo 3,2 bjpyridines and the formula I Ia and formula IIb imidazopyrrolopyridinediones of the present invention are exceedingly effective herbicidal agents useful for the control of an exceptionally wide variety of herbaceous and woody annual and perennial monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants. Moreover, these compounds are herbicidally effective for controlling weeds indigenous to both dry land and wet land areas.They are also useful as aquatic herbicides and are unique in their effectiveness in controlling the above said plants when applied to the foliage thereof or to soil or water containing seeds or other propagating organs of said plants such as tubers, rhizomes or stolons, at rates of from about 0.016 to 4.0 kg ha, and preferably at rates from about 0.032 to 2.0 kglha. It is, of course, obvious that rates of application above the 4.0 kg ha level can also be used to effectively kill undesirable plant species however, rates of application of toxicant above the level necessary to kill the undesirable plants should be avoided since application of excessive amounts of toxicant is costly and serves no useful function in the environment. Among the plants which may be controlled with the compounds of this invention are Elatine triandra,Sagittaria pygmaea, Scirpus hotarui, Cyperus serotinus,Eclipta alba, Cyperus difformis, Rotala indica,Lindernia pyridoria, Echinochloa crus galli, Digitaria sanguinalis, Setaria viridis, Cyperus rotundus, Convolvulus arvensis, Agropyron repens, Datura stramonium,Alopercurus myosuroides, Ipomoea spy., Sida spinosa,Ambrosia artemisiifolia, Eichhornia crassipes, Xanthium pensylvanicum, Sesbania exaltata, Avena fatua, Abutilon theophrasti, Bromus tectorum, Sorghum halepense, Lolium spy., Panicum dichotomiflorum, Matricaria spp., Amaranthus retroflexus, Cirsium arvense and Rumex iaponicus. It has been found that the formula la and Ib 2 imidazolin 2 yl thieno and furopyridines are generally selective herbicides, particularly effective for controlling undesirable weeds in the presence of leguminous crops such as soybeans, and cereal crops such as wheat, barley, oats and rye. However, certain of the formula Ia and formula Ib compounds are less selective than others in this series. It has also been found that several of the formula Ia and formula Ib 2 imidazolin 2 yl pyridines are effective as antilodging agents in cereal crops when applied at rates of application between about 0.016 to 4.0 kg hectare. At rates of application not exceeding about 0.010 kg per hectare, it has also been found that certain of the formula Ia and formula Ib thieno and furopyridines are effective for increasing branching of leguminous crops and tillering of cereal crops. Since the formula Ia and formula Ib imidazolinylthieno and furopyridines and derivatives, wherein R3 is a salt forming cation, are water soluble, these compounds can simply be dispersed in water and applied as a dilute aqueous spray to the foliage of plants or to soil containing propagating organs thereof. These salts also lend themselves to formulation as flowable concentrates. The formula Ia and formula Ib 2 imidazolin 2 yl thieno and furopyridines and the formula Ila and formula IIb imidazopyrrolopyridinediones can also be formulated as wettable powders, flow concentrates, emulsifiable concentrates, granular formulations and the like. Wettable powders can be prepared by grinding together about 20 to 45 by weight of a finely divided carrier such as kaolin, bentonite, diatomaceous earth, attapulgite, or the like, 45 to 80 by weight of the active compound, 2 to 5 by weight of a dispersing agent such as sodium lignosulfonate, and 2 to 5 by weight of a nonionic surfactant, such as octylphenoxy polyethoxy ethanol, nonylphenoxy polyethoxy ethanol or the like. A typical flowable liquid can be prepared by admixing about 40Z by weight of the active ingredient with about 2 by weight of a gelling agent such as bentonite, 3 by weight of a dispersing agent such as sodium lignosulfonate, 1 by weight of polyethylene glycol and 545 by weight of water. A typical emulsifiable concentrate can be prepared by dissolving about 5 to 25 by weight of the active ingredient in about 65 to 90 by weight ofN methylpyrrolidone, isophorone, butyl cellosolve, methylacetate or the like and dispersing therein about 5 to 10 by weight of a nonionic surfactant such as an alkylphenoxy polyethoxy alcohol. This concentrate is dispersed in water for application as a liquid spray. When the compounds of the invention are to be used as herbicides where soil treatments are involved, the compounds may be prepared and applied as granular products. Preparation of the granular product can be achieved by dissolving the active compound in a solvent such as methylene chloride, N methylpyrrolidone or the like and spraying the thus prepared solution on a granular carrier such as corncob grits, sand, attapulgite, kaolin or the like. The granular product thus prepared generally comprises about 3 to 20 by weight of the active ingredient and about 97 to 80 by weight of the granular carrier. In order to facilitate a further understanding of the invention, the following examples are presented primarily for the purpose of illustrating certain more specific details thereof. The invention is not to be deemed limited thereby except as defined in the claims. Unless otherwise noted, all parts are by weight.

exemplified by the following tests in which the seeds of a variety of monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants are separately mixed with potting soil and planted on top of approximately one inch of soil in separate pint cups.After planting, the cups are sprayed with the selected aqueous acetone solution containing test compound in sufficient quantity to provide the equivalent of about 0.016 to 10 kg per hectare of test compound per cup.The treated cups are then placed on greenhouse benches, watered and cared for in accordance with conventional greenhouse procedures. From four to five weeks after treatment, the tests are terminated and each cup is examined and rated according to the rating system set forth above. The herbicidal proficiency of the active ingredients of the present invention is evident from the test results which are recorded in Table II below.Where more than one test is involved for a given compound, the data are averaged.

test, wherein barley Hordeum vulgare is treated with a test compound dissolved in aqueous acetone. In the test, the compound dissolved acetone water mixtures 50 50 containing 0.25 by volume ofColloidal Multi film X 77 surfactant alkylarylpolyoxy ethyleneglycols, free fatty acids and isopropanol ofColloidal Products Corporation Petaluma, California in sufficient quantities to provide the equivalent of about 0.00625 kg to 0.10 kg per hectare of active compound when applied to the plants when the first node is detectable Zadok 30 . After spraying, the plants are placed on greenhouse benches and are cared for in the usual manner, commensurate with conventional greenhouse practices. From 11 to 12 weeks after treatment the plants are measured and harvested. The heads are removed and dried for 48 hours at 85 to 900C and weights recorded. The data obtained are recorded in Table III below.
