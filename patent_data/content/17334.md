# Solar panel module.

## Abstract
A solar panel module 10 is provided, wherein a plurality of solar panels 20 are electrically interconnected and supported within a low cost frame assembly 14 , which may conveniently be formed from wood products. Each solar panel 20 is provided with extending conductors for electric al connections with adjacent solar panels. The desired solar panel is formed in a backwall configuration where solar radiation is incident on the transparent vitreous substrate. The panel surface opposite the substrate is sealed, prefer ably with a bituminous material, to minimize permeation of the solar panel by environmental elements. The sealing material cooperates with the frame to provide an insulated exposed surface. In one embodiment, the completed module is formed to external dimensions generally standard in the building industry for easy installation.
