# Method for purification of 6 D 2 D 2 amino 3 N methylcarbamoylpropionamido 2 p hydroxyphenylacetamido penicillanic acid.

## Abstract
Crude 6 D 2 D 2 amino 3 N methylcarbamoyl propionamido 2 p hydroxyphenylacetamido penicillanic acid can be purified by the steps of A contacting an aqueous solution of 6 D 2 D 2 amino 3 methylcarbamoyl propionamido 2 p hydroxyphenylacetamido penicillanic acid with a nonpolar, macroporous styrene divinylbenzyle copolymer adsorption resin to adsorb 6 D 2 D 2 amino 3 N methylcarmaboyl propionamido 2 p hydroxyphenylacetamido penicillanic acid on the resin, B eluting the adsorbed 6 D 2 D 2 amino 3 N methylcarbamoyl propionamido 2 p hydroxyphenylacetamido penicillanic acid with water or a mixture of water and a water miscible organic solvent, and then C isolating pure 6 D 2 D 2 amino 3 N methyl carbamoyl propionamido 2 p hydroxyphenyl acetamido penicillanic acid from the eluates.
