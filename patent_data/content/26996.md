# Bladed centrifugal blasting wheel.

## Abstract
A bladed contrifugal blasting wheel formed of a pair of spaced parallel wheel 10, 12 plates having a central opening 34, 36 through which blades 22 are inserted into grooves 20 extending radially from the central opening 34, 36 through the adjacent surfaces of the wheel plates 10, 12 . The wheel comprises means for locking the blades 22 between the wheel plates 10, 12 an impeller 38 and control cage 66 for feeding particulate material onto the ends of the blades 22 , an annular centering flange 114 forming a part of the im peller 38 for locating the blades 22 in the central opening 36 , a resilient ring member 112 adapted to be engaged by the blades 22 upon insertion for holding the inserted blades 22 during assembly, indicator means for showing the position of the control cage 66 and means 130 for providing an air curtain to prevent accumulation of stray or rebound abrasive in the hub seal area during rotation of the bladed wheel.
