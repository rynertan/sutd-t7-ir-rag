# Ablative photodecomposition of organic biological material.

## Abstract
Photoetching organic biological matter is effected with out requiring heat as the dominant etching mechanism. Far ultraviolet radiation having one or more of wavelengths less than 200 nm is used to selectively remove organic biological material, where the radiation has an energy fluence suffi ciently great to cause ablative photodecomposition i.e. bond breaking and resulting generation of volatile or gaseous products which explode away from the irradiated material. Either continuous wave or pulse radiation can be used, a suitable ultraviolet light source being an ArF excimer laser having an output at 193 nm. The exposed biological material is ablatively photodecomposed without heating or damage to the rest of the organic material. Medical and dental applications include the removal of damaged or unhealthy tissue from bone, removal of skin lesions, cutting or sectioning healthy tissue, and the treatment of decayed teeth.

## Description
ABLATIVE PHOTDECOMPOSITION OF ORGANIC BIOLOGICAL MATERIAL DESCRIPTION Technical FieldThis invention relates to abaltive photodecomposition of organic biological material using far ultraviolet radiation of wavelength less than 200 nm. Ablative photodecomposition is more fully discussed hereinafter. Briefly organic biological material is exposed. to W radiation of sufficient energy to break the constituent bonds of the material, resulting in volatile or gaseous products, typically of low molecular weight, which explode away from the material, so that it is photo etched. Background ArtThe use of radiation from lasers in medical and dental procedures has been known for some time, having been applied shortly after the invention of the laser in 1960. In 1961, medical researchers treated animal and human retinas and showed that a laser beam could induce a lesion on the retina for therapeutic purposes. Such laser eye surgery for detached retinas and other disorders is now routine in eye clinics throughout the world. In this application, and in others using laser beams, the laser beam is absorbed by the irradiated tissue causing heating, denaturing of protein, and tissue death. The results are therapeutic because of the formation of scar tissue, cauterization of the bleeding blood vessels, or the cutting away of diseased or damaged tissue.Thus, in prior art applications of intense laser radiation, the laser was used to provide a directed source of the radiation whose thermal energy led to the pyrolysis of the organic matter. However, there are many situations where heating is not desired and is in fact harmful, and in those situations such lasers may not be used As will be more apparent from the following, the present invention is primarily applicable to a technique for using radiation in a manner in which unnecessary heating and damage to surrounding organic tissue is avoided. In the prior art, the intense laser radiation was generally in visible or infrared regions of the spectrum. For example, U. S. Patent 3,769,963 describes an instrument for performing laser micro surgery and describes the use of lasers for ophthalmology, dermatology, and experimental surgery. In this patent, a great deal of background information about laser treatments is provided, and the preferred wavelengths of light are stated to be 300 1000 rim although selective absorption of energy is noted in the range 200 3000 rim. In particular, selective absorption is noted in the visible range of 400 700 rim and in the infrared range at 1000 rim and 2000 rim. Laser treatment of skin defects and lesions is described in U. S. Patent 4,316,467 where a system is described for regulating the laser energy output in accordance with the absorption of the tissue being irradiated.Another reference describing lasers for medical and dental applications is U. S. Patent 3,821,510. This patent describes a flexible laser beam transmitting device which can be held by hand and has certain adjustment features.U. S. Patent 4,273,535 describes a method for preventing tooth decay using giant pulses produced from a laser having an output wavelength of 1.06 micrometers 1060 nm . In particular, a flexible glass fibre is used as a laser beam guide for directing the laser energy from the laser source to the area to be irradiated.In the prior art, the selectivity in absorption of different types of tissues has been noted, but the wavelengths used have been 200 nm and longer. To prevent irradiation and its consequent damage to nonselected areas surrounding the area selected for irradiation, it might be thought to use a mask. Even with such a mask, heating of the target area would be the primary mechanism for removal of organic matter. This means that surrounding areas would undergo some unavoidable heating and damage.It is one but not the exclusive object of this invention to provide for efficient removal of organic biological material without heating or thermal damage or pyrolysis or adverse effects to the areas of the material surrounding the area being irradiated. Disclosure of the InventionIn its broadest sense, this invention relates to the use of ultraviolet radiation of wavelengths less than 200 rim for medical and dental purposes, and more particularly for etching or eroding biological organic material. The organic material can be selectively removed without undue heating and damage to the areas surrounding the area which is struck by the radiation. The mechanism by which the organic material is removed, or etched, is different from that of the prior art, and the geometry of the etching pattern can be completely defined by the ultraviolet beam.In the technique of this invention, ultraviolet radiation of less than 200 rim wavelength has a very high efficiency for decomposing organic biological matter by electronic excitation of the constituent bonds of the organic matter, followed by bond breaking. The organic material is removed by ablative photodecomposition without heating or otherwise damaging the remaining organic material. This is initially a relatively linear photochemical effect, and inhomogeneities in the organic materials do not affect the photo etching.This technique is useful for many different types of uses and applications including surgical and dental applications. For example, damaged or unhealthy tissue can be removed from bones without damaging the bone itself and without traumatizing the remaining tissue. Also, skin lesions can be removed without traumatizing any of the surrounding skin. Healthy tissue can be cut or sectioned by the technique of this invention, without heating the edges of the cut. This also minimizes trauma. In addition to these exemplary types of applications, the invention can be used to treat decayed teeth, removing dental caries while leaving enamel and healthy dentine unaltered, in a possibly painless manner. The source of ultraviolet radiation can be any known source as long as the radiation is or includes one or more wavelengths in the range less than 200 rim and as long as ablative photodecomposition occurs. Pulsed radiation of energy fluence at least about 10 mJ cm2 pulse is preferable, but continuous radiation can also be used. A suitable ultra violet wavelength source is an ArF excimer laser providing a pulsed output at 193 rim. Such lasers are commercially available.The apprended claims cover a variety of subject matters. Claim 1 is directed to ablative photodecomposition apparatus. As regards the radiation, it can consist for example of one wavelength less than 200 nm, or a range of wavelengths less than 200 rim, or one or more wavelengths less than 200 rim, with one or more wavelengths greater than 200 nm. What matters for ablative photodecomposition is the energy fluence of the sub 200nm wavelength s .Claim 9 is directed to a source of W radiation of wavelength less than 200 rim and of sufficient energy fluence for use is causing ablative photodecomposition of a biological layer comprised of organic material.We believe that we are the first to discover ablative photodecomposition of organic biological material structural proteins of biological origin by UV radiation of sub 200 rim wavelength. Prior to the priority date of this application 2 Dec 82 , the known state of the art did not include, to our knowledge, the idea of applying W radiation of sub 200 rim wavelength for surgical or therapeutic purposes. Claim 14 is directed to a use of a substance or composition for treatment of a human or animal body by therapy, the substance or composition being excitable to produce the desired W radiation.In connection with claim 9 and 14 consideration has been given to C IV 4.2 of the Guidelines for Examination in the European Patent Office.Claim 17 is directed to use of a source as claimed in claim 9 for the treatment of a human or animal body by therapy. Its language is based on the question referred to the Enlarged Board of Appeal on T17 81, seeEPO Journal 7 1983 pages 266 268. Claim 18 is directed to a method, and is the subject of a disclaimer at the end of the claim, disclaiming from the scope of the claim methods for treatment of a human or animal body by surgery or therapy. Claim 19 is similar, and without the disclaimer, but specifies that the biological layer lacks human or animal life. Claim 20 is also similar but specifies that the layer is separated from a human or animal body.In support of these claims it will be apparent to the reader of this specification that the invention can be applied, for example, in post mortem examinations, and to non viable tissues separated from a human or animal body. The invention has been applied for example to a sample of dead avian muscle tissue separated from the deceased body. The expression used in the claims biological layer comprised of organic material is intended to have its normal broad scope based on the meaning of biology as the science of life. Brief Description of the DrawingsThe FIG. illustrates schematically one type of suitable apparatus for carrying out this invention. Best Mode for Carrying Out the InventionIn the practice of this invention, ultraviolet radiation of wavelengths less than 200 rim is used to selectively remove organic material.The radiation is applied either as pulsed radiation or as continuous wave radiation, and generally the pulsed radiation has a fluence greater 2 than 10 mJ cm pulse. Ultraviolet radiation in this wavelength range does not burn organic materials such as human tissue instead, it ablates the material, removing thin micrometer layers, layer by layer, for each pulse. In contrast, inorganic materials such as bone or tooth enamel are not photodecomposed by such radiation, at such energy densities.Ultraviolet radiation having wavelengths less than 200 rim is capable of decomposing the organic material by electronically exciting the constituent bonds of the material, followed by bond breaking and the production of volatile or gaseous materials which evaporate or escape from the surface. These photochemical reactions are particularly efficient for wavelengths less than 200 rim i.e., vacuum ultraviolet radiation . In ablative photodecomposition, the broken fragments of biological matter require a larger volume than the unbroken chemical chains and explode from the biological matter, carrying away kinetic energy. The only products may have a molecular weight less than 100.A suitable apparatus for carrying out the invention is shown in the FIG.It includes a source 10 of ultraviolet radiation of wavelengths less than 200 nm. A suitable source is an ArF excimer laser operating at a wavelength of 193 rim. Such lasers are commercially available and are made by, for example, Laabda Physik, W. Germany a subsidiary ofCoherent, Inc. . A specific laser with desirable properties for this application is the Lambda Physik EMG 150 with an output of about 200 mJ pulse, and a beam divergence of 200 microradians. These lasers routinely offer repetition rates of 60 100 pulses second at an energy 2 fluence greater than 200 millijoule cm pulse. The typical pulse duration is about 10 nsec.A casing 12 is used to contain the laser beam 14 indicated by the dashed lines . In a preferred embodiment, casing 12 is vented with nitrogen gas to remove oxygen from the beam path, since oxygen absorbs radiation of 193 rim wavelength.Casing 12 includes a shutter 16 which can be used to block the radiation beam, or allow it to pass. Also included within casing 12 is a 100 reflecting mirror 18, which is used to change the direction of the ultraviolet radiation 14. A lens 20 is optional, and can be used to focus the radiation beam onto a selected spot of the organic material 22. An aperture 24 is located in front of lens 20 to provide further collimation of the radiation before it strikes lens 20. Also, a mask 26 optionally can be located on or close to the organic material 22 in order to more fully define the incident ultra violet radiation.In an actual instrument, casing 12 could be part of a moveable arm having articulated joints so that the radiation beam could be moved about, the end piece of the instrument being held in the surgeons hand similarly to the holding of a scalpel. The instrument can also be moved relative to the patient, under the control of an alignment apparatus.For the exact design of a suitable flexible casing, reference is made to aforementioned U.S. Patent 3,769,963 which shows the use of an articulating arm and to aforementioned U.S. Patent 3,821,510 which also shows a flexible laser beam transmitting conduit that is capable of being held by hand In addition to these references, aforementioned U.S. Patent 4,316,467 describes a technique for regulating the output energy of the laser in accordance with the absorption of the incident radiation. If the apparatus is to be stationary, movement of the beam steering mirror 18 in the directions indicated by arrow 27, can be used to scan the radiation beam over a portion of the organic material to be etched.The following will detail some examples of the medical and dental applications of the technique of the present invention. In a first application, bone surgery, ultraviolet radiation of wavelengths less than 200 rim is used to clean organic tissue from bone. In such surgery, it is usual to cut or scrape tissue from bone with scissors or scalpel.This prior art technique can traumatize the nearby healthy tissue resulting in swelling and unnecessary bleeding. To avoid these problems, ultraviolet light of wavelengths less than 200 rim and sufficient energy to ablatively photodecompose the tissue is focussed on the tissue to remove the tissue with great precision, without undesirable thermal effects. The tissue can be removed down to the bone without damaging the bone. This is because these wavelengths do not affect materials such as bone, which are many fold less susceptible to ablative photoetching. Also, the inorganic bone surface is not affected 2 by the laser energy fluence levels 10 300 mJ cm pulse that effectively remove organic tissue. In order to illustrate the advance of the present technique with respect to that of the prior art using lasers providing different wavelengths, grooves were cut into a piece of cartilage attached to a bone using, alternatively, ArF laser radiation at 193 rim and laser radiation from a frequency doubled, pulsed Nd YAG laser. The ArF excimer laser 193 nm delivered pulses at approximately 100 mJ pulse at 10 pulses per second for approximately five seconds. This laser light was focussed with a cylindrical lens and irradiated a line approximately 30 mil long and 0.3 millimeter wide. The energy fluence was about 1000 mJ cm2 pulse.This radiation produced a groove approximately 150 micrometers deep, with sharp edges and a uniform depthThe frequency doubled Nd YAG laser delivered pulses at approximately 100 mJ pulse at ten pulses per second for approximately five seconds.The wavelength was 532 nm, in the green portion of the visible spectrum.This laser was also focussed with a cylindrical lens to an area comparable to that illuminated by the ArF laser. Thus, the energy fluences produced by the two lasers were comparable.In the case of the Nd YAG laser, the line which was produced in the cartilage was very burned, and was comprised of burned looking islands running approximately parallel to the clean groove which resulted from irradiation with the ArF laser. While the ArF laser at 193 rim cleanly removes cartilage, the frequency doubled Nd YAG laser charred the cartilage and produced raised carbonized islands. Far W radiation in the wavelength range below 200 rim causes the cartilage tissue to undergo linear photochemistry in the first step of this process, and material inhomogeneities in the organic tissue are unimportant. In contrast with this, the photochemical effects are very nonlinear when visible wavelengths are used and inhomogeneities in the organic tissue play an important role in determining where the charred islands occur.Another application of the technique and apparatus of this invention is the treatment of various skin defects. For example, port wine scars hemangiomas and other types of birthmarks can be selectively removed by a bloodless surgical procedure, using the present invention. Here, the far W light is used to carefully remove thin layers of skin without undesirable thermal side effects and without undue bleeding. For example, an ArF laser of the type shown can be used to excise skin cancer, remove port wine scars, and remove age spots. Another application is the treatment of a common form of skin cancer, termed basal cell carcinoma. This type of cancer is often caused by damage from short wavelength ultraviolet light between 280 315 rim, such as that produced by sunlight.This wavelength region of sunlight produces sunburn and burning of the basal cell layer located between the epidermis and the dermis, and can result in basal cell carcinoma. When basal cell layer burning occurs, sometimes local areas undergo uncontrolled growth, which is the carcinoma. Longer ultraviolet wavelengths, between 315 and 400 rim, cause pigment darkening or tanning in the epidermis. This mechanism helps to protect the basal cell layer from burning.A common technique for removing basal cell carcinoma involves scraping the skin at and around the lesion in order to take off layers of skin until all the malignant cells are removed. The dermatologist uses personal experience and feel as he scrapes the skin in layers, to determine when to stop scraping. In this procedure, the surrounding skin is often damaged and can become scarred in an unsightly manner over a larger area than is desirable.When far ultraviolet light surgery in accordance with the present invention is used, the carcinoma can be removed with a minimum of damage to healthy skin. The dermatologist uses the radiation beam to remove thin layers, layer by layer, and either uses his experience to determine when to stop, or uses some other chemical type of method. For example, the carcinoma may fluoresce differently than healthy skin under low level long wavelength ultraviolet radiation. Since the skin removal process by ultraviolet radiation of wavelengths less than 200 rim is clean i.e., no bleeding or scarring , it is easy to view the remaining tissue, unobscured by the roughened skin surface or by blood. This makes it easier to be able to tell when to stop removal of tissue.Another application is in the field of dental medicine. Far ultraviolet radiation of wavelengths less than 200 nm can be used to remove decay from teeth without damaging the surrounding enamel. As is known, teeth have an outside protective layer of calcium based enamel. Decay is caused by bacterial action of food particles, particularly those containing sugar. This bacterial action produces lactic acid, which enters pores and cracks in the enamel and destroys the enamel to reach the organic dentine. A decay action then continues into the interior of the tooth toward the nerve. In the prior art, decay is treated by removing all of the decayed dentine and enamel, and filling the cavity with amalgam, gold, or some other nontoxic durable filler. The tooth is cleaned out with a mechanical drill, and much healthy enamel and dentine is also removed.The friction from the drilling produces heat and can be quite painful.In contrast with this prior art technique, far ultraviolet radiation of wavelengths less than 200 nm can be used to ablatively remove decay. In this technique the ultraviolet beam is focussed upon the decayed area of the tooth and photoetches the decay matter, producing volatile products which escape. The enamel will not be damaged, and the decayed dentine will be selectively eroded with no undesirable thermal side effects.This treatment may be entirely painless and can be used to limit the amount of area that is photoetched to exactly the area containing the decay. The apparatus shown can be used as a drill to selectively cut away the decayed dentine without touching the enamel which is to remain. An additional use of this invention is in periodontal surgery. In this type of surgery, the gum tissue will be selectively eroded or cut, leaving the tooth enamel undamaged.Another application for this invention is in cutting or sectioning healthy organic tissue without damaging the edges of the cut. Since undamaged tissue edges heal more neatly and safely than ragged edges or scarred tissues, the chance of infection or the presence of an unsightly scar is reduced.In order to further demonstrate the degree of control over the etching process and the absence of heating effects, a sample of human hair was irradiated through a metal mask. Ablative photodecomposition of the hair was achieved by irradiating the human hair sample through a metal mask with 193 rim laser radiation. The energy fluence of the laser pulse 2 was 250 mJ cm pulse. The rate of removal of the hair material was approximately 400A per pulse, which is about three fold greater than the rates which have been realized when etching synthetic polymers with this radiation as described in our European application 83102552.3 .An enlarged view of the ablated material showed no evidence of thermal damage. In this irradiation, the hair was etched to controlled depths to provide rectangular grooves therein having sharply defined edges and uniform depth in each groove.In the practice of this invention, organic biological material can be photodecomposed in an ablative process that produces volatile products that escape. The ultraviolet radiation source can be any source providing radiation of wavelengths less than 200 rim. The threshold 2 energy flux for pulse radiation is about 10 mJ cm pulse. In this process, approximately 0.2 micrometers of organic tissue or other matter 2 are removed by each radiation pulse having at least 10 mJ cm pulse. The pulse width of the incident ultraviolet radiation is not critical to the process and, in fact, continuous radiation may also be used.The photodecomposition of the organic biological matter in this process is characterized by the absorption of a very large proportion approximately 95 of the incident photons in a thin less than 2700 A layer of the organic material, and by the breaking of a large number of protein bonds in the material with a high 10 100 quantum yield.Ejection of photolyzed material as small volatile molecules occurs into the surrounding atmosphere. These volatile or gaseous compounds typically have a low less than 100 molecular weight. The irradiated surface is photoetched in a pattern that is defined by the light.While it has been mentioned that both continuous wave radiation and pulsed radiation can be used in the practice of this invention, it may be that continuous wave radiation will be quite impractical. In the situation where continuous wave radiation is used, the bonds in the biological layer of organic matter may be broken but may recombine and deposit again if the process proceeds too slowly. Using a pulsed radiation source means that a large amount of energy can be delivered in a very small amount of time. When this occurs, the bonds are broken in the biological layer in a short amount of time, pressure is built up, and volatile products blow off. This is the mechanism of ablative photodecomposition APD , which requires that the broken fragments be produced in a small volume in a sufficiently short time that they blow off due to the pressure build up.The radiation source must provide this type of power density for ADP to occur.In the first step, the photochemistry is linear, the bonds being broken by the incident radiation. However, the blow off of volatile products is a nonlinear function of the rate at which the energy is introduced into the biological layer. In the example given previously, a minimum 2 energy flux of about 10 mJ cm pulse is sufficient to provide ablative photochemistry in which volatile products are blown off after the pulse which is about 10 nsec. wide is applied.The wavelength of the incident ultraviolet radiation is chosen to be less than 200 nm, and generally extends down to about 100 nm. In the spectroscopic art, this is termed the vacuum ultraviolet range, and generally comprises those wavelengths which begin to be absorbed in air.For example, oxygen begins to absorb radiation at about 200 nm, and this is why the apparatus shown is vented with nitrogen. As the wavelength decreases, more and more absorption will occur by different gases.Upon absorption of radiation in the wavelength range 100 200 nm, only a thin layer of the tissue is ablatively photodecomposed, and the radiation will not penetrate and damage other portions of the tissue.In contrast with this, longer wavelength radiation will produce burning and will not be characterized by ablative photodecomposition.In addition to the reasons described above for choosing the appropriate wavelength range, another practical reason exists with respect to the apparatus. It is known that lithium fluoride can be used as a transmission window located adjacent to the laser radiation source. Lithium fluoride has the shortest wavelength of transmission, and will cut off at approximately 110 rim. That is, at wavelengths shorter than 110 rim, the lithium flouride will not be transparent.Thus, for wavelengths less than 110 rim, a lithium fluoride window cannot be used, and the laser output would have to be passed through a vacuum chamber in order to prevent large amounts of absorption of the radiation. This would be a complex and costly apparatus. Also, no optical fibre is known which can transmit radiation at wavelengths less than 110 rim. Thus far, an ablative photodecomposition process has been described in which no heat effects are produced. That is, the photochemistry is such that the energy in the incident ultraviolet radiation is transmitted to the kinetic energy of the volatile products leaving the biological layer that is irradiated. The energy which is present in the ultraviolet beam is not transmitted as heat to the biological layer. This has been confirmed by measurements which look at the morphology of the material.Additionally, it is an effect which can be readily felt. As an example, a person can place his hand in the path of ultraviolet radiation having wavelengths less than 200 rim, and experience no pain. Only a small pressure is felt when the volatile gases are blown off, the pressure being a recoil when these gases blow off. While the ablative photodecomposition intended by the process of the present invention does not lead to a noticeable heat buildup in the biological layer, it is obvious that heat will begin to occur if more and more energy is applied. That is, when the amount of energy supplied is greater than the amount which can be carried away by the volatile byproducts, some heating will begin to occur.The minimum energy flux for producing ablative photodecomposition of 2 these biological layers is about 10 roj cm pulse, and the maximum energy for practical purposes is that which begins to cause detrimental heating and other effects similar to those which are seen when radiation of wavelengths greater than 200 rim is applied. This maximum amount of input energy flux depends upon the particular type of biological layer being photodecomposed in accordance with the present invention.Generally, it is desired that no significant amount of heating should occur in either the medical or dental applications of this invention.However, in its broadest sense the invention relates to ablative photodecomposition of biological layers at wavelengths less than 200 rim. For pulsed radiation, this effect begins to occur if the input energy 2 flux is at least about 10 mJ cm pulse. As a corollary to the fact that heat is not produced when the input energy flux is not unduly great, it has been noted that a pulsed beam of radiation from a YAG laser operating at the same power level will cause the sensation of pain to a human, while ultraviolet radiation at wavelengths less than 200 rim will not cause this sensation of pain. Of course, the reason is straightforward and is due to the difference between ablative photodecomposition in accordance with the present invention and decomposition resulting from a burning effect as is experienced in the prior art.Using ultraviolet radiation of wavelengths less than 200 rim has yielded ablative photodecomposition of biological matter without noticeable pyrolytic heat effects i.e., chemical changes induced by heat at 2 energy fluxes up to about 1000 mJ cm pulse, although this is not necessarily an upper limit. In the practice of this invention, any type of medical or dental application can be undertaken using ablative photodecomposition at wavelengths less than 200 rim. While the invention has been particularly described with respect to certain embodiments and applications, it will be readily apparent to those of skill in the art that other applications can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Further, the exact apparatus for transmitting the ultraviolet radiation to the organic matter to be photodecomposed can be varied by those of skill in the art, without departing from the spirit and scope of this invention.
