## Description
Clavulanic Acid Derivatives, Prearation and UseThe present invention relates to a process for the preparation of derivatives of clavulanic acid.Belgian Patent No 847045 discloses that esters of ethers of clavulanic acid which are ss lactamase inhibitors and antibacterial agents may be prepared by the etherification of esters of clavulanic acid. We have now found that epoxides may be used in a convenient synthesis to prepare certain such compounds and the corresponding free acids and salts.Accordingly the present invention provides a process for the preparation of the compounds of the formula I EMI1.1 and salts and esters thereof, Wherein R1 is a hydrogen atom, a lower alkyl group, a lower alkenyl group, a phenyl group or a phenyl lower alkyl group and R2 is a hydrogen atom, a lower alkyl group, or a CH20R3 group whereR is a hydrogen atom, a lower alkyl group, a phenyl group, a phenyl lower alkyl group or a lower acryl group, or R i joined to Rê to for tho residue of a 5 7 membered aturated carbocyclic ring which process comprises the eaction of an ter of clavulanic acid with a compound f the formula II EMI2.1 wherein RÚ and Rê are as defined in relation to formula I , and thereafter, if desired, de esterifying the thusproduced ester to form the free acid oh a salt.When used herein the term lower means the group contains up to carbon atoms and more suitably up to 3 carbon atoms. la a hydrogen atom. Most suitably Rê is a hydrogen atom. Preferably R1 and Rê are both hydrogen atoms so that a particularly favoured process according to this invention comprises the preparationof an ester of 9 0 2 hydroxyethyl clavulanic acid which process comprises the reaction of the orresponding ester of clavulanic acid with ethylene oxide.When used herein the term ester includes esters notiorally derived from an alcohol of the formula ROH where R i an or enic recidue. Suitable groups R include alkyl, alkenyl, alkyhyl, aryl, arylalkyl or other similar groups any of which may be substituted if desired. In order not to increase the molecular weig to an unreasonable extent, group R do not normally include more than 16 carbon atoms, moe suitably, not more than 12 carbon atoms and most suitably, not more than S carbon atoms. Preferably, the group R is notionally derived fron an alcohol ROH which is pharmaceutically acceptable. Cuitable subs tituents which may be included in the group R include halogen atoms and lower alkoxyl, hydroxyl, lower acyloxy and like groups. With reference to esterifying groups, the term lower means that the group contains up to 6 carbon atoms, and preferably up to 4 carbon atoms.Thus, for example, R may be a methyl, ethyl, n propyl, iso propyl, straight or branched butyl, pentyl, butyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl, undecyl, dodecyl, vinyl, allyl, butenyl, cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl, cyclohexenyl, cyclohexadienyl, methylcyclopentyl, methylcyclohexyl, benzyl, benzylhydryl, phenylethyl, naphthylmethyl, phenyl, naphthyl, propynyl, toll, 2 chloroethyl, 2,2,2 trichloroethyl, 2,2,2 trifluoroethyl, acetylmethyl, benzoylmethyl, 2 methoxyethyl, p bromobenzyl, m chlorobenzyl, 6 methoxynaphthyl 2 methyl, p chlorophenyl, p methoxyphenyl or any like group as well as those groups which are known from the penicillin or cephalosporin arts t produce esters known to be readily hydrolysed in vivo to the parent compound. Readily hydrolysable esterifying groups include, but are not limited to, those of the sub formulae a and b EMI4.1 wherein A1 is a hydrogen atom or an alkyl, aryl or aralkyl group A2 is a hydrogen atom or methyl group A is an alkyl, aryl or aralkyl group X is oxygen or sulphur Y is oxygen or sulphur and Z is a divalent organic group.Preferred groups of the sub formulae a and b include those wherein a1 is a hydrogen atom, A2 is a hydrogen atom or a nethyl group and A is a methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, benzyl or phenyl group and those wherein X is oxygen, Y is oxygen and Z is H2CH2 , CH CH ,EMI4.2 When used in conjunction with the preceding formulae, the term alkyl includes alkyl of up to six carbon atoms the term aryl includes phenyl, naphthyl or phenyl substituted by an inert substituent such as a fluorine or chlorine atom or a methyl or methoxyl group or the like when used herein the term aralkyl means an alkyl group substituted by an aryl group. Particularly suitable groups of the sub formulae a and b include those of the sub formulae c and d EMI4.3 EMI5.1 where A4 is a hydrogen atom or a methyl group, A5 is a methyl, t butyl or phenyl group and A6 is a hydrogen atom or a methoxyl group. Esters which undergo some hydrolysis under mild conditions include those where the esterifying group is a group R4 wherein R4 is a hydrocarbon group of 1 9 carbon atoms optionally substituted by halogen, lower alkoxy or hydroxyl. When used with reference to the group R4 the term lower means that the group contains 1 4 carbon atoms. Suitable groups R4 include alkyl or aralkyl groups optionally substituted by halogen, methoxyl or hydroxyl. More suitably alkyl groups R4 are straight chain groups of up to 6 carbon atoms optionally substituted by one methoxy or hydroxyl group, or one chlorine, bromine or iodine atom or by a CCl 3 or F5 group. A particularly suitable hydrolysable ester is the methoxymethyl ester A further group of particularly suitable ester of this invention are those useful intermediates which are eadily converted to the free acid or a salt thereof by chemical Ci, biochemical techniques which are known from the penicillin or cephalosporin arts to be sufficiently mild not to degrade reactive acid labile ss lactam rings. Most suitably, the ester ie one removable by hydrogenolysis. Conventional esters for such a process include those rein the esterifying group is a group herein R5 is a hydrogen atom or an optionally r.ubstitued phenyl group and R6 is an optionally substituted phenyl group. Most suitably R5 is a hydrogen atom or a phenyl, tolyl, chlorophenyl or methoxyphenyl group and R6 is a phenyl, tolyl, chlorophenyl or methoxyphenyl group. Preferably R5 is a hydrogen atom and R6 is a phenyl group. By and lange, the nature of any substituent in the ester moiety is unimportant as long as it does not interfere with the hydrogenolysis reaction. The etherification is generally carried out in the presence of a catalyst such as boron trifluoride for example as the therate or its chemical equivalent. The reaction may be carried out at any convenient non extreme temper ature but in general a depressed temperature for example 1000 to 410 C is most suitable. The reaction normally employs an organic solvent such as halohydrocarbon, for example dichloromethane or chloroform , an ether for example tetrahydrofuran , and ester for example ethyl acetate or the lie. The solvent is normally strictly nor hyoroxylic. Suitak methods of de esterifiestion include there desoribed in British Patent No 1508977, Application Nos 41897 75 02629 76 19000 76, 51808 76 and 11116 76, Belgian Patents Nos 827926 and 847045 and or U.S. Serial No 786345. Such methods include mild base hydrolysis e.g. at pH 8 .5 of lower alkyl or lower alkoxyalkyl esters and hydrogenolysis of benzyl and substituted benzyl esters. Hydrogenolysis of benzyl or substituted benzyl esters will normally be effected in the presence of a transition metal catalyst, for example, palladium on charcoal, in an inert solvent, such as tetrahydrofuran, optionally containing water. Qen a base is present during the hydrogenolysis a salt of the compound of the formula I is produced.Alternatively, the hydrogenolysis may be performed in the absence of a base, and the resultant acid subsesuently treated with a base to form a salt. Suitable bases include sodium and potassium bi carbonate, calcium and magnesium carbonate, and the like. ost suitably, the de esterification aspect of the process comprises the preparation of 9 0 2 hydroxyethyl clavulanic acid or a salt thereof by the de esterification of an ester of 0 2 hydroxyethyl clavulanic acid formed by the reaction of an ester of clavulanic acid with ethylene oxide. This invention also provides the compounds of the formula I and salts ano esters thereof when prepared by the process of this invention. The compounds of the formula I and their salts and esters are ss lactamase inhibitors, and may be formulated for use in creating bacterial infections as described in Belgian Patent No 847045.
