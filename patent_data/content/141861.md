# CATALYTIC COMBUSTION APPARATUS.

## Abstract
A catalytic combustion apparatus is provided with a catalyst 39, 66, 83, 93 which causes an oxidation reaction between a vaporized fuel gas and air, and an ignition heater 14, 67, 86 which is used to start the oxidation reaction that takes place in the presence of the catalyst. The catalytic com bustion apparatus is also provided with a first member 30, 62, 72, 78 of a pipe shape which supports the catalyst 39, 66, 83, 93 and supplies it with the vaporized fuel gas, and a second member 31, 63, 73, 79 which is arranged within the first member, and one end thereof is secured to the first member. The first member and second members in combination con stitute a heat responsive element, and the gas flow rate is also regulated by making use of the differences in thermal expan sion of the first and second members.
