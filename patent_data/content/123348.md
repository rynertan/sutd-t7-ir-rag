## Abstract
A display apparatus which comprises a display tube 10 having a channel plate electron multiplier 38 and a penetron screen 40 with an electrode 42 thereinafter termed the screen electrode thereon by which an accelerating field is provided between the electron multiplier and the screen. In order to obtain rapid switching of the voltage applied to the screen electrode 42 , an EHT power supply has a ther mionic valve 70 included within the display tube envelope 20 to shunt current to ground when switching from a high voltage to a low voltage. The anode 72 and cathode 76 of the valve 70 are connected respectively to the screen elec trode 42 and the electron gun cathode 28 . The valve 70 may be a triode or tetrode. A feedback arrangement is dis closed which enables the voltage on the screen electrode 42 to remain substantially constant in spite of variations in screen current. Figure 1 illiustrated shows an electromagneti cally deflected display tube and Figure 2 not shown shows an embodiment of an apparatus having a flat, electrostatically deflected, display tube.
