# Method and apparatus for generating power and low pressure saturated or near saturated steam.

## Abstract
Low pressure steam leaving a turbine 108 is used to preheat a major part of the feed water to a boiler 107 to a higher temperature than the balance of the feed water. The preheated part of the feed water is then introduced into the boiler 107 at a higher temperature zone than the remainder of the feed water.
