# Hydraulic air compressor.

## Abstract
Use is made of a descending column of water to compress air entrained with the water. The water can be fed to an air inclusion chamber at the head of a down pipe from a source of stored water, such as a dam, or can be recycled by means of a pump. The water is fed tangentially to the air inclusion chamber which has a conical shape. As a result of the tangential entry of the water, it is caused to swirl with a vortical motion. In addition, the water stream is in turbulent flow. A venturi effect is created at the narrow throat section of the air inclusion chamber. A combination of these factors serves to enhance the entrainment of air. The inertia of the water as it leaves the orifice, or nozzle, and swirls into the venturi throat enables the inertia of the water in the down pipe to be overcome at the same time providing a blocking mechanism to prevent air rising into the air inclusion chamber. At the bottom end of the down pipe, the compressed air is separated from the water, and the water is returned to a surge tank in which the pump is mounted, the pump is only used if the source of water is unable to supplv water under sufficient head to the air inclusion chamber
