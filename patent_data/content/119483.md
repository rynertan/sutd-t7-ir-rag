# System and method for detecting driver drowsiness of a vehicle.

## Abstract
A system and method for detecting driver drowsiness on the basis of steering pulses, each steering pulse being produced whenever a steering pulse is rotated through a predetermined angle and indicating the direction of rotation of the steering wheel, comprising means for detecting the roughness of the road surface on which the vehicle is travelling and interrupting the detection of driver drowsi ness for a fixed interval of time when the road surface roughness exceeds an acceptable level, i.e. a level conduc tive to accurate drowsiness detection.
