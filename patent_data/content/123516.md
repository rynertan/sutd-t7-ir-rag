# Electrochemical cell.

## Abstract
A solid state electrochemical cell comprises an anode having lithium as its active material, a polymeric electrolyte, and a cathode comprising a composite of an insertion elec trode material or similarly active material and a polymeric material. One of the electrolyte and the cathode possesses an ioni cally conducting phase at ambient temperature and the other of the electrolyte and the cathode lacks such a phase. Ionic conductivity can be induced in said other of the electrolyte and cathode at elevated temperature thereby to render the cell operable and give rise to improvements in comparison with cells where such phases are present ab initio.
