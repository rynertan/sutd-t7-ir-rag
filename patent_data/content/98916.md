# DISPENSING CONTAINER FOR AN EVAPORATIVE AIR FRESHENER

## Abstract
A dispensing container has a bottom wall, an enclosed side wall, an elongated protusion formed in the side wall, an elongated recess formed in the side wall substantially opposite said protusion, a top wall and an outlet formed in the top wall and in this top wall a sloped portion is integrated which slopes downwardly and outwardly from the outlet. During the use of this container in an inverted position above and close to a reservoir the sloped portion accelerates an air flow which is forced through the gap between the container and the reservoir. This acceleration of the air flow leads to a higher evaporation effect due to the reduced pressure in this area. In this way a liquid material may be used which is less sensitive to temperatures and humidity as to its volativity.
