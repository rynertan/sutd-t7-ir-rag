# Gasoline compositions for automotive vehicles.

## Abstract
A motor gasoline composition for use in automotive vehicles is disclosed. A gasoline fraction having an aromatics content of greater than 35 volume and a 50 distillation temperature of 85 to 125 C is combined with 0.1 to 1.0 weight based on the gasoline fraction of a selected alkaline earth metal salt, whereby plug fouling inhibiting ability is greatly improved.
