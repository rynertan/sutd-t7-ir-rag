# A vacuum cleaner tool for use on horizontal and vertical surfaces.

## Abstract
A vacuum cleaner tool 1 , for use with a vacuum cleaner, comprises a housing 3 having an opening 33 in one surface 9 thereof through which air and dirt is drawn and, when the floor tool is being used to vacuum a surface, the opening 33 faces this surface. A swivel mechanism 13 couples the tool 1 to a vacuum cleaner coupling device 11 and permits the tool 1 to be rotated about the axis A A of the swivel mechanism 13 . The plane of the opening is oriented at 45 C with respect to the axis A A of the swivel mechanism 13 . Thus, when the tool 1 is rotated 180 about the axis A A of the swivel mechanism 13 , the orientation of the plane of the opening 33 is rotated 90 with respect to its initial position.
