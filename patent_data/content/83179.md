# A system for removing incendiary matter from the interior of an aircraft.

## Abstract
The device utilizes the differential in pressure between the pressurized interior of a modern aircraft and the external airstream at the elevations at which the aircraft is being operated. The device itself comprises a main intake nozzle 10 , an intermediate wand portion 20 which is connected to the intake nozzle and in fluid communication therewith and a flexible hose 30 provided with a quick connect fitting 50 for connecting the device to a suitable outlet fitting 60 in the skin of the aircraft. Preferably, several such outlet fittings are provided so that the device can be utilized at different locations within the aircraft s interior without requiring an excessively long hose. Each of the outlets is normally closed by means of a disk shaped plug 100 held in a flush position with respect to the aircraft s outer surface. The plug itself is provided with an ejecting mechanism which may be a pyrotechnic fuse. The device may be equipped with a balanced flow regulator 40 .
