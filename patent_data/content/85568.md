# Document feed in device for typing machine.

## Abstract
A document feed in device for an electronic typewriter comprises a lower guide member 13 for guiding the document towards a typing line on the platen 12 and a plate or bar member 77 for guiding the document immediately beyond the typing line. The plate or bar member is carried by two movable levers 23, 24 spanned by a bail bar 22 for moving that member away from the platen and at the same time actuating a switch 51 for signalling the presence of the document to the electronic control means of the machine, to cause rotation of the platen so that the document 54 goes beyond the typing line by a predetermined distance such that the top edge of the document is moved into a region in which it is engaged by the plate or bar member when the bail bar 22 is returned to permit typing in a region immediately adjacent to the top edge of the document.
