In conducting a reaction, when the compound expressed by the formula III is liquid under the reaction temperature, the compound expressed by the formula Eli may be allowed to react with the compound expressed by the formula Elil without the use of a solvent however, the reaction is generally conducted in the presence of an appropriate solvent.As for such solvents, any solvent may be used unless it interferes with the reaction. To speak of appropriate solvents, for instance, such alcohols as ethanol, n propanol, isopropanol, n butanol, etc., such aromatic hydrocarbons as benzene, toluene etc., such ethers as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, etc., acetonitrile, N,N dimethylformamide, etc. may be mentioned as readily obtainable ones. These reaction solvents may be used as a mixed solvent consisting of two or more solvents. The reaction temperature is in general appropriately selected from the range of 500C to the boiling point of the reaction system. The reaction time varies depending upon the material compounds, scale of the reaction, reaction solvents, reaction temperature, etc. however, it is usually in the range of 30 minutes to 48 hours. The reaction can also be conducted in the presence of a base such as sodium hydrogencarbonate, potassium hydrogencarbonate, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, etc. In the present invention, tetrahydronaphthoimidazoline 2 thion and its derivatives can be prepared by reacting reaction A l,2 diamino l,2,3,4 tetrahydronaphthalene or its derivative with carbon disulfide, followed by a reaction reaction B to remove hydrogen sulfide. In the reaction A mentioned above, it is preferable to use 1 to 1.3 moles of carbon disulfide against 1 mole of 1,2 diamino 1,2,3,4 tetrahydro naphthalene and its derivatives. This reaction is generally conducted in the presence of an appropriate solvent. As for such solvents, any solvent may be used unless it interferes with the reaction. To speak of appropriate solvents, for instance, such alcohols as methanol, ethanol, n propanol, isopropanol, n butanol, etc., such lower carboxylic acid ester as ethyl acetate, etc., such halogenated hydrocarbon as methylene chloride, chloroform, 1,2 dichloroethane, etc., such aromatic hydrocarbons as benzene, toluene, etc., such ethers as ether, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, etc., may be mentioned. These reaction solvents may be used as a mixed solvent consisting of two or more solvents.In case when the solvent is mixed uniformly with water, the solvent can be used in the reaction system in which water is contained in an amount not to break the uniformity. The optimum reaction temperature varies depending upon the used reaction solvent however, the appropriate reaction temperature may usually be selected from the range of 100C to the boiling point of the system. The reaction time varies depending upon the material compounds, scale of the reaction, reaction solvents, reaction temperature, etc. however, it is usually in the range of 10 minutes to 48 hours. The compounds obtained from the reaction A are adducts of 1, 2 diamino l, 2,3 ,4 tetrahydronaphthalene or its derivative and carbon disulfide. In some cases, the solubility of these compounds is lower than that of the material compounds depending upon the used reaction solvent and, as the reaction goes on, they tend to leave the reaction system and deposit in the form of a solid. They can, therefore, be isolated by filtration in such a case. The isolation can also be effected by evaporating and solidifying the reaction mixture. The adduct of 1,2 diamino l,2,3,4 tetrahydronaphthalene or its derivative and carbon disulfide has enough purity to be subjected to the next reaction to remove hydrogen sulfide reaction B . The reaction B is usually conducted with the use of an appropriate reaction solvent while heating.As for such solvents, any solvent may be used unless it interferes with the reaction. To offer some examples of appropriate solvents, such alcohols as methanol, ethanol, n propanol, isopropanol, nbutanol, etc., a mixture of any of these alcohols and water, such haloganated hydrocarbon as chloroform, 1,2 dichloroethane, etc. may be mentioned. The optimum reaction temperature varies depending upon the used reaction solvent the appropriate reaction temperature may ordinarily be selected fro the range of 500C to the boiling point of the system. The reaction time varies depending upon the material compounds used in the reaction A, scale of the reaction, reaction solvent, and reaction temperature however, it is usually in the range of about 10 minutes to 24 hours. The separation and purification of tetrahydronaphthoimidazoline 2 thion and its derivatives, which are expressed by said formula Eli and obtained in the reaction B, from the reaction mixture can be effected by means of an ordinary operation such as filtration, recrystallization, chromatography, etc. As for the reaction procedures for the reaction A and the reaction B, the adducts formed in the reaction A may be subjected to the reaction to remove hydrogen sulfide after their isolation the reaction B may be conducted in succession to the reaction A without effecting the isolation of the adduct or the reaction conditions under which the reaction B is conducted may be adopted while the reaction A is still going on, in which way the reaction A and the reaction B are substantially effected just as a single reaction instead of being carried on separately l,2 Diamino l ,2,3 ,4 tetrahydronaphthalene and its derivatives which are expressed by said formula EIV and are used as the material compounds in the process according to the present invention, can be prepared by various methods.To give examples of such methods, they can be prepared from 2 halo 3,4 dihydro 1 2H naphthalenon and its derivatives which are readily obtained from 3,4 dihydro 1 2H naphthalenon and its derivatives after the method published by Koptyung et al. in the Zhurnal Obshchei Khimii,Vol. 32, p.1613 1962 and they can also be prepared from 1,2 dihydronaphthalene and its derivatives, which are derived from 3,4 dihydro 1 2H naphthalenon and its derivatives, after the method published by Swift et al. in the Journal of Organic Chemistry, Vol. 32, p.511 1967 .

Cunningham and A. Czenberg see the Immunology, Vol.14, pp599 600, 1969 . For purposes of comparison, experiments were also conducted with the mice which were not administered with the drugs and with those which were administered with publicly known levamisole in the place of the drugs according to the present invention. The results of these experiments are shown in Table 1 in which the results obtained with the ICR mice are given in Experiment la and those obtained with the CDF1 mice are given in Experiment lb.Experiment 2 C311He mice male, 17 weeks old were administered intravenously with 5 x 105 sheep red blood cells as antigen and 24 hours after the administration of antigen, the respective drugs were administered hypodermically in the inquinal region of the mice. 4 days after the aministration of antigen, antibody forming cells in the spleens of the mice were assayed according to the same method as adopted in Experiment l. As was in the case of Experimentl, the experiment without the use of the drugs and the experiment with the use of levamisole were also conducted for purposes of comparison.

Lagrange, G.B. Mackaness and T.E. Mille in the Journal of Experimental Medicine, Vol. 139, pp 1529 1539, 1974 . 108 Sheep red blood cells suspended in 0.05 ml of saline buffered with phosphate were injected hypodermically into the hind footpad of ICR mice male, 12 weeks old and then the mice were administered intraperitoneally with the drugs. Four days after the administration of the drugs, 108 sheep red blood cells were injected hypo dermically into the hind footpad opposite to the one which was previously administered with antigen. 24 hours after the injection, the thickness of the hind footpad was measured with a dial thickness meter Gl type, manufactured by Ozaki Seisakusho to dermine the increase in thickness as compared with the uninjected hind footpad. For purposes of comparison, experiments were conducted with the mice which were not given the drugs and with those which were administered with levamisole instead of the drugs of the present invention. The results of these experiments are shown in Table 2.

Industrial Application Since hexahydronaphthoimidazothiazole and its derivatives have an excellent function of activating immunization or of controlling immunization, they have expected applications as a cancer remedy for immunization therapy or as a remedy for such auto immunogenic diseases as rheumatic arthritis, etc. Also these compounds can be used as an anthelmintic for animals.Tetrahydronaphthoimidazoline 2 thion and its derivatives obtained according to the present invention are useful compounds as intermediary syntheses of hexahydronaphthoimidazothiazole.
