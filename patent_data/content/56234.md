## Description
Endoscope The present invention relates to an endoscope provided with a suction changeover means. Generally, the endoscope has a suction path through which dirt and mucus in the body cavity are sucked, and a suction changeover means arranged at the endoscope operating section to selectively communicate and shut the suction path. One of conventional suction changeover means has a cylinder arranged on the way of suction path and opened outside atmosphere at one end thereof. In the case of endoscope provided with such suction changeover means, negative pressure acts on the suction path so as to allow suction in the body cavity to be achieved only when the opening of cylinder is closed by a finger. However, the suction path is usually communicated with atmosphere in this case and gas is therefore allowed to escape outside the body through the suction path when it is necessary that gas is fed into the body cavity to expand the body cavity ready for observation and treatment.Another measure is to arrange a piston in this cylinder and only when this piston is pushed by a finger, the suction path is communicated with a suction source through a communicating path provided in the piston. However, this makes the endoscope complicate in construction and difficult to manufacture with the problem of increasing the number of parts needed. The present invention is intended to eliminate these drawbacks and the object of the present invention is therefore to provide an endoscope simple in construction and capable of allowing gas in the body cavity to be discharged only when pressure in the body cavity becomes higher than a predetermined value and being easily cleaned and cleanly used. This invention can be more fully understood from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 shows one embodiment of an endoscope according to the present invention in which a suction changeover means is under an operation Fig. 2 is a sectional view showing the endoscope shown in Fig. 1 in which the suction changeover means is under another operation Fig. 3 schematically shows another embodiment of an endoscope according to the present invention and Figs. 4 and 5 are sectional views showing variations of suction changeover means. A first embodiment of the present invention will be now described with reference to Figs. 1 and 2.Reference numeral 1 represents an operating section of an endoscope where are arranged an ocular optical system 2, an angle operating knob not shown and the like. An elongated insertion section 3 inserted into the body cavity is attached at the base end thereof to the operating section 1. An image guide, a light guide, an air supply pipe not shown and a suction path 4 are inserted through the insertion section 3. One end of suction path 4 is opened at the side wall of a cylinder which will be described later while the other end thereof at the end face of foremost end 3a of insertion section 3. A suction changeover means or mechanism 5 is arranged at the operating section 1 as be now described.A cylinder 6 is fixed at the operating section 1. One end of cylinder 6 is opened outside as a pressure discharging opening 6a and the other end thereof serves as a connecting opening 6b to which a suction pipe 7 is connected. To the suction pipe 7 is freely detachably connected a suction source or vacuum pump P, for example.Around the circumference of pressure discharging opening 6a is formed a collar 8 for stopping a cylindrical valve 6. One end of suction path 4 is opened as an opening 4a at the side wall of cylinder 6. The cylindrical valve 10 is fitted into the cylinder 6. The cylindrical valve 10 has an outer diameter substantially same as the inner diameter of cylinder 6, and a body 10a whose both ends are opened and which is made of resilient material such as rubber and synthetic resin. The outer surface of the body 10a closely contacts with the inner surface of cylinder 6 and resiliently closes the opening 4a of suction path 4 by one end outer surface thereof to shut the communication between the suction path 4 and the suction pipe 7. Around the circumference of opened upper end of body 10a is formed a recess opened underside and having an L shaped cross section. A stopper collar portion 11 is formed integral to the recess and engaged with the collar fitting portion 8 when the collar fitting portion 8 is fitted in the recess.A finger portion 12 is projected horizontally from a part of stopper collar portion 11. When the finger portion 12 is lifted holding it by fingers to take off the stopper collar portion 11 from the collar fitting portion 8, therefore, the cylindrical valve 10 can be easily detached from the cylinder 6. The suction changeover means thus arranged leaves the suction pipe 7 communicated with outside atmosphere through the pressure discharging opening 6a when the pressure discharging opening 6a is not closed by finger.Therefore, no negative pressure caused by the suction source P acts on the suction path 4, thus preventing suction in the body cavity from being carried out.When the pressure discharging opening 6a is closed by finger as shown in Fig. 2, that part of cylindrical valve 10 which faces the opening 4a is resiliently pushed by the pressure difference caused at the opening 4a and the connecting opening 6b thanks to negative pressure in the suction pipe 7, so that the suction path 4 is communicated with the suction pipe 7. Dirt, mucus, cleaning water and the like in the body cavity can be therefore sucked through the suction path 4 and collected into a collecting bottle or the like through the suction pipe 7. In the case where gas such as air is fed to expand the body cavity ready for observation and treatment, a gas supply means not shown belonging to the endoscope is rendered operative to feed gas under pressure into the body cavity through a gas supply pipe. Since the opening 4a of suction path 4 is resiliently closed by the cylindrical valve 10, gas in the body cavity is prevented from leaking out. However, when pressure in the body cavity abnormally becomes high, the cylindrical valve 10 is automatically pushed, thus allowing gas in the body cavity to be discharged. Abnormal expansion of body cavity can be therefore prevented keeping the patient safe and free from pain. According to the embodiment of the present invention is provided the suction changeover means as described above and comprising the combination of simple shaped cylinder 6 having the pressure discharging opening 6a, and cylindrical valve 10 made of resilient material. This suction changeover means is simple in construction and easy to manufacture and can prevent gas in the body cavity from leaking out. In addition, the cylindrical valve 10 can be easily detached from the cylinder 6 when the stopper collar portion 11 is taken off from the collar fitting portion 8. These simple cylinder shaped valve 10 and cylinder 6 allow therefore their cleaning to be easily carried out ready for a subsequent clean use. Fig. 3 shows a second embodiment of the present invention in which the suction path 4 is divided on the way thereof to form a branched path 4b having an opening 15 at the foremost end thereof. This second embodiment allows treatment tools such as biopsy forceps to be inserted into the body cavity through the opening 15, branched path 4b and suction path 4. An airtight packing 16 is arranged in the branched path 4b adjacent to the opening 15 thereof. As shown in Fig. 3, the packing 16 fluidly separates the opening 15 from the suction path 4 but allows treatment tools to be inserted into the branched path. Other arrangement of this second embodiment is same as that of first embodiment and same parts as those in the first embodiment are therefore represented by same reference numerals and description on these parts will be omitted. That portion of cylindrical valve which serves to open and close the opening 4a of suction path may be formed thinner to be easily resiliently deformed. The body 10a of cylindrical valve 10 is formed to have a uniform thickness as a whole, but that portion thereof which faces the opening 4a may be made thinner as shown in Fig. 4 to achieve easy resilient deformation. That portion of body 10a which serves to perform valve function may be made as a member different from the other portion. A variation of suction changeover means will be now described referring to Fig. 5. Those parts which achieve same functions as those in above mentioned embodiments will be represented by same reference numerals and description on those parts will be omitted. The cylinder 6 has at the lower end thereof an opening portion 4a to which a suction path 4 is connected, and at the circumferential wall a connecting opening 6b to which a suction pipe 7 is connected. The cylindrical body 10a of valve 10 includes a bottom wall and a circumferential wall, which are formed integral to each other and made of resilient material such as synthetic resin. The bottom wall of cylindrical body 10a is formed so as to close the opening portion 4a and at the circumferential wall thereof is formed a hole for communicating the through hole of cylindrical body 10a with the connecting opening 6b. When the suction changeover means thus arranged is under the condition shown in Fig. 5, the suction pipe 7 is communicated with atmosphere through the connecting opening 6b, through hole of cylinderical body 10a and pressure discharging opening 6a, so that no suction function is achieved. When the pressure discharging opening 6a is closed by finger to shut the through hole of cylindrical body 10a from atmosphere, that portion of bottom wall of cylindrical body 10a which is adjacent to the connecting opening is drawn and deformed toward the connecting opening thanks to negative pressure caused at the connecting opening, so that the interception between the connecting opening 7 and the opening portion 4a is released. This enables same suction function as in above mentioned embodiments to be achieved through the suction path. As described above, the endoscope of the present invention includes the valve and cylinder arranged in such a way that the valve is fitted into the cylinder and the opening to the suction path is closed from inside using the resilient force of cylindrical valve.The endoscope is therefore simple in construction, small in number of parts needed and easy to manufacture. In addition, when pressure in the body cavity increases abnormally, the suction changeover means also functions as a safe valve to discharge said abnormally increased pressure and gas supply to the body cavity can be therefore achieved safely. Further, since the cylindrical valve can be detached from the cylinder, these members can be easily cleaned and used cleanly, thus achieving high practical effect.
