# SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICE COMPRISING A FIELD EFFECT TRANSISTOR

## Abstract
A semiconductor device comprising a semiconductor body 1 includes a field effect transistor and an active transistor region with two electrode zones 4, 5 one of which 5 surrounds the other 4 , and an island zone 6 which is situated therebetween. These zones enclose channel regions 7, 8 over which there are provided gate electrodes 9, 10 , the first one 9 of which surrounds the second one 10 . The gate electrodes are connected to bond pads 11, 12 present outside the active transistor region. The first gate electrode 9 is interrupted at the area of the connection from the second gate electrode 10 to a bond pad 12 , both its ends 20, 21 being connected to another bond pad 11 . Even at very high frequencies, the transistor exhibits a high gain, a high transconductance and a low input attenuation.
