# Multiple speed sprocket and activating device.

## Abstract
A novel combination of an adjustable sprocket wheel 1,2 and transmission mechanism enables the bicyclist to convert his energy as optimum as possible into motion. An important detail is that one of the pedal supporting cranks is connected with both the toothed segments 1,2 of the sprocket wheel in pivots 11,12 situated as close as possible in the proximity of the nominal diameter of the sprocket wheel. Both toothed segments 1,2 are interconnected by means of lever systems 14,15 with to the outside end a fixed pivot 16,17 onto the one segment and to the other end a pin 18 which is movable in various positions in an adjustment groove 19 of the other segment.
