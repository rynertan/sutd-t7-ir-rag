# Rear projection screen.

## Abstract
In a rear projection screen, a pair of light refracting plates 11, 12 oppose each other. A plurality of first convex lens elements 13 are arranged parallel to each other on one surface of the plate 11 , and a plurality of second convex lens elements 14 are arranged parallel to each other on the other surface of the plates 11 . Similarly, a plurality of first convex lens elements 16 are arranged parallel to each other on one surface of the plate 12 , and a plurality of second convex lens elements 17 are arranged parallel to each other on the other surface of the plate 12 . Each pair of opposed first and second elements 13, 14, 16, 17 is located along a common optical axis thereof. A convex surface 13A, 16A of each first element 13, 16 is located at a focal plane of the corresponding second element 14, 17 . A convex surface 14A, 17 A of each second element 14, 17 is located on a focal plane of the corresponding first element 13, 16 . A longitudinal axis of the first and second elements 13, 14 of one of the plates 11 is perpendicular to that of the first and second elements 16, 17 of the other one of the plates 12 .
