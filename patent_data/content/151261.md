# Polyphenylene ether resin blends reinforced with finely divided particulate clay of narrow size distribution.

## Abstract
Blends of a polyphenylene ether resin, optionally con taining an impact modifier, are filled with finely divided particulate clay which is characterized by a very narrow size distribution, 98 percent or more of the particles being less than 2 microns in diameter, and a very small particle size, with the particles having mean equivalent spherical diameter of from 0.2 to 0.4 microns. This particular clay filler provides rigidity and stiffness, as expected, but with better retention of other physical properties which are normally adversely affected by other mineral fillers, such as larger particle size clay and titanium dioxide. Adhesion between this clay and the polymer, which is already good, is further enhanced by pre cleaning the clay particles to remove surface dirt, chemicals and salts.
