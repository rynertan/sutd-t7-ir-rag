## Description
This invention is directed toward the preparation of random fiber reinforced thermoset polymer composites by a wet laid aqueous technique. Typically, such fiber reinforced thermoset polymer composites have been made by a hand lay up method where the reinforcing fibers are saturated with a resin and formed into a pre impregnated mat. The mat is then formed into a desired shape and treated at an elevated temperature and pressure to cure the thermoset polymer to form a densified fiber reinforced composite article. It is desirable, however, to form such fiber reinforced composites in a more efficient manner. A solution is to employ wet laid aqueous techniques such as are generally disclosed in U. S. Patents 4,426,470 and 4,431,696 U. K. Patent 1,263,812 French Patent Publication 2,507,123 and European Patent Publication 0,039,292 A1. US PS 4,426,470 discloses a process for making reinforced polymer composites wherein a dilute aqueous slurry of a solid water insoluble, heat fusible organic polymer, a reinforcing material and a latex binder is formed, the slurry is flocculated, wet laid, dewatered and dried. The heat fusible organic polymer is a polymer that is capable to join into a unitary structure when applying heat. According to the description of US PS 4,426,470 the heat fusible polymer may be a thermoplastic or thermosetting resin. However, the preferred embodiments and all of the examples in US PS 4,426,470 are concerned with the use of thermoplastic resin, whereby the use of thermoset resins is contemplated only to the extent that they behave like thermoplastic resins. GB PS 1 263 812 is concerned with a method of forming fibrous sheet material. According to this patent a fiber containing polymeric sheet material is formed and then thermoformed or cold pressed to form a smooth surface thereon. The sheet material comprises a particulate solid that may be a thermoplastic or thermosetting resin, and a binder that may be a thermoplastic, thermosetting or natural polymer or oligomer. A reaction between polymer and binder is neither suggested nor possible because at most one of the two components has functional groups. In these wet laid aqueous techniques thermoplastic polymers are used to produce fiber reinforced mats which can be subsequently shaped and fabricated into a composite article. The method of the invention now provides for the preparation of a random fiber reinforced thermoset polymer composite which can be prepared and fashioned into sheets and other useful articles of manufacture. More particularly, the present invention provides a process for preparing a random fiber reinforced thermoset polymer composite comprising the steps of The present invention accordingly provides that in one aspect the thermoset polymer remains heat formable prior to formation into a predetermined shape, step f , by employing a latent curing agent in the thermoset polymer formulation. In an alternative procedure, the thermoset polymer mat remains heat formable prior to formation into a predetermined shape, step f , and is subsequently saturated with the liquid coreactant, step e , to cure the thermoset polymer. The present invention also provides for a process by which the mat can be prepared by partial curing of the thermoset polymer such that the mat can be subsequently formed and fully cured into a useful article of manufacture. In another procedure of the invention, a mat containing reinforcing fibers and an uncured thermoset polymer is compressed into a densified composite thereby placing the reinforcement fibers under strain. The composite is then gradually heated to cause a partial curing of the polymer and a lofting effect in the composite prior to cross linking of the thermoset polymer. That is, as the polymer begins to soften the reinforcement fibers which are under flexural strain are allowed to relax and straighten to thereby expand the uncured polymer such that, in effect, the composite will become less dense and increase in volume. The partially cured lofted composite can then be fully cured by continued heating. In one aspect, the method is characterized by employing a thermoset polymer with a latent curing agent, step a ii, i.e., one which does not cure the polymer until the mat is dried and thermoformed. In another aspect, the method is characterized by curing the thermoset polymer after saturating the dried mat with a liquid or gaseous catalyst or coreactant, step e . For example, a liquid coreactant can be a vinyl polymerizable monomer such as styrene containing a catalyst. A gaseous catalyst can be, for example, ammonia which cures the polymeric portion of the mat. More specifically, in the method of the invention, a dilute aqueous slurry is prepared comprising an aqueous medium, thermoset polymer, reinforcing fibers, a binder, a flocculant, and other optional ingredients such as polymeric paste or fibers, colorants, anti oxidants, fillers, and the like. Typically, the reinforcing fibers are dispersed in the aqueous medium and the binder is then added. To this slurry is added and uniformily dispersed a solid thermoset polymer usually in the form of a powder, or as an aqueous dispersion. The resulting mixture is then flocculated and destabilized by using a polymeric flocculant. The flocculated slurry is then dewatered and the solids collected on the screen of a wet laid apparatus such as a sheet mold or other continuous wet laid equipment. The wet mat is then dried under conditions such that the thermoset polymer remains heat formable and, accordingly, is not totally cured. Drying of the mat may be conducted at ambient temperature, in an oven at an elevated temperature, in a vacuum chamber, or a combination thereof. Suitable methods are disclosed in U. S. Patent 4,426,470. The dried mat can be partially densified by passing the mat from the drier directly through nip rolls. Alternatively, the dried mat can be formed into an article of manufacture having the desired shape and cured. Curing of the thermoset polymer can be accelerated by the application of thermal energy, radiation, or chemical accelerators. In the method of step a ii, the polymer portion of the mat consists of a thermoset polymer and a curing agent which do not intimately mix until both components are heated and melted during the fabrication process. In the aforementioned saturation method of step e the mat can be formed into a desired shape prior to or after saturation with the coreactant and then cured. Alternatively, the mat can be saturated with the coreactant, molded and cured simultaneously. Optionally, the mat can be compressed and densified before saturation with the coreactant provided the densified mat remains porous enough to absorb or imbibe the coreactant. The wet laid process of the invention requires a thermoset polymer which is defined, for purposes of this invention, as a solid polymer at ambient temperatures which, upon the addition of a curing agent, accelerator or coreactant, and the application of heat, accelerates curing of the polymer to a thermoset solid. The saturation method of step e can employ condensation reactions such as between epoxy polymers and liquid curing agents. Typical thermoset polymers which can be employed are the epoxides, vinylized epoxides, vinyl esters, phenolics, polyesters, and phenol formaldehydes. Preferred thermoset polymers are epoxy, vinyl ester, or phenolic resins. More preferred are diglycidylether of bisphenol A type epoxy resins, epoxy novolac resins, and phenol formaldehyde type resins. Other suitable epoxy resins, are disclosed in Lee and Neville, A one stage or self curing thermoset polymer is produced by condensing a phenolic resin and an excess more than 110 percent of formaldehyde in the presence of a basic catalyst, e.g., ammonium or sodium hydroxide. This produces a thermosetting polymer when subjected to heat. A two stage thermoset polymer is produced by condensing a phenolic resin and an insufficient amount not more than 84 percent of formaldehyde in the presence of an acid catalyst. To cure this phenolic resin to a cross linked thermoset, a hardening agent, such as, hexamethylenetetramine, is used. Curing agents which can be employed with the thermoset polymers of the invention are selected from those which may produce a partial curing of the thermoset polymer during the initial preparation, dewatering and drying of a wet laid composite mat. Such curing agents are referred to as latent curing agents which become further activated during the final molding of the composite mat into a desired article. Generally, the latent curing agent will be activated at a temperature above ambient. Where the composite mat is dried at ambient temperature the latent curing agent can be chosen such that it is activated at a temperature of less than 100 C, but greater than ambient temperature. Preferably, the latent curing agent is activated at a temperature of greater than 100 C. Examples of curing agents which are suitable for preparing thermoset composites of the invention are, for example, benzoyl peroxide free radical initiator , aliphatic and aromatic amines or polyamines, polythiols, phenolics, anhydrides, diaminodiphenyl sulfone DADS , methylenedianiline, and Versamide , a trademark of General Mills Chemical, Inc. In cases where phenol formaldehyde type resins are employed, the preferred curing agents are hexamethylenetetraamine, urea formaldehyde, melamine formaldehyde or polyamines. Curing agents and their effects are more fully disclosed in the literature, for example, the Handbook of Epoxy Resins, supra and in Chemical Reactions of Polymers, Interscience Publishers, New York, pages 912 926, 1967 . In addition to the above mentioned curing agents, accelerators can be employed which are commonly utilized for rapid curing of thermoset polymers. The use of such accelerators in the present invention should not cause the thermoset composites to cure prematurely. The reinforcing fibers which are employed in the process of the invention include both organic and inorganic fibers such as glass fibers, graphite fibers, metal fibers, metal coated glass or graphite fibers, ceramic fibers, polymeric fibers such as fibers made from, for example, aromatic polyamide, cellulose or polyolefin. Mixtures of any of the aforementioned fibers may also be employed. Preferably glass fibers are employed such as chopped glass having an average length of from 3.2 to 25.4 mm 1 8 to 1 inch and or milled glass fibers having an average length of from 0.79 to 3.2 mm 1 32 to 1 18 inch . Preferably, the fibers have an aspect ratio ratio of length to diameter of greater than 40. More preferably, the fibers are glass fibers having a length of from 3 to 16 mm and a diameter of from 13 to 25 micrometer. The reinforcing fibers generally comprise from 10 to 80 weight percent of the total weight of solids, on a dry weight basis, of the fiber reinforced composite. A binder component is added to the aqueous slurry to aid in binding or adhering the components to each other while they are suspended in the slurry such that they can be destabilized and collected. Typical binders in wet laid systems include starches, synthetic polymers and natural polymers. Generally, the polymeric binders are ionically charged to aid in the destabilization of the solids in the slurry. In some cases the binder can co react with the thermoset polymer. Suitable polymeric binders having ionic charges are latex binders which are aqueous colloidal dispersions of substantially water insoluble organic polymers having anionic or cationic bound charges in an amount sufficient to provide stabilization of the colloid, but insufficient to cause the polymer to be water soluble. Such an amount of bound charge will usually be from 0.04 to 0.60 milliequivalent per gram meq g of polymer solids. The term bound to the polymer with respect to ionic groups or charges, refers to ionic groups or charges which are not desorbed from the polymer by dialysis of the latex against deionized water. By available charge is meant the amount of charge an ionizable group would provide to a polymer when fully ionized. In another embodiment the binder may contain pH independent groups. By the term pH independent groups as applied to ionic groups is meant that the groups are predominantly in an ionized form over a wide range of pH, i.e. a pH of from 2 to 12. Representative of such groups are sulfonium, sulfoxonium, isothiouronium, pyridinium, quaternary ammonium groups, sulfate and sulfonate groups. The essentially water insoluble organic polymers of the binder have a backbone which may be natural or synthetic and may be a homopolymer or a copolymer of two or more ethylenically unsaturated monomers or be derived from such homopolymers or copolymers. Representative organic polymer binders are natural or synthetic rubbers such as styrene butadiene, isoprene, butyl and other rubber like polymers of unsaturated monomers. Preferably such polymeric binders are film forming polymers at room temperature or below, although in a particular instance, a polymer may be used which is film forming at the temperature of the wet laid mat formation process. Polymeric binders which are made film forming by the use of plasticizers may also be used. Polymeric binders which are readily available in latex form are preferred, especially hydrophobic polymers which are prepared by emulsion polymerization of one or more ethylenically unsaturated monomers. When in latex form, such polymeric binders advantageously have a particle size of from 500 to 5000 10 ¹⁰m 500 Å to 5000 Å and preferably have a particle size of from 800 to 3000 10 ¹⁰m 800 to 3000 Å as measured by electron microscopy. Among latexes which can be used in the present invention are those described in U. S. Patent 4,056,501, issued November 1, 1977, to Gibbs et al. These latex binders are cationic structured particle latexes consisting of a water insoluble, nonionic, organic polymer core encapsulated with a thin layer of a copolymer having chemically bound pH independent cationic groups wherein the bound cationic charges are at or near the outer surface of the particles. Anionic latexes which may be employed are well known in the art and include such products as carboxylated styrene butadiene latexes and acrylic latexes which are prepared by emulsion polymerization. The binder is generally employed in an amount of from 1 to 10 weight percent of the total weight, on a dry solids basis, of the composite. Preferred latexes are those which when cast into films and dried have a relatively low water adsorption, and a relatively high wet tensile strength. These preferred latexes have a 24 hour water adsorption value of desirably less than about 20, preferably less than about 16, and most preferably less than about 14 percent as measured by ASTM D 570 63. The aqueous slurry is flocculated in order that the thermoset polymer, reinforcing fibers, binder and other dispersed ingredients can be collected from the aqueous dispersion or slurry. Typically, a polymeric flocculant opposite in charge to the binder, is employed. However, other means of destabilizing the aqueous phase can be employed. Examples of suitable flocculants include partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide for cationic systems, and modified cationic polyacrylamide and diallyldiethylammonium chloride for anionic systems. Additionally, the slurry of the subject invention can include fillers in an amount of up to 33 percent by weight, based on the total dry weight of solids in the composite. Examples of such fillers include silica compounds, CaCO₃, MgO, Mg OH ₂, CaSiO₃ wollastonite , mica, and mixtures thereof. Optionally, the composite may contain up to 10 weight percent of other additives such as, for example, pigments and dyes, UV stabilizers, antioxidants, foaming agents, antifoaming agents, bacteriocides, electromagnetic radiation absorption agents, depending on the particular use of the article to be produced. In particular, the optional addition of low levels of synthetic polymeric fibers or polyolefin pastes or pulp have been found to be advantageous in the wet laid preparation of the thermoset composite. For example, polyaramid pulp additives as disclosed in French Patent 2507123 A contribute to the cohesive properties of the composite mat. Other typical polymeric fibers are fibers made of polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinylchloride, polyester, polystyrene and ABS acrylonitrile butadiene styrene copolymer . Preferred polymeric fibers are commercially available from Himont Corporation under the trademark Pulpex E for polyethylene fibers and under the trademark Pulpex P for polypropylene fibers. Generally, the polymeric fibers are present in an amount of from 1 to 10, preferably from 3 to 5 weight percent, based on the total dry weight of solids in the composite. Optionally, the aqueous portion of the slurry can be thickened to aid in the dispersion and stabilization of the solid ingredients in the aqueous slurry. Thickeners which can be added to the aqueous portion of the slurry are, for example, methylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, polymers of acrylamides, gums, or clays. One such group of thickeners is commercially available from Kelco Company under the trademark Kelzan , for xanthan gums. Thickened aqueous mediums having a viscosity above 10 ³ Pa s 1 centipoise are preferred as measured by Brookfield LVDT at 12 rpm . More preferable are viscosities from 1.5 to 10.10 ³ Pa s 1.5 to 10 cp . In the following examples, all weights are given as a dry weight, based on the total weight of the composite ingredients, unless otherwise specified.
