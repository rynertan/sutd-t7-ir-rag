# TWO PIECE ATTACHMENT CLIP FOR INSULATED ROOF OR WALL STRUCTURE

## Abstract
A two piece concealed type clip assembly useful in attaching profiled panel members to structural elements to provide an insulated roof or wall structure incorporating blanket or roll type insulation. The clip assembly includes a U shaped base clip having a relatively narrow bottom wall, upstanding sidewalls, and integral clip stabilizing portions, one extending laterally outwardly from each sidewall and flexible connecting means such as a top clip, carried at the upper ends of the sidewalls for connecting a rib of a panel member to a structural element. Only a minor amount of insulation is fully compressed at each clip assembly site whereby the structure exhibits an improved thermal effi ciency.
