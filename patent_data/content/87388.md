## Description
Colour couplersThis invention relates to pyrazolone colour couplers.Pyrazolone compounds have long been used as four equivalent colour couplers in colour photographic materials. However, it has been found that these compounds are very susceptible to attack by formaldehyde and other aldehydes. Synthetic plastics materials have almost entirely replaced leather as camera cases and camera accessory bags.
