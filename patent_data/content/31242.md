# Production of acetamides with rhodium manganese catalysts.

## Abstract
A heterogeneous process for selectively producing acetamides in which the acyl nitrogen is otherwise bonded to methyl, ethyl, hydrogen or combinations thereof which comprises contacting a mixture of a carbon monoxide, b hydrogen and c ammonia and or nitric oxide with a heterogeneous solid catalyst comprising rhodium and manganese at a temperature of from about 200 to about 450 C, a pressure of from about 15 to about 10,000 psig and a mole ratio of hydrogen to carbon monoxide of from about 20 1 to about 1 20.
