# Binary circuit with selectable output polarity.

## Abstract
The present invention combines in a logical AND function N logical input signals, where N is a selected positive integer greater than or equal to 1, and provides programmably, either a direct AND output signal or a NAND output signal. The invention accomplishes this using a minimum number of components in the data path, between the logical input leads 50 and logical output leads 57 . A minimum of components in the data path reduces the propagation delay introduced by the circuit. The invention accomplishes this by providing two AND gates 55, 51 con nected to the same set of N logical input signals. The output signal of one AND gate 55 is inverted by an inverter 54 with an enable disable input lead 59 . The output signal of the other AND gate 51 is inverted twice by two inverters 52, 53 . The second inverter 53 has an enable disable input lead 58 . Means 60 64 are provided for exclusively enabling one or the other of the two inverters 53, 54 with an enable disable input lead 58, 59 . Thus, either the once inverted signal is provided to the output lead 57 or the twice inverted signal is provided to the output lead 57 .
