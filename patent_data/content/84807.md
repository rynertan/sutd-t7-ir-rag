# A method for the quantitative determination of a target substance.

## Abstract
A quantitative determination of a substance is performed in a homogenous system based on a change in enzyme activi ty according to a method, in which the differences between the activity of a free enzyme and that of an enzyme bound by aggregation or chemical bonding are observed. A peroxidase labeled antibody and antigen system is one of the typical ex amples. Since the reaction is effected in a homogenous sys tem, the amount of antigen can be easily measured by the dif ferences of enzyme activity.
