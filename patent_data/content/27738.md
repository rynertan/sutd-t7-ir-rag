# INTRUSION ALARM SYSTEM

## Abstract
Structural moment detectors 31 are carried by structural members, such as floors, walls, etc., within a secure area 30 of a building structure. The structural moment detectors detect deflections of the various structural members in response to changes of the loading of structural members caused by an intruder and generate signals which are trans mitted to a control centre 34 which receives the intrusion signals and generates alarm signals. The intrusion signals are transmitted to the control centre 34 through the building structure as impulsive loads applied to the building structure by transducers 35 located in the secure area which are responsive to the signals generated by the structural moment detectors 31 . The alarm signals 42 generated the control centre are transmitted to security systems 46 located in the secure area, such as automatic door locking mechanisms, lights, audible alarms, disabling gas injecting systems, etc., by means of coded impulsive loads applied to the building struc ture by transducers 47 located in the control centre which are responsive to the intrusion signals.
