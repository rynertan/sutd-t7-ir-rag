# Apparatus for performing solution growth of group II VI compound semiconductor crystal.

## Abstract
In performing a solution growth of a Group II VI compound semiconductor crystal by relying on the tempera ture difference technique under controlled vapor pressure on a solution growth apparatus having a recrystallizing zone, a source crystal supply zone and a vapor pressure controlling zone enclosed in a growth quartz tube and placed under different temperatures for the respective zones, wherein a heat sink is provided at the bottom end portion of the recrystallizing zone to cause a thermal flow to pass there through to the outside of the whole apparatus to insure that a single crystal will grow from this bottom end portion of the zone. The quartz tube may be enclosed in a pressure resistant tube to apply a pressure to the growth quartz tube externally thereof to avoid its destruction to enable the growth to be performed at a high temperature to obtain a high growth rate. Thus, a large size crystal having a good crystal perfection can be grown.
