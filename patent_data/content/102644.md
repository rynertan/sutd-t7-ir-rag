# Semiconductor integrated circuit device.

## Abstract
A semiconductor integrated circuit device is disclosed. A plurality of unit cells 2 each having at least a basic transistor device fixedly arranged on one main surface of a semicon ductor substrate are arranged in a line to form a unit cell line. At least two of such unit cell lines are arranged in adjacent to and in parallel with each other to form a basic cell line 3 . A plurality of such basic cell lines 31 are arranged in parallel with each other with a wiring region 4 of a predetermined width being interleaved between adjacent basic cell lines 3 .
