# Polymerization catalyst, production and use.

## Abstract
A vanadium containing catalyst component useful for polymerizing olefins to polyolefins having a high molecular weight and broad molecular weight distribution comprising polymerizing the olefins in the presence of a catalyst comprising a a vanadium containing catalyst component obtained by contacting an inert support material with an organoaluminum compound, a halogenating agent and a vanadium compound, and b an aluminum alkyl cocatalyst.
