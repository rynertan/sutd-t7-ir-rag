# Process for preparing dienoic acids.

## Abstract
A process is described for preparing dienoic acids, in particular octadienoic 3,6 and 2,6 acids, by re acting butadiene with a 3 butenoic acid of formula I R R₁C CR₂ CR₃ HCOOH I wherein R R₁ R₂ R₃, either like or unlike one another, are hydrogen atoms or alkyl groups having up to 4 carbon atoms, optionally containing double bonds and or inert substituting groups, such as alkyl, alkoxyl, carbo alkoxyl groups, in an inert atmosphere, at a temperature within the range of from 60 to 140 C approximately and in the presence of at least a catalyst selected from amongst the phosphinic complexes of Rhodium and or the phosphitic complexes of Nickel having formulae III , IV , V and VI III Rh P R₄ ₃ The resulting compounds are utilized as intermedia tes for organic syntheses.
