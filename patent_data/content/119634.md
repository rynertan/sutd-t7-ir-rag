# Resonator for internal combustion engines.

## Abstract
A resonator 100 for internal combustion engine 1 having a plurality of resonant frequencies in order to reduce an intake noise over a wide range of engine speeds. Any of a plurality of tubular connecting members 15 can form a connecting passage from an intake pipe 13 or an exhaust pipe 8 of the engine 1 to a resonator means 17 . As the tubular connecting members 15 are changed by a switch ing means 20 in accordance with operational conditions of the engine 1 , the resonator means 17 absorb the noise from the engine 1 satisfactorily.
