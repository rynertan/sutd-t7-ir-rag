# Heat resistant, wear resistant, and high strength aluminum alloy powder and body shaped therefrom.

## Abstract
A heat resistant, wear resistant and high strength alumi num alloy powder is described which contains from approxi mately 10.0 to approximately 30.0 of silicon and at least one element selected from the group consisting of from approximately 5.0 to approximately 15.0 of nickel, from approximately 3.0 to approximately 15.0 of iron, and from approximately 5.0 to approximately 15.0 of man ganese, the silicon crystals in the aluminum alloy powder being 15 µm or less in size. Due to the content of nickel, iron, and manganese, the matrix is hardened and strengthened by the presence of finely dispersed intermetallic compounds and the silicon crystals. Further, a shaped body, e.g., a hot extruded shaped body, is described comprising an aluminum alloy powder having the above composition, the intermetallic compounds being 20 µm or less in size being finely distributed in the shaped body.
