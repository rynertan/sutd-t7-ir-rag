# Cooling element mounts for infra red detectors and their envelope arrangements.

## Abstract
A infra red detector and envelope arrangement for the detector have a novel mount 21, 22, 23, 24 for a Joule Thomson or other cooling element 10 . The mount is a single unit 21, 22, 23, 24 which includes an inner part 23 on which the cooling element 10 is mounted e.g. via an adaptor 30 . The cooling element 10 is secured in a dewar 1, 2 of the envelope arrangement by attaching an outer part 21, 22 of the mount 21, 22, 23, 24 to a dewar mount 13 e.g. by bolts 22 . These inner and outer parts 23 and 21, 22 which may have overlapping flanges are elastically coupled together by a resilient part 24 of the unit 21, 22, 23, 24 . The resilient coupling reduces movement and strain of the inner dewar wall 1 caused by movement of the cooling element both during assembly and use of the detector. A fluid inlet 51, 52 may be present on said outer part 22, 21 , and a flexible pipe 11 may extend between the outer and inner parts 21, 22 and 23 to connect said inlet 51, 52 to said cooling element 10 .
