# METHOD OF RETURNING ROTARY SHAFT TO REFERENCE POINT.

## Abstract
A work coordinate system constituting a programming reference is determined with respect to a mechanical coor dinate system, and NC program data, which include at least NC data for determining an angle r between the origin WR in the work coordinate system and the reference point MR in the mechanical coordinate system, and radial positioning data based on the work coordinate system, are prepared, the position controlling of the rotary shaft being done on the basis of the NC program. The present positions P
