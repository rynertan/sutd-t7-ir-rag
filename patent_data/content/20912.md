# Air cooled electronic assemblies.

## Abstract
To improve the efficiency of cooling in an air cooled electronic assembly of finned electronic modules 10 mounted on a board 100 which forms an enclosure for the modules with a cover 40 , the cover is individually apertured for each module so that an individual cooling air stream is provided for each module which flows towards the board, rather than across the board, through a substantial portion of the fins. Cooling air is moved by a dual pull air moving mechanism 26, 28, 30 venting to atmosphere through failsafe flaps 50 . Each opening 42 in the cover has its own cooling adjustment slides 52 . Air exhaustion is by way of air channels 34 between the modules and not by way of other modules, such secondary impingement being prevented by cross flow baffles 38 , relative fin rotation and by air flow guides 44 .
