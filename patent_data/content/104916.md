# Depositing a film onto a substrate including electron beam evaporation.

## Abstract
A single crystal ingot I of boron doped silicon is elec tron beam heated in ionised hydrogen. Using an electrode E to apply an electric field from the ingot I towards a heated substrate S, which is r.f. biassed, an amorphous boron doped silicon film deposits on the substrate S. Intrinsic and n type material can also be produced.
