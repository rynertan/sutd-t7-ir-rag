# CRYSTALLISATION OF FRUCTOSE

## Abstract
A continuous process for the crystallisation of fructose from an aqueous fructose syrup containing at least 90 by weight fructose on a dry solids basis, in which the syrup at a total solids content of at least 95 by weight is rapidly and thoroughly mixed with seed, at a temperature of 55 75 e.g. for up to 2.5 minutes is then deposited onto a surface where it is allowed to crystallise under quiescent conditions at a temperature of about 50 70 , until a solid cake is formed and is then comminuted to provide a free flowing granular product which can be further dried. The process provides a particulate product in the form of crystals in a glossy matrix, in which 95 of the crystals have a particle size of less than 20 microns, the overall degree of crystallinity is greater than 70 , the bulk density is less than 0.65 and which is completely free of organic solvent residues. Other food ingredients may be added simul taneously with the seed.
