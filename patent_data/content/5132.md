# Aspirator for air sampling.

## Abstract
An aspirator for air sampling, the air samples being sucked into a glass vessel for a certain period of time. The aspirator can be carried in a pocket, for example, by the one whose working environment is being analyzed. In a casing there is disposed a replaceable cylinder 2 with associated plunger 4 . The plunger is intended to be pulled in by a motor unit 12 and gearbox, arranged adjacent the cylinder 2 , the unit 12 rotating a drum 8 onto which is wound a string. The other string end is fixed, via a pulley 7 , to the spring loaded plunger 4 . When air has been sucked in to a sufficient amount, the opening 3 of the cylinder 2 is closed and the plunger 4 can be released from the string and the spring, which is possible since the plunger 4 is only magnetically retained.
