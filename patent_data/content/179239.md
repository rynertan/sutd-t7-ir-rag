In the conversion of the corresponding 6 amino compound to the 6 fluoro compound of formula I, the conversion is preferably carried out by first preparing the 6 diazonium chloride, reacting it with hexafluorophosphoric acid, i,e., HPF6, to produce the corresponding 6 diazonium hexafluorophosphate, conveniently as its hydrofluorophosphate, and heated the latter to produce the 6 fluoro compound of formula I. In the purification process aspect of the invention, the ethyl 3 carboxylate is formed, isolated and saponified to produce the purified compound of formula I, The preferred process, according to process b , comprises heating 4 2 fluorophenyl 2,6 dimethyl 3,5pyridinedicarboxylic acid to produce a mixture of 4 C2 fuorophenyl 2,6 dimethylpyridine and 2,4 dimethyl 5E tl benzopyranof3,4 c pyridin 5 one, separating the components of said mixture, and nitrating the 4 2fluorophenyl 2,6 dimethylpyridine thus obtained to produce 4 2 fluoro 5 nitrophenyl 2,6 dimethylpyridine.As shown hereinbelow, 4 2 fluoro 5 nitrophenyl 2,6 dimethylpyridine is useful as an intermediate to prepare in very good yield the corresponding 4 5 amino 2 fluorophenyl 2, 6 dimethylpyridine which is converted in four steps all in very good yields to l ethyl 6 fluoro 1,4 dihydro 7 2,6 dimethyl 4 pyridinyl 4 oXo 3 quinolinecarboxylic acid. The overall process provides an improved and convenient means for preparing large scale quantities of said antibacterial agent. The invention further resides in a compound of the formula IIEMI8.1 where Q is hydrogen or nitro, or acid addition salt thereof. As noted above, these compounds are useful as key intermediates in the preparation of the highly potent antibacterial agent, 1 ethyl 6 fluoro 1,4 dihydro 7 2,6 dimethyl 4 pyridinyl 4 oxo 3 quinolinecarboxylic acid. The compounds of formulas I and II are useful both in the free base form and in the form of acid addition salts, and, both forms are within the purview of the invention.The acid addition salt is simply an alternative form for uset and in practice, use. of the salt form inherently amounts to use of the base form. The acids which can be used to prepare the acid addition salts of the compounds of fonmiks I and II include preferably those which produce, when combined with the free base, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, that is, salts whose anions are relatively innocuous to the animal organism in pharmaceutical doses of the salts, so that the beneficial antibacterial properties inherent in the free base are not vitiated by side effects ascribable to the anions.Appropriate pharmaceutically acceptable salts within the scope of the invention are those derived from mineral acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid and sulfamic acid and organic acids such as lactic acid, acetic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, p toluenesulfonic acid, cyclohexylsulfamic acid, suinic acid, and the like, givinq the hvrochloride, hydrobromide, sulfate. phosphate sulfamate, lactate, acetate, citrate, tartrate, methanesulfonate, ethanesul fdnate, benzenesulfonate, p toluenesulfonate, cyclohexylsulfamate and urinate, respectively. The acid addition salts of said compounds of forrtulas I and II are prepared either by dissolving the free base in aqueous or aqueous alcohol solution or other suitable solvents containing the appropriate acid and isolating the salt by evaporating the solution, or by reacting the free base and acid in an organic solvent, in which case the salt separates directly or can be obtained by concentration of the solution. Other pharmaceutically acceptable salts of said compound of formula I are those cationic salts derived from strong inorganic or organic bases, e.g., sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, trimethylammonium hydroxide, to produce the corresponding cationic salt, e.g., sodium, potassium, trimethylammonium salt, respectively. Although pharmaceutically acceptable salts of said basic compounds of formula II is preferred, all acid addition salts are within the scope of the inO39 All acid addition salts are useful as sources of the free base form even if the particular salt per Se is desired only as an intermediate product as for example when the salt is forme only for purposes of purification or identification, or when it is used as an intermediate in preparing a pharmaceutically acceptable salt bv ion exchange procedures.I The molecular structure of the compounds of formula I and corresponding intermediate 6 nitro and 6 amino compounds and of the compounds of formula II were assigned on the basis of evidence provided by infrared, ultraviolet, nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectra, by the correspondence of calculated and found values for the elemental analyses, and by their method of preparation. The manner of making and using the instant invention will now be generally described so as to enable a person skilled in the art of pharmaceutical chemistrv to make and use the same. The nitration of the known 1 ethyl 1,4 dihydro 7 2,6 dimethyl 4 pyridinvl 4 oxo 3 quinolinecarboxylic acid U.S. Patent 3,753,993 to produce the corresponding 6 nitro compound was carried out by reacting said known compound with concentrated nitric acid in the presence of concentrated sulfuric acid, the reaction carried out by first mixing the reactants at ambient temperaturs and then heating the reaction mixture at about 90 C. to 110 C., conveniently on a steam bath. The product was obtained by pouring the cooled reaction mixture into excess ice water and partially neutralizing to a pH of about 5.5 to 6.0 the aqueous acidic solution with concentrated ammonium hydroxide and collecting the precipitated 6 nitro compound. The conversion of l ethyl 1,4 dihvdro 7 12,6 di methyl 4 pyridinvl 6 nitro 4 oxo 3 quinolinecarboxvlic acid to the corresponding 6 amino compound was conveniently carried out by heating the 6 nitro compound at about 9O0C. to 1100C., conveniently on a steam bath, with sodium hydrosulfite also named sodium dithionite in an aqueous alkaline medium containing an organic solvent, e.g . dimethylformamide, sodium bicarbonate conveniently used to make the solution alkaline. The 6 amino compound was isolated by acidifying the cooled reaction mixture to a pH of about 5.5, preferably with acetic acid, and collecting the precipitated 6 amino compound.Alternatively, the reduction of the 6 nitro compound to the corresponding 6 amino compound can be carried out by catalytic hydrogenation using palladium on charcoal as catalyst and acetic acid as solvent. The conversion of 6 amino l ethyl 1,4 dihydro 7 2,6 dimethyl 4 pyridinyl 4 oxo 3 quinolinecarboxylic acid to the corresponding 6 fluoro compound was done by first preparing the 6 diazonium salt, preferahly chlor ide, treating its aqueous solution at about 100C. using an ice salt bath with hexafluorophosphoric acid carefully added in one portion , collecting the precipitated 6 diazonium hexafluorophosphate as its hydrohexafluorophosphate, heating the diazonium salt at about 2000C.to 2400C., preferably about 2250C. to 2350C., in a suitable solvent, e.g., paraffin oil, dissolving the cooled reaction mixture with aqueous ammonium hydroxide e.g., 5N , filtering the solution and slightly acidifying to a pH of about 5.5 the filtrate with acetic acid and collecting the precipitated 6 fluoro compound of formulaI , which contained about 10 15 of the 6 desfluoro compound produced during decomposition of the diazonium salt and a trace of the corresponding 6 hvdroxy compound.The 6 fluoro compound was separated from said impurities by converting it to its lower alkvl, preferably ethvl, ester, separating the ester from the correspondinq ester of the 6 desfluoro compound and of the 6 hydroxy compound by high pressure liquid chromatography and then saponifying the ester to produce the purified 6 fluoro acid of formula I. As shown hereinbelow in Example 3, the intermed irate 4 2 fluoophenyl 2,6 dimethyl 3,5 pyridinedicar boxylic acid used in process b, was arepund in very good yield by first adding g concentrated aqueous ammonia to a mixture of 2 fluorobenzaldehyde and methvl acetoacetate in methanol to produce dimethyl 4 2 fluorophenyl l,4 dihyro 2,6 dimethyl 3,5 pyridinedicarboxylate, oxidizing the 1,4 dthydro compound with 4N nitric acid to produce dimethyl 4 2 fluorophenyl 2,6 dimethyl 3,5 pyridinedicarboxylate and saponifying the latter ester by heating it with sodium hydroxide in aqueous methanol at about 60 650C. to produce 4 2 fluorophenyl 2,6 dimethyl 3,5 pyridinedi carboxylic acid. Decarboxylation of 4 2 fluoropyhenyl 2,6 dimethyl3,5 pyridinedicarboxylic acid to produce 4 2 fluorophenyl 2,6 dimethylpyridine was carried out conveniently by heating the dicarboxylic acid at about 2400C. to 3000C., preferably about 240 255 C., in a suitable high boiling solvent, preferably by refluxing said dicarboxylic acid in a eutectic mixture of diphenyl and diphenyl ester Dowtherm A whereupon there resulted in the formation of 4 2 fluorophenyl 2,6 dimethylpvridine and varying amounts of 2,6 dimethyl 5H 1 benzopyrano 3,4 c pyridin5 one as a side product, filtering off the side product from the cooled reaction mixture and then isolating the desired product. After removal of the side product, the desired product is isolated from the remaining reaction mixture by extracting it with an aqueous mineral acid, preferably HCl, making the acidic extract alkaline, preferably with aqueous ammonia, and extracting the prod uct with a suitable solvent such as chloroform, ether or methylene dichloride. Other high boiling solvents that can be used in place of Dowtherm A are mineral oil, dimethyl phthalate and the like. In using the preferredDowtherm A, it was found that a greater proportion of the desired 4 2 fluorophenyl 2,6 dimethylpyridine and a lesser amount of the said side product were obtained by using a larger quantity of Dowtherm A. Use of recycled or previously used Dowtherm A decreased the yield of desired product. The conversion of 4 2 fluorophenyl 2,6 dimethylpyridine to 4 2 fluoro 5 nitrophenyl 2,6 dimethylpyri dine was carried out bv adding a molar equivalent auantitv or slight excess of a metal nitrate. preferably potassium nitrate, to 4 2 fluorophenyl 2,6 dimethylpyridine in excess concentrated sulfuric acid, keeping the reaction temperature below about 0 C., preferably between about 100C. to 15 C., conveniently accomplished using an salt ice bath. Alternatively, other alkali metal or alkaline earth metal nitrates, e.g., sodium nitrate or calcium nitrate, can be used in place of potassium nitrate. As illustrated hereinbelow in Example 6, 4 2 fluoro 5 nitrophenyl 2,6 dimethylpyridine is converted to l ethyl 6 fluoro 1,4 dihydro 7 2 ,6 dimethYl 4 pYri dinyl 4 oxo 3 quinolinecarboxylic acid in very good yield by first reducing 4 2 fluoro 5 nitropbenyl 206 dimethylpyridine by catalytic hydrogenation to produce 4 5 amino 2 fluorophenyl 2,6 dimethylpyridine, alterna tively named 3 2,6 dimethyl 4 pyridinyl 4 fluorobenzene amine Example 6A , reacting the 5 amino 2 fluorophenyl compound of Example 6A with a di lower alkyl diethyl ethoxymethylenemalonate EMME to produce a di lower alkyl diethyl 3 2,6 dimethyl 4 pyridinyl 4 fluoroanilinomethylenemalonate Example 4B , refluxing the EMME adduct of Example 6B in Dowtherm A to produce a lower alkyl ethyl 6 fluoro l,4 dihydro 7 2,6 dimethyl 4 pyridinyl 4 oxo 3 quinolinecarboxylate Example 6C , ethylating the compound of Example 6C by heating it with an ethylating agent, that is, the ethyl ester of an inorganic acid or a strong organic acid, e.g., ethyl iodide, in dimethylformamide in the presence of anhydrous potassium carbonate to produce ethyl l ethyl6 fluoro 1,4 dihydro 7 2,6 dimethyl 4 pyridinyl 4oxo 3 quinolinecarboxylate Example 6D and hydrolyzing the compound of Example 6D by refluxing it in aqueous sodium hydroxide solution containing methanol to produce l ethyl 6 fluoro 1,4 dihydro 7 2,6 dimethyl 4 pyridinyl 4oxo 3 quinolinecarboxylic acid Example 6E .Although the carboxylate is ethylated according to the above preferred procedure, it is also possible to hydrolyze the lower alkyl ester obtained by Example 6C and ethylate the resulting acid under substantially the same conditions for said respective corrosion steps. The following examples will further illustrate the invention without limiting it thereto. Example 1A. 1 Ethyl 1,4 dihydro 7 2,6 dimethyl 4 pyridinyl 6 nitro 4 oxo 3 quinolinecarboxvlic Acid To a stirred solution containing 200 g. of 7 2,6 dimethyl 4 pvridinyl l ethyl 1,4 dihydro 4 oxo 3 quinolinecarboxylic acid in 440 ml of 95 98 H2SO4 was added a solution of 80 ml of 90 HNO3 in 80 ml of 95 98 H2SO4 over a period of one hour.

B. 6 Amino 1 ethyl 1,4 dihydro 7 2,6 dimethyl 4 pyridinvl 4 oxo 3 guinolinecar.boxylic Acid A 35 g portion of 1 ethyl 1,4 dihydro 6 nitjro 7 2,6 dimethyl 4 pyridinyl 4 oxo 3 quinolinecarboxylic acid was suspended in a mixture of 350 ml of hot dimethylformamide, 280 ml of saturated NaHCO3 and 70 ml of water and the suspension was heated on a steam bath with stirring.A mixture of 58 g of sodium hydrosulfite in 100 ml of water was added in portions over a period of 20 minutes, during which time the reaction mixture became a clear solution and then darkened. More saturated NaHCO3 solution 50 ml was added and the reaction mixture was heated for 16 hours, after which time reduction was not complete.More sodium hydrosulfite 12 g was added directly to the reaction mixture and heating continued for 1 hour after which time the reduction appeared to be complete byTLC . Water 100 ml was added, redissolving some of the material which had come out of solution and, the mixture was heated an additional 90 minutes to insure completion of the reduction. A 1.15 g sample, m.p. 288 290CC. with decomposition, was recrystallized from ethanol and dried for 16 hours at 1300C. under high vacuum to yield 0.9 g of 6 amino 1 ethyl 1,4 dihydro 7 2,6 dimethyl 4 pyridinyl 4 oxo 3 quinolinecarboxylic acid as its monohydrate, m.p. 3000C.

Win 35,439 was bacteriostatic against the 3 strains of S. pyogenes. Although less potent than Win 52.522, methicillin was also bactericidal for the Gram positive cocci, while vancomycin was bacteriostatic for one strain of S. pneumoniae and all 4 strains of S. faecalis. Relative to Win 35,439, Win 52,522 was 2 to 8 times more potent in vitro against the Gram positive cocci and E. coli. and similarly potent against P. aeruginosa. These results are consistent with in vivo mouse protection tests where Win 52,522 was 3.6 s.c. to 3.9 p.o. times more efficacious than Win 35,439 against an S. aureus, and 2.6 s.c. to 2.0 p.o. times more efficacious against an E coli infection Experiment 3 hereinbelow . Win 52,522 was 32 to 8000 times more potent in vitro than methicillin against the Staphvlococcus species, 32 to 500 times more potent than methicillin againstS. faecalis, but was 2 to 8 times less potent than methicillin against S. Neogenes dnd S. pneumoniae. Win 52,522 was 16 to 125 times more potent in vitro than vancomycin against the Gram positive cocci with two exceptions 1 Win 52,522 was 8 times less potent than vancomycin against S. pneumoniae tv,e III and, 2 was equal in potency against the one enterococcus strain 0 2 B tested. The in vitro test results here support the results from an in vivo test showing Win 52,522 to be 16 and 91 times more efficacious than vancomycin and methicillin, respectively, against a methicillin resistantStaphylococcus aureus infection in mice. From the in vitro results reported here and the in vivo results shown hereinbelow Experiment 3 , it follows that Win 52,522 should be even more effective than vancomycin in killing deep seated staphylococcal tissue infections.

Experiment 2ANTIMICROBIAL ACTIVITY OF WIN 52,522, WIN 35,439, ROSOXACIN, NORFLOXACIN, PEFLOXACIN AND TETRACYCLINE AGAINSTANAEROBIC AND MICROAEROPHILIC BACTERIA ASSOCIATED WITH ORAL INFECTIONSSummary Win 52,522 was found to have high activity against all thirteen of the target anaerobic microorganisms and compared favorably with tetracycline, the current antibiotic of choice. Introduction It is generally accepted that certain microorganisms are the primary etiologic agents in the initiation of periodontal diseases Socransky et al.,Present Status of Studies on the Microbial Etiology ofPeriondontal Diseases, pp. 1 14. In R. Genco and S.Mergenhagen Ed. , Host Parasite Interactions in Periodontal Diseases, 1982, Amer. Soc. Micro. Washington,DC. Furthermore, there is increasing evidence to support the hypothesis that specific microorganisms are associated with each of the various forms of periodontal disease Socransky et al., supra . Accordingly, the rationale has been advanced for the use of antimicrobials in the prevention, control and treatment of these pandemic diseases. There is evidence in various animal models that the administration of various antibiotics can reduce the clinical signs of gingivitis and also decrease the.progression of alveolar hone loss associated with aggressive periodontal diseases Gibson, Antibiotics and Periodontal Disease Selective Review, J. Amer. Dent.Assoc. 104, 213 218 1982 . In man, the data would also appear supportive of the argument that antimicrobial agents are extremely useful in treating established disease, particutarly when used to augment conventional therapies Gibson, supra . In this regard, the antibiotics tetracycline and metronidazole have been shown to be partic ularly useful Genco, Antibiotics in the Treatment ofHuman Periodotal Diseases. J. Periodontol. 52, 545 558 1981 3 however, these agents do not appear to be ideal since they are not active against all the microorganisms considered to participate in the disease process.Furthermore, there are an increasing number of reports indicating that many of the so called primary pathogens of periodontal disease have already evidenced patterns of increased tolerance to these agents lGibson, supra, Genco, supra and Williams et al., Subgingival Microflora ofPeriodontal Patients On Tetracycline TheraDvl J. Clin.Periodontol. 6, 210 215 1979 . Hence, there exists an important and timely need to discover and develop new antimicrobial agents which will have utility in the prevention management of periodontal diseases. The studies described herein show that Win 52,522 was found to be extremely active against a number of anaerobic microorgan isms associated with periodontal diseases. Microorganisms The mic roorganisms used in these studies are listed in Table A hereinbelow.Culture Conditions 1. Maintenance. Prior to use, all strains were maintained in the lyophilized state. During the study, cultures were examined on blood agar basal medium supplemented with 5.0 v v defibrinated rabbit blood. Culture transfer was accomplished weekly with all cultures being incubated in an anaerobic atmosphere GasPak jar BBL . 2. Aqar Medium. The basal test medium consisted of trypticase soy agar 40 g , yeast extract 1 g , glucose 2 g and 960 ml of distilled water pH 7.2. Mashimo et al., J. Clin. Micro. 17, 187 191 1983 . Subsequent to sterilization and coolinq to 500C., the medium was supplemented with 4 v v defibrinated rabbit blood and 0.5 rg ml menadione vitamin K3 . The agent under evaluation was also added at this time to the concentration desired. Subsequent to pouring of the plates, they were permitted to dry at 40C. for 24 br. 3. Determination of Agent MIC. The minimal inhibitory concentration MIC of the various test agents was determined using an aqar dilution technique. Agents and appropriate reference compounds were added to achieve a series of concentrations ranging between 32 ug ml and 0.007 g ml. The inocula were prepared from 96 hr. cultures grown on the maintenance medium. Subsequent to a purity evaluation, colonies were removed and suspended in trypticase soy broth supplemented with 5 g ml menadione and 2 lysed rabbit blood filtrate to achieve anOD650 of 0.1 this corresponded to aprroximately 108 cells ml . Cultures were inoculated aerobically on the modified trypticase soy blood agar plates by use of aSterr s replicator which delivers about 105 cells per spot .The plates were allowed to dry for a time not exceeding 30 min. and then incubated at 370C. under an atmosphere of 80 N2, 10 , H2 and 59 C02 main an anaerobic chamber Coy Manufacturing Co. for 48 hr.The MIC was defined as the lowest concentration completely inhibiting growth.Agents Tetracycline stock solutions 1 mg ml were made subsequent to dissolution in water. Stock solutions 1 mq ml of the remaining test compounds were made subsequent to dissolution in 1 10 N NaOH. Appronriate controls indicated at the levels used NaOH did not affect the viability of the test microorganisms.Results The antimicrobial activities of the compounds tested are shown in Table A.
