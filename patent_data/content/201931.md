# Power transmission for automotive vehicle.

## Abstract
A power transmission for automotive vehicles includes a trans axle housing 10 formed therein with first, second and third compartments 13, 14, 15 which are in open communi cation with each other and store therein an amount of lubricating oil, a change speed gear transmission 20 mounted within the first compartment, a first transfer gear mechanism 30 mounted within the second compartment and in drive connection with the gear transmission, and a second transfer gear mechanism 40 mounted within the third compartment and in drive connection with the first transfer gear mechanism coaxially therewith. For sufficient lubrication of the second transfer gear mechanism 40 , an oil pump 51 is mounted within the first compartment to be driven by the output drive power applied thereto from the gear transmission and is connected to a communication passage 53, 54a, 54b, 55, 56a, 56b, 56c extending therefrom to the third compartment 15 through the second compart ment 14 to introduce lubricating oil discharged from the oil pump into the third compartment.
