# Reduntant type memory circuit with an improved clock generator.

## Abstract
A redundant type memory circuit having a normal mem ory cell array, a first decoder circuit for operatively accessing normal array, a redundant memory cell array, a second decoder circuit for accessing the redundant array, and a prog rammable timing control circuit for enabling the first decoder circuit at a first delay period when no faulty cell exists in the normal array and at a second longer delay period when a faulty cell exists in the normal array.
