# Apparatus for heat treating a liquid product and a method of operating and cleaning the said apparatus.

## Abstract
Apparatus for heat treating a liquid product comprising series connected multi tube heat exchangers such as heat ing up heat exchangers 6,12, a high temperature heat exchanger 14 and cooling down heat exchangers 17, 18, 19, the heating up heat exchangers and cooling down heat ex changers being interconnected by means of a pipe system 25, 26 34 for regenerative heat exchange. The heat exchan gers being connected by means of connection members 13 having separate passages which connect the tubes of one heat exchanger to those of the next heat exchanger. The pipe system for regenerative heat exchange being designed so that the quantity of heat to be transferred can be adjusted in order to adapt said apparatus to varying capacities.
