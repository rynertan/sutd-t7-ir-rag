# Yarn cutting and clamping apparatus for circular knitting machines.

## Abstract
Both the leading and trailing ends of the respective yarns introduced to and removed from active knitting position are cut to a uniform length on the inside of the sock when forming solid color patterned areas in the sock. The cutting of all yarn ends to a uniform length inside of the sock enables the operator to easily evert and inspect the inside of the socks as they are removed from the knitting machine and eliminates the usual time consuming operation of cutting the yarn ends after the sock is knit. The cutting and clamping apparatus includes a pair of suction tubes 44, 44 supported within the needle cylinder 10 and yarn clamping members 51, 51 carried by the lower ends 45, 45 of the suction tubes 44, 44 . A hot wire cutter 60 is positioned between the needle cylinder 10 and the clamping members 51, 51 and yarn lifting members 75, 75 are provided for engaging and raising a yarn moved to inactive position into engage ment with the hot wire cutter 60 .
