# A vehicle suspension system.

## Abstract
A suspension damper has a piston 20 slidable in a cylinder 10 containing fluid. A compressible gas space 45 is provided in one end of the cylinder. To permit piston movement valve controlled passages 54 provide differential resistance in opposite directions of movement and an enlongated slot 51 provides a passage without valve control and the cross section of the slot 51 is selected to vary along its length to provide variable rate damping.
