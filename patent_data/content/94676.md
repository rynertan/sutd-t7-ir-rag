# Optical system for camera tube.

## Abstract
A spatial frequency filter apparatus for suppressing spurious signals generated in an optical system for a television camera incorporating a color encoding filter includes two filter elements 1 and 2 for filtering natural light introduced through lens system 11 in both horizontal and vertical directions and an optical plate such as a quarter wavelength plate 3 or a rotatory polarization plate 13 interposed between the two filter elements 1 and 2 . By causing natural light to transmit through the two filter elements 1 and 2 and the octical plate 3 or 13 before being introduced to a color encoding filter 12 , the spurious signals are suppressed, whereby false color which may otherwise make appearance at the contours of image picked up by the camera tube can be significantly reduced.
