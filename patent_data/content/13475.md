# Apparatus for supplying fluid to a plurality of mechanisms.

## Abstract
A problem with prior apparatus is the need for a plurality of separate apparatuses to supply the controlled members. The invention solves this problem through the use of a single valve assembly 25 that controls the supply of pressurized fluid from a fluid source to first 16 , second 30 and third 34 controlled members, in which the single valve assembly 25 has a first relief valve segment 46 to relieve the pressure of fluid flowing from the source to the third controlled member 34 a second relief valve segment 100 to relieve the pressure of fluid relieved by the first relief valve segment 46 , and a third valve segment 138 to direct the fluid relieved by the first relief valve segment 46 to the first 16 and second 30 controlled members. A movable lever 26 is connected to the third valve segment 138 to shift this valve segment 138 and control the direction of the fluid. The invention is used princi pally in hydraulic circuits for earthworking vehicles to actuate a plurality of controlled members including a flywheel clutch 16 and clutch brake 30 , and steering clutches and vehicle brakes 34 .
