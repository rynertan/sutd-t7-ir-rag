# BIDIRECTIONAL ADAPTIVE VOICE FREQUENCY REPEATER

## Abstract
A high pass filter 117 or 123 is employed to shape the low frequency input characteristic to a bidirectional repeater including echo cancelers 114 115 . This frequency shaping eliminates excessive low frequency signal components from being supplied to the echo cancelers. Consequently, the number of taps, i.e., Figure 2, 216 0 216 N amplitude coefficients, required in the echo cancelers 114, 115 is minimized.
