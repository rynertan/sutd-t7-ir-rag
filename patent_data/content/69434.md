# Apparatus for refining molten metal.

## Abstract
In an apparatus for refining molten metal comprising combination a a vessel having an insulated cover 16 , at least one inlet zone and at least one outlet zone, and at least one refining compartment connected thereto and b one rotating gas distributing device disposed in each refining compartment, said device comprising i a shaft passing through the cover 16 and having drive means at its upper end located above the cover outside of the compart ment and a rotor fixedly attached to its lower end located below the cover inside of the compartment and ii a hollow stator 13 surrounding said shaft and fixedly attached to said vessel, the stator and shaft having a common hypothetical axis 17 , said stator having an upper portion and a lower portion, the upper portion comprised of a corrosion resistant metal and the lower portion 22 comprised of graphite, the upper portion being connected to the lower portion by a corrosion resistant metal graphite threaded joint, the cover being at least about 12,7 cm thick in the vicinity of the stator, the improvement comprising A providing a joint which comprises a threaded male graphite piece 25 having a shoulder 26 preceding the threads and a threaded female corrosion resistant metal piece 19 , the female piece being seated against the shoulder of the male piece and the cross sectional area of the female piece, as measured immediately adjacent to the shoulder, being in the range of about 30 percent to about 50 percent of the cross sectional area of the unthreaded section of the graphite portion 22 as measured immediately adjacent to the shoulder B providing an annular passage 23 in the unthreaded section 20 of the corrosion resistant metal portion through which a cooling gas can be passed, at least part of said passage being located perpendicular to the axis and proxi mate to the joint at a distance D therefrom about equal to the thickness E of the wall of the female piece in which the threads are cut and having an effective cooled area of at least about 70 percent of the cross sectional area of the un threaded section of the graphite portion 22 as measured immediately adjacent to the shoulder C establishing a ratio of i the distance B from the side of the cover 16 adjacent to the refining compartment to the side of the joint closest to the cover to ii the thickness C of the cover, said ratio being greater than unity and D establishing a ratio of i the distance A from the surface of the annular passage 23 closest to the shoulder 26 to the shoulder to ii the distance B from the side of the cover 16 adjacent to the refining compartment to the side of the joint closest to the cover, said ratio being no greater than about 0.35 1.
