## Description
NON PNEUMATIC BICYCLE TIRERELATED PATENTS U.S. Patent 1,169,984 is directed to a nonpneumatic elastic wheel tire for bicycles and automobiles.The tire is made of rubber or a rubber like material and has an internal hollow space between the tire and the wheel rim on which it is placed this space may be air filled or filled with, for example, a compressible elastic material. U.S. Patent 956,928 discloses a pneumatic tire with a ring member positioned in the outer central groove of a tread band, the latter being held to the intermediate tire portion cover by compression this tread band is interchangeable. U.S. Patent 4,127,166 is directed to a molded non pneumatic bicycle tire made from a urethane elastomer this tire is one requiring the use of a bonding cement for bonding the tire to the wheel rim. U.S. Patent 1,434,742 discloses solid tire retaining means for wheels said tire is one which has a central wire core member s5 as shown in Fig. 3 it is identified in Column 2 as the usual wire 15 which extends entirely around the tire. U.S. Patent 3,126,040, is directed to a pneumatic tire with anti skid elements anchored to the center tread portion by means of a pair of inextensible tread rings. U.S. Patent 2,996,040 is directed to a high speed pneumatic tire wherein undesirable movement of portions of the tire tread, sidewall and body is prevented by a constricting annular member extending, in a slot therefore, circumferentially about the center portion of the tire tread. An effective constricting member is disclosed to be one from plies produced by winding continuous twisted wire cord into generally parallel convolutions and surrounding the wire with a rubbery substance, followed by vulcanization to unit the wires, the rubbery substance and the tire into a unit.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Heretofore, pneumatic bicycle tires have been made of several components, fabric plies, tread, sidewalls and rim beads. The components are assembled manually on a special tire building machine and subsequently vulcanized in a curing press. The completed tire is mounted on a bicycle wheel rim and inflated by an inner tube that secures the tire on the rim. A malfunction of any one component causes tire failure. This known tire construction method is relatively expensive, particularly in terms of labor and equipment in addition, tire andlor tube repair requires a skilled pair of hands. Adequate pressure must be maintained in the tire.DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Any appropriate, rubber, elastomer, plastic or blend thereof capable of being extruded through a conventional extruder and die can be utilized to produce my uniquely designed bicycle tire which is non pneumatic. My tire can be cut to measurement from a roll thereof and its design eliminates the need for adhesive bonding and or splicing of the ends. Furthermore, adhesive bonding to the wheel rim is not needed as I achieve a friction fit there, and where the cut ends meet. The tread slot of controlled depth is the key feature of my unique tire design into this slot, which is at a depth below that of the tread, is inserted an annular retainer means which can be, for example, synthetic fiber or steel wire which can be present in the tire often cutting to the required length and then snapped onto the wheel rim. As an alternative, the tire can be positioned onto the wheel rim and the annular retainer means then positioned therein. Should the tire grow during extended use it can readily be cut back to its original length and then be repositioned on the rim with, for example, a butt splice. The tire cavity can be filled with known foams or elastomeric materials.The use of an adhesive to bond the butt splice and or tire to the wheel rim is not necessary my improved tire results in a friction fit once the annular retaining means is combined with said tire and wheel rim.DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING In the drawing, 10 is the tire, 12 is the wheel rim on which the tire 10 is placed 14 is the annular retainer means which is positioned in slot 16 to maintain said tire in appropriate contact with said wheel rim.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION An extrudable rubber, plastic, elastomer or blends of each are extruded through a conventional extruder, for example, one with a screw of 150 mm 6 diameter e quipped with a die of predetermined dimensions to result in a tire cross section as herein described and claimed. An indefinite length of tire body material is extruded in a continuous operation the tire body can then be wound onto a drum and then cured in an autoclave under steam pressure and an appropriate temperature to cure the tire body uniformly. The annular retainer can be made of any known material capable of carrying tension. It can, for example, be made from steel wire or synthetic fiber such as Nylon 6, aramid, polyester, etc. This retainer can be prepositioned in the central tread slot prior to snapping the tire onto the wheel rim or it can be positioned after the tire is fitted onto the wheel rim.The need for splicing or adhesive bonding is eliminated. Extrudable rubber like materials which can be utilized to produce my improved non pneamatic bicycle tire include, for example, any one or blends of one or more of the extrudable plastic materials set forth on pages 751 to 757 of the publication The International Plastics Selector 1977 Extruding and Molding Grades by Cordura Publication, Inc. desk top data bank Specific extrudable plastic materials which can be utilized are, for example, polystyrene, nylon, polyethylene, polypropylene and polyvinylchloride PVC . Extrudable non plastic elastomeric materials which can be utilized to prepare my improved tire include extrudable elastomeric materials acrylic rubber, butadiene rubber, natural rubber, brominated isobutylene isoprene, chlorinated isobutylene isoprene, butyl rubber, butadiene styrene vinyl pyridine, chlorinated polyethylene, chloroprene, chlorosulfonated polyethylene, epichlorohydrin rubber, ethylene propylene diene, fluorocarbon rubbers, halogenated rubbers, butadiene acrylonitirle copolymers, polyisoprene, polysulfide rubber, silicone rubber, styrene butadiene and urethane rubbers. The following example is representative and illustrates the formation of my unique bicycle tire design and its adaptation to a bicycle tire wheel. EXAMPLE A natural rubber based conventional off theroad tread stock containing ISAF carbon black and sulfur, was extruded through a conventional extruder and die to give the tire cross section herein described and set forth in the drawing. The extruder had a screw of 150 mm 6 diameter and was equipped with a die of the proper dimensions. The extruded tire was wound onto a drum and moved into an autoclave for curing. A steam pressure of approximately 3 atu 50 psi and a temperature of 140 C was maintained in the autoclave for minutes and resulted in a uniformally vulcanized tire body. The tire body was then cut to length and placed onto a bicycle wheel. Rope was utilized as the annular retainer this rope was the only means utilized to secure said tire to said wheel rim. The ends of the tire body were simply butt spliced. The preceding example can be varied within the context of my total specification disclosure. Known equivalent tire tread stock compositions and annular retaining means can be substituted therein to achieve essentially the same results. The particular combination selected is not critical. It is understood that one skilled in the art can readily compound, with a minimum of routine experimentation and or optimization, a wide variety of extrudable rubber, plastic or elastomer compositions which can be utilized in the practice of my invention. The particular extrudable elastomeric or plastic material and or composition containing said material selected is not critical my improvement feature, however, is.
