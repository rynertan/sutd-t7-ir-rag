# SMALL BEAD AUTO EXHAUST CATALYST

## Abstract
Alumina particle catalysts which can be used for auto emission control and especially as a three way catalyst have increased performance. The alumina particles which are pref erably spheroids have a low compacted bulk density of about 20 to 36 pounds per cubic foot and a smaller size on the order of less than 2.6 mm for the preferred spheroids. The spheroid embodiment also has a high crush strength. Because of the small size the ratio of the geometric surface area to the bulk volume GSA BV is at least about 14cm² cm³. These alumina particles are impregnated with a catalytically effective amount of one or more platinum group metals such as platinum, palladium or rhodium and additional promoters can also be added. In the preferred embodiment the alumina particles have a GSA BV ratio of from about 17 to 25 cm² cm³ for substantially improved performance.
