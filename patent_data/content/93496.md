## Description
This invention relates to a method and apparatus for processing similar workpieces of varying shape, points of contour and dimension. BACKGROUND OF THE PRESENT INVENTION The automated production lines of the prior art handle workpieces which are the same shape, contour and dimension.Edges, holes, lugs, keys, depressions, detents, etc., are on the workpieces to provide interlocking positioning and or gripping means so that identical workpieces may be identically located at work stations. The lines are equipped with sensors which reject workpieces from the line which are not the same shape and dimension, and which vary in position and grip means. In other words, the prior art does not tolerate varying shape, contour and dimension whereas the present invention provides facility for handling workpieces of varying shape, contour and dimension. SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION An elongated frame has opposite sides and multiple stations such as three. Spaced and paired stubs are welded on the top of the sides of the frame. Drop loop straps lie between paired stubs forming workpiece receiving stirrups at each station after the first station. A platen lies within the opposite sides of the frame below the stubs and all stations. Means are provided to raise and lower the platen relative to the stirrups.A shuttle is slidably located on the platen. The shuttle as shown extends between two stations of the frame. Upstanding paired leqs are welded on the shuttle of such lenqth as to be located with their upper ends well above the stubs on the frame when raised by the platen. The leqs lie inwardly of the stubs to by pass the stubs. Drop loop straps lie between the tops of paired leqs forminq slinqs. The platen raises and lowers the shuttle. Means are provided to move the shuttle bi directionally lenqthwise on the platen relative to the stations of the frame in the raised and lowered positions of the platen. Workpieces are loaded in the slinqs of the shuttle at station I. Upward movement of the shuttle by the platen raises the bottom of the slinqs above the tops of the stubs and stirrups. Outward lenqthwise movement of the shuttle moves the slinqs and workpieces over the stirrups of the frame to which they are indexed. Downward movement of the shuttle moves the workpieces into contact with the stirrups at station II which now supports the workpieces. Further downward movement of the shuttle clears the leqs and slinqs of the stubs, stirrups and workpieces. The shuttle is then retracted to its initial position where it is reloaded with workpieces. Durinq the retraction and reloadinq, work is performed on the workpieces at station II. There are now workpieces at stations I and II but none at station III. The shuttle is now raised and lifts the worked on workpieces at station II above the stirrups and stubs and lifts the reloaded workpieces at station I. The shuttle is moved lenqthwise to the positions of stations II and III. The shuttle is then lowered depositinq the worked on workpieces from stationII in the stirrups of station III and the reloaded workpieces from station I in the stirrups of station II. Durinq passaqe between stations II and III the workpieces from station II have work performed on them. The shuttle is now lowered by the platen and returned to the reloadinq station and reloaded. Durinq the return and reload, work on the workpieces is performed at stations II and III and the processed workpieces at station III ejected from the stirrups at station III but retained at stationII.The operation described is continuous dependent only upon the workpieces being loaded and located at station I. Shutes and other transfer means receive the off fall from the workpieces and convey them from the apparatus. The frame may be any lenqth and have any number of stations with the shuttle being extended to include sufficient stations to serve all the stations of the frame. Several frames and shuttles may be used, and transfers used between them. More than one shuttle may be used in one frame. The Controls A lamp at station I projects a line of liqht downwardly at a selected point to indicate the proper position of the workpiece. The loader aliqns each workpiece on the slinqs at station I so that the common reference point of the workpiece lies on the projected line of light and presses a button which activates the shuttle to move the workpieces to station II at the initiation of processinq which also activates all stations. One or more cameras are positioned at a station. A camera takes a measured image of the workpiece and feeds the dimensions, contours and shape of the workpiece relative to the reference point to video processing components where the image is converted to data which are fed to image processing. System decision processinq components receive the processed data and in conjunction with memories, stored programs and software programs produce signals that indicate the portions of the workpiece upon which the tools will work, to what extent, and to one or more actions by the tools. These signals are fed to servos which control the movement of the tools relative to the workpieces. As shown at station II, two cameras and two servos lie on either side of station II for performing work on both ends of the workpiece at the same time.In the meantime, the shuttle has relocated to station I and has been reloaded with workpieces. The operator presses the button and the shuttle moves the workpieces from station II to station III and the newly loaded workpieces to station II. During the passage of the workpieces from station to station III they pass by a tool which performs further work prior to their being deposited at station III. Work proceeds at stationII as above set forth. A camera at station III scans the workpieces received from station II and feeds the measured image to the control system previously described and the servo at station III activates and controls the tool to perform the desired work at station III similar to station II. The finished or semi finished workpieces are shunted out of station III clearinq it for the next workpieces to be received from station II. The mthod and apparatus, their function and operation, and the unforeseen result of the operation of the invention will be more clearly understoou trorn the later detailed description taken in conjunction with the attached schematic drawings now described.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATED EMBODIMENTS Referring now to the drawinqs where like reference numerals refer to like and correspondinq parts throuqhout the several views, the method and apparatus of the invention for processing workpieces of varying contour, shape and dimension in sequential operations comprise a fram 20 extending lenqthwise a distance to include a desired plurality of work stAtions such as stations I, II and III, Figures 1 and 2. Upstandinqs stubs 21 are welded on the frame 20 and are paired with one another.Stirrups 22 hanq between paired stubs 21 for receivinq and supportinq workpieces or objects 84 and 85. A key point 32 is established for the system such as a line on the frame 20. A platen 24 lies in the frame 20. A shuttle 25 rests on the platen 24. Paired leqs 26 extend upwardly on the shuttle 25. Slings 27 hanq down between paired legs 26 for receivinq and supportinq workpieces 84, 85 at station I and transferring workpieces 84, 85 to and between stations II and III. A lamp 30 at station I projects a line of light 31 on the key point 32 and on the workpieces 84, 85 in station I. The attendent aligns the common reference point 32 of the workpieces 84, 85 under the line of light 31 which properly locates the workpieces 84, 85 relative to the key point 32. Cameras 33, 34 and 35 at stations II andIII scan the workpieces 84, AS. A monitor 29 co acts with the cameras 33, 34 and 35 relative to the system under control 28,Fig. 3. Tools 36, 37, 38 and 39 are located in stations 11 andIII. Servos 40, 41 and 42 lie in stations II and III to move and position the tools 36, 37 and 39 respectively. Tool 38 is fixed on a base 43. Each servo 40, 41 and 42 has angularly and radially moving supports 44, 45 and 46 respectively for compound universal positioning of the tools 36, 37 and 39. The servos 40, 41 and 42 are video, image and computer controlled. Hydraulic cylinders 47 and 48 raise and lower the platen 24 and the shuttle 25 and workpieces 84, 85. A hydraulic cylinder 49 advances and retracts the shuttle 25 between stations I, II and III. The cameras 33, 34 and 35, Fig. 3, are charqe injection devices cud and qenerate the visual scene data from which macro scene characteristics or features are extracted, processed and analyzed accordinq to a pre established program. The cameras 33, 34 and 35 contain a sensor which is a mosaic of about 250 by 250 solid state liqht sensitive picture elements pixels arranged in columns and rows which are electronically scanned to generate a television like image. This results in a spatially stable precise geometry which gives the effect oe superimposing a fixed, repeatable measurement qrid over objects in the camera field of view.The camera imaqes are fed to video input processing VIP . VIP 50 has a camera image interface 51 CII , an image plane memory IPM 52, and image control and display ICD 53.These elements process pixel based data steerinq, formating, thresholdinq, multiflexinq and storage. Incoming 8 bit digetized video from each camera is thresholded into a l bit binary black and white siqnal for further processing, they may be software controlled, and analoq camera data may be presented on a T.V. monitor 54. The image plane memory ISM 52 acts as a data rate converter allowing access by the image data processing function to occur at rates varying from carnera video rates. VIP feeds its output to multi bus 55. VIP also feeds its output to image data processinq IDP 60. IDP 60 has a corner point encoder CPE 61, first in first out memory FIFO 62, a feature extractor sorter FES 63 and a feature memory 64. CPX produces signals equivalent to the dimensions, contours and shape of each workpiece 84, 85 and feeds the signals to FIVE. FES extracts the dimensional features of each workpiece 84, 85 and sorts them. A feature memory 64 retains the sorted images throughout the travel of workpieces 84, 85 at stations II and III and any downstream stations.Downstream stations are afforded by lengthening the frame 20, the platen 24 and the shuttle 25 with cameras and servos attendinq the downstream stations. System Decision Processing 70 includes CPU 71, sssociated core memory modules 72, and ROM system execution ssoftware elements 73, all of which are connected to the multi bus 55. CPU 71 is connected to the keyboard display terminal 54 or a T.V. monotor 54. An input output module 80 is connected to the multi bus 55, between the system under control 28 and CPU 71, and to a cassette tape recorder 81. The illustrated workpieces are split hog carcasses 84 and 85 which are located at station I on the line of light 31 on the point common to all the carcasses 84 and 85 I.e. the juncture between the second and third ribs. The head has been removed prior to splittinq. The shoulder 86 and front legs 87 lie outside the slinqs 27 and stirrups 22 at one side of the shuttle 25 and the hind leqs 88 and hams 89 lie outside the slinqs 27 and stirrups 22 on the other side of the shuttle 25. The dimensions of the front feet 90 and hocks 91, and of the rear feet 92 and hocks 93 are determined at station II by the system. Dependent on software control, the front feet 90 and the rear feet 92 are cut off by the tools 36 and 37 respectively which are meat and bone saws. Then the tools 36 and 37 make a second cut off of the front hocks or picnics 91 and the rear hocks 93. If it is desired to cut off the feet and hocks toqether, the tools 36 and 37 make a single cut at the hocks 91 and 93 leaving the feet 90 and 92 attached to the hocks 91 and 93 respectively. when the shuttle 25 moves the remainder of the carcasses 84 and 85 from station II to station III they pass by saw tool 38 which cuts off the shoulder 86 Upon arrivinq at station III true hams 89 are cut off by saw tool 39 after dimensions, contours and shape of the hams have been determined at station III by the system. VIDEO PROCESSING The Video Processing or input control 50 section performs several preprocessinq functions involvinq hiqh speed pixel based data steering, formatin,thresholdinq, multiplexing and storaqe. Each camera 33, 34 and 35 is individually serviced at a rate determined by product flow or object movement.Incoming 8 bit digitized video from each camera head is thresholded into a 1 bit binary black and white signal for further processinq. The threshold levels can be set aynamically on a fratne to frame basis, for each camera source under software control. Gray scale diqitized video is used for system setup, and analog can era video can be presented on a conventional closed circuit T.V. monitor, not shown. The Imaqe Plane Memory IPM is a 256x256xss bit dynamic random access memory. Normally, it is partitioned into four 4 256x25hx2 bit paxes . The first bit in each page is used to store thresholded camera scene data, whilethe second bit is used for computer qenerated overlay data such as qraphics or alpha numerics. The IP 1 50 acts as a data rate converter, allowinq access by the Image Data Processing function 60 or the CPU 71 to occur at rates other than camera video rates. The controlling of multi source picture takinq, the routinq of scenes into and out of the IPM 50 and keeping track of pictures to be processed is performed by the micro processor located within the image control and display function 53. IMAGE PROCESSING The Imaqe Data Processing section 60 transforms the video pixel data base into a high level, object macro feature data base. Thresholded camera scene, stored in the IPM 50 is scanned to locate edges, contours and boundaries of transition between black and white data and corner points where the direction of an edge changes. The stored data is then automatically processed into individual item files. The feature extractor 63 analyzes these item files and extracts key atomic features or the macro characteristics of each item. Atomic features include area centroid location, rectilinear bounding box or dimensions, and parts, shapes and contouro. As a function of the application program, the CPU 71 will request the feature extractor to perform additional, extended feature extraction tasks such as the computation of caliper or ruler distance between points, intersections oE a line with an item part, perimeter of an item, maximum radiums of an item, etc.. The mirro processor 70 utilizes these extended feature results, along witll the atomics in the data base, to perform the decision processinq within the application program. DECISION PROCESSING Final decision processinq is accomplished by the primary CPU 71 with associated memory modules 72. Decision processing is performed by the execution of user application proqrams which are stored in a 16K or 32K byte core memory plane 7 to ensure non volatility. User input can be keyboard terminal 54, cassette tape 81 PhO core 72 interchange or a host computer. Outputs include simple so no go indication, accurate dimensional, shape an contour measurement data, various control signals, and data loqqinq. While the disclosed and described method and apparatus, sinqly and in combination, ilustrnte the invention, it will be understood that other embodiments may lie within the scope of the appended claims which define the protection of the invention.
