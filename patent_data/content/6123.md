# A pteridine derivative and a process for the preparation of 10 deazaaminopterin and its derivatives from the pteridine derivative.

## Abstract
There is disclosed an improved process for the preparation of 10 deazaaminopterin and related compounds. In accordance with this process, 6 bromomethyl 2,4 pteridinediamine hydrobromide is reacted with triphenyl phosphine to form a phosphonium salt which is then treated with a base to yield the corresponding ylid 2,4 diamino 6 pteridinyl methylenetriphenylphosphorane. This compound is reacted with an aromatic aldehyde such as diethyl 4 formylbenzoyl L glutamate to form an olefin which is then reduced catalytically to the tetrahydro derivative of the desired product. Oxidation of the tetrahydro derivative is accomplished with hydrogen peroxide.
