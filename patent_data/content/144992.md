# APPARATUS FOR DISPENSING VOLATILE SUBSTANCES

## Abstract
An apparatus is provided for dispensing of volatile subst ances which includes a housing, and at least one piezoelec tric blower 14 . Each blower 14 includes a piezoelectric element 18 having a first end 19 mounted to the housing and a second end 22 free, and a generally planar impellar blade 8 connected to the free end 22 to the piezoelectric element 18 and having its distal end 8a unconstrained by the housing. A frame is attached to, or provided as an integral part of, the housing and is located in proximity to the distal end 8a of the blade 8 . The frame is adapted to detachably mount a replaceable substrate cartridge contain ing a volatile substance. In use, a voltage is applied to the piezoelectric element 18 for oscillating its free end 22 perpendicular to its plane at or close to resonance and propagating a traveling wave along each blade 8 to generate and shed vortices at the distal end 8a of the blade 8 which contact the substrate cartridge, thereby dispensing the volatile substance to the surrounding atmosphere.
