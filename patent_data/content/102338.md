# DEVICE FOR UNDERWATER MISSILES FOR USE AGAINST SUBMERGED SUBMARINES

## Abstract
A device for underwater missiles for use against sub merged submarines, said missiles including a housing 1 having a front portion, intended to contact the outside surface of a submarine. According to the invention, a tubular ring member 6 is rotatably attached to the front portion of the housing 1 , said ring member 6 being arranged to take up a rotary movement in relation to the housing 1 when contacting the outside surface of a submarine. In order to facilitate rapid acceleration of the ring member 6 into said rotary movement, the ring member 6 is attached to the housing 1 by means of a ball bearing joint 7 or any other known low frictional rotary joint or connection, and the mass of the ring member 6 is also considerably smaller than the total mass of the missile. The outer surface s of the ring member 6 is are also preferably arranged with means intended to increase the frictional contact between the ring member 6 and the outer surface of a submarine on impact, e.g. a layer or coating of a meterial having a high frictional coefficient, an irregular surface, or means directed outwardly from the ring member 6 .
