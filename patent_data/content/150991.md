# Video display apparatus.

## Abstract
A video display apparatus includes a display device including a plurality of display cells 201 to 224. etc. ar ranged in an X Y matrix form, a video signal source 101 to 106 for supplying a digital video signal, a pulse width modulator 131 to 134, etc. connected to the video signal source 101 to 106 for deriving a pulse width modulated signal corresponding to the brightness level of the digital video signal. The pulse width modulator 101 to 106 includes a counter 133 supplied with the digital video signal as a datum signal and a clock signal generator 501 for supplying clock signal to the counter 133 , and a signal supplying circuit 113 connected to the pulse width modulator 101 to 106 for supplying the pulse width modulated signal to the display device and reproducing a picture thereon. A control circuit 116 is connected to the clock signal generator 501 for changing the frequency of the clock signal supplied to the counter 133 to control the brightness of the picture re produced on the display device.
