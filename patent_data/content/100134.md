# Combustion apparatus and method.

## Abstract
Combustion apparatus for a gas turbine engine for air craft propulsion has a plenum chamber 56 supplied with air from a compressor at 58 and arranged to supply air to a com bustion passage 54 through selectively variable openings 64 in an end wall 46 of the combustion passage. Exhausted air is discharged to a turbine at 52 . The passage 54 is di vided into a pilot combustion zone 54a and a main combus tion zone 54b by an annular inward projection 96 opposite a circumferential ring of fuel nozzles 90 capable of selectively supplying fuel at 106 to the pilot zone and at 110 to the main zone. There are also passages for combustion air to the pilot zone at 44 and for secondary air downstream of the main zone at 102 and 104 . A barrier region defined between the projection 96 and the nozzles 90 restricts interaction be tween the two combustion zones so that for example loss of flame in the main zone may not be reflected by loss of flame in the pilot zone.
