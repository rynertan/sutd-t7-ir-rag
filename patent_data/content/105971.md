# RECEPTACLE TAMPERING SENSOR AND INDICATOR AND METHOD THEREFOR

## Abstract
A reliable and low cost sensor and indicator 12 to be associated with a receptacle 1 filled with dosage forms e.g. over the counter drugs and a corresponding method by which to quickly and easily warn a consumer that an un authorized tampering may have occurred to the receptacle and the contents 2 thereof. The tampering indicator is pre ferably either attached to or integrally formed with a seal 36 at the underside of a removable receptacle cap 8 . The tampering indicator comprises a fluid filled reservoir 14 , a tab 10 having a chemically treated indicator strip 22 thereat, and a fluid path 18, 24 by which fluid from the res ervoir communicates with the indicator strip. The indicator is engaged by the rim 40 of the receptacle when the cap is positioned thereover by the dosage form manufacturer. Ac cordingly, fluid is forced from the reservoir into the fluid path. However, the fluid path is initially blocked at the en gagement thereof by the receptacle rim. The tab and the in dicator strip thereof extend outwardly from beneath the cap of the receptacle for providing the consumer with a visual indication in the event of an unauthorized removal of the cap from the receptacle. That is, should the cap be removed from the receptacle and the fluid path be moved out of en gagement with the receptacle rim prior to a purchase by a consumer, whereupon tampering with the contents of the receptacle might occur, fluid from the supply thereof is per mitted to flow via the fluid path to the chemically treated strip, whereby to cause the strip to assume a characteristic color that is indicative of a possible tampering condition.
