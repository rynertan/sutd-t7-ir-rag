# PROCESS OF CONTINUOUSLY TREATING AN ALLOY MELT

## Abstract
A process for continuously treating a ferrous or non ferrous alloy melt being transferred through a plurality of interconnected zones. The treatment includes lowering the carbon content of the melt in a first treatment zone lowering the residual oxygen content of the melt in a second treatment zone lowering the sulfur content in a third treatment zone lowering the dissolved gas content of the desulfurized melt in a fourth treatment zone and removing the remaining particulates and films from the melt in a fifth treatment zone.
