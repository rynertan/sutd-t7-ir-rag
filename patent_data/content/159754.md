# SOLUBLE COFFEE COMPOSITION

## Abstract
A coffee extract or concentrate and a soluble coffee which are similar to roast and ground coffee solubles in composition of moderately volatile flavor components are disclosed. The soluble coffee composition also contains less of the off flavor compo nents normally found in high quantities in conventional instant coffees. The coffees are characterized by high pyrazines deriva tive content and low content of furfural. This soluble coffee composition can be aromatized for use as a premium soluble coffee product. Alternatively, it is compatible for mixing with conventional roast and ground coffee in single and multiple serving brewing articles, such as coffee bags.
