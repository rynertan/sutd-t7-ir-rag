## Description
This invention relates to a driver circuit for a liquid crystal display that can be employed in a liquid crystal television receiver or the like. In recent years, pocket sized liquid crystal television receivers have been available. In such a liquid crystal television receiver, each of switching elements of FET s provided at respective elemental liquid crystal cell arranged in a matrix shape on a liquid crystal panel is supplied with an input image signal voltage and a switching signal and is connected with one electrode of each liquid crystal cell. A common electrode commonly connected with the opposite electrode of each liquid crystal cell is supplied with a common voltage. Since the liquid crystal panel must be A.C. driven, the input signal voltage and common voltage are inverted in their polarity every one field. Referring now to the drawings, an example of the prior art driver circuit for liquid crystal displays will be explained below. In Fig. 1 showing a matrix type liquid crystal display, a liquid crystal cell 1, storage capacitor 2 and field effect transistor FET 3 that serves as a switching element constitute a liquid crystal display element for displaying each picture element pixel . An X electrode 4 is supplied with a switching signal and a Y electrode 5 is supplied with an image signal. A common electrode 6 provided on an opposite substrate is supplied with a common voltage. In Fig. 2 showing one display element in detail, 1 to 6 denote like parts in Fig. 1 and 7, 8 and 9 denote capacitances C Fig. 4 shows a circuit for inverting the image signal and the common voltage. In Fig. 4, 12 denotes an input terminal of a switching signal V The above mentioned point art arrangement suffers from the following disadvantages. Since, as shown in Fig. 2, inter electrode capacitances C From DE A 32 12 863 is known a driver circuit for A.C. driving the liquid crystal cells of a liquid crystal display which are arranged in a matrix shape. Each of the liquid crystal cells has one electrode connected to a switching element driven by an input image signal voltage and a switching signal, and an opposite electrode, the opposite electrodes of the liquid crystal cells of groups of three lines being connected together for supplying with a common voltage. For A.C. driving the liquid crystal display, the input image signal voltage and the common voltage each is polarity inverted with the field period by respective inversion means. Also in this known display, the level of the input image signal voltage may be subjected to variations due to different inter electrode capacitances or due to variations in the fabrication process, as discussed above with reference to Figures 2 and 3, such that the difference between the image signal voltage and the common voltage may fluctuate among the respective fields. Also from US A 4 395 708 is known a liquid crystal display including a driver circuit in which, for A.C. driving the liquid crystal display, the image signal voltage is polarity inverted with the field period by level shifting alternating ranges of the signal, so that the signal has voltage levels symmetrically disposed above and below a predetermined reference level. However, also in this known display the voltage difference between the image signal voltage and the common voltage at the electrodes of the liquid crystal cells may vary due to the above mentioned inter electrode capacitances or variations in the fabrication process and result in fluctuations among the respective fields. Therefore, it is the object of the present invention to provide a driver circuit for a liquid crystal display which easily can adjust the image signal voltage and the common voltage in a predetermined relation. In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a driver circuit for A.C. driving a liquid crystal display cell comprising signal voltage inversion means for polarity inverting, periodically with a given period, a display signal voltage to be applied to one electrode of the liquid crystal display cell and common voltage inversion means for polarity inverting a common voltage to be applied to an opposite common electrode thereof, so that the common voltage is level shifted, periodically with the given period, in different directions in each alternate said period, comprising D.C. level shifting means for varying D.C. voltage level of at least one of the polarity inverted signal voltage and common voltage periodically with the given period by a same amount in a same direction in each period. In this way, where the relation between the signal voltage and the common voltage deviates from a predetermined relation as in the prior art arrangement, they can be correctly adjusted so as to be in the predetermined relation by varying at least one of them in their D.C. level. Thus, the liquid crystal panel can be correctly A.C. driven so that its performance will be greatly improved and its life will be lengthened. The above and other objects, features and advantages of this invention will be more clearly understood from the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. Fig. 1 shows a schematic arrangement of a matrix type liquid crystal display. Fig. 2 shows a schematic arrangement of one liquid crystal display element for displaying each picture element in the matrix type liquid crystal display. Fig. 3 is a waveform chart of voltages applied to one electrode of a liquid crystal cell. Fig. 4 is a circuit diagram of a driver circuit for the prior art liquid crystal display. Fig. 5 is a circuit diagram of a driver circuit for a liquid crystal display according to one embodiment of this invention. Fig. 6 is a circuit diagram of a driver circuit for a liquid crystal display according to another embodiment of this invention. In Fig. 5 showing one embodiment of a driver circuit for a liquid crystal display, 12 denotes an input terminal of a switching signal V Therefore, by varying the current I₀ from the constant current source, the polarity inverted image signal can be varied in its D.C. level by the same amount in the same direction in each field. In this way, in accordance with this embodiment, in the case where the polarity inverted image signal to be applied to one electrode of a liquid crystal cell is deviated low in its D.C. level as shown, for example, by a one dotted chain line in Fig. 3, the output image signal can be elevated in its D.C. level to a predetermined level as shown by the image signal 10 of a solid line in Fig. 3 by controlling the D.C. current flowing through transistor Q₂ of the constant current source so as to be decreased, thereby permitting the liquid crystal cell to be A.C. driven in a predetermined voltage relation. Another embodiment of this invention will be explained with reference to Fig. 6. In Fig. 6, 12 denotes an input terminal of a V Therefore, by varying the value of V In this way, in accordance with this embodiment, the common voltage can be varied with the difference between its both levels maintained constant so that the relation between the image signal and the common voltage can be always correctly adjusted. For example, in the case where the image signal level is deviated low with respect to the common voltage as shown by a one dotted chain line in Fig. 3, the D.C. level of the common voltage can be reduced to a predetermined level by controlling the variable resistor VR₂ so as to be increased, thereby permitting the liquid crystal cell to be A.C. driven in a predetermined voltage relation.
