# Parachute.

## Abstract
A tethered parachute has lead weights 4 distributed along a portion of the periphery of its canopy 1 for stabilizing the parachute.

## Claims
CLAIMS 1. A parachute having a canopy of which a portion of the periphery is weighted with a distributed weight. 2. A parachute as claimed in claim 1 wherein the weighted portion of the periphery has an extent of between 300 and 900 of arc. 3. A parachute as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2 wherein the distributed weight consists of evenly distributed weights. 4. A parachute as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the distributed weight consists of lead weights sown into a hem at the periphery of the canopy.

## Description
PARACFIUTE The invention relates to a parachute of a kind intended to fly tethered in the manner of a kite. Tethered parachutes which are flown in the wind or towed behind a moving vessel have applications in position marking, supporting various airborne equipment, or target practice, for example. A practical difficulty with tethered parachutes is that they are found to be unstable and unless precautions are taken they will readily plunge to the ground. A suitable precaution is to attach a tail after the manner of a stabilising kite tail. A difficulty with this, however, is that the parachute may be deployed by launching a canister by rocket or explosive charge, the parachute being unfolded from the canister when aloft. A tail easily becomes entangled in the rigging with this arrangement and stabilisation is lost. The invention seeks to provide an improved parachute. According to the invention there is provided a parachute zving a canopy of which a portion of the periphery is weighted with distributed weight. The distributed weight may be achieved by lead weights sewn into a hem at the periphery of the canopy. The proportion of the periphery which is weighted may be up to half namely iSO0 of arc. Preferably, however, the weighted portion is between300 and 900 of arc and in a preferred embodiment is substantially 600 of arc. The invention will further be described with reference to the accompanying drawing, of which the sole figure is a perspective view of a parachute in accordance with the invention. Referring to the drawing there is shown a parachute having a fabric canopy 1, a number of rigging lines 2 and a tethering line 3. The parachute is flown tethered with the remote end of line 3 attached to a point at ground level which may be fixed or on a moving vehicle. The canopy is symmetrical and the periphery is circular. Over 60 0of arc of the periphery there is distributed a series of lead weights 4 which are sewn into the hem of the canopy. The weights are evenly distributed.In flight, the weighted portion will assume the lowest position. In this example the diameter of the parachute is 5m and the total distributed weight of the lead weights is 1i kg.
