# Method for preparing 7,8 dichloro 1,2,3,4 tetrahydroisoquinoline and N chloroethyl , N bromoethyl or N hydroxyethyl 2,3 dichlorobenzylamine intermediate.

## Abstract
A method for preparing 7,8 dichloro 1,2,3,4 tetrahydroisoquinoline comprising heating a N chloro , N bromo or N hydroxyethyl 2,3 dichlorobenzylamine in an aluminum chloride melt at 160 to 210 C. A novel N chloroethyl , N bromoethyl or N hydroxyethyl 2,3 dichlorobenzylamine intermediate is used as starting material for the cyclization.
