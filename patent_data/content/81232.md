## Description
METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR DETECTING TRACK JUMPING POINT IN MAGNETIC RECORDING AND REPRODUCING SYSTEM The present invention relates to a track jumping point detecting method for detecting with accuracy a timing at which magnetic heads move or jump, respectively, to an adjacent record track or to a next adjacent track located by one track away in a magnetic recording and reproducing apparatus such as a video tape recorder hereinafter referred to as VTR . The invention also concerns an apparatus for carrying out the method. In general, in a helical scan type VTR in which at least two rotary magnetic heads having different azimuth angles are employed, various difficulties are encountered in special playback or reproduction modes such as search reproduction, still reproduction and the like. For example, a horizontal skew phenomenon due to discontinuity of the horizontal synchronization and phenomenon of decolorization e.g. disappearance of colors in the PAL system may take place in dependence on magnitude of offset or deviation between adjacent record tracks on a magnetic tape. Besides, noise bands will make appearance on a reproduced picture independent of the deviation.All of these undesirable phenomena occur every time one magnetic head having a predetermined azimuth angle jumps from the track which is being currently reproduced to the track located immediately adjacent thereto or the track located by one track away therefrom in the helical scan type VTR. First of all, these problems will be discussed in some detail below by referring to Figs. 1A, lb, Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 of the accompanying drawings. Fig. 1A illustrates, by way of example, a pattern of record tracks on a magnetic tape and tracing or tracking patterns of magnetic heads in the search reproduction mode. Referring to Fig. 1A, the recording of video information on the record tracks has been made by means of two magnetic heads having azimuth angles different from each other. More specifically, the recording on the tracks A1, A2, A3 and so forth has been made by one magnetic head A having an azimuth angle, while recoding on the tracks B1, B2, B3 and so forth are made by the other magnetic head B having an azimuth angle different from that of the magnetic head A. The magnetic head A is destined to reproduce information recorded on the tracks A1, A2, A3 and so forth, while the magnetic head B serves for reproduction of information recorded on the tracks B1, B2, 33 and so forth.In the case of the example illustrated in Fig. LA, it is assumed that reproduction of information recorded on the tracksB4, B5 and B6 by the magnetic head B is effected in succession to the reproduction of information on the tracks A1, A2 and A3 by the magnetic head A and so on. In this connection, Fig. 2 graphically illustrates at 2a the envelope characteristic of the reproduced output signals of the magnetic heads. As will be seen from the figure, constrictions are produced at every one of so called jumping points at which the magnetic headA, for example, is switched over from the record trackA1 to the track A2. Such constriction means that the corresponding reproduced output signal is at lower level, giving rise to occurrence of a noise band. When the aforementioned deviation is represented by Clur jumping of lines in a number corresponding to 2 aH takes place, which means that there is included in the reproduced signal the horizontal line signal which is excluded from reproduction.As a result, unless 2 aH is an integral multiple of a length E of the television or TV signal corresponding to the single horizontal line as viewed in the longitudinal direction of the record track, the horizontal skew phenomenon will make appearance. Further, when 2 aH is an even multiple of the length HL, the decolorization phenomenon in which the reproduced picture is not colored occurs in the PAL system. As is known, in the PAL system, R Y component of the chrominance signal is phase inverted at every horizontal period. Accordingly, a normal picture can be reproduced only when the components R Y and R Y are regularly alternated upon reproduction. In this connection, if 2aH is an even multiple of K, r the above mentioned regularity can no more be maintained in the reproduced signal, as the result of which color synchronization is disturbed in the associated TV receiver, thereby giving rise to the problem of the decolorization. On the other hand, Fig. 1B illustrates, by way way of example, record trAcks on a magnetic tape together with tracking or tracing pattterns of the magnetic heads in the still reproduction mode. In the case of the illustrated example, it is assumed that the magnetic heads A and B are to pick up the information recorded on the record tracks A3 and B2, respectively, wherein the envelope characteristic of the reproduced output signals is such as illustrated in Fig. 2 at 2b. As can be seen, contriction of the reproduced output signal occurs at a point where the Signal reproduced from the track A3 is switched over to the signal reproduced from the track B2.This transition from the track A3 to the track B2 is also referred to as the jump point, because the reproduction returns to the track B2 from the track A3 by jumping over one track although the reproduction of the trackA3 should be immediately followed by the reproduction of the track B3 in the normal reproduction mode. At this jump point, there occur unwanted phenomena such as appearance of the noise band and the horizontal skew as well as the decolorization in the PAL system, as is in the case of the aforementioned search reproduction mode.Further, the track jcrmping brings about similar problems in the slow reproduction mode as well, although detailed elucidation in this respect is herein omitted. Next, description will be made as to the measures heretofore taken for obviating these difficulties.In the first place, it is known to suppressing the horizontal skew phenomenon which is ascribable to the discontinuity in the horizontal synchronization brought about at the track umping point with the aid of a delay lie circuit.For example, in case 2aH 1.5H where 1H represents a single horizontal period, the discontinuity in the horizontal synchronization corresponding to 1.5H will occur at the track jumping point, giving rise to the appearance of the horizontal skew of 0.5H in the reproduced picture.Accordingly, when the reproduced signal transmitted through the delay line having a delay time of 0.5H is alternately changed over with the reproduced signal which is not transmitted through the delay line at the track jumping point, the jumping over the horizontal line at the track jumping point corresponds to 1H or 2H. In other words, because of the integral multiple of H, the horizontal synchronization can be continued, whereby the horizontal skew phenomenon can be suppressed. There is one prior art method in which. the jump point is detected by detecting the phase deviation of the horizontal synchronizing signal, however this prior art method is disadvantageous in that it can not be adopted for the record tracks where 2 aB is equal to an integral multiple of HL. Next, as a method of protecting the reproduced picture from deterioration in the image quality due to the noise band, it is known, for example, to confine the noise band within the vertical blanking period in the still reproduction mode, to thereby prevent the noise band from making appearance on the reproduced picture. Further, in the search reproduction mode, it is possible to reproduce less uncomfortable image by fixing the noise band at a predetermined position on the reproduced picture, as compared with the case where the noise band is not fixed. In this connection, it should be recalled that the noise band is generated at the track jumping point which is usually detected by detecting the minimum level of the reproduced FM signal according to the prior art method. To this end, a low pass filter or LPF is used for the envelope detection.However, use of the LPF provides a cause for the phase deviation, making it impossible to detect the track jumping point with a reasonable accuracy. Further, as a method of suppressing the phenomenon of decolorization in the PAL system, there can be mentioned a method of exchanging the reproduced chroma signal delayed by 1H and the non delayed reproduced chroma signal at the track jumping point. Fig. 3 shows a typical example of hitherto known apparatus for processing the reproduced chroma signal for the PAL system in which a 900 phase step of a burst signal produced upon the track jumping is detected for determining the track jumping point. InFig. 3, a reference numeral 1 denotes an input terminal for a burst flag pulse signal Pf, 2 denotes an input terminal for a low frequency converted chroma signal having a carrier frequency fL upon being reproduced, 3 denotes an input terminal for a horizontal synchronizing signal, 4 denotes an input terminal for reproduction mode select signals, 5 denotes a first converter, 6 denotes a comb line filter, 7 denotes a delay line imparting a delay of 1H, 8 denotes a first change over switch, 9 denotes a second change over switch, 10 denotes an output terminal for corrected reproduced chroma signal, 11 denotes a second converter, 12 denotes an APC Automatic Phase Control circuit, 14 denotes an oscillator circuit, 15 denotes a first phase shifter, 16 denotes a second phase shifter, 17 denotes a third change over switch, 18 denotes a burst gate circuit, 19 denotes a phase comparator circuit, 20 denotes an integrator, 21 denotes a voltage comparator, 22 denotes a monostable multivibrator, 23 denotes a flip flop circuit, 24 denotes a reference REF signal generator, 25 denotes an AND circuit, and 26 denotes a track jump pulse generating circuit hereinafter also referred to as JP generating circuit . Describing operations of the apparatus shown in Fig. 3, the low Erequency converted chroma signal applied to the input terminal 2 is converted to the chroma signal having a carrier frequency f5 of ca. 4.43 MRz by the first converter 5 and transmitted to the first change over siwtch 8 and the 1H delay line 7 through the comb line filter 6. The first change over siwtch 8 serves for changing over the input chroma signal and the output chroma signal to and from the 1H dealy line 7 every time discontinuity of the chroma signal is produced upon every track jumping. The chroma signal thus having been corrected in respect with the discontinuity is supplied to the second change over switch 9. This second switch 9 serves for replacing only the burst of the chroma signal supplied from the first change over switch 17 by the reference signal supplied from the third change over switch 17 in response to the burst flag pulse signal Pf applied to the input terminal 1. The reference signal available from the output of the third switch 17 is a signal whose phase difference relative to the carrier of the reproduced chroma signal is changed over between 1350 and 2250 for every line and is similar to the burst signal in the PAL system.The chroma signal thus corrected in respect of the discontinuity and obtained from the output of the second change over siwtch 9 is supplied from the output terminal 10 to a mixer to be combined with a reproduced luminance signal. Next, description will be made on the track jump pulse also referred to as JP signal generating circuit 26 indicated as enclosed by a broken line block.The burst signal obtained at the output of the first change over switch 8 is supplied to the phase comparator circuit 19 by way of the burst gate circuit 18. At the phase comparator circuit 19, the burst signal undergoes phase comparison with a reference signal similar to the burst signal, whereby a 900 phase step of the burst signal which is produced when the components R Y and R Y of the reproduced chroma signal are not alternately arrayed for every line is detected. The resulting detection pulse is integrated by the integrator circuit 20 whose output voltage is compared with theREF signal supplied from the REF signal generator circuit 24 by the voltage comparator circuit 21.A detection signal indicating that the output voltage from the integrator circuit 20 exceeds the level of the REF signal is fed through the monostable multivibrator 22 back to the integrator circuit 20 for discharging the integrated signal on one hand and fed to the AND circuit 25 through the flip flop 23 to be ANDed with the reproduction mode signal supplied from the input terminal 4, whereby the resulting JP i.e. track jump pulse signal is introduced to the first change over switch 8. The prior art apparatus mentioned above is however disadvantageous in that absence of the burst signal as caused, for example, by drop out involves error in the detection of the track jumping point to thereby falsify the correction of discontinuity of the chroma signal described hereinbefore. Further, for accomplishing the correction sufficiently accurately, it is required to change over the level of the REF signal generated by the REF signal generator circuit 24 between different values preset for the special reproductions such as the search reproduction, still reproduction and the slow reproduction, respectively, requiring much complicated circuit configurations.Besides, the level of the REF signal varies in dependence on other parameters such as the head track width, video track pitch and others, involving difficulty in the level setting of the REF signal while requiring much complicated circuit configuration, to further disadvantages. Needlesss to say, it is extremely difficult to realize the system compatibility as desired. It is an object of the present invention to provide a track jump detecting method which is capable of detecting accurately the timing at which a magnetic head is switched over to an adjacent track or to a next adjacent track located by one track away in a magnetic recording reproducing apparatus. It is another object of the present invention to provide a method of detecting with enhanced accuracy the track jumping points at which magnetic heads are displaced to the respective adjacent tracks or the respective next adjacent tracks located by one track away in a helical scan type video tape recorder or VTR in which at least two rotary magnetic heads having different azimuth angles are employed. It is a further object of the present invention to provide an apparatus which can carry out the above methods with a simplified and inexpensive circuit structure For accomplishing the above objects, it is proposed according to an aspect of the present invention that, in a magnetic recording reproducing apparatus in which information is recorded and reproduced on and from a magnetic tape through helical scanning by at least two rotatable magnetic heads having azimuth angles different from each other, a pilot signal is recorded in multiple on the record tracks on which information is recorded through helical scanning, wherein the pilot signal reproduced upon playback operation or reproduction is so processed that the track jumping points at which the rotary magnetic heads are displaced to the respective adjacent tracks or to the next adjacent tracks located by one track away can be detected. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the pilot signal to be recorded in multiple is recorded on at least four record tracks located adjacent to one another with frequencies differing from one to another track, at positions in the longitudinal direction of the record track which differ from one to another track and or with different phases, wherein the recording of the pilot signal is repeated periodically at least at every fourth tracks. By reproducing the pilot signals recorded in this manner and processing the reproduced pilot signals according to the teachings of the present invention, detection of the track jumping points can be accomplished. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, four pilot signals fl, f2, f3 and f4 having frequencies different from one another may be recorded on the record tracks in a predetermined sequence. These pilot signals of four different frequencies are related to one another in respect of the frequency in such a manner as defined by the following expressions f2 fl 4 f3 k fH f3 fl f4 f2 r m fH kPm where fH represents the horizontal scanning frequency, and k and m are positive numbers, respectively. The pilot signals of four different frequencies may be, respectively, recorded on the associated record tracks over the whole region thereof or alternatively may be recorded intermittenlty during the horizontal synchronization or front porch period. The sequence in which the pilot signals of four different frequencies f1 to f4 may be in the order of fl, f2, f4 and f3 or alternatively fl, 3, f4 and f2. More particularly, when the two magnetic heads having different azimuth angles are designated by A and B, respectively, the magnetic head A is so adapted as to record the pilot signal fl or f4 while the other magnetic head B records the pilot signal f2 or f3 on the associated record tracks in either one of the aforementioned order. According to the invention, the pilot signals reproduced in a special reproduction mode are subjected to frequency conversion with carrier signals having the same frequencies as the pilot signals and subsequently the components m fH and k.fH are extracted. By determining the difference in frequency between both the components m fH and k fH, it is possible to detect the track jumping points. The carrier signal for the pilot signals reproduced by the magnetic head A should be allotted with the frequency f2 or f31 while the carrier signal for the pilot signals reproduced by the magnetic head B should have the frequency fl or f4. The pilot signals should preferably have the frequencies lying in the vicinity of ca. 100 KHz. As an example of the set of pilot signals which satisfy the above defined relations, selection may be made such that f1 6.5 fH f2 7.5 fH f3 9.5 fH and f4 10.5 for k s 1 and m 3. As another example, the pilot frequencies may be selected such that fl 6.88 fH 2 7.8 fH f3 9.75 fH and f4 10.64 fH for k 1 and m 3. In a further embodiment of the present invention, the timing signal representative of the detected track jump may be subjected to a phase comparison with a control signal synchronized with the changing over of the magnetic heads through a PLL circuit, wherein a capstan servo circuit is controlled in accordance with the result of the comparison, to thereby obtain the much stabilized timing signals representing the track jumping points, respectively. The above and other objects, novel features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent by reading the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1A is a schematic view illustrating, by way of example, a relationship between record tracks and magnetic heads A and B in a search reproduction mode of a two head helical scan type video tape recorder orVTR Fig. 1B is a schematic view illustrating, by way of example, a relationship bewteeen the record tracks and the magnetic heads A and B in a still reproduction mode of the two head helical scan type VTR Fig. 2 shows signal waveform diagrams for schematically illustrating examples of FM signals reproduced in the search reproduction mode and the still reproduction mode illustrated in Figs. 1A and IB, respectively Fig. 3 is a block diagram showing circuit arrangement for protecting color video signals for PAL system from decolorization with the aid of hithterto known track jumping point detecting means Fig. 4 is a block diagram showing a circuit arrangement for recording in multiple four pilot signals of different frequencies on the record tracks according to the teaching of the present invention Fig. 5 is a plan view illustrating schematically the record tracks having the four pilot signals of different frequencies recorded on a recording tape of the two head helical scan type VTR and tracking patterns of the magnetic heads A and B in the search reproduction mode Fig. 6 is a block diagram showing a circuit arrangement for detecting the track jumping point in a special reproduction mode with the aid of the four pilot signals of different frequencies according to an embodiment of the present invention Fig. 7 shows signal waveform diagrams of signals appearing at various circuit points of the track jumping point detecting circuit shown in Fig. 6 in the search reproducing operation effected at a speed six times as high as the normal reproducing speed Fig. 8 is a plan view illustrating schematically the record tracks having the four pilot signals of different frequencies recorded on the magnetic tape of the two head helical scan type VTR together with the tracking or tracing patterns of the magnetic heads A and B in the slow reproducing operation effected at a speed reduced to a half of the normal reproducing speed Fig. 9 shows signal waveform diagrams of signals appearing at various circuit points of the track jumping point detecting circuit shown in Fig. 6 in the slow reproduction effected at the half speed Fig. 10 shows signal waveform diagrams of signals appearing at various circuit point of the track jumping point detecting circuit shown in Fig. 6 in the still reproduction mode Fig. 11 is a block diagram showing a circuit arrangement for detecting the track jumping point in the special reproduction mode with the aid of the four pilot signals of different frequencies recorded in an intermittent manner according to another embodiment of the present invention Fig. 12 is a plan view showing schematically and exemplarily the record tracks on which the single frequency pilot signal of a given frequency fro is intermittently recorded Fig. 13 is a block diagram showing a circuit arrangement for detecting the track jumping point in the special reproduction mode with the aid of the pilot signal flu shown in Fig. 12 according to still another embodiment of the present invention Fig. 14 is a signal waveform diagram showing an output signal of a mixer 51 employed in the circuit shown in Fig. 13 Fig. 15 is a plan view illustrating schematically an example of the intermittent recording of the single frequency pilot signal of a given frequency fro on the record tracks Fig. 16 is a block diagram showing a circuit arrangement for detecting the track jumping point with the aid of the single frequency pilot signal fro shown in Fig. 15 according a further embodiment of the present invention Fig. 17 is.a block diagram showing a circuit arrangement for fixing noise band in the special reproduction mode with the aid of JP signal produced by a track jumping point detecting circuit according to a still further embodiment of the invention Fig. 18 is a block diagram showing a version of the circuit shown in Fig. 17 and Fig. 19 is a block diagram showing, by way of example, a circuit arrangement for controlling the magnetic tape transporting speed with the aid of theJP signal produced by the track jumping point detecting circuit according to the present invention. Now, the invention will be described in detail in conjunction with the exemplary embodiments by first taking as an example the application where the four pilot signals of different frequencies fl, i , f3 and f are made use of. Fig. 4 shows, by way of example, a circuit arrangement for recording the above mentioned pilot signals on the individual video tracks. Referring to Fig. 4, a reference numeral 27 denotes an input terminal for an FM lun inance signal, 28 denotes an input terminal for a chroma signal converted to a low frequency band, 29 denotes an input terminal for a pulse signal generated in synchronism with the switching or change over of magnetic heads, 30 denotes a first mixer, 31 denotes a second mixer, 32 denotes a recording amplifier, 33 denotes a magnetic head, 34 denotes a pilot signal generating circuit, and 5 denotes a selecting circuit. The FM luminance signal and the low band chroma signal are mixed by the first mixer circuit 30 and subsequently supplied to the second mixer 31.On the other hand, the pilot signals fl, 2, f and f4 produced by the pilot signal generating circuit 34 are introduced to the selecting circuit 35 in which the pilot signals are sequentially selected in a cyclical order or row of fl, f2, f4 and then f31 for example, in response to the pulse signal applied to the input terminal 29 in synchronism with the change over of the magnetic heads, to be subsequently supplied to the second mixer 31. In the case of the embodiment now being considered, it is assumed that the pilot signals fl and fo are selected when the magnetic head of channel A is turned on, while the pilot signals f2 and f3 are selected when the magnetic head of channel B is activated.The second mixer 31 serves to mix the mixed luminance FM signal and low band chroma signal with the pilot signals supplied from the selecting circuit 35. The resultant signal is fed to the magnetic head 33 through the recording amplifier 32 to be recorded on a magnetic tape. Fig. 5 illustrates, by way of example, a pattern of the video tracks having the pilot signals recorded thereon in the manner described above. In Fig. 5, A1, A2 and so forth represent the video tracks of a channel A, while B1, B2 and so forth represent the video tracks of a channel B. Here, description will be made with reference to Fig. 5 about the principle of detection of the track jumping points in the search reproducing operation effected at a speed six times as high as that of the normal reproduction. In general, in the high density recording reproducing apparatus such as VTR where no guard band is employed, the azimuth recording scheme is adopted with a view to suppressing the cross talk components derived from the adjacent video tracks.In Fig. 5, the magnetic heads A and B have the same azimuth angles as those of the magnetic heads which are used in the recording on the video tracks of the channels A and B, respectively, and serves to reproduce the signals recorded on the video tracks of the channels A and B, respectively The tracking patterns of the magnetic heads A and B are indicated by broken lines in Fig. 5. Fig. 6 shows an arrangement of a track jumping point detecting circuit according to an embodiment of the invention which can be employed in combination with the apparatus described above. In Fig. 6 a reference numeral 36 denotes an input terminal for the reproduced pilot signals fl, 2, f3 and 4, 37 denotes an input terminal for a pulse signal applied thereto in synchronism with the change over of the magnetic heads A and B, 38 denotes a frequency converter, 39 denotes a first tank circuit, 40 denotes a second tank circuit, 41 denotes a differential amplifier, 42 denotes a limiter circuit, 43 denotes an output terminal for the JP signal, and 44 is 8 selecting circuit. Fig. 7 shows signal waveform diagrams for illustrating operations of the circuit arrangement shown in Fig. 6. Referring to Fig. 7, an FM envelope waveform of the signal reproduced by the magnetic heads in the search playback or reproduction mode is illustrated at 7b, said signal having been recorded in the manner described hereinbefore in conjunction with Fig. 4. In Fig. 7, symbols A1, A2, A3 and B4 represent the record tracks, respectively. Arrows 7b represent the track jumping points which coincide, respectively, with points constrictions at which. magnitude of the envelope waveform 7a becomes minimum. It should here be mentioned that the frequencies of the pilot signals fl, f2, f3 and f4 are usually lower than that of the low band converted chroma signal and selected at values laying in the vicinity of about 100 KHz. Under the conditions, since the azimuth effect of the magnetic head may be neglected, the pilot signals reproduced by one and the same magnetic head will be at a substantially constant level. Accordingly, the pilot signals which are reproduced at the maximum level follow the sequence illustrated at Fig. 7e and are applied to the input terminal 36 to be supplied to the frequency converter 38. On the other hand, the pulse signal illustrated at 7h is applied to the input signal 37 in synchronism with the change over of the magnetic heads to be supplied to the selecting circuit 44 as the control signal, whereby the pilot signals fl, f2, f3 and f4 produced by the pilot signal generating circuit 34 are alternately selected for every frame to be supplied to the frequency converter 38 as the carrier signals. For the carrier signals for the frequency converter 38, the pilot signal f2 or f3 recorded on the tracks of channel B is selected when the magnetic head for the tracks of channel A is turned on for the reproducing operation, while the pilot signal fl or f4 recorded on the tracks of channel A is selected when the reproduction is carried out by the magnetic head of the channel B, as is illustrated at 7d in Fig. 7.Accordingly, the frequency differences between the reproduced pilot signals 7c and the carrier signals 7d making appearance at the output of the frequency converter 38 are such as illustrated at 7e in Fig. 7 When the tank frequencies of the first and the second tank circuits 39 and 40 shown in Fig. 6 are selected at k fK and mXfH, respectively, the output of the differential amplifier 41 will then be what is illustrated at 7f in Fig. 7. The output signal 7f of the differential amplifier 41 is caused to pass through the limiter circuit 42 for detecting the zero crossing point of the signal lf, which results in that the JP signal shown at 7g in Fig. 7 is produced at the output terminal 43. In the case of the example illustrated in Fig. 5, the sequence in which the pilot signals are recorded is so selected that they are recorded in the order of fl, f21 f4 and then f3 in each cycle. In that case, it should be noted that the JP signal can be detected independent of the search speed in the search reproduction mode when the order in which the pilot signals fl, 2, f3 and f are selectively and sequentially extracted by the selecting circuit 44 shown in Fig. 6 for each field is so set as to be of f2 1 3 f4 in each repeated cycle. Further, in the case of the example illustrated in Fig. 5, the pilot signals may also be recorded in the cyclical sequence of fl b f3 f4 f2. In that case, it is also possible to detect the JP signal in the special reproduction mode by sequentially and selectively extracting the pilot signals through the selecting circuit 44 in the cyclical order of f2 f4 f3 fl. In the foregoing, the track jumping point detecting method has been described in conjunction with the search reproduction mode in which the magnetic heads having different azimuth angles are changed over for every channel, as is in the case of the frame reproduction.However, it is also possible to detect the track jumping point even in such seach reproduction in which the magnetic heads having the same azimuth angle are used for each of the channels, as is in the case of the field reproductoin. By the way, the use of the magnetic heads having the same azimuth angle for each of the channels in the search reproduction is practically adopted in the helical scan type VTR or the like which is provided with two magnetic heads whose azimuth angles differ from each other and one magnetic head having the same azimuth angle as either one of said two magnetic heads. When the pilot signal f2 or f3 recorded on the track of channel B is reproduced by the magnetic head having the same azimuth angle as that of the magnetic head associated with the channel track A to be utilized as the carrier signal supplied to the frequency converter or alternatively when the pilot signal fl or f4 recorded on the channel track A is reproduced with the same azimuth angle as that of the magnetic head of the channel trackB to be utilized as the carrier signal, it is possible to obtain the JP signal by using constantly one and the same frequency in the same manner as in the case of the circuit shown in Fig. 6 without any need for exchanging the carrier signal for every channel. In the foregoing, the principle of the track jumping point detecting method according to the invention has been described in conjunction with the search reproduction or playback. It should be noted that the invention can equally be applied to the detection of the track jumping point in the slow reproduction as well. Fig. 8 shows an example of the tracking patterns of the reproducing heads in the slow playback operation effected at a speed corresponding to a half of the normal reproducing speed. The recording of the pilot signals fl, for f3 and f4 is carried out in the same manner as described hereinbefore in conjunction with Fig. 4. InFig. 8, the tracking pattern of the magnetic head A is indicated by broken lines, while that of the magnetic head B is indicated by single dotted broken lines. The magnetic heads A and B are destined to reproduce mainly the information on the channel tracks A and B, respectively. The jumping point detecting circuit for the slow reproduction may be realized in the identical arrangement with the one shown in Fig. 6. Fig. 9 shows signal waveform diagrams to illustrate the track jumping point detecting operation in the slow reproduction operation. In Fig. 9, the reproduced FM envelope signal waveform is shown at 8a. It will be seen that because of the azimuth effect, the track jumping points 8b are located at points where the. reproduced FM envelope signal waveform is constricted, as is in the case of the search reproduction. The reproduced pilot signals fi i 1, 2, 3, 4 having the maximum signal levels make appearance in the sequence shown at 8c in Fig. 9. The frequency sequence of the carrier signals produced by the selecting circuit 44 is illustrated at 8d, while the frequency difference signal appearing at the output of the converter 38 is illustrated at 8e in Fig.9.Further, there is shown at 8f the output signal of the differential amplifier 41. Thus, the JP signal is obtained at the output of the limiter circuit 42, as shown at 8s in Fig. 9. It should be mentioned that the frequency of the carrier signaled produced by the selecting circuit is selected in the same manner as in the case of the search reproduction operation. That is, when the magnetic head A is turned on, the pilot signal of the frequency f2 or f3 is selected, while the frequency fl or f4 is selected when the magnetic head B is turned on. Further, the frequency sequence of the carrier signal 8d cyclically repeated for every field is determined in dependence on the sequence in which the pilot signal frequencies are recorded in the same manner, as is in the case of the search reproduction operation. In this way, the JP signal can also be detected in other slow reproduction operations in which different tape transporting speeds are used. Next, description will be made on another embodiment of the invention in which the inventive principle is applied to the still reproduction operation by referring to Fig. 10 on the assumption that relationship between the magnetic heads A and B and the record tracks is such as shown in Fig. 1B and that the pilot signal fl is recorded on the track A3 with the pilot signal f3 being recorded on the track B2 in multiple. Referring to Fig. 10, the FM envelope signal waveform is shown at l0a. As will be seen, the track jumping points 10b are located at every minimum point Cconstricted point of the FM envelope signal waveform. The most significant frequencies of the reproduced pilot signals follow the sequence shown at lOc.The carrier signal produced by the selecting circuit 44 is shown at lOd, The difference frequency signal appearing at the output of the frequency converter 38 is shown at l0e, while the output signal of the differential amplifier 41 is shown at lOf. The JP signal shown at lOg can thus be obtained at the output of the limiter circuit 42. Finally, the pulse signal generated in synchronism with the switching of the magnetic heads is shown at l0h. In the still reproduction operation, the pilot signals fl, f2, f3 and f4 are exchanged for every channel in the sequence which depends on the recording sequence in the same manner as is in the case of the search reproduction operation. In the above description of the track jumping point detecting method with reference to Fig 10, it has been assumed that the magnetic heads having the different azimuth angles, respectively, are changed over to each other at every channel in the still reproduction, as is, for example, in the case of the frame reproduction. However, the invention can equally be applied to the detection of the track jumping points in the reproduction where the magnetic heads of the same azimuth angle are used for the respective channel, as is, for example, in the case of the field reproduction. More specifically, when any one of combinations of the pilot frequencies f2 and fl, f2 and 4, f3 and f3 and f4 is used as the carrier signal supplied to the frequency converter 38 shown in Fig. 6, e.g. when the frequencies f2 and fl are alternately exchanged with each other for every channel, the JP signal indicating the track jumping point can be obtained. With the phrase track jumping point used in conjunction with the field reproduction, it is intended to designate the switching point interposed between the two fields one of which is reproduced from the record track A3 by means of the magnetic head A, while the other is also reproduced from the succeeding track A3 by the same head A prefer to Fig. lB . As will be appreciated from the foregoing description, it is possible according to the teaching of the present invention to detect the track jumping point in all the special reproduction or playback modes without any special control or restriction being imposed in dependence on the selected mode. By utilizing the JP signal thus obtained as the control signal for the first switch circuit 8 shown in Fig. 3, the line sequence of the chroma signal can be stably maintained, whereby possibility of decolorization can be excluded. In the case of the embodiment of the invention described so far, it is assumed that the pilot signals fl, 2, f3 and f4 are recorded over the whole regions of the record tracks. However, the invention is not restricted to such recording scheme. The invention can also be realized by recording these pilot signals fl f2, f3 and f4 intermittently, for example, during the horizontal synchronizing signal period or front porch period and utilizing the pilot signals reproduced intermittently in the reproducing operations. Fig. 11 shows an exemplary embodiment of the circuit for detecting the track jumping points in the reproduction of the intermittently recorded pilot signals f1 to f4 not shown . The circuit arrangement shown in Fig. 11 differs from the one shown in Fig. 6 in respect that a hold circuit 44 is disposed on the output side of the differential amplifier 41, which hold circuit 44 is adapted to gate the output signal of the differential amplifier 41 only during the pilot signal detecting period and otherwise hold the peak level of the output signal of the differential amplifier 41 detected during the detection period. with this circuit arrangement, it is possible to detect the track jumping point with high accuracy, as is in the case of the preceding embodiments of the invention. Next, as the most typical example of the intermittent recording of the pilot signals, description will be made of an embodiment of the invention in which a single pilot signal of a given frequency f is intermittently recorded on the tracks. Fig. 12 shows an example of the track pattern in which the single frequency pilot signal f, is intermittently recorded on a magnetic tape. In this figure, symbols A1, A2 and A3 represent the record tracks belonging to the channel A, while B1 B2 and B3 represent the record tracks belonging to the channel B. Thick solid line segments represent the pilot signal f recorded intermittently every fourth horizontal period H on each of the record tracks. Needless to say, control for the recording of the pilot signal has been so made that the pilot signal record pattern illustrated in Fig. 12 can be obtained. Fig. 13 shows an exemplary embodiment of the circuit for detecting the track jumping point in reproduction of the record pattern illustrated in Fig. 12. Referring to Fig. 13, a reference numeral 45 denotes an input terminal for the reproduced pilot signal, 46 is an input terminal for a control signal which is used for gating the pilot signal, 47 is an input terminal for the pulse signal generated in synchronism with the change over of the magnetic heads, 48 is a gate circuit, 49 is a hold circuit, 50 is a circuit for generating a select signal, 51 is a mixer, 52 is an inverter, 53 is a switch circuit, 54 is a limiter circuit, 55 is a flip flop and 56 denotes an output terminal for the JP signal. For elucidating the principle on the basis of which the track jumping point detecting operation can be accomplished with the circuit arrangement shown in Fig.13, it is assumed that the amgnetic head of the channelA is in the course of reproducing the record track A2 as the main track in the search reproduction mode. The pilot signal f thus reproduced are intermittently gated through the gate circuit 48. After elapse of 1H from the reproduction of the pilot signal of the track A2, the level of the pilot signal reproduced from the record track B2 is gated through the gate circuit 48 to be held at a stage P1 of the hold circuit 49. After the succeeding period of 1H, the level of the pilot signal reproduced from the record track B1 is gated to be held at a stage P2 of the hold circuit 49.In the similar manner, the output level of the pilot signal reproduced from the record track A or A3 and gated through the gate circuit 48 is held at a stage P3 of the hold circuit 49. The signals held at the stages P1, P2 and P3 these signals are also represented by P1, P2 and P3 are supplied to the mixer 51 to be arithmetically processed in accordance with P1 P2 P3, the result of the arithemtic operation being fed to the limiter circuit 54 by way of the switch circuit 53. In Fig. 14, there is illustrated the arithmetically determined output level P1 P2 P3 and deviations of the magnetic heads from the respective main tracks.Referring to Fig. 14, a point 14a corresponds to the case in which the magnetic head is located at the center of the record track A2, while a point l4b represents the case in which the magnetic head is positioned at the center of the record track B2, wherein the distance between the points 14a and 14b corresponds to one track pitch. Further, reproduction by the magnetic head for the channel A is represented by a solid line, while that of the magnetic head for the channel B is represented by a broken line.When the arithmetically determined output level is supplied through the limiter circuit 54 to the flip flop 55 which is set in response to the falling edge of the input signal, there can be extracted from the output terminal 56 a signal representative of the point at which the magnetic head is located on the record track B2, i.e. the JP signal representative of the detected track jumping point. In reproduction by the magnetic head of the channel B, the output signal from the mixer 51 is supplied to the limiter circuit 50 after having been inverted through the inverter 52. In this way, the track jumping point can be detected with reliability by making use of the pilot signal of the single frequency two . Fig. 15 shows another example of track pattern in which the pilot signals of the single frequency f, are recorded. Referring to the figure, it will be seen that the pilot signal fO is intermittently recorded on each of the tracks periodically at an interval equal to two horizontal periods 2H and that the pilot signals each represented by a thick solid line are, respectively, out of phase with the pilot signals each represented by a hatched line or stripe. Of course, control has been previously so made in the recording operation that the pattern of the recorded pilot signals illustrated inFig. 15 can be obtained. Fig. 16 shows the track jumping point detecting circuit according to a further embodiment of the present invention which is adapted to be employed for the reproduction of the record pattern shown in Fig. 15. InFig. 16, a reference numeral 57 denotes an input terminal for the reproduced pilot signals, 58 denotes an input terminal for the pulse signal applied thereto in synchronism with the switching or the change over of the magnetic heads, 59 denotes an input signal for a gate control signal for gating the pilot signal of the period of 2H, 60 denotes an inverter circuit, 61 denotes a switch circuit, 62 denotes a delay line exhibiting a delay of 2H, 63 denotes an adder, 64 denotes a subtracter, 65 denotes a low pass filter or LPF, 66 denotes a first gate circuit, 67 denotes a second gate circuit, 68 denotes a first hold circuit, 69 denotes a second hold circuit, 70 denotes a differential amplifier, 71 denotes a limiter circuit, 72 denotes an output terminal for the JP signal and 73 denotes a lH delay circuit. Elucidating the principle on the basis of which the track jumping points can be detected with the circuit arrangement shown in Fig. 16 for the record pattern illustrated in Fig. 15, it is assumed that the magnetic head of the channel A is reproducing the record trackA2 as the main track in the search reproduction mode.At that time, the reproduced pilot signal applied to the input terminal 57 is supplied through the switch circuit 61 to a 2H comb filter constituted by the 2H delay line 62, the adder 63 and the subtracter 64. In this conjunction, the pilot signal reproduced from the tracks of the channel A makes appearance at the output of the adder 63, while the pilot signal reproduced from the tracks of the channel B is derived from the output of the subtracter 64. The output signal from the adder 63 is supplied to the inputs of the first and second gate circuits 66 and 67 through the LPF 65.The signal inputted to the first gate circuit 66 is gated therethrough under the control of the gate signal of the period 2H applied to the input terminal 59, while the signal inputted to the second gate circuit 67 is gated therethrough under the control of the gate signal 59 imparted with the delay of 1H by the lH delay line 73. The outputs from both the gate circuits 66 and 67 are.supplied to the first and second hold circuits 68 and 69, respectively.In this way, the peak value of the pilot signal reproduced from the record track A2 is held by the first hold circuit 68, while that of the pilot signal reproduced from the record track A1 or A3 is held by the second hold circuit 69. The output signals of the peak hold circuits 68 and 69 are applied to both inputs of the differential amplifier 70, resulting in the output signal of positive polarity from the latter when the magnetic head is located along the record track A2 and the output signal of negative polarity when the magnetic head is located on the record track A3. Thus, by passing the output signal of the differential amplifier 70 through the limiter circuit 71, the JP signal similar to that shown in Fig. 7 at 7g can be taken out at the output terminal 72. When the scanning magnetic head is for the channel X, the pilot signal reproduced from the associated track is supplied to the aforementioned 2H comb filter through the inventer circuit 60, whereby the JP signal can be detected in the similar manner. The description made so far has concerned the detection of the track jumping point with the aid of the pilot signals of four different frequencies fl, f2, f3, f4 or the pilot signal of one frequency Cm0 , respectively. However, it is a matter of course that the invention can be carried out by using the pilot signals of three or two different frequencies. Further, in the foregoing description, it has been assumed that the chroma signal can be normally reproduced in the special playback modes such as the search reproduction, still reproduction or the like. In the following, another variety of application of the invention will be described. Fig. 17 shows a circuit which is designed for improving the quality of the image or picture reproduced in the special reproduction modes by making use of the track jumping point detecting signal according to another embodiment of the present invention. In Fig. 17, a reference numeral 79 denotes an input terminal for the JP signal which can be extracted from the output terminal 43 of the circuit shown in Fig.6 and represents the detection of the track jump, 80 denotes a first frequency divider circuit, 81 denotes a phase detection circuit, 82 denotes a second frequency divider circuit, 83 denotes an input terminal for the control signal applied thereto in synchronism with the change over between the magnetic heads, 85 denotes an input terminal for a control signal which indicates whether or not the mode is of the still reproduction, 86 denotes an output terminal for the JP signal representative of the track jump, 87 denotes an output terminal coupled to a capstan servo circuit not shown , and 88 denotes a control circuit.With the circuit arrangement mentioned above, the magnetic tape transporting speed for the search reproduction mode is phase locked to the field or frame period by controlling the capstan servo circuit with a signal derived through the phase comparison of the JP signal applied to the input terminal 73 with the control signal applied to the input terminal 83 in synchronism with the change over of the magnetic heads, whereby the noise band can be essentially fixed on the reproduced picture to improve the quality thereof for visual observation. Further, in the case of the still reproduction, the detection signal outputted from the phase detection circuit 81 is so controlled by the control signal applied to the input terminal 85 through the control circuit 88 that the JP signal be located in the vicinity of the vertical synchronizing signal, to thereby confine the noise band to an end or edge of the reproduced picture, whose quality can thus be improved for visual observation. Fuether, when the JP signal applied to the input terminal 83 in synchronism with the change over of the magnetic head is made use of in the still reproduction with the JP signal applied to the input terminal 79 being used in other reproduction modes as the control signal for correcting the horizontal skew phenomenon as well as the decolorization phenomenon in the PAL system as described hereinbefore, the accuracy or precision required for the correction can be enhanced particularly in the still reproduction mode. To this end, the switch circuit 89 is used for changing over the JP signals supplied to the input terminals 83 and 79 with each other. Fig. 18 shows an arrangement of the circuit for improving the picture quality in the special reproduction mode according to a further embodiment of the present invention In Fig. 18, a reference numeral 9Q denotes a phase detection circuit, 91 denotes a voltage controlled oscillator or VCO, and 92 and 93 denote frequency divider circuits, respectively. Other components are same as those shown in Fig. 17. With the circuit arrangement shown in Fig. 18, the JP signal derived, for example, from the circuit shown in Fig. 6 is supplied to a phase locked loop or PLL circuit which is constituted by the phase detection circuit 90, the VCO 91 and the frequency divider circuit 92, to thereby stabilize the JP signal for the purpose of enhancing the effect attained with the circuit arrangement shown in Fig. 17.Further, in the case of the embodiment shown in Fig. 18, the output signal of the VCO 91 can be utilized as the control signal for correcting the horizontal skew phenomenon and the decolorization phenomenon in the PAL system to attain the excellent result, although details of the circuit configuration to this end is not shown. Fig. 19 shows still another application of the present invention. In this figure, a reference numeral 93 denotes an input terminal for the JP signal detected according to the teaching of the present invention and indicating the track jumping point, 94 denotes an input terminal for a capstan FG pulse signal mentioned below, 95 denotes an input terminal for a control signal mentioned below, 96 denotes an output terminal coupled to a capstan motor drive circuit, 97 and 99 denote frequency divider circuits, respectively, 98 denotes a phase detection circuit, and 100 denotes a capstan servo circuit. With this circuit arrangement, the FG pulse signal representative of the speed of the capstan motor is compared with the JP signal in respect to the phase for thereby controlling the magnetic tape transporting speed.It is then easily possible to change the magnetic tape transporting speeds for every special reproduction operation by correspondingly changing at least the frequency dividing factor of either the frequency divider circuti 97 or 99 with the control signal applied to the input terminal 95. In the foregoing description of the preferred embodiments of the invention, the pilot signal is utilized for the detection of the track jumping points in the special reproduction or playback modes. It goes however without saying that the pilot signal can also be utilized additionally for realizing the automatic tracking which per se has heretofore been known and of which description is omitted. It will now be appreciated that the track jumping points of the magnetic heads in the special reproduction operation such as the search reproduction, the still reproduction or the like reproduction mode can be detected with an improved accuracy in a facilitated manner to assure an improved quality of the reproduced pictures according to the present invention. Further, since these pilot signals can be additionally utilized as those used for the automatic tracking in the normal reproduction, the invention can be realized inexpensively.
