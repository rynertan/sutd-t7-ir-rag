# Oxidation resistant high strength carbonaceous material.

## Abstract
The carbonaceous body of the invention is prepared by shaping and sintering a uniform powdery mixture composed of a powder of a low temperature coke, a powder of boron carbide and a powder of silicon carbide in such a proportion that the weight proportion of the boron carbide and the silicon carbide is in the range from 2 98 to 80 20 and the volume proportion of the coke powder and the combination of the boron carbide and silicon carbide is in the range from 50 50 to 95 5. The carbonaceous body thus obtained is highly resistant against air oxidation even at a temperature of 1400 C in addition to the outstandingly high mechanical strengths in comparison with conventional carbonaceous shaped materials such as artificial graphite.
