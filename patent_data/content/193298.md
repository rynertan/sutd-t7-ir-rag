# METHOD FOR THE FORMATION OF EPITAXIAL LAYERS FOR INTEGRATED CIRCUITS

## Abstract
Epitaxial layers are formed on a silicon substrate by depositing a layer of Î± silicon, e.g. by plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition, at a temperature below 550 C. The layer is recrystallised to a single crystal layer by heating the structure to a temperature between 550 and 900 C. The technique overcomes the problems of wafer distortion experienced in conventional high temperature epitaxial growth.
