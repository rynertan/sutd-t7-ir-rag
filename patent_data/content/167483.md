## Description
The invention relates to a method of making a metal boride of metals selected from the Group IVb metals titanium, zirconium and hafnium, the Group Vb metals vanadium, niobium and tantalum and the Group VIb metals chromium, molybdenum and tungsten, or a mixture or a combination of such metal boride with carbide and or nitride of said metals or of aluminium, by reacting a composition comprising in intimate mixture an oxide of said metals and a boron containing reducing agent. Recently, aspects of colloidal chemistry have been investigated as a starting point for preparing ceramic materials. For example, spherical particles of hydrated basic aluminium sulfate have been formed by a precipitation reaction in aqueous medium. The particles as discussed in Thermal Decomposition of Spherical Hydrated Basic Aluminium Sulfate Ceramic Bulletin, Volume 63, N 2, Pages 301 309, can be calcined to form finely divided particles of aluminium oxide. In related investigations, monodispersed titanium dioxide powders have been synthesized by the controlled hydrolysis of dilute alcoholic solutions of titanium alkoxides. Thus, as discussed in Formation, Packing, and Sintering of Monodispersed TiO₂ Powders , Communications of the American Ceramic Society, December 1982, Pages C 199 to C 201, a dilute alcoholic solution containing titanium tetraethoxide can be used to prepare a very finely divided precipitate. By use of such colloidal chemistry techniques attempts are being made to prepare ideally sinterable powders to produce theoretically dense single phase ceramics, the powders being of a narrow sized distribution and in a non agglomerated state. The refractory metal borides have already been discussed for use as components of electrolytic aluminium production cells. In the production of such materials, solutions of alcoholic titanium have been suggested. Thus in US Patent N 4 595 545 it has been proposed to initially formulate solutions of a titanium alkoxide plus soluble borate together with a soluble carbon source, such as sugar, as reducing agent. By starting with a combination of ingredients in this manner, and by use of subsequent carefully controlled processing techniques, a finely sintered product of desirable density and purity may be achieved. In the preparation of borides by carbothermal reduction using carbon particulates, these particulates can be pressed together with other ingredients. Thus, in British Patent 1,004,585, there is disclosed an intimate mixture of boric oxide and titanium dioxide, which includes particulate carbon such as graphite, thoroughly blended together, then compressed and sintered. A friable powder prepared by such process can be expected to contain a high yield of titanium diboride. Thus, a variety of reactions and approaches are being made to prepare borides. Unfortunately, some techniques although promising in regard to uniformity and purity of materials have proven to be too expensive and inefficient to be practical. Other more practical and economical developments rely on expensive ingredients. It has now been found that highly pure and desirably consolidated borides can be produced by taking advantage of readily available and inexpensive ingredients. Moreover, an economy in processing is provided by the present invention. Borides of a highly desirable microstructure can be produced with product densities leading to extended use, even under severe conditions. The invention is particularly directed to a method of making a metal boride of high purity in a process utilizing carbon nucleated titanium oxide crystals which are admixed with boron containing substance and calcined before further reaction and subsequent sintering, but relates in general to a method of making a metal boride, or a mixture or combination of a metal boride with a carbide and or nitride of the specified metals by reacting a composition comprising in intimate mixture an oxide of said metals and a boron containing reducing agent. Mixtures and combinations include physical mixtures, eg., physical mixtures of titanium and zirconium boride, or mixture produced in two discrete phases such as the simultaneous production of a boride and a nitride or titanium boride plus titanium carbide. Moreover, such mixtures and combinations can include single complex phases, eg., a borocarbide or boronitride. Furthermore such mixtures can include composites such as TiB₂ AlN. The cermets can be formed, for example, by preparing porous composite bodies of the refractory articles and then infiltrating them with other metals or alloys. The method according to the invention comprises establishing a solution of a non oxide substance of said metal in liquid medium, the non oxide substance being a substance with sulfate, halide, nitrate or other oxyanion seeding said solution with solid and insoluble, ultrafine carbon particulates which maintain solid integrity in the resulting dispersion, said ultrafine particles having average particle size within the range of from about 0.01 µm to about 0.1 µm agitating the seeded dispersion gradually adjusting the pH of the liquid medium, while agitation continues, by bringing said liquid medium in contact with organic, carbon containing substance yielding hydroxyl ions in aqueous medium at elevated temperature, while establishing said liquid medium at sufficiently elevated temperature to yield said hydroxyl ions, to precipitate hydrous metal oxide from said substances to thereby form hydrous metal oxide crystals with said ultrafine particulate carbon seeds in said dispersion separating the resulting seeded crystals from said dispersion medium admixing the resulting separated seeded crystals with a boron containing reactant for the metal oxide calcining the resulting admixture and reaction sintering the calcined admixture. The production of these refractory metal borides involves for example the reduction of titanium dioxide with carbon and reaction with boron to form TiB₂. For convenience, the reactant for combination with the metal, as the term is used herein, is meant the substance reacted with such metal in the desired product, ie., boride reactant to prepare titanium boride. For initiating reaction, an aqueous medium containing a non oxide substance of the metal in solution is prepared. The solution can contain for example the sulfate or halide of the metal, for example titanium tetrachloride, although other oxyanions, eg., nitrates are comtemplated. The solution will be subjected to agitation and as such proceeds, there will be admixed with the solution the ultrafine, particulate carbon. The ultrafine carbon particulate should be of high purity so as not to indroduce impurities into the mixture. The ultrafine carbon particulates which are commercially available are generally of sufficient purity, most often having volatiles of less than six weight percent, and may have a volatile content of only two weight percent or even less. For providing intimate contact during later elevated temperature reaction, it is critical that the average particle size of the carbon particulates be below about 0.1 µm and usually above 0.01 µm. Preferably such particulates have an average particle size of between about 0.015 µm and about 0.06 µm. Such particulate carbon can be readily dispersed in the solution containing the metal by continuing the agitation, to prepare a resulting dispersion. In the dispersion such particulates need to be insoluble and retain their particulate, solid integrity to serve as seeds for the hydrous metal oxide crystals. In practice, even under severe conditions, retention of particulate integrity has been maintained even with a dispersion pH on the order of 0.1. Suitable sources of the ultrafine carbon particulates that will maintain their particulates integrity in the dispersion include furnace blacks, channel blacks, lampblacks and acetylene blacks. Although it is desirable to have at least approximate stoichiometric proportions, other parameters can be useful, such as on the order of about 50 percent of the carbon needed for stoichiometry, as determined by the reduction method, to even a slight excess over stoichiometric. Systems other than those relying on an aqueous medium are also contemplated, eg. a titanium tetrachloride solution in carbon tetrachloride and containing the ultrafine carbon particulates in dispersion. Aqueous hydroxyl ion suppplying composition can be blended with such organic solutions to form the precursor material. The carbon tetrachloride can simply be decanted to substantially separate the desired material as a precipitate. The pH of the dispersion is adjusted through the use of an organic substance yielding hydroxyl ions in aqueous medium. The gradual introduction of hydroxyl ions at this stage, without the commensurate introduction of undesired contaminants, eg. undesired cations, is critical, together with uniform introduction of such hydroxyl ions. To accomplish this, an organic substance typically one reacting with water at elevated temperature will be useful. Exemplary of such substances are urea and amines. By way of example, urea reacts with water above about 70 C to form ammonium ions, hydroxyl ions and carbon dioxide. In this manner, the introduction of hydroxyl ions is gradual and uniform. Uniformity is enhanced by continuing agitation of the dispersion during introduction of the organic substance. Such addition will most always be accompanied by carefully controlled heating to assist a gradual and uniform introduction of hydroxyl ions in the solution. By such technique, the pH of the dispersion will change, typically approaching, and maybe even surpassing, neutrality, although a final pH from about 4.5 to about 6 will usually be reached. As such pH change is taking place there will gradually be formed a precipitate of crystals of hydrous metallic oxide nucleated by the particulate ultrafine carbon particles. As hydrolysis is completed, the mixing of ultrafine carbon seeds and the hydrous metallic oxide will be accomplished on a microscopic scale providing final particulates typically having size less than 0.5 µm and average particle size typically of about 0.2 µm. Where a metallic sulfate has been used initially, particles of hydrated basic metallic sulfate can be expected to be included in the precipitate. The resulting precipitate is separated from the supernatant liquid by decantation, centrifuging or other separation techniques, eg. filtration including pressure filtration. During separation, the precipitate cools and thereafter it is usually washed, thereby assisting in cooling and the removal of residual materials, eg. ammonium chloride where a metal chloride has initially been used. After separation, the precipitate is generally dried although under some circumstances a distinct drying step will not be necessary, eg. where the separated precipitate may be blended with further ingredients in wet condition. For example, a carbon nucleated hydrous titanic oxide precipitate could be blended with a solution of boric acid. Usually such technique will not be preferred as such blending will necessarily be followed by a more uneconomical drying operation. Thus, where a blending operation is to be used, it is preferred to dry the separated precipitate and then blend it with dry reactant. By way of illustration, it is preferable to blend a dry boric acid with a material dried after separation, such as carbon nucleated hydrous titanic oxide precipitate. The separated material is dried in the sense of becoming a free flowing particulate material which can include water of hydration. Drying at a temperature of about 100 C for a period of several hours, eg. 6 20 hours, will usually be sufficient to prepare a dry, free flowing particulate from the separated material, ie. a finely divided material feeling dry to the touch. This solid particulate, sometimes referred to as pigmentary particulate, will typically have gray appearance contributed by the carbon seeds. Other procedures for drying, eg. forced air drying, can be used for producing the finely divided material. The pigmentary particulate will have substantially uniformly sized particles, and will usually have an average particle size of not above about 0.5 µm. This particulate can then be blended with other substances, including a reactant. For example, boric acid can be blended with a carbon nucleated hydrous titanic oxide precipitate, for subsequent preparation of titanium diboride. Also, constituent adjustments may now be made preferably using inorganic substances. Thus, for boosting the carbon content of the material, a small amount of the ultrafine carbon can be added. It is however contemplated that organic materials, eg. sucrose and ethylene glycol, will be suitable for adjusting the separated precipitate. It is to be understood that ingredients other than reactant and constituent adjustments may be added. For example, in a subsequent aluminothermic or carboaluminothermic reaction it would be acceptable to add aluminium or an aluminium containing compound to the separated precipitate. The addition of all such materials can be made by any method known to those skilled in the art suitable for preparing well blended mixtures of ingredients. Where a drying step has been employed with the precipitate, subsequent blending can be by any method known for combining dry ingredients, eg. twin shell mixing of a dry precipitate with a dry reactant such as molybdenum dioxide. Where the separated precipitate has not been dried, any known method of wet blending may be useful. And where an insoluble reactant is to be admixed with a precipitate, a wet mixing or wet milling operation can be used. Wet blending can include the addition of substances dissolved or suspended in solvents and the solvents can be made fugitive during the blending operation. It is furthermore contemplated that binders might be useful and ingredient additions can be included in such binder materials. Suitable binders are the usual waxes and organic liquids. The binder itself may be dissolved in a solvent to assist in preparing a uniform dispersion. The solvent can be volatilized during the mixing operation. The resulting blend, prepared by any of the above discussed methods, may then proceed directly or may be pressed and thereafter proceed to a calcining step. Uncalcined particles can be expected to contain significant amounts of water of hydration. Calcining will remove this water. The blend will also proceed through dehydroxylization and, where a sulphate metal salt has been used, there will be desulphurization. The calcining is carried on at a temperature lower than for providing the carbothermic reaction that will take place subsequently during the reaction. The calcining can proceed most always at normal pressure and under an atmosphere of a non interfering gas such as argon. Where a nitride will be included in the desired product, a nitrogen atmosphere would be typically employed. For the calcining, temperatures as moderate as about 250 C to about 350 C or as elevated as from about 600 C to about 900 C may be used. Since the aforedescribed microscopically intimate mixing through ultrafine carbon nucleation has resulted in a highly reactive material, it is preferred that the calcining be carried on at a temperature at least about 200 C and preferably at about 300 C or so, ie. lower than the subsequent sintering temperature in the reaction sintering step. Following calcining there will be produced a particulate of dehydroxylized crystals with most always a gray cast from the presence of the carbon seeds. In the particular case where the boron containing reactant has been used with a carbon nucleated hydrous titanic oxide precipitate, calcining will produce a gray particulate of substantially uniform sized particles with at least essentially all particles passing 100 mesh 0.149 mm US Sieve Series . Before proceeding, certain terms as used hereinafter will be briefly mentioned. A precursor material is the particulate material resulting from the calcining operation. The precursor material can then proceed through a two stage process. The first stage is referred to for convenience as a first reaction step. This step is carried out at elevated temperature, but always substantially less than normal sintering temperature. After this, the higher temperature second stage will be referred to as the sintering step . The reaction step may be combined with the sintering step in a single stage elevated temperature operation. Such optional procedure will be more fully discussed hereinbelow. At this juncture, another opportunity is presented for constituent adjustments. As discussed hereinbefore, for most economical operation, inorganic substances will be used. Also, another opportunity is presented for the addition of, eg., aluminium for a subsequent aluminothermic reaction. The addition of such materials can be made by the methods as discussed hereinabove, such as by the use of binders with ingredient additions. After the adjustments and typically a blending operation, the resulting mixture is then generally pressed by roller pressing or dry pressing in a mould or by isostatic pressing, or cold pressing and heating, or by hot pressing. This produces a body of the mixture for further reaction by heating. Other operations, eg. machining or drilling of the resultant shaped product may be employed before heating. At this stage of the process, when the powder is pressed into a shaped article, the presence of a binder is optional. A typical pressure for the pressing can be within the range of from about 0.5 KPSI 0.07 Bar to about 20 KPSI 3 Bar , and most usually from about 0.5 KPSI 0.07 Bar to 2 KPSI 0 29 Bar . After pressing the material is ready for heating. The heating step is the reaction step , in which the material is generally first heated for a brief time at a reduced temperature, for example from about 200 400 C, to permit low temperature drying. When the process is a carbothermic reduction, it will be typical before heating to load the article in a carbon or graphite crucible. Even during the initial low temperature heating, it is preferred that this reaction step process proceed under reduced pressure to facilitate evacuation of trapped gasses. Low pressure is maintained as heating continues, eg. the step is carried out in a vacuum at a pressure within the range of from about 1 millitorr 0.13 Pa to about 5000 millitorrs 666.6 Pa , and more typically within the range of from about 50 millitorrs 6.66 Pa to about 1000 millitorrs 133.3 Pa . At this reaction step is continued, the temperature is increased but is always maintained substantially less than the normal sintering temperature. In the specific case of the production of titanium diboride, the brief, initial heating at a reduced temperature can be followed by a relatively fast temperature increase to about 1100 C. The heating rate may be reduced such that the shaped article is heated in this first reaction step to a temperature maximum within the range of from about 1100 C to about 1400 C. For comparison, a usual temperature for initiating the reaction for titanium diboride is about 1500 C or more. At the upper, attained temperature level in this reaction step, the shaped articles are allowed to remain for a time period sufficient to complete at least substantial reaction. It is advantageous that this reaction proceed virtually to completion, eg. to above 95 percent and more usually to 99 percent of so. For a product where off gasses will be produced as reaction progresses, the progress of the reaction can be monitored by plotting temperature and pressure against time. Thus, when it is observed that the pressure begins to substantially decrease, this indicates that the reaction is approaching completion. The heating can be maintained for a while longer or terminated to end this reaction step and the product is permitted to cool. If the resulting material crumbles easily, it need not be comminuted, otherwise such operation is generally in order. Since sintering has not as yet occurred, constituent adjustments, or often constituent additions, can again be made to the product. If it is deemed that no adjustments or additions are needed, the pulverulent product may then be processed. For this processing, a pressing operation using a binder such as camphor, polyethylene glycol or paraffin wax can be advantageous to insure structural integrity and thus a form stable condition of the shaped article during the subsequent sintering step. However, all the usual forming methods are contemplated, eg. slip casting and moulding procedures. The shaped article can be machined to obtain a desired shape or geometry. For example, holes may be drilled into the article to obtain a honeycomb structure. The sintering step then proceeds under reduced pressure and at sintering temperature, and most desirably with an established sintering aid atmosphere. By this is meant that the atmosphere around the shaped article contains a sintering aid ingredient in the vapour phase. The appropriate atmosphere of activating agent, or sintering aid , may be provided by addition of materials directly or by reaction. In the particular case of preparing titanium diboride, boron carbide or boron nitride, or both, can serve as sintering aid. The boron nitride may be present as a particulate material, and in such form it can be incorporated with other reaction ingredients. Thus, it can be pressed with such ingredients into a compact for sintering. Or the loosed particulate can be adjacent the compact. Boron nitride in a dual role may serve not only as an assistant in reaction sintering, but also as a reaction participant, as in the preparation of composites, such as those combining aluminium nitride with refractory metal borides, as will be discussed further hereinbelow. At the reduced pressure of the reaction sintering, the boron carbide or boron nitride will have a finite vapour pressure that will establish a sintering aid atmosphere. For the preparation of titanium diboride, other materials useful for establishing this sintering aid atmosphere by reaction could be elemental boron, active carbon, or carbonitrides of titanium, as examples of other sources for boron and carbon vapours. To achieve the sintering, the heating will be initiated gradually, especially where binder has been used, to accomodate binder burnoff. When this has been accomplished, and as heating is continued under reduced pressure, a quite rapid temperature increase can be permitted. In case of the preparation of titanium diboride, the shaped article might be heated from a temperature of about 500 C to over 2000 C in a time as short as about 0.5 hour or as long as about 2 hours. Such titanium diboride can then be maintained at a sintering temperature, generally within the range of from 2000 C to not above 2300 C, advantageously at a temperature within the range of from about 2000 C to about 2100 C, for a time of from about 1 hour to about 4 hours. Sintering times of less than about 1 hour for titanium diboride can result in insufficient consolidation. If sintering times exceed more than about 4 hours, unwanted contaminants from surrounding materials may be aggregated with the desired product. At the end of the sintering operation, the resulting sintered product is permitted to cool and can then be separated from any adhering materials, eg. a surrounding pulverulent sintering aid material. Such material can generally be removed from the product either by surface grinding or brushing. The foregoing discussion on heating has been presented as a two step procedure, going first to a reaction step and then to a sintering step. This is the preferred procedure for flexibility in adjusting the reactants and to produce the most pure, consolidated material. It is, however, to be understood that a one step heating procedure may be used. In general, the above discussed reaction step would be employed, and from there the process would proceed directly to the more elevated temperature sintering, but being careful that the other sintering step features, such as sintering aid atmosphere, are utilized. As mentioned briefly, in the two step heating sequence, the precursor powder, before the reaction step, may be blended with additional reactants or substances and then further heat processed. In the specific case of a TiB₂ AlN composite, the AlN can be admixed with the precursor powder prior to the firing step. Alternatively, boron nitride and metallic aluminium can be added separately, to form the metallic aluminium nitride in situ. In the formation of a TiB₂ AlN composite, the processing for preparing such materials can be initiated with the carbon seeding of the aqueous medium containing metal in solution. In this processing, particulate metal and more specifically particulate aluminium for the illustrative composite, is present as a seeding ingredient along with the ultrafine carbon. Processing continues as described hereinbefore such that, for example, a carbon nucleated as well as aluminium nucleated hydrous titanic oxide precipitate is prepared. This precipitate is then processed in the manner as hereinabove described. There can initially result from this technique a gray pigmentary powder of hydrous metal oxide nucleated with the carbon and aluminium particle seeds. Drying can produce a free flowing particulate, dry to the touch. Additional pulverulent metal, eg. aluminium flake or powder, can be blended with this dry particulate. For efficiency, it is preferred that the addition of pulverulent metal be initiated at this juncture. Thus, the metal is blended with hydrous metallic oxide precipitate which is only carbon nucleated. Other ingredients, eg. boron nitride may be added at this stage of the preparation method. The material can then proceed to the calcining operation in the manner discussed. After calcining, where particulate metal has been used along with ultrafine carbon in seeding, the calcining will now produce an electrically and thermally conductive particulate. The particulate will comprise dehydroxylized metal oxide nucleated with the ultrafine carbon plus the particulate metal. Following calcining, a substituent addition stage is again presented. This includes an opportunity for constituent adjustments. Again, materials such as particulate aluminium, aluminium nitride and boron nitride would be considered where processing has been initiated with a titanium metal and a TiB₂ AlN composite is the desired finished product. Processing steps as discussed hereinbefore, are then to be undertaken for proceeding through to the final preparation of the composite. Thus, alternatives to the mere carbothermic reaction are serviceable in the present invention. As outlined hereinabove, one useful alternative procedure is the carboaluminothermic reaction, ie.. reduction with both carbon and aluminium. As an illustration, titanium oxide mixed with boron oxide can be reduced with carbon and aluminium, and, if conducted in the presence of a nitrogen atmosphere will produce titanium diboride and aluminium nitride. Also, aluminium nitride can be added directly to the precursor or produced in situ by reaction between boron nitride and aluminium. Ingredients for preparing a composite in the final sintering step can be mixed together before sintering and pressed into a shaped article, typically using a binder as has been discussed in greater detail hereinbefore. The pressed article is then generally brought up to sintering temperature as described hereinbefore, preferably under an argon atmosphere as when preparing TiB₂ AlN to prevent loss of aluminium nitride. For sintering the TiB₂ AlN composite, a temperature from about 1800 C to about 2100 C is maintained for a time of about 2 hours to about 8 hours. The resulting shaped article is then allowed to cool and treated as described hereinabove. This specific composite is particularly useful in an aluminium electrowinning process for its known resistance to both aluminium and cryolite. The following example shows a way in which the invention has been practiced but should not be construed as limiting the invention. A solution of 496 milliliters of aqueous titanium tetrachloride was prepared in 2500 milliliters of deionized water. With constant stirring, there was added to this solution, 87 grams of an ultrafine carbon black which was an acetylene black having an average particle size of 0.04 µm. The resulting dispersion had a pH of about 0.1. As agitation continued, urea addition was initiated. During urea addition, heat was applied. As the pH of the dispersion approached 1.5, and the dispersion temperature approached 100 C, a precipitate started to form. Urea addition was continued until 173 grams of urea had been added. Heating was maintained at 100 C. The resulting dispersion achieved a slightly basic pH. The precipitate was filtered and air dried for about 16 hours at 110 C. There resulted a gray free flowing particulate, dry to the touch, containing a hydrous titanium oxide nucleated with the carbon black seeds. All of the material passed through a 50 mesh 0.297 mm screen U.S.S.S. . 209 grams of this material was blended with 267 grams of dry, pulverulent boric acid for one hour. The resulting blend was placed in an alumina crucible, which was put in an Inconel retort that was placed in a crucible furnace. For calcining in the furnace, the mixture was heated for 8 hours at 250 C under a flowing argon atmosphere. After heating, the product was cooled and found to be a gray particulate, which was lightly ground by brushing through a sieve to produce a free flowing particulate. This was observed by visual inspection to be a well mixed blend of the carbon nucleated titanium oxide in admixture with the boric acid. This material was found to contain 23.2 weight percent titanium, 22.5 weight percent carbon and 8.6 weight percent boron with a balance presumed to be oxygen and residual water. More of the above described acetylene black, along with boric acid, were added to adjust the particulate composition to 19.6 weight percent titanium, 13.2 weight percent boron and 24.8 weight percent carbon. The resulting particulate material was then uniaxially pressed at about one KPSI 0.147 Bar into pellets that were placed in clean carbon crucibles. The pellets were then heated in a vacuum furnace initially at low temperatures in the range of 100 300 C until gas evolution subsided, then they were heated to 1100 C then to 1400 C in 8 hours. Initiation of reaction was observed by gas evolution inducing an increase in pressure when the temperature was in the range 1100 1150 C. After reaching 1400 C, arrival toward completion of the reaction was marked by a sudden drop in pressure in about 2 4 hours. However, to ensure a more complete reaction for this stage of the process, the temperature was maintained for 8 hours after which the furnace was allowed to cool down. Generally, pressure was kept below 1000 millitorrs 133.3 Pa . After the reaction, the pellets were found to have crumbled into a light gray powdery mass. The powder did not need further grinding. X ray diffraction analysis indicated TiB₂ as the only crystalline phase. The powder was then pressed into a pellet by first mixing a 4 weight percent dispersion of Carbowax 200 Union Carbide dissolved in methylene chloride and then mechanically pressing the resulting mixture at a pressure of 10 KPSI 1.5 Bar followed by isostatic pressing at 40 KPSI 6 Bar . The pellet was surrounded by boron carbide powder and placed in a carbon crucible covered with a lid. This assembly ensured that the atmosphere could be controlled around the pellet for sintering. The pellet was heated in a temperature range of 100 300 C to remove binder and then heated to about 2100 C in about 1.5 hour. After reaching that temperature, it was maintained for 2 hours after which the furnace was allowed to cool. Pressure was maintained at less than 1000 millltorr 133.3 Bar . X ray diffraction analysis again indicated TiB₂ in the crystalline phase.
