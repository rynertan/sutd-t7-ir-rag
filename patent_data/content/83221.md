# Process for making composite yarn of continuous filaments and staple fibers.

## Abstract
An improved process for making a composite yarn of staple fibers commingled with bulked continuous filaments comprises passing a yarn of crimpled continuous filaments while under tension between nip rolls which advance the yarn into a splaying zone where the filaments are permitted to contract and splay of their own accord into an open three dimensional filament network into which airborne staple fibers are projected for commingling with the filaments after which the open network is collapsed and the composite yarn is withdrawn at a slightly lower speed than that at which the nip rolls advance the feed yarn.
