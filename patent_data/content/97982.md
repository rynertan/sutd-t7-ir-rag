# FM STEREO APPARATUS METHOD

## Abstract
An output matrix adapted to receive an L R signal component made up of the sum of L and R stereo components and an L R signal component, and to combine these in a manner to produce a separate L output and a separate R output, with certain modifications to the outputs. The higher frequency portion of the L R signal is passed through a detector which, in turn, causes a leading edge amplifier to transmit to the matrix only those signal portions where there is a relatively abrupt change of amplitude, these being the signal portions which contain the main stereo information which gives the directional information. Also, the L R signal component, in addition to being transmitted directly to the matrix, is directed through time delay means to produce a time delayed L R signal component that is also transmitted to the matrix. so as to provide what are called ambient sounds to the output of the matrix.
