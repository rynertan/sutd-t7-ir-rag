# Water engine.

## Abstract
A water engine 1, 40, 50 comprises two floats 12, 13 12 , 13 51, 52 arranged to reciprocate vertically in respec tive water chambers 10, 11 10 , 11 53, 54 . Water is ad mitted to each chamber in turn from a head of water and then allowed to exaust to a lower level, thereby causing the floats to rise and fall. The floats drive a pivotally mounted beam 25, 55 and power is derived from the beam movement by means of hydraulic rams 30, 62 .
