# Rebating tool.

## Abstract
A rebating tool comprising a support, three cutting edges 26, 27, 28 depending from the support and defining three sides 21, 22, 23 of a rectangle and wherein the support is adapted 30 to be struck with a hammer or other driving tool to drive said edges into a workpiece and further comprising a fourth cutting edge 4 and guide means 29, 31 therefore adapted to guide the fourth cutting edge 4 to move in a plane parallel to said rectangle to be able to co operate in use with said three cutting edges to therewith cut out a rectangular piece having depth from said workpiece.

## Claims
The claims defining the invention are as follows 1. A rebating tool comprising a support, three cutting edges depending from the support and defining three sides of a rectangle and wherein the support is adapted to be struck with a hammer or other driving tool to drive said edges into a workpiece and further comprising a fourth cutting edge and guide means therefore adapted to guide the fourth cutting edge to move in a plane parallel to said rectangle to be able to co operate in use with said three cutting edges to therewith cut out a rectangular piece having depth from said workpiece. 2. A rebating tool as claimed in claim 1, including a raised striker on the support for being struck. 3. A rebating tool as claimed in claim 1, wherein said fourth cutting edge has a striker for being struck. 4. A rebating tool as claimed in claim 1, wherein said support has abutments whereby the tool may be brought into abutting relation with a side edge of the workpiece. 5. A rebating tool as claimed in claim 4,wherein those abutments include a portion in alignment with one of the cutting edges to facilitate positioning. 6. A rebating tool as claimed in claim 1, wherein one or more of the cutting edges has a serrated edge. 7. A rebating tool as claimed in claim 1, wherein the fourth cutting edge is captured to the support. 8 A rebating tool as claimed in claim 7, wherein the support is provided with attachment means for attaching it to the said workpiece. 9. A rebating tool substantially as hereinbefore described with reference to any one of the drawings.

## Description
This invention relates to rebating, In a particular aspect this invention relates to a tool for rebating. In a more particular aspect this invention relates to a tool for forming rebates for hinges. A rebate fora hinge in a door and an associated doorframe usually involves the cutting of rectangles of wood from a stile of the door and a stile of a doorframe which are of particular height, width and depth and positioned with respect to particular edges of the stile of the door and the stile of the doorfrarne. Such rectangles of wood are not easily cut by any but an experienced person to the precision usually desired. Such a rectangles, if incorrectly cut, may require recutting or packing if an ill hanging door is not to result. The present invention seeks to provide a rebating tool which, while primarily useful in cutting rebates for hinges, may be put to other uses such as in cutting rebate for certain kinds of locks and window stays. The present invention provides a rebating tool comprising a support, three cutting edges depending from the support and defining three sides of a rectangle and wherein the support is adapted to be struck with a hammer or other driving tool to drive said edges into a workpiece and further comprising a fourth cutting edge and guide means therefor adapted to guide the fourth cutting edge to move in a plane parallel to said rectangle to be able to cooperate in use with said three cutting edges to therewith cut out a rectangular piece having depth from said workpiece, The support preferably has a raised striker for being struck. Said fourth cutting edge preferably has a striker for being struck. Said rectangle may be of an appropriate size to suit a particular hinge and since very few sizes of hinges are actually used it will suffice if said tool is provided in a limited number of sizes. Preferably said support has abutments whereby the tool may be brought into abutting relation with a side edge of the workpiece. Those abutments preferably include a portion in alignment with one of the cutting edges to facilitate positioning , One or more of the cutting edges may have a serrated edge to act as a cutting surface. The fourth cutting edge may be captured to the support. The support may be provided with attachment means for attaching it to the workpiece to be rebated. Alternatively, the support may be provided with means for attaching such attachment means to the support. A specific construction of a hinge rebate cutter in accordance with this invention will now be described with the aid of the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a perspective view of the cutter, Figure 2 is a top plan view of the cutter, Figure 3 is a front elevational view of the cutter, Figure 4 is a side view of the cutter, Figure 5 is a cross section on line 5 5 in Figure 2, and Figure 6 is a perspective view of .a rebate cut by the cutter. The cutter shown in the drawings comprises a body 1 and a movable blade 2. The movable blade 2 is rectangular, has a striker 3 and cutting edges 4, 5 and 6. The body 1 comprises a rectangular box which is open at its bottom and has a top 21, ends 22 and 23, back 24 and front 25. The ends 22 and 23 and back 24 have cutting edges 26, 27 and 28 at their lower ends. The body 1 also includes a striker 30. The front 25 depends from the top 21 two a lesser extent than the sides 22 and 23 and back 24 and that lesser extent is equal to the depth of rebate to be cut. Secured to the front are two blade guides 29 and 31 and two alignment lugs 32 and 33. The blade 2 can be received and guided by the guides 29 and 31 and pass under the front 25. In use the cutter is placed on a door stile 41 of a door 42 with the body 1 on the surface 43 and the lugs 32 and 33 on the surface 44. To facilitate positioning of the cutter it is desirable to make no more than a single mark such as is represented by dash line 46 and alignment of the lug 33 can be made with that line 46. Thereafter the striker 30 is hit with a hammer or other driving tool to drive the cutting edges 26, 27 and 28 into the surface 43 of the stile 41 to cut to a depth which will be limited by the front 25 ooming into abutment with the surface 43 of the stile 41. As a result, cuts on lines 47, 48 and 49 will be made. With the body still in position, the blade 2 is inserted into the guides 29 and 31 and its striker 3 is then hit with a hammer or other driving tool to cut with edges 4, 5 and 6 in a plane parallel to surface 43 to remove a piece of timber and so complete the rebate. Similar rebating of doorframes and other structures may be done. The above described cutter is conveniently made of metal but the use of plastics or other materials provided with metal cutting edges is not to be excluded. The claims form part oS the disclosure of this specification. Modifications and adaptations may be made to the above described without departing from the spirit and scope of this invention wich includes every novel feature and combination of features disclosed herein.
