# Electrically operated fishline tier.

## Abstract
An electrically operated, hand held tier for tying a length of fishline to a fishhook comprises a tying wheel 6 mounted rotatably on a bearing boss for rotation in one direction. The tying wheel 6 has an anchoring member 9 secured thereto for holding releasably one end portion of the fishline after the fishline has been passed through the bearing boss. One end of a fishhook opposite to its sharp point is adapted to be received in coaxial relation to the bearing boss and has a number of turns of the fishline formed thereon when the tying wheel 6 is rotated several times thereabout. The rotation of the tying wheel 6 is effective to form a knot on the fishline which is necessary to secure the fishhook to the fishline.
