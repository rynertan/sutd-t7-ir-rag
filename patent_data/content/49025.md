# Method for producing pelletized animal fodder by compression as well as apparatus for carrying out this method.

## Abstract
The invention provides a pelletized animal fodder to gether with a method for producing the same and an apparatus for carrying out this method. The fodder is produced by pelletizing the fodder components in a usual pelletizer 8 and feeding the product obtained to another pelletizer 12 , which treatment can be repeated with a third or further pelletizer. This treatment results in a higher specific hardness or better pd index of the product obtained in comparison with a single pelletizing operation with the same components or in the same specific hard ness or pd index when using a relative large amount of soft ingredients.

## Description
Animal fodder, method for producing pelletized animal fodder Dy corn pression as well as apparatus for carrying out this method. The invention relates to a new animal fodder, to a method for producing pelletized animal fodder by compression as well as to an apparatus for carrying out this method. It is generally known to produce pelletized animal fodder by compression starting from a number of raw materials either blended or not. Such pellets may be handled more easily and cause lower losses due to the formation of dust and spilling than non compressed animal fodder. For this reason among others the farmers prefer pelletized animal fodder which then should be of a sufficient hardness to prevent crumbling and agglomeration thereof during transportation and storage. Such crumbling and agglomeration might occur for instance in storage silos in which pellets may be subject to a rather high pressure locally. The lumbs and dust thus formed will then inhibit the discharge from th,Ã© silos or cause clogging of the automatic feeding systems at stock farms, while part of the meal will remain in the fodder mangers.By practical experience the producers of animal fodders know the minimum required hardness of their product. Usually the pelletizing operation is performed by means of an apparatus including a rotating annular die, the inner wall of which is engaged by one or more rollers. The die has been provided with perforations the diameter of which corresponds to the desired diameter of the pellets. The meal like animal fodder is supplied to the inside of the die, entrained by this die and pressed into the die perforations by means of the rollers. The animal fodder is discharged in compressed condition from the die at the other side thereof. The apparatus is usually provided with means for supplying steam and molasses. Likewise there are embodiments in which the meal like animal fodder is pressed by means of a roller through a flat horizontally positioned perforated die. By the hardness of the pellets there is meant both the abrasion resistance of the pellets which is measured by the rotation in a rotating drum, and also the required mean stress at which the pellets fail in compression. In the first instance one uses the term pelletdurability index pd or abrasion whereas in the latter instance one speaks about the hardness in the limited sense of the word or, if based on the diameter of the pellets, of the specific hardness. No generally employed standard procedure exists for determining this hardness. Several instruments are commercially available indeed such as the Kahl hardness tester, the Instron meter, the Allo Kramer shear press and the Pfost pellet durability or pd tester. Where no generally employed standard procedure exists the results are only comparable in as far as the same procedure has been employed. . The hardness of the pellets is effected by several factors.Among others mention may be made of the moisture content, cooling, adjustment of the pelletizer, use of steam, use of hardening materials, selection of the die, etc. As is apparent from the literature I.Foeller et al, die Muehle und Mischfuttertechnik 115, 1978, nr.33, pages 473 475, W.Friedrich et al, Kraftfutter 1968, nr. 1 and 2, pages 59 63, W.Friedrich et al, the Muehle und Mischfuttertechnik, 116, 1979, nr.39, pages 527 530 these frequently come to avail. By means of the known methods it is however impossible to produce sufficiently hard pellets under the currently applied pelletizing conditions when utilizing relatively large amounts of so called soften ing raw materials like for instance tapioca meal, fats and coco nut meal. Such raw materials are frequently available however and are also of good food value. The normal pelletizing method comprises the followig steps The meal to be pelletized which either blended or not may be stored in a cell is supplied to a metering device, for instance by means of a metering jack and then metered to the blender for instance by means of a metering jack of adjustable rotational speed. Optionally molasses, vinasse i.e. fermented molasses from which the alcohol produced is removed and or other fluids may be added in the blender.Optionally steam may be supplied to the blender. Ther meal is passed through the blender whereupon the meal is blended or not with the fluids and or the steam in practice such a treatment requires 5 60 seconds . The product obtained is then passed to an ageing tank heat retention tank or not and thereafter kept at the same temperature for some time 3 60 minutes while agitating slowly and optionally supplying steam or heating indirectly. The product is then supplied to the pelletizer entrained there through. The pellets obtained from the pelletizer are cooled down for instance by passing air at ambiant temperature there through, preferably by suction. The pellets obtained are sifted and the meal thus removed often 5 20 is returned to the process. Finally the cooled and sifted pellets are discharged to the storage of product or filled in sacks.Common pellet diameters for the pelletized fodder are 5 8 mm for cattle and cows, 3 6 mm for hogs and pigs and 2 4 mm for poultry. Of course deviation therefrom is possible. Surprisingly it has now been found that when using the same raw materials a harder pellet or when using a relatively larger amount of the so called softening raw materials just as hard a pellet may be obtained, respectively, when the material obtained in the known way is pelletized again. It is of advantage to supply the pellets obtained by the first pelletizing operation directly to a subsequent pelletizer. Accordingly it is not necessary to grind the pellets thus obtained to fines again. The operation may be repeated several times, if desired. It is completely unexpected that pelletizers designed for converting meal like substances to pellets pellets, strands, cubes, splits, bits, crumbs, etc. are also quite capable of converting a material consisting for 100 of large pellets. One would expect that such large pellets would not be fit for seizure by the roller because at the locations where the pellet engages both the roller and the die the wedge angle is larger than in case of small particles like in case of a meal. An improper seizure of the particles would lead to a damming of the material next to and in front of the rollers, such being conducive to a complete filling of the pelletizer and a stagnation of the production. It is known for that matter that pelletizers are operated at the thickness of the meal layer on the inside of the die of 2 3 mm. It now appeared that pellets having a diameter of even 10 mm and an even greater length may be processed excellently on a pelletizer of the usual type. Likewise one would expect that due to the deformation in the subsequent pelletizing operation the existing bonds between the particles will be destroyed, this being conducive to a lower hardness. Surprisingly however just the opposite appears to occur. Finally one would expect that fats which upon repeated compression will be pressed out of plant cells would be conducive to a less strong pellet just like the addition of separately added fats. It appears however that the pellet bocomes stronger. No explanation has as yet been found for the greater hardness of this so called two or more step pellets. The second or subsequent pelletizing operation may be performed on a socalled denuded pelletizer, i.e. a pelletizer exempt of a supply jack or blender. The die perforations of the pelletizer for the subsequent steps may be of dimensions smaller, equalling or larger than those of the preceding step. The strands obtained from the first pelletizer may be cut at any arbitrary length or not at all. Between two steps the pellets may be cooled, ground or steamed or not. The method according to the invention opens the possibility to incorporate relatively larger amounts of high energy raw materials in the blended fodders, which would as yet be conducive to too soft a product. There is great need of such high energy blended fodders. Another ingredient offering many advantages in a blended fodder is coco nut meal. In cattle this ingredient increases the milk fat content. However this ingredient possesses a highly decreasing effect on the hardness of the fodder made into pellets. The method according to the invention opens the possibility to incorporate a larger amount of coco nut meal in the fodder blend than possible at present while attaining a sufficient pellet hardness. Examples of ingredients that may be incorporated advantageously in accordance with the method of the invention are fats, oils, linseed, palm kernels, tapioca, oats, wheat brans, rapeseed meal, barley chaff, bone meal, coco nut meal, cotton seed husks, cerial germs, corn cobs and minerals. Thus it becomes possible to prepare a fodder of comparable feed value having a sufficient hardness but containing a lower wheat and or linseed meal content. Another problem is that dairy cattle at a very high production level requires a high caloric fodder because it cannot consume a sufficient amount of low caloric fodder for satisfying its energy requirements. The addition of fat or oil seeds to the blended fodder increases the energy content thereof but the pellet strength will rather soon fall below the required minimum. When applying the method according to the invention the hardness may be increased to a sufficient level, that is to say in accordance with the invention high fat pellets having a sufficient hardness may be obtained. Hereby the milk production of milk cows may be kept at a very high level for a longer period of time. Example 1.Dairy cattle fodder usual pelletized twice by weight including a relative larger amount of soft ingredients by weight linseed 4 3 rapeseed meal 3 coco nut meal 20 corn gluten fodder meal 25 25 citrus pulp 35 35 fat 1 1 linseed scales 7 beet pulp 15 molasses 10 10 vitamins, minerals, traces 3 3 specific hardness 0.60 kg 0.62 kg do, pelletized 1 x 0.43 kg pellet diameter 6 mmCattle farmers attach great value to coco nut meal. This increases the milk fat content, is low priced but possesses a highly decreasing effect on the hardness of the pelletized fodder. By pelletizing twice an appreciable larger amount of coco nut meal may be incorporated in a composition than at present, while retaining the pellet hardness. Example II.Pig fattening fodder usual pelletized twice X by weight including a relative larger amount of soft ingredients by weight barley 20 5 wheat 30 wheat brans 21 tapioca 16 36 linseed meal 6 soya bean meal 20 20 animal fat 1 5 sun flower seed 6 vitamins, minerals, traces 3 3 molasses 4 4 specific hardness 0.40 kg 0.40 kg do, pelletized 1 x 0.25 kg pellet diameter 5 mmWheat and linmeal yield hard pellets but are high in price per one unit of feed value. The reverse holds for tapioca, fat and brans. By pelletizing twice there may thus be prepared a whole pig fodder starting from cheaper raw materials than possible until now, while retaining the pellet hardness. Example III. Dairy cattle dairy cattle fodder fodder 950 fud 1,055 fud linmeal 5 5 coco nut meal 10 10 rapeseed meal 6 6 soya bean meal 1.5 1.5 sunflower seed meal 10 10 corn gluten fodder meal 15 15 tapioca meal 7 3.8 pulp 32 32 beef tallow 1.3 4.5 molasses 10 10 minerals, vitamins, traces 2.2 2.2 specific hardness 0.40 kg 0.40 kg do, pelletized 1 x 0.27 kg pellet diameter 6 mm fodder units dairy cattle. It is of common knowledge that dairy cattle having a very high production level requires high caloric fodder because low caloric fodder cannot be consumed in sufficient amounts to satisfy the energy requirement. The addition of fat to the blended fodder increases its energy content but the pellet strength will soon fall below the required minimum. By pelletizing twice the hardness of such a high fat blended fodder may be raised above the required minimum. By pelletizing twice there may accordingly be produced a fodder having a sufficient hardness the energy content of which is higher than is possible at present. Hereby the milk production of dairy cows may be kept at a very high level for a longer period of time. Example IV. A blend comprising 44 by weight of tapioca meal, 44 by weight of coco nut meal both being known as softening raw materials, 10 by weight of molasses and 2 by weight of vitamins minerals is pelletized repeatedly. specific hardness pd index pelletized 1 x 0.25 9.80 pelletized 2 x 0.33 9,82 pelletized 3 x 0.44 9.84 pelletized 4 x 0.57 9.87 pelletized 5 x 0.65 9.89 pellet diameter 6 mmFrom the above it is apparent that one may yet further increase the strength of the pellet by repeating the pelletizing operation. The annexed drawing shows an example of an apparatus according to the invention. With reference to this drawing the numeral 1 indicates the supply of raw materials, which raw materials by way of a conveyor means 2 and a supply conduit 3 are fed to a blender 4 which blender may appropriately be in the shape of a paddle mixer.Advantageously the conveyor means 2 is of the variable speed type. Furthermore the blender 4 is provided with conduits for supplying steam and molasses, etc, 5 and 6, respectively . By way of conduit 7 the blended ingredients are fed from the blender to the pelletizing means 8 which is driven by a motor 9 and a driving gear 10. By way of conduit 11 the pellets obtained by compressive pelletizing are then fed to the second pelletizer 12 from which the pellets are discharged via conduit 13. Suitably the pelletizer 12 is also driven by the motor 9 and thje driving gear 10. One may of course also use two separtate motors and driving gears. The supply conduit 11 may be provided with lines for supplying steam and molasses but such is not required. The pelletizer means may also be of a horizontal design instead of a vertical design or may be squared with respect to each other.
