# A DEVICE FOR STRETCHING SNOW CHAINS ON WHEELS

## Abstract
The invention relates to a device for stretching snow chains on wheels or tires, by exerting a pull on at least one resiliently deformable element 16 pivotally connected to one end 10 of the mounted chain, until hooking said deformable element 16 to the opposite end 10 of the mounted chain. The device comprises a cable 34 with a handgrip 36 and a knot 38 . The cable can be inserted in an opening 26 carried by a plate 22 at the free end of the resilient element 16 and can be fixed in a groove 32 near the opposite end 10 of the mounted chain, by means of its knot 38 . By exerting a pull on said handgrip 36 the chain and the resilient element 16 are stretched until hooking a bore 24 in said plate 22 on a pin 28 carried by said chain opposite end 10 . The cable can then be detached and recovered.
