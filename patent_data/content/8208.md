# A VERTICAL INDICATING DEVICE AND A DEVICE FOR MAINTAINING A STABLE VERTICAL IN TWO DIMENSIONS

## Abstract
A gyroless vertical indicating device which tracks the local gravity vector independent of horizontal acceleration. A compound pendulum 20 and an angular accelerometer 10 each has a single rotational degree of freedom about a common axis 35 . Rotational motion of the pendulum 20 and of the angular accelerometer 10 about the axis 35 is coupled by a quartz fibre suspension 40a, 40b the realong. A signal representative of the relative angular ve locity between the pendulum 20 and the angular accele rometer 10 is fed back through a coil 50 to a torquing system 60 which maintains the pendulum s orientation along the local gravity vector.
