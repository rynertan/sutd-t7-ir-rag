# Cellulase, its preparation and microorganism used therein.

## Abstract
A process and a microorganism for synthesizing cellulase enzymes are described. The microorganism is a mutant strain of an Ascomycete fungus capable of synthesizing cellulases. The synthesis of cellulases by the mutant is nonrepressed by glycerol, repressed by glucose but not subject to postrepres sion lag, and inducible to high levels by lactose. Furthermore, the combination of lactose with xylose elicits maximum cel lulase synthesis by the mutant.
