# Thermal type overcurrent relay.

## Abstract
A thermal type eddy current relay having an improved contact operating mechanism whereby testing of the oper ation of the relay is made easy, malfunctions due to me chanical shock or the like are substantially eliminated, and the overall size of the relay is reduced. A thermal element 3 is provided for opening normally closed contacts 16,18 of the relay in response to heat produced by a heater 4 through which a main circuit current flows. An operating rod 21 is provided for closing normally open contacts in response to the operation of the normally closed contact mechanism 16,18 when the normally closed contacts are opened by the operation of the thermal element 3 . The operating rod 21 may be operated from the exterior of the housing of the relay for testing purposes.
