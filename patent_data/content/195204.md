## Description
TOY VEHICLE GUIDANCE SYSTEM Technical Field This invention pertains to toy vehicles. In particular, it pertains to a mechanism for guiding a self powered toy vehicle along a predetermined path of travel. Background Art Self powered toy vehicles are well known. Such toys are typically powered by a small electric motor, a fly wheel, or a coiled spring. Self powered toy vehicles may be allowed to run along a random path of travel, or may be contained to predetermined path of travel by a track or the like. The play value of free running self powered toy vehicles is often reduced when the toy vehicle must be operated within a confined area. On the other hand, the play value of self propelled toy vehicles confined to a fixed track is reduced by the repetitious nature of their operation. Summary of the Invention The toy vehicle guidance system disclosed herein is especially designed to confine a self powered toy vehicle to a predetermined path of travel, while minimizing repetitiousness of operation characteristic of previous toy vehicle track systems. The guidance system hereof broadly includes segments of flexible tubing, connecting links for interconnecting the flexible tube segments into a toy vehicle track, a tube capturing guidance element carried by the self powered toy vehicle, and a variety of mechanisms for randomly and selectively altering the path of travel of the toy vehicle along the track.

Lever arm stop 226 projects upwardly from the plate 190. Track defining rib 228 projects upwardly from base plate 190, and extends between the inbound edge 230 and outward bound edge 232 of the plate 190. The leading and trailing edges 234, 236 of the rib 228 comprise connecting link receptacles having longitudinal and radial channels similar to the channels 134, 136 described in conjunction with receptacles 122 above and depicted in Figs. 6 and 7. The inbound and outbound edges 230, 232 of plate 190 comprise inclined panels. The underpass overpass track connector 34 includes sidewalls 238, 240, inclined ramps 242, 244 leading upwardly to overpass panel 246, and underpass panel 248 located beneath overpass panel 244. Sidewalls 238, 240 extend above the surfaces of the ramp and overpass panels, and include arcuate leading edges 250. Track defining rib 252 projects upwardly from inclined ramps 242, 244 and overpass panel 246, and underpass track defining rib 254 projects upwwardly from the surface of the underpass panel 248. The underpass track rib 252 is oriented generally perpendicular to the overpass track rib 254. The terminal ends of the overpass and underpass ribs 252, 254 comprise track connecting link receiving receptacles. The underpass overpass connecting link receptacles include longitudinal and radial channels similar to those described in connection with receptacles 122, and depicted in Figs.6 and 7. Obstacle course tracks connector 36 broadly includes base plate 256, terrain simulating projections 258, track connection assemblies 260, 262, and slide assembly 264. Referring to Fig. 17, track connection assemblies 260, 262 comprise connecting link receiving receptacles having longitudinal and radial channels 134, 136, similar to the channels described in connection with the receptacles 122, and depicted in Figs. 6 and 7. The connection assemblies 260, 262 are located on inclined surfaces 266, 268, respectively. The track connection assemblies 260, 262 each include inwardly facing, track tube receiving prongs 270 having serrated surfaces. Access ports 272 are located within base plate 256 immediately below the prongs 270. Slide assembly 264 includes track tube receiving terminal 274 and lever 276. The terminal 274 is received through slot 278 of base plate 256, and referring to Fig.16 , is pivotally mounted to slide lever 276. The lever 276 is received within guide ridges 280 on the bottom surface of the plate 256, and by support flanges 282. The terminal 274 includes cylindrical midportion 284 having a diameter equal to the diameter of the external track sidewall 40. Opposed, serrated surface prongs 286 extend axially, outwardly from each end of the terminal midportion. The prongs 286 are integrally connected to the midportion 284 via frusto conical portions 288. Pivot pin 290 is received within pin receiving cavity 292 of the terminal midportion 284. Lengths of track tubing 20 extend between the terminal 274 and each connection assembly 260, 262. In operation, vehicle guidance element 22 is snapably received within the bracket 86 of the underside of toy vehicle 58. Referring to Fig. 2, the toy vehicle 58 is positioned on track 20 with the front and rear ground engaging wheels 60, 62 straddling the tubular track 20.The track 20 is received within the track capturing channel 96 defined by the guidance flanges 92, 94 of guidance element 22. The front wheels 60 are preferably carried in noncontacting relationship with the ground when the track 20 is properly received within the track capturing channel 96. The rear wheels 62 are properly in engagement with the ground, for transmission of motive force from the vehicle s motor, through the rear wheels to the ground. Referring to Fig. 18, two track segments 20 may be easily and quickly interconnected by a tube segment connecting link 24. In particular, insertion pins 44 of the link 24 are received within the track segments 20 in a frictional fit. The link prongs 52, and in particular the semi spherical ends of the link prongs 52 tightly engage the internal track tube sidewall 38. As noted hereinabove, the diameter of the tip prongs 52, as measured between the external, curved surfaces of the prong semi spherical ends 54, is slightly greater than the diameter of the internal track tube sidewall. Prong tip semi cylindrical posts 56 are resilient, and exert an outwardly directed biasing force, through the prong ends 54, against the internal track tube sidewalls, thereby contributing to the tight fit of the connecting links 24 within the track segments 20. Referring to Fig. 6, it will be appreciated that the resilient nature of the connecting link insertion pin tips, and in particular the semi cylindrical posts 56 and semi spherical ends 54, contribute to the tight fit of the connecting links within receptacles 122 on the track intersection connector 26, receptacles 133, 135, 137, 140 on the three into one junction connector 32, and on all similar receptacles on the various track connector mechanisms described hereinabove. The toy vehicle 58 is guided onto the track intersection connection 26 by the track segments 20 connected to the receptacles 122. The center boss 120 of the track intersection connector 26 is positioned to be captured within the track capturing channel 96 of the vehicle guidance element 22 as the toy vehicle 58 transits across the plate 118 of the intersection connector 26. In this manner, the toy vehicle 58 is guided between opposed receptacles 122 on the intersection connector 26, without the presence of interfering structure on the plate 118, to inhibit vehicle movement in the cross direction over the intersection connector 26. The toy vehicle 58 is guided onto three into one junction connector 32 by track segments 20 connected to any of the inward bound receptacles 135, 137, 140.The path of travel of the vehicle 58 is as indicated by the arrows in Fig. 13. Each of the inbound receptacles 135, 137, 140 are directed towards the outward bound receptacle 133. The toy vehicle 58, therefore, transits across three into one junction connector plate 131, and is captured by the outward bound receptacle 131. As will be appreciated, more than one toy vehicle 58 may approach the three into one junction connector 32 at the same time, resulting in a collision of the toy vehicles 58 and derailment ot one or both cars. The toy vehicle 58 is guided onto the track switching connector 30 by the track segment 20 connected to inward bound receptacle 60. The path of travel of the toy vehicle 58 is as indicated by the arrows in Fig. 9.The pivotal track portion 174 can be shifted by lever 176 so as to align the inward bound receptacle 160 with any of the three outward bound receptacles 162, 164, 166.The toy vehicle 58 can therefore be selectively directed to any one of three distinct track routes by the connector 30. Toy vehicle 58 is guided through the lap counter track connector 28, along track rib 228, in the direction of travel indicated by the arrow in Fig. 8. Gate 204 pivots about the post 208 as the vehicle contacts lever 218.The gate pawl abutting surface 218 contacts the aligning arm 216 of C shaped pawl 200, as the gate is pivoted about the post 208. The C shaped pawl 200, in turn, pivots about pivot post 206, urging the pawl actuating arm 212 into contact with the ratchet wheel 222 of pawl 192. At the same time, pawl stopping arm 214 is shifted to a ratchet wheel clearing position, allowing the ratchet wheel 222 and, attached numbered surface 220, to rotate by one step.Leaf spring 202 urges the C shaped pawl back to its rest position, after the toy vehicle 58 has passed through the gate 2Q4, shifting the C shaped pawl 200 back to its rest position. Shifting of the pawl 200 to its rest position in turn urges gate 204 to return to its rest position, with gate lever arm 218 abutting arm stop 226. Toy vehicle 58 is guided over tha inclined ramps 242, 244 and overpass panel 246 of underpass overpass track connector 34 by track defining rib 252. The toy vehicle 58 is guided along the underpass panel 248 of the underpass overpass track connector 34 by track defining rib 254. The toy vehicle 58 is guided through the obstacle course track connector 36 by the track tube segments 20 interconnecting the shiftable terminal 274 and the track connection assemblies 260, 262. Referring to Fig. 16, the path of travel of the toy vehicle 58 through the obstacle course can be altered by shifting slide assembly 264, and thereby repositioning the tube segments 20 on the plate 256. In particular, marker cones 294 may be randomly placed on the obstacle course base plate 256, and the track segments 20 of the obstacle course can be manipulated by the slide assembly 264 such that the toy vehicle 58 is navigated between the marker cones 294. The unique and simple construction of the tubular track segments 20 and tube segment connecting links 24 allows a child to quickly and easily layout and change toy vehicle track configurations. Moreover, the flexible nature of the tubular segments allows for random shifting of the track as the toy vehicle 58 proceeds along the track. The various track connectors described herein allow for the selective or random shifting of the toy vehicle s path of travel. The toy vehicle guidance system herein disclosed confines a self powered toy vehicle to a predetermined path of travel, while minimizing the repetitious nature of operation that is characteristic of previous toy vehicle track systems.
