# Ophthalmic lens.

## Abstract
A contact or spectacle of implant lens 1 has positive dif fractive power which introduces negative longitudinal chro matic aberration that more than counteracts, and is preferably greater than twice, the natural positive longitudinal chromatic aberration of the eye. The residual negative longitudinal chro matic aberration enables the eye brain system to perform tasks by concentrating on the appropirate colour component at the different respective distances without need to accommodate.
