## Description
The invention relates to a polymer composition on the basis of a graft copolymer and a copolymer of styrene and maleic anhydride. Copolymers of styrene and maleic anhydride are known plastics that possess an extremely high dimensional stability under heat. Depending on the maleic anhydride content, the heat distortion tem perature HDT may be between 100 and 165 C. The impact strength of this type of plastics, however, is low. Objects made of them generally are brittle. From US patent 3,642,949 it is known to mix styrene maleic anhydride copolymers with a graft copolymer of a vinyl aromatic compound and a nitrile compound on a rubber. According to said patent, use is made of a copolymer of styrene and, for instance, maleic anhydride with a maleic anhydride content of 5 35 wt. , in combination with a graft copolymer having a rubber content of 30 75 wt. From British patent 1,315,219 polymer compositions are known that consist on the one hand of a styrene maleic anhydride copolymer with a rather low maleic anhydride content and on the other of a styrene acrylonitrile graft copolymer. The polymer compositions described in these publications from the early seventies did, however, not lead to a commercially sucessful product, perhaps because the various parameters playing a part in the preparation of the compositions are extremely critical. The subject invention relates to a polymer composition on the basis of a styrene maleic anhydride copolymer and a graft copolymer of a vinyl aromatic compound and acrylonitrile on a rubber, yielding on the one hand a good HDT and or Vicat temperature, while on the other hand the impact strength of the product made of such a polymer com position is extremely good. The polymer composition according to the present invention is characterized in that it comprises It has, surprisingly, been found that a highly specific selection of the maleic anhydride content of the styrene maleic anhydride copolymer, of the rubber content of the graft copolymer, and of the maleic anhydride content of the polymer composition, results in a polymer composition with an optimal balance of properties. For an expert, this is unexpected, for there already are very many publica ties in the field of polymer compositions on the basis of the com bination of the proportionally high content of maleic anhydride and the high rubber content. One would expect the processability and the thermal stability during processing to be minimal. The latter factor would lead to a product having only mediocre mechanical properties and an unacceptable appearance. The polymer composition preferably contains 10 80 parts by weight of styrene maleic anhydride copolymer, 20 90 parts by weight of graft copolymer and, optionally, 5 50 parts by weight of styrene acrylonitrile copolymer. The ratios between the several components are determined by the desired properties of the end product. If the impact strenght needs not be very high, a higher styrene acrylonitrile copolymer con tent may be chosen. There is advantage in applying a graft copolymer having a rubber content of at most 80 wt. , more in particular of 60 80 wt. . This rubber is preferably chosen from the group consisting of polybu tadiene, butadiene styrene rubber, butadiene acrylonitrile rubber, butadiene acrylate rubber, acrylate rubber, ethylene propylene rubber, ethylene propylene diene rubber, and mixtures of two or more of these rubbers. The graft copolymer can be prepared in the known way, e.g. by emulsion, suspension, solution and or mass polymerization. The custo mary additives are applied, such as emulsifiers, suspending agents, free radical donors, optionally in combination with a redox system, chain length regulators, stabilizers, etc. As vinyl aromatic compound in the graft copolymer, use is generally made of styrene or a styrene derivative, such as α methyl styrene. The styrene maleic anhydride copolymer can be prepared in the manner customary for a statistic, non alternating styrene maleic anhydride copolymer. A possible process is described by Hanson and Zimmermann, Ind. Chem. Eng. Vol. 49, No. 11, November 1957, pp. 1803 through 1807. However it is done, it is essential that the polymeriza tion be effected continuously with proper stirring, since otherwise an alternating copolymer of styrene and MA is obtained, possibly in com bination with a styrene homopolymer. The styrene maleic anhydride copolymer may contain 0.1 5 wt. of other monomers, such as acrylonitrile or methylmethacrylate. This, however, is not necessary. The styrene maleic anhydride copolymer will generally be polymerized by solution or mass polymerization, since the water containing emulsion or suspension systems give rise to hydroly sis of maleic anhydride to free maleic acid, which is undesirable. The styrene acrylonitrile copolymer can be prepared in a known way, for instance by mass, solution, emulsion or suspension polymerization or combination of these. The polymer composition can be prepared in the customary way by mixing of the various components, e.g. in the melt in a single or double screw extruder, a Brabender, or a comparable mixing device. In this phase of the preparation process of the polymer composition, the customary additives can be incorporated in the polymer composition. Examples of this type of additive are colourants, pigments, fillers, whether or not reinforcing, fibres, stabilizers, lubricants, anti oxidants, plasticizers, mould release agents, etc. On the basis of a graft copolymer obtained by polymerization of styrene and acrylonitrile in the presence of polybutadiene, which graft copolymer contains 80 wt. rubber, and a styrene maleic anhydride copolymer with 27.5 wt. of MA, three polymer compositions were prepared by mixing of the various components in the presence of the customary additives, granulating and injection moulding. The com position and results are included in Table A. On the basis of the same SMA as in Example I and a graft copolymer of 31 parts by weight of a mixture of styrene and acrylo nitrile on 69 parts by weight of EPDM rubber AES , a polymer com position was prepared on the basis of 32 parts by weight of the graft copolymer and 68 parts by weight of SMA. The Vicat temperature was 124 C, the glass transition temperature Tg was 154 C, and the impact strength 19.1 kJ m².
