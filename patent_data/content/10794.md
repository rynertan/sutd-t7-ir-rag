## Description
Device for participating to a program emitted by a media.The present invention concerns a device for participating to a program emitted by a media.Media as herein used means television, radio, video discs and tapes, cassettes etc.In its simplest form, a device according to the invention consists in the combination of a receiver decoder a first memory connected to said decoder a keyboard connected to a second memory a comparator intended to mutually compare the contents of said two memories and of a locking unlocking circuit piloted by the output of said comparator and inserted in a connection between said decoder and a display.In order to better understand the invention, the latter is hereinafter described with reference to the two appended blockdiagrams respectively Figure 1 and Figure 2 which each show one form of embodiment of the invention.The device according to Figure 1 substantially comprises a receiver 1 with decoder 2, an output 3 of which being connected with a first memory 4. Data can be fed by the user into a second memory 5 by means of a keyboard 6 A comparator 7 allows to mutually compare the contents of the memories 4 and 5. The output of comparator 7 pilots a locking unlocking circuit 8 controlling the connection between a second output 9 of decoder 2 and a display 10.The receiver 1 is intended to receive signals provided to that effect in a program, the latter being emitted by a media.Said program can for instance be a television program, whereby a number of viewers are each in possession of a device according to the invention. During the emission of the program, a number of questions are put with the intention of selecting a winner amongst the viewers.Each time that a question is put, the exact answer thereto is emitted in the shape of a series of pulses which can only be detected by the receivers 1. These pulses or information are temporarily kept in memory 4. Each viewer types his answer by means of keyboard 6, which loads memory 2. The contents of memories 4 and 5 are mutually compared, in each device, and the results of such successive comparisons are added to one another in said comparator 7. At a chosen moment, the exact total is emitted together with a message for instance a telephone number.If the total in the comparator 7 coincides with the exact total, then the locking unlocking circuit allows said telephone number to appear on display 10. The first viewer who calls this number is the winner.If no viewer has obtained the exact total, decreasing values can be emitted until a winner is found.In the example according to Figure 2, the results of the comparisons made by comparator 7 are successively loaded in a third memory 11. The exact succession of correct answers is emitted and loaded in the fourth memory 12. Both contents of memories 11 and 12 are then compared in a comparator 13, the output signal of which piloting the locking circuit 8.The date fed into the device by the user can be visualized on the display 10 before being loaded in memory 5. In this case, the keyboard 6 shall be provided with an ENTER key.This allows to correct answers or modify answers before they are finally loaded.The start and length of the allocated answering time can also be defined. A locking circuit 14, piloted by decoder 2, can therefore be provided between the keyboard 6 and the memory 2. It is evident that the device according to the invention can be adapted to various medias. It is indeed sufficient to adapt receiver 1 to the signalling possibilities of the considered media.The keyboard 6 can be provided with alphanumeric keys, function keys, signalization lamps or diodes, etc.The diagrams hereto appended are given solely for illustrative purposes considering that other configurations are of course possible within the scope of the invention.
