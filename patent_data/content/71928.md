# Thick film conductor compositions.

## Abstract
Metallization suitable for making printed thick film terminations comprising an admixture of finely divided particles of palladium silver as the conductive phase and bismuth free low melting, low viscosity devitri fiable glass as the binder phase. The composition optio nally contains a spinel forming metal oxide to raise substrate adhesion.
