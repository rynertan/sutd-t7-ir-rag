## Abstract
A machine tool for machining rotating workpieces at high rotational speeds and, in particular, with multiple tool movements within a revolution of the workpiece 46 com prises a low inertia high torque motor 18, 51, 101, 150 having an output shaft 19, 52, 102, 151 and a tool holder 21, 54, 108, 154 mounted for movement relatively to the motor. A cam 20, 53, 104, 153 or other single element connection drivably connects the output shaft 19, 52, 102, 151 and the tool holder 21, 54, 108, 154 and the motor can be operated by control apparatus to so oscillate the output shaft that the tool is moved rapidly back and forth in phase with the output shaft oscillation and in correspondence with the rotation of the workpiece to perform required machining movements.
