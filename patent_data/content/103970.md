# AMINE SALTS AND PRODUCTS CONTAINING THEM

## Abstract
A water soluble salt is formed between an alkaloid and a polymeric acid and contains at least 40 by weight of the alkaloid. The alkaloid is generally nicotine and the polymeric acid is generally a polysaccharide that has been modified by carboxyalkylation or reaction with a polybasic acid. The resultant salt can be formed as a film, a particulate solid or as an aqueous solution and the solution can be used for printing.
