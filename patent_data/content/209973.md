# Protection arrangement for a telephone subscriber line interface circuit.

## Abstract
The contacts of an isolation relay 18 are positioned be tween a line interface circuit 10 and the associated feed re sistors 16 , the relay being controlled to open the contacts in response to an excessive common mode alternating current through the feed resistors. The common mode a.c. is detected by a sensing amplifier 20 , and is integrated and compared with a threshold level zero crossing predictor 24 enables the detector unit to control the isolation relay and open its con tacts at a zero crossing of the a.c. A phase shifter in the zero crossing predictor compensates for the response delay of the isolation relay. As the excessive current is now interrupted, the sensing amplifier responds to the line voltage. When this falls below a predetermined peak level, a delayed resetting of the protection arrangement is automatically effected.
