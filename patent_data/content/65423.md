# Method and appratus for compiling digital image information.

## Abstract
Video data bus 8, video memory modules VM1 VMN and bus arbitration circuits BAC1 BACN interact to provide digital image information for display. Data processor 1 addresses the video memory modules via bus 2, in order to assign a priority value to picture element data stored in the video memory modules. Upon command of the data proces sor, a frame 5 or 300 of picture element data is serially compiled on bus 8. Contention between Video memory modules for access to the video data bus is controlled by the bus arbitration circuits, the highest priority value of the picture element data gaining access. In one embodiment, the priority value represents the depth of a point of a solid object for display and or the relative depth of picture ele ment data comprising the object for display. The data pro cessor may change the priority value associated with pic ture element data for display as well as the coordinates of data location in the display. Accordingly, textual characters having the highest priority and solid objects having a lesser priority may appear to move in front of one another on a background having the lowest priority value without inter ference in a sequence of frames of information for display.
