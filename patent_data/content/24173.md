# Timing apparatus for delaying opening of doors.

## Abstract
Opening of a door 20 such as an emergency door is delayed by encumbering a security device, such as for exam ple a latch bolt 26 with the task of throttling a hydraulic fluid through a circuit, which circuit includes a normally open valve 81 held closed by a solenoid 85 . When the solenoid is de energised the circuit is opened allowing the security device 26 to move so that the door 20 can be opened. The solenoid 851 is controlled by an electrical timing circuit 101 which delays de energisation of the solenoid. The timing cir cuit is started by a switch 120 mounted to be operated by movement of the latch bolt 26 . Preferably in a situation where there are a plurality of doors, doors proximate to one another are delayed by the same electronic circuit. In a prefer red embodiment the electronic timing circuit is set to de energise the solenoid at a time subsequent to the delay result ing from throttling the fluid.
