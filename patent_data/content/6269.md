# Elements for magnetic heads, magnetic heads manufactured with these elements, methods for producing both.

## Abstract
High density multitrack magnetic heads are batch fabricated from a stack of non magnetic wafers 10 which are photolithographically processed to provide lands 62a d, 88a b and recessed structures 64, 90 in the wafers. Magnetic layers 76, 94 are deposited within the recessed structures and, within some of the grooves, coils 70 inductively coupled to the magnetic layers are also deposited. The combined thickness of the magnetic layers and coils or of the layers themselves is less than the depth of the recessed structures, with the wafer lands serving both to provide track to track spacing and to protect the magnetic layers from magnetostriction producing stresses. A selected number of grooved wafers are bonded together, sliced and then processed as generally done in the art to produce a plurality of multitrack magnetic heads.
