# High frequency high voltage power supply.

## Abstract
A high frequency high voltage power supply is de scribed, in which a high frequency high voltage is generated with the aid of L C oscillation on the high voltage side without making use of high frequency primary power supply and a high frequency high voltage converter. Among two D.C. high voltage power supplies A and B, a negative output terminal of one power supply A and a positive output terminal of the other power supply B are connected together and then connected to one of high frequency high voltage output terminals, tank capacitors having a sufficiently large electrostatic capacitance Co as compared to an electrostatic capacitance C
