# OLEFIN POLYMER STRETCH CLING FILM

## Abstract
Olefin polymer films composed essentially of a copoly mer of a major proportion of ethylene with a minor proportion of a higher Î± olefin monomer and an effective amount of a trackifying agent are provided which have unusually high Elmendorf tear strength in the machine direction, a good balance of machine direction to transverse direction Elmendorf tear strengths, and excellent cling properties. Such films are exceptionally well suited for use as a stretch cling film in various packaging and palletizing applications.
