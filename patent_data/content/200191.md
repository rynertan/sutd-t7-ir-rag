# READ CIRCUIT FOR FLOPPY DISK DRIVE

## Abstract
In a read circuit for an FDD, a differentiator is constituted by a pair of current control transistors 15, 17 connected differentially, and a series circuit of a capacitor 23 , an inductor 25 , and first and second resistors 27, 29 con nected between the transistors 15, 17 . A switch is con nected across one 29 of the resistors 27, 29 . When a track counter 34 detects an inner track, it supplies an active signal to the switch. The switch is closed to short circuit the resistor 29 , thereby decreasing the damping value of the differen tiator.
