# Rapidly dissolved water soluble polymer compositions and a method for dissolving them without agglomeration.

## Abstract
Water soluble polymers are rapidly dissolved in water without agglomeration by using a concentrate of i a water soluble particulate polymer such as an ethylene oxide polymer having an average molecular weight between 100.000 and 5.000.000, ii a water insoluble organic vehicle which is a non solvent for the polymer such as a prtroleum based liquid hydrocarbon iii a non ionic surfactant agent having an HLB in the range of 3 to 5 or 9 to 13 and, if necessary, a thickeving agent.
