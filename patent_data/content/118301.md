# Delivery drive for glassware forming machine.

## Abstract
A drive system for acuately oscillating the gob guiding units of the delivery system of a rotating table type glassware forming machine. The drive means includes a drive shaft 302 having a crank 304 and associated crank roller 306 at one end, the roller being operatively situated within a crank box 308 on one of the gob guiding units. Rotating of the drive shaft causes oscillatory motion of the gob guiding unit. A connecting link 310 is provided to transfer this motion to other gob guiding units.
