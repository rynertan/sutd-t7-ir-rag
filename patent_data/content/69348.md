# Foldable device.

## Abstract
A foldable device is disclosed, particularly suitable for presenting exhibition displays or the like, which comprises a plurality of generally rectangular planar members 204, 206, 208 pivotally connected end to end in such a way that, in a folded condition of the device, the planar members lie in face to face engagement with one another. The pivotal connec tion between any two pivotally connected planar members comprises connecting members 210 each pivotally con nected with both the planar members for pivoting about respective axes co planar with the planar members, and inter meshing gear segments 212 carried on the planar members and concentric with the respective axes.
