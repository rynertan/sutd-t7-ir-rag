# IONICALLY POLYMER BOUND TRANSITION METAL COMPLEX FOR PHOTOCHEMICAL CONVERSION OF LIGHT ENERGY

## Abstract
Novel catalyst for the photochemical conversion and storage of radiant energy through the conversion of strained cyclic non conjugated carbon containing compounds to their corresponding conjugated forms comprises ionically bonding a transition metal complex having a suqare planar geometry and multiple sites of coordination with an ion exchange resin. The novel catalyst can be made by forming an acid salt deriva tive of the transition metal complex and mixing it together with an anion exchange resin. Addition of the novel catalyst is added to a strained cyclic non conjugated carbon containing compound results in the release of heat energy through the conversion of the non conjugated carbon containing com pound to its conjugated form. The non conjugated carbon con taining compound and the catalyst may be in compartments in a sealed container means which are separated until heat energy is required. The means of separation is then broken and the non conjugated carbon containing compound is converted to the conjugated form with the release of heat energy. A process and apparatus is also provided wherein the conjugated carbon containing compound is exposed to radiant energy and is con verted to the non conjugated form and the non conjugated form is then combined with the novel catalyst converting the non conjugated form to the conjugated form and resulting in the release of heat energy which is collected.
