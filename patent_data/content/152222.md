## Description
LINEAR MOTOR BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a linear motor constructed into a mode that a corresponding electric rotary machine is split and developed. There are known linear motors of the type constructed in such a manner that in a corresponding two pole three phase full pitch double layer type electric rotary machine with 600 phase belts, three double layer wound phase belts belonging to three phases U, V and W respectively and corresponding to one pole are split into top and bottom coil sides as well as the respective split phase belts for the bottom and top coil sides belonging to the phases U and W are split from respective phase belts for the bottom and top coil sides belonging to the phases W and U and corresponding to the other pole to be continuous to the same and then the split phase belts are developed into a linear form with the remaining unsplit double layer wound phase belts to form a primary winding of the linear motor. The resulting primary winding has included three single layer wound phase belts on each of the end portions thereof belonging to the three phases U, V and W respectively and corresponding to the one pole and three double layer wound phase belts on an intermediate portion thereof belonging to the three phases U, V and W respectively and corresponding to the other pole so as to be sandwiched between the single layer wound phase belts belonging to the phases W and U and corresponding to the are pole Also the coil side as initially called top or bottom disposed in each of slots included in the single layer would phase belt belonging to each phases and located on each of the end portions of the linear winding is connected to the bottom or top coil side disclosed in each of slots included in the phase belt belonging to the same phase and located on the intermediate portion thereof to form a diamond shaped coil.This is because the two pole three phase full pitch double layer type electric rotary machine has been split and developed as described above. The linear motor constructed as described above has a three phase sinusoidal alternating current flowing through the primary winding including a plurality of the diamond shaped coils. At a time point when an instantaneous magnitude of a V phase current is a U and a W phase current are equal in magnitude and opposite in sense to each other.Under these circumstances the phase belts forming the winding has an instantaneous distribution such that the phase belts disposed an each of the end portions are small in current magnitudes and the phase belts disposed on the intermediate portion are large in current magnitude. Thus a magnetomotive force distribution formed by integrating the instantaneous current distribution as described above is considerably distorted as compared with a two pole sinusoidal wave. This has resulted in the disadvantage that the thrust characteristic concerning a secondary stationary electrical conductor is not good. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a new and improved linear motor improved in thrust characteristic by chang ging a manner in which phase belts of a corresponding electronic machine is split.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS For a better understanding of the nature of the present invention, a conventional linear motor constructed on the basis of a three phase electric rotary machine will now be described in conjunction with Figure 1 of the drawings. Figure 1A shows in the form of a circular phase belt array a two pole three phase full pitch type electric rotary machine on the basis of which a linear motor is constructed. The arrangement illustrated comprises six pairs of radially superposed phase belts U, V and W having equal phase belt spans of 600 arranged in a circle to form a circular phase belt array.The radially inner phase belts U, V and W designated by the reference numeral 1 represent top coil sides included in the same respectively while the radially outer phase belts U, V and W designated by the reference numeral 2 represent bottom coil sides included in the same respectively. Futhermore the three pairs of radially superposed phase belts U, V and W belong to the phases U, V and W of the system respectively while those located in a righthand half as reviewed in Figure 1A of the circle correspond to one pole and those located in a lefthand half thereof correspond to the other pole. In order to construct a primary winding of a linear motor, the arrangement of Figures 1A has been previously split as shown in Figure 1B. As shown in Figure lB, the phase belt U for the top coil sides belonging to the phase U and corresponding to the one pole is radially split from the adjacent phase belt W belonging to the phase W and corresponding to the other pole, and the phase belts U, V and W corresponding to the one pole and circumferentially split into the top and bottom coil sides until the phase belt belonging to the phase W and corresponding to the one pole is radially split from the adjacent phase beltU belonging to the phase U and corresponding to the other pole. Subsequently, the phase belt array is developed so that the phase belts U, V and W for the top coil sides and those for the bottom coil sides are developed into a linear form with the radially superposed phase belts U, V and W corresponding to the other pole. Figure 1C shows the resulting structure which illustrates a conventional primary winding of a linear motor. As shown in Figure 1C, the single layer wound phase belts U, V and W circumferentially split from each other are located on both end portions of the linear structure respectively and the double layers wound phase belts U, V and W are put on the intermediate portion thereof with the respective phase belts U and W for the top and bottom coil sides forming both ends of the linear structure. From the usual connection of coil sides included in the arrangement of Figure 1A and well known in the art it will readily be seen that coil sides included in each phase belt are connected to those included in the spaced phase belt belonging to the same phase as shown in Figure 2. It is noted in Figure 2, that although a plurality of coil sides are included in each phase Dell, pair cuslnectXon of tne coil sides is shown by a single line for each phase belt only for purposes of illustration. More specifically, a single coil side located in each of integral slots not shown disposed on a primary linear core 3 and included in each of the phase belts located on either of the end portions thereof is connected via a diamond end construction of a bottom or top coil side disposed in a correspondings slot included in that phase belt belonging to the same phase as the firstmentioned phase belt, in accordance with whether the single coil side has be initially called top or bottom .For example, the coil side included in the phase belt U located on the end of the primary case 3 is connected to a corresponding bottom coils side included in the phase belt U located on the intermediate portion. This is because that single coil side has been initially called top . Thus a plurality of diamond shaped coils 4 are electromagnetically coupled to the primary linear core 3. Therefore it will reapidly be understood that the coils 4 can be easily prepared. In Figure 3 wherein the axis of ordinates represents an amplitude of accurent and the axis of abscissas represents time, there is shown a U, a V and a W phase sinusoidal alternating current flowing through the primary winding of three phase linear motors such as tt arrangemeist illustrated in Figures 1C or 2. In Figure 3 a time point T is also shown at which the V phase current has a null instantaneous magnitude while the U and W phase currents are equal in instantaneous magnitude and opposite in sense to each object. At that time point T, therefore, the arrangement shown in Figure 1C or 2 has an instantaneous current distribution shown in Figure 4A wherein the axis of ordinate represents a position of the phase belt and the axis of abscissas represents an sa amplitude of the current.The position of the phase belt is measured along the linear core 3 shown in Figure 2 or a linear array of the phase belts shown in Figure 1C starting with the upper end thereof as viewed in Figure 2 or Figure 1C. From Figure 4A it is seen that the instantaneous current distribution has an amplitude small on each of the end portions and large on the intermediate portion as will readily be understood from the wiring of the coils shown in Figure 2. It is well known that the instantaneous current distribution can be integrated into a magnetomotive force distribution. Figure 4B shows a magnetomotive force distribution resulting from the instantaneous current distribution illustrated in Figure 4A. In Figure 4B the axis of ordinates has the same meaning as that shown in Figure 4A and the axis of abscissas represents an amplitude of the magnetomotive force. It is seen in Figure 4B that the magnetomotive force is considerabls distorted as compared with a two pole sinusoidal wave distribution. This has resulted in the disadvantage that the thrust characteristic concerning associated secondary stationary electrical conductor is not good. The present invention contemplates to eliminate the disadvantage of the prior art practice as described above by changing the manner in which the arrangement ofFigure 1A is split. According to one aspect of the present invention, the phase belts belonging to any pair of adjacent phases in the circular array of Figure 1A are radially split along a boundary therebetween. For example, the phase belt U belonging to the phase U is radially split from the phase belt W belonging to the phase W adjacent to the phase U along a boundary therebetween as shown in Figure 5A. Then the circular phase belt array thus split is developed into a linear form to construct a primary winding of a linear motor. Figure 5B shows the resulting structure It is noted that, unlike the conventional arrangement of Figure 1C, the primary linear winding is of the double layer type and required to be formed of a plurality of different types of coils. Assuming that a three phase sinnosoidal current as shown in Figure 2 flows through the linear phase belt array as shown in Figure 5B, the array at a time point T illustrated in Figure 2 has an instantaneous current distribution as shown in Figure 6A wherein the axes of ordinates and abscissas have the same meaning as those shown in Figure 4A. From Figure 6A it is seen that the phase belts U and W are equal in instantaneous magnitude to each other but the phase belts U and W located at both ends of the linear core respectively are opposite in sense of the current to the phase belts U and W located on the middle portion thereof. In Figure 6B wherein the axes of ordinates and abscissas are the same in meaning as those illustrated inFigure 4B, there is shown a magnetomotive force distribution resulting from the integration of the instantaneous current distribution shown in Figure 6A. From Figure 6B it is seen that the magnetomotive force distribution has a waveform of a magnatomotive force very close to a two pole sinusoidal waveform. This means that an associated secondary stationary electrical conductor is applied with a travelling magnetomotive force having a waveform very close to the two pole sinusoidal waveform.Thus the resulting thrust characteristic is excellent. According to another aspect of the present invention, one phase belt belonging to any selected are of the three phases of the system in the circular phase belt array of Figure 1A is radially split so as to be circumferentially halved as shown in Figure 7A.Following this the phase belt array thus split is developed into a linear form. The resulting structure is shown in Figure 7B. A linear phase belt away shown in Figure 7B is of the double layer type as that shown in Figure 5B and also required to be formed of a plurality of different types of coils. When the linear phase belt array shown in Figure 7B is flowed with the three phase currents as illustrated inFigure 3, the same at the time point T as described above has an instantaneous current distribution as shown in Figure 8A wherein the axes of ordinates and abscissas are the same in meaning as those shown in Figure 4A. As shown in Figure 6A the phase belts W and U following the halved phase belt V at the upper end as viewed in Figure 6A of the linear away have respective instantaneous currents therethrough equal in magnitude and sense to each other while being equal in magnitude and opposite in sense of an instantaneous current through end of the phase belts W and U followed by the halved phase belt V at the lower and thereof. A corresponding magnetomotive force distribution is shown at solid line a in Figure 8B wherein the axes of ordinates and abscisas are identical in meaning to those shown in Figure 4B. While the magnetomotive force distribution lies only on the postive side of the axis of ordinates. A magnetomotive force waveform very close to a two pole sinusoidal waveform can be provided as shown at dotted and dashed line c in Figure 8B by removing a rectangular waveform b extended throughout the entire length of the linear phase belt away as shown at dotted line b in Figure 8B. Since a magnetomotive force in the rectangular waveform b can be interpreted as an AC magnetomotive force, the same does not affect the thrust characteristic concerting a secondary stationary electrical conductor.Thus the secondary stationary electrical conductor is applied with a travelling magnetomotive force having a waveform very close to the two pole sinusoidal waveform. This results in an excellent thrust characteristic. From the foregoing it will readily be understood that according to the present invention, a primary winding of a linear motor is constructed in the similar manner that, in a phase belt away expressed by a corresponding two pole, three phase, full pitch type electric rotary machine two phase belts belonging to any pair of adjacent phases of the system are radially split from each other along a boundary therebetween and the phase belt allay is developed into a linear form. Alternatively one phase belt belonging to any of the three phases of the system may be radially split so as to be circumferentially halved and the phase belt array is developed into a linear form. Thus the resulting linear motorsare excellent in thrust characteristic. While the present invention has been illustrated and described in conjunction with a few preferned embodiments thereof it is to be understood that numorous changes and modifications may be resorted to without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. For example, the present invention has been described in conjunction with the two pole electric rotary machine, but it is to be understood that the present invention is equally applicable to three phase full pitch electric rotary machines having four or more poles with the result somewhat inferior to that exhibited by the two pole machine.
