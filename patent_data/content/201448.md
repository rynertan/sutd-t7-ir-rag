# Thread cutting die head for power driven threading machines.

## Abstract
An annular thread cutting die head 26 for a power driven threading machine is comprised of an annular sup port plate 32 supporting a plurality of radially displaceable thread cutting dies 44 spaced apart about the axis A of the die hed 26 , and an annular cam plate assembly 34 coaxial with and pivotal relative to the support plate 32 to radially displace the cutting dies 44 . The cam plate assembly 34 is spring biased to pivot relative to the support plate 32 in the direction to radially retract the cutting dies 44 , and is selec tively operable relative to the support plate 32 to achieve the cutting of a straight thread or to achieve the cutting of a tapered thread. In connection with the cutting of a tapered thread, receding replacement of the cutting dies 44 is con trolled by a unique cam arrangement 132 on the machine carriage 10 engaged by the cam plate assembly 34 under the spring bias and independent of torque imposed on the die head 26 during the threading operation.
