# Handling device for downwardly discharging material from the top of the mass stored in a receptacle.

## Abstract
A material handling device is disclosed for use in a material holding, or storage, receptacle. The device includes a vertically positioned discharge duct having spaced apertures therein with the bottom of the duct connected to a discharge access passage whereby granular, free flowing material, such as grain, within the receptacle, is withdrawn through the apertures and discharge duct in a manner such that the withdrawn material is from the top of the stored mass. The apertures are either staggered or opposed with respect to one another along the discharge duct. Material loading is through the top of the receptacle with the loading duct, or channel, being formed in a manner so as to prevent damage by impact to the material being introduced.
