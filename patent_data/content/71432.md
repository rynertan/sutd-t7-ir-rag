# Fire safe expansible tube type valve.

## Abstract
An expansible tube type valve wherein a flexible tube 34 , which is sealed around its ends in a valve body 12 , is stretched to seal around a barrier 38 in the flow passage. Thin rings 52,54,56,58,60,62 of thermal insulation material are disposed around the ends of the flexible tube, interposed between it and parts of the valve body normally in contact therewith, so as to isolate the tube from the body and preclude transmission of high temperatures thereto, as in the event of a fire in the area.
