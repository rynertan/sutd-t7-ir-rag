# Angular motion paper feed release system.

## Abstract
A paper feed release system is disclosed wherein a camming member 54 is mounted on and acts with respect to the platen shaft 12 to depress a paper feed release bar 26 extending entirely across the paper feed mechanism such that only one end of said bar 26 is depressed while the second end provide a pivot 30 with respect to the frame 14 supporting the paper feed mechanism. The paper feed rolls 16, 18 and shafts 20, 22 are supported on support plates 24 which are engaged by the paper feed release bar 26 and are caused to be depressed by the pivoting movement of the paper feed release bar 26 with respect to the frame member 14 , under the influence of the camming release member 54 .
