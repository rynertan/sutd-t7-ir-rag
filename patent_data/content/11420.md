The preferred embodiment of an electronic game device as illustrated in figures 1 to 6, has one central control panel 1 and four remote controls 2 see figure 2 connected to the central control panel 1 through cables 3. The central control panel 1 is provided with a power source such as a connection 4 to the domestic electricit distribution and or a incorporated dry cell esuip ment not shots , and comprises a programmed microprocessor system, such as in particular a so called one chip micro computer not sham , which is executed in such manner that it is able to conduct and perform a number of game operations and functions as hereinafter described. Said central control panel 1 further comprises a keyboard 5 with the following control and selection means a on off switch 6 to establish the power circuit of the device a set of selection key buttons for selecting a specific gsme from those allowed by the device, i.e. a key button 7 for selecting a quizz type game Q , a key button 8 for selecting a letter game P , 2 key button 9 for selecting a dice game D and a key button 10 for selecting a symbol combination game a set of three keyboard push buttons 11, 12 and 13 for setting a playing time limit of respectively 10, 30 or 90 seconds to a selected game a set of three keyboard push buttons 14, 15 and 16 for assigning respectively 1,2 or 5 scoring points to a selected game a start pushing button 17 for starting a selected game a stop pushing button 18 for stopping a selected game a set of keyboard push buttons for performing scoring point registration for a selected game, consisting of a push button 19 for scoring point addition a push button 20 for sooring point substraction , and a push button 21 for doubling the assigned scoring points, as a kind ofJoker function J , both on the scoring point addition and substraction a correction button 22 for cancelling any wrongly keyed instruction CE a set of four keyboard pushing buttons 23, 24, 25 and 26 for recalling and displaying the scoring point total assigned to one of the remote control panels 2, respectively assigned with the sequence numeral 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 . The central control panel 1 further comprises digital display means 27, which in particular consist of one set of four 7 segment display cells 28 directed towards the keyboard side of the central control panel, and one set of four 7 segment display cells 29 directed towards that side of the central control panel to which the remote control panels 2 are connected. The outside display cells 29 are preferably of a larger size than the inside display cells 28. The central control panel 1 furthermore comprises a sound equipment, with a sound source such as a loudspeaker not shown . The body of the central control panel 1 is finally also shaped in such manner that it comprises a compartiment 31 for putting a pile of cards not shove which may contain instructions in connection with the quizz type11 6ame or the letter game of the device. Said body of the central control panel thereby also comprises a slit 32 for setting upright one such instruction card, for the duration of one game turn. Each remote control panel 2 comprises one pushing button 33 for performing player control to a selected game operation. Such player control consists in particular in stopping the performance of a function controlled by the central control panel such as time control or random symbol generation . The electronic game device according to the invention may of course comprise numerous other features instead of or in addition to those specifically described hereabove in connection with one purely illustrative example of the preferred embodiments of the invention the central control panel may thus for instance comprise further control and selection means so as to perform further monitoring and playing functions. The performance of the presently examplified embodiment of an electronic game device in accordance with the invention will be further explained hereafter having reference to the functional flow sheet of attached figure 5. Upon establishing the electric contact of the device by means of the on off switch 6, one may select one specific game among those allowed by the device, by actuating any one of the selection key buttons 7,8,9 or 10. In the presently examplified game device one may thus select among a quizz type game Q , a letter game P , a dice game D and a symbol combination game . Therefor the selection key buttons 7,8,9 and 10 perform selection among specific functions made possible by the microprocessor system of the device, and in parti cular select between a timer function and anumber of symbol generation functions. lThen thus for instance selecting the quizz type game, one uses the timer function of the microprocessor system. This auizz type game further involves setting a specific playing time by means of one of the time setting pushing buttons 1X, 12 and 13 and specific scoring points by means of one of the score setting pushing buttons 14, 15 and 16, whereby each of those selected features are displayed on the display panels 28 and 29. A specific instruction or question,to which a reply is due within the playing time is then disclosed to the players for instance by means of an instruction card not represented set upright in the slit 32 of the device, and the actual game is started by pushing the start pushing button 17 which begins running the preset playing time as displayed on the display panels. If the play is brought to an end by a central control panel stop or by a time stop running out of the preset playing time , the game system is reset at the initial situation, that is for resetting a new playing time period. If the play is however brought to an end through a stop instruction from one remote control panel 2, the game system is automatically set in a situation by which the preset scoring points are assigned to that remote control, and may be added to or substracted from the scoring point total assigned to that remote control. Depending whether the scoring points are added to the scoring total, which means that the considered player won the game turn, or are substracted from the scoring total, which means that the considered player lost the gGme turn, the game system is reset at the initial situtation or at a point where the game goes on with the remaining players When for instance selecting the letter game of the examplified device, one uses the symbol generation function of the microprocessor system, more particularly such part of said system which is able to generate random letter symbols selected from the symbols represented at figure 6A of the attached drawings. The letter game further involves setting specific scoring points by means of one of the score setting pushing buttons 14,15 and 16 which is at the same time displayed on the display panels 28 and 29. A specific instruction or question in connection with the random letter symbol that is to be generated and displayed on the display panel is then disclosed to the players, for instance by means of an instruction card not represented , set upright in the slit 32 of the device, and the actual game is started by pushing the start11 button 17 which brings into action the letter symbol generation function of the microprocessor system. During the symbol scanning by said mircroprocessor system, a dynamic symbol representation, as defined hereabove is displayed on the display panels 28 and 29 and dynamic sound sequences are produced through the sound source. The symbol scanning is stopped by pushing the cen trawl panel stop button 18, which automatically displays a random letter symbol on the display panels 28 and 29. The remote control panels 2 may then be operated to claim the preset scoring points for answering the instruction or question raised in connection with the displayed letter symbol, which automatically sets the game system in a situ ation in which said preset scoring points are assigned to the remote control that has been operated, and may be added to or substracted from the scoring points total assigned to that remote control. Depending whether the scoring points are added to the scoring total, which means that the considered player won the game turn, or are substracted from the scoring total, which means that the considered player lost the game turn, the game system is automatically reset at the initial situation or at a point where the game goes on with the remaining players. 5. hen for instance selecting the dice game of the examplified device, one uses the symbol generation function of the microprocessor system, more particularly such part of said system which is able to generate random.s nbol combination, consisting of dice representations selected from the symbol combinations represented at figure 6 B.of the attached drawings. Selecting the dice game further also automatically involves the use of such part of the microprocessor system which monitors a sequential enabling of the remote control panels 2, whereby the sequence numeral assigned to an enabled remote control panel can be displayed on the display panels 28 and 29. Upon enabling one remote control panel 2 the game device automatically starts the dice representation generation function of the microprocessor system, whereby during this dice representation scanning a dynamic symbol representation, as already defined, is displayed on the display panels 28 and 29 and dynamic sound sequences are produced through the sound source. The dice representation scanning is stopped by pushing the push button 33 of the enabled remote control panel 2 which automatically displays a random dice representation on the display panels 28 and 29. The electronic game device may then directly switch to enable the following remote control panel 2 of the sequence, or the electronic game device may first enable the same remote control panel 2 to have another dice representation, or other dice representations, displayed, before having a predetermined scoring quotation for the displayed subsequent dice representations, monitored through an internal score quotation memory, displayed on the display panels 28 and 29. The electronic game device may thereby also have a decimal summation of the subsequent dice symbols displayed on the display panels 28 and 29 and then switch to enabling the next remote control panel, or the device may have quotaions assigned to the displayed dice representation combinations or sequences, and have said quotations stored in a scoring memory, whereby such stored quotations may be totalized to the individual scoring total assigned to each remote control panel 2, according to predetermined rules also stored in said scoring memory, before the device switches to enable the next remote control panel 2. I.Men for instance selecting the symbol combination game of the examplified device, one uses the symbol generation function of the microprocessor system, more particularly such part of said system hichis able to generate random symbol combinations selected from combietions of blancs and horizontal and vertical stripes determining the digital display means. Selecting the symbol combination game further also automatically involves the use of that part of the microprocessor system which monitors the sequential enabling of the remote control panels 2 as set forth hereabove in connection with the dice game. Upon enabling one remote control panel the game device automatically starts the random symbol generation function of the microprocessor system, whereby during this random symbol scanning a dynamic symbol representation, as defined hereabove, is displayed on the display parers28 and 29 and dynamic sound sequences are produced through the sound source. The random symbol scanning is stopped by pushing the push stop button 33 of the enabled remote control panel 2 which automatically displays a random symbol combination on the display panels. This displayed random symbol combination is then automatically assigned with 2 predetermined scoring quotation, through the internal score quotation memory of the device, which score is displayed on the display panels 28 and 29, and totalized into the individual scoring total assigned to the enabled control panel 2. This scoring total is also displayed on the display panels 28 and 29, whereafter the game device switches to enable the next remote control panel 2 of the sequence. It must be clear that the invention is by no means limited to the features described here above in connection with one specific example of a preferred embodiment of an electronic game device in accordance with said invention and that many different embodiments of the invention are possible.
