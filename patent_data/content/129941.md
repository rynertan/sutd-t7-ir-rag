## Description
Title A table The invention relates to a table comprising two or more legs, at least one leg being fitted with a height adjustment mechanism.Such tables are generally known, e.g. tables for a slide projector, a drawing table and the like. It is an object of the invention to construct a table so that it is both horizontally adjustable and conveniently adjustable in height. To this effect, a table of the above described type is characterized in that all legs are fitted with adjustment mechanisms that are adjustable both in separate and in interconnected relationship.Said leg adjustment mechanisms may consist of connectable worm wheel transmissions which can be driven both manually and by means e.g. of an electric motor. To facilitate the adjustment, the worms may be interconnected by a detachable connecting rod fitted with a telescopically resilient portion. As a result, the legs can first be adjusted each separately, so that the table at least the top is in horizontal position and or all legs are bearing and subsequently the connecting rod is mounted, after which the table in the horizontal position can be displaced in vertical direction. When the legs are interspaced so that when the table is loaded, deflection thereof is feared, it is possible to dispose around the coupling elemert or the connecting rod a tube connected at each end pivotally to the respective leg. As a result, an additional support for the table top is provided and, moreover, the connecting rod is covered. When use is made of a table comprising a central portion and at least one wing linking up therewith, of an optional shape or size, the connection between the wing and the central portion can extend according to a curved line of separation and the portions can be interconnected by a tie member. By using a curved line of separation, a considerably greater stability is obtained than in case a straight line of separation is used. Adjacent said line of separation, the central portion and the wing may each be provided with a groove, in which grooves there is provided a connecting strip. By using reversible wings, these can be arranged both at the left and at the right of the central portion. In order to ensure a good stability of the legs separately, each leg may consist of at least two telescopically coacting portions. One embodiment of the table according to the invention wil now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a perspective view, with partly exploded parts, of a leg adjustment mechanism Fig. 2 is a top view of the worm worm wheel transmission use in the apparatus shown in Fig. 1 Fig. 3 is a top view of a table top Fig. 4 is a cross section on the line IV IV of Fig. 3 and Fig. 5 is a cross section on the line V V of Fig. 3. As shown in the drawings, a leg adjustment mechanism comprises an attachment plate 1 to which a depending jacket 2 is attached in a manner not shown, and a casing 3 for a worm worm wheel transmission. The latter is further diagrammatically shown in Fig. 2 a worm 4 is fitted towards both ends with a worm stub shaft 5, to which a universal joint portion 6 is attached. A worm wheel 7 secured against rotation is mounted on a threaded shaft 8. This threaded shaft is received in a nut 9, which is affixed to the top of a support 10 fitted with a foot 11. As shown in Fig. 1, the jacket 2 is fitted with a slot 12, receiving a pin 13 affixed to the support 10. The edge of the slot may be fitted with a dimensioning, not further shown. It will be clear that by rotation of the worm 4, the height of the attachment plate can be adjusted selectively. The universal joint portion 6 connects to a corresponding universal joint portion 14, the free end of which is fitted with a cross sectionally square pin 15. Said pin 15 is slidingly received in a corresponding recess of a connecting rod 16. Between the universal joint portion 15 and the connecting rod 16, there is provided a compression spring 17. The top view of a table top shown in Fig. 3 diagrammatically shows a central portion 18 and wings 19 linking up therewith by means of a curved line of separation 30. Instead of the wings 19, use can also be made of the wing 34 shown at the right in Fig. 3. Naturally, also wings of different formats or sections, or a plurality of wings one behind the other are possible. Underneath each wing, there is represented a leg adjustment mechanism 1 10 with a foot 11. As shown in the drawings, the leg adjustment mechanisms are interconnected by means of the worm stub shafts 5, the universal joint portions 6, 14 and the connecting rods 15. The central axes of the worm shafts and the connecting rods may be at an angle relative to each other different from 1800. The leg adjustment mechanism mounted underneath the wing 34 is fitted at the projecting free universal joint portion 6 with a detachable or non detachable crank 23 adapted to adjust the coupled leg adjustment mechanisms. In order to prevent,,especially with larger top formats, a deflection thereof, it is possible, as shown in dotted lines inFig. 1, to provide a cross sectionally rectangular tube 35 having lugs 36, the central axis of which extends through the pivot point of the universal joint 6,14. The lugs 36 are rotatably connected, by elements not shown to the attachment plate 1, and a support 37 attached to the jacket 2, respectively. The cross section shown in Fig. 4 shows the attachment of the attachment plate 1 to the wing 19. As shown in the Figure, the wing 19 is fitted with a bore 20 having edge holes 21. In said bore and one of the edge holes, there is received an internally threaded bush 22.A screw 23 extending through an opening in the attachment plate 1 is adapted to coact with the bush. The cross section shown in Fig. 5 finally shows the attachment of the central portion 18 to the wing 19. In the wing 19 there is provided a hole, not further shown, wherein there is arranged both an internally and an externally threaded bush 24. The bush 24 coacts with a screwed spindle 25, the projecting end of which extends through a recess 26 in the central portion 18. The screwed spindle 25 extends through the recess 26 into a recess 27 and is fitted at that location with a washer 28 and a nut 29. By tightening the nut 29, the wing is firmly pulled against the central portion 18. As further shown in Fig. 5, both the central portion 18 and the wing 19, at the line of separation 30, is fitted with a recess 31, 32, wherein a connecting strip 33 is received. The table according to the invention is particularly suitable among other things for placing thereon a computer liked terminal, while the terminal itself can be arranged on the central portion and auxiliary appliances, if any, and forms, respectively, can be disposed on the wing s . It will be clear that a great many variants are possible without departing from the scope of the invention, depending on the tasks to be performed on the table an the requirements to be set thereto.
