# MEMORY SYSTEM AND ORGANIZATION FOR HOST COMPUTER

## Abstract
A host computer 10 is backed up by magnetic disk stores 14 which may be of different types having different track lengths. The host computer is conventionally coupled to the disk stores by channels 12 , a storage director 16 and disk control modules 18 . A solid state cache memory array 22 with an associated cache manager 22 are connected to the storage director for storing tracks of data likely to be required by the host computer. In order to provide efficient utilisation of the cache memory array 22 it is arranged in domains having a length which is substantially an integral multiple of all the different track lengths, The domains are assigned to the different classes of disk storage devices 14 and reallocation is effected from time to time on the basis of actual usage.
