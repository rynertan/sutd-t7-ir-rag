# Apparatus for displacing a length of track.

## Abstract
Apparatus for displacing a length of articulated track for use in disassembling assembling or reassembling the track. A guide table 1 for guiding movement of the track 30 is adapted to tilt in an upward direction only together with a pair of rails 6 located beneath the table 1 which are raised or lowered by actuating a first cylinder 17 . A trolley 8 moves forwards and backwards on the rails 6 by actuating a second cylinder 12 . The trolley 8 has an engagement rod 10 which extends upwards through a slot 3 in the guide table 1 to come in engagement with a bushing 31 in the track 30 . Forward displacement of the track 30 is achieved by tilting up the guide table 1 together with the rails 6 by actuating the first cylinder 17 displacing the trolley 8 forwards by a distance equal to one pitch of the track 30 by actuating the second cylinder 12 lowering the rails 6 to the lowermost position by retracting the first cylinder 17 and displacing the trolley 8 backwards to the initial position by retracting the second cylinder 12 . The distance of displacement is adjusted by positioning two stops on a stationary screw spindle 14 extending below the rails 6 . An abutment member 11 fixed beneath the trolley abuts the stops 15 and 16 .
