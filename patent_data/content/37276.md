## Description
Dt SCRIYTION PROCESS FOR PRODUCING METHANOL OR A CARBOXYLATE DERIVATIVE THEREOF AND THE PRODUCT OF SUCH PROCESS This Invention relates to a catalytic process for producing methanol directly from synthesis gas.More particularly, the invention concerns reacting synthesis gas, i.e., mixtures of hydrogen and carbon monoxide in the presence of a stable ruthenium carbonyl complex catalyst to directly form methanol. Hethanol is an increasingly important feedstock for the production of carbon based chemicals. Existing or proposed commercial processes using methanol include dehydrogenation to form formaldehyde, carbonylation to form acetic acid, homologation to form ethanol and reactions over zeolitic materials to form gasoline grade fractions. Owing to the reduced availability of petroleum, the cost of producing chemicals from petroleum has been steadily increasing and the anticipated increase in commercial methanol manufacture has underscored the need for a different, low cost source which can be converted into chemicals. Synthesis gas, which is derived by the combustion of any carbonaceous material including coal, or any organic material, such as hydrocarbons, carbohydrates and the like has for a long time been considered a desirable starting material for the manufacture of a variety of chemicals. Hydrocarbons have been made by the Fischer Tropsch catalytic reaction.Methanol is commercially manufactured by a heterogeneous catalytic reaction from synthesis gas. Aidehydes and alcohols are made from the reaction of olefines and synthesis gas. One of the deficiencies of known processes for making chemical products from synthesis gas involves the use of heterogeneous catalysts or, when using a homogeneous catalytic reaction1 employing a rhodium carbonyl complex catalyst which is extemely expensive.Rhodium is employed in automotive catalytic converters which comprise the combustion devices for reducing automotive pollutant emissions. The high cost of rhodium is created by its limited availability and the tremendous demand for it. Thus, a commercial process which uses rhodium as a catalyst is affected by the high capital expense to purchase the metal and the strict controls needed to limit catalyst losses in order to keep the economics of the process competitive. Ruthenium, on the other hand, is a precious metal which has no significant commercial application. Its present cost is approximately 1 20th, and less, that of rhodium even though its concentration in the ore from which both are obtained is about the same. Ruthenium has been explored as a catalyst by many. It has been considered as a hydrogenation catalyst, as a hydroformylation catalyst, as a catalyst to produce a wide range of monohydric alcohols tnon specific as to any of them exclusive of methanol, as an alcohol homologation catalyst such as for the conversion of methanol to ethanol, and as a t See Cornils, et al., Hydrocarbon Processing, June, 1975, pp. 83 to 91.

For example, in a recent report Journal of theAmerican Chemical Society, vol. 101, pp. 7419 21 1979 J. S. Bradley of Exxon Corporation produced methanol and methyl formate at a selectivity greater than 997. without hydrocarbon products detected, by the reaction of synthesis gas H2 CO 2 1 under pressures on the order of 1,300 atmospheres and at temperatures around 270 C. using a Ru catalyst, which under the conditions of the reaction was present as Ru CO 5.Bradley reported that no honologation products were found. In Williamson, et al., United States Patent 4,170,605, patented October 9, 1979, the patentees report in Examples I and II the reaction in l propanol of synthesis gas CO H2 t 1 1 at 25,000 psig and at 230 C. using ruthenium tris acetylacetonate and 2 hydroxypyridine for a period of 2 and 3 hours, respectively. In Example I, Williamson, et al.report the production of 4 grams of product containing mole percent basis ethylene glycol, 57 and methanol, 25. In Example II, 7 grams of product are reported containing 66 and 16 mole percent of ethylene glycol and methanol, respectively. Further, in copending application Serial Number 091,242, filed November 15, 1979, and in european PatentApplication No. 79105298.8 there is described a process for selectively producing methanol, ethanol, and ethylene glycol by reacting carbon monoxide and hydrogen in a homogeneous liquid phase mixture containing a ruthenium carbonyl complex.The reaction is effected at a temperature between about 50 C. to about 400 C. and a pressure of between about 500 psia 35.15 kg cm2 and about 15,000 psia 1,054,6 kg cm2 for a period ot time sufficient to produce such products and in copending application Serial Number 971,50, filed December 21, 1978, there is described an improved process for producing methyl and ethylene glycol esters as described in Serial Number 091,242 and European Patent Application No. 79105298.8 in which the improvement comprises maintaining the combined concentration of methyl ester, ethylene glycol ester and water in the reaction medium at less than about 30 vol. . Included in the 4 and 7 grams of product are trace amounts of water and methylformate, as well as 16 mole Example I and 15 mole t. Example II of propylformate. The latter compound would appear to be derived form 1 propanol initially present in the reaction mixture, rather than a synthesis gas derived product. Thus, while previously crown processes using homo geneous ruthenium catalysts will produce methanol with high selectivity, generally very high pressures are required or other products are also produced and it would be desirable to produce only methanol or derivatives thereof at high process efficiency and low or moderate pressures. In accordance with the present invention there is provided a process for making methanol, or derivative precursors such as acylates, directly from the reaction of hydrogen and carbon monoxide. The process comprises a establishing and maintaining a solvent containing liquid phase comprising solubilized ruthenium carbonyl complex in which the solvent has a dielectric constant of at least 2, determined at 250C. or at its melting point, whichever is higher b supplying hydrogen and carbon monoxide in said liquid phase c providing a promoter of said reaction in said liquid phase and d maintaining said liquid phase for a sufficient period of time at a temperature and pressure which causes said hydrogen and carbon monoxide to react to produce methanol, said temperature is between about 50 C. and said pressure is between about 500 psia 35.15 kg cm2 and 15,000 psia 1,054,6 kg cm2 . The catalyst of this invention is that catalyst which is formed during the course of the reaction. The process of this invention involves the conversion of synthesis gas, however derived, into large amounts of methanol which can be directly consumed or which can be employed as starting materials to make other valuable chemicals. The process of this invention is capable of producing methanol in high concentrations with substantially no other alcohol or undesirable by products being prepared. Moreover, the process of this invention provides the capability of a low cost route to methanol. This process constitutes a relatively low pressure process for converting.synthesis gas to methanol. The process of this invention is carried out with the ruthenium carbonyl complex dissolved in a solvent, even though such complex may exist during the reaction in more than one liquid phase. In this sense, the reaction is termed a homogeneous liquid phase reaction. There may be more than one such phase existing in the reaction zone but the ruthenium carbonyl complex existing as the catalyst is always dissolved in at least one of such phases and is always in a dissolved liquid state.The problem with heterogeneous ruthenum catalysis in the reaction zone is that such will induce the Fischer Tropsch reaction resulting in the formation of hydrocarbons and or a variety of oxygenated hydrocarbons having a variety of molecular weights with low selectivity to any one compound. In fact the presence of such products suggests that undissolved ruthenium is present. The process of this invention involves the reaction of soluble ruthenium complexes in the presence of a promoter preferably a Lewis acid promoter, with synthesis gas at temperatures, pressures ana for a period of time sufficient to produce methanol. Such conditions are set forth herein. The reaction conditions comprise i a period of time at a temperature and pressure which cause the hydrogen and carbon monoxide to react to produce the desired product, ii a temperature between about 50 0C and 400 C. and iii a pressure between 500 psia 3515 kg cm2 and 15,000 psia 1,054.6 kg cm2 . The catalyst of this invention is the ruthenium containing carbonyl complex which under the prescribed reaction conditicns catalyzes the aforementioned reaction between carbon monoxide and hydrogen. The process of this invention is distinctive in the selection of materials which comprise the homogeneous liquid phase mixture, the reaction parameters and the stability of the ruthenium containing catalyst in most cases, indeed, in all cases studied.As with any technology, this process has undergone evolutionary changes and its further examination will undoubtedly bring about more changes, most likely In the form of additional or substitutional steps and or materials. In accordance with the invention the process is carried out in the presence of a promoter. A promoter, in the context of this invention, is a material provided to the reaction which provides a promotional effect in that it enhances the production viz., rate, yield or efficiency of methanol or it helps to reduce the loss of ruthenium during the reaction. The promoter is preferably a Lewis acid containing compound. Any Lewis acid may be a promoter but all Lewis acids will not serve to act as a promoter under any given set of reaction conditions. The effectiveness of the Lewis acid as a promoter will in large measure be dependent upon the reaction conditions selected.Operation of the process in the absence of the Lewis acid promoter will result in less productivity and therefore, explotation of the process in a commercial sense will necessitate the use of the promoter. The amount of Lewis acid promoter added to the process is that amount which provides the promotional effect. The maximum amount employed is that amount whose presence is too costly for the economical operation of the process, or substantially reduces the promotional effect without any advantage, or provides no advantage in the operation of the process, or a combination of these factors. The promoter can be a material used in miniscule quantities to a material employed in maximum quantities such as a solvent for the reaction and the ruthenium carbonyl complex catalyst.The promoter can also be a material which when present reacts with the products of the reaction. Apart from the conditions of the reaction in terms of time, temperature and pressure, the selection of solvent and Lewis acid promoter constitute important considerations in the most advantageous practice of this invention. The selections of solvent and promoter are not narrowly limited yet there appears to be some degree of cooperation that each imparts to the success of the process and the selection of one oftentime dicatates the selection of the other in order to maximize the benefits of the invention. It is found necessary that there be used a solvent that is capable of maintaining the chosen ruthenium carbonyl complex and the Lewis acid promoter if it is not the solvent , in the homogeneous liquid phase mixture throughout the reaction. This appears to be the prime function of the solvent. The solvent may possibly provide an additional benefit such as influencing the kinds of ion pairing that exist during the course of the reaction. The catalyst of this invention is a ruthenium compound which contssins carbon monoxide directly bonded to ruthenium ruthenium carbonyl . The ruthenium compound which is provided to the reaction is not necessarily in a form which will effectively catalyze the reaction even if it contains a carbon monoxide ligand bonded to it. Ruthenium compounds such as ruthenium salts, oxides and carbonyl clusters may be introduced to the reaction in a condition which allows them to be solubilized, and under the conditions of the reaction they are converted into a carbonyl complex which effectively catalyzes the reaction. That is why they are defined in terms of products made by the process. The composition and structure of the ruthenium carbonyl complex which catalyzes the desired reaction is not specifically known. Factors in achieving the catalyst are the reaction parameters, the choice of solvent, and theLewis acid promoter that one employs. Because varied reaction conditions, solvents, and promoters, result in different amounts of the desired product of the process, and different rates, efficiencies and or yields, it is presumed that each provides a different and distinct catalytic environment. The ruthenium containing substance which may be employed in the practice of this invention to form the catalyst under process conditions encompass those which are described, for example, in Gresham, U.S. Patent No.2,535,060 at column 2, starting at line 38 to line 48, and ruthenium carbonyl compounds. It is not advisable to place ruthenium compounds or substances on a support material for use in the process of this invention because such offers no benefits over solubilizing such ruthenium compounds in combination with the aforementioned solvent and Lewis acid promoter.Moreover, ruthenium deposited on a support material can be expected to be solubilized in the homogeneous liquid phase reaction system of this invention as it is ccntacted with carbon monoxide. Even ruthenium metal in the presence of the solvent, carbon monoxide and hydrogen can be converted to a ruthenium carbonyl complex which is soluble. Ruthenium oxides, such as dioxide, sesquioxide, or tetraoxide, are capable under appropriate conditions of being solubilized and converted to a carbonyl complex which can be used to form the catalyst under the conditions of this process.However, when using such insoluble ruthenium compounds, they ust first be solubilized before the effective operation of the process of this invent ion. Ruthenium carbonyl compounds which include ruthenium carbonyl hydrides or ruthenium carbonyl clusters are already provided with a carbonyl ligand, and under the conditions of the reaction can be sufficiently changed to achieve the desired catalytic effect. Ruthenium salts such as those of organic acids can be employed in the practice of this invention to produce the catalyst.In addition to those ruthenium compounds described in the aforementioned Cresham patent, one aay employ ruthenium compounds of bidentate ligands, allyl complexes, arene complexes, halides, and alkyl complexes. The choice of ruthenium compounds is varied and not critical to this invention. number of ruthenium complexes are known to be more stable to the presence of carbon monoxide than other ruthenium compounds and the skilled worker can determine which particular ruthenium compound might take longer to initiate a reaction than other ruthenium compounds.On that basis, one can select for the purposes of convenience the particular ruthenium compound to be utilized in forming the catalyst. However, ruthenium which is associated with an organic molecule or complexed with carbon monoxide is most readily solubilized so as to provide the ruthenium catalyst of this process. As characterized above, this process is operated as a homogeneous liquid phase mixture. The process is typically carried out in a solvent for the catalyst and the Lewis acid promoter. Thus the solvent is a quid in which the catalyst presumed to be a ruthenium carbonyl complex and the added Lewis acid promoter are soluble under the prescribed conditions of the reaction. The solvent may be solid at room temperature but should at least in part be a liquid wonder the conditions of reaction. IllustratIve of suitable solvents are, e.g.,Water, alcohols, ketones, esters including lactones, amides including lactates, sulfones, sulfoxides, halogenated hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons, and the like. Illustrative of specific solvents encompassed by the above classes of polar solvents are, for example. aromatic hydrocarbons, e.g., benzene, toluene, xylene, naphthalene, alkylnaphthalene, etc. carboxylic acids such as acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, caproic acid, stearic acid, benzoic acid, cyclohexanecarboxylic acid, etc., see the description of acyl compounds in S.N. 971,667 and European Patent Application No.79105298.8 alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, n butanol, etc. ketones such as acetone, methylethyl ketone, cyclohexanone, cyclopentanone, etc. esters such as methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, propyl acetate, butyl acetate. methyl propionate, ethyl butyrate, methyl laurate, etc. anhydrides such as phthalic anhydride, acetic anhydride, etc. lactams such as N alkyl caprolactam, such as N methylcaprolactam, Nalkyl pyrrolidinones such as N methyl pyrrolidinone cyclic ureas such as N,N dimethylimidazolidone polyols such as ethylene glycol, glycerine, erythritol, polyalkylene glycol containing two to about ten thousand repeating units lactones such as gamma butyrolactone halogenated hydrocarbons such as chlorobenzene, chloroform, methylene chloride, 2,2 dichloropropane amides such as dimethyltormamide, dimethylacetamide, hexamethylphosphoramide sulfones such as sulfolane, dimethylsulfone, the substituted sulfolanes described inU.S. Application Serial iso. 61,456, filed July 27, 1979 and G.B. Patent ITo. 1537850 slfoxidcs Such as direthyl sulfoxide, diphcnyl sulfoxide as ell as many other. Other suitable solvents are the ethers, cryptands, and the like. Illustrative of specific solvents encompassed by the above classes of solvents are, for example, ethers such as tetrahydrofuran, tetrahydropyran, diethyl ether, l,2 dimethoxybenzene, l,2 diethoxybenzene, the mono and dialkyl ethers of alkylene and polyalkylene glycols, such as ethylene glycol, of 1,2 propylene glycol, of 1,2 butylene glycol, of diethylene glycol, of di 12,2 prc,ylene glycol, of triethylene glycol, of pentaethylene glycol such as triglyme, tetraglyme and pentaglyme , of di 1,2 butylene glycol, of oxyethylene oxypropylene glycols, etc., preferably those in which the alkylene group contains 2 and or 3 carbon atcms in the divalent moiety, such as ethylene and 1,2 propylene the cryptands such as described in U.S.Patent No. 4,111,975, which description of cryptands, as prompters in that case, are incorporated herein by reference the crown ethers or Crown Ethers, as one may prefer such as described in U.S. Patent No. 4,162,261, which description of crown ethers, as solvents in that case, are incorporated herein by reference as well as many others. The choice of solvent in any particular case can be a complex decision. Some solvents such as the carboxylic acids e.g., acyl compounds described in U. S. PatentApplication S.N. 71,fi 7 and European Patent Application o. 7Q10529s.8 play a dual role in the practice of the process of this invention. They can provide the required Lewis acid promoter as well as the solvent.In many instances, solvents react with the products of the reaction and such reactive solvents are considered useful in the practice of this invention because the derivative products obtained are an excellent source for the desired products of the reaction. For example, the carboxylic acids are not only effective solvents and promoters, they are also reactive with the methanol product, to produce methyl carboxylate which can be readily hydrolyzed to produce the alcohol product The Lewis acids suitable as promoters in the practice of this process are not a narrowly defined class of materials. They encompass a broad range of inorganic and organic materials, and all members of the class are contemplated as employable in the practice of this invention.Its cffectiveness in some instances can be noted when used in as little an amount which is the least amount that a measurable promotional effect is seen to an amount wherein the Lewis acid is also a solvent for the reaction The Lewis acid can serve a dual function by playing the role as the solvent for the reaction. There is no simple way of deterrninng whatLewis acid will function effectively under a given set reaction conditions. In the typical case, when aLewis acid exhibits promotional affects on the rate of the reaction, it is present and dissolved in the liquid phase in a range of from about .01 mole to about 106 moles for each atom gram atomic weight of ruthenium present in the reaction.More preferred, the Lewis acrid is present even when the solvent used is a Lewis acid in the liquid phase in a range from about 1 mole to about 104 moles for each atom of ruthenium present in the reaction most preferably, greater than one mole up to about 1000 moles of the Lewis acid for each atom of ruthenium present and dissolved in the liquid phase. The Lewis acid promoters include inorganic as well as organic compounds, which as defined by G. N. Lewis, 3. Franklin Inst., Vol.226, p. 293 1936 are compounds which are capable of acting as electron pair acceptors. Suitable Lewis acid promoters for the process of this invention include salts containing alkali netal cations, such as NaPF6, KBF4, and CsCl salts containing alkaline earth metal cations, such as MgC12 and CaI salts of zinc, cadmium, and mercury, such as ZnCl2 and HgI2 compounds of boron, such as B OH 3, B OCH3 3, and BF3 compounds of aluminum and gallium, such as A1 OH 3, A1 OCX2CH3 3, GaCl3. and Ga OH 3 oxo acids, such as H3PO4 and CH3CO2H and binary acids such as HF and HC1, as well as many others. Not all of the above Lewis acids, or for that matter all Lewis acids, will necessarily function effectively in all of the cn.bodinents of the process, of this invention. In most cases a degree of selection between the choice of Lewis acid, the amount of ruthenium, the choice of solvent and the reaction parameters will be required to obtain the level of productivity sought. Because R2 is supplied to the reaction, a hydride of ruthenium can exist in the reaction system but there is no appreciation of the particular role that the hydride is playing in the reaction, The relative amounts of carbon monoxide and hydrogen which are initially present in the reaction mixture can be varied over a wide range. In general, the molar ratio of CO H2 is in the range of from about 40 1 to about 40, suitably from about 10 1 to about 1 10. It is to be understood, however, that molar ratios outside the broadest of these ranges may be employed.Substances or reaction mixtures which gie rise to the formation of carbon monoxide and hydrogen under the reaction conditions may be employed instead of mixtures comprising carbon monoxide and hydrogen which are used in preferred embodiments in the practice of the invention. Mixtures of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and hydrogen can also be employed. If desired, the reaction mixture can comprise steam and carbon monoxide. The quantity of catalyst employed is not narrowly critical and can vary over a wide range. In general, the process Is desirably conducted in the presence of a catalytically effective quantity of the active ruthenium species which gives a suitable and reasonable reaction rate. Reaction can proceed when employing as little as about 1 x ic 6 weight percent, and even lesser amounts, of ruthenium based on the total weight of reaction mixture i.e., the liquid phase mixture . The upper concentration limit can be quite high, e.g., about 30 weight percent ruthenium, and higher, and the realistic upper limit in practicing the invention appears to be dictated and controlled more by economics in view of the cost of ruthenium.Since the rate of conversion of synthesis gas may be dependent upon the concentration of ruthenium employed, higher concentrations achieving higher rates1 then large concentrations may prove to be a most desirable embodiment of this invention. Depending on various factors such as the Lewis acid promoter, the partial pressures of carbon monoxide and hydrogen, the total operative pressure of the system, the operative temperature, the choice of solvent, and other considerations, a catalyst concentration of from about 1 x 10 3 to about 20 weight percent ruthenium contained in the complex catalyst based on the total weight of reaction mixture, is generally desirable in the practice of the invention. The temperature which may be employed in practicing the process may vary over a wide range of elevated temperatures. In general, the process can be conducted at a temperature between about 50it. and about 400 C. and higher. Temperatures outside this stated range, though not excluded from the scope of the invention, do not fall within certain desirable embodiments of the invention. At the lower end of the temperature range, the rate of reaction to desired product becomes markedly slow. At the upper temperature range, and beyond, catalyst, solvent, or Lewis acid promoter instability may occur. Nothwithstanding these factors, reaction will continue and the methanol and or its derivatives will be produced. Preferred temperatures. are between about 1000C. and about 3500C., and most desirably, between about 1500C. and about 300 C. The process is suitably effected over a wide superatmospheric pressure range. At pressures in the direction of and below about 500 psia 35.15 kg cm , the rate of desired product formation is quite slots, and consequently, relatively faster reaction rates and o higher conversions to the desired products can be obtained by employing higher pressures,e.g., pressures of at least about 1,000 psia 70.31 kg cm2 .Pressures as high as 20,000 to 50,000 psia 3,515.35 2 kg cm , and higher, can be employed but there is no apparent advantage in using such pressures, and any advantage that could be reasonably contemplated would be easily offset by the very unattractive plant investnent outlay required for such high pressure equipment and the costs associated with such high pressure operations.Therefore, the upper pressure limitation is approximately 15,000 psia 1,054.6 kg cm2 . Effecting the process below about 15,000 psia 1,054.6 kg cmê , especially below about 10,000 psla 703.1 kg cm2 , results in significant cost advantages which are associated with lower pressure equipment requirement and operating costs. A suitable pressure range is from about 500 psia 35.15 kg cm2 to about 12,500 psia 878.84 kg cm2 . The pressures referred to above represent the total pressure of hydrogen and carbon monoxide. The process is effected for a period of time sufficient to produce the methanol product and or derivatives thereof. In general, the residence time to produce the desired product can vary from minutes to a number of hours, e.g., from a few minutes to 4 hours, and longer. It is readily appreciated that the residence period time will be influenced to a significant extent by the reaction temperature, the concentration and choice of Lewis acid promoter and ruthenium source, the total gas pressure and the partial pressure exerted by its components, the concentration and choice of solvent, and other factors. The synthesis of the desired product by the reaction of hydrogen with carbon monoxide is suitably conducted under operative conditions which give reasonable reaction rates and or conversions. The, process can be executed in a batch, semi continuous, or continuous fashion. The reaction can be conducted in a single reaction zone or a plurality of reaction zones, in series or in parallel, or it may be conducted intermittently or continuously in an elongated tubular zone or series of such zones. The material of constructionshould be such that it is inert during the reaction and the fabrication of the equipment should be able to withstand the reaction temperature and pressure. The reaction zone can be fitted with internal and or external heat exchanger s to thus control undue temperature fluctuations, or to prevent any possible run away reaction temperatures due to the exothermic nature of the reaction.In preferred embodiments of the invention, agitation means to vary the degree of mixing of the reaction mixture can be suitably employed.Mixing induced by vibration, shaker, stirrer, rotate , oscillation, ultrason c, etc., are all illustrative of the types of agitation means which are contemplated.Such means are available and well known to the art. The catalyst precursor may be initially introduced into the reaction zone batchwise, or it may be continuously or intermittently introduced into such zone during the course of the synthesis reaction. Means to introduce and or adjust the reactants, either intermittently or continuously, into the reaction zone during the course of the reaction ean be conveniently utilized in the process especially to maintain the desired molar ratios of and the partial pressures exerted by the reactants. As intimated previously, the operative conditions can be adjusted to optimize the conversion of the desired product and or the cconomics of the process. In a continuous process, for instance, when it is preferred to operate at relatively low conversion, it is generally desirable to recirculate unreacted synthesis gas with without make up carbon monoxide and hydrogen to the reactor. Recovery of the desired product can be achieved by methods well known in the art such as by distillation, fractionation, extraction, and the like.A fraction comprising ruthenium complex, generally contained in byproducts and or the solvent, can be recycled to the reaction zone, if desired. All or a portion of such fraction can be removed for recovery of the ruthenium values or regeneration thereof, if necessary. Fresh ruthenium precursor, Lewis acid promoter and or solvent, can be intermittently added to the recycle stream or directly to the reaction zone, if needed. Many embodiments of the ruthenium carbonyl complex,Lewis acid promoter, and solvent combinations encompassed by this invention are sufficiently stable to allow repeated use of the ruthenium carbonyl complex.For example, the process of this invention can be continuous y operated in a pressure reactor into which is continuously fed synthesis gas. The velocity of the synthesis gas is sufficient to strip products of the reaction out of the reactor leaving behind in the reactor the ruthenium carbonyl complex, Lewis acid and solvent combination. The products are separated from the unreacted synthesis gas and the synthesis gas is recycled to the reactor. The products, in this embodiment, are recovered free of ruthenium, Lewis acid and solvent. In this embodiment, the catalyst need not be removed from the reactor to a recovery zone for separating product. Thus a catalyst treatment step is avoided. The examples below depict batch reactions however, the above continuous gas recycle process can be operated in a similar manner.That is, the batch reactor simulates the continuous reactor except for the gas sparging and continous gas recycle. Although this invention has been described with respect to a number if details, it is not intended that this invention should be limited thereby. Moreover, the examples which follow are intended solely to illustrate a variety of, including tile cost favorable, embodiments of this invention and are not intended in any way to limit the scope and the intent of this invention EXAMPLES In examples 1 9, recorded in Table I below, the following procedure was employed A 500 ml stainless steel bomb reactor containing a removable glass liner was charged with a mixture of 0.50g Ru3 CO 12 2.35 mmoles Ru , solvent andLewis acid as designated below. Carbon monoxide and hydrogen were then added in equimolar amounts to the reactor to attain a pressure therein of 3,000 psig 211.95 kg cm2 at 250C. Thn reactor was rocked and the contents heated to the reaction temperature and maintained at this temperature for two hours except when noted otherwise while rocking the reactor. The reacto was then cooled and vented. The contents of the reactor were removed and analyzed by gas chromatography. No ethylene glycol or ethanol ere detected hy these analyses.

EXAMPLE10 A 500 ml stainless steel bomb reactor containing a removable glass liner was charged with a mixture of l.Og. Ru3 CO 12 4.69 roles Ru in 50 ml. of ethyl acetate. Equimolar amounts of carbon monoxide and hydrogen were then added to the reactor to attain a pressure therein of 2,600 psig 182.8 kg cm2 at 250C. The reactor was rocked and the contents heated to 2500C. and maintained at this temperature for four hours rocking the reactor. The reactor was then cooled and vented. The contents of the reactor were removed and analyzed by gas chromatography. This analysis showed that the following products were produced 2.30 grams of methanol and 3.33 grams of methyl acetate.
