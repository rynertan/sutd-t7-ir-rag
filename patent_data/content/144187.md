## Description
Compositions which have a positive temperature coefficient of resistance PTC compositions are known. They can be composed of ceramic material, eg. a doped barium titanate, or a conductive polymer material eg. a dispersion of carbon black or other particulate conductive filler in a crystalline polymer. The term PTC is generally used and is so used in this specification to denote a composition whose resistivity preferably increases by a factor of at least 2.5 over a temperature range of 14 C or by a factor of at least 10 over a temperature range of 100 C, and preferably both. The term switching temperature or T There are serious limitations in the known techniques for making electrical devices which contain PTC and or ZTC elements composed of ceramic or conductive polymer materials. Ceramic materials are brittle and are difficult to shape, particularly when large or complex shapes are needed. Conductive polymers can be manufactured in a wider variety of shapes, but especially with PTC materials, close control is needed to ensure adequate uniformity it is yet more difficult, if not impossible, to produce a predetermined variation in properties in different parts of an article. In addition, the physical strength of laminar conductive polymer devices is often less than is desirable. When a heat shrinkable PTC conductive polymer article is required, there is the difficulty that when a PTC conductive polymer sheet is rendered heat shrinkable by stretching the cross linked sheet above its melting point and then cooling it in the stretched state , the PTC of the heat shrinkable sheet is often substantially smaller than that of the original sheet this limits the stretch ratio that can be employed and, therefore, the available recovery. We have now discovered that improved PTC devices can be prepared by incorporating at least one of the electrodes into a fabric. Thus in one aspect the invention provides a fabric which is suitable for use as an electrical heater and which comprises an ordered array of interlaced elongate elements, characterized in that said fabric comprises 1 a first elongate electrode which forms at least part of a first of said interlaced elongate elements 2 a second elongate electrode which forms at least part of a second of said interlaced elongate elements, said second element not being said first element and 3 a PTC element which is in the form of a layer surrounding at least one of said electrodes and which is composed of a conductive polymer, and through the thickness of which current passes when a source of electrical power is connected between the first and second electrodes and which is composed of a conductive polymer, and through which current passes when the first and second electrodes are connected to a source of electrical power. Particularly useful devices can therefore be prepared by making use of an elongate element which comprises an elongate electrode and a resistive element which electrically surrounds the electrode this elongate element is converted into a fabric which can be incorporated into an electrical system or device. A wide range of such elongate elements can be easily produced in a uniform manner, and through the use of known fabric manufacturing techniques, such as weaving, knitting and braiding, they can be converted into fabrics which are completely uniform or which vary in a desired predictable way. Other elongate elements can be included in the fabric to provide or enhance desired properties such as strength or heat recoverability or other thermally induced response. In a preferred embodiment, the invention provides an electrical device which comprises Particularly useful devices are those which comprise an element, preferably a non conductive element, which is thermally responsive and which is heated when current is passed through the device. Such devices can be recoverable, either as a result of passing current through the device or as a result of some other action. For example, very useful heat shrinkable articles comprise a woven fabric comprising spaced apart first and second elongate electrodes running in one direction, and heat shrinkable non conductive elongate elements running in the other direction, the fabric being impregnated or coated with a heat softenable ZTC conductive polymer. When the article is powered, the heat generated by Joule heating causes the ZTC material to soften and the non conductive elements to shrink, thus shrinking the fabric in the direction of the non conductive elements and drawing the electrodes closer together. The invention also includes processes in which a recoverable fabric of the invention as described above, especially one containing non conductive heat shrinkable filaments in the fabric, is used to cover a substate, the process comprising In another embodiment, the PTC element is a substantially continuous laminar element which is composed of a conductive polymer. The invention is illustrated in the accompanying drawing, in which the Figures are diagrammatic, partial, cross sectional views of devices of the invention in particular, The invention will chiefly be described herein by reference to the preferred devices of the invention, in which there are two or more electrodes, at least one of the electrodes being an elongate electrode forming part of an elongate element which i comprises the electrode and a PTC conductive polymer element electrically surrounding the electrode and ii forms part of the fabric. However, the invention includes similar devices in which some other type of PTC element electrically surrounds the electrode provided of course that it permits conversion of the element into the fabric . In addition, the invention includes fabrics comprising at least one elongate element which comprises a an elongate metal element and b a conductive polymer element which substantially surrounds the elongate metal element and which may be ZTC or NTC element, for example such a fabric which further comprises another electrode which is electrically separated from the first electrode not only by the ZTC or NTC element but also by a PTC element, preferably a conductive polymer PTC element. It should be understood, therefore, that the following detailed description also applies, mutatis mutandis, to such other embodiments of the invention. In the preferred devices of the invention, at least one of the electrodes is an elongate electrode, usually of metal, e.g. copper or nickel coated copper, for example a solid or stranded wire, which is electrically surrounded by a PTC conductive polymer element. Usually the PTC element will be melt shaped, preferably melt extruded, preferably so that it physically surrounds the electrode as a uniform coating throughout its length. However, other methods of forming the PTC element, e.g. dip coating, and other geometric arrangements, are possible. For example the PTC element can vary in thickness and or resistivity radially and or longitudinally. Alternatively, the PTC element can alternate radially and or longitudinally with polymeric elements which are electrically insulating or which have a resistance which is much higher than the resistance of the PTC element at room temperature, so that at least when the device is at relatively low temperatures, substantially all the current between the electrodes passes through the PTC element it is to be noted that the broad definition of the devices of the invention does not exclude the possibility that at temperatures close to and above the T The other electrode in the preferred devices is preferably another elongate electrode which forms part of the same fabric as the first elongate element as is usually preferred or part of a different fabric. The second electrode can be the same as or different from the first electrode. Electrical contact between the first and second electrodes can be achieved in any suitable way. For example, the second electrode can be in contact with the first PTC element or it can be electrically surrounded by a second PTC element which has the same T The third electrical element, when present as is preferred , preferably comprises a ZTC conductive polymer. It can be of uniform composition or can comprise discrete sub elements for example it may be desirable to coat an electrode or a PTC element surrounding an electrode with a first ZTC conductive polymer in order to provide improved electrical and physical contact to a second ZTC conductive polymer. The third electrical element can fill or bridge the interstices of the fabric s , thus providing a continuous laminar element. Alternatively, the third electrical element can be coated onto the fabric s so that apertures remain in the fabric. In another embodiment, part or all of the third electrical element is provided by an elongate element which is interlaced with at least one other elongate element to form part of the fabric s , with the remainder if any of the third element being coated on or otherwise united to the fabric to provide desired electrical contact between the elongate elements. The third electrical element can be thermally responsive, e.g. heat shrinkable. The dimensions of the third electrical element and the resistivity and other properties of the ZTC conductive polymers preferably used for it should be correlated with the other elements of the device, but those skilled in the art will have no difficulty, having regard to their own knowledge e.g. in the documents referenced herein and the disclosure herein, in selecting suitable ZTC elements. When the device is recoverable, the ZTC element preferably has low viscosity at the recovery temperature so that it impedes recovery as little as possible. Suitable polymers for the ZTC material include copolymers of ethylene with one or more polar copolymers, e.g. ethyl acrylate and vinyl acetate. The first elongate element and the other elongate elements can be formed into a fabric by any method which results in an ordered array of interlaced elongate elements. Weaving is the preferred method, but knitting, braiding etc. can be used in suitable cases. The density of the weave or other form of interlacing can be selected in order to provide the desired power output or shrinkability when the fabric incorporates shrinkable elements as described below or other property. Similarly, the density of the weave can be varied from one area to another to provide a desired variation, eg. of at least 10 or at least 25 , in one or more properties from one discrete area which may be, for example, at least 5 or at least 15 of the total area to another. Triaxial weaving can be employed. In order to pass current through the device, the electrodes must of course be connected to a power source, which may be DC or AC, e.g. relatively low voltage, e.g. 12, 24 or 48 volts. The various components of the device must be selected with a view to the power source to be employed. When the electrodes are elongate electrodes, they may be powered from one end or from a number of points along their lengths the former is easier to provide, but the latter results in more uniform power generation. The device may include, at least in selected areas thereof, a non conductive element which provides desired properties, particularly a non conductive element which is thermally responsive and which is heated when current is passed between the electrodes, or a non conductive element, e.g. of glass fibers, which provides stiffness or other desired physical properties. The non conductive element can be, for example, a heat recoverable, e.g. heat shrinkable, element. Such heat recoverable elements can for example be composed of an organic polymer which can be cross linked or a memory metal alloy. Other useful thermally responsive members include a layer of a hot melt adhesive or a mastic a thermochromic paint or a component which foams when heated. The non conductive element can be an elongate element which forms part of the fabric s incorporating the elongate electrode s , e.g. a continuous monofilament or multifilament yarn or a staple fiber yarn. Suitable heat shrinkable elements can be composed of, for example, a polyolefin, e.g. high, medium or low density polyethylene a fluoropolymer, e.g. polyvinylidene fluoride a polyester, e.g. polyethylene terephthalate or poly butylene terephthalate or a polyamide, e.g. Nylon 6, Nylon 6,6, Nylon 6, 12, Nylon 11 or Nylon 12. The element is preferably capable of unrestrained recovery to less than 50 , preferably less than 35 , especially less than 25 of its stretched dimension. An especially preferred embodiment of the invention is a heat shrinkable device which is useful, for example, for protecting joints between elongate substrates such as telephone cables, and which comprises The first and second elements generally run in one direction in the fabric which may be the warp or the weft, depending on the ease of weaving , with the heat shrinkable element running at right angles thereto. This enables the first and second elements to accommodate to shrinkage of the heat shrinkable element by moving closer together, without longitudinal shrinkage. The first and second elements can be powered from one end, in which case they will normally have a serpentine shape. Alternatively the fabric can be woven so that the electrode is or can be exposed at regular intervals along the fabric, eg. each time it changes direction, thus permitting the exposed ends to be bussed together by some bussing means which permits the desired shrinkage to take place. Generally, the exposed ends of the first electrodes will be joined together along one edge of the fabric and the exposed ends of the second electrode will be joined together along the opposite edge of the fabric. In these devices, it is important that the heat generated in the conductive polymer elements is sufficient to raise the heat shrinkable elements to their shrinkage temperature. In order to ensure that there is adequate heating of the ZTC element before the PTC element shuts off, it is preferred that the resistance of the ZTC element is greater than, preferably at least 1.2 times, the resistance of the PTC element s at all temperatures between 0 C and T In these devices, it is preferred that the PTC conductive polymer composition has a first resistivity ρ₁ and comprises a first polymeric component which contains at least 50 by volume of a crystalline polymer having a first melting point T₁, the ZTC conductive polymer composition comprises a polymeric component which contains at least 50 by volume of a thermoplastic polymer having a softening point T₂ and a resistivity ρ₂ wherein It is also preferred that T₁ T₂ is at least 30 C, particularly at least 50 C, and that T₁ T The thermal properties of the device and of the surroundings are important in determining the behavior of the device. Thus the device can comprise, or be used in conjunction with, a thermal element which helps to spread heat uniformly over the device, eg. a metal foil layer, or which reduces the rate at which heat is removed from the device, eg. a layer of thermal insulation such as a foamed polymer layer. Referring now to the drawing, Figure 1 is a partial cross sectional side view of a device of the invention, showing electrodes 1 of one polarity, each surrounded by a PTC conductive polymer element 11, and parallel electrodes 2 of opposite polarity, each surrounded by a PTC conductive polymer element 21. The electrodes are woven into a fabric with heat shrinkable non conductive filaments 4 at right angles to the electrodes, and the fabric is impregnated or coated with ZTC conductive polymer element 3. Figure 2 is a partial cross sectional side view of the device of Figure 1 after it has been powered to cause shrinkage of the filaments 4 and softening of the ZTC element 3. Figure 3 is a partial cross sectional plan view of a device as shown in Figure 1. The electrodes 1 are connected at one end to a bus bar connector 12 which runs along one edge of the fabric and does not prevent shrinkage of the filaments 4 when they are heated. Similarly the electrodes 2 are connected at one end to a bus bar connector 22 which runs along the opposite edge of the fabric and does not prevent shrinkage of the filaments 4 when they are heated. The ZTC element 3 completely fills the interstices of the fabric. Figure 4 is similar to Figure 1 and shows the same elements 1, 2, 3, 4, 11 and 21, and in addition shows elongate elements 6 which are woven into the fabric parallel to the PTC elements and are composed of a hot melt adhesive 15 which melts at the shrinkage temperature of the filaments 4. Also shown in Figure 4 is an electrically insulating polymeric backing 7 which softens at the shrinkage temperature of the filaments 4. Figure 5 is a partial cross sectional plan view of another device of the invention which is similar to that shown in Figures 1 and 3, but in which the electrodes follow a serpentine path and are powered from one end, and the ZTC element 4 coats the fabric but does not fill its interstices, leaving a plurality of voids 41. Figure 6 is a partial cross sectional side view of another device of the invention which is similar to that shown in Figures 1 and 2 except that the electrodes 1 are woven into one fabric with half of the heat shrinkable filaments 4, while the electrodes 2 are woven into a second fabric with the other half of the heat shrinkable filaments 4. The fabrics are secured to each other by the ZTC conductive polymer element. Figure 7 is a partial cross sectional side view of another device of the invention which is very similar to that shown in Figure 1 but in which there is no PTC coating around the electrodes 2. Figure 8 is a partial cross sectional side view of another device of the invention which comprises electrodes 1 and 2 embedded in a PTC element 11 to form a self limiting strip heater preferably having an outer insulating jacket not shown . The strip heater is woven into a fabric with heat shrinkable filaments 4.

RK 167, 176, 177, 178, 179, 181 and 205, and MPO790 filed by Raychem Limited on January 6, 1983 and August 16, 1983 and Application No. 8,305,639 filed by N.V. Raychem S.A. on March 1, 1983, Case No. BO89. The disclosures of these applications is incorporated herein by reference. The invention is illustrated by the following Example. A satin weave fabric was prepared using the following elongate elements The weft of the fabric was composed of elements 1 and 2 , there being three elements 2 between each of the elements 1 , and the elements 1 being 0.3 inch 0.76 cm apart center to center . The warp of the fabric was composed of elements 3 at a frequency of 72 filaments per inch. The fabric was then irradiated to a dosage of 12 17 Mrad, thus cross linking PTC conductive polymer and the polyethylene. The irradiated fabric was laminated under heat and pressure to a 0.03 inch 0.076 cm thick sheet of a conductive polymer composition which had a resistivity of about 80 ohm.cm at 25 C and about 200 ohm.cm at 140 C i.e. it was ZTC compared to the PTC composition of element 1 , and which comprised carbon black dispersed in a very low crystallinity ethylene ethyl acrylate copolymer. At the same time, the opposite face of the fabric was laminated to a 0.011 inch 0.028 thick layer of an insulating polymeric composition. The resulting product had a cross section similar to that shown in Figure 4. The electrodes followed a serpentine pattern similar to that shown in Figure 5. When the electrodes were connected to a 36 volt DC power source, the fabric heated to a temperature of about 130 C, at which temperature the polyethylene filaments had reached their shrinkage temperature, and the hot melt adhesive filaments and ZTC layer had softened the fabric therefore shrank in the transverse direction to about 33 of the original transverse dimension.
