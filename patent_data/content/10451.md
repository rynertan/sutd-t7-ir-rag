## Description
DESCRIPTION PROCESS FOR THE DELIGNIFICATION OF LIGNOCELLULOSIC MATERIAL AND PRODUCTS THEREOF . This invention relates to a process for the delignification of lignocellulosic material such as wood, straw, bagasse, etc. and in particular relates to an improved vapour phase alkaline pulping process for the production of a chemical cellulosic pulp. The processing of lignocellulosic material to produce cellulose suitable for the manufacture of paper products involves the removal of lignin and other noncellulosic components such as gums. Reagents that attack lignin without appreciably affecting the cellulose component are preferred for this purpose. It is still a general practice today to use these reagents in the form of aqueous solutions and to effect the cooking of lignocellulosic material in such solutions under conditions of temperature and pressure chosen to provide an acceptable lignin to cellulose ratio.Depending upon the nature of the reagents used, this licuid phase process is known as the soda process wherein the reagent is sodium hydroxide alone, the kraft process wherein the reagents are sodium hydroxide and sodium sulphide, the polysulphide process wherein the reagents are sodium hydroxide, sodium sulphide and polysulphides, or the neutral sulphite semichemical process in which the reagents are an alkali metal base such as sodium hydroxide and an alkali metal sulphite such as sodium sulphite. All these reagents have in common that they give alkaline aqueous solutions and thus constitute alkaline cooking liquors. In attempts to improve on the above liquid phase process, certain modifications have been proposed. One such modification, known as the vapour phase process, consists in impregnating lignocellulosic material in a suitably divided form with an alkaline cooking liquor, withdrawing any excess of cooking liquor and then cooking the impregnated material under the same time and temperature conditions as in conventional liquid phase pulping. An example of this process wherein kraft liquor is used as the impregnating liquor is described by Kleinert in United States PatentNo. 3,215,588 issued on 2nd November, 1965. As compared with the liquid phase process, the vapour phase process affords an increased pulping rate and lower chemical requirements. Another recently proposed modification is described in British application No, 5374 77 filed on 9thFebruary, 1977 United States Patent No. 4,012,280, issued on 15th March, 1977 as well as in United States applicationSerial No. 750,441, filed on 14th December, 1976, and UnitedStates Patent Nos. 4,036,680 and 4,036,681, issued on 19thJuly, 1977.In these applications, it is taught to effect the cooking of lignocellulosic material in a liquid phase process with an alkaline pulping liquor, there being present in said liquor from 0.001 to 10.0 by weight based on the lignocellulosic material of a cyclic keto compound selected from the group consisting of naphthoquinone, anthraquinone, anthrone, phenanthrenequinone, the alkyl, alkoxy and amino derivatives of these compounds, 6,l1 dioxo 1H anthral,2 c pyrazole, anthraquinone 1,2 naphthacridone, 7,12 dioxo 7,12 dihydroanthrarl,2 g pyrazine, 1, 2 benzanthraquinone, 10methylene anthrone and the unsubstituted and lower alkyl substituted Diels Alder adducts of naphthoquinone and benzoquinone.As compared with the conventional liquid phase process, this modification which consists in the addition to the cooking liquor of any one of the above cyclic keto compounds results in a increased rate of cooking as well as in a better pulp yield. One great advantage of this modification when applied to the soda process is that it makes the latter as efficient as the conventional kraft process in the pulping of soft wood. It has now been found that there are advantages to be gained by using the above cyclic keto compounds as additives in the vapour phase process. It is thus proposed according to the present invention to delignify lignocellulosic material by impregnating the lignocellulosic material in subdivided form with an alkaline pulping liquor containing a suitable amount of a cyclic keto compound as hereinabove defined, withdrawing any excess of liquor and finally heating to a temperature and for a time sufficient to obtain the desired degree of pulping In producing pulps of equivalent residual lignin levels under equivalent cooking schedules time temperature profile , this novel vapour phase process, as compared with the above mentioned liquid phase process utilizing cyclic keto compounds, results in higher pulp yields while at the same time requiring lesser amount of caustic and cyclic keto compounds and retaining the advantages of the conventional vapour phase process. The process of the present invention comparises the steps of 1. impregnating lignocellulosic material in subdivided form with an alkaline pulping liquor containing from 0.001 to 10.0 by weight, based on the lignocellulosic material, of a cyclic keto compound selected from the group consisting of naphthoquinone, anthraquinone, anthrone, phenanthrenequinone, the alkyl, alkoxy and amino derivatives of these com ourds, 6, ll dioxo lH anthra anthra pleX yrazole, anthraquinone 1,2 naphthacridone, 7,12 dioxo 7,12 dihydroanthra 1,2 b pyrazine, 1,2 benzanthraquinone, 10 methylene anthrone and the unsubstituted and lower alkyl substitutedDiels Alder adducts of naphthoquinone and benzoquinone, 2. removing any excess of liquor from the impregnated material, and 3. cooking said impregnated material by heating to a temperature in the range of 1500C to 2000C for a period of 0.5 to 480 minutes. The cooked lignocellulosic material produced by the above third step is then washed as in the conventional processes with water or an aqueous liquor inert to the lignocellulosic material to obtain a delignified cellulosic material which may be used without further treatment or may be subjected to conventional bleaching steps. When the lignocellulosic material employed is wood, it is first converted into the form of chips. Of course, this step is not required when the lignocellulosic material is of fibrous form. The process of this invention can be used to delignify either coniferous or deciduous species of wood.By coniferous is meant species such as pine, spruce and balsam fir. By deciduous is meant species such as birch, aspen, eastern cottonwood, maple, beech and oak. When treating a high density deciduous wood such as birch, it is preferable to employ a longer time to reach maximum cooking temperature in the third step. Pulping liquors suitable for use in the first step of the process are the soda, kraft, polysulphide and alkaline sulphite liquors. However, the soda liquor is much preferred because it does not contain any sulphur compounds and is therefore considerably less polluting than the three other liquors. The soda liquor contains from 8 to 20 by weight of alkali metal base expressed as percent effective alkali, based on the weight of the lignocellulosic material, and normally also contains alkali metal carbonate The kraft liquor contains from 8 to 15 by weight of alkali metal base expressed as percent effective alkali TAPPI T 1203 S 6 and from 5 to 40 by weight of alkali metal sulphide expressed as percent sulphidity TAPPIT 1203 05 61 , based on lignocellulosic material. This pulping liquor will normally contain alkali metal sulphate and alkali metal carbonate. The polysulphide liquor is essentially a kraft liquor as defined immediately above, containing excess sulphur, i.e.polysulphides, The presence of polysulphides results in an improved yield and an amount of 1.0 to 5.0 , preferably 2 thereof expressed as sulphur and based on weight of lignocellulosic material in the liquor is therefore a definite advantage. The alkaline sulphite liquor is a liquor which contains an alkali metal hydroxide preferably sodium hydroxide and an alkali metal sulphite preferably sodium sulphite. Effective alkali is the sum of all alkali hydroxide in solution expressed as Na20 including that formed by hydrolysis of the alkali sulphide, also expressed as Na2O, Sulphidity is the total sulphide, expressed as Na2O, calculated as a percentage of total titrable alkali, including that formed by hydrolysis. As mentioned above, the compounds which are suitable for use as additives,in the process of the invention are the cyclic keto compounds selected from the group consistings of naphthoquinone, anthraquinone, anthrone, phenanthrenequinone, the alkyl, alkoxy and amino derivatives of these compounds, 6, ll dioxo 1H anthra 1,2 c pyrazole, anthraquinone 1,2 naphthacridone, 7 , 12 dioxo 7, 12 dihydro anthra 1,2 b pyrazine. 1,2 benzanthrazuinone, 10 methylene anthrone, 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 octahydroanthraquinone and the unsubstituted and lower alkyl substituted Diels Alder adducts of naphthoquinone and benzoquinone.By alkyl derivatives of these compounds, it is meant to include any of the four compounds naphthooulnone, anthraquinone, anthrone and phenanthrenequinone, substituted with one or two alkyl groups containing 1 to 4, preferably 1 to 2, carbon atoms. Among the alkoxy derivatives of the same four compounds which are suitable for use as additives, are those which have at least one alkoxy substituent containing 1 to 4, preferably one, carbon atoms Among these alkyl, alkoxy and amino derivatives, those of anthraquinone are preferred and examples thereof are l methyl anthraquinone, 2 methyl anthraquinone, 2 ethyl anthraquinone, 2,6 dimethyl anthraquinone, 2,7dimethyl anthraquinone, 2,3 dimethylanthracuinone, l methoxy anthraquinone and 2 amino anthraquinone. The unsubstituted Diels Alder adducts suitable for use as additives in the process of this invention are those obtained by reacting 1 or 2 moles of butadiene with naphthoquinone and benzoquinone respectively. By lower alkyl substituted adducts it is meant the adducts obtained where in the above reaction either one or both cf the reactants are substituted with the appropriate lower alkylGroups. Such lower alkyl groups may range in number from 1 to 4, may each contain from 1 to 4 carbon atoms and may be the same or different.Examples of Diels Alder adducts are 1,4,4a,5,8,8a,9a,10a octahydroanthraquinone, 2,3,6,7 tetraniethyl 1,4,4a,5,8, Ba, 9a, l0a octahydroanthraquinone, 1,4,4a,9a tetrahydroanthraquinone, 2 ethyl 1,4,4a,9a tetrahydroanthraquinone, 2,3 dimethyl 1,4,4a,9a tetrahydroanthra quinone and 1, 3 dimethyl l, 4, 4a, 9a tetrahydroanthraquinone. The cyclic keto compound as above defined is added to the pulping liquor prior to impregnation of the lignocellulosic material and is employed in proportions of from 0.001 to 10.0 , preferably 0.01 to 1.0 by weight based on the lignocellulosic material. Where the alkaline pulping liquor is the soda liquor, it has been found advantageous to use as a second additive in combination with any of the above cyclic keto compounds1 a nitro aromatic compound selected from the group consisting of mono and dinitrobenzenes and the amino, carboxy, hydroxy, and methyl derivatives thereof. Examples of these compounds are nitrobenzene, 2 nitroaniline, 4 nitroaniline, 4 nitrobenzaldehyde, 4 nitrobenzoic acid, 2 nitroresorcinol, 4 nitrostyrene, 2 nitrotoluene, 4 nitrotoluene, 1,2 dinitrobenzene, 1,3 dinitrobenzene, 1,4 dinitrobenzene, 2,4 dinitrotoluene, 3,5 dinitrobenzoic acid, 4,6 dinitro o cresol and 2,4 dinitroresorcinol. Among the above compounds, nitrobenzene is particularly preferred because of its favourable cost benefit ratio.The nitro aromatic compound is employed in proportions of from 0.01 to 10.0 6, preferably 0.10 to 2.0 , by weight, based on the lignocellulosic material It should be well understood that the use of nitro aromatic compound as second additives in combination with cyclic keto compounds is optional and only applicable to the case where the pulping liquor is soda liquor.All combinations formed from any one of the above defined cyclic keto compounds with any one of the above defined nitro aromatic compounds are suitable for use in this particular embodiment of the invention Preferred, however, is the combination comprised of anthraquinone and nitrobenzene The alkali metal base employed as reagent in the alkaline pulping liquors may be sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate or potassium carbonate The process of the invention is carried out in a closed vessel to which lignocellulosic material in subdivided form, pulping liquor containing the above defined additive or additives, and, if necessary, dilution water are fed in the amounts required to give the desired effective alkali. Impregnation is effected under gas or mechanical pressure and at a temperature of 250C or higher. Once full impregnation has taken place, excess pulping liquor, if any, is drained off and the impregnated lignocellulosic material is heated either directly with steam or indirectly by e.g. electrical heating to a temperature of 1500C to 200 C for a period of 0,5 to 480 minutes. The material resulting from step 3 of the process may be bleached by any conventional bleaching process. A conventional sequence comprising chlorination, alkaline extraction, chlorine dioxide treatment, alkaline extraction, chlorine dioxide treatment C E D E D will provide a product having a brightness of approximately 85 90 units Elrepho .

In each run, two samples of the chips were treated, one by vapour phase cooking and the other by conventional liquid phase cooking. The results obtained are shown in Table III. As will be seen in said Table, no additive was used in run 1 whereas there was used as an additive, anthraquinpne AQ in runs 2, 3 and 4 2 methyl anthraquinone 2 MeAQ in runs 5 and 6 and 1,4,4a,9a anthroquinone THAQ in runs 7 and 8. Impregnation of the chips for the vapour phase cooking was effected as follows In run 1, the chips were impregnated as perExample 2. In runs 2, 3 and 4,. the chips were impregnated as per Example 1. In runs 5 and 6, the chips were impregnated essentially as per Example 2 except that the microdigestor contents were preheated at 800C for 1 hour before impregnation at 800 C This modification was necessary to allow the 2MeAQ to be reduced and pass into solution to achieve a superior penetration. In runs 7 and 8, impregnation was effected as follows a The chips were charged to the microdigestor, the latter closed and the contents subjected to 10 cycles of 75 psig nitrogen pressure for 1 minute followed by 20 mm Hg vacuum for 1 minute to remove air from the wood.b THAQ was added to dilution water in a flask, purged of air with nitrogen followed by the addition to the additive of part of the oxygen free caustic soda charge for the cook. c The above was heated at 950C under nitrogen until the THAQ passed completely into solution, forming an orange red solution. This was cooled under nitrogen and finally the flask was sealed under nitrogen by means of stop cocks.d The microdigestor, dissolved additive and remaining pulping chemicals were placed in a nitrogen filled glove box followed by the assembly of the cook under nitrogen.e The treatment described in Example 2 c was then carried out on the contents of the microdigestor. The excess liquor, not absorbed by the chips, was poured off and collected for analysis as in Example 2. All other operations were carried out in the manner described in Example 1. For liquid phase cooks, the additives and chemicals were charged to the chips in the microdigestor followed by closure and cooking. Liquid phase cooks were carried out with the effective alkali and additive levels shown in Table III under the heading Impregnated Liquor .

The results obtained are shown in Table IV. As will be seen in said table, no additive was used in run 1 whereas in run 2, the additive anthraquinone was used. Impregnation of the chips for the vapour phase cooking was effected by the same technique as used for runs 5 and 6 of Example 3, except that the one hour preheating operation to form the polysulphide solution and the subsequent impregnation were carried out at 50 C instead of 80 C. All other operations were carried out in the manner described in Example 1.

In each run, two samples of the chips were treated one by vapour phase cooking and the other, for comparison purposes, by conventional liquid phase cooking.The results obtained are showin in Table V. As will be seen in said table, no additive was used in run 1 whereas in the other runs a cyclic keto compound was used as an additive. Impregnation of the chips for the vapour phase pulping was effected by the same technique as used for runs 5 and 6 of Example 3.
