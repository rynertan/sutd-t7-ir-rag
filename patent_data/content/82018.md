# Absorption refrigeration system.

## Abstract
An absorption refrigeration system having a generator, a rectifier, a condenser, an evaporator, an absorber and heat exchangers which are connected by means of conduits in an airtight manner so that circulations for refrigerant and for absorbent solution ore formed, wherein the rectifier is mounted upright above the generator, and wherein a receiver for receiving absorbent containing refrigerant is mounted below the rectifier and communicates with the lower portion of the generator through an absorbent passage means, whereby decreasing hindrance of the generation of the refrigerant vapor from the generator, thus increasing the efficiency in generating vapor and, at the same time, preventing local overheating of the solution in the generator.
