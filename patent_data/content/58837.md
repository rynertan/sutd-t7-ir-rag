# Process for producing austenitic stainless steels less susceptible to rolling defects.

## Abstract
A process for producing austenitic stainless steels, is described, which process prevents the occurrence of rolling defects, particularly slivers. Specifically, a process for controlling casting conditions on the basis fo nitrogen contents in the molten steel and further controlling hot working conditions including working temperature and heating conditions.
