# Process for measuring lamina size distribution.

## Abstract
A process for measuring the lamina size distribution comprises the steps of uniformely spreading sampled lami nae over a conveyor and transporting the same image forming the conveyed lamina at a detection region having a given area by using a television camera each time when the lamina moves by a length corresponding to that of the detection region storing in a memory binary video data which are converted from the video signal obtained by the image forming processing the stored video data to encircle continuous ones of the binary data which correspond to the lamina with a rectangular frame counting the number of continuous ones of the binary data converting the con tinuous ones of the binary data in the frame into the other ones binary data after counting successively carrying out the same processing of different continuous ones of binary data to calculate the size of respective laminae and measur ing the distribution of the lamina size upon the basis of the calculation results.
