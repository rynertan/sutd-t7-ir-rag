## Description
The present invention relates to a signal converter used in a tuning device for a radio receiver, a television receiver and the like. An article of G.J. Hurst with the title YIG and what it means to microwave instruments published in Marconi Instrumentation, Vol. 15, No. 4, p. 76 79 describes a signal converter having the following features It is an object of the present invention to provide a signal converter using the ferromagnetic resonance effect, said converter having a simple construction and essentially not suffering from the effects of spurious modes. The signal converter of the present invention comprises the above listed features of the prior art converter and is characterized in that According to an advantageous embodiment, the signal converter does not comprise only a filter and a local oscillator, but it additionally comprises a second local oscillator and a second mixer in the input stage of the filter. Therefore, the filter does not receive the original input signal but it receives a signal mixed of said input signal and the signal from the second local oscillator. Such an arrangement is principally described in US A 3,939,429 which, however, does not use thin film ferrimagnetic crystals. US A 4,152,676 describes an electromagnetic signal processor for e. g. filtering and or delaying electromagnetic waves. The signal processor uses a bulk single crystal sample in which a non uniform field is generated to provide confinement and guiding of wave modes. Preferably, mechanical deformation is employed to generate the required field profils to provide a track or tracks for the waves. In an embodiment, a circular groove of rectangular cross dimension is cut into the magnetic crystal as a mechanical deformation. Waves propagate along the groove from an input electrode, traversing the groove, to an output electrode, traversing the groove at another location separated from the location of the input electrode. Thus, the signal processor as disclosed in US A 4,152,676 has so to speak opposite function than the signal converter of the present invention, as in the prior art signal processor, a groove is established in the bulk crystal in a way to guide waves, whereas in the signal converter of the present invention, a groove is provided in a thin film crystal in a way to block waves. A signal converter as an embodiment of the invention will now be described referring to Fig. 1. The embodiment is of superhetorodyne type, and comprises an antenna 1, a high frequency filter circuit 2 using ferromagnetic resonator such as YIG resonator, a high frequency amplifier 3, a mixer 4, a local oscillator 5 including a resonator using ferromagnetic resonator such as YIG resonator, and magnetic field applying means 6 and 7 which supply magnetic fields variably to YIG resonator elements in the filter circuit 2 and the local oscillator 5 respectively. Both means 6 and 7 may be adjusted in interlocking. Resonance frequency of the YIG element in the filter circuit 2 is adjusted by the means 6, thereby selection of pass band center frequency in the filter circuit 2, that is, selection of tuning frequency or tuning action is effected. In this case, signal received from the antenna 1 is introduced to the YIG filter circuit 2, and signal of frequency f In the invention, special constitution is adopted in the YIG filter circuit 2 and the YIG resonator of the local oscillator 5. The magnetic resonance element is formed on a common paramagnetic substrate such as GGG gadolinium gallium garnet substrate by means of thin film forming method, such as sputtering, chemical vapor deposition CVD or liquid phase epitaxy LPE , into a ferrimagnetic thin film, e.g. YIG thin film. The YIG thin film is patterned by photolithography thereby both YIG thin film magnetic resonance elements are simultaneously formed on the common GGG substrate. In this case YIG thin film elements to constitute the YIG filter circuit 2 and the YIG resonator of the local oscillator 5 respectively have the same shape, such as disk, square or rectangular shape. Difference of resonance frequencies, that is, offset frequency can be set by selecting aspect ratio of each YIG thin film element, for example, ratio of film thickness to diameter in the case of disk shape. If both YIG thin film elements are formed by the same film, in the case of disk shape, offset frequency is set by selecting different diameters of both elements. For example, if saturated magnetization 4πM Both resonance elements of YIG thin film are provided by the same thin film element in the above embodiment. When the YIG thin film is formed on the substrate by means of thin film forming method such as CVD, LPE or sputtering, the film thickness can be obtained uniformly and precisely. Consequently, even when both YIG thin film resonance elements are formed on separate substrates by the same or different process, the resonance frequency can be set accurately without dispersion in comparison to the case where YIG monocrystalline substance such as YIG sphere or YIG monocrystalline plate is machined by cutting or polishing so as to obtain YIG magnetic resonance element. An example of independent constitution of a filter circuit 2 and a local oscillator 5 will be described. Fig. 2 shows a plan view of an example of structure of the filter circuit 2, and Fig. 3 shows a sectional view thereof. In this example, a first major surface of a dielectric substrate 21 of alumina or the like has a ground conductor 22 adhered thereon, and a second major surface has first and second micro strip lines in parallel to each other, i.e. input and output transmission lines 23 and 24 adhered thereon. Ends of both strip lines 23 and 24 are connected to the ground conductor 22 through first and second connecting conductors 25 and 26 respectively. First and second YIG thin film magnetic resonance elements 27 and 28 are disposed on the second major surface of the substrate 21 in electromagnetic coupling with the first and second micro strip lines 23 and 24 respectively. The first and second magnetic resonance elements 27 and 28 are constituted in a process that YIG thin film is formed on a major surface of GGG substrate 29 by the thin film forming method and then patterned in disk shape by using photolithography technique including selective etching. A third micro strip line, i.e. coupling transmission line 30 is formed between the first and second magnetic resonance elements 27 and 28 on the substrate 29 so as to couple these element electromagnetically and adhered to other surface of the substrate 29. Both ends of the third strip line 30 are connected to the ground conductor 22 through connecting conductors 31 and 32 respectively. Distance between both elements 27 and 28 is selected to λ 4 wherein λ is wave length of the center frequency in the pass band so that insertion loss in the cutoff region outside the pass band is sharply increased. On the other hand, Fig. 4 shows an example of structure of the local oscillator 5, and Fig. 5 shows a sectional view taken on line A A of Fig. 4. A first major surface of a dielectric substrate 51 of alumina or the like has a ground conductor 52 adhered thereon, and a second major surface has a micro strip line 53 adhered thereon. One end of the micro strip line 53 is connected to the ground conductor 52 through a connecting conductor 54. YIG thin film magnetic resonance element 55 is electromagnetically coupled to the micro strip line 53. The YIG thin film magnetic resonance element 55 is in a process that YIG thin film is formed on a major surface of GGG substrate 56 by the thin film forming method and then patterned in disk shape by photolithography. Numeral 57 designates a high frequency bipolar transistor, numeral 58 an impedance converter, and numeral 59 a MOS capacitor for blocking D.C. component. In this example, base B of the transistor 57 is connected through a wire 61 to a ground pad 60 in turn connected to the ground conductor 52, emitter E is connected to side of the element 55, and collector C is connected to side of the impedance converter 58, thereby series feedback type oscillator utilizing common base transister is constituted. Next, oscillation principle and condition for the oscillation will be described in connection with the circuit using the magnetic resonance element as a resonator. The resonator, i.e. YIG magnetic resonance element 55 is inserted to feedback circuit other than output circuit. Fig. 6a and Fig. 6b are block diagrams of the oscillating circuit. Numeral 62 designates YIG resonance circuit, numeral 63 a negative resistance circuit, numeral 64 an impedance matching circuit, and numeral 65 a load. Numeral 66 in Fig. 6 b designates a load impedance including the impedance matching circuit. In Fig. 6, reflection coefficient Γ wherein Z Condition of steady oscillation is expressed by following formula using Γ hence The negative feedback circuit in Fig. 6 may be a two terminal active element of negative resistance or a circuit composed of three terminal active element and feedback element. The example described in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 uses high frequency bipolar transistor. Fig. 7 shows constitution of a series feedback type oscillating circuit utilizing common base transistor, and X designates a reactive circuit. Above description of the oscillating circuit relates to steady oscillation. In order that the oscillation rises, however, following condition must be satisfied. Wherein Γ Based on above conditions, operation principle of the YIG oscillating circuit will be described referring to Smith chart in Fig. 8. At small signal state, value 1 Γ In constitution of Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, if the YIG element 55 is not in resonance, the YIG oscillating circuit becomes only strip line with front end shortcircuited and therefore Γ If the YIG element 55 resonates at frequency f₀ between f₁ and f₂ by application of d.c. magnetic field, Based on such principle, if d.c. applied magnetic field is varied and resonance frequency of the YIG element is varied between f₁ and f₂, the oscillating circuit oscillates in tuning to frequency near the resonance frequency. In an example of Figs. 2 and 3 and an example of Figs. 4 and 5, the filter circuit 2 and the local oscillator 5 are formed on the separate substrates 21 and 51. However, the signal converter as a whole may be formed integrally on a single substrate. An example of such constitution is shown in Fig. 9 and Fig. 10. Fig. 9 is a plan view of a signal converter, and Fig. 10 is a sectional view taken on line A A of Fig. 9. Parts in Fig. 9 and Fig. 10 corresponding to Fig. 1 through Fig. 5 are designated by the same reference numerals, and the repeated description shall be omitted. In this case, the above mentioned substrates 21 and 51 are replaced by a common substrate 91 made of alumina for example. One major surface of the common substrate 91 has a filter circuit 2, an amplifier 3, a mixer 4 and a local oscillator 5 formed thereon, and other major surface has a common ground conductor 92 adhered thereon in place of the ground conductors 22 and 52. The GGG substrates 29 and 56 are replaced by a common GGG substrate 93, and YIG thin film elements 27, 28 and 55 are formed on the substrate 93. In a notch 94 provided on the substrate 91, ends of micro strip lines 23, 24 and 53 are connected to the ground conductor 92 through connecting conductors 25, 32 and 54 respectively. The GGG substrate may be provided with recesses corresponding to shape and size of various YIG thin film elements, and the YIG thin film elements may be disposed in respective recesses. Although magnetic field may be applied to the YIG thin film magnetic resonance elements 27, 28 and 55 of the filter circuit 2 and the local oscillator 5 by respective magnetic field applying means 6 and 7 as above described, the means 6 and 7 may be constituted commonly. For example, a yoke 81 of magnetic substance such as permalloy is installed as shown in Fig. 11, and in a magnetic gap 82 of the yoke 81 is disposed a substrate 91 on which the signal converter circuit as described in Fig. 9 and Fig. 10 is assembled. A coil 85 is wound on at least one of opposite magnetic poles 83 and 84 to constitute the magnetic gap 82 of the yoke 81, and the magnetic field applying means 6 and 7 are constituted commonly. Thus, the common magnetic field is applied to the YIG thin film elements 27, 28 and 55 of the filter circuit 2 and the local oscillator 5. This constitution can be applied to the case where the offset frequency is obtained by varying the aspect ratio in the YIG elements 27, 28 and 55. When different magnetic fields are applied to the YIG elements 27, 28 and 55 so as to obtain the offset frequency, as shown in Fig. 12 and Fig. 13, a permanent magnet 86 is locally arranged on at least one of the magnetic poles 83 and 84, or an auxiliary coil 87 is arranged there. Magnetic field from the magnet 86 or the coil 87 is superposed on magnetic field from the coil 85 in forward direction or reverse direction so that in the magnetic gap 82 the magnetic field intensity at the installation position of the magnet 86 or the coil 87 is different from that at other position by a prescribed amount, and the YIG elements 27, 28 of the filter circuit and the YIG element 55 of the local oscillator are arranged at positions different in the magnetic field intensity. When the offset frequency is varied thereby the intermediate frequency to be taken out from the mixer 4 is varied as in a receiver used in amateur radio communication, current flowing through the auxiliary coil 87 for example may be adjusted so as to adjust difference between magnetic fields applied to respective YIG elements of the filter circuit and the local oscillator. In the invention as above described, each resonator of the filter circuit 2 and the local oscillator 4 is constituted by a thin film element produced in thin film forming method to a magnetic resonance element. Suppression of spurious response magnetostatic mode is required in this case. The magnetic resonance element by monocrystalline sphere YIG monocrystalline sphere is advantageous in that magnetostatic mode is not easily excited thereby single resonance mode of uniform precessional mode is obtained. However, even if the YIG thin film is located in the high frequency magnetic field of good uniformity, since the internal d.c. magnetic field is not uniform, magnetostatic mode may be much excited. Magnetostatic mode when d.c. magnetic field is applied perpendicularly to surface of a ferrimagnetic specimen of disk shape is analyzed in the reference Journal of Applied Physics, vol. 48, July 1977, pp. 3001 3007 , and each mode is expressed by n, N Fig. 15 shows state of internal d.c. magnetic field Hi when d.c. magnetic field is applied in perpendicular direction to surface of a disk shaped YIG thin film with thickness t and diameter D radius r . Wherein the aspect ratio t D is sufficiently small to neglect distribution of the magnetic field in the specimen thickness direction. Since demagnetizing field is large at inside of the disk and abruptly becomes small at the periphery the internal d.c. magnetic field is small at portion near the center and abruptly becomes large near the periphery. According to the analysis result in the reference, if value of r R at position of Hi ω γ is assumed ξ, magnetostatic mode exists at region where O r R ξ. Wherein ω resonant angular frequency of magnetostatic mode, γ gyromagnetic ratio. When the magnetic field is fixed, as the mode number N becomes large, the resonance frequency becomes high and region of magnetostatic mode expands outwards as shown in Fig. 16A. Fig. 16B shows distribution of RF magnetization within the specimen in low order three modes of 1, N ₁ modes, and absolute value represents amount of RF magnetization and sign represents phase relation of RF magnetization. As clearly understood from Fig. 16, RF magnetization component has different forms depending on the magnetostatic mode. Utilizing this, excitation of magnetostatic mode becoming spurious response can be suppressed without a significant effect on the major resonance mode. More specifically, as shown in Fig. 17, YIG thin film element 27, 28 or 55 of circular shape is formed on the GGG substrate 29, 56 or 93, and an annular groove 70 is formed on the thin film element by means of selective etching for example so as to form an annular thin portion. In this case, each YIG thin film element is sufficiently thin and the magnetostatic mode is 1, N ₁ mode. The groove 70 is formed in concentric relation on position where RF magnetization of 1, 1 ₁ mode becomes zero. The groove as a whole may be continuous or diskontinuous. As shown in Fig. 18, region enclosed by the groove 70 may be made thin in comparison to outside region. In this case, demagnetizing field is elevated at inside region close to the groove 70, and becomes nearly uniform to this region. In other words, the internal d.c. magnetic field becomes nearly uniform throughout wide region in the radial direction as shown in dash and dot line of Fig. 16A. Consequently, excitation of magnetostatic mode other than the main resonance mode can be further suppressed. In such magnetic resonance element, the magnetization is restricted by the groove 70. Since the groove 70 exists at position where the RF magnetization becomes zero to 1, 1 ₁ mode, excitation of 1, 1 ₁ mode is not affected. On the contrary, since the RF magnetization to other mode is not essentially zero at the position of the groove 70, the magnetization is partially accelerated thereby excitation of such mode is reduced. Consequently, the spurious response can be suppressed without deteriorating the main resonance mode. Since distribution of RF magnetization in the YIG thin film refer to Fig. 16B has no relation to amount of saturated magnetization of the specimen and is not largely dependent on the aspect ratio, even if the saturated magnetization or the film thickness of the ferrimagnetic layer is different, position of the groove need not be varied corresponding to the difference. In this connection, YIG thin film element of film thickness 20µm and radius 1mm was produced from YIG thin film and a groove 70 of depth 2µm was formed on position of radius 0.8mm of the element, and ferromagnetic resonance regarding the specimen was measured using micro strip lines, thereby measuring results of the insertion loss were obtained as shown in Fig. 19. Unloaded Q value was 775. In a circular YIG thin film resonance element, the RF magnetization of 1, 1 ₁ mode was zero at position of r R 0.8. On the contrary, YIG thin film element of film thickness 20µm and radius 1 mm without groove was produced from the same YIG thin film, and ferromagnetic resonance regarding the specimen was measured using micro strip lines. The measuring results of the insertion loss were obtained as shown in Fig. 20. Unloaded Q value was 660. As clearly understood from comparison of both cases, the invention can suppress excitation of magnetostatic mode other than 1, 1 ₁ mode and also suppress the spurious response. Since the main resonance mode is not deteriorated, the unloaded Q value is not deteriorated. In order to suppress excitation of magnetostatic mode becoming spurious response in a magnetic resonance element by YIG thin film, i.e. ferrimagnetic thin film, inside region of the ferrimagnetic thin film may be made thinner than outside region. Such constitution will now be described. If d.c. magnetic field Ho is applied in perpendicular direction to film surface of the disk shaped YIG thin film of thickness t and diameter D radius r , internal d.c. magnetic field Hi becomes Hi Ho Hd r R Ha. Wherein Hd is demagnetizing field, and Ha is anisotropic magnetic field. The aspect ratio t D is sufficiently small and distribution of the magnetic field in the specimen thickness direction is neglected. Fig. 21 shows calculated value of demagnetizing field Hd of the YIG disk of radius 1mm. Since the demagnetizing field is large at inside of the disk and abruptly becomes small at the periphery, the internal d.c. magnetic field is small at portion near the center and abruptly becomes large near the periphery. On the contrary, Fig. 22 shows calculated value of the demagnetizing field of the YIG thin film where the film thickness within region of inside radius 0.8mm is made thinner by 1µm. It is seen from the figure that as the film thickness at inside region is made a little thinner the demagnetizing field is a little elevated at portion near the periphery of the thinned region and flat region of the demagnetizing field is enlarged. Consequently, if the inside region of the YIG thin film element is made thinner than the outside region, flat region of the demagnetizing field in the inside region can be enlarged thereby magnetostatic mode to cause the spurious response can be suppressed. As shown in Fig. 23, the ferrimagnetic YIG thin film element 27, 28 or 55 is formed on the GGG substrate 29, 56 or 93. A recess 71 is formed on the YIG thin film element 27, 28 or 55 thereby the inside region is made thinner than the outside region. Thickness of the YIG thin film element 27, 28 or 55 is made sufficiently small so that distribution of the magnetic field in the thickness direction becomes uniform. The magnetostatic mode is 1, N ₁ mode. The recess 71 is extended to position where excitation of the magnetostatic mode to cause the spurious response is sufficiently suppressed. It is preferably extended to position where amplitude of 1, 1 ₁ mode becomes zero. For example, if the YIG thin film is disk shape, the recess is extended to position of 0.75 0.85 times as large as the radius. In this connection, YIG thin film magnetic resonance element of film thickness 20µm and radius 1mm was formed and a circular recess 71 of depth 1.7µm and radius 0.75mm was formed on the resonance element in concentric relation, and ferromagnetic resonance regarding the specimen was measured using micro strip lines, thereby measuring results of the insertion loss were obtained as shown in Fig. 24. Unloaded Q value was 865. Resonance frequency by a magnetic resonance element such as YIG thin film element is dependent on the saturation magnetization of the element and therefore affected directly by temperature characteristics of the saturation magnetization. If resonance frequency of the YIG thin film elements 27 and 28 in the high frequency filter circuit 2 is varied depending on variation of the ambient temperature, the tuned frequency will get out of order. Consequently, the YIG thin film element in the filter circuit 2 and the YIG thin film element in the local oscillator to hold a definite offset frequency are preferably held to the resonance frequency irrespective of the ambient temperature. In order to hold the resonance frequency f wherein N In the case of using the electromagnet and also using the thermostat, however, current control is performed by external energy supply and therefore the constitution becomes complicated. One method to control temperature characteristics of the gap magnetic field H Assuming that the magnetic field and the magnetic flux density within the magnet and the soft magnetic plate are uniform and there is no leakage of the magnetic flux to circumstances, equations 9 and 10 are expressed as follows Substituting formula 13 to formula 12 , the gap magnetic field H Wherein N Consequently, in formula 16 , if characteristics and size of the magnet 102, i.e. H One soft magnetic plate, e.g. the first soft magnetic plate 113, is made of YIG plate having the same composition as that of the YIG element, and other soft magnetic plate, e.g. the second soft plate plate 114, is made of other magnetic substance such as ferrite plate. In Fig. 27, when the first soft magnetic plate 113 is made of YIG and the second soft magnetic plate 114 is made of Mg Mn Al ferrite, and the magnet 112 is a permanent magnet of SmCo₅ with diameter 30mm residual magnetic flux density Br 8134G, coercive force H When similar constitution to the above example was taken and the magnet 112 was a permanent magnet of CeCo₅ Br 6250G, H Further, when the magnet 112 was a permanent magnet of α 0.001 Br 6300G, H In conclusion, as temperature coefficient of the permanent magnet 112 approaches the average temperature coefficient 0.00128 estimated by formula 8 , frequency deviation Δf, i.e. temperature dependence can be reduced when the soft magnetic plates is constituted by YIG only. When two sorts of soft magnetic plates are used, f can be reduced if one of the soft magnetic plates is made of the same material as that of the magnetic resonance element. Temperature dependence of the resonance frequency can be reduced if the same YIG as that of the magnetic resonance thin film element is used in a soft magnetic plate as above described. This constitution will be described. In order to realize the ideal state that the temperature dependence becomes 0, the formula 8 and the formula 16 must be equal. Hence If temperature coefficient of the permanent magnet is quite small and H In order that both sides are always equal, the constant terms must be equal and the temperature dependent terms be equal respectively. Hence From formula 19 , it follows that Since the YIG element and the soft magnetic plate are sufficiently thin and therefore N Further, assuming that ℓ Next, description is in that if the permanent magnet has temperature coefficient β and YIG as constituting material of the magnetic resonance element is used in the soft magnetic plate the temperature characteristics will become quite well. When YIG is used in the soft magnetic plate, formula 17 is obtained by equalizing formula 8 and formula 16 , and further N Referring to Fig. 31, if temperature characteristics of the saturation magnetization are represented by line approximately using the average temperature coefficient a in the noticed temperature range T₁ T₂, it follows that Substituting formula 25 in formula 24 , Hence If the permanent magnet has linear temperature characteristics and the temperature coefficient is β, in order that formula 29 is satisfied, following formula is selected. Further, in order that formula 28 is satisfied, following formula is selected corresponding to strength H Then the gap magnetic field H T becomes On the other hand, when N That is, Δf is shift of 4πM Thus, it is understood that if YIG is used in the soft magnetic plate the magnetic apparatus can be constituted with excellent temperature characteristics hence with good compensation to the temperature dependence. When this constitution is applied to a signal converter of the invention in practice, the coil 85 is variably energized and magnetic field by the coil 85 is superposed with magnetic field by the magnet 112 and in some cases together with the auxiliary coil 87, the magnet 86 and the like, thereby the superposed magnetic field sets the resonance frequency or tuning frequency. Although any of above examples uses the soft magnetic plate of one or two sorts of constituting materials, three sorts of constituting materials or more may be used. A signal converter of the invention is not restricted to a tuner of superheterodyne type as described in Fig. 1, but other constitutions such as a tuner of double superheterodyne type may be used. An example of this constitution will be described referring to Fig. 33. Numeral 201 designates an antenna, numeral 202 a high frequency amplifier, numeral 203 a first mixer, numeral 204 a first local oscillator using a ferromagnetic resonator including YIG resonator element, numeral 205 a filter circuit by ferromagnetic resonator such as YIG resonator element, numeral 206 a second mixer, numeral 207 a second local oscillator also using a ferromagnetic resonator by including YIG resonator element, and numerals 208, 209 and 210 magnetic field applying means to YIG resonator elements of the first local oscillator 204, the second local oscillator 207 and the filter circuit 205, respectively. The magnetic field applying means 208 is variably constituted so that oscillation frequency of the first local oscillator 204, can be set variably. Other magnetic field applying means 210 and 209 supply fixed magnetic fields so that the passing frequency center frequency f In such circuit constitution, too, magnetic resonance elements such as YIG element for the first local oscillator 204, the second local oscillator 207 and the filter circuit 205 are formed by the thin film forming method. The YIG thin film magnetic resonance elements are made of the same material and set to the same shape and aspect ratio. For example, if the element is of disk shape, ratio of radius is set to the same value if the element is of square or rectangular shape, ratio of corresponding sides is set to the same value. Thus, a receiver having excellent temperature characteristics in itself can be constituted. Consequently, compensation of the temperature characteristics by arranging the soft magnetic plate having the same composition as that of the YIG magnetic resonance thin film element in the magnetic circuit as described in Fig. 25 through Fig. 32 may be obviated. The temperature characteristics in such constitution will be described. Resonance frequencies of YIG thin film resonator elements in the first local oscillator 204, the second local oscillator 207 and the filter circuit 205, that is, the oscillation frequencies f In Fig. 33, magnetic fields applied to the filter circuit 205 and the second local oscillator 207 are fixed and magnetic field applied to the first local oscillator 204 is adjusted for the tuning. However, magnetic field to the first local oscillator 204 may be fixed and magnetic fields to the filter circuit 205 and the second local oscillator 207 may be adjusted in interlocking for the tuning. An example in such constitution will be described referring to Fig. 34. Parts in Fig. 34 corresponding to Fig. 33 are designated by the same reference numerals, and the repeated description shall be omitted. In the example, signal converted in frequency f In this example, too, the temperature characteristics can be compensated by the circuit itself. In any example of Fig. 33 and Fig. 34, specifical structure of the filter circuit 205 and the first and second local oscillators 204 and 207 is similar to that of the filter circuit 2 and the local oscillator 5 in Fig. 1. Offset frequency in the filter circuit 205 and the second local oscillator 207 can be set in similar manner to the filter circuit 2 and the local oscillator 5 in Fig. 1 where prescribed d.c. bias magnetic field is applied in superposition to YIG element in one of the circuits. In Fig. 33 and Fig. 34, a fixed magnetic field is applied to a part of the circuit and a variable magnetic field is applied to another part of the circuit. In this case, YIG element or circuit including this to supply the fixed magnetic field and other YIG element or circuit including this to supply the variable magnetic field are assembled in separate yokes 81, i.e. separate magnetic circuits, so as to generate required fixed magnetic field and variable magnetic field. In a receiver of the invention as above described, constitution of magnetic resonance elements by machining such as YIG monocrystalline bulb or YIG monocrystalline plate is avoided, and YIG thin film elements are formed by thin film forming method such as liquid phase epitaxy, sputtering or chemical vapor deposit. Accordingly, mass production becomes easy, and characteristics between the filter circuit and the resonater in the local oscillator can be set accurately, thereby the tracking error can be effectively prevented without installing special circuit to correct the tracking error. Consequently, the invention is advantageous in that the constitution is simplified, the mass production becomes easy and the cost is reduced.
