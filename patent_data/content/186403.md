# SELECTIVE VAPORIZATION PROCESS

## Abstract
Coke or coke and hydrogen production may increase when the Asphalt residual Treating ART Process for removing metallic and carbonaceous contaminants from hydrocarbons is operated with feed stock containing impuri ties that result in the deposition on the solid particulate contact material of acidic metallic compounds such as heavy metal chlorides. Coke or coke and hydrogen production is reduced by charging ammonia or other fugitive basic nitrogen compounds to the system after burning coke from the circulating inventory of catalytically inert contact material and prior to selectively vaporizing incoming charge of feed stock in the presence of the hot regenerated contact material.
