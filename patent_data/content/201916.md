# BONDING METHOD OF SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICE

## Abstract
A bonding method of semiconductor device by using a film carrier A heat resistive insulating layer 110, 110a is deposited all over the surface of a dummy wafer 101 on which a photo resist film 105a having a predetermined pattern is previously formed The photo resist film 105a is removed together with the heat resistive insulating layer 110a for forming openings Bumps are formed on the openings by plating using the heat resistive insulating layer 110 as a mask After transferring the bumps to inner leads, the bumps of the inner leads are bonded to bonding pads of the semiconductor element.
