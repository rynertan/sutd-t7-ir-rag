# Track searching arrangement for an optical information recording and reproducing apparatus.

## Abstract
A track searching system for an optical information recording and reproducing apparatus in which a disc like information carrier 5 provided previously with concentric or spiral guide tracks 8, 30 of a channel like configuration is used as an information recording and storing means and adapted to be scanned by a light beam 2 for recording or retrival of information. Light flux 11, 17b reflected by the information carrier 5 and presenting variable distribution of light intensity 17b is received by paired photo electric elements 19a, 19b . A difference signal 23 and a sum signal 28 derived from the output signals from the photoelectric elements 19a, 19b or a reproduced RF signal representative of reproduced information undergo phase comparison processing at 25 , the result of which is utilized for determining the direction in which the guide track 8, 30 is traversed by the scanning light beam 2 and the number of tracks which have been traversed by the light beam. A desired track 57 is thus searched and accessed with high accuracy at a high speed for assuring a positive and rapid information recording or retrieval at the desired track regardless of eccentricity Î” of the information carrier, variations in the scanning speed and the presence of recorded track 103 .
