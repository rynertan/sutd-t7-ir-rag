# Voltage controlled variable frequency pulse oscillator.

## Abstract
The voltage controlled variable frequency pulse oscilla tor in accordance with the present invention comprises an integrating capacitor 50 , a variable current source 52 for generating charging current for said integrating capacitor in response to the controlling voltage, a fixed current source 54 for discharging said capacitor, a switching circuit 56 for controlling the discharge of said capacitor, a comparator 58 for outputting a discrimination signal by comparing the voltage of the capacitor and a reference voltage, a dn a multivibrator 60 for receiving the discrimination signal from the comparator and for outputting a pulse signal with a frequency corresponding to the controlling voltage from the variable current source. The multivibrator comprises an R S flip flop 64, 66 for receiving the discrimination signal output by the comparator at its set side OR NOR gates, and receiving and for inverting the output of the set side gate which is delayed by a prescribed time to the reset side OR NOR gate. The R S flip flop is constructed to permit the oscillation output with a prescribed frequency to be taken out from the reset side OR NOR gates, and the oscillation output of the R S flip flop controls the drive of the switching circuit. Therefore, the multivibrator starts oscillation on its own within a prescribed width when the capacitor voltage grows very large at the time of turning the power supply on or at the time of generation of an excessively large current where the output of the comparator continues to stay at a constant value. Furthermore, the current value of the fixed current source is set at more than twice the maximum current value of the variable current source. Because of this, the large voltage of the capacitor decreases gradually with ups and downs, and the comparator inverts after a certain time, the multivibrator discontinues the self oscillation, and the ordin ary operation of the device takes place.
