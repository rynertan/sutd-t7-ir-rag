## Description
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The polyphenylene ether resins are a well known family of linear thermoplastic engineering resins. A wide variety of these resins and a number of methods for their preparation are disclosed in Hay, U.S. Patent Nos. 3,306,874 and 3,306,875, as well as in Stamatoff, U.S. Patent Nos.3,257,357 and 3,257,358. The polyphenylene ether resins are admirable with other polymers as defined by Cizek, U.S. 3,383,435, and with thermoplastic elastomers conventionally used as auxiliary or modifying resins. Many of these are employed to improve the impact resistance of articles molded from the mixtures compositions of this type are disclosed inCizek, mentioned above, as well as in Cooper, et al.,U.S. Patent Nos. 3,974,235 4,101,504 4,101,505 and 4,172,929, and elsewhere. Many such compositions are normally flammable.The term I normally flammable as used herein is intended to mean not meeting the V O and V l requirements of the Underwriters Laboratories Bulletin No. 94 test.It is known that certain agents, e.g., aromatic phosphates, can be added to impart flame retardancy self extinguishing behavior and to also function as plasticizers for the composition. The resulting compositions often exhibit a combination of high heat distortion temperature the temperature at which a molded sample begins to deform , good resistance to breakage or fracture upon impact, and good fire resistance. There have, however, been some difficulties encountered in processing because of the high viscosity of the resins in the molten state.The high melt viscosity lowers the rate at which the resins can be molded in injection molding machines and increases the power required to maintain a given rate of production from extrusion machines. Righter processing temperatures can be used, but this can cause depolymerization, oxidation or other degradation of the resin. It has been proposed that the addition of low molecular weight hydrocarbon resins to certain polyphenylene ether resin blends can enhance processing by reducing the molding temperature and melt viscosity. Compositions of this type are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,189,411 to Haaf, and U.K. Patent No. 1,344,729. INTRODUCTION TO THE INVENTION The discovery has now been made that when certain low molecular weight hydrocarbon resins are incorporated in unplasticized blends of polyphenylene ether resin and an impact modifier, the resultant composites are characterized by lower melt viscosity which facilitates molding as well as by high heat distortion temperature and good impact strength. Preferably, the low molecular weight hydrocarbon resin is selected from among coumarone indene resins, cyclopentadiene styrene resins, aromatic petroleum resins, cyclopentadiene indene resins, phenol coumarone indene resins and alpha methyl styrene resins. Commercially available forms are illustrated in the examples. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The polyphenylene oxide resins useful in accordance with the present kinds of compositions are, as previously indicated, individually well known. There are, however, various preferred compositions components.These are primarily ones commonly having applications for which high impact strength is particularly desirable. The preferred polyphenylene ethers are homoand copolymers of the formula EMI4.1 wherein Q, , QW and Q , are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, hydrocarbon radicals, halohydrocarbon radicals having at least two carbon atoms between the halogen atom and the phenol nucleus, hydrocar tonoxy radicals and halohydrocarbonoxy radicals having at least two carbon atoms between the halogen atoms and the phenol nucleus, and Q , Q and Q in addition may be halogen with the proviso that Q and Q are preferably free of a tertiary carbon atom and n represents the total number of monomer residues and is an integer of at least 50. Especially preferred is poly 2, 6 dimethyl l ,4 phenylene ether . These can be prepared by following the teachings of the aforementioned patents. The polyphenylene ether resin is preferably in admixture with one or more polymeric impact modifiers.The impact modifier can be styrene homopolymer in admixture or otherwise modified with an elastomeric material such as a natural or synthetic rubber, or a styrene containing elastomeric copolymer or terpolymer. By way of illustration, the impact modifier may be a homopolymer such as polystyrene, polychlorostyrene, poly alpha methyl styrene , or poly para methyl styrene which has been modified by natural or synthetic rubber, for example, polybutadiene, polyisoprene, butyl rubber, EPDM rubber, natural rubber, polysulfide rubbers, polyurethane rubbers, etc., elastomeric styrene copolymers such as styrene butadiene copolymers, styrene acrylonitrilebutadiene terpolymers ABS , block copolymers of styrene and a diene in their various forms, for example, A B, A B A,A B AB, A B A B A, etc., random or radial teleblock copolymers of these same materials, as well as hydrogenated forms of the linear, random and radial copolymers in which the aliphatic unsaturation, e.g., of the B diene block has been reduced and admixtures of any of the above mentioned styrene homopolymers with any of the above mentioned elastomeric styrene co and terpolymers. Blends of the polyphenylene ether resin and impact modifier can contain these materials in virtually any desired proportion, e.g., from 20 1 to 1 2 parts by weight. Only a small amount of the low molecular weight hydrocarbon is necessary to achieve the benefits of the invention. Amounts of at least about 0.1 percent by weight, and generally from about 1.0 to 25.0 percent by weight, based on the total weight of resins, understood, however, that the amount of this ingredient can vary widely both within and without this range, depending on particular requirements. The molding compositions of this invention can and advantageously do contain one or more of the supplementary non resinous agents which have heretofore been customarily present in polyphenylene ether resin molding compositions to improve certain other physical and chemical properties of the moldings. The agents include antioxidants, strengthening fibers for example, glass fibers and graphite whiskers , mineral fillers, abrasion resistant components, dyes, pigments and so forth. Many of such agents are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,172,929 to Cooper et al. These are normally present in minor but effective amounts of between 1 and 50 by weight. The compositions are prepared in the conventional manner by blending the ingredients to form a pre mix, extruding the pre mix on a single or twin screw extruder, cooling and chopping the extrudate to molding size pellets and injection molding. Alternatively, a homogeneous melt of the ingredients can be formed which is cooled and cut or ground to size, then directly molded or first extruded and then molded. The following examples illustrate the invention.These are intended as preferred embodiments only and are not meant to be a limitation on the scope of the invention.All proportions are stated on a parts by weight basis. EXAMPLES Compositions were prepared by blending 80 parts of poly 2,6 dimethyl l,4 phenylene ether resin PPO,General Electric Co. , 10 parts of polystyrene polybutadienepolystyrene Shell s KG 1651, having a hydrogenated midblockx 20 parts of the low molecular weight hydrocarbon resins noted below, 0.15 part of zinc sulfide and 0.15 part of zinc oxide. The blend pre mixes were extruded through a 28 mm twin screw Werner Pfleiderer machine at 580 F., then molded into test bars at an injection temperature of 575 OF. 270 OF. mold temperature .
