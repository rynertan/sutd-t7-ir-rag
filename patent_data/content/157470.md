# MAGNETIC FIELD SENSOR

## Abstract
An alternating magnetic excitation field is generated in the flux concentrators 11, 12 of a Hall effect device, including a Hall element 13 , by passing an a.c. current through a coil 14 . This alternating field serves to drive the flux concen trators into and out of saturation. In the presence of a d.c. magnetic field and when a Hall current is applied to the Hall element, a second harmonic component is generated in the output voltage of the Hall element 13 the amplitude of the second harmonic component providing a measure of the d.c. magnetic field. In an alternative arrangement the flux concentrator means is in loop form rather than in a flat con figuration.
