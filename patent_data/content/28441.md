# Foam extrusion apparatus and method.

## Abstract
An extrusion system for the production of foam boards, billets and the like products includes an extruder 20 at a first higher elevation 22 extruding foamable resin through a die in the upper end of an elongated vacuum chamber in the form of an inclined barometric leg 26 which extends at its lower end into a shallow but large surface area pool 39 of liquid such as water. An elongated shroud or hood 44 on the lower end of the leg reduces the pressure head of water above the foam product as it exits the leg and moves out of the pool for processing at a lower second elevation. The large area of the pool reduces its depth for a given volume and minimizes fluctuations in the level of the pool and the pressure head above the product when the vacuum changes. In one embod iment the pool extends beneath substantially the entire floor of the building 30 enclosing the second lower elevation 31 in which the subsequent processing occurs, In another embodiment the pool extends beneath the leg with the pool also serving as structural footings for the support of the leg and the platform forming the first higher elevation.
