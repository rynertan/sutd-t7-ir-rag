# Proteinaceous foaming composition, a method for the production of a foamed proteinaceous product and a method for preparing a continuous surface coating on a substrate.

## Abstract
The combination of certain polyvalent metal ions with certain proteinaceous foaming agents significantly enhances the efficacy of proteinaceous foaming compositions. The present invention affords the means for achieving signifi cantly improved protein foam from vegetable protein hydro lyzates which normally fail to possess the foaming efficacy of conventional proteinaceous foam agents such as egg albu men and caseinates. The improved foamed products may be obtained by employing a combination of polyvalent ions such as calcium and zinc with enzymatically hydrolyzed soy protein whipping agents which are soluble throughout the pH range 4 to 7. The proteinaceous foaming compositions may be utilized for a variety of industrial and food applica tions and are particularly useful in providing coated paper products.
