# Liquid crystal element driving apparatus.

## Abstract
An apparatus for driving a liquid crystal element 8 by an increased voltage and at a lowered frequency in conformi ty with temperature fall in the liquid crystal element 8 so as to achieve complete driving of the element even in a low temperature range. In order to increase the driving voltage, the apparatus comprises a booster circuit 3 for increasing a battery voltage, and a voltage divider circuit 4 including an element temperature sensor 41 as a component thereof and serving to produce a control voltage V2 by dividing the output voltage V1 of the booster circuit 3 . In such configuration, the booster circuit 3 performs its operation in such a manner as to maintain constant the control voltage V2 obtained from the voltage divider circuit 4 .
