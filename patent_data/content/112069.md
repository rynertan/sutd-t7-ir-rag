## Description
A ROTARY VALVEn The present invention relates to valves and more particularly to rotary valves. Still further the present invention relates to rotary valves for combustion engines whether they be internal or external combustion engines. It should further be appreciated that the present invention is also applicable to rotary valves to control the flow of fluids to and from variable volume working spaces, e.g. in pumps and compressors. With particular reference to valves employed in internal combustion piston engines, known rotary valves have not been widely accepted as they have not provided the advantages of conventional valves in respect of simplicity of construction, cost of manufacture, oil consumption, durability and ruggedness. A rotary valve arrangement is disclosed in U.S. PatentNo. 985,618 to Miller. The patent to Miller discloses a rotary valve including a valve housing formed integral with the head of the engine and which receives a valve rotor which communicates with the combustion chamber via an annular sealing ring generally coaxial with the port communicating with the combustion chamber. More particularly the patent to Miller relates to this annular sealing member and its configuration whereby under combustion pressures the sealing members is forced into sealing contact with the valve rotar. Rotary valves are also disclosed in U.S. Patents Nos. 1347978 and 1573022, both to Wehr. The earlier patent to Wehr discloses a rotary valve assembly having a split housing to support a bush having a cylindrical inner surface to receive the valve rotor.This sleeve has a cylindrical outer surface eccentric with respect to the inner surface. The valve rotor communicates with the combustion chamber by means of a port extending through the sleeve and part of the housing.It should be particularly noted that the split housing is mounted on the cylinder and forms the head of the engine.The second patent to Wehr is a modification of the device disclosed in his earlier patent, and more particularly describes a means of biasing the sleeve into sealing contact with the valve rotar. The U.S. Patent No. 1887997 to Cross, also relates to a rotary valve arrangement and in particular relates to an annular sealing element which surrounds the port exiting from the combustion chamber and which sealingly engages the valve rotar. This annular sealing member is generally coaxial with the port extending from the combustion chamber. U.S. Patent No. 2048134, describes a rotary valve arrangement with the rotor being supported by a housing consisting of two portions which are spring biased together so as to engage the valve rotor. An annular sealing element surrounds the port exiting from the combustion chamber and also sealingly engages the valve rotor. U.S.Patent No. 1997133, to Cross, is an improvement on Cross s earlier Patent No. 1887997, and particularly relates to the annular sealing element surrounding the port exiting from the combustion chamber and sealingly engaging the rotor. It is again pointed out that this annular sealing element is generally coaxial with the port exiting from the combustion chamber. U.S. Patent No. 2158386, describes a rotary valve arrangement having a hollow housing within which is received a sleeve 25 supported in a spaced relationship relative to the housing. The sleeve defines a cylindrical passage which receives the valve rotor and the sleeve is attached to the cylinder head. More particularly this patent describes a method of constructing the sleeve particularly when the sleeve is constructed of two parts whereby the two parts are resiliently biased together by means of springs. U.S.Patents Nos. 2853980 and 3871340, toZimmerman, describe a rotary valve arrangement with the head of the engine having a cylindrical passage to receive the valve rotor, formed integral with the head is a resilient support for the rotor and the arrangement further includes an annular sealing element which surrounds the port communicating with the combustion chamber. This annular sealing element is generally coaxial with the port and engages the valve rotor. U.S. Patent No. 3990423, to Cross, describes a rotary valve arrangement with the valve rotor supported in a two part housing with one of the housing parts forming the cylinder of the engine. The two part housing is biased together by means of a spring arrangement with the valve rotor communicating with the combustion chamber by means of a port.An annular sealing element is located around the port and sealingly engages the valve rotor. These known rotary valves have suffered from the drawbacks of most rotary valves in that they are generally costly to manufacture and lack durability and ruggedness and consume excessive amounts of oil or require external oil control methods. It should be noted that in each of the prior rotary valves described above, there is not provided a two part seal arrangement to sealingly connect the rotor with the head or block. More particularly there is not provided a first sealing device to engage the rotor and a second sealing device to engage the first sealing device and sealingly connect it with the head or block of the engine. It is an object of the present invention to overcome or substantially ameliorate the above disadvantages. A combination including a body having a cylinder to receive a piston to cooperate therewith in providing a variable volume working space by reciprocation of the piston longitudinally of the cylinder, a cavity formed in said body and extending from said space, a rotary valve assembly to govern the flow of gas through said working space, said assembly comprising a generally cylindrical valve rotor having two longitudinal passages, said passages exiting on the longitudinal peripheral surface of said rotor so as to provide two rotor ports located substantially the same distance along the rotor but angularly spaced thereabout so as to alternately communicate with said space via a gas flow passage extending through said cavity upon rotation of said rotor in phase with said piston, bearing means supporting the rotor within said body for rotation about its longitudinal axis, a rotor sealing means mounted in said cavity but generally confined thereby and including a first sealing device sealingly engaging said rotor and encompassing a portion of said gas flow passage so as to partly define same, and a resilient second sealing device sealingly located within said cavity and sealingly connecting said rotor and body and also encompassing said gas flow passage so as to partly define same. A preferred form of the present invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, where in Figure 1 is a schematic sectioned side elevation of a rotor valve assembly in association with a combustion chamber of an internal combustion engine Figure 2 is a schematic sectioned and elevation of the valve assembly of Figure 1 Figure 3 is a schematic parts exploded sectioned end elevation of the seal assembly for the valve rotor of the valve of Figure 1 Figure 4 is a schematic bottom plan view of the assembly of Figure 3 as seen from the combustion chamber Figure 5 is a schematic side elevation of a seal assembly used in the assembly of Figure 1 Figure 6 is a schematically developed plan view for the split seal used in the seal assembly of Figure 3 Figure 7 is a schematic sectioned side elevation of a portion of the assembly of the seal of Figure 5. In the following preferred embodiment of the present invention, an improved rotary valve is provided which results from the realisation that many of the disadvantages of prior rotary valves, as described previously, can be overcome by providing a two part seal arrangement to sealingly connect the rotor with the head or block of an engine. In the present instance a first sealing device is employed to engage the rotor and then a resilient seal is used to connect the sealing device with the head or block of the engine. This allows movement of the valve rotor while still maintaining sealing contact therewith. A particular advantage of such a combination is that it is considerably less complex than previous valve assemblies. In Figures 1 to 3 there is schematically depicted a rotary valve assembly 10 in association with a cylinder head 11 mounted on an engine block 49. The head 11, in combination with a co operating piston 12 and cylinder 13, defines a combustion chamber 14. The rotary valve assembly 10 includes a rotor 15 which includes longitudinally extending passages 16 and 17 which terminate on the longitudinal periphery surface of the rotor 15 so as to provide two rotor parts 43 and 44. The rotor parts 43 and 44 are angularly spaced about the longitudinal axix of the rotor 15 so as to alternately communicate with a head port 19 extending from the chamber 14. The passages 16 and 17 control the flow of fuel to, and the flow of expended exhaust gases from, the combustion chamber 14. In operation of the valve assembly 10, the rotor 15 is rotated about its longitudinal axis so that the passages 16 and 17 are alternately brought into communication with the combustion chamber 14 in a timed sequence with movement of the piston 12. The assembly 10 further includes a sealing combination 20 illustrated in Figure 3 in a parts exploded end elevation. The sealing combination 20 includes a split housing 23 consisting of a btttom member 21 which co operates with a top member 22 to define a generally circular cavity 26 which rotatably receives the generally cylindrical rotor 15. The members 21 and 22 also co operate to define a cube and have there end faces spaced by a gap S1. The split housing 23 further includes bolts 24 which in combination with springs 25 secure the two support members 21 and 22 together and bias them toward the rotor 15. The member 21 is formed with the port 19 extending from the chamber 14.Located within the circular cavity 26 is a split generally cylindrical hollow rotor seal 27 in the form of a sleeve which is supported on the generally cylindrical surfaces 28 and 29 of the members 21 and 22. As the two members 21 and 22 are urged together by means of the springs 25, the seal 27 is biased to define a generally cylindrical configuraion conforming to the outer cylindrical surface of the roto 15. The seal assembly 20 acts as a seal in retaining the combustion gases within the chamber 14. The extremities 30 of the seal 27 co operate to define a generally arcuate shaped groove 32 within which is located a sealing strip 31 which is made of generally pliable material such as an elastomer so as to conform to its surrounding surfaces to prevent oil travelling along the groove 32. The strip 31, which is also depicted in Figures 5 and 7, is biased to engagement within the groove 32 by means of a resilient leaf type spring 33 also depicted inFigure 5. However the springs 23 could also take the form of coil springs. The split seal 27, in combination with the spring loaded housing 23 and with the sealing strip 31, enable the rotor 15 to be constructed of different material to that of the supporting and sealing combination 20 by compensating for different thermal expansion rates of the materials employed.Additionally the split seal 27 in combination with the spring loaded housing 23 compensates for the variation in expansion of the rotor 15 and of the seal assembly 20 due to changing the temperature conditions to which the valve assembly 10 is subjected to. With particular reference to Figure 7 it can be seen that the sealing strip 31 has a end 46 of circular cross section and which is the pliable portion of the strip 31 which sealingly slidingly engages the surfaces 47 of the groove 32. As the seal 27 expands and contracts due to changing temperature conditions within the engine, the end 46 will compensate for movement between the surfaces 47. Additionally the sealing strip 31 slidingly engages the rotor 15 and acts to prevent oil passing the sealing strip 31. The strip 31 also forces oil through the passages 39, which drain oil from the grooves 38, by acting as a dam. The rotor 15 is supported by means of bearings 34 while the seal 27 sealingly engages the external surface of the rotor 15. Accordingly the seal 27 provides an effective seal about the rotor 15 to inhibit the flow of oil to the combustion chamber 14 and the flow of gases through the valve assmebly 10 other than that permitted to exit or enter by means of the passages 16 and 17. This is achieved by pressure being applied to the surfaces of the valve rotor 15 and the inner surface of the seal 27 in the area adjacent the port 19. This pressure is applied firstly to the flat surface 48 of the bottom member 21 and is transmitted to its inner surface 28 and then to the outer surface of seal 27. The pressure which is largely proportional to the pressure of gas in the combustion chamber 14 is created by a the force transmitted through the lower part of the member 21, arising from combustion pressures acting on area 48 see Fig. 4 , b deformation of the resilient seal 36, and c the preload forces applied by the springs 25. The split housing 23 is located in a cavity 45 provided in the head 11 and extending from the combustion chamber 14. The split housing has a clearance 35 around its periphery to enable self alignment and movement of the sealing combination 20 relative to the head 11. The split housing 23 is sealingly engaged with the head 11 by means of a resilient seal 36 which has flexible flanges so as to generally define a V shape configuraion in transverse longitudinal cross section. The resilient seal 36 permits rocking movement of the members 21 and 22 while still retaining sealing contact between the head 11 and member 21 and clearance variations due to thermal expansion. In use the seal 36 is resiliently deformed so that the flanges are biased to engage the head 11 and bottom member 21. under high pressure conditions the flanges are forced outwardly to further enhance sealing contact with the head 11 and member 21. Preferably the seal 36 would be machined from a single piece of high temperature alloy steel with the flanges tapering towards their inner extremities. By providing a seal 36 of relatively small diameter, between the head 11 and the bottom support member 21, the force applied to the rotor 15 by the combustion gases can be reduced by reduction of the area 48, of the member 21, exposed to the combustion chamber 14. Now with reference also to Figure 6 wherein the split seal 27 is illustrated in plan view, with the seal 27 flattened for ease of description. The seal 27 includes two oil ports 37 which deliver oil to the load bearing surfaces of the seal 27. Defined in the seal 27 is a passage 18 which provides for communication between the combustion chamber 14 and the passages 16 and 17. Additionally the seal 27 is provided with two oil control grooves 38 which inhibit the transfer of oil from lubricated load bearing areas 52 to an areas the seal 27 which will te exposed to the combustion chamber 14, or ports 16 and 17. The seal 27 also provides two load bearing areas 52 to support the split housing 23 and retains it in position. Communicating with the oil control grooves 38 are passages 39 which provide for the draining of oil from the grooves 38. Oil is delivered to the pots 37 by means of an oil gallery 40 which is depicted in Figure 2. Additionally the seal 27 would be provided with a location indentation 41 which receives a location peg 42 to prevent rotation of the seal 27. It should be appreciated that the oil control grooves 38 act as a barrier between the lubricated load bearing areas 52 and the areas exposed to the passages 16 and 17 and the port 19. More particularly side leakage from the hydrodynamically lubricated areas 51 enters the oil control grooves 38 and is carried by rotation of the rotor 15 to drainage passages 39. Cooling of the rotary valve 10 may be achieved by a water jacket which permits the flow of water past the rotary valve assembly 10, and more particularly past the sides of the split housing 23. To prevent the escape of water from the water jacket there would be provided seals which sealingly contact the external surface of the split housing 23. This particular cooling system would enable the rapid distribution and extraction of heat from the rotary valve assembly 10. Cooling of the rotary valve assembly 10 may also be achieved by a plurality of fins which dissipate heat by measn of radiation and conduction to the surrounding air medium. Again this particular system provides for the rapid dissipation of heat from the rotary valve assembly 10. More particularly the fins would be formed integral with the support member 22, however member 21 could also be provided with fins. It should be appreciated that heat conduction from the rotor 15 is enhanced by the area of contact between the seal 27 and the rotor 15, and in turn the area of contact between the seal 27 and the support members 21 and 22 and the cube shape of the sealing combination 20. The heat transfer between members 21 and 22 is enhanced by the large area of contact and contact pressure between the two members 21 and 22. This contact force results from transverse pressure between the vertical abutting sides of the seal members 21 and 22. Additionally as the area 48 of the sealing combination 20 exposed to the combustion chamber 14 is minimised, so too is the heat absorbed by the seal combination 20 due to its exposure to the heat within the combustion chamber 14. The area 48 is reduced by providing the head ll with flange portions 50 which project radially inwardly above the cylinder 13. Heat absorption into sealing combination 20 is further reduced by minimising the length of port 19 in bottom member 21. Shortening of port 19 is made possible by split housing construction of seal assembly 20 in combination with resilient seal 36. To aid in heat transfer, the members 21 and 22 have elongated sides 53 and 54 to increase the area of contact between the members 21 and 22.
