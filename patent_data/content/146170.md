# Process for purifying 2,6 xylenol.

## Abstract
Process for purifying raw 2,6 xylenol, comprising the following stages, carried out in succession melting of raw 2,6 xylenol slow and uniform cooling of said molten raw 2,6 xyle nol until at least from 60 to 100 of its mass is separated as crystal solid gradual heating of said crystal solid, after having sep arated the possibly remaining liquid fraction, up to a highest temperature value lower by 0,1 5 C, then the solidification temperature of 2,6 xylenol, in order to causing surface melt ing on said crystals separation of the thus obtained molten liquid phase and recovery of purified 2,6 xylenol.
