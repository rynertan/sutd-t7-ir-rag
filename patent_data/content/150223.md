# PROCESS FOR MANUFACTURING CARBON FIBER AND GRAPHITE FIBER.

## Abstract
A process for manufacturing carbon fiber or graphite fiber, which comprises melt spinning a carbonaceous pitch, infusibilizing the resulting pitch fiber, carbonizing and, if necessary, graphitizing it. A precursor of the carbonaceous pitch is centrifuged in a molten state to simultaneously separate a solid slurry layer and an optically anisotropic phase contained in the precursor, and the latter phase is used as the carbonaceous pitch.
