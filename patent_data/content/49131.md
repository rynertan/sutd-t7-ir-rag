# Power transmission belt manufacture.

## Abstract
A power transmission belt 10 of improved manufacture in cludes a novel reinforcing fabric 4 in the inner portion of the compression section 3 of the belt. The fabric 4 is formed of yarns 20 having a low coefficient of thermal contraction and a high bias elongation to break. The yarns 20 are formed of a mixture of natural and synthetic resin fibers and are subjected to heat treatment to effect the improved low coefficient of ther mal contraction and high bias elongation to break.
