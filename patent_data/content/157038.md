The barrel 5, 29, 44 is of annular shape and is biased towards a breech block 16, 27 at the rear end of a bore 4, 45 in a support or body 1, 28, 43 of the gun. A firing pin 15 is conveniently fixed to the breech block 16, 17 as the barrel and shell or cartridge strike same and the movement of the barrel 5, 29, 44 is controlled by a trigger mechanism.
