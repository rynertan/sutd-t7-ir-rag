# A fuel supply or injection device for a multicylinder engine.

## Abstract
Described is an electronic fuel supply device for an automotive engine 1 , comprising a vortex flow sensor 4 for sensing the flow of suction air into the engine 1 , electromagnetic valve means 18, 19 driven for a predermined time in synchronism with the frequency output from the vortex flow sensor 4 to permit the passage of fuel therethrough, and a control valve 22 for limiting the flow of fuel through said electro magnetic valve means 18, 19 . The fuel is metered by the electro magnetic valve means 18, 19 and the control valve 22 , and the fuel may thus be supplied in metered amounts to the fuel injection valves 5, 5 , 5 , 5 in the respec tive cylinders for injection into the engine 1 .
