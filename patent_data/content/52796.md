More preferred is nylon 6 or nylon 66 having a carboxyl group attached to one end and an amino group attached to the other end of the polyamide chain. Carboxylic acid containing comonomers suitable for preparing the ethylene carboxylic acid copolymer include those monomers selected from the group consisting of unsaturated monocarboxylic acids of 3 to 6 carbon atoms, unsaturated dicarboxylic acids of 4 to 8 carbon atoms, and mixtures thereof. Representative examples of such monomers include acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, crotonic acid, maleic acid, and fumaric acid.

Ester containing monomers suitable for preparing the ethylene alkyl ester copolymers of the present invention are those C1 to C4 alkyl esters of the aforementioned carboxylic acid containing monomers, preferably acrylic acid and methacrylic acid, or other substituted acrylic acids. Representative examples of such esters include methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl and t butyl esters of such acids. Preferred are methyl and ethyl acrylate and methyl and ethyl methacrylate more preferred is ethyl acrylate and ethyl methylate most preferred is ethyl acrylate. A preferred olefin suitable for use in the present copolymers is ethylene. Therefore, in the most preferred embodiments of the present invention, the nylon6 or nylon 66 compositions will contain minor proportions of ethylene acrylic acid copolymer EAA and ethylene ethyl acrylate copolymer EEA as well as the modiìer.The polyamide ingredient amounts to about 60 98 percent by weight of the composition, the balance consisting essentially of EAA and EEA and an effective amount of inorganic modifier. Moreover, these preferred copolymers of ethy lene each contain from 1 to 20 mol percent of the said comonomer preferably, 3 15 mol percent, and more preferably 3 5 mol percent of acrylic acid monomer in theEAA copolymer and preferably 5 10 mol percent of the ethyl acrylate in the EEA copolymer. The preferred copolymers are characterized by a melt index in the range of 2 20 g 10 min. as measured by ASTM D 1238 employing a load of 2,160 g and a temperature of 1900C. The polyamides, nylon 6 and nylon 66, as well as the ethylene copolymers suitable for use herein, can be prepared by any conventional polymerization processes used in the art. Especially preferred compositions of the present invention generally contain about 2 to 40, more preferably 12 to 30, weight percent of ethylene copolymers. There is from 1 part of acid copolymer to 10 parts of ester copolymer up to 30 parts of acid copolymer to 1 part of ester copolymer by weight.Preferably, there is from 1 to 10 weight percent of the ester copolymer, and from 1 to 30 weight percent of the acid copolymer. More preferably, there is from 10 to 30 weight percent of the acid copolymer. The composition contains about 60 to 98 weight percent, and preferably 70 to 88 weight percent, of nylon 6, nylon 66, or mixtures thereof, having a melt index ASTM D 1238, condition Q , 1000 g load at 2350C. in the range of 2 to 20 g 10 minutes, and containing up to 15 by weight, based on the nylon ingredient, of nylon monomer and water extractable oligomers, of either nylon 6 or nylon 66 type. There is from about 0.05 to 1.0 weight percent, preferably 0.10 to 0.75 weight percent, and more preferably 0.2 to 0.6 weight percent of inorganic modifier. All weight percents are based on the total weight of the composition. The inorganic modifier is a metal compound described in detail below. An improvement in impact properties is experienced by the blend containing the impact modifier. Although the mechanism leading to the improvement in impact is not clear, it is clear that there is an improvement not resulting from the neutralization of the carboxylic acid groups of the acid copolymer by the metal cation of the metal compound to form an ionic copolymer in situ. This is particularly illustrated by reviewing Example 8. In Example 8, the metal cation of the metal compound, antimony oxide, does not react with the carboxylic acid groups of the acid copolymer, under the extrusion mixing conditions similar to those used to blend the high impact composition of the present invention. However, considering the art relating to the formation of ionic copolymers, such asU.S.Patent 3,264,272, the conditions necessary to neutralize the carboxylic acid groups of the acid copolymer in the composition of the present invention are not present during the blending of the composition.Therefore, even if metal compounds which are basic enough to theoretically react to neutralize the carboxylic groups are used in the composition of the present invention, the conditions under which the composition is blended may not be sufficient for the reaction to proceed with any significance, if at all. The improvement in impact by the addition of such metal compounds is, therefore, not dependent on the formation of an ionic copolymer. Metal compounds suitable for use as modifiers are those compounds wherein the metal or cation is selected from groups IA, IB, IIA, IIB, IIIA, IVA, VA,VIB, VIIB, and VIIIB of the Periodic Table of theElements. Preferred metals are lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium, beryllium, magnesium, zinc, cadmium, strontium, aluminum, lead, chromium, molybdenum, manganese, iron, cobalt, germanium, nickel, copper, silver, mercury, tin, platinum, boron, antimony, bismuth, and palladium. More preferred are antimony, copper, manganese, zinc, lithium, calcium, and lead.Most preferred is antimony. The anion portion of the metal compound is selected from the group consisting of oxides, hydrides, formates, acetates, alcoholates, glycolates and halides. More preferred are oxides, halides and acetates, and most preferred are oxides.Particularly preferred are antimony oxide and magnesium oxide. The compounds set forth on pages 388 9, Volume 54 of Journal of Polymer Science 1961 , are suitable for use as modifiers in the present invention. The metal compound modifier is present in the instant polyamide compositions in an effective amount, and by the term effective amount is meant that amount of modifier required to increase the Izod impact resistance of molded articles of the present polyamide compositions.Generally, the amount of modifier required for such an increase ranges from about 0.05 to 1.0 wt. based on the total weight of the composition. The precise amount of modifier is dependent on such factors as concentration of each of the ingredients and the mixing or extruding conditions such as temperature, shear, etc., which can be easily determined by routine experimentation. The molding compositions of the present invention can also contain conventional additives in small quantities such as specifically up to about 0.25 percent by weight of a metal soap as mold release agent or extrusion aid, and optionally a heat stabilizer such as a stabilizer based on copper. The present compositions can also contain plasticizers such as nylon 6 or nylon 66 water extractable oligomers, also referred to herein as nylon oligomers, in amounts preferably not over 15 by weight of the polyamide ingredient. They can also include colorants, such as pigments and carbon black, as well as conventional antioxidants and stabilizers. The molding compositions of the present invention are prepared by homogeneously mixing the ingredients at temperatures between about 230 to 3400C, preferably 260 to 3000C, in conventional homogeneous mixing machines. By the term homogeneously mixing is meant a thorough intense mixing of the components under conditions where high shear stresses prevail, particularly intense knead ing. Especially suitable machines for homogeneous mixing include the one shaft or multi shaft screw extruders, kneaders, and calenders which have a plurality of pairs of rollers. The examples which follow illustrate our invention and set forth the best modes which we have contemplated for carrying out the invention, but are intended as illustrative only and not as limiting. Example 1 As indicated in Table I below, various nylon 6 compositions were prepared with ethylene ethyl acrylate EEA and or ethylene acrylic acid EAA copolymers.The EEA copolymer was that commercially available fromUnion Carbide under the trademark BAKELITE flexible ethylene copolymer DPD 6169, described as having a melt index of 6 g 10 min. and ethyl acrylate content of 18 weight percent about 5.8 mol percent . The EAA copolymer was that commercially available from Dow Chemical as DOW EAAResin 455, described as having a melt index of 5.5 g 10 min. and acrylic acid content of 8 weight percent about 3.3 mol percent . The ingredients, in pellet form except for the inorganic modifier, were dry blended for about 20 minutes and then mixed and extruded under shearing action by anNRM single screw extruder in the melt and extruded as a strand which was cooled and pelleted. The extruder was maintained at an RPM of 31, contained four heating zones, all of which were at a temperature of 3000C, and the die was at a temperature of 2600C.

Example 7 Following the general procedure and utilizing the apparatus described above in Example 1, two molding compositions, listed below in Table IV, were prepared and injection molded. The composition contained nylon 66 polyamide in place of nylon 6. The EEA and EAA copolymers used were the same as described above in Example 1. The compositions were prepared by first dry blending the components together on a roll mill. The compositions were then extruded through the above described NRM extruder, containing a 2 1 2 6.35 cm extrusion die, which was at a temperature of 2430C. The extruder zone temperatures were Z 5800F 3040C , Z2 5600F 2930C , Z3 5300F 2770C and Z4 5000F 2600C . Z1 being the initial zone and Z4 being the exit zone prior to the die .

Example 8 This example is included to show that the improved impact resistance obtained by the addition of the metal compound, in particular antimony oxide, is not the result of the formation of an ionic copolymer insitu by the metal cation of the metal compound neutralized by the carboxylic acid groups of an ethylene acrylic acid copolymer. Ethylene acrylic acid copolymer DOW EAA 455 was extruded through an NRM extruder, at 2500C to 2600C, with sufficient antimony oxide for 1008 neutralization of the copolymer acid groups. Infrared analysis showed a complete absence of any absorption the frequencies around 1560 cm , characteristic of carboxylate ions. It is noted that the inability of the antimony to neutralize the carboxylic acid groups is not unexpected under the blending conditions used, considering the lack of basicity of the antimony oxide.It is noted that the probability of forming an ionic copolymer in situ in the composition of the present invention is further diminished by dilution of EAA with nylon and EEA. This result indicates that improved impact properties of the polyamide composition do not result from the formation of an ionic copolymer in situ. Examples 9 13 Examples 9 13, summarized in Table V below, are for various nylon 6 compositions. These compositions contain ethylene ethyl acrylate copolymer EEA , UnionCarbide, DPN6169 See Ex. 1 , and ethylene acrylic acid copolymer EAA , DOW EAA 455 See Ex. 1 . Each Example includes .25 by weight of zinc stearate ZnS as a mold release agent. The ingredients were blended in anNRM 6.35 cm. 2 1 2 inch single screw extruder.
