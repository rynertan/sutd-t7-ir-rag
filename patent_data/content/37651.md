# Molding device for molding a liner on the inside surface of the top panel of a container closure shell.

## Abstract
A molding device is provided for forming a liner on the inside surface of the top panel of a container closure shell. The device comprises a support for an inverted closure shell hav ing a quantity of formable liner material on the inside surface of its top panel a molding tool disposed above the anvil including a main body, a centre punch fixed to the lower end portion of the main body, and a vertically movable annular bushing surrounding the centre punch and means for raising and lowering the main body of the molding tool and the anvil relative to each other. The annular bushing is mounted for raising or lowering relative to the main body of the molding tool over a predetermined range. The molding tool further includes resilient means for raising the annular bushing rela tive to the main body of the molding tool and a driving mechanism for selectively lowering the annular bushing against the resistance of the resilient means.
