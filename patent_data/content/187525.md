# Process for producing L serine.

## Abstract
L serine is produced from 2 oxo oxazolidine 4 car boxylic acid OOC or a salt thereof by reaction with one or more suitable microorganisms. Some microorganisms con vert OOC to L serine, in particular they so convert L OOC. Other microorganisms racemize OOC. Thus, the latter mic roorganisms can if necessary be used to produce DL OOC, from which the former microorganisms can take L OOC as starting material for conversion into L serine.
