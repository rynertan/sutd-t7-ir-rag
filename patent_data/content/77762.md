# METHOD OF ROCK BOLTING AND ROCK BOLT

## Abstract
A rock bolt comprises an inflatable tube 11 which has a deep longitudinal depression 12 . A wire coil 20 is mounted on the tube before the bolt is inserted in the borehole. When pressurized by high pressure water the tube 11 expands and clamps the coil 20 between itself and the borehole and the tube 11 is thereby permanently anchored in the borehole. The depression 12 develops during the expansion but the coil 20 prevents full expansion of the tube 11 .
