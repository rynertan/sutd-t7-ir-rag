# Methods of and apparatus for forecasting and giving warning of automotive abnormalities.

## Abstract
An automotive abnormality forecasting and warning method and apparatus for issuing a voice and visual alarm when a signal representing the condition of an automotive inspection item such as water temperature exceeds a pre determined value, which comprise the steps of calculating the cooling water temperature change rate in variable cycles 103 , determining a calculation cycle corresponding to the detected water temperature and the calculated change rate from a memory storing the cooling water tem perature, water temperature change rate and calculation cycle in a predetermined relation 104 , judging whether the detected water temperature and the calculated change rate are in a predetermined water overheat region 105 , and issuing a voice alarm on an overheating trend in response to more than a predetermined number of the judging opera tions 107, 111 .
