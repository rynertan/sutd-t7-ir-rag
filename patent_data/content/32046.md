# Circuitry for protecting a semiconductor device against static electricity.

## Abstract
In a semiconductor device, such as a bipolar integrated circuit, an input element 12 requires protection, against possible damage by static electricity, by means capable of acting more rapidly and with less capacitance than a simple diode. Such means are provided by a PNP transistor 16 , having its emitter connected to an electrical reference potential point 14 of the device, and an NPN transistor 17 having its emit ter connected to a signal input point 10 of the input element 12 , and having its collector and base connected respectively to the base and collector of the PNP transistor 16 , there being a resistive connection 18 between the respective bases of the two transistors 16,17 .
