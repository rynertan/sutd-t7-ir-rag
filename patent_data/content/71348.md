# IMPROVEMENTS IN CYLINDER ASSEMBLIES

## Abstract
A cylinder assembly, such as an hydraulic damper, gas spring, and the like, comprises a cylinder 1 in which a piston 2 works against trapped volumes of hydraulic fluid and gas or air under pressure. The piston 2 is carried by the inner end of a piston rod 3, and the piston rod 3 passes through a removable closure 5 for the upper end of the cylinder 1, and works through a seal 18 at the inner end of a tubular member 7 which depends from the closure 5. A sealing ring 8 provides a fluid tight seal between the closure 5, the cylinder 1, and a radial flange 9 at the adjacent end of the tubular member 7. The sealing ring 8 has a tongue 13 which normally seals against a region surrounding an aperture 14 in the flange 9 to prevent fluid escaping from the cylinder 1, and the tongue 13 is resiliently deflectable upon release of the closure 5 to permit gas or air to escape through the aperture 14 at a controlled rate.
