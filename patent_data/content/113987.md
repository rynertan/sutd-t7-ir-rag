# Openwork screen assembly.

## Abstract
In order to provide a pleasing aesthetic appearance, and also in order to enable concealed, directional lighting 21 or 23 to be used, an openwork grid like suspended ceil ing system has outer squares 5 which contain four inner blades 7,7 forming an inner square 6 surrounded by four rectangles 8. The light fittings 21 or 23 are associated with the rectangles 8 so that the axis of the light fitting 21, 23 can be inclined. In order to enable the ceiling system to be packaged at low packing density, the four inner blades 7, 7 are hinged to each other and collapse so as to lie parallel to each other. After opening out, they can be hooked into the sides of the outer squares 5.
