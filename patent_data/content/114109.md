## Description
The present invention relates to an improvement of a semiconductor laser device and a method for manufacturing the same and, more particularly, to a semiconductor laser device using a III V group semiconductor material containing aluminum as a constituent element and a method for manufacturing the same. Recently, a compound semiconductor laser has been developed wherein a III V group semiconductor material is used to allow continuous oscillation at room temperature. In the semiconductor laser of this type, it is very important, for widening the range of applications, to control a transverse mode by a built in waveguide structure and to obtain a laser beam of stable basic transverse mode oscillation which is free from astigmatism. A rib waveguide laser shown in Fig. 1 is known as a typical example of a semiconductor laser having such a built in waveguide structure. Referring to Fig. 1, reference numeral 1 denotes a semiconductor substrate 2, a first clad layer 3, an active layer 4, a second clad layer 5, an ohmic contact layer 6, a current limiting insulating layer 7 and 8, electrodes and 9, a diffusion layer. The laser has a waveguide which is obtained by forming a projection rib 3a on the upper surface of the active layer 3 so as to change a refractive index. By changing a width W, a height H and a step difference H and compositions of the respective layers, a desired transverse mode can be obtained. However, a difference n between the refractive indices of the waveguide rib portion and the remaining portion is greatly increased in accordance with an increase in the step difference H. Therefore, in order to obtain the basic transverse mode, a strict manufacturing condition of, for example, H 50 nm is required T.P. Lee et al IEEE J. Quantum Electron. QE 11, 432 1975 . For this reason, it is difficult to manufacture the rib waveguide laser of this type. In order to solve the above problem, a semiconductor laser shown in Fig. 2 has recently been proposed by the present inventor wherein an optical waveguide layer 10 which has a refractive index smaller than that of an active layer 3 and greater than that of a clad layer 4 is formed in contact with the active layer 3, and a rib 10a is formed on the optical waveguide layer 10. Referring to Fig. 2, the remaining reference numerals are the same as those in Fig. 1. More particularly, reference numeral 1 denotes a semiconductor substrate 2, a first clad layer 5, an ohmic contact layer 6, an insulating layer 7 and 8, electrodes, respectively and 9, a diffusion layer. In this laser, the manufacturing condition becomes less strict such that H 0.2 µm, and the manufacturing method is simplified. This laser has advantages in that the basic transverse mode can be easily obtained, and that the beam irradiation angle becomes small to obtain a high optical output. However, in the laser of the type described above, when a material such as Aℓ In this case, since the rib 10a is buried in masking, the position of the rib 10a cannot be directly identified. Therefore, edges of the projection of the ohmic contact layer 5 which is formed in correspondence with the shape of the rib can be used as a reference for masking. However, when the second clad layer 4 and the ohmic contact layer 5 are formed by conventional liquid phase epitaxy LPE , a protrusion having wave like zigzag side edges of these layers 4 and 5 would be formed. This is considered to be due to local non uniformities in crystal growth rate of these layers when LPE method is employed. Once an optical waveguide layer 10 containing aluminum is exposed to air atmosphere during the aforementioned etching step, an oxide layer is readily formed on the surface of the optical waveguide layer. As a result, the second clad layer 4 cannot be appreciably grown on such an oxidized surface. Even if the second clad layer 4 is grown to some degree, the non uniformity of the second clad layer 4 becomes more conspicuous as compared with the case where aluminum is not included in the optical waveguide layer 10. Hence, masking for forming the current limiting region tends to become inaccurate, thereby deteriorating the performance and yield of the laser. In this sense, it was considered that the laser having the structure shown in Fig. 2 can be obtained when an InGaAsP semiconductor material which does not contain aluminum is used and the above laser cannot be obtained when a semiconductor material contains aluminum. The structure of Figure 2 is used as the precharacterising portion of claim 1 the method for its manufacture is used as the precharacterising portion of claim 7. It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a rib waveguide semiconductor laser device and a method for manufacturing the same, wherein masking for forming a current limiting region can be easily formed even if an optical waveguide layer contains aluminum. It is another object of the present invention to provide a rib waveguide semiconductor laser device wherein a III V group semiconductor material containing aluminum is used in accordance with the above method to control a laser oscillation wavelength to be short. According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a semiconductor laser device having at least a first clad layer of a III V semiconductor material, an active layer of a III V semiconductor material, an optical waveguide layer of a III V semiconductor material, and a second clad layer of a III V semiconductor material which are sequentially formed on one of an insulating substrate and a III V semiconductor substrate, and a stripe like projection is formed on said optical waveguide layer, said optical waveguide layer having a refractive index smaller than that of the active layer and greater than that of the second clad layer, characterized in that said optical waveguide layer contains aluminum among III group elements in a ratio Aℓ According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for manufacturing the semiconductor laser device of the invention, comprising the steps of forming a first clad layer of a III V semiconductor material and an active layer of a III V semiconductor material on an insulating substrate or a III V semiconductor substrate growing on the active layer an optical waveguide layer of a III V semiconductor material which contains aluminum as a constituent element and has a smaller refractive index than that of the active layer selectively etching the optical waveguide layer to form a stripe like projection thereon and forming a second clad layer of a III V semiconductor material on said optical waveguide layer, said second clad layer having a smaller refractive index than that of said optical waveguide layer by metal organic material chemical vapor deposition or molecular beam epitaxy on the optical waveguide layer. The present invention is based on the principle wherein the clad layer and the ohmic contact layer are formed by metal organic material chemical vapor deposition to be referred to as MOCVD hereinafter or molecular beam epitaxy to be referred to as MBE hereinafter on the optical waveguide layer comprising a III V semiconductor material which contains aluminum among III group elements in an atomic ratio of 0.1 generally 0.33 to 0.9 , so that the clad layer and the ohmic contact layer are easily formed to have linear edges corresponding to the shape of the rib of the optical waveguide layer, whereby the linear edges can be used as a reference masking for forming a current limiting region. According to the present invention, even if the optical waveguide layer containing aluminum as a constituent element is used, the rib waveguide semiconductor laser as shown in Fig. 2 can be manufactured thereby simplifying control of the transverse mode. Furthermore, since the semiconductor material containing aluminum is used, the laser oscillation wavelength can be short. The rib waveguide semiconductor laser of this type can be effectively used as a read light source of a video disk or a DAD digital audio disk which is recently receiving a great deal of attention. This invention can be more fully understood from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which A first embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to Figs. 3 A to 3 E . As shown in Fig. 3 A , an n type Aℓ A p type Aℓ As shown in Fig. 3 D , after depositing a SiO₂ Aℓ₂O₃ film 28 and a resist film 19 on the surface of the layer 26, the edges 26a of the ohmic contact layer 26 were used as a masking reference to align a mask 27 in position. Then, the whole surface was exposed to light and an unexposed portion of the resist film 19 which lies below the mask 27 was removed to expose the corresponding portion of the SiO₂ Aℓ₂O₃ insulating layer 28. After the exposed portion of the SiO₂ Aℓ₂O₃ film 28 was etched off, a Zn diffusion layer 20 was formed on the current limiting region of the ohmic contact layer 26 by using an Aℓ₂O₃ layer as a mask as shown in Fig. 3 E . Then, Cr Au electrodes 29 and 30 were formed, thereby preparing a semiconductor laser. A thickness L and an impurity concentration N of the substrate and each layer were preset in the following manner L 80 µm and N The thus obtained semiconductor laser has the stable basic transverse mode oscillation by means of the rib 24a formed on the optical waveguide layer 24. Furthermore, since the semiconductor material contains aluminum, the oscillation wavelength can be short. For these reasons, the semiconductor laser of this embodiment can be effectively used as a read light source of a video disk or a DAD. The rib is not formed on the active layer 23 but on the optical waveguide layer 24, so that the step height H of the rib 24a can be formed in a moderate condition H 0.2 µm , and its manufacturing method can be simplified. In addition, since the active layer 23 is not exposed, a crystal defect tends not to occur in the light emitting region. A second embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to Figs. 4 A to 4 D . The same reference numerals used in Figs. 3 A to 3 E denote the same parts in Figs. 4 A to 4 D , and a detailed description thereof will be omitted. The second embodiment mainly differs from the first embodiment wherein a diffusion layer is used in place of the SiO₂ film 28 to constitute a current limiting structure. In the same manner as in the first embodiment, a first clad layer 22, an active layer 23 and an optical waveguide layer 24 were formed on a substrate 21, as shown in Fig. 4 A . A p type GaAs Zn diffusion layer 31 which was doped with zinc of a high concentration p 1 x 10¹⁹ cm ³ was grown on the optical waveguide layer 24. Thereafter, the Zn diffusion layer 31 and the optical waveguide layer 24 were selectively etched to form a rib structure shown in Fig. 4 B . Subsequently, as shown in Fig. 4 C , an n type Aℓ The resultant structure was annealed at a temperature of 900 C to diffuse zinc from the Zn diffusion layer 31, thereby converting the third clad layer 32 on the rib to a p type layer. The impurity concentration of a Zn diffusion region 33 thus formed was N In the semiconductor laser thus obtained, the diffusion region 33 serves as a current limiting structure, so that the light emitting region of the active layer 23 can be defined in a stripe like manner. For this reason, the second embodiment has the same effect as in the first embodiment. In addition, the SiO₂ film as the current limiting structure need not be used, and the overall structure is simplified. Zinc tends to be diffused in the third clad layer 32 rather than in the optical waveguide layer 24 since the third clad layer 32 contains a greater amount of aluminum. Therefore, the diffusion layer 33 can be formed not to reach the active layer 23 but to reach the second clad layer 25. Fig. 5 shows a semiconductor laser according to a third embodiment. In this semiconductor laser, a first clad layer 22, an active layer 23 and an optical waveguide layer 24 are grown on a substrate 21 in the same manner as in the first embodiment. In the same state as in Fig. 3 B wherein a rib 24a is formed on the optical waveguide layer 24, oxygen is ion implanted in a region excluding the rib 24a to form an ion implantation layer 34. In this case, the ion implantation layer 34 must not reach the active layer 23. Thereafter, in the same manner as in the first embodiment, by using the MOCVD method, a second clad layer 25 and an ohmic contact layer 26 are grown, and electrodes 29 and 30 are formed to prepare the semiconductor laser. A crystal growth temperature in the MOCVD method is set to be 750 C or lower to prevent the ion implantation layer 34 from having a low resistance, thereby forming a high resistance layer for current limiting. A fourth embodiment will be described with reference to Figs. 6 A to 6 D . As shown in Fig. 6 A , a p type Aℓ In this semiconductor laser shown in Figs. 5 and 6 D , the ion implantation layer 34 or the Zn diffusion layer 45 serve as the current limiting region. Therefore, the third embodiment has the same effect as in the second embodiment. Fig. 7 shows a fifth embodiment of the present invention. This embodiment is a modification of the first embodiment. The fifth embodiment is substantially the same as the first embodiment except that part of the first clad layer 22 is etched through the active layer 23 when the optical waveguide layer 24 is selectively etched in the same state as in Fig. 3 B . By this construction, a current more easily flows in the optical waveguide layer 24. Any other construction of the fifth embodiment is substantially the same as that of the first embodiment, and a detailed description thereof will be omitted. The present invention is not limited to the above embodiments. For example, the material of the optical waveguide layer is not limited to an Aℓ
