# Method of air fuel ratio control of internal combustion engines of automobiles.

## Abstract
A method of air fuel ratio control for automotive internal combustion engine is disclosed, in which the amount of fuel to be supplied to the internal combustion engine is deter mined in accordance with the amount of air passing through a main air intake path 16 , and the amount of air in a bypass 32 is controlled in a manner to attain a predetermined air fuel ratio for a lean mixture gas which in turn is determined by a predetermined operating mode ϑ1 to ϑ2 of the automobile. The amount of supplied fuel which changes with the amount of air in the bypass is thus corrected to perform the lean mixture gas operation in the predetermined operating mode.
