# Streptomyces secretion vector.

## Abstract
A host Streptomyces cell engineered to produce and secrete a desired protein by the introduction of a DNA vehicle that does not occur naturally in the cell. The vehicle comprises 1 signal sequence encoding DNA derived from a Streptomyces endoH gene 2 a structural gene encoding the protein and 3 regulatory DNA that includes a promoter sequence positioned to be effective to begin transcription of a and b in the host cell, as well as DNA encoding a ribosome binding site. Methods of using the cell to produce the desired protein are also disclosed.
