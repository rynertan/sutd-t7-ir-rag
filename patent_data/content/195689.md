# A TAMPER RESISTING OUTLET FITTING FOR A CONTAINER

## Abstract
A tamper resistant fitting for a container, particularly but not essentially a beverage container, comprises a plastics insert 10 which is located coaxially around a part 9 forming a closure in the outlet 21 in the side wall 20 of a container. The insert has a top flanged portion 15 which in use lies beneath the top plate 1 of the closure with three equi radially spaced lugs 13 projecting from the top plate and provided for engagement with a tool through which rotational torque can be applied so as to engage the screw threading 12 on the insert with a complementary screw threading 25 on the outlet housing 21 . When the closure is fully tightened into the housing the lugs 13 are broken off, this then leaving only frictional engagement between the outer peripheral surface of the closure 9 and the inner peripheral surface of the insert 10 . The frictional coefficient between the two surfaces is arranged so that rotation will not occur with normal forces occurring in use, for example if a liquid extracting coupling device is connected with the top plate 1 , but the parts will rotate at an applied value of rotational force which is less than that necessary to unscrew the insert 10 from the housing 21 . In a further feature a thin plastics cap 25 is provided which incorporates fingers 29 which deform during en gagement with the housing 21 so that they lie beneath a protuberance 24 . When the closure is removed the fingers are deformed downwardly and break off from the cap thereby providing evidence of tampering.
