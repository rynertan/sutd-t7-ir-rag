# Torque limiting coil clutch ASA utilizing same.

## Abstract
An improved two way torque limiting coupling 10 of the type utilizing a helical coil clutch 18 is provided. The coupling provides a driving connection between a first 12 and a second 14 rotatable adjacent members. The first member includes a bore 24 opening to an end 20 in which one end of coil clutch is received in interference fit to define an internal clutch inter face 34 and the other member defines an annular outer periphery 26 about which the other end of the coil clutch is received in an interference fit to define an external clutch interface 36 . For the direction of rotation tending to expand the coil clutch 18 , the coupling will slip at the external inter face 36 which is the low maximum torque transfer direction of rotation for that interface and for the direction of rotation tending to contract the coil clutch 18 , the coupling will slip at the internal interface 34 which is the low maximum torque transfer direction of rotation for that interface.
