# Continuous polymerization process.

## Abstract
A process for polymerizing tetrafluoroethylene alone or with selected comonomers in an aqueous polymerization medium is rendered continuous by the use of a perfluoroal kyl ethane sulfonic acid or salt thereof or a perfluoroalkyl ethane sulfate salt as dispersing agent.
