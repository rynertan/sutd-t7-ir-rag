# SENSE AMPLIFIER

## Abstract
A sense amplifier 11 is coupled to a pair of bit lines 35, 36 for detecting and amplifying a voltage differential there between. The sense amplifier 10 has a first differential amplifier 18 coupled to the pair of bit lines 35, 36 enabled in response to a first signal. The sense amplifier also has a second differential amplifier 19 coupled to the pair of bit lines 35, 36 which is enabled a predetermined time duration following the occurrence of the first signal.
