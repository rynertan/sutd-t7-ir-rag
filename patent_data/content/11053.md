## Description
Method for obtaining a credit card having an anisotropic, uniaxial magnetization and credit card obtained therefrom.The invention relates to a method for obtaining a credit card having an anisotropic uniaxial magnetization and to a credit card which assures a considerable security degree against falsification so that it can be used as as credit means for the selective utilization of telephone sets, vendor slot machines, trolley bus, tramway, trains and for the super highway toll payment and as identifica tion means, e.g. for drawing money at a bank, in the bodies needing an entrance security control or presence signalling and anywhere it is requested the entrance and exit stamping of the personnel cards.Credit cards are well known based upon magnetic or optic effects in order to perform reliably the above mentioned tasks. However, they have many disadvantages due to the poor stability of the information codified on the card and the great easiness of reproducing the same. The credit cards on which the information is magnetically recorded are considerable unstable and unreliable since they can lose the recorded information if they are subjected to a strong temperature change or to dispersed magnetic fields or they casually come into contact with permanent magnets.Furthermore they easily can be reproduced once read the information recorded thereon with usual means. To this purposes it is sufficient to use an emulsified solution of iron powder and then to transfer the obtained information on a falsified card or like support by means of an usual magnetic recording apparatus. Also the optical effect credit cards such as those cards on which a cryptographic information is printed can be falsified as it is possible a duplication with the usual printing methods even if the cryptographic information is unknown.Furthermore they are subject to lose the peculiar optical properties because of wear during normal use.The object of the invention is to provide a credit card which eliminates the drawbacks of the conventional ones with a sure, reliable and unalterable identification means providing a security degree against falsification much greater than the known credit cards.According to the present invention it is provided a credit card, characterized by a substrate of non magnetic material for supporting the identification information, on any zones of which ferromagnetic material alloys are applied, said ferromagnetic material alloys having an uniaxial anisotropy of their hysteresis loop along two orthogonal axes lying on the substrate plane so that along one of said axes or preferential axis the hysteresis loop is rectangular, while along the second of said axes or resistant axis, perpendicular to the first one, the hysteresis loop is flat, i.e. with a minimum of energy.The invention is based on the particular characteristic that the hysteresis loop of some ferromagnetic materials such as the Fe Ni Co alloys have an uniaxial anisotropy.Accordingly it has been observed that certain alloys, if they are cooled at the presence of a magnetic fields, for example,starting from a temperature higher than the Curie point, maintain at room temperature a magnetic anisotropy with optimal magnetic properties in the direction along which the magnetic field has been applied.In order to better intend this phenomena it is useful to refer to the magnetism theory and to the existence in each ferromagnetic material of that considerably high molecular magnetic field which makes the material spontaneously magnetized at the saturation in the absence of any external applied magnetic field, even if the material appears completely demagnetized to the obserx It is assumed in fact that each ferromagnetic material is divided in many little zones or dominions, each of them is magnetized at the saturation in a predetermined direction, that is bound to the crystal structure of the material. Particularly in the iron, which has a crystal lattice formed by a body centered cube, this direction coincides with the cube corners.Therefore, these directions in the absence of an external applied magnetic field are different an distributed at random in the various dominions, whereby the material appears technically demagnetized to the observer since the outward effect of the multiple directions of dominion orientation is null.By applying now a magnetic field to the material, a determined magnetization according to the field direction appears therein since the various dominions modify thir preferential magnetization directions as a single dipole and are aligned in the field direction.Particularly if the material as above mentioned is cooled at the presence of a magnetic field starting from a temperature higher than the Curie point, the dominions which are formed during the material cooling remain aligned in a preferential direction coinciding with that along which the magnetic field has been applied. Along this preferential direction anisotropic properties and rectangular hysteresis loops are obtained, while in a direction perpendicular thereto there are flat hysteresis loops, i.e. with minimal or almost null energy.The present invention starts from this property of the ferromaS1etic materials and provides a credit card consisting of a substrate or support of non magnetic material and partic ularly of plastic or paper material upon which a thin layer of a ferromagnetic material composed of a Fe Ni Co alloy is fixed e.g. by electrodeposition methods or evaporation of the alloy under hard vacuum. During the deposition a magnetic field tangential to the support plane is applied so as to obtain along this direction the desired uniaxial anisotropic properties.Particularly if this deposition of ferromagnetic material occurs as per zones throughout the substrate, each of such zones will constitute a credit unit or bit available for the codification of the credit card.In fact, a binary digit 0 or 1 according to the direction of the applied magnetic field, i.e. according to the sign of the hysteresis loop magnetization intensity, can be associated to the hysteresis loop of each zone that is detected along the direction or preferential axis along which the magnetic field has been applied. The number of such zones is varying as well as it can be varied the directions of the applied magnetic fields in an orthogonal cartesian axis system lying on the substrate plane.During the identification process, the sensing of the binary digits will be performed by means of suitable sensing devices that will carry out the scanning of the credit card surface along orthogonal directions and will detect in one case a magnetization intensity with a certain positive or negative value, to which a logic 1 or 0 respectively will be associated, and in the other case an almost null hysteresis.As a result, the falsification of the credit card according to the present invention is very difficult by theusual readout and recording means since the material appears practically demagnetized thereto.Furthermore, in order to increase the falsification difficulties, according to another aspect of the present invention, the ferromagnetic material is deposited on the credit card support in layers of differentfflickness so as to obtain as higher magnetization intensities as greater is the thickness of the layer under the same conditions. Therefore, during the identification process a threshold comparator, that accepts the signals if only these have a predetermined intensity, can be provided along with the sensing device scanning the credit card surface.An advantage with respect to the magnetized credit card is that the readout of the anisotropic effect credit card is static, i.e. the credit card doesn t needany movement during the readout, which gives rise to easiness of readout means design.Another advantage is the low price since the substrate can be composed of plastic or paper material and the single bit zones or memory cells can be continuosly obtained in a single step process.Finally, the bit zones or memory cells of deposited ferromagnetic material can be phiically destroyed or removed by punching or piercing them or by varying locally the physical characteristics of the deposited material.Thus it can be provided a credit card wth scaled or diminishing value depending on the enjoyed service and the low price of this credit card with respect to its face value allows the suppression thereof when the credit is exhausted.The present invention will be now described more in detail with reference to the annexed drawings, wherein Fig.1 is a support substrate of the ferromagnetic material with a cartesian tern of reference axes Figure 2 is an anisotropic hysteresis loop sensed in the direction parallel to that of the applied magnetic field Fig.3 is an anisotropic hysteresis loop, sensed in a direction perpendicular to that of the applied magnetic field Fig. 4 is a support substrate on any zones of which the ferromagnetic material has been deposited, and Fig. 5 is a support substrate on which the ferromagnetic material has been deposited evenly.In Fig.1 it has been indicated with 1 a substrate of non magnetic material that forms the credit card support, on which a thin layer 2 of varying thickness consisting of a Fe Ni Co iloy is deposited, for example, by means of electro deposition methods or evaporation of the alloy under hard vacuum.During the deposition a magnetic field tangential to the plane of the support 1 is applied, for example, in the direction of the X axis of the associated cartesian tern. This axis as above mentioned will be as a result the preferential axis along which good magnetic properties with rectangular hysteresis loops can be obtained, as shown in Fig. 2. On the contrary along the Y axis, referred to resistant axis, flat hysteresis loops with a minimum of energy will be obtained, as shown in Fig.3. It is evident that the magnetic field can be applied in the direction of Y axis so that the latter becomes the preferential axis and the X axis becomes the resistant one.If, for example, as shown in Fig.4, a series of zones are deposited according to the same continuous methods, each of them will be an available code unit or bit due to the hysteresis loop along the preferential axis. The number of these zones as well as of the code units or bits is varying depending on the application to which the credit card is designed.Thus, if the binary digit O and 1 are associated with the two magnetization states, i.e. direct Bs and reverse Bs of the hysteresisioop along the preferential axis in Fig.2, a binary code of identification associated to the bit zones or memory cells available on the credit card can be read by means of a scanning device or sensor.According to another aspect of the present invention the identification can be performed by sensing only the physic presence of the memory cells on the credit card by means of a detection of the two hysteresis loops ofFigures 2 and 3 with a scanning along two orthogonal axes. Thus the code is established during the construction of the credit card by varying the position and the number of the memory cells on the credit card substrate.Another embodiment of the present invention relates to the deposition of the memory cells so as to form preferential magnetization axes oriented with slgles varying from cell to cell in the substrate plane, due to the variation of the direction of the magnetic field applied to each cell. The angular differeiice between preferential axes of continuous cells allows the combination of very large series of codes. According to another embodiment of the present invention the ferromagnetic material 6 is evenly deposited on the substrate Fig. . In this case, the single memory cells or information bits can be distributed in predetermined zones of the substrate thus forming thereon preferential magnetization axes 7 during the deposition of the ferromagnetic material.Finally, in case of a fractional application of the ferromagnetic material upon the substrate, it is to be intended that the form of the various memory cells can be as different as possible i.e. foil, plate or thin wire of any shape and dimensions depending on the particular scope of application.
