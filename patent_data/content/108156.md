## Description
IMPROVED METHOD FOR THE PREPARATION OF NON CRYSTALLINE POLYMERS OF HIGH MOLECULAR WEIGHT This invention relates to a method for preparing a high molecular weight non crystalline polymers suitable for use as a drag reducing substances. More specifically, this invention relates to an improved method for preparing such materials by slurrying a transition metal catalyst in a hydrocarbon diluent with an ether activator, placing the slurry in the presence of a co catalyst such as an organoaluminum compound or organo aluminum halide, and contacting the material with one or moreoQ monoolefinic hydrocarbons containing from 2 to 30 carbon atoms under suitable polymerization conditions, then ceasing the polymerization at a polymer content of 20 percent by weight or less. It is well known thatOC olefins may be polymerized in the presence of catalysts generally referred to as ZieglerNatta catalysts. These catalysts generally consist of materials such as a transition metal halide such as titanium trihalide and organometallic co catalysts such as aluminum alkyls or aluminum alkyl halides. Much work has been done on modifying Ziegler Natta catalysts to improve polymerization rates with development of more efficient catalysts or promoters for the production of highly crystalline polypropylene and poly butene l .These efforts usually have been two fold to maximize catalyst activity and to control polymer stereoespecifictr. Among the numerous organic additives proposed for the preparation of polypropylene and poly butene l are those disclosed in U.S Patent 3,476,730, hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety into the instant specification. A number of ether modified Ziegler Natta systems have been proposed as catalysts. A propylene polymerization catalyst was taught in U.S. Patent 3,116,274, which consisted of an aluminum alkyl, a titanium halide, such as titanium tetrachloride, and an ether compound. This reference recommends the use of a halogen free alkyl as for the propylene polymerization process and cyclic ether, such as 1,4 dioxane as suitable catalyst promoters. U S. Patent 3,206,533 prepared synthetic lubricants by the polymerization of olefins containing from 6 to 14 carbon atoms in the presence of aluminum alkyl sesquichloride, titanium tetrachioride, and an oxygen containing organic component, such as an oxirane or methyl alkyl ether, at temperatures of from O to SOOC. U.S. Patent 3,156,681 revealed an improved process for the polymerization of olefins using an unsaturated ether compound as a catalyst promoter. Suitable unsaturated ethers were taught to be vinyl ethers, with the preferred material being vinyl isobutyl ether. U.S. Patent 3,318,859 discloses a process for the stereospecific polymerization of propylene using a catalyst prepared from monoalkyl aluminum halide, violet titanium trichloride and an ether of the formula R1OR2, where R1 represents alkyl or aralkyl, andR2 is an alkylaryl, aralkyl, or alkylaryl radical. This reference deals with the preparation of isotactic highly crystalline polypropylene. However, none of these references whether taken alone or in any combination teach or suggest a method for obtaining an ultrahigh molecular weight polymer which is non crystalline and has properties suitable for use as a drag reducing material. The references discussed are representative but not exhaustive of the art The present invention also relates to anti mist agents fuel efficiency agents, lubricant components and tackifiers The process of the present invention produces polymer especially well suitable for fluids being transported through pipelines, and for a method of producing such materials. In the art discussed, the thrust of attempts was to further increase polymerization activity, stereoregularity, and crystallinity by the introdx ior of catalyst modifiers.These systems all produced highly crystalline, high molecular weight polyO olefins such as polypropylene or poly butene l . The highly crystalline polymers. resulting from such processes, are the result of the orderly arrangement of the pendant substituents along the polymers chain backbone. These stereoregular, crystalline polymers have excellent physical and mechanical properties, are suitable to form molded objects which exhibit stiffness.For example, these materials can be injection molded and extruded in the forms of objects such as pipe or tubing which require rigidity. One drawback, of the high molecular weight and the ultrahigh molecular weight polymers which are crystalline, are their processing difficulties, In contrast to these objectives of the prior art, the present invention relates to polymerization of at least oneOC monoolefin containing from about 2 to about 30 carbon atoms to produce ultrahigh molecular weight, non crystalline polymers. These polymers as such are not suitable to form molded objects which exhibit stiffness.In addition, these materials are not suited for molding and the like and cannot be extruded in a form which requires rigidity Thus, the general purpose of the present invention is to provide an improved method for the preparation of ultrahigh molecular weight, non crystalline polymers, co polymers, and terpolymers, which are hydrocarbon soluble. Ethylene and propylene, are operable and included in the definition ofCi olefins for the purposes of the present invention. U.S. Patent 3,692,676 reveals a method of reducing friction loss or drag for pwmpable fluids through pipelines by adding a minor amount of a very high molecular weight polymer. This reference shows that generally from about 5 to about 50 parts per million ppm of a polyO olefin in the pumpable fluid provides drag reduction, and defined percent drag reduction for oil being passed through a pipeline as Pressure Drop of 8 DR Pressure Drop of Oil Polymer Solution x 1QO Pressure Drop of Oil This patent is hereby incorporated in the instant specification in its entirety. However, the preparation of the ultrahigh molecular weight, non crystalline materials of the present invention encounters several problems, one of which is the extremely long reaction time necessary in order to obtain a useable product. In order to obtain the ultrahigh molecular weight, non crystalline and hydrocarbon soluble polymers, it is nedessary that the polymerization be conducted at low temperatures resulting in long batch times and low catalytic actipities. It would, therefore, be of great benefit to provide a process which has fast reaction time while providing the high molecular weight, non crystalline materials of the present invention. We have now discovered a method for preparing non crystalline, high molecular weight, drag reducing polymers which comprises a preparing a transition metal catalyst slurry containing 1 at least 5 percent by weight based on the total slurry weight of a crystalline titanium halide having the general formula TiXn where n 2.5 to 3.0 and X is halogen 2 a hydrocarbon inert diluent and 3 from about .01 to about 10,0 moles of an ether per mole of titanium together with b a co catalyst such as an aluminum alkyl and or an organo aluminum halide materialF wherein a and b are placed in contact with c one or moreCQ monoolefinic hydrocarbons containing from 2 to 30 carbon atoms under polymerization conditions of from about 250C to about 100 C and atmospheric to about 1000 pounds per square inch gauge pressure to obtain an ultrahigh molecular weight polymer, soluble in a hydrocarbon diluent. Preferably, the polymerization should be ceased at a polymer content of 20 percent by weight or less based on total reactor content. It is normally preferred that the polymerization be completed or terminated at 20 weight percent or less polymer content, based on total reactor content in order to obtain the ultrahigh molecular weight, non crystalline hydrocarbon soluble material0 The resulting mixtuxe will then contain less than 20 weight percent of the ultrahigh molecular weight polyolefin, a hydrocarbon solvent or unreacted olefins , deactivated catalyst, and optionally a small amount of alcohol. The entire mixture can then be used as a drag reducing substance. However, the polymer may be precipitated by a variety of techniques if desiredThese techniques are well known to those skilled in this art. In addition, materials can be added to prevent deterioratior of the mixture or corrosion of its environment.For example, materials such as epoxides propylene oxide or compounds containing at least one oxirane unit primary, secondary, and tertiary amines such as triethylamine, tributylamine, trioctylamine polyamines natural amino acids and Group I A and 1I A metal hydroxide bases. If polymerization is allowed to continue to higher levels, the average molecular weight will rapidly decrease making the materials less desirable for use as drag reducing materials Therefore, it is preferred in the practice of the present invention to cease polymerization at polymer content level ranging from about 5 to about 20 weight percent, again based on total reactor content. However, polymer content levels of from 5 to 1S weight percent are preferred and polymer content levels of from about 8 to about 11 percent are most preferred, all based on the total reactor mixture. In addition, as the weight percent polymer content increases, the bulk viscosity of the mixture increases and it becomes difficult to pump these drag reducing materials. The catalyst slurry of the present invention comprises a crystalline titanium halide material, a hydrocarbon diluent, and a complexing ether agent. Preferably, the catalyst is titanium trichloride, which is aluminum reduced and activated. Examples of such materials are sold by theStauffer Chemical Company as TiCl3.AA Type 1.1 aluminum reduced and activated, having the formula TiC13.1 3 tAlC13 . However, crystalline violet titanium trichloride and titanium catalysts of the formula TiCl3.rtiAlCl3Cm O to 1.0 can generally be used. The second component of the catalyst slurry is a hydrocarbon diluent. These materials are inactive hydrocarbon solvents with respect to the polymerization. Examples of such materials are straight chain aliphatic compounds or branched hydrocarbons such as ethane, propane, butane, pentane, hexane, heptane or octane. Also suitable are alicyclic hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane, methyl cyclopentane and tetralin. In addition, aromatic hydrocarbons can be used such as benzene, toluene, and xylene. Of course, mixtures and analogues of these compounds can be used such as Molex trademark of Universal Oil Products raffinate which is a complex mixture of branched aliphatic, cyclic aliphatic, aromatic, and trace amounts 2 38 of unbranched aliphatic hydrocarbons.The hydrocarbon diluent can also be anD olefin, The titanium comp lex and ether agent is a very important component of the catalyst slurryt The ethers are selected from alkyl ethers wherein ether oxygen is attached directly to 2 aliphatic groups and may have aromatic sub . stituents aryl ethers wherein the ether oxygen is attached directly to two aromatic groups aryl alkyl ethers wherein the ether oxygen is attached directly to one aliphatic and one aromatic group and cyclic ethers wherein the ether oxygen is an integral part of a ring structure Thus, the ether can contain alkyl, aryl, aryl alkyl or aryl alkyl group, each containing from 1 to 30 carbon atoms, and cycloalkyl ethers containing from 2 to 30 carbon atoms. Representative, but non exhaustive examples of alkyl ethers are benzyl ether, n butyl ether, tert butyl methyl ether, di n butyl ether, isopropyl ether, and di npropyl ether. Representative examples of cyclic ethers are cyclododecane epoxide, cyclohexane oxide, cyclooctene oxide, cyclopentene oxide, dibenzofuran, dihydropyran, furan, 2 methylfuran, 5 methylfuran, 2 methyl tetrahydrofuran, 3 methyl tetrahydrofuran, styrene oxide and tetrahydrofuran.Representative examples of aryl ethers are m phenoxytoluene and phenyl ether. Representative examples of aryl alkyl ethers are anisole, butyl phenyl ether, m dimethyloxybenzene, dimethoxybenzene, 2, dimethoxytoluene, l methoxynaphthalene and 2 methoxynaphthalene. The reaction is normally carried out under an inert atmosphere such as dry nitrogen or dry argon to prevent degradation of the titanium and aluminum alkyl components.The slurry system of the present invention has a number of processing advantages as well as providing an ultrahigh molecular weight, non crystalliner hydrocarbon soluble, drag reducing polymer. Initially, the system provides a high safety factor, since titanium trichloride is a flammable solid which decomposes readily by moisture and oxygen to titanium dioxide and hydrogen chloride. The fumes are hazardous, and the catalyst can ignite. The slurry system of the present invention makes such materials easier to handle, deliver, and meter into the reactor as compared to the solid catalyst. The slurry limits the catalyst exposure to air and moisture. In addition, the slurry system of the present invention provides uniform distribution of catalyst throughout the reactor, reduces the amount of catalyst agglomeration in the preparation of such highly viscous materials and reduces the product s corrosivity on steel and metal surfaces.These catalyst components are normally highly corrosive, and when agglomerated result in a very corrosive environment. The ether component of the instant invention activates the titanium catalyst and generates a more effective drag reducer. However, the addition of ether in contact with the titanium component for long periods of time, results in catalyst deactivation and or retardation of product molecular weight. The simple addition of the ether component into the reactor provides improvement. However, the addition of the ether to the titanium component prior to insertion into the reactor according to the present invention further improves activity and performance. In a preferred embodiment set forth in Figure 1, the titanium component of the present invention is mixed with a hydrocarbon diluent and agitated. This material is then sent to a metering zone wherein materials are passed to a catalyst activation zone where they are contacted with ether and activated.This contact time will generally range up to about 10 minutes, but in any case must be sufficient to activate the titanium material. It is imperative that this activation be carried out under an inert atmosphere and with sufficient agitation to ensure activation. The catalyst activation zone is normally large enough to contain catalyst for several batches. In a more general embodiment the titanium catalyst and ether activator are simply mixed batch wise for each polymerization carried out. The ether activated titanium component is then charged into a polymerization zone wherein it is contacted with organoaluminum co catalysts, olefin, and an optional inert hydrocarbon diluent Under these conditions a very rapid reaction occurs which reduces catalyst agglomeration and which provides a very high molecular weight, non crystalline hydrocarbon soluble, drag reducing polymer. Figure 1 is a general description of a preferred embodiment of a catalyst slurry activation system. Specifically described, Figure 1 shows the preparation of a catalyst slurry containing crystalline titanium halide in a relatively inert hydrocarbon diluent selected from the group consisting of aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, aromatic hydrocarbons their halogen derisrat tens and mixtures thereof in zone 1 entitled Catalyst Slurry The slurry contains from about 5 to about 95 percent by weightTiXn in hydrocarbons. The mixture its stored under inert atmosphere such as dry nitrogen or dry argon to prevent degradation of the TiXn component. While maintaining a slurry of the titanium component and diluent, a portion of the slurry can be passed through a Metering Zone which places the titanium and the inert hydrocarbon diluent into a Catalyst Activation Zone in a measured amount. In the Catalyst Activation Zone , the titanium component is treated with an ether activating agent.The mole ratio of the ether activating agent to mole of titanium can range from about .01 to about 10.0 moles, respectively. It is necessary to agitate the ether and titanium components prior to polymerization. During thins period the catalyst is activated chemically and or physically prior to polymerization. Contact time for the catalyst in the activation zone need only be that sufficient for activation of the titanium component and generally ranges from about 1 to about 10 minutes, with from 1 to about 5 minutes being preferred. The preferred slurry concentration in the CatalystActivation Zone ranges from about 10 to about 50 by weight of titanium component in diluent. The preferred mole ratio of ether to titanium is from 0.4 to 0.7 moles. After activation, the activated catalyst is discharged in its entirety into the reaction zone. Preferably, the reactor already contains.the polymerizable olefin and the co catalyst. Optionally, a diluent may be present. The polymerization is initiated by the simple introduction of the activated catalyst slurry containing the titanium and ether. It is preferred to contract the co catalyst in the reactor in the presence of olefin rather than prior to introduction into the polymerization zone, since it has been surprisingly found that this feature provides superior activity and performance for the catalyst as compared combination prior to introduction. Co catalysts useful in the present invention are aluminum alkyl compounds or alkyl aluminum halide compounds.Representative examples of such materials are trimethylaluminum, triethylaluminum, tri n propylaluminum, tri n butylaluminum, triisobutylaluminum, tri n hexylaluminum, tri 2 methylpentyl aluminum, tri n octylaluminum, diethylaluminum hydride, diisobutylaluminum hydride, di isopropylaluminum chloride, dimethylaluminum chloride, diethylaluminum chloride diethyl aluminum bromide, diethylaluminum iodide, di n propylaluminum chloride, di n butylaluminum chloride, dlisobutylaluminum, chloride, or mixtures of these. The present invention is depicted and exemplified as a batch reaction. However, those skilled in this art will readily recognize that the slurry system described is extremely well suited for continuous polymerizations. In such a continuo. polymerization system, the titanium catalyst would be continuously contacted with and activated by an ether in an activation vessel. The activation vessel would be maintained at a constant volume while a stream of the activated titanium ether catalyst slurry is passed to the polymerization zone. Japan Xokai 75156586 discloses a method of polymerizing propylene wherein an ether activating agent is added to an organoaluminum compound and olefin prior to inserting titanium. German Offenlegungsschrift 2810544 describes a method wherein titanium trichloride and an organoaluminum compound are treated with an alkylaluminum dihalide.in butyl ether Japan Kokai 78129195 shows the presence of aluminum containing compounds with titanium during the activation with ethers However, these processes are not that described in the present invention. U.S. Patent 3,055,878 teaches the use of tertiary amiries in preforming a catalyst by reacting said amines with a titanium trichloride. This amine activated titaniummaterial is then added to an olefin and thereafter an organoaluminum material is added. However, this reference indicates the necessary time of the reaction or activation between the amine compound and the titanium compound is at least one hour and the process produces a crystalline product, not the non crystalline hydrocarbon soluble materials of the present invention. The present invention is more completely described with reference to the examples below wherein all parts are by millimoles unless otherwise specified. The examples are provided to illustrate the present invention and not to limit it.General Procedure In examples 1 through 5 the same general procedure was followed.

The substance was washed with an additional 400 ml of isopropanol, filtered, and washed with 400 ml of methanol to remove catalyst residue. The poly octene l was collected by vacuum filtration and dried in a vacuum oven overnight.Comparative Example 2 The general procedure was followed except that 0.56 millimole of di n butyl ether per millimole of titanium was added.

Example 4 A 30 weight percent slurry of TiCl3.AA inMolex raffinate was prepared as described in comparativeExample No. 3. However, the di n butyl ether was not added to the DEAC. The ether was added to the slurry containing TlC13.AA in Molex raffinate. The mole ratio of ether to tita niuinwas 0.56 as was in Examples 2 and 3.

In this test, diesel oil was continuously circulated from a 5 gallon storage tank through a Moyno progressive cavity pump to a 5 foot test section of 3 8 inch stainless steel precision tubing then returned to the 5gallon tank. The storage tank was maintained at a constant temperature of 740F and continuously stirred at low speed. The test fluid flows through a 1 foot calming section followed by a 4 root test section where the pressure drop is measured. The pressure drop differences were measured, and the percent drag reduction DR calculated by the equation DR Pbase Padditive x 100 Pbase where Pbase is the initial baseline pressure of diesel oil without the additive andAPaitive is the pressure drop with the polymer solution. The inherent viscosity set forth in Table 1 was determined for each polymer produced in LPA low polynuclear aromatic solvent at 77.5.5 F. A Cannon Ubbelohde four bulb shear dilution viscometer was used to make the determination. The inherent viscosities were calculated. at a shear rate of 300 reciprocal seconds 300 sec In the table, inherent viscosity or logrithmic viscosity number is defined as inh n s c where is the viscosity of the solution s is the viscosity of pure solvent, and c S is the concentration of the solution. Example 6 A 30 weight percent slurry of TiCl3.AA in Molex raffinate was prepared which contained 9.04 millimoles of ether per millimole of titanium. The catalyst mixture was agitated then delivered to the polymerization reactor. The reactor contained inert hydrocarbon solvent Molex raffinate and DEAC. The mixture was stirred, and 12.5 weight percent octene l was added to initiate the polymerization. The mote ratio of polymerization components was 1368 13.4 9.04 1.0 milliinole octene aluminum ether titanium . The resulting catalytic activity at 200 10C was 41.7 grams poly octene l produced per gram of titanium used per hour. The resulting polymer had an inherent viscosity of 9.9 dl gm at 300 reciprocal seconds. Examples 7 10 In the following examples the mole ratio of ether was varied from 1.13 to 4.52 millimoles per millimole of titanium. In these experiments a 30 weight percent slurry of TiC13.AA in Molex raffinate was prepared, and the ether was added. Polymerizations were charged with 12.6 octene l.Ether was added to the slurry before delivering the slurry to the polymerization zone. The ratio of polymerization components other than ether in each experiment was 1368 13.4 1.0 millimole octene DEAC titanium . Pertinent results and data on the effect of the ether variations are presented inTable 2.

To this mixture was added 1.7 mmoles of di n butyl ether per mmole of titanium. The slurry was agitated for 15 to 45 minutes prior to the introduction of the slurry into the polymerization zone. InExample 12 the slurry was prepared and stirred for 24 hours prior to introduction into the polymerization zone. In this example, the catalyst mixture formed a thick gum prior to introduction. It was difficult to deliver to the reactor zone and results indicated that catalytic retardation took place. The olefin used in each experiment was octene l at 12.6 wt. The mmole ratio of catalytic components was 1200 11 1.7 1.0 mmole octene aluminum ether titanium . The results demonstrate that long contact times of the ether component with a transition metal catalyst. are detrimental.The catalyst particle size appeared to be reduced to á state that resulted in catalytic retardation.

Contact time can vary substantially, but normally will range from about a few minutes to about 60 minutes. At high concentrations of ether to titanium, that is, above about an equal molar basis, these materials should be left in contact longer than about 60 minutes when using intense agitation. When these precautions are observed, the process of the present invention provides a vastly improved process of obtaining an ultrahigh molecular weight, non crystalline, hydrocarbon soluble, drag reducing polymer. While certain embodiments and details have been shown for the purpose of illustrating this invention, it will be apparent to those skilled in this art that various changes and modifications may be made herein without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention.
