# Hog feeder.

## Abstract
A feeder 25 for livestock and the like is disclosed. The feeder has a feed receiver body 31 for receiving and storing a flow of feed from a conveyor. As shown in FIGS. 2, 3 and 4, a drop tube means 51 extends from the feed conveyor into the feed receiver body 31 , and includes at least one wall 65 mounted for vertical motion relative to a fixed wall 55,57 . When the movable wall is in a raised position, that movable wall 65 and the fixed wall 55,57 define a verti cally oriented opening 64 through which feed can pass from the drop tube 51 into the receiver body 31 . By adjust ing the position of the movable wall 65 , the amount of feed collected in the receiver 25 can be correspondingly changed. When a stopper valve member 40 is drawn away from a discharge opening 44 , the feed pile collected in the receiver body 31 is discharged from the receiver 25 for livestock consumption. A stopper actuator 47 includes a flexible member 49 connected to the stopper valve 40 , and a rotatable wind up device 48 connected to the flexible member 49 . When the wind up device 48 is rotated, the flexible member 49 is wound up and draws the stopper valve 40 away from the discharge opening 44 .
