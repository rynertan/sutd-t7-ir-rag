# Method and apparatus for applying torque to a rotating structure and use of said method and apparatus.

## Abstract
An exciter for applying a dynamic torsional force to a rotating structure, such as to the shaft of a turbine generator, the axle of a vehicle, or the like, during mechanical testing to determine the mechanical response characteristics, natural modes of vibration, fatigue life, etc., of the structure. The exciter 20 preferably includes a rotary hydraulic actuator 21 having a housing 22 secured to the structure 10, 11, 12 to be tested and a driveshaft which is rotatable relative to the housing 22 as well as an inertial mass 30 mounted on the driveshaft. The exciter 20 also includes a hydraulic power supply 58 for the actuator 21 and an electrohydraulic means comprising a torque setpoint circuit 59 for producing a torque command signal to set the desired amplitude and frequency of oscillation of the inertial mass 30 , a position setpoint circuit 72 for producing a position command signal to set the mid point of the arc through which the inertial mass 30 oscillates, means for producing a torque feedback signal dependent on the actual dynamic torsional force produced by the oscillating inertial mass 30 , means for producing a position feedback signal dependent on the average angular position of the inertial mass 30 relative to the structure 10, 11, 12 as the inertial mass 30 oscillates and a controller 68 responsive to the command and feedback signals for energizing a servovalve 55 that controls the supply of pressurized fluid to the actuator 21 . The actuator 21 oscillates the inertial mass 30 relative to the structure 10, 11, 12 to be tested in order to produce a controlled dynamic torsional force on the rotating structure 10, 11, 12 .
