# Method and apparatus for selectively copying images.

## Abstract
An apparatus for selectively copying only certain por tions of an image, such as portions of documents containing printed or graphic matter, and eliminating gaps between selected portions thereby to minimize time and memory capacity for storing, transmitting or reproducing the selected portions. A document 24 to be selectively copied is scanned by an optoelectronic scanner 26 which generates an electronic signal representative of the image. The signal is stored in a random access memory RAM 44 for read out at a later time. A microprocessor 12 controls operation of the scanner and addressing of the data in the RAM. The data stored in the RAM may be read out sequentially without gaps between the selected portions of the document. The data read out from the RAM may be sent to a high speed printer, a facsimile machine, or other transducer for printing, transmis sion to a remote location, or display.
