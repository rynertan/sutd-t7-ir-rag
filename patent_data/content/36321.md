## Description
CERAMIC FILTER The present invention relates to a ceramic filter for removing fine particles contained in gases, and more particularly to a ceramic honeycomb filter which has excellent heat resistance and thermal shock resistance, is small in size and has a very large filter area. Enown filters include ones wherein various fillers, such as adsorbing material, steel wools, ceramic fibres, and porous porcelains, are arranged.However, in filters aiming at removing fine particles, unless filters having fine meshes are used, the removing efficiency cannot be improved but on the contrary a disadvantageous increase of the pressure drop results when a high filtration rate is required, As means for enlarging the filter area in the prior sheet formed, plate formed or cylindrical filters, there are used relatively simple structures, such as corrugated structures and double cylindrical forms,However, a notable increase of the filter area per unit volume has not been attained. Therefore, in order to avoid a high pressure drop, the filter volume has been made larger and it has been very difficult to obtain a filter of small size. Various processes for producing ceramic honeycomb structural bodies are known and include, for example, a paper dipping process wherein an organic porous sheet is impregnated with a ceramic slurry and a honeycomb body is formed and the formed body is fired, a pipe binding process wherein a large number of pipes of given shape are bound, an extrusion process wherein a raw batch material is extruded through a die provided with a large number of given shaped slits, and a press process. The method for producing a ceramic honeycomb structural body will now be explained in more detail with respect to an extrusion process. To fine powder of a ceramic raw material, such as alumina, silica, mullite, silicon carbide, silicon nitride and or cordierite, are added an organic binder and a plasticizer, the mixture is kneaded to prepare a composition consisting mainly of ceramic raw material, this composition is extruded through a die provided with a large number of slits, which forms a monolithic structure having channels of given shape in cross section, for example polygonal such as triangular, tetragonal or hexagonal, circular or oval, and the shaped structure is dried and fired to obtain a porous ceramic honeycomb body. Honeycomb structural bodies have been recently used as catalyst supports for purifying exhaust gases of automobiles, and as heat exchangers for gas turbines.As mentioned above, a large number of parallel channels of given shape extending therethrough are uniformly distributed, so that the pressure drop of the gas flow is very small and the surface area per unit volume is large and the channels are constructed of thin walls, so that such a body can be easily heated up. However, in such ceramic honeycomb bodies, the large number of channels defined by the thin partition walls have been limited to the function of passages for flowing gas, The present invention provides a ceramic filter comprising a honeycomb structural body having parallel longitudinally extending channels defined by gas permeable porous ceramic thin walls, wherein one end face of some channels of the honeycomb body is sealed with a sealing material and the other end face of the remaining channels is also sealed with a sealing material. In a honeycomb filter body according to the invention, the thickness thereof can be far thinner than that of a conventional ceramic filter and the available area of the filter can be structurally enlarged, and even if a filter material having a fine structure is used in order to remove fine particles, the pressure drop is not increased and a compact structure can be obtained. The invention will be further described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings, whereinFigure 1 is an end view of a previously known honey comb structural body Figure 2 is a partially cut away side view of the honeycomb structural body shown in Figure 1 Figure 3 is an end view of one embodiment of a honey comb structural body comprising a filter according to the present invention Figure 4 is an end view of another embodiment of a honeycomb structural body comprising a filter according to the present invention Figure 5 is a partially cut away side view of the honeycomb structural body shown in Figure 4 Figure 6 is an enlarged fragmentary view of a part of the honeycomb structural body of Figure 5 and Figures 7 11 are end views of other embodiments of honeycomb structural bodies comprising filters according to the present invention. Figures 1 and 2 show a conventional honeycomb structural body in which the cross sectional shape of a large number of parallel channels 2 extending therethrough is tetragonal and each channel is defined by very thin partition walls 1. Figure 3 shows one embodiment of a honeycomb structural body wherein one end surface of the channels of the honeycomb body is sealed in a checker pattern, and Figures 4 and 5 show an embodiment of a honeycomb structural body wherein one end surface of the channels is sealed in alternate rows, Thus, the thin porous partition walls forming the channels are used as a filter by sealing one end of the channels in the honeycomb structural body. When sealing the channels, a suitable mask is used and the sealing material may be any suitable material which can tightly seal the channels, such as a resin or sealing glass, but when good heat resistance and thermal shock resistance are necessary it is desirable to use the same ceramic material as that forming the ceramic honeycomb body.The pattern of sealing the channels is not limited to the checker pattern shown in Figure 3 and the alternate row pattern shown in Figure 4 other sealing patterns include a spiral pattern Figure 7 , a concentric tetragonal pattern Figure 8 , a stepped pattern Figure 9 and a cross pattern Figure 10 o The shape of the channels may be other than tetragonal, for example another polygonal shape such as triangular or hexagonal, or circular or oval. Circular channels are shown inFigure 11. The ceramic honeycomb body has, for example, a wall thickness of 0.10 1.0 mm, more preferably 0.15 0.80 mm, a channel number of 25 600 inch2, more preferably 50 300 inch2, and a porosity of 30 60 . The filter preferably has a diameter of 50 300 mm and a length of 50 400 mm and the shape of the filter may be other than a circular column, for example an oval column or a polygonal column. The filter size in the radial direction may be optionally enlarged by bonding several filters. A further explanation will now be made with respect to the effect of the filter according to the present invention. Figure 6 is an enlarged fragmentary view of a part of the honeycomb structural body shown in Figure 5. This filter is set so that the direction of the channels is parallel to the flow of dustcontaining gas and the gas flow passes into the filter through an opening portion 2a of a gas inlet end face and passes through thin porous ceramic partition walls la and Ib having communicating pores, because the other end face of the respective channel is sealed with a sealing material 3, and the gas flow transfers to the adjacent channels which open at the gas outlet side and is discharged. Thus, the thin porous partition walls having communicating pores function as a filter and the entrained fine particles in the gas are filtered. Since the filter has a honeycomb structure the available area of the filter per unit volume is noticeably increased, and since the thickness of the partition walls is very thin the pressure drop is relatively low even when a high filtration rate is required, and the structure can be compact, By controlling the pore distribution and porosity of the porous material, fine particles of various sizes can be filtered. Furthermore, the structure may be composed of a porous ceramic material having excellent heat resistance and thermal shock resistance, so that the filter can be used at high temperatures and is very stable to sudden temperature variation. Therefore, the filter clogged with fine particles can be exposed to a fairly high temperature, so that the fine particles can be removed by burning, whereby the filter function can be recovered.Accordingly, the filter is very effective for removing fine carbon dust from exhaust gases ofDiesel engines and other internal combustion engines at high temperatures. If possible, the filter may be coated with a catalyst and the clogged fine particles burnt at a low temperature to recover the filter function0 The invention will now be further described with reference to the following illustrative Examples,EXAMPLE 1 By using a cordierite honeycomb having a diameter of 120 mm, a length of 120 mm, a thickness of the partition walls of the channels of 0.30 mm and a number of channels per square inch of about 200, a honeycomb filter wherein both ends are sealed in checker pattern as shown in Figure 3 was prepared, The material for sealing the channels was the same as that forming the honeycomb structural body, and after moulding the honeycomb body the channels were sealed and then fired. The obtained cordierite honeycomb had a porosity of 43 and an average pore diameter of 10 pmO The pressure drop of this sample was measured by using air at room temperature, and the pressure drop was 50 mmR20 at a flow rate of 2 m3 minO The filter area was about 12,700 cm For comparison, a cylindrical ceramic filter having the same diameter and length as the above described honeycomb structural body, one end of the cylinder being sealed, was prepared and the pressure drop of this filter was measured. The wall thickness of the ceramic filter was 3 mm, which is thin as production permits. The material forming the filter was cordierite, the porosity was 45 , the average pore diameter was 20 jim and the filter area was about 770 cm2.The pressure loss measured by using air at room temperature was 1,800 mums20 at a flow rate of 2 m3 min, i.e. the pressure drop was about 35 times as high as the previously described honeycomb filter, and the filter area was far smaller than the previously described honeycomb filter EXAMPLE 2 By using a mullite honeycomb having a diameter of 140 mm, a length of 150 mm, a thickness of the partition walls of the channels of 0.30 mm and a number of channels per square inch of about 200, a honeycomb filter wherein both ends are sealed as shown in Figure 4 was prepared. The material for sealing the channels was the same as that forming the honeycomb structural body, and after moulding and firing the honeycomb body the channels were sealed and again fired. The obtained mullite honeycomb had a porosity of 41 and an average pore diameter of 14 yiii. The pressure drop of the sample was measured by using air at room temperature, and the pressure drop was 40 mmR20 at a flow rate of 2 m3 min. The filter area was about 11,000 cm2. EEAMPIE 3 A honeycomb filter was prepared by sealing channels of a honeycomb having a diameter of 120 mm, a length of 150 mm, a thickness of the partition walls of the channels of 0.43 mm and a number of channels per square inch of about 100, with the same material as that forming the honeycomb structural body in a checker pattern as shown in Figure 3. The pressure drop of the filter was found to be 80 mmR20 by using air at room temperature at a flow rate of 2 2 mien . When exhaust gas of a Diesel engine was passed through this filter to collect 7 g of fine carbon particles, the pressure drop measured by using air at room temperature was 800 n1InR20 at a flow rate of 7 2 2 m3 min. It has been generally known that fine carbon particles in the exhaust gas of a Diesel engine are burnt at a temperature of 550 650 C, but for the purpose of determining the heat resistance of the filter wherein carbon has collected the filter was put in an electric furnace and treated at 1,20000 for 30 minutes, As a result, the filter was not at all damaged and the fine carbon particles were burnt, and the pressure drop measured by using air at room temperature was 80 mmH20 at a flow rate of 2 m3 min whereby it was confirmed that the filter function had been recovered,
