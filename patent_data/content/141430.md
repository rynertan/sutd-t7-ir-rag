# ADJUSTABLE FRICTION SASH HOLDER

## Abstract
A holder 10 for a sash 11 running in a resin jamb liner 12 applies adjustable friction to a track 20 in the sash plow region of the sash run of the jamb liner. Track 20 has parallel edge guides 21 that are L shaped in cross section to project from the sash run and extend toward each other. Holder 10 includes a carriage 25 that fits within the plow 19 of sash 11, and carriage 25 has a pair of runners 27 and 28 whose lateral edges are trapped under guides 21 to confine the runners to vertical movement along the track. Carriage 25 also has a friction shoe 35 variably pressed against the sash run surface of the track by an adjustment screw 15. Balance spring 13 pulls upward on carriage 25 and platform 26, connected to carriage 25 by adjustment screws 15, straddles plow 19 and supports the lower corner of sash 11. Screw 15 adjusts the friction of holder 10 within the sash run by the pressure it applies to friction shoe 35.
