## Description
The invention herein relates to cutting tools. More particularly it relates to improved ceramic cutting tools. Metal cutting or machining is recognized to be one of the most important and most widely used processes in manufacturing. Among the common machining operations are shaping, planing, milling, facing, broaching, grinding, sawing, turning, boring, drilling and reaming. Some of these processes, such as sawing, operate on both the external and internal surfaces of the workpiece, while others operate only on the internal e.g. reaming or external e.g. milling surfaces of the workpiece. These various processes are described in detail in DeGarmo, The measure of productivity of a given machining operation is determined by the total amount of metal removed from the workpiece in a given period of time. To this end a wide variety of materials have been used or suggested as cutting tools. These are commonly classified as tool steels, high speed steels, cast non ferrous alloys, sintered carbides and ceramics. There are also some limited applications for diamonds . The commonly measured parameters of cutting tool performance are cutting speed, depth of cut, feed rate and tool life. Each of these prior art cutting tool materials is deficient in one or more of these parameters. Tool steel, high speed steel and cast non ferrous alloys all have critical temperature limita tions which restrict their cutting speed to relatively low rates, as measured in feet per minute fpm or meters per minute m min . Typically high speed steels are restricted to 100 225 fpm 30 70 m min for cutting steel and 250 300 fpm 75 90 m min for cutting non ferrous materials. The cast non ferrous alloys will operate at up to about twice those rates. The carbide materials, such as tungsten carbide, improve on the cutting speed rates of the steels by a factor of 2 5, particularly when the carbides are coated. However, the carbides are not as tough as the steels and are susceptible to impact breakage. This severely limits their usage to applications where impact is a factor, such as in making interrupted cuts or in machin ing hard workpieces. Ceramic materials, such as alumina, have been found to produce cutting tools which can operate at much higher speeds than the conventional steel and carbide cutting tools. For instance, cutting speeds of 500 1400 fpm 150 430 m min for steel cutting have been reported. Tool life with the ceramics, however, has been a serious problem, because the ceramics are even more brittle and less tough than the carbides. Of particular concern has been the tendency of the ceramic materials to fracture catastrophically and unexpectedly when subjected to impact. Thus, while cutting speeds have been high for the ceramic materials, it has been possible to operate them only at quite low feed rates, much lower than those used for the steels and carbide cutting tools. It has thus been found that productivity, which is a function of both cutting speed and feed rate, is relatively low for all prior art types of cutting tools. The steel and carbide tools, while having high feed rates, have relatively low cutting speeds. Conversely, the ceramics, while having high cutting speeds, operate only at low feed rates. Productivity, determined as total amount of metal removal for a given time period, therefore remains relatively low regardless of the type of cutting tool used. References relating to the use of various ceramics as cutting tools include U.S. Patent 4,543,343 to Iyori et al which describes use of a ceramic comprised of alumina, zirconia and titanium carbide together with titanium boride. Another reference is U.S. Patent 4,366,254 which describes a cutting tool ceramic comprised of alumina and zirconia together with carbides, nitrides or carbo nitrides of Group IVB and VB metals. There have been some teachings that silicon carbide fiber reinforced ceramics can be used in various machine parts. Examples shown have included heat exchangers, molds, nozzles, turbines, valves and gears see Japanese patents nos. 59 54680 and 59 102681. Such disclo sures, however, are not particularly pertinent to the cutting tool invention described herein, since such parts are not subject to impact stresses as part of their normal service environment. No mention is made of improved toughness or impact resistance nor are such properties of interest in the articles described. It has also been disclosed that fracture tough ness in ceramics can be improved by incorporation of silicon carbide whiskers into the ceramics. Two papers by Becher and Wei have described mechanisms for increase in toughness as related to whisker content and orientation see Toughening Behavior is SiC Whisker Reinforced Alumina , The invention herein, in its broadest form, is a cutting tool composed of a composite comprising a ceramic matrix having distributed therethrough reinforcement comprising ceramic whiskers. In a preferred embodiment the ceramic matrix comprises alumina, either pure or with inclusions of modifying materials. Alternative ceramic matrices include those of silicon nitride, which may also include modifying components. Most preferred of the reinforcing ceramic whiskers are those of silicon carbide. Other whiskers which may be suitable will include alumina, aluminum nitride, beryllia, boron carbide, graphite and silicon nitride. In any given tool the whisker reinforcement must of course be of a material which is compatible with the ceramic matrix and with which it forms adequate reinforce ment bonding. The whisker content in the ceramic matrix is 2 to 40 volume percent whiskers. A formulation comprised of 25 volume percent silicon carbide whiskers in alumina matrix has been found to be a particularly outstanding ceramic cutting tool. Figures 1 and 2 graphically compare face milling results obtained with cutting tools of the invention with those obtained with conventional cutting tools. Cutting tools represent a unique and highly specialized class of industrial articles. Cutting tool geometry is such that intense cutting stresses are localized and concentrated at the cutting edge of the tool. The work required to deform the workpiece and generate the chip, as well as the friction between the chip and the face of the cutting tool, causes considerable heat to be gener ated in the cutting tool. The properties of the workpiece, such as its ductility or hardness, can further intensify the stresses and operating temperatures to which the cutting tool is subject. A cutting tool is also subject to varying degrees of impact, particularly when making intermittent cuts, but also depending on whether the work piece tends to form continuous or discontinuous chips. A detailed discussion of these types of service conditions, as well as a description of the various tool geometries, is found in the aforementioned DeGarmo reference. Thus the critical and unique combination of operating stress, temperature and impact makes the determination of materials suitable for use as cutting tools significantly different from the determination of materials for other industrial articles such as heat exchangers or gears. The present invention is based upon the discovery that incorporation of a defined content of ceramic rein forcing whiskers in a ceramic matrix yields a cutting tool structure that not only retains the high cutting speeds of prior art unreinforced ceramics but unexpectedly also permits ceramics to operate at the high speed feed rates previously obtainable only with the steels and carbides, and even with the latter only at the cost of greatly reduced cutting speed. The ceramics which can form the matrix body of the cutting tool are any of the ceramic materials which have previously been found useful as cutting tools in the unreinforced condition. The most important of these is alumina. Alumina may be used either alone i.e. containing no other materials except recognized impurities or it may be combined or doped with minor amounts i.e. less than about 30 of toughening components such as zirconia, yttria, hafnia, magnesia, silicon nitride and titanium carbide or mixtures thereof. The Becher et al SAE paper cited above shows typical compositions containing up to 30 volume percent zirconia, with the zirconia incorporating up to 3 mole percent yttria. Other ceramics which can serve as cutting tool matrices include silicon nitride, which may also include modifying components. The reinforcing whiskers most advantageously used are silicon carbide whiskers. Both the alpha and beta forms of silicon carbide whiskers are available commer cially and can be employed. The whiskers used in this invention have a single crystal or monocrystalline structure. A particularly preferred commercial source is those silicon carbide whiskers produced and marketed by the Advanced Materials group of ARCO Chemical Company. Such whiskers are produced from rice hulls and typically have average diameters on the order 0.6 µm and aspect ratios on the order of 15 150. Strengths are typically on the order of 1 million psi 70,000 kg cm² and tensile moduli on the order of 60 100 million psi 4 7 million kg cm² . The silicon carbide whiskers are thermally stable to 3200 F 1760 C . Other whiskers which may be suitable will include alumina, aluminum nitride, beryllia, boron carbide, graphite and silicon nitride. Mixtures of whiskers may also be used. For an additional description of single crystal whiskers see Katz, H.S. and Milewski, J.V., Short fiber materials of the polycrystalline type are to be distinguished from the single crystal whiskers used in this invention. The polycrystalline filaments or chopped fibers are much larger in diameter e.g., 10 microns or larger. As taught in the Wei patent referred to above, the polycrystalline fibers suffer considerable degradation due to grain growth at temperatures above about 1250 C which severely limited their use in high temperature fabrication processes such as hotpressing for producing ceramic composites of nearly theoretical density. Further, during high pressure loadings such as encountered during hot pressing, the poly crystalline fibers undergo fragmentation which detracts from the reinforcing proper ties of the fibers in the ceramic composite. Also, these polycrystalline fibers provided insufficient resistance to cracking of the ceramic composite since the fibers extending across the crack line or fracture plane possess insufficient tensile strength to inhibit crack growth through the composite especially after the composite has been fabricated by being exposed to elevated pressures and temperatures in hot pressing. Also see Milewski, J.V. Short Fiber Reinforcements Where The Action Is , It will be recognized that the ceramic whiskers must be of a composition compatible with the ceramic matrix composition. Since most of these materials are suffic iently compatible with each other, it should pose no problem to those skilled in the art to avoid the few instances where there may be incompatible combinations. It will also be understood that the whiskers must be bound in the matrix in a manner so as to produce rein forcement of the matrix. The particular nature of bonding reinforcement is imperfectly known. However, the general considerations for good reinforcement have been described by a number of investigators. One concise description is found in Katz et al, The preferred ranges of whisker content will depend on the type of cutting services for which the tool is designed. Lower contents about 2 12 are generally better when the tool is to be used for types of cutting e.g. turning where the cutting force is applied rela tively continuously and heat builds up in the tool matrix. Where the ceramic force is applied in a more interrupted or intermittent manner, however, the higher contents e.g. 20 35 are more preferred. A cutting tool comprised of about 25 volume percent silicon carbide whiskers in alumina matrix provides especially outstanding performance. It will be recognized that there may be a certain amount of routine experimentation required to determine the optimum content for a given end use however, such should be easily performed by one skilled in the art. Typical examples of tools of this invention are illustrated in Table I. The data in Table I were derived from an experiment in which fracture toughness K Similar increases in toughness can be expected for other ceramic matrices. For instance, ceramic matrices composed of silicon nitride or alumina doped with titanium carbide both have fracture toughness on the order of 1.5 times greater than the fracture toughness of alumina matrices. It is anticipated that the same degree of fracture toughness improvement with whisker reinforcement as shown for alumina in Table I would also apply to the silicon nitride and alumina titanium carbide matrices. The ceramic cutting tools of this invention are formed by first blending the proper proportions of the ceramic matrix material in powdered form with the ceramic whiskers. A wide variety of sytems are known for mixing of particulate solids. Typical are those described in Perry et al, Once the ceramic matrix material and the ceramic whiskers are thoroughly blended, the formation of the composite cutting tools then proceeds in the same manner as formation of conventional unreinforced ceramic tools. Typically the tools are formed by molding under pressures of 3,000 60,000 psi 200 4200 kg cm² and either simultane ously or subsequently sintered at temperatures on the order of 1500 3200 F 800 1750 C . The particular shape molded will of course depend on the intended function of the cutting tool. The improved ceramic tools of this invention have a high degree of toughness and wear resistance. In especially preferred practice, the cutting tools are replaceable inserts of the standard geometry employed in the cutting industry for such varied cutting tool and cutting tool insert applications as turning, facing, milling, boring, and the like. Machining processes employing the cutting tools of this invention are generally described in Practical Machining Principles for Shop Application by Metcut Research Associates, Inc. 1981 3980 Rosslyn Drive, Cincinnati, Ohio 45209 incorporated herein by reference. The markedly improved products of this invention are illustrated in Table 2 below. In these examples various types of ceramic cutting tools were used for slab mill cutting of cast iron at a rate of 2,000 surface feet minute 600 surface meters minute using 0.040 inch 1.0 mm depth of cut. The tool life indicates the number of inches of metal cut before the tool failed by breakage. It will be immediately evident that the rein forced tool provided more than an order of magnitude improvement in tool life, which leads to greatly increased productivity, even though the test with the reinforced tool was terminated short of tool failure. While some steel and carbide cutting tools can provide long tool lives, none of them can operate at the high cutting speeds that the ceramics can. On the other hand, the data of Table 2 clearly show that the unreinforced ceramics, while opera ting at the high cutting speed, have unacceptably short tool lives. The reinforced cutting tools of the present invention, however, clearly combine the best properties of both types of prior art tools without the deficiencies of either one. In further illustration of the invention, cutting tool inserts comprised of alumina matrix containing varying amounts of silicon carbide whiskers were prepared and tested in face milling tests. For comparison conventional inserts were also prepared and tested. The inserts of the invention were formed by thoroughly blending finely powdered alumina with the appropriate quantity of the silicon carbide whiskers used in the preceding example and hot pressing the blend at 280 kg cm² and 1850 C and 1 hour to form an insert blank having a theoretical density in excess of 99 . The blanks were finished ground to form SNG 432 shape ceramic cutting inserts. The face milling tests were performed on a Cincinnati No. 5 vertical milling machine. This machine was equipped with a 40 horsepower D.C. variable speed drive motor for the spindle and a 10 horsepower A.C. variable speed drive motor for the table feed. The work material was Class 30 gray cast iron. The configuration of the turning workpiece was 12 inch O.D. by 8 inch I.D. by 13 inch long. These tubes had a hardness of 179 BHN. The bars used for the single tooth milling test were 2 inches by 4 inches by 12 inches. The surface scale was removed from all test workpieces before any tests were performed. All the tools, except tool insert A had an edge preparation of 0.006 inch by 30 . Tool insert A edge preparation was 0.006 inch by 20 . The tests with all tools were stopped when the wear on the side cutting edge was 0.010 inch uniform wear, 0.020 inch localized wear, or tool failure. Conditions of milling were as follows Cutting Speeds 2000 and 6000 feet minute Feeds 0.040, 0.080, and 0.100 inch tooth Depth of cut 0.050 inch Width of Cut 4.0 inches Setup On center Cutting Fluid Dry Work Material Class 30 Gray Cast Iron, 179 BHN Tool Material SNG 432 inserts Geometry Axial Rake 5 End Cutting Edge Angle 15 Radial Rake 5 Radial Relief 5 Corner Angle 15 Nose Radius 0.030 inch Radial Depth of Cut 4.0 inches Axial Depth of Cut 0.050 inch Setup On center Cutting Fluid Dry Tool Life End Point 0.010 inch uniform wear 0.020 inch localized wear tool failure The results of the single tool face milling tests are presented in Table 3 and in Figures 1 and 2. These tests are designed to evaluate the toughness of the cutting tools. The cutting speed was set at a constant 2000 feet minute. The initial chip load was 0.040 inch tooth. The depth of cut and width of cut were 0.050 inch and 4.0 inches, respectively. At this set of conditions, the Si₃N₄ 30 TiC, the Si₃N₄ alumina and the aluminum 30 TiC inserts broke after 44, 42, and 27 inches of work travel. All the other tools were tested until a minimum of 108 inches of work travel was achieved without breakage. The chip load was then increased to 0.080 inch tooth, and the remaining five tools were tested. The results are presented in Figure 1. The 25 SiC whisker insert of the invention had 336 inches of work travel without breaking. An additional test was performed to verify this result. The second test was stopped at 119 inches of work travel without breaking. This tool was then tested at a chip load of 0.100 inch tooth. At this chip load, it was tested for 204 inches of work travel before the test was stopped without breaking. All other tools broke at the 0.080 inch tooth chip load. These tools were also tested at 6000 feet minute and 0.005 adn 0.010 inch tooth feeds. The results of these tests are presented in Table 3 and as tool life versus feed curves in Figure 2. The superiority of the cutting tools of this invention over comparable commercial tools is apparent. A Commercial Si₃N₄ Alumina insert B Commercial Si₃N₄ 30 TiC insert C Commercial Si₃N₄ insert D Commercial alumina 30 TiC insert To further demonstrate the advantages achieved with the cutting tools of this invention as compared with conventional cutting, additional runs were made, the results of which are presented below. In the following, the 25 SiC insert was a 25 volume silicon carbide whisker in alumina matrix material prepared by the procedure given in the preceding example. Insert E was a conventional alumina 4 zirconia insert, and insert G was a conventional Si₃N₄ insert with added A1N, A1₂0₃ and Y₂0₃ sintering aids. The inserts are compared in a number of different cutting applications. Work material Cast iron Meehanite GC, Hardness 185 HV Insert style SNGN 120416T Tool life criterion 1 mm maximum flank wear or premature fracture Feed 0.2 mm rev Depth of cut 2 mm Speed 700 m min and 450 m min R Edge life ranking S Edge life scatter Maximum minimum lifetime in of mean life time The 25 SiC whisker reinforced alumina insert of the invention showed increased lifetime and reduced lifetime scatter compared to a alumina ceramic E and silicon nitride ceramic G in this intermittent cutting operation. Work material Nodular cast iron SS 0737 00, Hardness 270 HB Insert style SNGN 120416T Tool life criterion Bulk fracture Feed 0.38 mm rev Depth of cut 3 mm Speed 500 m min The insert of the invention was a tougher material than insert G in intermittent cutting of cast iron. In this test the work material is designed to exert very strong intermittent forces and thermal cycling of the tool tip. Alumina ceramics are less tough than silicon nitride ceramics. Thus, the SiC whisker reinforced ceramic is strengthened to a toughness behavior superior to silicon nitride while retaining the wear resistance of alumina. Work material Hardened steel SS 2310, Hardness 64 HRC Insert style SNGN 120461T Tool life criterion Fracture Feed 0.23 mm rev Depth of cut 0.5 mm Speed 60 m min The SiC whisker reinforced insert of the invention performed better than insert G in continuous turning of hardened steel. Work material Inconel 718, Solution treated and aged Insert style SNGN 120412E Tool life criterion Flank wear and or rake face flaking The SiC whisker reinforced insert performed better than insert G and had a high degree of security and wear resistance. Work material Incoloy 901 Solution treated and aged Insert style SNGN 120412E Tool life criterion Flank wear and or rake face flaking The SiC whisker reinforced insert was suitable for the turning of Incoloy 901 and had a slightly better edge life than G. A great advantage is that the lack of trailing edge notch wear consistently maintains a good surface finish. The industrial applicability of the present invention lies in the field of metal cutting. The cutting tools of the present invention can be used in virtually any industrial field in which metal cutting is a factor. Typical of the industries in which these cutting tools would be advantageous are the automotive, aircraft, structural metals and general metal working industries. It will be evident that there is a wide variety of embodiments of the present invention which are not specifically described above but which are clearly within the scope and spirit of the present invention. The above description is therefore intended to be exemplary only and the scope of the invention is to be limited solely by the appended claims.
