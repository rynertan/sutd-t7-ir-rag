# PARTICLE CLASSIFIER

## Abstract
A particle classifier has a uniform, laminar, classifying air stream and a duct to introduce particulate material generally perpendicular to the air stream. The particulate material is entrained in a secondary air stream that is diverted as it enters the classifying air stream by a curved surface. The curved surface produces and diverts the air stream by the Coanda effect to minimise disturbance to the classifying air and segregate the particles from the secon dary air.
