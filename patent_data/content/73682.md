# Electroacoustical transducer for use in a vibratory environment and a method of making same.

## Abstract
A capacitance type electrostatic transducer is pro vided that can be operated in an environment where it may be subjected to excessive mechanical vibrations. Unwanted gain variations and or spurious electrical sig nals are precluded, at reduced cost, by mechanically attaching the electrically conductive transducer spring 32 that urges the backplate 24 into cooperative en gagement with the vibratile diaphragm of the transducer, to the transducer backplate 24 . A cylindrical boss 30 on a flat upper surface of the backplate engages a wedge shaped hole 36 in the spring as the spring is inserted during assembly arrow .
