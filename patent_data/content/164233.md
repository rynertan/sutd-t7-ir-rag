The mill includes feed means 24 for supplying a generally planar strip of metal 26 and em bossing means 28 for forming the high and low portions on the surface of the strip to be formed into the outside surface of the tube. The mill also includes breakdown means 32 for se quentially transversely bending the strip from its planar condi tion. The breakdown means includes roller means 44, 46, 48 having a gripping surface for engaging the strip and having al ternating high and low portions shaped to mate with those of the strip.
