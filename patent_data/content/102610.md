# Apparatus and method for the treatment of organic wastes.

## Abstract
Apparatus for the anaerobic conversion of organic waste to biogas using a microbial biomass comprises a closed reactor 1 adapted to receive the organic waste, the reactor having a first chamber 4 and a second chamber 3 in liquid communication, a gas blower 13 for conveying biogas which accumulates in the second chamber 3 to the first chamber 4 with a corresponding displacement of liquid material from the first chamber 4 to the second chamber 3 , and a quick release valve 14 for rapidly equalising gas pressure in the chambers with a concomitant rapid reverse displacement of liquid material at predetermined intervals, resulting in an oscillating flow of liquid material in the reactor and an intimate mixing of the organic waste and the biomass, and a gas outlet 17 for releasing biogas from either of the chambers.
