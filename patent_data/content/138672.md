# METHOD OF MAKING A PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARD

## Abstract
The invention is a method for providing an electrically con ductive path through a substrate. It is especially useful for elec trically connecting together electrically conductive paths 25 on opposite sides of a circuit board 20 . The method is charac terized by the steps of forming a passage 21 through a sub strate 20 that connects to at least one conductive path 25 on each side of the substrate 20 , filling the passage 21 with an electrically conductive powder 10 , applying pressure with a die 30 to obtain a compacted powder 11 in the passage 21 , and then heating the compacted powder 11 to a tem perature that increases the conductivity and ductility of the compacted powder 11 and its adhesion to the substrate 20 without adversely affecting the shape or condition of the sub strate 20 .
