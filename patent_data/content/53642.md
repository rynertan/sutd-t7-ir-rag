## Abstract
Surfaces 3, 4 and 3A, 4A of the inner and outer frame elements 1,2 which when assembled form a box section member. The gaps are converted into respective mould cavities for resin by the pressure of shoes 9,10 against the elements 1,2 adjacent the respective gaps to close one side thereof, the shoes 9,10 being removed only after the resin has cured to leave the finished thermal break 6,6A . The shoes 9,10 are carried on opposite walls of a laterally expansible tube 8 which is inserted into the box section and is expanded to press non stick surfaces 13 of the shoes 9,10 against the respective gaps ready for the moulding and curing of resin therein, whilst maintaining the gap dimen sions. After curing of the resin, the tube 8 is contracted laterally to disengage the shoes 9,10 and is then withdrawn to leave the finished thermal break 6,6A .

## Description
METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR FORMING A T iER tAL BREAK BETWEEN TWO ELONGATEELEMENTS OF A METAL FRAME This invent ion relates to methods and apparatus for forming a thermal break between two elongate elements of a metal frame such as a metal window or door frame. Metal extruslons, particularly aluminium extrusions, are widely used in the construction of door and or window frames, because of the advantages afforded by the strength, ease of maintenance etc., of the finished construction. However, the thermal properties of the metal tend to result in the formation of condensation when one part of the frame is subjected to lower temperatures than are experienced by another part of the frame, e.g. by the side of a door frame exposed to the exterior of a building which tends to be colder than the inner side exposed to the building interior.To combat this, 2 thermal break is provided between the two parts of the frame, being in the form of a layer of thermal barrier material, usually a rigid resin, which collects the two parts of the frame so that. there is no direct metal to metnl contact between them. One widely used method of constructing a thermal break is illustrated in Figures 1 and 2 of the accompanying drawings, and involves the use of a one piece aluminium extrusion which comprises the outer element 1 of the frame and the inner element 2 of the frame, the elements 1 and 2 having respective confronting surfaces 3 and 4 which are spaced apart by a thin web 5 which at this,stage connects the elements 1 and 2.. In other words, there is formed between the elements 1 and 2 a shaped channel of which the walls are defined by the confronting surfaces 3 and 4, and the web 5.The shaped channel is then filled with a resin material, and when this has cili d and thus rigidlfied, the base of the channel constituted by the web 5 is removed by amachining operation to leave the construction shown in Figure 2 where the resin material 6 constitutes the sole connection between the paris 1 and 2c Conveniently the surfaces 3 and 4 are undercut as shown at 7, to provide a secure connection between the resin material 6 and the elements 1 and 2. Although the method described above is suitable to produce a construction such as that shown in Figure 2, there is a need for a box like construction such as that shown in Figure 3 of the accompanying drawings, her the elements 1 and 2 are connected by a thermal break comprising two parallel strips of resin 6 and 64 disposed in opposite side walls, of a box like section.Frequently this box like construction is required in lengths of up to 5 metres, and it will be readily appreciated therefore that if the method described with referenceto Figures 1 and 2 is applied to the box like construction, the appearance of the construction after the formation of the thermal breaks 6 and 6A would be as is shown in Figure 4 of the accompanying drawings, requiring a difficult if not impossible nachining operation to remove the unwanted webs 5 and 5A inside the box section0 The object of the present invention is to provide a method of forming a thermal break which does not require the subsequent removal of unwanted metal webs, and apparatus for performing this method, which is therefore particularly suitable for the production of the box like construction shown in Figure 3 of the accompanying drawings. According to one aspect of the present irrerltion, there is provided a method of forming a thermal break between two elongate elements of a metal frame, comprising the steps of assembling said two elements so that two parallel, laterally spaced elongate surfaces on one of the elements respectively confront two corresponding parallel, laterally spaced elongate surfaces on the other element to define therebetween two parallel elongate gaps of predetermined dimensions, the assembled elements forming a box section elongate member with said elongate gaps disposed in opposite elongate side walls thereof closing off one open elongate side of each of the gaps to form a respective elongate mould cavity by disposing within the box section member a pair of elongate shoes which are each aligned with the inner open elongate side of a respective one of said elongate gaps, and moving the shoes simultaneously apart in an outward lateral direction thereby to press each shoe into engagement with said elements adjacent the respective gap to form said respective mould cavity filling the mould cavities thus formed with a thermal barrier material to join the parallel elongate surfaces rigidly together with thermal barrier material between them and disengaging said shoes from said elements by moving the shoes relatively laterally towards each other before withdrawing them from the box section member. For convenience, before their insertion in the box section member, the shoes are preferably mounted on opposite exterior sides of an elongate tube, the tube being expansible, in a single lateral direction such that when the tube and the shoes are disposed within the boxsection member with the shoes aligned with said gaps as aforesaid, lateral expansion of the tube in said single lateral direction presses the shoes against said elements to close off said inner open sides of the gaps, lateral contraction of the tube serving to disengage, said shoes from said elements. The expansion of the tube and its contraction. may be accomplished in any suitable manner, for example. using pneumatic or hydraulic pressure operated means for example, an elongate flexible bag may be disposed inside the tube, means being provided for varying the pressure inside the bag as required. An embodiment of the invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, of which Figures 1 and 2 show various stages in the construction of a thermal break according to a known method, as described hereinabove Figure 3 shows a cross sectional ve of 2 typical box section meander incorporating a thermal break Figure 4 shows anintermediate stage in the construction of a box section member such as that shown in Figure 3, using a similar method to that used in Figures 1 and 2 Figure 5 shows an embodiment of apparatus according to the invention at an intermediate stage during the construction of a box section member incorporating a thermal break such as that shown in Figure 3 Figure 6 shows Sa perzpective view of the expansible tube and pressure bag used an the apparatus shots in Figure 5, ,Figure 7 of the drawings shows an alternative construction of expansible tube Figure 8 of the accompanying drawings shows a modified pair of sections to be assembled with the thermal break therebetween and Figure 9 is a t Blown up view of part of one of the sections sh in Figure 8. It should be noted that throughout the Figures of the drawings, like parts are indicated by like reference numerals, for easy identification. The known method of forming thermal break comprising a single strip of resin material, as shown in Figures 1 and 2, has already been described herein, as well as the difficulties in adapting this method in producing a thermal break in a box section member requiring two closely spaced parallel strips of resin material, as shown in Figure 3. Considering Figures 5 and 5, according to a preferred embodiment of the, present invention, an elongate box section member is formed by assembling two independent metal extrusions, here shown as elements 1 and 2, alongside one anoth2r, with respective pairs of confronting surfaces 3,4 and 3A,4A defining respective elongate gaps between the elements 1 and 2, the gaps beige located in the side walls of the box section member. Fach surface 3, 3A, 4 and 4A is preferably undercut as before as shown at 7. he An expansible tube 8 is inserted between the elements 1 and 2, so that respective shaped shoes 9 and 10 carried on opposite sides of the tube 8 are aligned with the inner open sides of the gaps between the pairs of surfaces 3,4 and 3A,4A. The tube is constructed from two elongate channel members 11 and 12, which are nested together in the manner Illustrated in Figures 5 and 6, to form the tube which is open at both ends, and which is expansible in one lateral direction only by relative lateral sliding movement of channel member 11 into and out of channel member 12. The shoes 9,10 are mounted on the sides of the tube formed by he base walls of the respective channel members 12 and 11.It will be seen that with this construction of the tube 8, the exterior dimension of the tube in a lateral direction perpendicular to the direction of the relative sliding movement between the channel members 11 and 12 remains substantially constant during expansion and contraction of thetube, so that the tube 8 can be used to maintain the desired gap width once it is inserted within the box section member. Once the tube is inserted in the box section member with the shoes aligned as illustrated inFigure 5. the tube is expanded in a manner described in detail below, to o press the shoes into engagement with the elements 1 and 2 adjacent the inner sides of the respective gaps, so that each shoe closes off one side of the respective gap, and converts it into, a mould cavity into which the thermal barrier resin material can be injected. Because the resin is introduced into the mould cavities as a fluid i.e. in uncured condition , the elements 1, 2 are first arranged so that one of the mould cavities is uppermost, and the resin is poured into this mould cavity.After a few minutes, when the resin has hardened sufficiently, the elements 1,2 are turned over so that the other mould cavity can be filled with resin also. The resin 6, 6A in each mould cavity is allowed to set i.e. cure, after which the shoes are retracted from the elements, 1, 2 by contraction of the tube 8, after which the tube 8 and the shoes 9, 10 are removed from the now completed box section. Preferably the surfaces 13 of the shoes 9, 10 which engage the elements 1 and 2 and which constitute the respective mould cavities are hollow, each surface having a flat base with very shallow inclined side walls rising therefrom. The surfaces of the elements l and 2 which the inclined side walls engage are correspondingly under cut to facilitate the correct relative locations of the elements 1 and 2 during filling and curing of the resin 6, 6A within the mould cavities. o To facilitate the read removal of the shoes 9,iO from the cured resin material, the surfaces 13 are preferably non stick , being for example treated with a coating of FTFE or silicone. The relative movement produced between the shoes .9 and 10 during their engagement with and disengagement from the elements 1 and 2 during the method described above, can be achieved in any suitable way. In the embodiment illustrated in Figures 5 and 6, where the shoes are mounted on the expansible tube, expansion and contraction of the tube may be per orm,ed by for example a mechanical linkage, or a series of opposed inclined planes, or, as in the il ustr A ed embodiment, using hydraulic or pneumatic pressure operated means, preferably the latter. In the illusbrated embodiment, an elongate pressure bag 14, having a closed end 15 and a valve 16 located in its opposite end is disposed within the tube 8. The pressure inside the bag is suitably varied to produce the desired contraction and expansion of the tube 8, whether using positive or negative air pressure inside the bag to produce expansion of the tube. Figure 7 shows an alternative expansible tube construction in which the shoes 9, 10 are formed integrally with the channel members 11 and 12 respectively.Also the inner sides of the bases of, the channel members are formed with part cylindrical seats 17, I8 to support the elongate pressure bag not shown . The elements are otherwise substantially the same as the elements previously described. The method of use of the exparisible tube is likewise similar to the method used for the tube described earlier except that since the shoes 9, 10 are formed integrally with the channels, the tube as a whole is inserted in and extracted from the sections being assembled. Figure 8 of the drawing shows an alternative pair of sections to be assembled with a thermal break between the sections. The sections are generally similar to the elements 1 and 2 previously described and like parts have been allotted the same reference numerals. As previously described, the sections have confronting surfaces 3, 4 and. 3A, LA defining respectively the elongate gaps between the elements 1 and 2, to be filled with a resin to bond the two elements together whilst providing a thermal break between the elements.The expansíble tube 8 to be inserted between the elements is intended to be a close sliding fit between the element s and the wall of the element 1 between the surfaces IJ is formed on the inner side thereof with raised lands lA immediately adjacent the surfaces see Figure 9 against which the outer ends of the integral shoes on the channel members 11, 12 engage whilst holding the elements 1 and 2 for the filling of the gaps 4, 4A. As best seen in the enlarged view 9A of the drawings, the land lA merges with the rest of the wall of the section through a shallow inclined ramp.When the resin in the gaps 4, 4A has set and it is desired to remove the expansible bube and shoes, the inflatable bag is de flated and the sections 11, 72 of the tube are pressed towards each other. Once the outer ends of the tube are thus retracted from the lands lA the tube should ten be sufficiently loose between the sections 1 and 2 to be readily extracted. The provision of the lands enables the tube to be loosened between the sections even though the sections may be have been drawn towards each other slightly by the setting of the resin in the gaps 4, 4a which may contract slightly on setting. The provision of tbe,ramp leading up the lands assists in guiding the corners of the expandible tube into er.gagement with the lands immediately adjacent the surfaces 4, 4A when the tube is expanded to hold the sections for filling of the gaps. The arran ement is otherwise similar to that previously described.
