# VEHICLE DRIVETRAIN INCLUDING VISCOUS CLUTCH

## Abstract
A vehicle drivetrain 16 disclosed includes a viscous clutch 30 that is driven by an auxiliary output 52 of a transaxle 28 to provide four wheel driving when needed while providing two wheel driving at other times. A selector 54 is preferably incorporated to selectively a disconnect the auxiliary output 52 of the transaxle from the pair of wheels not normally driven thereby, b connect the auxiliary output 52 of the transaxle to the second pair of wheels through the viscous clutch 30 , or c connect the auxiliary output 52 of the transaxle to an output 60 of the viscous clutch 30 in a bypassed relationship to the clutch. The drivetrain 16 has particular utility when utilized with a transversely mounted front engine and can be utilized with a transaxle 28 of either the automatic or manual shifting type.
