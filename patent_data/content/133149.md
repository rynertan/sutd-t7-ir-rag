# Rotary sprinkler.

## Abstract
Rotary sprinklers are described comprising a nozzle 10 having an axial bore 11 for forming an axial jet, and a rotor 30 floatingly mounted for axial and rotary movement, the underface of the rotor being formed with a pair of grooves 36 from its center to its outer edge for deflecting the axial jets laterally of the sprinkler and for imparting a rotary motion to the rotor 30 . The rotor 30 further includes a stem 32 depending from its under face and received within the nozzle bore 11 , which stem 32 is formed with a pair of grooves 35 extending axially thereof and merging with the radially extending grooves 36 in the underface of the rotor 30 . Also described are various arrangements for floatingly mounting the rotor 30 by means of a spindle 20 , a cap, or a bridge.
