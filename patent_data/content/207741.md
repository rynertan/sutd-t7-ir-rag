# DRILL BIT SHARPENING DEVICE

## Abstract
A sharpening device, particularly useful for sharpening tools having two identical cutting edges such as drill bits, is used with a support having a rotatable grindstone and a plurality of spaced apart support bearing points. The device has a clamp means for releasably retaining a tool or drill bit in it, and a frame. The frame is connected to the clamp means, and typically carries a first and second set of jig bearing points directed downward and upward respectively, and disposed at an angle to the clamp axis. By virtue of this, the jig can rest in a first rest position in which the clamp axis extends forwardly to a grinding face of a grindstone carrier in the support, at a predetermined lateral angle of A₁ thereto. In addition, by inverting the jig, it can rest on the support, in a second rest position inverted from the first position, in which the second set of jig bearing points rests in a corresponding set of support bearing points, with the clamp axis extending forwardly to the same grindstone grinding face at an equal lateral angle of A₂. Thus, tools such as drill bits, can have each of their cutting edges accurately sharpened, and the other angles required on their points accurately obtained during sharpening, basically by simply inverting the jig holding the bit.
