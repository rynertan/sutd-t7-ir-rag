# Liquified petroleum gas carburetor.

## Abstract
A liquified petroleum gas carburetor 12 receiving LPG as a liquid and through a pair of pressure regulators 20, 30 and a heat exchanger 22 reducing the liquid to a vapor for ingesting into the engine 8 . The heat exchanger 22 is mounted integral with the carburetor 12 and is contiguous with the intake manifold 24 thereby providing a large ther mal mass for elevating the temperature of the LPG. Con nected for synchronous movement are the fuel metering valve 40 and the air metering valve 10 for each car buretor bore. The fuel metering valve moves in response to the air metering valve 10 . A vacuum pressure control 66 is shown to maintain a variable fuel air ratio in response to engine requirements.
