# Can identification method and apparatus.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for forming identification markings on a body wall particularly a concave bottom wall of a thin walled can. A punch having discrete projections separated from one another is displaced relatively toward the can concave bottom wall to cause the projections to penetrate the wall to a depth less than the wall thickness, thereby to form in the can wall, discrete and separate indentations defining at least one recognisable alphanumeric character.
