## Description
This invention relates to a process for the preparation of self emulsifiable epoxy ester copolymer mixtures useful in the production of aqueous emulsionCoating compositions and to the products produced thereby. The present invention provides a process for preparing a self emulsifiable epoxy ester copolymer mixture which comprises esterifying a solvent soluble carboxyl functional polymer with an epoxy resin which is a mixture comprising aromatic polyethers containing oxirane functionality, at least 5 of the aromatic polyethers being constituted by diepoxide, the mixture of aromatic polyethers constituting at least 40 of the total resin solids content and providing oxirane functionality in a stoichiometric deficiency with respect to carboxyl functionality in the carboxyl functional polymer of from 1 2 to 1 20, the esterification being carried out in organic solvent medium in the presence of greater than 2 of an amine esterification catalyst, based on the weight of the reactants subjected to esterification, and at an elevated temperature sufficient to cause the oxirane functionality to react with the carboxyl functionality until the oxirane functionality is substantially entirely consumed and reacting at least a portion of the carboxyl functionality in the resultant polymer epoxy resin hydroxy ester reaction product with a base to render this reaction product self emulsifiable in water. Epoxy resins contain a plurality of aromatic groups joined together by ether linkages, and hence provide excellent physical and chemical properties. It has been difficult to employ such resins in aqueous tedium because they lack storage stability which is of particular importance when spray applicatiod is contemplated, especially for the interior of sanitary cans. In order to employ aqueous coatings of higher resin solids content at the desired viscosity, it has been necessary to employ an emulsion system in which a water immiscible component is suspended in an aqueous continuum by means of an emulsifying agent.In the self emulsifiable mixtures produced according to the process of the present invention, the particle size of the emulsion is substantially the same regardless of whether high speed agitation is used or whether the mixture with water is barely stirred. In the preferred self emulsifiable mixtures produced according to the present invention, a nongelled hydroxy ester copolymer composition substantially free of oxirane functionality comprises an acidic copolymer epoxy resin hydroxy ester in which the epoxy resin is a mixture containing at least 5 by weight of aromatic polyether containing oxirane functionality which is consumed by reaction with the acidic copolymer.The acidic copolymer is a solution copolymer of monoethylenically unsaturated monomers comprising at least about 20 of monoethylenic carboxylic acid, based on the total weight of monomers, and the epoxy resin mixture constitutes at least about 40 of the total resin solids content and provides oxirane functionality in a stoichiometric deficiency with respect to carboxyl functionality in the acidic copolymer of from 1 2 to 1 20. At least a portion of the carboxyl functionality in the copolymer epoxy resin hydroxy ester reaction product is reacted with a base to render the reaction product self emulsifiable in water . An aminoplast or phenoplast resin in small proportion may be used to enhance the cure on baking. In order to provide the best properties, the average molecular weight of the mixture of aromatic polyethers constituting the epoxy resin should be as high as possible and the proportion of diepoxide present in the mixture should also be as high as possible. The high molecular weight introduces problems of incompatibility which can only be resolved by reacting a considerable proportion of oxirane functionality, and this leads to gelation. The preferred epoxy resins have an average molecular weight of at least 1,500. Such high molecular weight aromatic polyethers are incompatible with carboxyl functional addition polymers. Thus, while both materials may be soluble in the same organic solvent, the solutions do not dissolve in one another and tend to separate. These high molecular weight epoxides provide the best properties if they can be used in a compatible form. Also, epoxy resins containing at least about 5 by weight of diepoxides, usually as diglycidyl ethers, function to increase the molecular weight of the copolymers to provide the best properties, but substantially complete esterification of the oxirane groups by the carboxyl groups in the copolymer leads to gelation. The most difficult situations combine high molecular weight epoxy resins with a high proportion of diepoxide, but these provide the best results. In the preferred situation, the epoxy resin includes aromatic polyethers devoid of oxirane functionality, together with a mixture of monoepoxides and diepoxides. It is desired to chemically couple together with the carboxyl copolymer as much epoxide as possible and the inclusion of monoepoxide is helpful. The overall perspective is the same, namely, the more epoxide, monoepoxide or diepoxide, the more total aromatic polyether can be chemically combined with the carboxyl copolymer. The maximum proportion of epoxide, especially diepoxide, is limited in the absence of this invention. More particularly, without this invention, gelatin occurs using the molecular weight and oxirane functionality which is desired, but this gelation is avoided herein. The high molecular weight and complexity of the copolymers formed herein lowers the proportion of curing agent needed, and this provides tougher and more impact resistant cured coatings.Indeed, considerable solvent resistance is obtained in the absence of curing agent, so it can be omitted. The solvent soluble carboxyl functional polymer may be of diverse chemical type, but it is preferably a solution copolymer of monoethylenically unsaturated monomers comprising at least about 20 of monoethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid, based on the total weight of monomers. These solution copolymers are themselves well known, being unusual in this invention solely because of the large amount of copolymerized carboxylic acid. The balance of the copolymer is preferably nonreactive under the contemplated conditions of polymerization, prereaction with the epoxy resin, and cure, but small amounts of other reactive monomers may be tolerated, such as hydroxy monomers illustrated by 2 hydroxy ethyl methacrylate, amide monomers illustrated by acrylamide, or N methylol monomers illustrated by N methylol acrylamide. The nonreactive monomers are illustrated by acrylate and methacrylate esters, such as ethyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate or isobutyl methacrylate, styrene or vinyl toluene, vinyl acetat e, vinyl chloride, vinylidene chloride, acrylonitrile, and the like. Their function herein is to enhance solvent solubility and tilm formation. The carboxyl functional monomer should be present in large proportion so as to provide excess carboxyl functionality, as will be discussed. The preferred minimum proportion is 30 of the weight of monomers. Methacrylic acid provides the best hydrolytic stability and is very much preferred, but other acids are also useful, such as fumaric acid, acrylic acid, crotonic acid, itaconic acid, and the like. Up to about 80 of the monomers may be carboxyl functional, but the maximum proportion is more generally determined by retention of solvent solubility. In this invention the solution copolymer is preformed and reacted with the epoxy resin in the presence of an esterification catalyst, a reaction which would normally lead to gelation. It is frequently desired that the final esterification product include aromatic polyether devoid of oxirane functionality which is not combined by esterification with the carboxyl functional polymer. This is preferably achieved using an epoxy resin which is a mixture of aromatic polyethers devoid of oxirane functionality together with aromatic polyethers having one or two oxirane groups. This procedure maximizes compatibility.However, the aromatic polyether devoid of oxirane functionality can be omitted, or it can be added after esterification is complete in which case the mixture can be heated and agitated to enhance the intimacy of the association between the various components. The copolymer must be made in organic solvent solution so that it is nongelled and organic solvent soluble. The epoxy resin component in the final copolymer composition is a mixture containing at least 5 by weight of aromatic polyether containing oxirane functionality and at least 5 by weight of aromatic polyether devoid of oxirane functionality. Aromatic polyethers, and particularly diglycidyl ethers thereof are well known and available in commerce. The usual aromatic polyether backbone of the epoxy resin is based on a bisphenol which defines a pair of phenolic groups ioined together through an intervening divalent hydrocarbon. The preferred bisphenols have the formula EMI6.1 in which R and R1 are alkyl groups containing up to 8 carbon atoms. Bisphenol A is particularly preferred, this compound having the two OH groups in the para position and R and R1 are each methyl. The epoxy resins which are used herein possess hydroxy groups in addition to epoxy groups, and the higher the molecular weight, the more hydroxy groups are present. In addition, and when the epoxy resit is defunctionalized in order to reduce the proportion of diepoxide therein, additional hydroxy groups are provided. These hydroxy groups may participate in the final curing reaction. The usual epoxy resins available in commerce are made by reaction of epichlorohydrin with Bisphenol A and have a molecular weight in the range of about 350 to 6,000 and comprise or consist of diglycidyl ethers. fixtures having an average molecular weight of at least about 1,500 and containing less than about 50 by weight of diglycidyl ethers are preferred for use herein, and a simple way of providing this is by reacting a lower mclecular weight diglycidyl ether with between 1 and 2 molar proportions of a bisphenol. This increases molecular weight and may provide bisphenol terminal groups. It is preferred to use a mixture containing from 10 to about 95 by weight of aromatic polyethers which are diglycidyl ethers. It is surprising to be able to combine the higher molecular weight epoxy resins preferred herein with preformed copolymers to provide nongelled compositions which do not separate on standing, and this is particularly true where the weight proportion of the epoxy resin which is present is large.It is especially surprising when a proportion of the epoxy resin is devoid of oxirane functionality so that compatibility by coreaction with this component cannot be expected. At least 10 of the aromatic polyethers in the epoxy resin are desirably devoid of oxirane functionality. When about 40 to 90 of the aromatic polyethers are diglycidyl ethers, good solvent resistance is obtained without external curing agents. Defunctionalization of the epoxy resin can be performed in various ways. Reaction with a phenol, particularly a bisphenol has been mentioned previously.Basic catalysts are normally used in this reaction.Similarly, one can use a carboxylic acid, such as benzoic acid or octanoic acid, to defunctionalize the epoxy resin, basic catalysts being again appropriate.In addition, alcohols can be used, such as octanol, and the etherification reaction with alcohol is fostered by the presence of a catalyst such as boron trifluoride. With reference to preferred compositions, the epoxy resin is a mixture of bisphenolic polyethers, at least 10 of which contain oxirane functionality, and at least 10 of which are devoid of oxirane functionality.At least 5 of the total bisphenolic polyethers are provided by diglycidyl ethers. As previously indicated, these bisphenolic polyethers are of relatively high molecular weight, possessing an average molecular weight of at least 1500. The acidic copolymer which is combined with the epoxy resin is a solution copolymer of about 30 70 of methacrylic acid, the balance of the monomers being nonreactive as previously defined, the proportions being based on total resin solids. The epoxy resin mixture constitutes from 50 80 of the total resin solids content, and it provides oxirane functionality in a stoichiometric deficiency with respect to carboxyl functionality of from 1 4 to 1 10. From about 30 to about 90 of the carboxyl functionality in the polymer product is reacted with a volatile amine which may be ammonia, or other volatile amine, such as triethyl amine or, preferably dimethylamino ethanol. The carboxyl functional polymers which are preferred generally have an average molecular weight in the range of 5,000 to 20,000, preferably 7,000 15,000.Molecular weight can be controlled by solids content during polymerization, or catalyst concentration, or polymerization temperature, these being known expedients for this purpose. Mercaptan chain termination is preferably avoided since sanitary can use is contemplated and mercaptans are bad smelling materials. The esterification reaction involving the oxirane groups of the epoxy resin and carboxyl functionality is a conventional reaction which is formally carried out in the presence of a small amount of an amine esterification catalyst. An appropriate catalyst is dimethyl ethanolamine, but many others are known. These catalyts are normally used in an amount of from 0.1 0.3 of the materials subjected to esterification, 0.2 being typical. Up to about 2 of catalyst is broadly contemplated by the art, but rarely used because it would be thought to be a waste of material. Unfortunately, conventional practice produces a gelled product.From the standpoint of gelation theory, gelation normally results when there is present more than one equivalent of oxirane functionality in a difunctional epoxide molecule per molecule of carboxyl functional polymer, and it is frequently desired to exceed this level of use, it being appreciated that all the detectable oxirane is consumed herein. In accordance with the present invention, this difficult esterification reaction is carried in organic solvent medium in the presence of greater than 2 of an amine esterification catalyst, based on the weight of the reactants subjected to esterification. The use of dimethyl ethanolamine as a typical amine esterification catalyst has previously been mentioned, but diverse other amines can be used in the esterification reaction.Other amine esterification catalysts are illustrated by dimethyl benzyl amine, ethanol amine, diethanol amine and morpholine. The choice of amines possessing superior capacity to catalyze the conventional esterification of a carboxylic acid with an epoxy group is itself a matter of common knowledge in the art. Up to about 15 by weight of amine , esterification catalyst can be used, but it is preferred to employ about 4 to about 10. The maximum proportion of catalyst is not critical, but there is a natural desire to avoid the use of an unnecessary excess. The esterification reaction is carried out in organic solvent medium. The solvents are subject to wide variation, so long as they do not interfere with the achievement of an emulsion when the acidic copolymer salts are diluted with water. The fact of achieving an emulsion is easily observed by the fact that the aqueous system which is produced is milky, and not clear.Organic solvents of limited water miscibility, such as xylene, toluene, and butanol are useful, and they may be used alone or together with water miscible solvents, such as 2 ethoxy ethanol or methyl ethyl ketone.Alcoholic solvent mediums are preferred. The solids content of the solution containing the two resins which are combined by esterification is conveniently from 40 to 75 , more preferably from 55 to 70 . As little solvent as possible is desired to minimize the solvent content of the final aqueous emulsions, and the less solvent, the greater the danger of gelation. An elevated esterification temperature sufficient to cause the oxirane functionality to react with the carboxyl functionality is used and is maintained until the oxirane functionality is substantially entirely consumed. Generally, temperatures of from about 600C to about 1300C are useful, but higher temperature speeds the reaction.Esterification of the hydroxy groups is to be avoided during polymer preparation, so water or solvent vapors are not removed and excessive temperature is avoided.The esterification temperature is entirely conventional. It is desired to point out that the large proportion of amine esterification catalyst functions to avoid gelation in a fashion which is not fully understood and that the ester product is different from that which is normally obtained using material selection and proportions which do not produce gelation. It is possible that the large amount of amine causes salt formation with the carboxyl groups present which leads to the formation of colloidal particles in the solvent medium as the esterification reaction increases the molecular weight. This withdraws material from solution before it can gel and may provide the reason why systems which theoretically should form a useless gel, do not do so. In any event, the usual nongelled products are clear compatible solutions. The products herein, when the systems esterified tend to gel, are colloidal disperisons as can be observed by noting their cloudy appearance. The coating composition of this invention is primarily useful for coating aluminum, tinplated steel, pretreated metals, steel, or metals coated with the same or different resin composition i.e., a second coat .The coating composition can be used, however, for coating other substrates, such as wood. The most preferred and useful use of the coating composition is for the interior coating of metal containers that will come in contact with food or beverages. Coating can be done by any coating procedure well known to those skilled in the art, including direct roll coating, reverse roll coating, electrodeposition, spraying, flow coating, and the like. The preferred method, however, in coating the interior of metal containers is by spraying. After coating the substrate, the coating is baked for about 5 seconds to about 30 minutes at between about 2500F. and about 6000F. A typical bake is for about 2 minutes at about 4000. The invention is illustrated in the following examples in which all parts are by weight unless otherwise stated. Example 1An acrylic polymer solution is prepared as follows Parts by WeightEthylene glycol monobutyl ether 2476.0 gmsMethacrylic acid monomer 2766.4 gmsStyrene monomer 2766.4 gmsEthyl acrylate monomer 291.2 gmsTertiary butyl peroxy isopropyl carbonate 388.3 gms TOTAL 8688.3 gmsAll of the above components are premixed in a mixing vessel. 1464.8 gms of the premix are added to a reactor equipped with a stirrer, reflux condenser, thermometer, addition funnel and nitrogen inlet. The nitrogen flow is started and the batch is heated to 1200C, The remaining 7223.5 gms of the premix are added via the addition funnel over a three hour period. Temperature is maintained at 1200C. The batch is held for an additional two hours at 120or. after which the batch is cooled to room temperature. The resulting acrylic polymer solution has a solids content of 717a The acrylic polymer has a composition of methacrylic acid styrene ethyl acrylate in the weight ratio of 47.5 47.5 5. The polymer has an acid number of 300. The epoxy acrylate polymer solution is prepared as follows Parts by WeightEthylene glycol monobutyl ether 67.0 gms n butanol 200.0 gmsAcrylic polymer solution prepared above 432.0 gmsDimethylaminoethanol 60.0 gmsEpon 1007 epoxy resin 480.0 gms TOTAL 1239.0 gms The 67 gms ethylene glycol monobutyl ether and the 200 gms of n butanol are charged to a reaction vessel equipped with a stirrer, reflux condenser, thermometer and a nitrogen inlet.

The batch is held for 1.5 hours at 1260C. The batch does not gel but forms an epoxy acrylate polymer solution. The polymer composition is epoxy acrylic 61 39 by weight. The polymer has an acid number of 77, and an oxirane content less than 0.01 meq gm. This is the smallest detectable amount in the test utilized.The polymer solution has a solids content of 63 . It is desired to stress that the dimethylaminoethanol catalyst has been emplpyed in a much larger than normal proportion, namely, 7.6 ty weight, based on the total weight of materials subiee,e to the esterification reaction. These materials are th acrylic polymer and the epoxy resin. The reaction conditions are such as to promote reaction between the oxirane group in the Epon 1007 and the carboxyl group in the acrylic polymer, and these two components are th material subjected to esterification.In contrast, a repeat of Example 1 utilizing 1.6 grams of dimethylaminoethanol a normal proportion of esterification catalyst corresponding to 0.2 by weight, based on the materials subjected to esterification causes the formation of a useless gel in about 25 minutes after the addition of Epon 1007 is completed.With the larger proportion of amine catalyst which avoids gelation being present, a 25 minute reaction at 1260C. does not result in gelation and the reaction can be continued to completely consume the oxirane functionality.
