# A blood sampling set.

## Abstract
A capillary tube 12 containing a sample is anaerobicly sealed by means of closure caps each comprising an end wall 9 and a skirt portion 13 . Each open end of the capillary tube is sealed by inserting the open tube end into the cap skirt portion, and in order to avoid that a volume of air is forced into the capillary tube, the space defined between the open tube end and the cap end wall is vented to the atmosphere through one or more venting passages 3 defined in the walls of the closure cap or between the inner surface of the cap skirt portion and the adjacent outer peripheral surface of the capillary tube. The open tube end is brought into sealing engagement with sealing means 4 on the cap end wall 9 , and frictional engagement established between the inner surface of the cap skirt portion 13 and adjacent outer peripheral surface parts of the capillary tube secures that said sealing engagement is maintained.
