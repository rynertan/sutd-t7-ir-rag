# SCANNING METHOD AND APPARATUS

## Abstract
A document scanner compensates for mechanical mis alignment between a document and a photosensitive array by storing pixel information from the array and timing the output of such information in accordance with stored offset values which represent the mechanical misalignment for successive relative positions of the document and of the array.
