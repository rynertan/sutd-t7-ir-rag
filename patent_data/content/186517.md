## Description
ELECTROMAGNETIC REFLECTION BODY This invention relates to an electromagnetic reflection body, for use in an electromagnetic wave reflector, an electromagnetic interference shielding plate or the like. An electromagnetic reflection body is required to be used in an electromagnetic wave reflector as a parabolic antenna for radio wave communication or in an electromagnetic interference shielding plate for office automatic apparatus such as personal computers, facsimile equipment and copying machines. For this purpose, a metallic plate, metallic foil, or woven or nonwoven fabric made from carbon fiber or aluminium coated glass fiber is suitably used as an electromagnetic reflecting member. These electromagnetic reflecting members are bonded to a back up member made of synthetic resin for example, to thereby provide a desired strength. Additionally, after the electromagnetic reflecting member is bonded to the back up member as mentioned above, a coating for protecting the electromagnetic reflecting member is applied to the electromagnetic reflection surface of the electromagnetic reflecting member. On the other hand, when microwaves using an SHF wave or an EHF wave are transmitted and received by means of a parabolic antenna, it is possible to reduce a wave attenuation factor by reducing the thickness of the surface protecting layer in the antenna. Therefore, in order to make such a protecting layer as thin as possible, it is optimum to perform the application of the coating. However, when a metal such as aluminium is used as an electromagnetic reflecting member, a preliminary treatment or an undercoating is required prior to the coating. resulting in an increase of working equipment and working steps. Moreover, in respect of the surface coating on the electromagnetic reflecting member, maintenance such as repainting is required when a parabolic antenna is used over a long time. The present invention aims to provide an electromagnetic reflecting body wherein there may be readily provided a film on a surface of an electromagnetic reflecting member without coating after an electromagnetic reflecting member is bonded to a back up member. According to the invention, there is provided an electromagnetic reflection body comprising a composite sheet member composed of an electromagnetic reflecting member and a resin film previously bonded to the reflection surface thereof, and a back up member bonded to the back surface of the composite sheet member. Therefore, the electromagnetic reflection body according to the invention may be manufactured only by bonding the composite sheet member to the back up member. Also, since the resin film is previously bonded to the front surface of the composite sheet member, it is possible to protect the electromagnetic reflecting member. The invention will be further described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawing, which is a partially sectional view of an embodiment of an electromagnetic reflection body according to the invention. The electromagnetic reflection body shown in the drawing comprises a composite sheet member 10 bonded to a back up member 12 through an adhesion layer 14. In the composite sheet member 10, a resin film 20 as a protective layer is previously bonded to an electromagnetic reflection surface of an electromagnetic reflecting member 16 through an adhesion layer 18. The back surface of the composite sheet member 10 is bonded to the back up member 12 through the adhesion layer 14. In this case, the composite sheet member 10 is parabolically shaped before the composite sheet member is bonded to the back up member 12. The adhesion layer 14 is composed of an adhesive layer 22 alone or a combination of the adhesive layer 22 with an adhesion resin film 24 as shown in the drawing. Once the back up member 12 is molded, the composite sheet member 10 may be bonded thereto through only the adhesive layer 22. However, it is preferred that the composite sheet member 10 is previously provided with the adhesion layer 14 in order to make the one piece molding of these members easy. In the case of the one piece molding, it is desirable that in order to prevent the adhesive from flowing in the molding, a woven or nonwoven sheet member which permits the adhesive to permeate therethrough in the molding such as woven or nonwoven glass fiber fabric is interposed between the adhesion layer and the back up member. Such an interposition of the sheet member not only prevents the flowing of the adhesive in the molding, but also exhibits a favourable effect on air escape. As the electromagnetic reflecting member 16, use may be made of a metallic plate, metallic foil, metallic net, metal plated film, metal deposited film and metal containing film as well as woven fabrics, knitted goods, nonwoven fabrics and the like of a conductive fiber such as metallic fiber, carbon fiber, metal plated organic fiber, metal plated glass fiber, aluminium coated glass fiber, or copper sulfide deposited acrylic fiber. In the case of using an aluminium foil, when the thickness is small, premolding is difficult and thus wrinkles are apt to be caused. Also the aluminium foil is drawn toward a rib provided at the back up member in the molding to easily cause wrinkles. On the contrary, when the thickness is large, its weight becomes heavy. Therefore, a thickness of about 30 150 vm is preferable. As the resin film 20 and the adhesion resin film 24, use may be made of urethane series film non yellowing type is preferable , acrylic film, fluorine series film Teflon, Tedlar, Kynar and the like , olefin series film, polyester film, vinyl chloride film and the like.In the case of out door use, the urethane series and fluorine series films can be applied. In case of usingTedlar film, when the thickness is too large, heat shrinkage is prduced to cause peeling and strain so that the thickness is preferably not more than 100 vm. As the adhesive layers 18 and 22, urethane series, epoxy series, rubber series, acrylic series and ethylene vinyl acetate EVA series adhesives are suitable.Further, as the back up member 12, use may be made of thermoplastic, fiber reinforced thermoplastic FRTP , thermoset plastic, and fiber reinforced thermoset plastic FRP resins. The invention will be further described with reference to the following illustrate Examples.Example 1 A composite sheet member 10 composed of an aluminium foil as an electromagnetic reflecting member 16 having a thickness of 40 vm and a fluorine series film, Tedlar trade name, made by E.I. Du Pont Co, , having a thickness of 38 Bm as a resin film 20 bonded to one side of the aluminium foil through a urethane series adhesive layer 18 was subjected to drawing into a predetermined parabolic shape. On the other hand, a sheet molding compound SMC containing 30 by weight of glass as a back up member 12 was subjected to a compression molding at a heating temperature of 1400C under a pressure of 70 kg cm2 into a parabolic shape. To the electromagnetic reflection surface or mirror surface of the back up member 12 made of FRP was bonded the drawn composite sheet member 10 so as to face theTedlar film to an electromagnetic reflection surface, using an epoxy series adhesive as an adhesive layer 22.In this case, an adhesion resin film 24 as shown in the drawing was not used.Example 2 To both sides of an electromagnetic reflecting member 16 made of aluminium foil having a thickness of 40 Vm were bonded Tedlar films each having a thickness of 38 um as a resin film 20 and an adhesion resin film 24 through a urethane series adhesive as an adhesive layer 18 and an adhesive layer 22 to thereby provide a composite sheet member 10 provided at both sides with the films. The resulting composite sheet member 10 was parabolically preshaped in the same manner as described in Example 1 and then integrally united with a sheet molding compound as a back up member 12 under compressing and heating. Consequently, the Tedlar film served as an adhesive to omit the application of an adhesive to the back surface of the composite sheet member 10.Example 3 An aluminium foil having a thickness of 40 um was used as an electromagnetic reflecting member 16 in the same manner as described in Example 1, to the reflection surface of which was bonded the Tedlar film having a thickness of 38 um as a resin film 20 and to the back surface of which was bonded Modick modified polypropylene as an adhesion resin film 24 to form a composite sheet member 10. The resulting composite sheet member 10 was parabolically preshaped and thereafter integrally united with a sheet molding compound as a back up member 12. As mentioned above, in the electromagnetic reflection body according to the invention, an electromagnetic reflecting member previously provided at its reflection surface with a resin film is used, so that there is no necessity for applying a coating to the reflection surface after the one piece molding and therefore it is possible to obtain an electromagnetic reflection body which is easy to produce and which has excellent durability.
