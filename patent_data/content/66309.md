# Sulphur recovery process.

## Abstract
In a process for the removal of H₂S and optionally CO₂, from a gaseous stream by contacting with a reactant solution containing a on or a chelate compound of a polyvalent metal and optionally an absorbent selective for CO₂, the presence of an alkanediol having 4 to 12 C atoms accelerates the oxidation H₂S to sulphur and the regeneration of the reactant by the reduced reactant with an oxygen containing gas.
