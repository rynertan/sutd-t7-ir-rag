Viral infections are widespread and result in a wide variety of symptoms. Some viral infections are easily overcome by the body s defense mechanism while others are of a more serious nature leading to permanent damage, e.g., blindness, and even to death. One such family of viruses which may cause serious infections is the Herpes virus group. The drugs presently used to treat viral infections are ineffective in many cases or, if effective, are needed in large and or continuous dosages which produce serious side effects and or toxicity. Therefore there a need for an effective antiviral agent which is effective at lower dosages than the presently available drugs, thus diminishing the chance of possible side effects and toxicity.

To a OOC solution of the dried, crude mono t butyl dimethylsilyl derivative prepared in Part A in pyridine 100 mL was added benzoyl chloride 5 mL . The mixture was allowed to come to room temperature 210C and left for 24 hours before evaporation in vacuo. The residue was chromatographed on a column of silica gel 300 g using gradient elution consisting of 2L of dichloromethane and 2L of 5 methanol in dichloromethane. A crude separation afforded 3.5 g of amber foam consisting mainly of 9 l benzoyloxy 3 t butyldimethylsilyloxy 2 propoxymethyl N2 benzoylguanine. C.

EXAMPLE 1 To a stirred suspension of 9 l benzoyloxy 3 hydroxy 2 propoxymethyl N2 benzoylguanine 463 mg prepared inPreparation VI in ethyl acetate 10 mL cooled to 00C, was added pyrophosphoryl chloride 0.75 ml . After 2 hours, the reaction was quenched by the addition of ice, then brought to pH 5 by the addition of solid sodium hydrogen carbonate, causing the phosphorylated product to oil out of solution. The supernatant was decanted off and the remaining residue was dissolved in water and extracted with 10 butanol in dichloromethane v v .

This residue was dissolved in a mixture of pyridine 10 mL and water 5 mL containing 4 morpholino N,N dicyclohexylcarboxamidine 138 mg and then evaporated in vacuo. The residue was then co evaporated three times with 10 mL portions of pyridine. A solution of the resulting foam in pyridine 60 mL was added dropwise over 45 minutes to a refluxing solution of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide 194 mg in pyridine 50 mL . When addition was complete, the mixture was refluxed for an additional 2.75 hours before being evaporated in vacuo to a white solid.A solution of the solid in water 30 mL was extracted three times with an equal volume of ether, then concentrated in vacuo to approximately 1 mL.

The l monophosphate ester of 9 dihydroxy 2 propoxymethyl guanne as the diammonium salt 520 mg was converted to the free acid by passage through a column of Dowex 50 X8 cation exchange resin 45 ml using water 1 L. as eluent. The residue, left on evaporation of the water, was dissolved in a mixture of pyridine 25 ml and water 10 ml containing 4 morpholinoN,N dicyclohexylcarboxamidine 350 mg , then evaporated in vacuo. The residue was co evaporated three times with 10 ml portions of pyridine. A solution of the resulting foam in pyridine 150 ml was added dropwise over 1 hour to a refluxing solution of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide 500 mg in pyridine 120 ml . When addition was complete, the mixture was refluxed an additional 2.5 hours before being evaporated in vacuo to a white solid.A solution of the solid in water 100 ml was extracted three times with 10 butanol in dichloromethane v v 30 ml then once with diethyl ether 30 ml . The aqueous solution was concentrated in vacuo to 5 ml and applied onto a column 2.5 cm x 40 cm of DEAE Sephadex A 25 gel in the carbonate form. The column was eluted with a linear gradient consisting of 1 L of water and 1 L of 0.6M triethylammonium bicarbonate pH 7.6 . Eluent containing pure product was lypholyzed leaving 282 mg of amorphous solid. The solid was dissolved in water 2 ml and applied on a column of Dowex 50 8X cation exchange resin 5 ml which was then washed with water until the eluent was devoid of UV absorbance 200 ml .
