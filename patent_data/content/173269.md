# Semiconductor laser device.

## Abstract
A semiconductor laser device comprises a multilayer semiconductor structure including an active region 16 which includes an active layer 3 for emitting light responsive to sti mulation, a first control region 17 including a guide layer for guiding light which is being propagated, and a second control region 15 including a guide layer 2 provided with a diffrac tion grating 10 for guiding light which is being propagated. The active region 16 , first control region 17 and second control region 15 are arranged in a row along an axis of res onance. Furthermore, the device comprises an active elec trode 7 for injecting a current into the active region 16 , a first control electrode 8 and a second control electrode 6 for injecting currents respectively into the first and second control regions 17, 15 , means 13 for applying a drive current I
