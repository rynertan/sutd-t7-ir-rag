## Description
PROCESS FOR PREPARATIONA 5,5 HETHYLENEBIS 2 HYDROXY 4 ALKOXYBENZOPHENONE Background of the lavencton This invention relates to 2 hydroxy 4 alkoxybenzophenone ultraviolet radiation absorbing compounds, to a process for preparing such compounds, to synthetic resins stabilized against the harmful effects of ultraviolet radiation by incorpotating in such resins small quantittes of such compounds, and to stabilizer compositions comprising such compounds in combination with a known polymer stabilizer.Certain 2 hydroxy 4 alkoxybenzophenone compounds are known to be effective ultraviolet absorbers and light stabilizers, with the 2 hydroxyl group critically necessary for effectiveness. These are among a large number of classes of compounds disclosed in the patent literature as nesting the requirements for an effective u traviolet radiation absorber. In lieu of individual references. the review byC. W. Lappin in Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Technology N. Bikales, ed. New York, John Wiley interscience. 19 1 Vol. 14, pages 125 to 148 can be consulted.According to Lappin s review, the 18 2 hydroxybenzophenone compounds indicated to be in commercial use as stabilizers are low to moderate molecular weight compounds having a single benzophenone unit in the molecule. Lappin refers to problems of compatibility of the additive stabilizer with the polymer being stabilized, including such propertles as the solubility of the addiriverin the polymer, the rate of difusion of the additive through the polymer. and the rate of loss of the additive from the polymer. Lappin characterizes compatibility as a sensitlq function of molecular structure and not entirely prodictable .Among attempts to improve on the comercially available 2 hydroxybenzophencnss, Lappin Indicates that longer outdoor life of polymers might be obtained with relatively high molecular weight ultraviolet radiation absorbers and states that attempts to utilize polymeric and polymerizable absorbers for this purpose had given ambiguous results and not been commercially successful.Subsequent attempts to overcome the inadequacies of the conventional ultraviolet absorber stabilizers include a number of disclosures of 2hydroxybenzophenones having either a plurality of benzophenone units in the molecule or functional group substitution in addition to hydroxyl and alkoxyl. Thus, Lappin in U.S. Patent 3,310,525 of March 21, 1967 disclosed alpha omega bis 2 hydroxybenzoyl alkane stabilizers for polyesters and poly alpha olefin resins, having a formulaEMI2.1 wherein n is an integer in a range from 2 to 8, and X, Y and Z are independently selected from the group of hydrogen, C1 C4 alkoxy and Cl C4 alkyl radicals.H. Dressler in U.S. Patent 3,399,237 of August 27, 1968 disclosed ultraviolet light stabilizing derivatives of 4 benzoylresorcinol having the formulaEMI2.2 wherein Z is a member selected from the group consisting of sulfur andEMI2.3 and R is a member selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and alkyl having from 1 11 carbon atoms.M. Minagawa in Japan Kokai 74 78,692 of July 29, 1974 disclosed 2hydroxybenzophenone derivatives carrying cyclic imide substituents linked to the 4 position of the 2 hydroxybenzophenone by an alkyleneoxy group, for example 4 2 phthalimidethoxy 2 hydroxybenzophenone.M. Minagawa in Japan Kokai 75 74579 of June 19, 1975 disclosed 2hydroxybenzophenone derivatives having from 2 to 7 hydroxybenzophenone units linked through such bivalent groups as methylene, methyleneoxymethylene, cyclohexylidene, sulfide, sulfinyl, sulfonyl, alkylidene, carboxyalkylidene, and carbalkoxyalkylidene, including for example methylenebis 2 hydroxy 4 methoxybenzophenone . The location of attachment of the bivalent linking group on the 2 hydroxybenzophenone unit is nowhere specified by Mlnagawa. M. Minagawa in Japan Kokal 75 86487 of July 11, 1975 disclosed 2 hydroxybenzophenone derivatives substituted in unspecified ring position with N methylene cyclic amide and N methylene cyclic imide groups. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In accordance with this invention a 2 hydroxy 4 alkoxybenzophenone having 1 to 12 carbon atoms in the alkoxy group 1s caused to react with formaldehyde and an amine represented by the formula HNR1R2. In which R1 and R2 taken together form a 5 to 6 member heterocyclic ring free of carbonyl groups and including the nitrogen atom, or are independently hydrogen or alkyl groups having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, provided that R1 and R2 are not simultaneously hydrogen. Thl. reaction provides a novel 2 hydroxy 4 alkoxy 5 aminomethyl benzophenone represanted by Formula I.EMI3.1 In which R, Rl, and R2 are as defined above.The new 2 hydroxy 4 alkoxy 5 aminomethylbenzophenone Is an effective stabilizer for polymers such as polyacides, polyesters both saturated and unsaturated, polyacetals. polyolefins, and polyurethanes, as well as a catalyst for the conversion of organic tsospnates to Isocyanurates I.e. trimerized isocyanates . The 2 hydroxy 4 alkoxy 5 aminomethyl benzophenone can also react, suitably In the presence of an alkaline catalyst, wlth a 2 hydroxy 4 alkoxybenzophenone or with itself to give a 5,5 methylene bls 2 hydroxy 4 al koxybenzophenone represented by formula 11 which can be recovered in high yield and purity while minimizing formation of less desirable isomers and by products. Reactions for the preparation of a new 2 hydroxy 4 alkoxy 5 amlno methylbenzophenone reaction A and subsequent conversion to a 5,5 methylenebis 2 hydroxy 4 alkoxybenzophenone reaction B can be written as follows EMI4.1 X ls hydrogen or CH2NRR2. Thus, when X is hydrogen, reaction B Is a condensation of 2 hydroxy 4 alkoxy 5 aminomethylbenzophenone with 2 hydroxy 4 alkoxybenzophenone to give 5,5 methylenebis 2 hydroxy 4 alkoxybenzophenone When X Is CH2NR1R2. the reaction can be written as a dimerization of self condensation of 2 hydroxy 4 alkoxy 5 aminomethylbenzophenone reactionC to give 5,5 methylcnebis 2 hydroxy 4 alkoxybenrophenonc as follows EMI5.1 When the 2 hydroxy 4 alkoxybenzophenone used In reaction A with amine and formaldehyde to make the 2 hydroxy 4 alkoxy 5 aminomethylbenzo phenone is different from the 2 hydroxy 4 alkoxybenzophenone used in the condensation reaction B with the 2 hydroxy 4 alkoxy 5 aminomethyl benzophenone to give the methylene disubstituted benzophenone product, there can be obtained In an unamblguous and selective manner an unsymmetrical bis benzophenone of the fornula EMI5.2 In which R and R are dissimilar alkyl groups having I to 12 carbon atoms, as Illustrated by the following reaction sequence using first 2 hydroxy 4 n octoxybenzophenone in the aminomethylation reaction.followed by the condensation of the aminomethyl derivative with 2 hydroxy 4 methoxybenzophenone EMI5.3 When a 2 hydroxy 4 alkoxy 5 aminomethylbenzophenone is used as a polymer stabilizer to protcct a polymer against the harmful effects of light of wavelength less than 400 nanometers, effective concentrationsIn the polymer range from 0.01 to 1 by weight of the polymer being stabilized.Known polymer stabilizers can be used in combination with a 2 hydroxy 4 alkoxy 5 aminomethylbenzophenone of the invention in proportions of 0.1 part of known stabilizers up to 10 parts of known stabilizer per part of 2 hydroxy 4 alkoxy 5 aminomethylbenzophenoneDESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTSIn formula I of the 2 hydroxy 4 alkoxy 5 aminomethylbenzophenone of this invention, R, FL and R2 can be for example methyl, ethyl, propyl, Isopropyl, butyl, s butyt, isobutyl, butyl, alkyl, Isoamyl, hexyl , 2 ethylbutyl, and 4 methylpent 2 yl.
