# Microwave assisting sputtering.

## Abstract
Apparatuses for forming a film at an increased rate that is necessary for putting the microwave assisting sputtering into practice on an industrial scale. The feature resides in that a plasma is maintained uniformly on the whole surface of target 1 , composed of a material to be sputtered. This makes it pos sible to avoid the target 1 from being thermally destroyed by the increased energy of sputtering. Further, in order to prevent damage on a substrate on which the film is to be sputtered by plasma for sputtering, consideration is given to the arrange ment of magnetic devices 10, 13 in order to form the film by positively introducing the plasma onto the substrate on which the film is to be formed and, at the same time, effecting the sputtering 11 . There are further disclosed an apparatus in which the plasma is generated by microwaves at a position close to the target to effectively utilize the energy of micro waves for the sputtering, and a cathode structure on which a conical target is placed by taking into consideration the fact that the sputtered particles emitted from the target travel in compliance with the cosine law.
