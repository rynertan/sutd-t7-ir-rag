# APPARATUS FOR INSTALLING RIVET NUTS

## Abstract
Apparatus for installing rivet nuts comprises a body 9 having therein a spindle 5 which is drivable in the forward and reverse directions and a threaded mandrel 29 for receiving the rivet nut, and an anvil 35 against which the rivet nut abuts. In order to avoid damaging of the rivet nut when crimping it in position, a clutch 45, 47 is disposed between the spindle and threaded mandrel to prevent rotation of the latter when a predetermined torque is reached. The mandrel is engaged by a pull sleeve 21 and an axial load is applied to the mandrel and hence to the rivet nut by way of a pull nut 19 which is received threadingly on the spindle and which co operates with the pull sleeve 21 .
