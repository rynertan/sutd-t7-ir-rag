## Description
SYSTEMS FOR PRODUCING ELECTROPLATED AND OR TREATED METAL FOIL The present invention relates to a system for producing electrodeposited and or treated metal or metal alloy foil having improved laminate adhesion.More particularly, the present invention relates to systems for electrochemically producing and or treating copper or copper alloy foil for use in electrical and electronic applications. Electrodeposition techniques for continuously producing metal or metal alloy foil from an electrolyte solution containing metal values is well known in the art. The ability to form high quality foil using these techniques is often related to the quality of electrolyte solution being used. The presence of impurities such as particulate matter from the atmosphere, grease and or oil in the electrolyte solution can greatly diminish over all foil quality. To deal with this problem, some prior art electrodeposition systems have incorporated a single filtration loop for removing impurities from the electrolyte solution.U.S. Patent Nos. 1,417,464 and 1,425,184, both toEdison, illustrate one such filtration loop. Today, most printed circuits are formed by bonding either electrodeposited or wrought metal foil to a substrate material, generally a synthetic polymer, with an adhesive and subjecting the composite structure to an acid etching treatment for forming the desired circuit. Because the adhesion between bare or untreated metal foil and non metallic substrate materials tends to be weak, considerable effort has been directed toward the development of techniques for increasing the bond strength or laminate adhesion of the metal foil.These bond strength improvement techniques generally comprise roughening at least that surface of the metal foil to be bonded to the substrate material. Early techniques for improving adhesion generally comprised forming an adherent oxide layer on the copper or copper alloy foil surface to be bonded to the substrate material. The oxide layer was typically formed by treating the copper or copper alloy foil with an aqueous alkaline oxidizing solution. Both chemical and electrolytic treatments were used. U.S. Patent Nos. 3,107,197 toStein et al. and 3,114,683 to Chorney illustrate some of these early treatments. In one such treatment, a sheet of copper with an anodically produced adherent oxide coating was drawn through aNaOH bath and cathodically polarized to reduce the oxide coating to metallic copper.Prior to being laminated to the substrate material, a layer of tin or a tin alloy was deposited on the copper. FrenchPatent Publication No. 1,371,510 to RotschildNominees Limited illustrates this treatment. More recently, techniques have been developed for improving adhesion by depositing a layer of dendritic structures onto the metal or metal alloy foil. The dendritic structures serve to increase the surface area of the foil and thereby improve the bond which is primarily mechanical in nature.In most of these techniques, a nodular powdery copper layer, primarily copper or copper oxide particles, is electrodeposited onto the foil surface. These particles take the form of random nodular clusters that increase the over all foil surface area. As a result of these nodular structures and the increase in foil surface area, stronger bonds which are predominantly mechanical in nature can be formed with the substrate material. Since the particles forming the dendritic layer tend to be powdery and loose, a second or locking layer is generally formed over the dendritic layer. This locking layer is typically a smooth deposit of copper or some other metal which conforms to the configuration of the dendritic layer.Its function is to reduce the powder transfer characteristics of the dendritic layer and to maintain the configuration of the dendrites intact during the subsequent circuit fabrication operations. The locking layer may be a copper or copper alloy layer or a layer of some other metal or metal alloy such as nickel, cobalt, zinc, chromium and alloys thereof. In some of these techniques, a preliminary cleaning step is performed on the metal or metal alloy foil before the dendrite forming operation. This preliminary cleaning step is generally intended to provide an oxide free, degreased surface for treatment.Typical cleaning treatments include immersion in an alkaline cleaning solution or electrolytic degreasing in an alkaline solution. U.S. PatentNos. 3,220,897 to Conley et al., 3,293,109 to Luce et al., 3,322,656 to Dahringer et al., 3,328,275 toWaterbury, 3,518,168 to Byler et al., 3,585,010 to Luce et al., 3,699,018 to Carlson, 3,857,681 toYates et al., 3,918,926 to Wolski et al., 4,049,481 to Morisaki, 4,053,370 to Yamashita et al. and Re.30,180 to Wolski et al. exemplify these dendritic treatments. Most recently, a technique has been developed for applying a dendritic copper treatment, referred to as a coral copper treatment in the art, to copper and copper alloy foils using a current having regularly recurring pulses. In this technique, the foil to be treated is immersed in a copper sulfate sulfuric acid solution as a cathode.When the pulsed current is applied, copper dendrites are formed on the foil during a first portion of each pulse and are bonded to the foil surface during a second portion of each pulse. It has been discovered that this technique, illustrated in U.S. Patent No. 4,468,293 to Polan et al., forms well bonded dendritic structures that significantly improve the adhesion properties of copper or copper alloy foil. One problem which has continually plagued both electrodeposited and treated foil producers is poor quality foil. For electrodeposited foil producers, the problem is avoiding the production of foil having a large number of pinholes and or elemental impurities. For treated foil producers, the problem is mainly the uneven plating produced by some prior treatments. This uneven plating problem often takes the form of bare spots and unplated streaks on the treated foil. These bare spots and unplated streaks become zones of poor adhesion in the finished circuit board a most undesirable condition, particularly with the current trend towards finer, narrower circuit lines and the use of thinner metal foils. In accordance with the present invention, a system is provided for producing electrodeposited and or treated metal foil having surface appearance, uniformity and reproducibility superior to that which is currently commercially available.The system of the present invention also provides economic benefits as well as improved quality foil. The system of the present invention includes means for improving the quality of the electrochemical solutions used to produce the electrodeposited and or treated metal foil. This means takes the form of a dual filtration system associated with each on line processing treatment tank. The dual filtration system for each tank has a solution conditioning loop through which solution from each on line processing treatment tank is continuously withdrawn and passed through a filter to remove suspended particulate matter. The dual filtration system also has means for removing surface impurities from the solution in each on line tank. The surface impurity removing means may comprise a skimmer floating on the surface of the solution in the tank and or an overflow system for removing solution from the tank and passing it through an off line solution filtration replenishment loop. The system of the present invention has been found to be greatly useful in the production of treated metal foil having a reduced number of bare spots or unplated regions. In a preferred system for producing such foil, a strip of electrodeposited or wrought foil is first electrolytically cleaned in a caustic solution contained in a first treatment tank. After being cleaned, the foil is passed to a second treatment tank where a fresh layer of metal is formed, preferably electrolytically, on at least one surface of the foil. This fresh metal layer renders the at least one foil surface more uniformly electrochemically active and more receptive to the subsequent dendritic treatment. Immediately thereafter, the foil is passed to a third treatment tank where a plurality of dendritic structures are electrodeposited on and bonded to the surface s having the freshly formed metal layer.After the layer of dendritic structures has been formed on the foil, the foil is subjected to an anti tarnishing treatment to improve its appearance. The anti tarnishing treatment is applied by immersing the foil in an anti tarnishing solution in yet another treatment tank. As a final step, the treated foil is washed and dried before being wound upon a take up reel. In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, the adhesive properties of metal or metal alloy sheet, strip or foil are improved by first forming a substantially uniform layer of metal oxide on each surface to be treated and thereafter chemically converting the oxide layer to a substantially uniform metal layer. Subsequent thereto, the sheet, strip or foil with the fresh metal layer is subjected to a dendritic treatment. The metal foil treatment system also has, as part of the solution filtration replenishment loop, a plurality of off line tanks in which the solution for each treatment step may be initially made up and or replenished. The provision of an off line solution replenishment capability greatly reduces the costs associated with the foil treatment line.As previously mentioned, the solution filtration replenishment loop may be used to remove surface impurities as well as other contaminants from the solution. The filtration replenishment loop preferably includes at least one filter for removing contaminants and or surface impurities from the solutions being withdrawn from and being transferred to the on line tanks. As part of the solution filtration replenishment loop associated with each on line tank, the solution in each on line tank may be withdrawn and replaced as a batch in response to a sensed condition of the solution or may be continuously withdrawn and replaced by fresh solution. The ability of the present system to produce foil with improved quality is further enhanced by the provision of the solution conditioning loop for each treatment tank. Each conditioning loop has means for substantially continuously withdrawing solution from the treatment tank and circulating it through a filtering device to remove particulates and unwanted residual contaminants. If needed, each conditioning loop may have a heat exchanger for modifying the temperature of the withdrawn solution. Temperature modification of the solution may be needed to assist in the removal of the particulate and contaminants and or to provide solution at a desired temperature back to the treatment tank. In lieu of or in addition to using the solution filtration replenishment loop to remove surface impurities, a skimmer may be placed in each on line tank. Its discharge may be connected through appropriate conduits and valves to either the replenishment filtration loop or the conditioning loop associated with the on line tank. In addition to providing improved treated foil, the present invention has been found to have applicability to the production of improved quality electrodeposited foil. To produce such foil, the electrochemical solution from which the foil is formed is continually filtered to remove surface impurities, particulate matter and other contaminants. The solution is continuously withdrawn from the electrodeposition processing tank and passed through a conditioning loop having a filter to remove particulate matter and unwanted chemicals from the solution. Any surface impurities are removed from the solution by a skimmer floating on the surface of the solution and or solution overflow into a solution replenishment filtration loop. To consistently produce electrodeposited or treated metal foil of improved quality, the foil being produced and or treated must accurately track through the various treatment processing tanks. To this end, the present system includes a laser beam alignment system for aligning the various rolls over which and with which the foil makes contact.The alignment system includes a reference system parallel to the direction of foil travel, a laser beam generator mounted to the reference system and movable optical devices for generating orthogonal alignment beams. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a system for producing treated metal foil having improved quality. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a system as above for providing electrodeposited foil having improved quality. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a system as above that provides significant economic benefits. It is still a further object of the present invention to provide a system as above for forming and or treating copper and copper alloy foil to be used in electronic and electrical applications. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a treatment for increasing the adhesion properties of metal and metal alloy materials and for reducing the number of bare spots and unplated streaks on the treated materials. These and other objects and advantages will become more apparent from the following description and drawings in which like reference numerals depict like elements. Figure 1 is a schematic representation of a system in accordance with the present invention for treating metal foil. Figure 2 is a schematic representation of the off line processing tanks, solution replenishment filtration loops and conditioning loops associated with the treatment tanks in the system of Figure 1. Figure 3 is a schematic representation of a system in accordance with the present invention for producing electrodeposited foil. Figure 4 illustrates a laser alignment system to be used in either the system of Figure 1 or the system of Figure 3. Figure 5 is a schematic representation of an alternative apparatus for forming treated metal foil. In accordance with the present invention, a system is provided for producing electrodeposited and or treated metal foil of superior quality. The present system makes use of a dual filtration technique to remove particulate matter and other impurities from the solutions used to produce the electrodeposited and or treated foil. Removal of the particulates and impurities from these solutions removes one of the major causes of inferior quality foil. The system of the present invention has particular utility in providing metal or metal alloy foil for use in electronic and electrical applications. While the present invention will be discussed in the context of producing and treating copper and copper alloy foils, it should be recognized that the present invention has wider applicability.Other metal and metal alloy foils of superior quality may be produced and treated using the present system. As used herein, the term foils includes metal and metal alloy strip and sheet materials. Referring now to Figures 1 and 2, a system for producing treated copper or copper alloy foil is illustrated. The copper or copper alloy foil 10 to be treated is payed off a reel not shown. The foil 10 may be either electrodeposited or wrought foil.If desired, the foil 10 may have been subjected to a preliminary cleaning treatment for removal of bulk oil and grease. This preliminary cleaning treatment may comprise any suitable treatment known in the art and may be done either on line or off line. The type of cleaning treatment and cleaning equipment used will of course depend upon the compositional nature of the foil 10 and the type or types of greases and or oils to be removed.When the foil 10 is formed from a copper base material, bulk grease and oil are preferably removed by immersing the foil in a methylene chloride solution. The initial treatment applied to the foil 10 by the system of Figures 1 and 2 is a cleaning treatment primarily designed to remove residual grease, oil and other contaminants from earlier processing of the foil. The foil 10 passes over a roll 12 and into a first treatment tank 14. The tank 14 contains a cleaning solution 16 designed to remove the residual contaminants, grease and oil.While any suitable cleaning solution and cleaning technique may be used in this initial treatment, it is preferred to electrolytically clean the foil 10 using a caustic cleaning solution. It is preferred to use such a technique because the electrolytic action enhances the solvent action of the caustic solution. More particularly, the agitation produced at the foil surfaces by the hydrogen bubbles generated from the electrolysis greatly facilitates the cleaning action of the solution. While any suitable caustic cleaning solution may be used to effect cleaning, it has been found that aqueousNaOH solutions, such as a 3 15 NaOH solution or a solution that is a mixture of NAOH, Na3PO4, Na2SiO3 and Na2CO3, provide excellent cleaning degreasing results. The cleaning solution may be used at room temperature or at an elevated temperature.For example, a 10.5 g l NaOH, 9.6 g l Na3PO4, 40 g lNa2SiO3 and 20.9 g l Na2CO3 solution at 600C may be used to clean the copper or copper alloy foil 10. It has been found that improved cleaning results are obtained when the caustic cleaning solution 16 is kept at an elevated temperature. ForNaOH solutions, the temperature of the solution 16 may be maintained in the range of about 40 0C to about the boiling temperature of the solution, preferably from about 500C to about 700C. The solution in the tank 14 may be maintained at the desired temperature by means of an appropriate in tank heater and control loop not shown. Any appropriate in tank heater and control loop known in the art may be used. The electrolytic cleaning is preferably performed by applying a cathodic currept to the foil 10. The foil 10 passing through the cleaning solution 16 may be made cathodic by bearing against a roller, such as roller 12, which has been formed from an electrically conductive material such as copper and which is electrically connected to the negative terminal of a power supply 18. The power supply 18 may comprise any suitable DC or AC power supply known in the art. The foil 10 may be passed through the cleaning solution in any known manner. For example, the foil may be threaded through a series of rollers 20, 22, 24, 26 and 28 immersed in the solution 16 so that the foil travels up and down in successive vertical planes through the length of the tank. Vertical anode plates 30 may be fixed in the tank 14 facing the foil surfaces. The plates 30 may be mounted in the tank in any suitable manner known in the art and may be electrically connected to the positive terminal of the power supply 18 in any known manner. The plates 30 may be formed from any suitable electrically conductive material known in the art, such as lead and lead alloys, platinum and stainless steel, which is also inert to the cleaning solution 16.Cleaning may be effected when using a NaOH solution by applying an electrolysis current density of about 1.0 mA cm2 to about 500 mA cm2, preferably from about 25 mA cm2 to about 2 200 mA cm , to the anode plates 30 and the foil 10. While it is preferred to cathodically clean the foil 10, the electrical polarity can be reversed and the foil 10 may be cleaned anodically with similar results. Alternatively, acid cleaning of the foil 10 may be used in lieu of caustic cleaning. After being cleaned, the foil 10 passes over exit roller 32 and through a rinse station 34. If desired, the foil 10 may pass through a bank of air nozzles not shown prior to exiting the tank 14 to prevent carryover of excess cleaning solution. In the rinse station, a fluid such as water is sprayed over the foil 10. The action of the fluid spray removes any loose particles on the foil and washes away unwanted chemicals left by the caustic cleaning solution. The incorporation of a rinse station at this point of the processing line is also desirable from the standpoint that downstream chemical solutions will not be contaminated by the chemicals in the caustic cleaning solution. The rinse station will be described more fully hereinafter. After rinsing, the foil 10 is subjected to a treatment for rendering its surface s more uniformly electrochemically active and receptive to subsequent electrochemical treatment. It has been found that by performing this treatment the number of bare spots or unplated regions present on the treated surface of the foil 10 after a dendritic treatment has been applied may be significantly reduced. The import of this is that when the treated foil is eventually laminated to a substrate material fewer regions of poor adhesion are present and the bond between the treated foil and the substrate material is materially stronger. The treatment applied to the foil 10 for rendering the surfaces more uniformly active preferably comprises electrodeposition of a very thin, substantially uniform layer of copper on each surface to be treated. It has been discovered that good adhesive and dendritic plating coverage results can be obtained by plating the foil surface s with a copper layer having a thickness in the range of about .01 to 1.0cm. In a preferred embodiment, the plated layer has a thickness of from about 0.1 to about 0.5 Um. This copper layer or copper strike may be formed by passing the foil 10 over roller 36 and into the electrolyte solution 38 in treatment tank 40. The foil 10 is again rendered cathodic by electrically connecting it to the negative terminal of a power supply.The power supply may be the same as that used in the previous cleaning step or may be a separate power supply 50.The foil 10 may be connected to the power supply in any suitable manner such as by contact with one or more electrically conductive rollers. If a separate power supply is used, the power supply 50 may comprise any suitable DC or AC power supply known in the art. The tank 40 may be provided with a plurality of rollers such as rollers 36, 42, 44 and 46 arranged to make the foil 10 loop through the electrolyte solution 38 in a desired manner.Preferably, a plurality of anodes or anode plates 48 are immersed in the electrolyte solution 38. The anodes or anode plates may be electricÅally connected to the positive terminal of whatever power supply is being used to apply the cathodic current to the foil 10. The anodes or anode plates may be connected to the power supply being used in any suitable manner known in the art. In addition, the anodes or anode plates 48 may be formed from either consumable materials such as copper or formed from or surfaced with non consumable metals and metal oxides including platinum, lead and lead alloys such as Pb 6 Sb. When metals such as lead and lead alloys are used, it is desirable to bag each anode or anode plate 48 to prevent particulate from contaminating the electrolyte solution.The anodes or anode plates 48 are preferably mounted in the tank 40 in vertical planes parallel to the foil surface. Any suitable means known in the art may be used to mount the anodes or anode plates 48 in the tank 40. When treating copper base foil materials, the electrolyte solution 38 used to form the copper strike layer preferably comprises an aqueous copper sulfate sulfuric acid solution having a composition identical to that of the solution to be used during the dendritic treatment stage. When plating the copper layer from such a CuSO4 H2SO4 electrolyte solution, the temperature of the solution may be maintained substantially at room temperature to facilitate ease of use. To obtain satisfactory plating, it is desirable to have the concentration of copper in the solution be high enough to perform the process efficiently, yet be below the point at which the copper precipitates out as copper sulfate.At substantially room temperature, the electrolyte solution 19 preferably has a concentration of copper, in the form of copper sulfate, of from about 15 g l to a saturation concentration of about 60 g l. Below a copper concentration of 15 g l, the limiting current becomes too low to reasonably perform the plating process. Above the saturation point, copper sulfate precipitates out and it becomes substantially impossible to get more copper into the solution. In a most preferred embodiment of the present invention, the concentration of copper in the CuSO4 H2SO4 electrolyte solution maintained substantially at room temperature is in the range of about 15 g l to about 40 g l. Sulfuric acid may be present in the Cu 504 H2 504 electrolyte solution in a concentration up to that which causes copper to precipitate out as copper sulfate. Preferably, the sulfuric acj concentration is in the range of about 10 g l 60 about 100 g l for a CuSO4 H2 SO4 solution maii ta aed substantially at room temperature. While the electrolytic solution may be used at substantially room temperature, it is also possible to plate the copper layer from a CuSO4 H2 SO4 solution maintained at an elevated temperature. The copper and sulfuric acid concentrations discussed above are temperature dependent and may have to be adjusted when the solution is kept at a temperature other than substantially room temperature. At elevated temperatures, the concentration of copper could be proportionately higher since the solubility limit increases with temperature. To use an electrolyte at an elevated temperature, the cell 18 may be provided with any suitable means known in the art not shown for maintaining the electrolyte 19 at the desired temperature level. It has been found that the desired copper plating or strike layer may be formed from the aforementioned CuSO4 H2 504 solution by applying a current density in the range of about 5 mA cm2 to about the limiting current density of the electrolyte solution. Suitable residence or deposition times have been found to be those in the range of at least about 5 sec. up to the time needed to form the maximum thickness of the plating layer at a given current density. Preferably, the plating layer is formed by applying a current density in the range of about 5 mA cm2 to about 25 mA cm2 for a time in the range of about 5 sec. to about 2 minutes. Maintaining the electrolyte solution at an elevated temperature, allows the plating of the copper strike layer at a faster speed by using a higher current density. While it is preferred to form the thin copper strike layer on the foil 10 in the aforesaid manner, light electrochemical etching of the foil surface may be employed in lieu of the plating treatment to render the surface more uniformly electrochemically active. The etching treatment may be carried out in any desired manner using any suitable etching technique and solution known in the art. Alternatively, the thin copper strike layer may be formed by forming a substantially uniform oxide layer on the surface or surfaces to be treated and chemically changing the oxide layer to a substantially uniform layer of fresh metal on the surface or surfaces.While good results can be obtained by forming an oxide layer having a thickness in the range of about 0.01 p m to about 1.0 pm, it is preferred to form an oxide layer having a thickness in the range of about 0.1 y mto about 0.3 pm on each surface to be treated. Because of the manner in which the oxide layer is formed, it is not necessary to clean degrease the material prior to this treatment. Referring now to the Figure 5, copper or copper alloy sheet, strip, or foil 10 in a wrought or as rolled condition is payed off a reel not shown and immersed in an alkaline cleaning solution 312. When treating copper or copper alloy materials, the alkaline solution preferably comprises an aqueous NaOH solution containing from about 3 to about 30 NaOH, most preferably from about 8 to about 15 NaOH. While the solution may have a temperature in the range from about room temperature to about the boiling temperature of the solution, the solution temperature is preferably within the range of about 250C to about 600C. When the solution 312 is used at a temperature other than room temperature, the tank 318 may be provided with any suitable temperature maintenance and control means not shown known in the art. A substantially uniform layer of cuprous oxide having the desired thickness is preferably formed on each surface to be treated by passing an anodic current through the immersed foil. A current source 314 for supplying the current and one or more cathodes 316 immersed in the solution 312 may be provided in a known manner. The current source 314 may comprise any suitable current supply known in the art. Similarly, the cathode or cathodes 316 may be formed from any suitable metal or metal alloy known in the art. Suitable current densities for forming the oxide layer are those up to about .100 mA cm2. Preferably, a current density in the range of about 10 mA cm2 to about 40 mA cm2 is used to form the oxide layer. The exposure or deposition time required to produce the desired oxide layer is a function of the applied current density.Generally, the higher the current density, the lower the exposure time required. Suitable exposure times are those in the range of about 15 seconds to about 2 minutes, preferably from about 15 seconds to about 1 minute. As a result of the oxide layer forming treatment, the copper or copper alloy foil 10 tends to turn dark in color. Before applying the next treatment, it is desirable to rinse off any excess NaOH from the foil 10. This may be done using any suitable washing apparatus 320 known in the art. For example, the apparatus 320 may comprise a water rinse through which the foil 10 and the newly formed oxide layer pass. After being washed, the foil 10 and its oxide layer may be dried using any suitable drying means not shown known in the art. It is believed that this treatment reduces the number of bare spots or unplated regions because a fresh metal layer is provided on each surface to be treated. The fresh metal layer is believed to render the surface more uniformly electrochemically active and more receptive to subsequent electrolytic treatments such as electrodepositing dendrites on the surface. To form the fresh metal layer, the foil 10 and the oxide layer formed thereon are preferably immersed in a mineral acid solution 322. A preferred mineral acid solution for treating copper and copper alloy materials comprises a sulfuric acid solution. The solution may be an aqueous sulfuric acid solution having a sulfuric acid concentration of at least about 0.1 or it may be a concentrated sulfuric acid solution.Preferably, the solution comprises an aqueous sulfuric acid having a sulfuric acid concentration in the range of about 1 to about 10 . When the copper or copper alloy foil 10 is immersed in such an acid solution, it reverts back to its pink color. This is due to the reaction of the cuprous oxide with the sulfuric acid. During this reaction, a part of the copper in the cuprous oxide goes into solution and a part of it is deposited as fresh copper on the foil surface.Since the cuprous oxide layer is substantially uniform, the fresh copper layer should also be substantially uniform. While it is preferred to immerse the foil 10 in a mineral acid solution 322 at room temperature, a solution having a temperature other than room temperature may also be used. When a solution at another temperature is used, the tank 324 may be provided with suitable means not shown for maintaining the temperature of the solution at the desired level. While it is preferred to electrolytically form the aforementioned oxide layer, the oxide layer may also be formed non electrolytically by immersion of the material to be treated in an alkaline cleaning solution for a time sufficient to create the desired oxide layer. Of course, the residence time needed to form such an oxide layer would be increased. Alternatively, the thin copper layer may be formed using a pulse plating technique. While the copper strike layer is still fresh, the foil 10 is passed from the treatment tank 40 or 324 to the treatment tank 52 where a dendritic treatment is applied to the foil. The dendritic treatment comprises electrodeposition of a plurality of dendritic structures on at least one surface of the foil 10 and bonding of the dendritic structures thereto. The specific technique for forming the dendritic structures and for bonding them to the foil surface s is more fully described in U.S. Patent No. 4,468,293 to Polan et al. To perform this dendritic treatment, the foil 10 is passed through an electrolyte solution 54 and rendered cathodic such as by contacting one or more conductive rollers electrically connected to the negative terminal of a power source 55. The foil 10 may be passed through the solution 54 in any suitable manner such as by rollers 56, 58, 60 and 62. As previously mentioned, the solution 54 preferably has the same composition as the solution 38. In a preferred manner of performing the foil treatment described herein, the temperature of the solution 54, however, is kept lower than the temperature of the solution 38. The reason for doing this is related to the line speed requirements for the processing line. To maintain a desired substantially constant line speed throughout the system, it has been found to be necessary, to apply a current density to the foil 10 and the solution 38 in the copper strike layer treatment tank 40 greater than that allowed by operating at the temperature of the solution 54.This is done to increase the amount of copper being plated in the treatment tank 40 for a given period of time. Since the solution 38 ideally has the same composition as the solution 54, its limiting current density has to be raised to prevent formation of dendritic structures in the tank 40 while effecting the required plating. Raising the limiting current density of the solution 38 is preferably done by maintaining the solution 38 at a higher temperature than the solution 54.It has been found that keeping the temperature of the solution 38 at a temperature in the range of slightly above room temperature to about the boiling temperature of the solution, preferably at 0 a temperature in the range of about 40 C to about 600C, while at the same time maintaining the temperature of the solution 54 at a temperature in the range of about room temperature to about 60 C, preferably from about room temperature to about 400C , produces the desired results. The tanks 40 and 52 may be provided with any suitable temperature maintenance and control devices not shown known in the art to keep the solutions 38 and 54 at the desired temperatures. After the dendritic treatment has been applied, the foil 10 is passed through a rinse station 64. If desired, the foil 10 may be passed through a bank of air nozzles not shown prior to exiting the tank 52 to prevent the carryover of excess plating solution. The rinse station 64 sprays a fluid such as water over the foil surfaces to remove any loose particles on the surfaces and wash away unwanted chemicals left by the electrolyte solutions 38 and 54. The incorporation of a rinse station at this point is again desirable from the viewpoint of preventing the contamination of the subsequent treatment bath. The rinse station 64 will also be discussed in more detail hereinafter. To demonstrate the present invention, the following examples were performed. EXAMPLE I A strip of copper alloy C11000 in an as rolled condition was first cleaned in an aqueous 3 NaOH 0 solution at 60 C. After cleaning and rinsing, a copper strike layer having xa thickness of 0.2Pm was deposited from an electrolyte containing 20 g lCu and 45 g l H2SO4 using a current density of 10 mA cm2 and a deposition time of 60 sec. The plating treatment was performed in an electrochemical cell having a Pb 6 Sb anode and the foil as the cathode. After plating, a uniform substantially defect free dendritic layer having of thickness of about 1.0 Pm was formed using the same electrolyte and the same cell as used in the plating step. During the dendritic treatment, a current density of 100 mA cm2 was applied for a time of about 8 seconds. The foil treated in accordance with the above technique exhibited bare areas over less than 18 of the total foil surface area. In comparison, a commercially treated foil exhibited bare areas over more than 10 of the total foil surface area. The bare areas on this commercially treated foil generally take the form of 2 5 P m wide by 25 300 Pm long, shiny, dendrite free stripes. EXAMPLE II A 2 oz. ft2 copper alloy C11000 foil sample in an as rolled condition was immersed in an aqueous alkaline solution containing 10 NaOH at 600C. A black oxide layer was formed on the foil by applying an anodic current having a current density of 20 mA cm2 for 60 seconds. The foil was then immersed in an acid solution for 5 seconds to change the oxide layer to a layer of freshly deposited copper. The acid solution was at room temperature and had a copper concentration of 20 g l and a sulfuric acid concentration of 45 g l. After immersion in the acid solution, dendrites were formed on the foil by immersing the foil in the same acid solution and applying a fluctuating plating current having a frequency of about 20 Hz. for 9 seconds. The plating current had a 50 duty cycle with a peak current density of 240 mA cm2 and a minimum current density of 40 mA cm2. The treated foil was found to be substantially uniformly plated with few or no unplated spots or streaks. The unplated spots streaks covered less than 18 of the total foil surface. EXAMPLE III A 2 oz. ft2 copper alloy C11000 foil sample was immersed in an aqueous alkaline solution containing 30 NaOH at 45 C. An anodic current 2 having a current density of 40 mA cm was applied to the foil for 30 seconds. A dark oxide layer was formed on the foil surface. The foil was then subjected to immersion in the same acid solution as used in Example II for 5 seconds and to the same dendritic treatment as in Example II. Again, the trated foil exhibited uniformity in the plated layer and a substantial absence of plating defects.The number of bare spots and unplated regions again covered less than 1 of the total foil surface area. The final treatment to which the foil 10 is preferably subjected is an anti tarnishing treatment. The anti tarnishing treatment is needed because dendritic copper surfaces are highly susceptible to atmospheric corrosion. If allowed to remain wet after production, dendritic copper foil will turn dark within minutes. Even if it is dried immediately, the dendritic copper foil will tarnish within days. This tarnishing is the result of the formation of a surface oxide layer. The surface oxide layer develops rapidly because of the dendritic copper s high surface area and the high chemical activity of freshly plated metal. In the anti tarnishing treatment tank 66, the foil 10 is coated with a thin film that prevents tarnishing. The anti tarnishing solution in the tank 66 may be any of many commercially available solutions such as a chromic acid solution. It is desirable to maintain the anti tarnishing solution at an elevated temperature in the range of slightly above room temperature to about 800C to obtain good anti tarnishing results. To this end, the tank 66 may be provided with suitable temperature maintenance and control devices not shown. The temperature maintenance and control device used may comprise any suitable temperature maintenance and control device known in the art. After the anti tarnishing treatment has been applied, the foil 10 may be passed through another rinse station 68. The rinse station 68 may be identical in construction to the rinse stations 34 and 64. It has been found to be desirable for the design of the various rinse stations to incorporate the following consideration. The foil in the rinse area or areas because of its fragile nature needs to be closely supported by having short spans between adjacent rollers over which and through which the foil travels. A rinse that will be flowed could be used instead of the spray. Applying the aforementioned consideration, each of the rinse stations 34, 64 and 68 preferably has a plurality of spray nozzles not shown arranged about the periphery of the foil to spray fluid onto both sides of the foil 10. While the spray nozzles may be arranged in any suitable configuration and may have any desired nozzle pattern, it is preferred that the spray nozzles be arranged in banks of adjacent square pattern nozzles on opposed sides of the foil 10. Before the treated foil is coiled on a take up reel not shown, it may be dried. Numerous drying processes which may be used are known in the art.One such process which may be used embodies a water blow off stage followed by a hot air tunnel drying stage. An alternative process which may be used utilizes heated blow off air for both bulk and evaporative water removal. In this latter process, the hot air can be directed against the foil when it is lying on drum rollers in the line. In still other alternative processes, at least one internally heated drum roller or infra red heating may be used to dry the foil. The drying station 70 may incorporate any of these drying processes. After the treatment of the present invention has been completed, the treated foil 10 may be laminated to a substrate material such as a resinous or other synthetic polymer material. Any suitable lamination technique and or adhesive known in the art may be used. To consistently produce treated foil of superior quality, it is believed that three things are necessary. First, the solution in each treatment tank must be continually conditioned to remove undesirable particulates, chemical impurities and residual grease and oil that can adversely affect the quality of the treated foil.Second, treatment temperatures must be maintained at substantially constant values. Third, the concentration of chemicals in each solution must be maintained at a substantially constant level. To this end, a dual filtration system and a solution replenishment system are associated with each of the treatment tanks 14, 40, 52 and 66. Referring now to Figure 2, each treatment tank has a solution conditioning loop 72 associated with it. This solution conditioning loop forms one leg of the dual filtration system associated with each treatment tank. Each solution conditioning loop 72 comprises conduits 74 and 80 for withdrawing solution from and returning solution to the treatment tank, a pump 76 for circulating the solution through the conduits, and a filter 78 for conditioning the solution. While it is preferred to continually withdraw solution from each treatment tank and condition it through the loop 72, appropriate valve means not shown may be incorporated into the loop 72 to control the amount of solution being withdrawn at a given moment. The pump and the valve means may comprise any suitable pump and valve arrangement known in the art. The filter 78 is primarily used to remove particulate and other impurities, suspended or unsuspended, from the solution. In some situations, it may be desirable for the filter to also be capable of removing organic contaminants that may be carried over from previous bath solutions or may have come from the atmosphere. While any filter known in the art capable of removing these materials from the solutions may be used, it is preferred to use commercially available polypropylene cartridge type filters for the filters 78. Where it is necessary to change the temperature of the withdrawn solution either to promote filtration or to provide solution at a desired temperature back to the treatment tank, a heat exchanger 82 may be incorporated into the conditioning loop. Any suitable conventional heat exchanger known in the art may be incorporated into the conditioning loop. The second leg of the dual filtration system of the present system comprises means for removing surface impurities and contaminants from the various treatment baths. To this end, each treatment tank may be provided with a floating skimmer 81. Any suitable skimmer known in the art may be used to remove surface impurities and contaminants. The skimmer discharge may be connected to any suitable means for removing the surface impurities and the contaminants. For example, the skimmer discharge may be connected to the suction side of the conditioning loop pump 76 by appropriate conduits and valves. By providing such an arrangement, the solution removed by the surface skimmer could be passed through the filter 78 and returned to the tank by conduit 80. In addition to or in lieu of the skimmer 81, a solution overflow system that removes solution above a desired level from the tank may be employed to remove the surface impurities or contaminants from each treatment tank. The solution overflow system may comprise any suitable arrangement of conduits, pump, valves and filters for removing solution above the desired level and the surface impurities and contaminants. In a preferred embodiment, the solution overflow system forms part of a solution replenishment filtration loop associated with each treatment tank. While the components forming each conditioning loop 72 are essentially the same for each treatment tank, the components making up the solution replenishment f iltration loop for each treatment tank differ.This difference is a reflection of the different requirements associated with each treatment solution such as the different compositions of the solutions and or the different impurities and contaminants which may be encountered during solution replenishment and filtration. The solution replenishment filtration loop 84 for the caustic cleaning solution preferably includes an off line solution preparation holding tank 86 and a conduit network 88 for withdrawing contaminated and or depleted solution from and for providing fresh cleaning solution to the tank 14.The off line tank 86 may have one or more inlets 90 and 92 through which the chemicals needed to form the desired cleaning solution may be introduced. If needed, the tank may be provided with a stirrer 94 to mix the chemicals together and a heating cooling means not shown for providing fresh cleaning solution at a desired temperature. The stirrer and the heating cooling means may comprise any suitable stirring and heating cooling devices known in the art. The conduit network 88 preferably has a pump 96 and one or more valves 98. The valves 98 may be used to withdraw the solution and replace it as a batch. The valves could be operated automatically or manually in response to a sensed condition of the cleaning solution 16. For example, the solution 16 may be withdrawn from the tank 14 when the operator visually sees unemulsified oils on the surface of the solution, when the foil exiting the tank exhibits a lack of wetting, and or when there are a significant number of unplated regions or spots on the treated foil. Where desired, the valves 98 may be omitted or controlled to permit continuous withdrawal of solution 16 from the tank 14 and a continuous flow of fresh solution 16 to the tank 14. As previously mentioned, continuous withdrawal of the solution may be used to effect removal of surface impurities and contaminants. With respect to the treatment of the solutions 38 and 54 in the tanks 40 and 52 respectively, a single solution replenishment filtration loop 100 may be used to treat both solutions. This is possible because they have the same chemical make up. The loop 100 has a conduit network 104 for withdrawing solution from and providing fresh solution to the tanks 40 and 52 and an off line tank 102 for receiving withdrawn depleted solution to be reconditioned. In addition to the receiving reconditioning tank 102, the system 100 may include an off line solution holding tank 116 for storing reconditioned solution to be provided to the treatment tanks. The conduit network 104 preferably comprises one or more pumps 106 and a plurality of valves 108 associated with the various conduit lines forming the network 104. The pump and valves may be any conventional pump and valves known in the art. To recondition the solution from either treatment tank 40 or 52, the withdrawn and or depleted solution enters the tank 102 through the inlet 110. When copper sulfate sulfuric acid solutions are used as the treatment baths 38 and 50, the solution reconditioning problem centers about restoration of the copper and sulfuric acid concentrations. During the copper strike and dendritic treatments, the copper concentration in the solutions 38 and 54 decreases. This is due to the fact that copper is being removed from the solution to be plated or deposited onto the foil 10. At the same time, the sulfuric acid concentration in the solutions increases because sulfuric acid is generated by electrolysis of the bath solution. The concentration of copper and sulfuric acid in the withdrawn solution must be returned to the desired concentration levels in order for the solution to be reusable.Generally, there are two techniques available to return the copper and sulfuric acid concentrations to the desired levels these are replenishment of the copper values by adding copper salts to the depleted withdrawn solution or replenishment of the copper values by digestion of metallic copper. In small systems, the preferred approach to replenishing the copper values is to use copper salts. The copper and sulfuric acid concentrations may be restored to the desired levels by dissolving copper or a copper salt such as cupric oxide or cupric carbonate in the withdrawn solution in the tank 102. The copper salt is preferably supplied to the tank 102 through the inlet 112. The dissolution of the salt into the withdrawn depleted solution proceeds to neutralize some of the sulfuric acid by forming copper sulfate with the electrolytically produced sulfuric acid. The formation of the copper sulfate returns the sulfuric acid concentration to the desired level and provides the solution with fresh copper values that may be plated or deposited onto the foil. The advantage of this technique is that there is no need to remove acid values as an insoluble compound via a filtration operation. A stirrer 91 may be provided in the tank 102 to mix the materials in the tank. If needed, a heating cooling loop not shown may also be provided within the tank. The stirrer and the heating cooling loop may comprise any conventional stirrer and heating cooling loop known in the art. In a preferred embodiment, a plurality of filters 120 and 121 are incorporated into the system 100. The filters 120 and 121 are used to remove contaminants such as unwanted chemicals, organic materials, grease, oil and particulate that may be present in the withdrawn solution and or may have entered the reconditioned solution during the reconditioning process. While any suitable filters known in the art may be used for filters 120 and 121, it is preferred to use a horizontal plate filter for filter 121 and a polypropylene cartridge filter for filter 120. To assist removal of carbonaceous materials, e.g. active carbon deliberately added for purification of the solution, from the depleted withdrawn solution, a filtering aid such as diatomaceous earth may be incorporated into the tank 102. If desired, a filter aid slurry preparation tank 103 may also be provided. Where the solutions 38 and 54 contain a surfactant such as lauryl sulfate or sodium dihexyl sulfosuccinate to assist in plating and which needs to be replenished, the loop 100 may be provided with appropriate means for adding surfactant to the solution being returned to the tanks 40 and 52.For example, the loop 100 may be provided with a surfactant feed tank 119, a pump 106 and appropriate conduits. The solution in either treatment tank 40 or 52 may be withdrawn either in a batchwise fashion or in a continuous fashion. When removed in a batchwise fashion, removal may be in response to a sensed condition of the solution. For example, solution may be withdrawn when analytical analysis of the solution shows that the copper concentration has decreased by a certain percentage. Continuous removal of the solution in the treatment tanks 40 and 52 may be used to remove surface contaminants such as grease and oil floating on the surface of the solution. As previously mentioned when continuous removal of solution is used to remove surface contaminants, an overflow arrangement such as a solution overflow pipe not shown may be incorporated into the loop 100. The solution replenishment f iltration loop 122 associated with the anti tarnishing treatment tank 66 includes an off line solution preparation holding tank 124 and a conduit network 126 for withdrawing depleted solution from and for providing fresh solution to the treatment tank 66.The tank 124 may have one or more inlets 128 through which the chemicals needed to replenish the anti tarnishing solution may be introduced into the tank 124. The tank 124 may be provided with a stirrer 130 to mix the chemicals together and a heating cooling loop not shown for providing fresh solution at a desired temperature. The stirrer and the heating cooling loop may comprise any conventional stirrer and heating cooling loop known in the art. The conduit network 126 preferably includes a pump 132 and one or more valves 136. The valve s may be operated to withdraw depleted solution from and provide fresh solution to the tank 66 in a batchwise fashion in response to a sensed condition of the solution such as the chromate ion concentration in the solution. The valve s 136 may be operated automatically or manually. If desired, the valve s 136 may be operated to substantially continuously withdraw solution from the tank 66 and replace it with fresh solution. When a continuous solution withdrawal feed system is used, the treatment tank 66 is preferably provided with an overflow capability such as an overflow pipe in order to provide removal of surface contaminants.If needed, a filter 134 may be incorporated into the network 126. The filter 134 should be of the type that will remove particulate matter such as dust and atmospheric debris, grease and or oil from the solution being supplied to the tank 66. Any suitable filter known in the art for removing such contaminants and impurities may be used for the filter 134. While any suitable fluid may be sprayed on the foil by the rinse stations 34, 64 and 68 to remove loose particles and wash away unwanted chemical contaminants, it is preferred to use de ionized water. To this end, the metal treatment system shown in Figure 2 may be provided with a source of de ionized water 138 and a conduit network for transferring the water to and from the various rinsing stations. If desired, each rinsing station may have a water recycling loop 140 associated with it. Each water recycling loop 140 preferably includes a surge tank or a sump 142, a pump 144 and conduits 146 to remove water from and provide water to the rinse station. If needed, de ionized water from the source 138 may be transferred to one or more of the off line solution preparation tanks 86, 102 and or 124 to assist in preparation of fresh solution.Appropriate conduits may be provided to transfer the water from the source 138 to the tank s 86, 102 and or 124. Referring now to Figure 3, a system 200 for producing electrodeposited metal foil is illustrated. The system 200 includes a tank 202 containing an electrolyte solution 204, an anode 206 and a cathode 208. The anode 206 and the cathode 208 may be electrically connected to a power source 210 in any desired manner. The power source 210 may comprise any suitable power supply known in the art such as a DC power supply. The cathode 208 preferably comprises a rotating drum having a relatively smooth plating surface 212 at least partially immersed in the electrolyte solution. The anode 206 preferably has an arcuate configuration and is mounted in the tank 202 so that it is substantially concentric with the rotation axis of the drum cathode.In addition, the anode preferably has a central perforated zone through which electrolyte is pumped by a pump 214 into a manifold 216 and into the gap 218 between the anode and the cathode. The electrolyte solution 204 generally comprises an acidic solution containing a concentration of metal ions to be plated onto the cathode plating surface 212. For forming electrodeposited copper foil, the solution 204 preferably comprises a copper sulfate sulfuric acid solution. In operation, the cathode 208 is rotated at a desired speed and a current having a suitable current density is applied between the cathode 208 and the anode 206. The electrolyte is circulated upward through the manifold 216 into the interelectrode gap 218 and permitted to spill over the edges of the anode 206 back into the tank 202. While the plating surface 212 is immersed in the electrolyte and a current is being applied, metal is deposited thereon. The metal deposit generally takes the form of a relatively thin, relatively smooth, continuous strip of metal foil 220. After the plating surface emerges from the electrolyte, the metal foil is removed or peeled from the surface. Any suitable means 222 known in the art may be used to remove the foil from the plating surface. For example, the metal foil may be removed using one of the peeling devices illustrated inU.S. Patent Nos. 2,865,830 to Zoldas and 3,461,046 to Clancy. As previously mentioned, one of the main impediments to consistently producing electrodeposited foil of superior quality is the presence of impurities in the electrolyte bath 204.To remove unwanted impurities, a dual solution filtration system is associated with the processing tank 202. The dual filtration system comprises a solution conditioning loop 224 to primarily remove particulate matter from the solution and a means for removing surface contaminants from the solution. The solution conditioning loop 224 preferably comprises a conduit 228 for withdrawing solution from the tank 202, a pump 230, a filter 232 and a return conduit 234 for returning solution to the tank 202. Where the solution temperature has to be modified either to assist in the filtration process and or to return solution at a particular temperature to the tank 202, a heat exchanger 236 may be incorporated into the loop 224. The heat exchanger 236 may comprise any suitable heat exchanger known in the art. The filter 232 may comprise any suitable filter known in the art for removing particulate matter such as organic debris from the atmosphere and other unwanted impurities.Cartridge type filters such as polypropylene cartridge filters appear to have particular utility in such a conditioning loop. To remove surface contaminants and or impurities such as greases and oils, the tank 202 may be provided with a skimmer 238 that floats on the surface of the solution 204. As before, the skimmer may comprise any suitable skimmer known in the art. Its discharge may be connected to the suction side of the pump 230 so that solution removed from the tank by the skimmer 238 passes through the filter 232. In lieu of or in addition to the skimmer 238, surface impurities and or contaminants may be removed by causing solution to be continuously withdrawn from the tank 202 and passed through a solution replenishment filtration loop 226. The solution replenishment filtration loop 226 preferably comprises a network of conduits 240, a pump 242 for circulating solution through the conduits, a filter 244 and an off line solution replenishment and holding tank 246. To remove surface impurities, the conduit network 240 may include an overflow pipe for removing solution above a desired level. Any suitable technique known in the art may be used to replenish the metal values in the withdrawn depleted solution.For example, any suitable elemental digestion system 248 known in the art such as a scrap wire digestion system may be used to replenish the copper values in a copper sulfate sulfuric acid electrolyte solution. The filter 244 may comprise any suitable filter known in the art such as a cartridge type filter capable of removing the impurities and or contaminants generally associated with the withdrawn electrolyte solution and the particular replenishment technique employed. If desired, the loop 226 may also include a heat exchanger 250. The heat exchanger may comprise any suitable heat exchanger known in the art and may be used to assist in the filtration of the solution or to provide solution at a desired temperature. While a system for producing electrodeposited foil has been illustrated in Figure 3, it should be recognized that the foil produced by the system 200 may be subjected to other treatments. For example, the foil may be subjected to an anti tarnishing treatment after it leaves the tank 202.Alternatively, the electrodeposited foil may be subjected to the treatments illustrated in Figure 1. Another consideration which has been found to be important to the production of superior quality foil has to do with the handling of the foil during processing. During processing, the foil 10 passes over and comes into contact with a plurality of rollers. It has been found that these rollers must be carefully aligned to avoid damage to the relatively thin, delicate foil 10. The present systems preferably have incorporated therein an alignment system 150 capable of setting the rollers and the roll axis of each roller in a desired manner that enables the foil to accurately track through the system. Referring now to Figure 4, the alignment system 150 performs alignment of the rolls by tracking a beam 152 of light parallel to the direction 151 of movement of the foil through the processing line or system and using an optically set square and parallel ruler as references for aligning the rollers. The alignment system 150 has a reference frame such as a horizontal track optical bench 154 extending the entire length of the particular processing or treatment line. The bench or frame 154 has a longitudinal axis parallel to the foil movement direction. Mounted to the bench 154 is a trolley 156 that is free to move along the entire length of the bench. The trolley 156 may be provided with rollers 158 or other equivalent devices for permitting movement along the bench. The reference light beam 152 is formed by mounting a source of light such as a laser beam generator 160 to the trolley 156 in any suitable manner. The generator 160 is mounted to the trolley 156 so that the reference beam 152 is formed parallel to the foil movement direction through the processing and or treatment tanks. The laser beam generator 160 may comprise any suitable laser beam generator known in the art such as a one milliwatt helium neon red laser beam generator. In addition to the laser beam generator, a beam splitter 162 is mounted to the trolley 156.The beam splitter 162 preferably comprises an optical device for redirecting a first portion 164 of the light beam produced by the generator 160 at 0 an angle of 90 to the longitudinal axis of the bench 154 and for permitting a second portion of the beam produced by the generator to pass through and form the reference beam 152. The beam splitter may be mounted to the trolley in any suitable manner. The redirected portion 164 of the light beam is what is used to align each of the rollers in two planes. Generation of the roller alignment beams is done by mounting a beam splitter 166 and a mirror 168 to an arm 170 mounted to the trolley 156. The arm 170 is mounted to the trolley 156 so that it is perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the bench. The beam splitter 166 and the mirror 168 are preferably mounted to the arm 170 in a manner that enables them to slide along the frame. Any suitable sliding means 172 and 174.known in the art may be used to mount the beam splitter 166 and the mirror 168 to the arm 170. The beam splitter 166 splits the beam 164 into two portions 176 and 178. Any suitable optical device known in the art such as a half silvered mirror may be used to split the beam 164 into the two desired portions. The first beam portion 176 extends parallel to the reference beam 152 and is used to align the sidewalls of the rollers in a plane parallel to the reference beam. Figure 4 illustrates a plurality of rollers 180 and 182 having sidewalls 184 aligned by the beam 176. The second beam portion 178 is used to align the roll axis of each roller. This is done by redirecting the beam 178 in a perpendicular direction 185. Preferably, an optical device 168 such as a mirror is used to redirect the beam 178.The redirected beam 185 is then focused onto a series of targets 188 on the axles 190 of the rollers. By aligning the targets on both sides of each roller, the roll axis of each roller may be aligned to be perpendicular to the reference beam. The provision of the trolley 156 enables each roller to be individually aligned. Similarly, the provision of sliding means 172 and 174 for beam splitter 166 and mirror 168 enables alignment of both sides of each roller. While the optical alignment system has been described as having a horizontal reference frame, a plurality of stands aligned in a direction parallel to the direction of foil travel could be used in lieu of the frame 154. When using such an arrangement, the trolley 156 may be replaced by any suitable support structure for mounting the laser beam generator and optical alignment devices to each stand. In accordance with the foregoing description, a system for producing metal foil of superior quality has been described. Using this system, treated foil surfaces have been obtained with better and more reproducible properties than are currently available on wrought copper printed circuit foil. While the foil treatment system of the present invention has been described as applying an anti tarnishing treatment after the dendritic treatment, additional non copper metal electrodeposition stages with appropriate off line support may be provided intermediate the dendritic treatment stage and the anti tarnishing composition application stage. While a single replenishment filtration loop 100 for treating the solutions 38 and 54 in tanks 40 and 52, respectively, has been illustrated inFigure 2, each of the treatment tanks may be provided with individual solution replenishment filtration loops if so desired. While the invention has been described in the context of treating one surface of the foil 10, It is possible to treat a plurality of foil surfaces if so desired. When treating more than one surface, however, the various electrochemical cells may have to be provided with a plurality of anodes on more than one side of the foil. As previously mentioned, the technique of the present invention has greater applicability than just treating copper and copper alloy foils. When applying the present invention to metal or metal alloy materials other than copper or copper alloy materials, the various operational parameters such as the composition of the electrolyte solutions, the concentrations of the metal or metals in the electrolyte solutions, the temperatures of the electrolyte solutions, the applied current densities and the deposition or residence times may have to be adjusted accordingly. It is apparent that there has been provided in accordance with this invention systems for producing electroplated and or treated metal foil which fully satisfy the objects, means and advantages set forth hereinbefore. While the invention has been described in combination with specific embodiments thereof, it is evident that many alternatives, modifications and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art in light of the foregoing description. Accordingly, it is intended to cover all such alternatives, modifications, and variations as fall within the spirit and broad scope of the appended claims.
