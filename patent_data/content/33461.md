## Description
A ROTARY HANK HOLDING SUPPORT AND HANK TRANSFER SYSTEMWITH CAM ALIGNMENT .In systems or plants for treating hank yearns, the hanks as wetted upon some operation, such as dyeing, involving a contact situation with a liquid have to be dried, and this is effected in dryers in which such hanks are translated as supported on hank holding supports hank carriers , in turn carried by a moving endless chain. The hank carriers have an arm for connection to the endless chain, and an arm or base for supporting the hank which is threaded or carried thereon. It is convenient that the wetted hank should not always bear by the same zone on said base, but that the bearing zone should vary both to promote an even drying of the yarn through out the hank, and to promote an even colouring for the yarn otherwise, the dye could collect in a larger amount within the pocket formed at the bottom in the hanks .For the above mentioned former purpose, hank carriers have been since long known, the supporting base of which is of the so called cage type, that is formed by a plurality of rods spaced apart from and integral with one another, just to make up a kind of cage and said cage base can rotate about its own axis.In some earlier patents, cage hank carriers have been disclosed, in which the cage base is rotatably supported about its own axis within a seat which, in turn, is carried on a supporting and connecting arm to the chain, so as to rotate about an axis perpendicular to the arm and base plane the horizontality or, if desired, a particular inclination or slope for the cage base was ensured by a counterweight on the base as calculated on the average weight of the hank to be transferred or transported.The capability of oscillation for the base permitted the extraction or removal of the hank therefrom by fall, when required. Such devices of the prior art have been used in some case in the past years, when the average weight of the hanks being treated was of about 200 g and accordingly the overall space of the counterweights was limited.However, as a result of various factors, it was found convenient td treat at a same tine hanks, or groups of hanks, of increasing size and weight up to 5 kg and more. This would have involved an undue increase in the weight and volume of the counterweight and this would also have considerably weighed down the whole moving system, causing a premature wear of the transporting chain and sliding rail therefor. Moreover, the path for the support within a dryer develops according to a series of turns and counterturns and the overall size of the counterweights would have caused the manufacture of turns with unduly large radius in order to avoid interferences of the counterweights with one another and all of these factors involved a quite substantial burden on installation cost.With said devices of the prior art, another disadvantage resides in that the system for rotatably driving the base was often liable to failures or breakages and jammings. Therefore, in the recent years use was preferably made of not rotatable, rigid and conventional hank carriers with a stationary horizontal base, and on the other hand machines have been developed for loading and unloading the hanks relative to such hank holding supports with stationary horizontal base. However, even with such conventional supports of rigid type, there would arise serious drawbacks in treating hanks of high weight, since the rigid support would tend to become inclined under the weight, and this is particularly detrimental for cooperation with the hank loading and unloading machines requiring a correctly horizontal attitude for the base. Obviously, the conventional not rotatable supports have also the disadvantage of supporting the hanks always at the same zone.Therefore, the object was to overcome the disadvantages of the prior art and develope a rotary type of hank carrier, free of counterweight and at the same time maintaining a sufficiently reliable horizontal attitude.Thus, the hank carrier or support of the present invention was developed, which support conprises a cage base rotatable about its own axis, within a seat rigidly angularly integral with a supporting arm connected to the transporting chain, and is characterized in that a feeler or follower extension integral with the arm or rotatable base extends to engage a fixedly positioned cam for providing a desired and generally fully horizontal attitude of the support base. It is another feature of the support that a gear wheel is integral with the rotatable base for cooperation with stationary spokes, generally with a fixed chain for the rojation of the base.According to another aspect, the invention comprises a yarn transfer system, in which hank carriers as those above described and suspended from a transporting chain have a feeler extension or cam follower integral with the arm and rotatable base of the hank carriers for cooperation with fixed cam elements which are located at one or more zones along the extension of the transporting chain. According to another feature, the cam element comprises at the cam a surface for cooperation with a gear wheel for rotation of the latter preferably, said surface conprises a fixed chain, the spokes of which mesh with the teeth of the gear wheels for the supports.With respect to conventional rigid hank carriers, the novel support has the advantage of being rotatable with the improved benefits for hank drying, as above mentioned and of correct desired attitude, generally fully horizontal, at the required locations, for example, at hank loading and unloading machines. With respect to the prior art rotary hank holding supports, the novel support has the advantages of a lower weight and overall size, while being also implemented for larger loads, and correct attitude generally a perfect horizontability at the tine of member meshing for the base rotation, which ensures a reliable operation and avoids any breakage in said members.A more detailed description of the invention will now be given with reference to two presently preferred embodiments thereof, as shown in the acconpanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a side view of a first embodiment of the hank carrier or support and relevant cam element according to the present invention Fig. 2 is a sectional view taken along line 2 2 of Fig. 1 Fig. 3 is a view, as seen from the left of Fig. 1, with part of the cam element broken away for a clearer illustration of more successive hank carriers or supports, and with part of the chain broken away Fig. 4 is an enlarged view similar to Fig. 1, but partly sectioned along the axis of the support base Fig. 5 is a side view of a second embodiment of the hank carrier and relevant cam according to the present invention Fig. 6 is a view, as seen from the left of Fig. 5, with part of the cam element and part of the chain broken away, and showing a plurality of successive hank carriers andFig. 7 is an enlarged view similar to Fig. 5, partially in an axial sectional view.Referring first to Figs. 1 to 4, the novel hank carrier or support 10 comprises a base 11 and an arm 12. This base 11 is formed of four parallel rods 14 spaced apart from one another, so as to make up a kind of cage. The rods could also be in a higher or lower number than four. The rods 14 are connected at one end towards the arm by a pan or cap 16 and at the outer end or remote end from the arm by a plug or lid 18, as well as by jointing elements, such as the intermediate elements 19, where convenient. Preferably, said plug 18 has a chamfered edge 18 for assisting in hank loading or threading on said base 11. The pan or cap 16 radially projects well beyond the cage defined by said rods 14, so as to provide a stop for the loaded hanks. Said pan or cap 16 is centrally welded on a splindle 20, extending therefrom at the opposite side relative to the rods. By means of two rolling bearings 22 and 24 said spindle 20 is accomodated within the hollow of a sleeve portion 26 of said arm 12. Gaskets or packings 28 sealingly close on two sides the hollow 25 of said sleeve 26. The portion of spindle 20 projecting outwardly of sleeve 26 carries a gear wheel 29 keyed thereto, which gear wheel is secured by nfts 30. Said spindle 20 is extended beyond the portion carrying said gear wheel 29, so as to form a feeler or follower portion 32 for the purpose to be explained in the following.The sleeve portion 26 of arm 12 is connected to a bar 36 of said arm, extending for connection to the continuous transporting chain of conventional type, which has been only outlined in the figures and designated by reference numeral 38, whereas reference numeral 40 indicates a sliding rail for the transporting chain.A cam element 50 extends at fixed position along at least a section of the path for rail 40. This element 50 is formed with a top lug 52, the lower surface 52 of which is effective as a cam to engage the follower 32, conprising the end of spindle 20. At the bottom said cam element 50 forms or comprises a bearing surface 54 which in this particular case is an inverted L shaped element 56 secured by screws 58 , having secured thereon a section of a chain 60 of a type having spokes longitudinally spaced apart therealong. Said surface 54 has inclined inlet and outlet sections 54 and 54 . The operation of support 10 is as follows.The hank or hanks not shown are carried on base 11 and remain depending therefrom, while the hank carrier usually moves along rail 40. At particular locations of the path, where a perfect attitude is desired, generally a perfect horizontality of the support base and or where the hank rotation is desired, the cam elements 50 are prearranged.Therefore, by its portion 32 said spindle 20 abuts or encounters the cam surface 52 not only the mutual cooperation would maintain the horizontal relationship for base 11, but also maintain the accurate attitude of gear wheel 29 relative to chain 60, and accordingly enables the accurate rotation of the cage base 12 on its axis without any j amaings and breakages or failures.Of course, said cam element 50 could be extended throughout the rail path. Or, at some sections said element 50 could only have said cam 52 and not said rotation chain 60, or still instead of chain 60 there could obviously be provided other control means e.g.toothed means for controlling the rotation of gear wheel 29.The support variant or modification shown in Figs. 5 to 7 is indicated by reference numeral 110. Therein, the elements corresponding to those of support 10 have been indicated by the same reference numerals, but increased by 100, and will not be described in detail. Said support 110 comprises a base 111 and an arm 112. The cage base 111 is formed of rods 114 connected by a cap 118 at the outer end and a washer or pan 116 at the inner end of the base. This washer or pan 116 is welded on a bush 170 which through labyrinth shiedls or baffles 172 and bearings 174 and 176 is rotatable on a stationary pin 178. In Fig. 7 reference numeral 173 indicates a tight sealing and 175 a position limiting disc. Pin 178 is carried for example, screwed down as shown in the drawing on an extension 180 of bar 136 of said arm 112, which extension is bent at the end to form a kind of follower 182 for engagement with the surface 152 of cam 152. A gear wheel 129 is welded to a sleeve 170. The cam element 150 differs from element 50 only as to the shape, but also has a cam 152 at the top as chamfered at the ends and in addition a surface 154 on a L shaped element 156 secured by screws 158 . The section of chain 160 is located on surface 154 for meshing with said gear wheel 129.The operation of this second embodiment is quite similar to the operation described for the first embodiment.If course, all of those changes and modifications that will become apparent to those skilled in art can be made to the foregoing description, without departing for this from the covering field of the present invention.
