# Process for the preparation of gel for use as cooling medium.

## Abstract
A process for the preparation of a gel for use as a cooling medium is provided which comprises the steps of casting an aqueous solution or suspension containing a polyvinyl alcohol having a degree of hydrolysis of not less than 95 mol and a viscosity average polymerization degree of not less than 1500 into a mold having desired shape and dimensions, cooling the cast aqueous solution to a tempera ture of not higher than minus 6 C, and then dehydrating without thawing the cooled mass of the cast aqueous solution in vacuum until the percentage dehydration rate reaches not less than 5 wt .
