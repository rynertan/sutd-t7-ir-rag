# TEMPERATURE CIRCUIT FOR OXYGEN SENSOR DURING WARM UP

## Abstract
A composite electronic circuit accurately controls air fuel ratio in an engine having an electronically regulated fuel supply, such as an electronically regulated fuel injection system. The air fuel ratio is measured by an oxygen sensor connected to the exhaust manifold. A circuit associated with the oxygen sensor compensates for variations in sensor output produced by temperature change during warm up. After engine warm up is completed, the circuit provides a voltage having a value independent of engine temperature.
