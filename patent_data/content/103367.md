# Silicone containing molded polyurethanes.

## Abstract
A process of reaction injection molding of polyure thanes is disclosed which includes the mixing of one or more of each of polyols, isocyanates, and catalysts, the reaction of the foregoing ingredients, and the molding and curing of the foregoing mixture into the desired configu ration, the improvement comprising mixing with the other ingredients a silicone selected from the group consisting of Z The incorporation of this composition aids in the re lease of the molded parts, shortens the molding cycle time, and, in the reaction injection molding process of polyure thanes, allows a two stream process.
