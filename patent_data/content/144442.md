# METHOD OF CONTROLLING INDUSTRIAL ROBOT ALONG ARC.

## Abstract
A method of controlling an industrial robot along an arc wherein the position of a working member attached to the wrist of the industrial robot is controlled along an arc by interpolation, while the angle of the working member with a respect to a surface being worked is controlled. The method comprises the steps of obtaining corresponding points P₁, P₂ ... Q₁, Q₂ ... of the far end and near end of the working member TC attached to the wrist HD of the robot at a plurality of instruction points, for controlling the far end of the working member TC along an arc obtaining interpola tion points of the far end and near end of the working member from interpolation using the pairs of corresponding points and obtaining command quantities for the operation al axes of the robot from both interpolation points.
