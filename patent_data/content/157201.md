# Tape end detecting device.

## Abstract
A device is described for use in a tape player for detecting the tape end made of transparent material. The oscillator 12 generates pulses b , which are de layed 14 and made to control a LED 15 . A light detector 18 should thus give a signal only when the tape end has been reached, and only during the delayed pulse. If, however, stray light on the detector makes signal g go high without the LED being activated, then the output c is blocked by AND gate 23 . Thus a stop signal is given only when emitted light pulse and detected light pulse are synchronised, and the effect of ambient light is eliminated.
