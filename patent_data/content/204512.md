# Porous cellulose ester articles having striated surfaces.

## Abstract
Skinless shaped articles having increased specific surface area and based on cellulose esters, including both solid and hollow fibers 1A , can be produced with at least one surface having a striated or fibrous appearance 1C and a cellular interior structure 1B by extruding a spinning solution comprising a cellulose ester and a solvent therefor directly into an aqueous bath, wherein the residual content of solvent in the bath is maintained at a concentration below a critical level, preferably less than about 10 weight percent.
