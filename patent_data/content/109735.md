# AUTOMATIC WIRING APPARATUS WITH ROTATABLE INSERTION TOOLING

## Abstract
Machine for interconnecting wire in slot type terminals 32 in connectors 30, 42 mounted on a panel board 20 utilizes a wire feel wheel 70 , rotatable insertion tooling 10, and an X Y table 16 . Wire 22 is fed vertically through a rotation housing 150 past wire inserters 170, 175 mounted above an aperture 53 in a rotary plate 52 . Wires 22 are positioned for termination by wire feeding and movement of the X Y table 16 on which the panel board 20 is mounted. Independently pivotable idler wheels 72 cooperate with the feed wheel 70 to engage one or two wires 22 . Insertion is effected by downward movement of the rotation housing 150 which drives the inserters 170, 175 through the aperture 53 in the rotary plate 52 . The rotation housing 150 is moved by pivoting a yoke 113 with a variable pivot point 114 to change limits of travel and therefore insertion depth. The plate 52 , inserters 170, 175 , and rotation housing 150 may be rotated to four orthogonal orientations to insert wires 22 in terminals 32 having four respective orientations. Through wire type inserters 170 may be shifted laterally on the rotary plate 52 by solenoids 219 so that wire cutt off type inserters 175 will be poised above the aperture 53 in the rotary plate 52 , making the apparatus capable of threading a wire 22 through several connectors 30 prior to cutting it.
