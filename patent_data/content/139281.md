# A thin film electroluminescent display device.

## Abstract
An improved dark field material for use in a thin film electroluminescent display device that typically includes a transparent electrode layer, a segmented electrode layer and an electroluminescent phosphor layer between the electrode layers. The improved dark field layer is of a composition of a dielectric material such as the preferred magnesium oxide and a noble metal, which is preferably gold co evaporated by way of an electron beam deposition technique. The preferred range of noble metal by volume is 6 101 . By varying the noble metal content within this range, there is provided control of the operating temperature of the electrolumines cent display device.
