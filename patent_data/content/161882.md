## Description
IMPROVEMENTS IN ADSORBENTS This invention relates to improvements in adsorbents and more specifically to an adsorbent the adsorbability of which increases when heated but decreases upon cooling. Activated carbon has been used extensively for the recovery of valuable materials or the removal of impurities or pollutants from solutions such as aqueous solutions and for other purposes. Adsorbents making use of an nonionic styrene divinylbenzene copolymer as their base materials have been developed in recent years. Many investigations are now under way with a view toward using them in a wide variety of fields.Since the base material, i.e., the styrenedivinylbenzene copolymer contains an aromatic ring having extremely strong hydrophobicity, the elution of materials adsorbed on the adsorbents is effected using an acidic or alkaline solution as an eluent or with various organic polar solvents. However, such elution methods develop various problems when eluting materials susceptible to alteration in quality or nature by heat, acids bases, organic solvents or the like. Such materials include physiologically active substances including antibiotics, vitamins, enzymes, proteins, steroids and the like. If the adsorption and elution are effected at different temperatures, it is necessary to perform the adsorption at a low temperature and the desorption at a higher temperature because the adsorbability decreases when heated.Furthermore, no substantial difference in adsorbability occurs even when the temperature is changed. It is accordingly indispensible to make the elution conditions for the above elution methods severe in order to carry out the adsorption and separation with good efficiency. Thus, contamination of eluates with eluents is unavoidable. When removing contaminants or impurities from a valuable material on the other hand, it is difficult selectively to remove such unnecessary materials only from the valuable material.A significant loss of the valuable material results because the base material contains aromatic rings of extremely high hydrophobicity and under the circumstances its hydrophobicity cannot be fully controlled, In the case of substances having water solubility but relat√¨velyvhigh hydrophobicity such as proteins or antibiotics, non specific ana irreversible adsorption may take place on the adsorbent. This remains as one problem causing contamination of the adsorbent. It has recently been disclosed to use a polymer of an N substituted acrylamide derivative as a base material for an ionvexchange resin in JapanesePatent Laid open Nos. 105,758 1981 and 96,615 1983 as well as Biopolymers , 22, 839 847 1983 . The ion exchange resin has been known to have such a property that it may be used even for aqueous solutions containing electrolytes at high concentrations and for various organic solvents. For many years, compounds have been known having temperature dependent hydrophobicity, in other words, cloud points when converted into organic polymers.Some attempts have already been made to utilize their temperature dependent hydrophobicity for adsorption and separation. For example, Japanese PatentLaid open No. 121,804 1980 contains one Example in which the adsorption of polyethyleneglycol nonylphenyl ether having a polymerization degree of 10 was conducted using an adsorbent composed of alumina and polyvinyl methyl ether carried thereon.It has recently been discovered that the aboveodescribed phenomenon may also take place with an aqueous solution of a polymer of Ncisopropylacrylamide, For example, it is disclosed on page 117 126 of the Abstracts of Research Papers Read at the 1983 Meeting of ResearchInstitute for Polymers and Textiles, Agency of Industrial Science and Technology, Japanese Government that making use of the above described property of the aqueous solution of the N isopropylacrylamide polymer, the adsorption of polyethyleneglycol nonylphenyl ether having a polymerization degree of 10 was carried out using an adsorbent composed of cotton fabric and N isopropylacrylamide graft polymerized thereon.In each of the above disclosures, properties of the base material, i.e., the N isopropylacrylamide polymer as an adsorbent do not appear to have been fully clarified, because the polyethyleneglycol nonylphenyl ether used as the solute contains by itself nonylphenyl groups, which are hydrophobic groups, and polyethyleneglycol groups which become hydrophobic upon heating. According to a study conducted by the present inventors, they do not seem to be satisfactory as adsorbents as demonstrated byComparative Examples which will be given herein. With a primary objective placed on the separation of proteins, water soluble high molecular compounds, and like substances, another development has been made on a separation method in which the hydrophobicity of hydrophobic groups such as phenyl groups or alkyl groups are utilized by introducing such hydrophobic groups into polysaccharides such as agarose. Although the above separation method does not develop non specific irreversible adsorption as mentioned above, upon elution of the previouslyadsorbed protein contamination of the eluate with an electrolyte, acid, base or the like is unavoidable.In addition, such a polysaccharide gel generally has low mechanical strength. When a solution is passed through the polysaccharide gel, in order to conduct the adosorption and removal of contaminants, impurities or the like from the solution, the polysaccharide gel tends to develop problems such as pressure loss, clogging and the like. Therefore, it is not a fully satisfactory adsorbent, An object of this invention is to provide an adsorbent capable of minimizing contamination by an eluent such as acid, base or electrolyte when eluting an adsorbed material, and which has an adsorption and desorption function such that the adsorption and desorption take place at higher temperatures and lower temperatures respectively, the adsorbent exhibiting good adsorbability and excellent mechanical strength. According to the present invention, there is provided an adsorbent prepared by water insolubilizing a a homopolymer of one of N,N disubstituted meth acrylamides as hereinafter defined , or b a copolymer of two or more of the N,N disubstituted meth acrylamides or c a copolymer of one or more of the N,N disubstituted meth acrylamides and one or more other copolymerizable monomers, which homopolymer or copolymer is rendered hydrophobic when heated. The adsorbent obtained by the present invention may be used for the adsorption and separation of various physiologically active substances and various organic compounds from solutions containing the same, inter alia for the decolorization and purification of solutions containing various compounds1 and for the adsorption treatment of various waste liquids. An adsorbent according to this invention exhibits adsorbability which increases when heated but decreases upon cooling. The invention is now explained in more detail in the following description of preferred embodiments, which description is given by way of example of the invention. The term N,N disubstituted meth acrylamides as used herein means N,N disubstituted acrylamides andN,N disubstituted methacrylamides, and the terms homopolymer and copolymer of these N,N disubstituted amethacrylamides t mean polymers including as the case may be at least one monomer which is represented either by the following general formula EMI7.1 wherein R1 means a hydrogen atom or methyl group, and A denotes CH2 z , n being 4 to 6, or CH2 t 1 CH2, or by the general formula II EMI7.2 wherein R1 means a hydrogen atom or methyl group andR2 denotes a methyl or ethyl group.The adsorbent is obtained by water insolubilizing i a homopolymer of one of these N,N disubstituted meth acrylamides, ii a copolymer of two or more of the N,N disubstituted meth acrylamides or iii a copolymer of one or more of the N,N disubstituted meth acrylamides and one or more other copolymerizable monomers, The adsorbent obtained by the present invention is rendered hydrophobic to increase its adsorbability when heated but it decreases its adsorbability upon cooling.

Illustrative of monomers copolymerizable with the above described monomers are hydrophilic monomers, ionic monomers and hydrophobic monomers.One or more of such monomers may be used. More specifically as hydrophilic monomers, meth acrylamide and their lower alkyl substituted, hydroxyl substituted and polyalkyleneglycol substituted derivatives may be mentioned. In addition, it may also be possible to use monomers imparted with hydrophilicity by hydrolysis of polymers. Representative examples of such hydrophilic monomers are acrylamide methacrylamide N methylacrylamide N ethylacrylamide N n propylacrylamide N n propylmethacrylamide N isopropylacrylamide N isopropylmethacrylamide diacetoneacrylamide hydroxyethyl methacrylate hydroxyethyl acrylate hydroxypropyl methacrylate hydroxypropyl acrylate various methoxypolyethyleneglycol methacrylates various methoxypolyethyleneglycol acrylates N vinylc2 pyrrolidone vinylphenol isopropenylphenol and the like Furthermore, hydrophilicity may also be imparted by introducing vinyl acetate, glycidyl methacrylate or the like through copolymerization and then subjecting the resultant copolymers to hydrolysis. As ionic monomers, may be mentioned carboxyl substituted monomers, sulfo substituted monomers, dialkylamino substituted monomers and so on, Additionally may be mentioned those monomers imparted with ionic properties by the hydrolysis of polymers.Typical ionic monomers are or example acids such as acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, vinylsulfonic acid, allylsulfonic acid, methallylsulfonic acid, styrenesulfonic acid, 2 acrylamido 2 phenylpropanesulfonic acid, and 2 acrylamido 2 methylpropanesulfonic acid, and their salts as well as amines such asN,N dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate, N,N diethylaminoethyl methacrylate N,N dimethylaminoethyl acrylate,N,N dimethylaminopropylmethacrylamide and N,N dimethylaminopropylacrylamide, and their salts. Ionic properties may also be imparted by introducing various acrylates, methacrylates, acrylamides, methacrylamides, acrylonitriles and the like through copolymerization and then subjecting the resultant copolymers to hydrolysis. Hydrophobic monomers can include alkyl substituted, glycidyl substituted and glycidoxyalkyl substituted derivatives of meth acrylamide, meth acrylate derivatives, nitrile substituted monomers, esterified monomers, and aromatic ring substituted monomers, etc.Representative examples are N alkyl meth acrylamide derivatives such as Ncethylmethacrylamide, N,N di n propylacrylamide, N n butylacrylamide,N n butylmethacrylamide, N tert butylacrylamide,N tert butylmethacrylamide, N n hexylacrylamide,N n hexylmethacrylamide, N n octylacrylamide,N n octylmethacrylamide, N tert octylacrylamide,N n dodecylacrylamide, N n dodecylmethacrylamide and the like N cs glycidoxyalkyl meth acrylamide derivatives such as N,N diglycidylacrylamide, N,Ndiglycidylmethacrylamide, N 5 glycidoxypentyl acryl amide, N 6 glycidoxyhexyl acrylamide, etc. meth acrylate derivatives such as ethyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate, butyl methacrylate, lauryl acrylate, 2 ethylhexyl methacrylate, glycidyl methacrylate and so one acrylonitrile vinyl acetate vinyl chloride styrene c methylstyrene butadiene isoprene and the like, For water insolubilizing the polymers of the above defined monomers, they may be insolubilized upon polymerization or by treating them subsequent to their polymerization, Specific insolubilization methods may involve 1 copolymerizing the above methacrylamide derivatives with a crosslinkable monomer containing two or more double bonds per molecule, wherein the term the meth acrylamide derivatives 4 here and hereafter in this description means the N,N disbustituted meth acrylamides as described in the formula I or II or a combination thereof with the above described copolymerizable monomers 2 copolymerizing the meth acrylamide derivatives with N alkoxymethyl meth acrylamide derivatives 3 copolymerizing the meth acrylamide derivatives with a hydrophobic monomer in large proportions relative to the meth acrylamide derivatives 4 polymerizing without a solvent the meth acrylamidederivatives 5 subjecting the polymers to heat treatments, 6 integrating the polymers with a waterinsoluble fibrous material such as cellulose or the like 7 when hydroxyl groups, amino groups or the like are contained in the polymers, to react such groups with a polyfunctional compound such as epichlorohydrin so as to crosslink and insolubilize the polymers, 8 as well as copolymerizing the polymers with a monomer containing a substituent group, which contains active hydrogen such as carboxyl group, sulfonic acid or sulfo group, hydroxyl group or the like, substituted thereto or to cause the polymers to form composite materials with a polymer containing such substituent groups substituted thereto, More specifically, the first method can employ, as the crosslinkable monomers, inter alia N,Nt methylenebisacrylamide, N,N diallylacrylamide, triacrylformal, N,N diacryloylimide, N,N dimethacryloylimide, ethyleneglycol acrylate, ethyleneglycol dimethacrylate, various polyethylene glycol diacrylate, various polyethyleneglycol dimethacrylates, propyleneglycol diacrylate, propyleneglycol dimethacrylate, various polypropyleneglycol diacrylates, various polypropyleneglycol dimethacrylates, 1,3 butyleneglycol diacrylate, 1,3 butyleneglycol dimethacrylate, 1,4 butyleneglycol dimethacrylate, glycerol dimethacrylate, neopentyglycol dimethacrylate, trimethylolpropane triacrylate, trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate, trimethylolethane trimethacrylate, trimethyloletbane triacrylate tetramethyloylmethane tetramethacrylate, tetramethylolmethane triacrylate, divinyl benzene and diallyl phthalate, The N alkoxymethyl meth acrylamide derivatives used in the second method can include an Nhydroxymethyl meth acrylamide derivative examples of said derivatives include N methylol meth acrylamide, N methoxy methyl meth acrylamide, N ethoxymethyl meth acrylamide, N n butoxymethylfmeth acrylamide and N tert butoxymethyl meth acrylamide. In the third method, the proportion of the hydrophobic monomer to the meth acrylamide derivative having amphiphilic properties may vary depending on the choice of meth acrylamide derivative and hydrophobic monomer and cannot thus be sweepingly determined to any specific proportion. However, its proportion may generally be at least 1 or preferably 3 or more.As a technique for effecting the bulk polymerization in the fourth method, it may be feasible to employ such a technique as polymerizing a monomer without diluting it with a solvent so as to obtain a polymer block or effecting polymerization in droplets of the monomer while suspending the monomer in a solvent so that the resultant polymer is obtained in a granular or particulate formv In the fifth method in which each polymer is subjected to a heat treatment, the heating conditions vary depending on the polymer. However, a polymer obtained by bulk polymerization, suspension polymerization, solution polymerization or the like may generally be subjected to a heat treatment at 60 250 C or preferably 80 200 C.In the case of a polymer obtained by solution polymerization, the heat treatment may be conducted concurrently with the drying of the polymer or the removal of solvent from the polymer, In the sixth method, in which the polymer is integrated with a fibrous material or other substrate, it may be possible to impregnate a water insoluble fibrous material such as fibers of cellulose, nylon, polyester or acrylic polymer, non woven fabric made of polypropylene, ethylene propylene copolymer or the like or a water insoluble porous inorganic material such as silica, alumina or zeolite with the abovedescribed meth acrylamide derivative, followed by polymerization of the meth acrylamide derivative there, graft polymerizing the meth acrylamide derivative to such fibers, non woven fabric or porous inorganic materials, or impregnating such fibers or non woven fabric or porous inorganic materials with a homopolymer or copolymer of the meth acrylamide derivative. In the seventh method, in which a polyfunctional compound such as epichlorohydrin is reacted to cross link and insolubilize the homopolymer or copolymer, it is necessary to introduce hydroxyl or amino groups in the homopolymer or copolymer in advance.Amino groups can be readily introduced by copolymerization, In the case of hydroxyl groups, they may be introduced by copoly merizing the meth acrylamide derivative with hydroxyethyl methacrylate, isopropenylphenol or the like or by copolymerizing the meth acrylamide derivative with vinyl acetate, glycidyl methacrylate or the like and then saponifying the resultant copolymer with a basic substance. Thereafter, the resultant polymer is reacted with thepolyfunctional compound such as epichlorohydrin in the presence of a basic substance to crosslink and insolubilize the polymer. Upon conducting the reaction, the polymer is turned like agar agar when it is insolubilized as is, namely, in the aqueous form. By crushing the thus insolubilized product, it becomes ready for actual applications.On the other hand, the polymer can be obtained in the form of a granular or particulate gel when its aqueous solution is dispersed in an oil and is then insolubilized. In the eighth method of insolubilization, where, the formation of the composite material is effected by copolymerizing the meth acrylamide derivative with the above described monomer containing active hydrogen, mixing the polymer of the derivative with a polymer of the monomer, or substituting active hydrogen atoms in a polymer of such a monomer with ammonium ions or the like, and then adding an acid to the resultant mixture to restore active hydrogen for the formation of the composite material. The eight above described methods may be employed either singly or in combination. Better results may generally be obtained when two or more of the above methods are used in combination. As more specific polymerization methods useful for preparation of the adsorbent of this invention in accordande with the above described methods, it is possible to employ such a method as 1 polymerizing the monomer as is without diluting same with any solvent so as to prepare a polymer block, 2 polymerizing the monomer in a solvent, and drying the resultant polymer after its polymerization or causing the polymer to deposit in a poor solvent so as to obtain the polymer, 3 obtaining as a granular or particulate polymer by suspension polymerization, 4 obtaining as a polymer latex by emulsion polymerization, or 5 impregnating or graft polymerizing a solution of the polymer to an water insoluble fibrous material or porous inorganic material so as to integrate the polymer with the fibrous or inorganic material. As a method for initiating the polymerization, better results may generally be obtained from the use of a polymerization initiator although the polymerization may still be initiated by simply heating the monomer, No limitation is imposed on the polymerization initiator so long as it can initiate radical polymerization, Illustrative of the polymerization initiator may be inorganic peroxides, organic peroxides, combinations of such peroxides and reducing agents, and azo compounds. Specific per compounds include potassium persulfate, hydrogen peroxide, tert butyl peroxide, benzoyl peroxide, tert butyl peroxy 2 ethyl hexanoate and butylperbenzoate. Reducing agents which may be combined with such polymerization initiators include sulfites, hydrogensulfites, low valence metal salts such as iron, copper and cobalt salts, organic amines such as aniline, and reducing sugars such as aldose and ketose. It may be feasible to use, as azo compounds, azobisisobutyronitrile, 2,2l azobis 2 amidinopropane hydrochloride, 2,2 azobis 2, 4 dimethylvaleronitrile, 4,4v azobis 4 cyanovaleic acid and so on.Two or more of the above described polymerization initiators may be used in combination, It is sufficient if such a polymerization initiator is added within an amount range usually employed, for example within the range of 0,01 to 5 wt, or preferably 0.05 to 2 wt. based on the weight of the monomer or monomers, Of polymers obtained in the above manner, those obtained in block forms or available after removal of solvents by distillation may be crushed into powder or molten and formed into granules or beads, flakes, fibers or films, Particulate or granular polymers may be utilised as they are. Latex like polymers may be impregnated or coated onto fibrous materials such as fabric or paper or may be formed into films.They can then be utilised as adsorbents. Adsorbents may be prepared in various forms by the methods described above. Their most suitable forms are determined depending on how they will be used. The separation and purification of valuable materials or substances, and the removal of impurities from valuable materials or substances, may be mentioned as one of principal utilities of the adsorbents of this invention Such separation, purification and removal are generally carried out by column chromatography. Adsorbents packed in such columns are conveniently of powdery or granular forms, including from those employed for analytical liquid chromatography to those used for chromatography as industrial separation means.Powdery products may be obtained by various methods, for example, by conducting gel polymerization in an aqueous solution and then drying and crushing the resultant gel as described above. On the other hand, granular products may generally be produced with ease by suspension polymerization. Since N,N disubstituted acrylamides or methacrylamides which are used in the present invention are generally highly soluble in water, suspension polymerization may be effected using the reversed phase suspension polymerization technique in which a monomer, its aqueous solution or the like is dispersed in an oil. The salting out suspension polymerization technique can be used instead the polymerization is conducted under such conditions that a large amount of an electrolyte or the like is dissolved in an aqueous solution to suppress the solubility of a monomer.Further, the deposition and suspension polymerization technique can be used, in which polymerization is effected at a high temperature above the cloud point of the resulting polymer so as to deposit the resulting polymer. It is also possible to use adsorbents obtained by integrating such polymers with inorganic porous particles, granules or beads such as silica, alumina or zeolite, for example by impregnating or graft polymerizing solutions of the polymers onto the surfaces of such inorganic porous particles, granules or beads, Porous polymers may also be prepared if a third component miscible with the monomers but immiscible with the resulting polymers is added upon polymerization of the monomers.

Compounds containing hydrophobic groups include those containing, as their hydrophobic groups, cyclic structures such as aromatic rings and long chain hydrocarbon radicals More specific classes of such compounds are e.g. surfactants, proteins, physiologically active substances such as antibiotics, amino acids, aromatic compounds, colorants and perfumes, They are generally hydrophobic by themselves but still have solubility in water, Surfactants here include all anionic, non ionic, cationic and amphoteric surfactants.Examples of anionic surfactants are fatty acid soaps,N acylamino acids and their salts, salts of alkylethercarboxylic acids, acylated peptides, salts of alkylbenzenesulfonic acids, salts of alkylnaphthalenesulfonic acids, salts of dialkylsulfosuccinic acid esters, salts of i olefinsulfonic acids, N acylmethyltaurine, sulfonated oils, higher alcohol sulfates, alkyl ether sulfates, polyoxyethylenealkyl phenyl ether sulfates, and phosphoric acid esters.Illustrative examples of non ionic surfactants are alkyl and alkylaryl polyoxyethylene ether, alkylarylformaldehyde condensed polyoxyethylene ether, block polymers containing polyoxypropylene groups as hydrophobic groups, polyoxyethylene ethers of glycerin esters, polyoxyethylene ethers of sorbitan esters, polyoxyethylene ethers of sorbitol esters, polyethylene glycol fatty acid esters, glycerin esters, sorbitan esters, propylene glycol esters, sucrose esters, fatty acid alkanol amides, polyoxyethylene fatty acid amides, polyoxyethylene alkylamines, and alkylamine oxides, Cationic surfactants, may be exemplified by aliphatic amine salts, their quaternary ammonium salts, and heterocyclic quaternary ammonium salts, Amphoteric surfactants may for example include carboxybetaine type surfactants, aminocarboxylic acid type surfactants and imidazolinium betaine. As to proteins, those soluble in water are preferred. A very wide range of proteins may be employed. Since proteins are polypeptides having molecular weights in the range of from 1,000 to 1,000,000, their types are extremely diversified and cannot all be exemplified. Representative examples only are given below sucrose, glucagon, cytochrome C, myoglobin, chymotrypsinogen, egg white albumin, ovomucoid, malic acid dehydrogenase, bovine serum albumin, transferrin, E. coli phosphatase, lactoperoxidase, fetuin, glyceraldehyde 3 phosphoric acid dehydrogenase, lactic acid dehydrogenase, serum albumin, aldolase, yeast alcohol dehydrogenase, ceruloplasmin, fumarase, catalase, t globulin, R phycoerythrin, b conarakin, fibrinogen, apoferritin, urease, p galactosidease, ferritin and O crytallin.

Each of them includes a number of compounds of different types.Even taking antibiotics by way of example, they may be classified into penicillin type antibiotics, cephalosporin C type antibiotics, macroride type antibiotics, chloramphenicol type antibiotics, tetracycline type antibiotics, etc. As to amino acids, those described above may be applied. Amino acids substituted by hydrophobic groups such as aromatic rings can provide high molecular composite materials having stronger intermolecular forces. As aromatic compounds, may be cited cyclic hydrocarbon compounds such as benzene, naphthalene, anthracene, and phenanthrene or compounds containing fused rings obtained by condensing heterocyclic rings on hydrocarbon rings such as indole, carbazole, benzofuran, anthraquinone, and benzothiophene.Also included are those compounds obtained by substituting one or more alkyl groups, halogen atoms, nitro groups, amino groups or the like to the above aromatic or heterocyclic rings, those obtained by substituting one or more hydroxyl groups, carboxyl groups, sulfonic acid groups, or the like to the above aromatic or heterocyclic rings but further ionizing by replacing the active hydrogen of their substituent groups with metal ions such as alkali metal ions, and those formed by converting their hydroxyl groups into oxygen such as benzoquinone. Colorants, can include those obtained by introducing chromogenic groups into the above described aromatic compounds. They may be roughly classified into dyes, organic pigments, coloring agents, various titration indicators and so on. Exemplary dyes include cationic dyes, basic dyes, acid dyes, disperse dyes, substantive dyes, sulfur dyes, vat dyes, azoic dyes, fluorescent brightening dyes, and composite dyes.Organic pigments may include soluble azo pigments, insoluble azo pigments naphthol type , insoluble azo pigments anilide type , phthalocyanin type pigments, color lakes, mordant type pigments alizarin type , and vat pigments,Coloring agents may include synthetic tar colors and their aluminum lakes as well as natural colors, all of which are principally employed as food colors, for example red food colors, yellow food colors, green food colors, blue food colors, p carotene, iron chlorophylllin sodium, and copper chlorophyll.Amongst titration indicators may be mentioned neutralization indicators such as Methyl Red and phenolphthalein, chelate titration indicators such as ureo chromium black and cresolphthalein complexon, redox titration indicators such as Methylene Blue and diphenylamine 4 sulfonic acid, and adsorption indicators such as fluorescein and dichlorofluorescein. Perfumes contain aromatic rings or long chain alkyl groups as their skeletal structures, to each of which may be substituted one or more of acyl, alkoxy, formyl, alkyl, alkenyl, alkoxyacyl, amino, hydroxyl, lactam, hydroxyalkyl, hydroxyalkenyl, formylalkyl, formylalkenyl, carboxyalkyl, carboxyalkenyl, alkoxycarbonylalkyl, alkoxycarbonylalkenyl and alkoxycarbonyl groups. Among specific methods for adsorbing and separating the above described compounds by using the abovedescribed adsorbent of this invention, it is possible to employ a the batch method in which the adsorbent is added to aqueous solutions of the above compounds to adsorb the compounds on the adsorbent, b the fixed bed method in which the adsorbent is packed in columns or the like and the aqueous solutions are caused to flow therethrough, and c the fluidized bed method in which the adsorbent is caused to flow through the aqueous solutions, Since the mechanical strength of the adsorbent is high, it is possible to cause the aqueous solutions to flow at high flow velocities in each of the above methods. When adsorbing the above compounds on the adsorbent, it is better to conduct the adsorption at relatively high temperatures. It is however essential to control the adsorption temperatures at levels at which the adsorbate compounds do not undergo quality alteration or lower. The adsorbability does not always increase as the temperature rises. In some instances, there are optimum temperatures. Therefore, the adsorption temperature cannot be defined sweepingly. It may generally be within the range of 10 1000C. It is however convenient to effect actual adsorption after the optimum temperature has been ascertained by effecting an adsorption test in advance.Turning next to the pH of each aqueous solution upon conducting its adsorption, the adsorbent of this invention can be used in both acid and alkaline ranges so long as the adsorption is effected under usual conditions because the adsorbent of this invention contains an N,N disubstituted meth acrylamide polymer as its base material. In the case of compounds substituted by substituent groups having an active hydrogen such as one or more carboxyl groups, sulfonic acid groups, hydroxyl groups, phosphoric groups and or the like, the adsorbability may generally be increased if their adsorption is effected in a neutral to acidic range.In the case of amphoteric substances such as amino acids, the adsorbability may be increased if their adsorption is effected at pH levels below their isoelectric points. The amount of each adsorbate adsorbed in the above manner may vary depending for instance on the polymer type, the structure of the adsorbent such as the existence or non existence of macropores, the type of the adsorbate compound, and the adsorption method, etc.However, it is approximately 1 1,000 mg g adsorbent.The adsorbability may be increased by forming macropores in the adsorbent. If an adsorbate compound cannot be dissolved in water or the like, it is possible to use a solvent such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, acetone, dioxane, dichloroethane, benzene, toluene, hexane or the like alone or mixed with water. Turning next to the desorption temperature, the adsorbate can be desorbed more efficiently and the adsorbent can thus be recovered with better efficiency as the temperature falls, The desorption temperature is within the range of 10 500C. Alternatively, it is possible to effect desorption in an alkaline state in the case of the above described compounds substituted by substituent groups containing active hydrogen or at pHs of isoelectric points or higher in the case of amphoteric substances or in combination of above described methods. After desorption, a new adsorbate solution may be caused to pass through columns to undergo adsorption again, Otherwise, after desorption, the adsorbent regeneration can be carried out by passing chilled water or an alkaline solution through columns to wash thoroughly the adsorbent. The most suitable polymer composition varies depending on the compound to be adsorbed and separated.It is thus preferred to carry out an adsorption test in advance for each adsorbate compound so that a suitable polymer composition can be selected,However, it is practically impossible to conduct such a test on every combination. As general tendency, relatively good results may in many instances be obtained if an adsorbent having relatively low hydrophobicity is used upon adsorbing and separating highly hydrophobic compounds and if an adsorbent having relatively high hydrophobicity is employed upon adsorbing and separating compounds having low hydrophobicity. As a method for judging the hydrophobicity of the adsorbent of this invention, it is possible to utilize the property of the adsorbent that it is rendered hydrophobic when heated. Namely, when polymer components of this invention are formed into aqueous solution without their insolubilization, many of them are rendered hydrophobic and exhibit cloud points when heats. Based on the cloud points, it is possible to judge the hydrophobicity of the polymers. Generally speaking, the hydrophobicity becomes more marked as the cloud point decreases and the hydrophilicity increases as the cloud point becomes higher. Examples of measurement of cloud points of polymer components of this invention in their aqueous solutions will be given herein as Referential Examples. A polymer having a low cloud point has high hydrophobicity. Therefore, it can adsorb more adsorbate. There is thus a problem on the desorbability of the adsorbate at low temperatures.Where the cloud point of a polymer is high on the other hand, its hydrophobicity is low and it can generally adsorb less adsorbate. However, the desorbability of the adsorbate is better. As mentioned above, the adsorbability varies depending on the composition of each polymer.Although not applicable to all adsorbents, the maximum value of the adsorbability is about 100 mg per gram of dry adsorbent when adsorption is effected at a high temperature. The adsorbability may be controlled, for example, by changing the surface structure of each adsorbent into a porous structure. When effecting desorption at a low temperature, it is ideal if the adsorbate can be desorbed in its entirety. However, the desorption cannot be completely achieved in some instances as the desorption is somewhat related to the adsorbability. The composition of each polymer may thus be chosen depending on whether the importance is placed on adsorption or on desorption. Although it has not been elucidated to date why the N,N disubstituted meth acrylamide polymers in the adsorbents of this invention show better adsorbability than N mono substituted meth acrylamide polymers, they show the following differences when converted into aqueous solutions. When N,N diethylacrylamide andN n butylacrylamide having the same molecular formula are compared with each other, the former is formed into a water soluble polymer having a cloud point of 350C while the latter is turned to a water insoluble polymer. The cloud point of the former compound is substantially comparable with the cloud point, i.e., 330C of an N isopropylacrylamide polymer as an N monosubstituted meth acrylamide. Even among N,N disubstituted meth acrylamides, the cloud point increases further to 510C in the case of N acryloylpyrrolidine, in which the substituent groups form a ring via an amido group. As mentioned above, the difference in properties shown in aqueous solutions between the N mono substituted compound and the N,Ndisubstituted compound appears to give some influence on their adsorption properties of the polymers although they have exactly the same constituent elements. Among properties of polymers. other than described above, ionic property Which may be either cat ionic or anionic may be introduced into such polymers by copolymerizing N,N disubstituted meth acrylamides with the above described ionic monomers so that two types of mechanisms, i.e., both ionic and hydrophobic interactions can be used in combination. Accordingly, more selective adsorption and easier desorption are feasible, thereby making it possible to conduct separation in a state less contaminated by an acid, base, electrolyte or the like.It is also possible to use two types of mechanisms, i.e., both affinity interaction and hydrophobic interaction for adsorption and separation by copolymerizing an N w glycidoxyalkyl acrylamide such as N,N diglycidylacrylamide or N 4 glycidoxybutyl acrylamide with an N,N disubstituted meth acrylamide to introduce highly reactive epoxy groups into the resultant polymer and then reacting an amino acid, a protein such as an antigen, antibody, or an enzyme a colorant or the like to the polymer. Therefore, more selective adsorption and easier desorption are feasible. In this case, separation is feasible also in a state less contaminated by an acid, base, electrolyte or the like. The adsorbent of this invention has the following advantageous effects 1 Since it can adsorb upon heating and desorb upon cooling as has been described above, adsorption and desorption can be effected while maintaining the pH and composition such as electrolyte in each solution as they are. It is hence possible to minimize contamina tion by an acid, base, electrolyte and or the like and at the same time to separate a valuable material or substance in a purer state. 2 Since it makes use of a polymer of an N,Ndisubstituted meth acrylamide as a base material, it is an adsorbent having excellent mechanical strength so that it may be used over a wide pH range, at a high electrolyte concentration, and even in organic solvents, to say nothing of water. 3 Separation may be effected with better efficiency in accordance with two or more different mechanisms by introducing ionic groups or a protein or the like which can induce an affinity interaction, Adsorbents according to this invention have an extremely wide range of specific utility, including for example 1 adsorption and separation of vitamins, antibodies, enzymes, steroid antibiotics and other physiologically active substances from fermentation liquors, 2 decolorization of a variety of aqueous saccharide solutions, 3 separation of aliphatic and aromatic carboxylic acids, sulfonic acid and phosphoric acid esters, 4 decolorization of various saccharified starch liquors, 5 as packing materials for gas chromatography and liquid chromatography, 6 removal of phenols, 7 separation of various surface activating materials, 8 adsorption and separation of various perfumes, 9 decolorization of pulp mill waster water, and 10 decolorization and purificatiofl of various chemical substances such as drugs and agricultural chemicals. The present invention will hereinafter be described in further detail by the following Examples,Example 1 After adiabatically polymerizing a 30 aqueous solution of N acryloylpyrrolidine which contained 0.5 wit. of N,N methylenebisacrylamide, the resultant gel was chopped into small pieces and then dried.Thereafter, the thus dried gel was crushed and a 20 100 mesh fraction was collected as a sample, To 50 ml of an aqueous solution containing 310 ppm of phenol, 1.0 g of the sample powder was added. After stirring the mixture for 15 minutes at a predetermined temperature, it was allowed to stand for 5 minutes. By measuring the absorbance of its supernatant at 254 nm, the amount of adsorbed phenol was calculated. The adsorbed amount per gram of the sample powder was measured at various temperatures, resulting in 1.30 mg at 0.50C, 2.00 mg at 250C, 2.25 mg at 400C, 3.50 mg at 60 C and 4.10 mg at 80 C.

The thus obtained gel was chopped into small pieces and dried at 1200C. Then, it was crushed and a 20 100 mesh fraction was collected as a sample.Using the sample powder, the amount of adsorbed phenol per gram of the sample powder was measured at various temperatures in the same manner as in Example 1. It was 1.70 mg at 0.50C, 2.15 mg at 25 C, 5.5 mg at 400C, 6.5 mg at 600C and 7.0 mg at 800C. When the temperature was lowered again to 0.50C thereafter, it was 1.65 mg.Example 22 A sample powder was obtained in exactly the same manner as in Example 1, using a 30 aqueous solution ofN acryloylmorpholine which contained 2.0 wt. of N,N methylenebisacrylamide. Using the sample powder, the amount of adsorbed phenol per gram of the sample powder was measured at various temperatures in the same manner as in Example 1. It was 1.25 mg at 0.50C, 3.5 mg at 250C, 5.7 mg at 400C, 7.70 mg at 600C and 8.50 mg at 800C. When the temperature was lowered again to 0.50C thereafter, it was 1.20 mg.Referential Example 1 To a 100 ml, four necked, round bottom flask, were added with stirring and under a nitrogen gas stream 45.0 g of distilled water and 5.0 g ofN acryloylpyrrolidine, followed by further addition of 0.50 g of ammonium persulfate and 0.23 g of sodium hydrogensulfite. The contents were polymerized at 15 300C for 4 hours. The resultant aqueous polymer solution was placed in a testing tube having an inner diameter of 15 mm, in which a standard thermometer was inserted. The temperature of the solution was gradually raised while stirring it with the thermometer in a temperaturecontrolled bath. The solution started clouding at 48.50C, and at 510C was clouded so much that the mercury bulb of the thermometer was no longer visible.Even when heated further beyond the above temperature, the aqueous solution remained in the stable cloudy state. When the solution was progressively cooled, it became clear at temperatures below the cloud point.Referential Examples 2 41 Polymerization was conducted in exactly the same manner as in Referential Example 1 except that the monomer combinations given in Tables 7, 8, 9 and 10 were used. However, the amounts of ammonium persulfate and sodium hydrogensulfite were each reduced to one half in Referential Examples 2, 3, 5, 16 and 20 41.Using the thus obtained aqueous polymer solutions, their initiation temperatures of clouding and cloud points were measured in exactly the same manner as inReferential Example 1. The term cloud points means the temperatures at which the mercury bulb of the thermometer became no longer visible due to clouding.Results are shown in Tables 7, 8, 9 and 10. By the way, the term n initiation temperatures of clouding means the temperatures at which their respective solutions started clouding when heated. In each of the Referential Examples, the clouded solution became colorless and clear by its cooling. Table 7 EMI54.1 Ref.
