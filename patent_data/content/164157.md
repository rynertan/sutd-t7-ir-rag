# Polymer blend composition.

## Abstract
A thermoplastic moulding composition having good low temperature properties, low distortion at paint bake tempera tures, and overall shrinkage similar to shrinkage of thermo plastic olefins comprises blends of a selectively hydrogenated monoalkenylarene conjugated diene block copolymer, a vinyl aromatic α,β unsaturated cyclic anhydride copolymer, a poly carbonate, and a saturated diblock copolymer.
