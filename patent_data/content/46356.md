# ULTRASOUND IMAGING SYSTEM

## Abstract
A standard articulated B scan arm provides positional and directional information for a transducer at its end, based on relative angular displacements of the separate arm seg ments. A real time scanner, preferably one having a fixed trans ducer and a fixed oscillating mirror, is freely attachable or deta chable from the scan arm. The probe itself is operable either in a real time sector scan or in a static B scan mode.
