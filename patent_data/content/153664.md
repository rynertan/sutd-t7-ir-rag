# Playback apparatus for audiovisual disc records.

## Abstract
In a playback apparatus a first sync code is detected from a series of data blocks to separate binary digits of multi channel still picture data from binary digits of multi channel audio and computer control data. Second and third sync codes are subsequently detected from the separated binary digits of the audio and computer control data. A data selector 66 is responsive to a channel selection manual command signal and to the second sync code for selecting the audio data words of a desired channel and the computer control data bits of a desired channel from the separated binary digits of the multi channel audio and computer control data. A video converter 70 is responsive to the command signal for storing the still picture data words of a desired channel for a predetermined period and converting the stored data words into an analog video signal for application to a visual display 63 . An audio converter 78 converts the selected audio data words into an analog audio signal for application to a loudspeaker 80 . A decoder 77 is provided to respond to the detected third sync code by decoding the computer control binary digits of the selected channel into ccmputer control data words for application to a personal computer 74 which is coupled to the display 63 .
