# System for controlling the starting operation of an internal combustion engine.

## Abstract
A control system employing a microcomputer, which controls the starting operation of a spark ignition type en gine provided with a fuel injection system. The control sys tem is loaded with, at least, contact information of an igni tion switch 90 for connecting an ignition device 58 to a power supply 88 and a starter switch 92 for connecting a starter motor 76 to the power supply 88 , and an out put signal of a temperature sensor 56 for detecting the temperature of cooling water 84 of the engine. In case where the cooling water temperature is not higher than a predetermined temperature, a fuel pump 32 which plies pressurized fuel to an injector 12 of the fuel injec tion system is started simultaneously with the closure of the ignition switch 90 , and this fuel pump 32 is stopped dur ing the operation of the starter motor 76 .
