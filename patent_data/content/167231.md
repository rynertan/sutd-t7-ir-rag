## Description
PHOTORESPONSIVE DEVICE INCORPORATING IMPROVED BACK REFLECTOR Back reflectors in photoresponsive semiconductor devices are commonly formed of highly reflective elements and alloys to provide a suitable light redirecting layer and back contact. These reflectors are deposited on an active semiconductor body forming a photoresponsive device if the semiconductor body is disposed on a light transmissive substrate. Examples of such reflecting contacts are described in U.S.Patent 4,416,052 to Stern for a gallium arsenide device and in Japanese patent applications 56 137179 to Fukatsu and 56 197859 to Ootake for amorphous silicon devices. Different problems are presented, however, in devices in which the incident light does not pass through the substrate. In those devlces, the reflective back contact must be interposed between the substrate and the semiconductor. Typically the back reflector is deposited on a substrate and then a semiconductor body is deposited on the reflector. Therefore, in these structures the reflective contact must adhere not only to the semiconductor body, but also to the substrate. In addition, the reflector should prevent or minimize cross diffusion of atoms from the semiconductor and the substrate.However, known reflective materials that have been employed as back reflectors do not solve the adhesion and cross diffusion problems. To alleviate these problems, back reflectors formed on substrates from such highly reflective materials as aluminum, copper and sliver, have been sandwiched between layers of chromium, titanium and titanium oxide, and titanium and tin oxide. However, the use of these adhesion promoting and diffusion inhibiting layers also referred to as 2 buffer layers has not been effective. The buffer layers must be very thin to prevent excessive light absorption, decreasing diffusion resistance. Frequently, a high reflective material cracks or peels from the deposition surface of the substrate. Or, the body of semiconductor material cracks or peels from the deposition surface of a highly reflective back reflector. This cracking and peeling is believed to be due to the cross diffusion of elements at the back reflector substrate interface and at the back reflector semlconductor material interface, respectively, causing strain. Even when adhesion promoting and diffusion limiting buffer layers are employed to isolate the back reflector from the substrate and the body of semiconductor material, the silver, aluminum or copper material from which those buffer layers are typically fabricated, agglomerate, preventing the adhesion of the subsequently deposited back reflector. Previous attempts to employ aluminum as a back reflector for an amorphous silicon alloy semiconductor photoresponsive device not receiving light through its substrate have been unsuccessful because of the cross diffusion resulting in formation of an aluminumsilicon compound. Prior attempts at utilizing copper as a back reflector for fluorinated amorphous silicon deposited on a substrate have proven unsatisfactory because of the incompatibility of copper with subsequently deposited fluorinated amorphous silicon alloys. Fluorine reacts with the copper to form a copper fluorine compound.As with the aluminum silicon compound, the copper fluorine compound deleteriously affects the properties of the back reflector and the photoresponsive properties of the semiconductor material. Attempts to use silver as a back reflector have also been unsuccessful despite the fact that silver back reflective material presents no diffusion problems. Silver and various of its alloys, if deposited in economically thin layers approximately 50 nanometers thick , tend to agglomerate interfering with the subsequent deposition of uniform layers of semiconductor material. Titanium, tin oxide, and chromium layers were originally proposed and designed for use with silver back reflectors to promote and improve adhesion, but are not capable of effectively preventing the problem of non uniform surface coverage. The problems previously encountered are solved in the invention by depositing a highly reflective material having a grain size much smaller than that of previously employed back reflectors. The inventive reflector includes a highly reflective material alloyed with a passivating agent. By appropriately selecting and alloying the highly reflective material, preferably aluminum or silver, with small percentages of the passivating agent, preferably silicon, reducing the grain size, a thin layer of highly reflective material, completely covering the substrate may be deposited. In one preferred embodiment of the invention1 cross diffusion of elements at the substrate back reflector interface and at the back reflector semlconductor material interface is substantially reduced by enriching highly reflective aluminum with a relatively small percentage of silicon. Such enrichment has been found to reduce the amount of cross diffusion substantially and to promote adhesion of the back reflector to the substrate and of the semiconductor material to the back reflector, while simultaneously maintaining the high integrated reflectivity of the alloyed aluminum material. In its preferred forms, approximately 1 15 percent, and preferably about 5 7 percent, of silicon is alloyed with the highly reflective aluminum.The deposition can be effected by sputtering from commercially available aluminum silicon 5 percent silicon targets. Other conventional deposition processes such as evaporation, electron beam deposition and d.c. sputtering may be utilized without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. For an amorphous silicon alloy photovoltaic device, the optimized range of optical response for an overhead sun shining through the atmosphere, an AM1 condition, is approximately 350 700 nanometers.Therefore, the integrated reflectance must be measured over the entire 350700 nanometer range rather than at a single wavelength. The silicon enriched alloy described has an integrated reflectance of approximately 88 percent over the cited range of wavelengths and therefore is suited for photovoltaic applications. Figure 1 is a fragmentary, cross sectional view of a tandem photovoltaic device, said device comprising a plurality of p i n type cells, each layer of the cells formed from a semiconductor alloy. Figure 2 is a cross sectional view illustrating a single cell of the photovoltaic device of Figure 1 incorporating a back reflector or according to the invention that has been deposited on an electrically conductive substrate. Figure 3 is a cross sectional view of a single cell of the photovoltaic device of Figure 1 incorporating a back reflector according to the invention that has been deposited on an electrically insulating substrate having a thin conducting coating. Figure 1 shows a p i n type photovoltaic device 10, such as a solar cell, comprising individual p i n type cells 12a, 12b and 12c. A substrate 11 functions as a first bottom electrode, and may be transparent or formed from a metallic material such as stainless steel, mild steel, aluminum, tantalum, molybdenum or chromium, but is not intended to transmit light. Although certain applications may require a thin oxide layer andlor a series of base contacts be disposed on substrate 11 prior to deposition of the semiconductor material, for purposes of this application, the term substrate includes not only a flexible film, but also any elements added by preliminary processing. Each of cells 12a, 12b and 12c is fabricated with an amorphous semiconductor body containing a silicon or germanium alloy. Each of the semiconductor bodies includes a n type conductivity semiconductor layer 20a, 20b and 20c an intrinsic semiconductor layer 18a, 18b and 18c and a p type conductivity semiconductor layer 16a, 16b and 16c. As illustrated, cell 12b is an intermediate cell and, as indicated inFigure 1, additional intermediate cells may be added. A TCO transparent conductive oxide layer 22, formed in the preferred embodiment of indium tin oxide, is deposited on the semiconductor material to form a second electrode and to transmit light to the cells 12. An electrode grid 24 may be applied to layer 22 to shorten the carrier path through the TCO and thus increase current collection efficiency. While cell 10 illustrated in Figure 1 is a stacked assembly of p i n cells, the invention may be employed with other cell arrangements such as single p i n cells, stacked or single n i p cells, p n cells,Schottky barrier cells, and the like. Accordingly, in the description and claims that follow, the layer or layers of semiconductor material disposed between substrate 11 and electrode 22 are referred to as the body of semiconductor material , meaning semiconductor layers for the flow of electrical current including the switching currents of photodiodes and photoresistors and photogenerated currents. In Figures 2 3, photovoltaic cells 30 and 40, respectively, each include a body of semiconductor material 26 such as the p i n layers of semiconductor material 16, 18 and 20, previously depicted and described with respect to Figure 1 . A transparent conductive oxide layer 22, such as indium tin oxide, is deposited on body 26 for transmission of light to the underlying cells. A highly reflective back reflector 28 is disposed between body 26 of semiconductor material and electrode 11. In photovoltaic cell 30, back reflector 26 is deposited directly on an electrically conducting substrate 11 that is preferably formed of nickel, aluminum or stainless steel.In photovoltaic cell 40, back reflector 28 is deposited directly on a thin layer of electrode material 13, such as nickel, silver, indium tin oxide, etc., that is, in turn, deposited on an electrically insulating substrate 15, such as a polyimide. Use of electrically insulating substrate 15 allows electrical interconnection of small area segments of a large array of photovoltaic cells in series, parallel or combination series parallel arrangements. In the preferred embodiment, the highly reflective aluminum silicon alloy back reflector can be deposited on a substrate by conventional magnetron sputtering. When employed with an elongated web of substrate material, magnetron sputtering permits deposition of the reflective material in a roll toroll assembly line process in which the body of semiconductor material is also deposited in the continuous, roll to roll process. It is therefore possible to automate production of an amorphous photoresponsive devices entirely. In the magnetron sputtering example, argon gas is pumped into a deposition chamber. A fixed substrate may be disposed in the chamber or a web of substrate material may continuously pass through the chamber.An aluminum alloy containing five percent silicon sputtering target is disposed in close proximity to the substrate. The impact of argon ions on the target causes erection of the aluminum silicon species from the target that are deposited on the substrate. A uniform aluminum five percent silicon alloy layer of highly reflective material is deposited upon the entire surface area of substrate. In operation, the pressure within the chamber is about 0.3 pascal while the flow rate of the argon gas is maintained at about 40 standard cubic centimeters per minute. Approximately 2.5 kilowatts of power, 540 volts at 6.1 amperes, are employed to elect the aluminum silicon particles from the target and deliver them to the substrate. A web substrate passes through the deposition chamber at a speed of approximately 40.6 cm. per minute to deposit a thickness of approximately 100 nanometers of aluminum silicon back reflector material. The highly reflective alumlnum five percent silicon alloy thus deposited substantially eliminates interdiffusion of elements between the semiconductor material back reflector and the back reflector substrate interfaces and promotes adhesion between the materials fording those interfaces.
