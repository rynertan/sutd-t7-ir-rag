# Four electrode submerged arc welding process.

## Abstract
A four electrode submerged arc welding process em ploys connections of four electrodes aligned in one row for alternating current source so that electromagnetic force Fxâ‚„ in a direction opposite to a welding direction acting upon a middle point of the arc from the rearmost electrode is within 25 Fx 10 N m . The connections are preferably selected such that phase differences among currents applied to the three electrodes other than the frontmost or rearmost electrode are 120 , respectively, and a phase difference of the remaining frontmost or rearmost electrode is within 0 30 relative to the furthermost electrode. With such connections of the four electrodes, the four electrode submerged arc welding process remarkably prevents welding defects such as undercuts even at higher welding speeds.
