## Abstract
A data card, such as a cash card, bears a magnetic strip on which data may be magnetically stored and an optical panel comprising a series of parallel black stripes. Appa ratus for use with the card has an optical infra red reader 2 , a magnetic read write device 3 and signal processing circuitry 6 . Reader 2 permits the velocity of travel of the card relative to the apparatus on insertion by the user to be sensed, which in turn enables magnetically encoded in formation to be read from the magnetic strip and processed without corruption. The apparatus and card can therefore function without the necessity for a complex and expensive card transport.
