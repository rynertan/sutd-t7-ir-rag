# Purifying ethyl tetrahydrofurfuryl ether by aqueous salt extraction.

## Abstract
Mixtures including ethyl tetrahydrofurfuryl ether ETFE , tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol THFA , ethanol and water, and usually also an ethyl halide, are extracted with an aqueous solution of an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal chloride salt until THFA ETFE ratios below 0.01 or 0.001 are achieved. Thereby THFA and ethanol, each of which are difficult to separate from ETFE by distillation, are removed.
