## Description
The invention pertains to a current source control potential generator for compensated current switch emitter follower CCSEF logic circuits. Furthermore, the invention pertains to such a current source control potential generator for an arrangement in which a reference voltage is supplied from off chip to a plurality of CCSEF circuits. Current source circuitry for ECL devices was described in an article Current Sources for Emitter Coupled Logic Circuits and Their Application to Subnanosecond Logic Integrated Circuits by K.Tanaguchi et al., Transactions of the IECE of Japan, Vol. E60, No.12, Abstracts, December 1977, pp.754 755. A circuit arangement shown in Fig.1 of this publication serves for reducing the voltage drop across the constant current source of an ECL circuit. The circuitry realizes a low supply voltage of 3 V in a high level ECL the voltage drop across the current source is 1 V or less An example of compensated current switch emitter follower logic circuitry which has been known for some time is described by Muller et al. in Fully Compensated Emitter Coupled Logic Eliminating the Drawbacks of Conventional ECL , IEEE Journal of Solid State Circuits, Vol. SC 8, No. 5, October 1973, pp. 362 367 the circuitry illustrated in Fig.4 of that article is shown in modified form in Fig.1 herein. In this circuit, input transistors 13 and 14 are coupled in parallel with one another. The bases of the transistors 13 and 14 are connected to input terminals IN 1 and IN 2 to which two input logic signals are applied. The commonly connected collectors of the transistors 13 and 14 are coupled through a resistor 22 to a terminal to which a positive power supply voltage V In the modified form of the circuitry shown in Fig.1 herein, two output transistors 11 and 23 are provided, both of these being connected in an emitter follower configuration with their emitters coupled through resistors 12 and 24, respectively, to a fixed potential V In operation, when at least one of the input signals applied to the terminals IN 1 and IN 2 is in the UP positive state, the corresponding transistor 13 or 14 is turned on, thereby causing most of the current which flows through the constant current source transistor 16 to flow through the respective transistor 13 or 14 and the resistor 22. The transistor 18 is then off and the transistor 23 on, thereby causing the output signal on the terminal OUT 1 to be at the UP level. The voltage at the base of transistor 11 is lower than the voltage at the base of transistor 23, and therefore terminal OUT 2 is at the DOWN level. In this manner, the logical OR of the signals on the input terminals IN 1 and IN 2 is produced on the terminal OUT 1 and the logical NOR of those signals on the terminal OUT 2. The transistor 18 is turned off in the case that an UP level is applied to the base of one of the transistors 13 and 14, in which case the collector of the transistor 18 is pulled in the negative direction by the Schottky barrier diode 19. Similarly, when the transistor 18 is on and both the transistors 13 and 14 are off in the case that DOWN level signals are applied to both input terminals IN 1 and IN 2, the commonly connected collectors of the transistors 13 and 14 are pulled in the negative direction by the Schottky barrier diode 20. This limits the voltage swings in the circuit, thereby reducing the switching delay times through the circuit. Ordinarily, there are, of course, many circuits such as the one shown in Fig. 1 on a single integrated circuit chip. In one prior art approach, it was the practice to provide on each chip a reference voltage generator for supplying the voltage V Various circuits have been proposed for generating a current source control potential such as V Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a current source control potential generator for a plurality of logic circuits, which enables small logic level signal swings to be employed without adversely affecting the noise margin of the various circuits. The current source control potential generator should include compensation for variations in both positive and negative supply voltages as well as for temperature. These objects are met by a generator of a current source control potential for a plurality of compensated current switch emitter follower logic circuits, as defined in claim 1. The invention allows to maintain a narrow symmetrical logical signal range or UP DOWN signal swing, despite varying supply voltage and temperature, for a plurality of logic circuits by a single common control potential generator. In the sequel, the principle and embodiments of the invention will be described with reference to following drawings Fig. 1 is a circuit diagram of a prior art CCSEF logic circuit Fig. 2 is a block diagram of a current source control potential generator of the invention Figs. 3 4 are, respectively, circuit diagrams of two embodiments of a current source control potential generator of the invention. Referring to Fig. 2, there is shown a block diagram of a current source control potential generator constructed in accordance with the teachings of the invention. The circuit includes three sections a simulated CCSEF circuit 31, a differential amplifier 32 and a level shifter buffer circuit 33. V With reference now to Fig. 3, a first embodiment of a current source control potential generator of the invention will now be described. The simulated CCSEF circuit 31 is constructed by simulating that portion of the CCSEF circuit of Fig. 1 which is in the active state at any one time, that is, by simulating that portion of the circuit needed to produce an output UP logic level. This is done by arranging circuit components, including transistors 41 and 47, resistors 42, 43 and 46, and a Schottky barrier diode 44, in a configuration which is equivalent to the circuit of the current source transistor 16, resistor 17, one of the transistors 13 and 14, the Schottky barrier diode 19, the resistors 21 and 22, the emitter follower transistor 23 and the output resistor 24 in Fig. 1. In Fig. 3, the reference numerals of the components of Fig. 1 which are simulated by corresponding elements are shown in parentheses. It may be noted that there is no actual component in Fig. 3 corresponding to one of the transistors 13 and 14, only a wired connection. This is due to the fact that there is very little base current in a bipolar transistor when it is in its active region, and the collector is nearly equal to the emitter current. Hence, the effect of such a base current can in many cases be assumed to be negligible. However, if desired, a transistor can be inserted in series with the transistor 41 in Fig. 3 with an UP level applied to its base so as to simulate the presence of the transistor 13 or 14. The simulated CCSEF circuit 31 differs from the configuration of Fig. 1 in that the resistor 24 of Fig. 1 has been replaced by three resistors 48, 49 and 50 connected in series between the emitter of the transistor 47 and the V The voltage V Because many logic circuits will ordinarily employ the potential V It should also be noted that in the simulated CCSEF circuit of Fig. 3 that there is no resistor in series with the Schottky barrier diode 44. This is due to the fact that, when the current source control potential generator of the invention is employed, minimal differences between UP and DOWN logic levels can be used, that is, the resistor 15 Fig. 1 may be a short circuit in CCSEF circuits which use V The voltage at the emitter of the transistor 47 will be the same as the UP level for the CCSEF circuit of Fig. 1 since both are using as a current source reference potential the same V If, for instance, V In the circuit of Fig. 3, the resistors 52 and 58 are provided for purposes of frequency compensation and to prevent oscillation or ringing from occurring. However, they may be omitted if these factors are not important. Other circuit configurations are possible to achieve the objects of the invention. In a circuit configuration shown in Fig. 4, the Schottky barrier diode 51 is omitted and the resistances of the resistors 65 and 66 are chosen so that V
