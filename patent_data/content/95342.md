# DIRECT CONTACT WATER HEATER

## Abstract
This invention relates to an improvement in direct contact water heaters and in methods of effecting heat exchange between hot gas and cold water. In a typical direct contact water heater cold water is sprayed downwards within a main chamber 20 where it meets hot gas passing upwardly in a counter current fashion. A direct contact water heater according to this invention includes an ante chamber 30 through which the hot gas is passed before entering the main chamber 20 . The hot gas passing upwardly in a counter current fashion to hot water which is at a tempera ture higher than the dew points of the gas raises the dew point of the hot gas before it enters the main chamber 20 so that the cold water entering the main chamber 20 is heated in an efficient manner to higher temperatures that could otherwise be achieved.
