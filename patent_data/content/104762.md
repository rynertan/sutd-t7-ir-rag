# Apparatus for optically measuring the distance between two grating like structures and the size of periodic pattern elements forming one of the grating like structures.

## Abstract
The distance between first and second grating like structures such as a shadow mask 11 and a faceplate 12 of a color picture tube or the size of pattern elements of the second grating like structure such as black stripes 13 formed on the inner surface of the faceplate 12 is optically measured. The shadow mask 11 has a periodic pattern of apertures or slots and the faceplate 12 has a periodic pattern of the black stripes 13 . An optical system 15 to 19 located between a light source 14 and an assembly of the first and second grating like structures 11, 12 applies parallel rays of light to the assembly and is arranged to vary an incident angle of the parallel rays to the assembly. A photodetector 24 detects the quantity of light passed through the assembly to produce an electric signal whose amplitude periodically varies with variation in the incident angle of the parallel rays to the assembly. A signal proces sing unit 30 evaluates the distance between the first and second grating like structures 11, 12 or the size of pattern elements 13 forming the second grating like structure 12 on the basis of the electric signal from the photodetector 24 .
