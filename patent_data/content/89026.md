# A linear concentrating solar collector.

## Abstract
The present application relates to a segment of a linear concentrating solar collector which comprises two plates 1 distanced from each other extending parallel to each other means 2 connecting said plates to each other, holes 9 bored at each of said plates in a parallel manner along a parabolic curve and means 3 passing through said holes each holding a small strip made of a reflecting material all strips together forming a parabolic surface. The application relates also to a collector comprising at least two of each segments and an absorber extending along the focus line of the entire collector. Said collector is advantageously pro vided with horizontal and or vertical means which ascertains that the collector can follow the position of the sun.
