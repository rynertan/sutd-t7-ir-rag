# FUEL INJECTION PUMP WITH SPILL CONTROL MECHANISM

## Abstract
A rotary fuel injection pump with a rotor 16 having pumping plungers reciprocable in a plunger bore 42 reciprocated for supplying high pressure charges of fuel for fuel injection an a spill control mechanism having one or two rotary spill valves 37 mounted on the rotor 16 and rotated in unison with the rotor 16 and in synchronism with the reciprocable movement of the pumping plungers for spill control of the high pressure charges of fuel.
