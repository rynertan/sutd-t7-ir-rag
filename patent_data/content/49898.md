# Method for immunochemical assay and kit therefor.

## Abstract
In a method for immunochemical assay of human chorionic gonadotropin involving use of an antibody immo bilized on a carrier, an antigen and an antibody to which a labeling agent has been attached, when an antibody sup ported on the carrier and the antibody coupled to a labeling agent, and they are different antibodies which are not overlapping in antigen determining site and one of said different antibodies is specifically reactive to human chor ionic gonadotropin, is used, a high reproducibility of the result of the immunochemicai assay is obtained.
