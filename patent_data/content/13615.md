# Apparatus for controlling a.c. motor.

## Abstract
A first PWM inverter 1 for converting the ac voltage of an ac power source AC to a dc voltage is connected through a dc circuit with a second PWM inverter 2 for driving an ac motor 3 . A smoothing capacitor 15 is provided in the dc circuit. The firing angles of the first inverter 1 are so controlled thaty the voltage in the dc circuit may be kept at a predetermined value and the second inverter 2 is controlled in accordance with the speed instruction signal for the ac motor 3 , whereby the ac motor 3 can operate a regenerative operation without inducing higher harmonic components.
