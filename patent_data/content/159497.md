## Description
This invention relates to a novel collagenase discolysin having an activity capable of dissolving insoluble collagens and a production method thereof. As a collagenase having an activity of dissolving insoluble collagens, the enzyme produced by Namely, this invention provides a novel collagenase which is useful for biochemical researches and the treatment of many diseases caused by collagen, such as hernia of intervertebral disc, and can be produced by a microorganism. The above enzyme has been found to dissolve both non denatured and denatured collagens. This enzyme will hereinafter be called discolysin . In one aspect of this invention, there is thus provided a novel collagenase discolysin having the following physical and chemical properties said collagenase being obtainable by culturing strain Streptomyces C 51 FERM BP 710 . In another aspect of this invention, there is also provided a method for producing a novel collagenase discolysin , which comprises culturing said discolysin producing bacterium belonging to genus of Streptomyces in a culture medium and then collecting discolysin from the culture medium. The above and other objects, features and advantages of this invention will become apparent from the following description and appended claims, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which Microorganisms useful in the practice of this invention are discolysin producing bacteria in the genus of Streptomyces. As an exemplary strain which has been recognized to be particularly effective for the present invention, may be mentioned Streptomyces sp. C 51 strain This strain has been deposited under FRI deposition FERM BP 710 with the Fermentation Research Institute, Agency of Industrial Science and Technology, Ministry of International Trade and Industry. The above strain was isolated by the present inventor from soil which had been obtained at Ohira, Numazu. Its mycological characteristics are as follows No fragmentation of its vegetative mycelia is observed. Its hyphae and spore chains have wavy to spiral structures and contain 20 or more spores therein. Namely, it has properties between the Retinaculum Apertum RA type and the Spira type. A scanning electron microscopic observation has found that its spores are pillow like and 0.6 0.8 x 1.0 1.2 mµ large and its spore surfaces are smooth. Organs such as asci, sclerotia or zoospores are not observed. Its cell wall contains LL diaminopimelic acid LL DAP and glycine. No characteristic features are found on the saccharide which makes up the bacterium body. The state of its growth on various agar culture media were as shown in Table 1. Its growth temperature ranged from 10 to 40 C with the optimum growth temperature being near 28 C. The starch decomposing capacity, peptonizing capacity and coagulating capacity of skim milk, and liquefying capacity of gelatin on a glucose peptone gelatin culture medium were all positive. On the other hand, the producing capacity of a melanine like pigment, nitric acid reducing capacity, hydrogen sulfide producing capacity and cellulose decomposing capacity were not observed. It metabolized D glucose, L arabinose, D mannit and D fructose very well. It metabolized D xylose and inositol rather well. However, it did not metabolize or metabolized extremely little L rhamnose, raffinose, sucrose and cellulose. Summarizing the above properties, it can be concluded that the above strain is in the genus of Streptomyces, is of the RA or RAS type of the Gray series, has smooth spore surfaces, and is of the melanine negative non chromogenic type. Needless to say, bacteria in the genus of Streptomyces which bacteria are other than the above mentioned bacterium may also be used including their varieties and variant strains, so long as they show discolysin producing capacity. Discolysin can be produced in a culture medium by culturing a discolysin producing strain aerobically in accordance with any culturing method which is known as a culturing method for Actinomycetes. Discolysin producing bacteria grow at 10 40 C. A temperature range of 25 35 C is generally preferred for the production of discolysin. For culturing a discolysin producing bacterium in the genus of Streptomyces, it is possible to use any nutrient source known for culturing Actinomycetes and other microorganisms. For example, glucose, starch, dextrin, glycerin, sucrose and the like may be used as carbon sources. Of these carbon sources, glucose and sucrose are carbon sources both suitable for the production of discolysin. Nitrogen sources known for the growth of Actinomycetes and other microorganisms can all be used for the production of discolysin. For example, peptone, meat extract, yeast, yeast extract, soybean powder, peanut powder, corn steep liquor, rice bran, gelatin, various fish meal, inorganic nitrogen, etc. may be used. When discolysin is produced by culturing a discolysin producing bacterium, one or more inorganic salts and metal salts may be added if necessary. One or more heavy metals may also be added in trace amounts. Discolysin can be obtained by culturing a discolysin producing bacterium aerobically. For this purpose, a routinely employed aerobic culturing method, for example, the solid culturing method, shake culturing method or aerated stirring culturing method may be employed. If defoaming is required during culturing or in the course of sterilization of a culture medium, a defoaming agent such as silicone oil, surfactant or the like may be used. The preferred culturing temperature may be within the range of 25 35 C. The activity of discolysin can be measured by the following method in which discolysin dissolves collagen. Namely, 5 ml of a 0.067 M phosphate buffer pH 7.4 containing 0.45 of NaCl , 1 ml of a discolysin solution and 25 mg of collagen obtained from calf Achilles tendons are reacted at 37 C for 18 hours For a control, no enzyme is added . After the reaction, the liquid reaction mixture is filtered and 2.0 ml of the ninhydrin reagent is added to 0.2 ml of the filtrate. The resultant mixture is heated for 20 minutes in boiling water. Thereafter, the mixture is cooled in running water. The volume of the resultant mixture is adjusted to 10 ml with water. Fifteen minutes later, its absorbance is measured at a wavelength of 600 nm. From a standard curve obtained using L leucine as a reference, the amount of amino acids freed during the reaction is determined. From the thus determined amount, the physiological activities of discolysin can be determined. The culturing is continued until discolysin accumulates substantially. The extraction and separation of this substance from the cultured mixture may be carried out by suitably combining various methods on the ground of its properties found out by the present inventor, as will be shown in Examples which will be given hereinafter. Namely, there are the salting out method making use of ammonium sulfate or the like, the precipitation relying upon an organic solvent such as acetone or methanol, the chromatography employing various ion exchangers, the gel filtration making use of various carriers, a variety of electrophoreses, the ultrafiltration, the lyophilization method, the dialysis method, the chromatofocusing, and so on. Discolysin can be isolated from the cultured mixture by combining these methods or using them repeatedly. Physical and chemical properties and biological activities of discolysin will next be given. Discolysin can be used widely in a variety of biochemical, physiological and pharmacological researches which require decomposition of collagens. In addition, it can also be used extensively for the prevention and treatment of various diseases caused by collagens, for examples, hernia of intervertebral disc, Peyronie disease spongiositis , certain liver diseases, etc. For example, a dog under narcosis was subjected to abdominal incision. While confirming an intervertebral disc by palpation, a discolysin solution 0.05 ml was administered by injection through back peritoneum to nucleus pulposus located in a central part of the intervertebral disc. One week after the administration, the dog was killed and the intervertebral disc was observed. As a result, the nucleus pulposus was found to have been significantly dissolved where 100 units ABC units or more of discolysin was administered per each intervertebral disc. By the way, no serious toxicity or side effect was observed. As mentioned above, it has been confirmed that discolysin is effective for diseases caused by certain disorder in collagens and can hence be used as medical drugs, non medical drugs or food additives. Discolysin may be administered either orally or non orally, for examples, in the form of capsules, tablets, injectable preparations or the like. Its dose may vary depending on age, symptom, body weight, etc. However, 1 100 mg day may usually be administered in 1 3 portions to an adult. It may however be administered in a larger dose or more often as needed. Examples of this invention will hereinafter be described. Since various properties of discolysin have been found as mentioned above by the present invention, it is however possible to make various modifications to the collection of discolysin from a cultured mixture or its related substances on the basis of these findings. The present invention is thus not necessarily limited to the following Examples but should include all methods readily inferable from findings and knowledge which have already been reported. Fifteen liters of a culture medium containing 1 of sucrose, 1 of peptone, 0.3 of gelatin, 0.2 of yeast extract, 0.2 of Na₂HPO₄, 0.25 of Na₂CO₃ and 0.04 of MgSO₄ 7H₂O were charged in a jar having an internal volume of 30 liters. After sterilization, Streptomyces C 51 strain was inoculated and cultured aerobically at 30 C for 30 hours. After completion of the culturing, a filtrate 12 liters was obtained. Ammonium sulfate was then added to the filtrate. Fractions which precipitated at 45 80 saturation were collected. They were dissolved and dialyzed against 10 mM tris HCl buffer pH 7.5 4 mM CaCl₂, followed by adsorption on a DEAE cellulose column 3.2 x 26 cm . The column was then developed with a gradient system which consisted of 1 liter of the above buffer and 1 liter of a solution obtained by adding 1 mole of NaCl to the same buffer, thereby collecting discolysin fractions. These fractions were then dialyzed against 10 mM citric acid Na buffer pH 7.0 4 mM CaCl₂, followed by adsorption on a DEAE cellulose column 2.0 x 26 cm maintained under the same buffer conditions. Thereafter, the column was developed with a gradient system which consisted of 1 liter of the above buffer and 1 liter of 10 mM citric acid Na buffer pH 4.0 4 mM CaCl₂, thereby collecting principal active fractions. These fractions were then dialyzed against 0.2 mM CaCl₂ and lyophilized to obtain 51 mg as proteins of purified discolysin.
