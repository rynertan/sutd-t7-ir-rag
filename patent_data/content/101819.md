# Tapered threaded electrode joint and method for joining two electrode sections.

## Abstract
Taper thread joints in carbon or graphite electrode columns are protected from thread damage during assembly by use of a consumable centering pin 18 to assure axial alignment of the mating parts, thereby preventing thread damage and resulting thread debris from forming and interfering with the proper fit of the mating parts forming the joint.
