## Abstract
A connector for joining two components 32, 34 is dis closed. The connector comprises a self tapping or wood screw 16 which passes freely through the bore of an exter nally threaded component part 10 . The screw 16 is screwed directly into the member 34 or into a screw groove 42 thereof. The face of the part 10 which engages the member 34 is formed so that it bites into the member 34 so as to inhibit rotation of the component part 10 . A second compo nent 20 is internally threaded, the threading of the compo nent 20 being compatible with the threading of the compo nent part 10 . The component 20 is received in a bore 36 of the member 32 and tightened down until the head thereof engages the member 32 and clamps it to the member 34 . In another embodiment the screw 16 and component part 10 are replaced by a single unitary component. The single com ponent is stepped externally so as to provide two sections of different diameters. Both sections are externally threaded and the threading of the larger section is compatible with the threading.

## Description
THIS INVENTION relates to connectors for connecting two members to one another.BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION It is known to connect the various members of demountable furniture together using, for example nuts and bolts, and screws. Screws, if removed and re inserted a number of times, do not maintain their tightness. Nuts and bolts tend to be unsightly and do not find favour with furniture designers. The object of the present invention is to provide a connector which can be released and re connected without any loss of efficiency and which is aesthetically acceptable.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION According to the present invention there is provided a connector for joining two members to one another, the connector comprising first and second components, the first component having a cylindrical portion with threaded blind bore therein, said blind bore opening through one end of said portion, a formation for facilitating rotation of the component about the axis of said bore, and a head which is of greater diameter than said portion of the first component and which is at the end of said portion opposite to said one end, and the second component having a first externally threaded section which is co axial with a second externally threaded section, the diameter of the first section being greater than the diameter of the second section and the threading of the first section being compatible with the threading of said blind bore, said second component including a formation which facilitates rotation thereof about the common axis of said sections. Said formation of the first component can be a recess for receiving a screw driver or an Allen key, or can comprise flats for enabling the first component to be turned using a scanner or the like. In one form, said second component is of composite form and consists of two parts, one part including an externally threaded sleeve and the other part being constituted by a screw, the screw having a threaded shank which passes freely through the bore of the sleeve and protrudes from one end thereof and a head which is too large to pass through said bore, said sleeve constituting said first section and the portion of the shank of the screw which protrudes from said bore constituting said second section. In this form said formation of the second component is preferably constituted by the screw slot in the head of said screw and the end of the sleeve from which said screw shank projects is formed with a protuberance for penetrating that one of said members into which said screw is inserted. In another form said component is constituted by a piece of metal which is machined to form said two externally threaded sections of different diameters and to form a slot ir, the end of said first section which slot is adapted to receive a screw driver.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS For a better understanding of the present invention, and to show how the same may be carried into effect, reference will now be made, by way of example, to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is an axial section through one part of a first component of a connector according to the present invention Figure 2 is an end view of the part of Figure 1 Figure 3 illustrates a screw forming the second part of the first component Figure 4 is an axial section through a second component of the connector Figure 5 is an end view of the component of Figure 4 Figure 6 illustrates an assembled connector Figure 7 is an elevation of one component of a second connector Figure 8 illustrates the manner in which the components of Figures 3 and 7 are used in conjunction with one another to connect two members together and Figure 9 illustrates a further use of the components ofFigures 3 and 7.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The component part illustrated in Figures 1 and 2 is designated 10 and comprises a generally cylindrical sleeve having an axial bore 12 and external threading 14. The diameter of tne bore 12 is such that the threaded shank of the screw 16 illustrated in Figure 3 can pass freely through the bore 12. At the upper end as illustrated in Figure 1 the ore 12 is countersunk and at the lower end of the component part 10 there are diametrically opposed protruding ribs 18.The component part 10 can be of synthetic plastics material but is desirably of metal, and can be produced by die casting. The head of the screw 16 is too large to pass through the bore 12. The screw 16 of Figure 3, which constitutes the second part of a composite component of the connector, can be of any suitable type such as a wood screw, a self tapping screw or a machine screw. The diameter of its shank is such that it can pass freely through the bore 12, the head of the screw being such that it seats in the countersink provided therefor at the upper end of the bore 12. The component 20 illustrated in Figure 4 consists of a generally cylindrical portion 22 with a head 24 at one end of the portion 22. An internally threaded blind bore 26 is provided in the cylindrical portion 22, the bore 26 opening through that end of the cylindrical portion 22 which is remote from the head 24. The head 24 is round in end elevation as shown in Figure 5 and has at the centre thereof a recess 28. In the illustrated form the recess 28 is in the form of a socket which can receive an Allen key. The recess 28 could, however, be in the form of a screwdriver slot or cross. The threading 30 of the component 20 is compatible with the threading 14 of the component 10 and the head 24 is of larger diameter than the cylindrical portion 22. In the illustrated form both the top face of the head 24 and the annular underface thereof are flat. However, the top face may be domed. The recess 28 can be omitted in which event the head is hexagonal or some other shape such as square which provides flats to enable a spanner or similar device to be used in conjunction therewith. Figure 6 diagrammatically illustrates the manner in which the component part 10, component 20 and the screw 16 are used to connect two members 32 and 34 to one another.The member 32 is drilled so as to provide a through bore 36 the diameter of which is substantially the same as that of the cylindrical portion 22 of the component 20. In the illustrated form the bore 36 has been countersunk at 38 in such manner as to result in the upper face of the component 20 being flush with the outer face of the member 32.Countersinking is not, however, essential and if desired the top face of the member 32 can lie at the level shown by the chain dotted line 40 so that the head 24 stands proud of the face of the member 32. The component part 10 is secured to the member 34 by passing the screw 16 through the bore 12 into the member 34.The member 34 can be pre drilled if the screw 16 is not of the self tapping type. The screw 16 is tightened until it presses the component part 10 against the member 34. The ribs 18 penetrate in the member 34 so that the component part 10 is restrained from rotating. The part 10 and screw 16 now form a composite component of the connector. The member 32 is then positioned so that the component part 10 lies in the bore 36. As will clearly be seen from Figure 6, the component part 10 is a very loose fit in the bore 3E. The component 20 is inserted into the bore 36 and turned so that its threading 30 picks up the threading 14 of the component part 10. Using a spanner, screwdriver or Allen key depending on the nature of the head 24 the component 20 is tightened until the underface of the head 24 thereof engages the member 32. The head 24 presses the member 32 against the member 34 to provide a secure joint. The connector described can also be used for the purpose of securing a member such as the member 32 to an aluminium extrusion which has a screw groove.Conventionally, a screw groove in an aluminium section is part circular in cross section and extends through, say, 0 270 . In Figure 6 the position that would be occupied by such a screw receiving groove is shown at 42. In this form it is necessary for the screw 16 to be of the self tapping type. The ribs 18 can if desired by replaced by spikes or serrations which will penetrate the face of the member 34 and prevent rotation of tne component 10. Alternatively, the ribs or serrations car be omitted and a locking washer not shown can be proviced between the member 34 and the component 10. Figure 7 illustrates a component which, in conjunction with the component of Figure 4, forms a further embodiment of the present invention. The component of Figure 7 is designated 44 and consists of two threaded sections 46 and 48. The section 46 is of greater diameter than the section 48 and there is an annular shoulder 50 between the sections. The component is formed with a socket, screw groove or screw cross designated 52 and it will be noted that the component is devoid of any head which is of greater diameter than the section 46. The threading of the section 46 is compatible with the threading 30 of the component 20 and the threading of the section 48 is either a wood screw thread or a self tapping thread. Figure 8 illustrates the mode of use of the components 20 and 44. The section 48 of the component 44 is screwed into a member 54, the member 54 being shown as a piece of timber. It will be understood that it could, however, be an aluminium section with a screw groove therein.The component 44 is screwed in until the shoulder 50 engages the top face of the member 54. The member which is to be attached to the member 54 is designated 56 and this has a bore 58 therein the diameter of which is compatible with that of the outside diameter of the cylindrical portion 22. The member 56 is positioned so that the section 46 of the component 44 lies in the bore 58. The component 20 is then inserted into the bore 58 nd rotated so that its threading 30 picks up the compatible hreading of the section 46. Turning of the component 20 auses it to move into the bore 58 until the underface of the iead 24 engages the free face of the member 56. It will be understood that the component 20 can be attached to, and released from, the component 44 any numberIf times to form a readily demountable connecting system. The connectors described can also be used for the iurpose of mounting glass or other material which is insuffi gently strong or not capable of receiving a tapped screw. In Figure 9 reference numeral 60 designates a glass heet, reference numeral 62 an extrusion having a screw roove 64 and reference numeral 66 a strip which can be of petal or synthetic plastics material. The sheet 60 and the trip 66 have bores 68 and 70 therein of the same size, these ores being compatible with the portion 22. The component 44 is secured to the extrusion 62 by crewing the self tapping thread of the section 48 into the crew groove 64. The relatively fragile glass or plastics sheet 60 is then placed so that its bore 68 receives the section 46 and the strip 66 is placed so that its bore 70 registers with the bore 6B. Finally, the component 20 is inserted into the registering bores 68, 70, and tightened down so as to grip the sheet 60 between the strip 66 and the extrusion 62. The strip 66 can be countersunk if required to accommodate the head 24.
