## Description
The present invention relates to a method for passing a thread through a heddle formed with an eye, comprising steps of In accordance with known practice, a warp threading apparatus as shown in Figs. 1 A and 1 B has been employed to pass a warp thread WT through a heddle eye 2 in a heddle 1. This apparatus comprises an inlet guide cylindrical member 3 and an outlet guide cylindrical member 4. The inlet guide member 3 is formed with an inlet guide passageway 5 for guiding therethrough a hook member 6 with a hooked end 7 by which the warp thread WT is pulled. Likewise, the outlet guide member 4 is formed with an outlet guide passageway 8 for guiding the hook member 6 therethrough. The hook member 6 has a vertical thin flat portion 6a as shown. The inlet guide member 3 is arranged to be movable in the axial direction thereof and comprises upper and lower parts 3a and 3b Fig. 2 A which are movable toward and away from each other in the direction substantially perpendicular to the axial direction. Likewise, the outlet guide member 4 is arranged to be movable in the axial direction thereof and comprises upper and lower parts 4a and 4b which are movable toward and away from each other in the direction substantially perpendicular to the axial direction. The warp thread WT is passed through the inlet and outlet guide members 3 and 4 from the left hand side end of the inlet guide member 3 in Fig. 1 A to the right hand side end of the outlet guide member 4 in Fig. 1 A . First and second warp chucks designated by numerals 9 and 10, respectively, are adapted to grip the warp thread WT and positioned in the vicinity of the left hand side end of the inlet guide member 3. The first warp chuck 9 grips loosely the warp thread WT in such a manner that the warp thread WT is readily withdrawn therefrom when pulled by the hook member 6, while the second warp chuck 10 grips closely the warp thread WT in such a manner that the warp thread WT is held in position when pulled by the hook member 6. In such warp threading apparatus, the inlet and outlet guide members 3 and 4 are first axially spaced apart from each other, as seen from Figs. 2 A and 2 B , to allow the heddle 1 to be positioned therebetween. The upper and lower parts of each of the inlet and outlet guide members 3 and 4 are further vertically spaced apart from each other as seen from Fig. 2 A . The heddle 1 is taken out one by one from a heddle magazine not shown and caused to move as indicated by arrow in Fig. 2 B between the inlet and outlet guide members 3 and 4 by means of a take up heddle chuck not shown . In this instance, the heddle 1 is positioned such that the center axis of the heddle eye 2 thereof is in axial alignment with the longitudinal center axis of the inlet guide passageway 5 of the inlet guide member 3 and with the longitudinal center axis of the outlet guide passageway 8 of the outlet guide member 4. The upper and lower parts 3a and 3b of the inlet guide member 3 are then moved toward each other in the directions indicated by arrows in Fig. 2 A to connect together to form a single unitary member. At the same time, the upper and lower parts 4a and 4b of the outlet guide member 4 are moved toward each other in the directions indicated by arrows in Fig. 2 A to connect together to form a single unitary member. The single inlet and outlet guide members 3 and 4 are further moved axially toward each other to interpose the heddle 1 therebetween as seen from Figs. 3 A and 3 B and further from Fig. 7. On the other hand, the warp thread WT to be passed through the heddle eye 2 is supplied to the first and second warp chucks 9 and 10 by suitable means not shown . As shown in Fig. 4, the hook member 6 is then inserted into the outlet guide passageway 8 of the outlet guide member 4. The hook member 6 advances through the outlet guide passageway 8 and through the heddle eye 2 and further extends beyond the inlet guide passageway 5 of the inlet guide member 3 to hook the warp thread WT on the hooked end 7 thereof. When the warp thread WT is hooked on the hooked end 7 of the hook member 6, the hook member 6 is caused to move axially in the opposite direction through the inlet guide passageway 5 and through the heddle eye 2 and further through the outlet guide passageway 8. As noted above, since the warp thread WT is gripped loosely by the first warp chuck 9 and closely by the second warp chuck 10, the warp thread WT hooked on the hooked end 7 is withdrawn from the first warp chuck 9 and passed through the inlet guide passageway 5, the heddle eye 2 and the outlet guide passageway 8 by the axial rearward movement of the hook member 6. After passed through the outlet guide passageway 8, the warp thread WT is closely gripped, as shown in Fig. 6 A , by means of a take up chuck 11 positioned in the vicinity of the outlet side of the outlet guide member 4. The inlet guide member 3 is then axially moved away from the heddle 1 and the upper and lower parts 3a and 3b thereof are separated in the directions indicated by arrows in Fig. 6 A . At the same time, the outlet guide member 4 is axially moved away from the heddle 1 and the upper and lower parts 4a and 4b thereof are separated in the directions indicated by arrows in Fig. 6 A . After separations of the inlet and outlet guide members 3 and 4, the warp thread WT passed through the heddle eye 2 is taken out by lateral movements of the second warp chuck 10, the heddle 1 and the take up chuck 11 in the directions indicated by arrows in Fig. 6 B . In the presently used warp threading apparatus, however, there have been drawbacks which result from the fact that the warp thread is passed through the heddle eye by means of the hook member having a vertical thin flat portion. The first drawback is that the hook member may fail to pass through the heddle eye by the fact that the heddle eye is standardized and that the hook member to be inserted into the standardized eye can not be reduced in cross sectional dimensions since the vertical thin flat portion of the hook member is limited in mechanical strength. The second drawback is that the hook member can not be rapidly passed through the heddle eye due to the limitation in mechanical strength, resulting in decrease in speed of passing the warp thread through the heddle. It is possible at present that the passing the warp thread through the heddle is twice per second. In this instance, the maximum acceleration of the hook member has been reached up between 30 gravities and 40 gravities to reciprocate a stroke of 600 mm. The third drawback is that the warp thread is subject to cut since the warp thread is passed through the heddle by the thin hook member. Even if the speed of the hook member were increased, the warp thread would readily be subject to cut due to the increased speed. The fourth drawback is that the process cost of the inlet and outlet guide members is expensive since the inlet and outlet guide passageways in the inlet and outlet guide members are required to be formed highly precisely. The operational mechanism of the guide members is further intricated since the inlet and outlet guide passageways of the inlet and outlet guide members are required to be positioned highly accurately. It is, accordingly, an important object of the present invention to provide a method and an apparatus for passing a warp thread through the heddle eye by vaccum suction without having recourse to the use of the thin hook member. It is another important object of the present invention to enhance the speed at which the warp thread is passed through the heddle eye. It is another important object of the present invention to effectively prevent the warp thread from being cut during the operation. The drawbacks of a prior art warp threading apparatus and the features and advantages of an apparatus in accordance with the present invention will be more clearly understood from the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which Referring now to the drawings and more specifically to Fig. 8, there is shown a preferred embodiment of an apparatus for passing a warp thread through a heddle eye in a heddle in accordance with the present invention. The apparatus comprises a warp beam 22 having a plurality of warp threads WT wound thereon, warp thread supply means 20 adapted to take out one by one the warp thread WT from the warp beam 22 and transfer the warp thread WT to a predetermined position Referring to Fig. 8, there is shown the warp thread supply means 20 comprising warp guide tubes 34 and 36 arranged in the upper portion of a generally L shaped frame structure 38, a separation suction nozzle 40, a warp chuck 42 and a warp cutter 44. The generally L shaped frame structure 38 is constituted by a front upstanding frame 46 having a front surface 48 extending in parallel to the traverse longitudinal axis of the warp beam 22, a base frame 50 extending from the lower portion of the front upstanding frame 46 and a rear upstanding frame 52 extending upwardly from the rear portion of the base frame 50. Several thousands of warp threads WT wound on the warp beam 22 are first tensioned through tension rollers 54, 56 and 58 by means of a weight member 60. These warp threads WT are arranged transversely in a row along the front surface 48 of the front upstanding frame 46 as shown in Fig. 10. The warp beam 22 is movable transversely with respect to the front surface 48 by suitable drive means not shown provided in the L shaped frame structure 38. As shown in Fig. 11, two pieces of warp strings 62 and 64 extending transversely along the front surface 48 of the front upstanding frame 46 are passed through the warp threads in such a manner that each of the warp threads WT is held by the warp strings 62 and 64. The warp threads WT arranged in a row in the transverse direction are thus prevented from being entangled with one another. The warp strings 62 and 64 are passed through the warp guide tubes 34 and 36, respectively. The warp guide tubes 34 and 36 are movable toward and away from each other so that the warp thread WT is released from the warp strings 62 and 64 which are moved away from each other by the warp guide tubes 34 and 36. The warp thread WT released from the warp strings 62 and 64 is separated from the remainder of the warp threads WT by means of the separation suction nozzle 40. As shown in Figs. 8 and 10, the warp chuck 42 forming part of the warp thread supply means 20 is provided at one end of a pivotal arm 66. The pivotal arm 66 is pivotably mounted at the other end thereof on a pivot pin 68 which extends substantially horizontally laterally from the side face of the front upstanding frame 46 of the L shaped frame structure 38. The pivotal arm 66 is thus pivotable about the pivot pin 68 between an upward position indicated by solid lines in Fig. 8 and a downward position indicated by phantom lines in Fig. 8 with respect to the L shaped frame structure 38. As shown in Figs. 13, 14 and 15, on the one end of the pivotal arm 66 is securely supported a bearing 70 in which a chuck shaft 72 is rotatably received. On one end of the chuck shaft 72 is mounted a support block 74 having rotatable pins 76 and 78 rotatably received therein. Generally H shaped chuck members designated by nemerals 80 and 82 of the warp chuck 42 are securely mounted on the rotatable pins 76 and 78, respectively, and adapted to grip the warp thread WT at two positions as shown in Figs. 10 and 14. The rotatable pin 76 further has a gear 84 mounted on the axial end thereof. Likewise, the rotatable pin 78 has mounted thereon a gear 86 which is in meshing engagement with the gear 84. Thus, the chuck members 80 and 82 of the warp chuck 42 are rotatable about the rotatable pins 76 and 78 between an open position indicated by phantom lines in Fig. 13 and a closed position indicated by solid lines in Fig. 13 in response to rotation of the gears 84. A tension spring designated by numeral 88 is provided between a fixed pin 90 mounted in the chuck member 80 and a fixed pin 92 mounted in the support block 74 to hold the chuck members 80 and 82 of warp chuck 42 in the open and closed positions. The chuck members 80 and 82 are rotated into the open and closed positions by movement of a projection 94 mounted on the chuck member 80. When gripping the wrap thread WT, the chuck members 80 and 82 are rotated into the closed position by engagement of the projection 94 with the flange portion of a member 96 Fig. 12 mounted on the piston rod of an air cylinder 98 which in turn is securely mounted through brackets on the upper surface of the front upstanding frame 46 of the L shaped frame structure 38. On the other hand, when releasing the warp thread WT, the chuck members 80 and 82 are rotated into the open position by engagement of the projection 94 with a stop member not shown provided in the vicinity of the predetermined position Referring again to Figs. 8 and 9, there is shown the heddle supply means 24 adapted to take out the heddles 26 one by one from the heddle magazine 30 and transfer the heddle 26 to the predetermined position Referring to Figs. 16 A and 16 B , there are shown a warp guide nozzle generally indicated by numeral 116 and a warp suction nozzle generally indicated by numeral 118 which form part of the warp suction means 32. The warp guide nozzle 116 is adapted to guide to the heddle 26 the warp thread WT supplied by the warp chuck 42 of the warp thread supply means 20. The warp suction nozzle 118 is adapted to pass the warp thread WT through the heddle eye 28 by vaccum suction. The heddle 26 is interposed at the predetermined position The method for passing the warp thread through the heddle eye and the operation of the apparatus therefor will now be described in detail in conjunction with Figs. 17 A and 17 B to 21 A and 21 B . The heddle 26 is first gripped at the upper and lower ends thereof and taken out from the heddle magazine 30 by the take up heddle chucks 106 and 108 of the heddle supply means 24. The take up heddle chucks 106 and 108 with the heddle 25 gripped thereby are caused to turn in the predetermined direction so that the warp thread WT is passed through the heddle eye 28. The take up heddle chucks 106 and 108 are then transferred in the predetermined position In the embodiment of the present invention described hereinbefore, the speed at which the warp thread is passed through the heddle eye is remarkably enhanced since the threading is done by vaccum suction without having recourse to the presently used hook member. In accordance with our experimental results, flow speed of 83 m sec is obtained under vacuum of 500 mmHg or 0.667 bar. In this instance, if the ratio of the speed of the warp thread to the flow speed is 0.5, the speed of the warp thread of 41.5 m sec is obtained. Accordingly, the time of passing through a guide passageway of 600 mm is 0.014 sec. Thus, the speed of the threading is remarkably enhanced as compared with the speed of 0.12 sec obtained by the use of the hook member. It will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art that the present invention has general utility as a means for passing a warp thread through a heddle eye in a heddle.
