# Substituted acyl derivatives of 1,2,3,4 tetrahydroisoquinoline 3 carboxylic acids, salts thereof, pharmaceutical compositions containing the derivatives or salts, and the production of the same.

## Abstract
There are disclosed substituted acyl derivatives of 1,2,3,4 tetrahydroisoquinoline 3 carboxylic acids having the following general formula The substituted acyl derivatives of 1,2,3,4 tetrahydro isoquinoline 3 carboxylic acids and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof may be produced by coupling a suitably substituted 1,2,3,4 tetrahydroisoquinoline with a suitably substituted amino acid and, when desired, hydro lysing or removing the protecting groups of the resulting product. The compounds of the invention, their salts and pharmaceutical. compositions thereof are useful as anti hypertensive agents.
