# Enzyme immunofluorescent assay for anti Epstein Barr virus antibodies.

## Abstract
A method for the determination of anti Epstein Barr Vi rus antibodies in a test sample comprises contacting a sub strate for the anti Epstein Barr Virus antibodies with sam ple treating the contacted substrate with labeled antihuman Ig antibody selected from a a mixture comprising enzyme labeled antihuman Ig antibody and fluorescent labeled anti human Ig antibody, b antihuman Ig antibodies labeled with an enzyme and a fluorescent label, c fluorescent labeled antihuman Ig antibody to which enzyme labeled antibody against the animal species from which the antibody used in the fluorescent labeled antibody was derived is subse quently added, and d enzyme labeled antihuman Ig anti body to which fluorescent labeled antibody against the ani mal species from which the antibody used in the enzyme la beled antibody was derived is subsequently added deter mining the enzyme activity of the treated substrate and de termining the immunofluorescent patterns in substrates ex hibiting enzyme activity. The method is useful for the rapid screening for anti Epstein Barr Virus antibodies for the diagnosis of Infectious Mononucleosis.
