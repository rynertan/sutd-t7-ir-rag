# Filtration of a coal liquid slurry using an alkylmethacrylate copolymer and an alcohol.

## Abstract
The rate of filtration of coal liquid slurry is increased by adding an alkylmethacrylate copolymer and an alcohol containing 2 to 10 carbon atoms to the slurry prior to filtration or by adding the alcohol to the slurry and washing a precoat cake of filter aid with an oil solution of an alkylmethacrylate copolymer prior to filtration. Although the alkylmethacrylate copolymer and the alcohol each provide a filter rate improving effect when used alone, a synergistic improvement in filtration rate is achieved by their combined use.
