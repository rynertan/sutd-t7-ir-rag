# Electron gun for color picture tubes.

## Abstract
An electron gun for a color picture tube has been generators 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 for generating three electron beams and directing them toward the fluorescent screen along three paths 15, 16, 17 which are parallel with each other on the same plane, and at least one pair of electrode surfaces 111, 121 each having three apertures 112, 122 centered with the three paths for forming independent main lenses so as to focus the electron beams on the fluorescent screen, the electrode surfaces 111, 121 being spaced apart from each other. Provided for the electrode surface are cylindrical shield members 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32 centered with the apertures and extending from the apertures in opposition to the opposing electrode surface. Outer ones 27, 29, 30, 32 of the cylindrical shield members have each an end surface inclined with respect to the center axis of the aperture so as to form inclined electric fields effective to converge the outer beams to one point to which the central beam converges.
