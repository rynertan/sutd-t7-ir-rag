# Vibration noise reduction device for electrical apparatus.

## Abstract
A vibration noise reducing device for applying vi bration noise reducing vibrations sound waves of sub stantially opposite phase to vibrations noises generated from an electrical apparatus is disclosed, in which the vibrations noises from the electrical apparatus is sensed by a sensor 12, 70 , the sensed analog time domain signal 14 is A D converted, the resulting digital time domain signal 18 is then Fourier transformed, the re sulting Fourier transformed digital frequency domain sig nal 22 is modified in its amplitude phase to produce a second digital frequency domain signal 26 for ge nerating a vibration noise reducing control signal, the second digital frequency domain signal 26 is inverse Fourier transformed, the resulting inverse Fourier trans formed second digital time domain signal 30 is D A converted, and the resulting analog time domain signal 34 is used as the control signal to generate the vibra tion noise reducing vibrations sound waves to be ap plied to the virbrations noises.
