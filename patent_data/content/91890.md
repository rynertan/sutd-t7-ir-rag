# Apparatus for recovering heat and ventilating a room space.

## Abstract
Heat accumulators 1 in which the outgoing air releases its heat and from which the incoming air picks up heat are connected by one end with the exhaust duct 2 and intake duct 3 of the room space, the direction of flow in these ducts 2, 3 being the same all the time under control by a flap 4 , and the opposite ends of the heat accumulators being connected to the fresh air intake duct 5 and the outgoing exhaust duct 6 , the direction of flow being the same in these latter ducts 5, 6 all the time under control by another flap 7 . The heat accumulators 1 consist of elements which may be added or taken off two and two, in accordance with the required capacity of the apparatus, and that the intake and exhaust ducts 2, 5 carried to the room spaces can correspondingly in a manner known in itself be lengthened or shortened by means of branch pieces.
