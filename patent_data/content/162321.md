# High speed image recording apparatus for energy subtraction processing.

## Abstract
A high speed image recording apparatus comprises a sheet changer for changing a stimulable phosphor sheet at an image recording position, a radiation source drive con troller, and a filter changer for changing a radiation filter on a radiation passage between a radiation source and a sti mulable phosphor sheet at each image recording step. The sheet changer, the radiation source drive controller and the filter changer are activated by signals sent from a controller to load the stimulable phosphor sheet to the image recording position, to change over the radiation filter, and then to emit a radiation to the stimulable phosphor sheet via an object, thereby recording a high energy image and a low energy image of good energy discrimination in stimulable phosphor sheets.
