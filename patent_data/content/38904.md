# Process for producing a hot dip galvanized steel strip.

## Abstract
A hot dip galvanized steel strip in which the zinc based alloy coating exhibits a satisfactory appearance and is firmly fixed to the strip substrate is produced by a process which comprises coating at least one surface of a steel strip 1 with a melted zinc based alloy 4 controlling the weight of the melted zinc based alloy coating and solidifying the melted zinc based alloy coating, which process is characterized in that the zinc based alloy contains 0.1 to 2.0 by weight of mag nesium and in at least a portion of the stage in which the melted zinc based alloy coating is still in the fluidal state, the zinc based alloy coating is exposed to an oxygen controlled atmosphere containing 1000 ppm or less of molecular oxygen, the controlling procedure for the weight of the melted zinc based alloy coating being carried out in the oxygen controlled atmosphere.
