# Process for preparing polycarbonate type surfactants from ethylene carbonate and a monohydroxy alcohol.

## Abstract
A process for preparing polycarbonate type nonionic surfactant compositions comprising monohydroxy alcohols capped with polycarbonate groups. The surfactant com positions comprise aliphatic, nonaromatic cycloaliphatic or aromatic alcohols which have been capped with block poly carbonate groups formed by the reaction of the alcohols with ethylene carbonate in the presence of an alkali metal salt catalyst. The surfactant properties are varied by first reacting the alcohols with ethylene oxide to form a block polyether group cap on the alcohols before the reaction with ethylene carbonate or by further reacting the polycarbonate capped alcohols with ethylene oxide to form a terminal polyether block group. The surfactants are formed by react ing 2 20 moles ethylene carbonate and 3 50 moles ethylene oxide per mole of the alcohols.

## Description
PROCESS FOR PREPARING POLYCARBONATE TYPE SURFACTANTS FROM ETHYLENE CARBONATE AND A MONOHYDROXY ALCOHOL This invention relates to methods for making nonionic surfactants, with particular reference to making nonionic surfactant compositions comprising monohydroxy alcohols capped with a polycarbonate. In many industrial and household cleaning applications it is desirable or necessary to use a surfactant in the cleaning formulations to achieve satisfactory wetting and cleansing. Furthermore, in many of these industrial and household applications it is necessary to maintain a low level of foam during the cleaning operation. For example, surfactants that produce excessive foaming may be unsuitable in an industrial spray metal cleaning operation or for use as an active ingredient in detergents and rinse aids for household mechanical dishwashers. One type of nonionic surfactant known in the art is the fatty acid ester of an alcohol ethoxylate, which ester is produced by condensing ethylene oxide with a detergent range alcohol, and then reacting such ethoxylated alcohol with fatty acids containing from 8 to 18 carbon atoms, or with the chlorides of such acids. Surfactants produced in this manner are described in U.S. Patent 1,970,578 which teaches such surfactants as having excellent wetting, foaming and cleansing properties. However, surfactants of this type would not be satisfactory for uses where the suppression of foam is important. Another type of nonionic surfactant known in the art is described in Japanese Patent Publication 56 106,919 which teaches a nonionic surfactant composition prepared in a manner similar to the method of this application. However, the final products are inferior as foam suppressing agents. The present invention is a process for the preparation of a polycarbonate type surfactant comprising reacting ethylene carbonate and a monohydroxy alcohol in the presence of an alkali metal salt catalyst at a temperature of 1300C to 2100C. The present invention is also directed to a process wherein said surfactant is reacted with ethylene oxide in the amount of 3 to 50 moles of oxide per mole of surfactant. More specifically, the surfactant compositions prepared by the process of the present invention comprise compounds represented by the following structural formulas EMI2.1 EMI3.1 where R is an aliphatic, non aromatic cycloaliphatic or aromatic group, y is a number from 1 to 10 and x is a number from 3 to 50. The monohydroxy alcohol may be capped with ethylene oxide before reacting it with ethylene carbonate or the reaction product of the ethylene carbonate monohydroxy alcohol reaction may be further reacted with ethylene oxide to provide surfactants having different physical properties. The hydroxyethylation reaction of the alcohol or polycarbonate reaction product with ethylene oxide can be easily accomplished by using a basic catalyst, i.e.,KOH, at a temperature of about 900C to about 1200C. The reaction of the monohydroxy alcohol or ethoxylated alcohol with ethylene carbonate is represented by the following equations.EMI3.2 The above equations illustrate that 50 percent of the available CO2 in the ethylene carbonate is lost as a result of the formation of the carbonate intermediate illustrated by the first equation. Thus, the theoretical maximum yield of the polycarbonate block portion in the surfactant compositions is only 50 percent of the CO2 available in the original ethylene carbonate reactant.Moreover, it is believed that the ethylene carbonate alcohol reaction is initiated by an ethoxy ether radical resulting from the decomposition of ethylene carbonate to ethylene oxide and CO2. This ethoxy ether free radical initiation of the polycarbonate alcohol reaction appears to be accurate since only about 38 percent to 43 percent of the CO2 in the ethylene carbonate is normally retained as a carbonate radical in the final surfactant compositions. Generally, about 2 to 20 moles, and more preferably about 3 to 10 moles, of ethylene carbonate per mole of monohydroxy alcohol or ethoxylated monohydroxy alcohol are reacted together to provide the hydrophobic properties in the final surfactant compositions. Also, about 3 to 50 moles, and preferably about 3 to 10 moles, of ethylene oxide per mole of monohydroxy alcohol or polycarbonate capped monohydroxy alcohol are reacted together to provide the hydrophilic properties in the final surfactant compositions. The temperature of the ethylene carbonate alcohol reaction is maintained between about 1300C to about 2100C, and preferably between about 1400C and about 1700C. A reaction temperature below 1300C is not desirable since the formation of the polycarbonate block portion of the surfactant compositions is extremely slow at such low temperatures. Reaction temperatures above about 2100C are also undesirable since ethylene carbonate will decompose into ethylene oxide and CO2 at these elevated temperatures and the more reactive hydroxyethylation or polyether reactions will occur. In order to form the polycarbonate block portion of the surfactant compositions, it is necessary that the ethylene carbonate alcohol reaction be run in the presence of an alkali metal salt catalyst. Examples of useful alkali metal salt catalyst are sodium stannate, potassium stannate, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, the sodium alkoxide of the monohydroxy alcohol and the potassium alkoxide of the monohydroxy alcohol. Sodium stannate has been found to be a particularly effective catalyst since high yields and low reaction time were obtained when it was used. In view of the preceding discussion, it will be appreciated that the polycarbonate type surfactant products produced by this invention have, in all probability, some random ether radicals disposed within the polycarbonate block portion of the products since the theoretical 50 percent CO2 retention in the products is normally not achieved during the ethylene carbonate alcohol reaction. Furthermore, it will be appreciated that the surfactant products are not a single compound in each instance, but are a mixture of compounds of different molecular weights characterized by an average molecular weight depending on the termination point of the ether and or carbonate blocks in each molecule. The following examples illustrate the preparation of the polycarbonate type surfactants in accordance with the present invention.Example 1 A stirred reaction mixture of 2640 grams 30 moles of ethylene carbonate, 558 grams 3 moles of n dodecanol and 12.0 grams 0.056 mole of sodium stannate was heated to 1700C for 24 hours in a reaction vessel under a nitrogen atmosphere.
