# Hook disengaging apparatus.

## Abstract
The apparatus including a hook 12 pivoted on pin 16 below its hooking point 20 between a pair of plates 14, and having a cam locking structure 32, 30. The force applied to the hook by the pull of the item being held causes the cam sur faces to jam and keep the hook closed but, when the force applied to the hook falls below a predetermined value, a counterweight 70 rotates the cam structure 56 away from the hook and allows opening rotation anticlockwise of the hook. The counterweight is further used to positively pull the hook to the open position after a given amount of travel via a lanyard 80, 24. Additionally a locking pin structure 74 may be provided to prevent the automatic disengagement occurring and a spring biased reset via lanyard 28 may also be provided.
