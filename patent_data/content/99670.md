# Forming and handling sectioned products.

## Abstract
A process for handling edible products, comprising laying down a length of edible product on to a takeoff conveyor 1,2,3 and cutting the length into sections, char acterised by the use of a line of successive travelling turntables 4,5,6,7 along and on which the length is laid, and by cutting the length into sections between the turntables in a manner which allows relative separation by rotation of the cut sections, and by rotating each turntable 4,5,6,7 carrying a cut section through a defined angle, thereby to present a cut end of the section substantially transversely of the line of the conveyor.
