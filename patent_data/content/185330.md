# MULTI SAMPLE LIQUID HANDLING SYSTEM

## Abstract
A multi sample liquid handling system 10 performs multiple essays on each of a plurality of samples. The system includes a table 16 for supporting one or more multi well trays 18,20,22 and a vertically shiftable head assembly 24 mounted above the table 16 and carrying a row of fixed position pipettes 60 for dispensing assay liquid simultaneously into a row of wells in a tray. The table 16 is horizontally shiftable, along a path extending in a front to back direction, to position a selected row of tray wells below the pipettes 60 . Also included in the system 10 is a rotatable sample holder 26 mounted for rotation adjacent one side of the table 16 . A sample transfer pipette 34 mounted on the head assembly 24 is shiftable in a side to side direction for transferring successive samples in the holder 26 to each of a group of wells in a row of a tray 18,20,22 . The system 10 has an optical sensor 100 for sensing the liquid level in each sample tube 28,30,32 to allow sample withdrawal at predetermined levels within the individual sample tubes 28,30,32 .
