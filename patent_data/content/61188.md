# Process for operating a fluidized bed.

## Abstract
In a process for operating a fluidized bed, wherein the bed particles have a Reynolds number of less than 20, at a predetermined cryogenic temperature comprising i bring ing a cryogenic fluid into indirect contact with the bed ii permitting the fluid to vaporize at the area of indirect contact whereby the bed is cooled and iii utilizing the vapor from step ii to fluidize, and further cool, the bed, said cooling in steps ii or iii being from ambient temperature to the predetermined cryogenic temperature, the improvement comprising changing, continuously or stepwise, the mini mum fluidizing mass flow of vapor as the temperature of the bed changes in accordance with a specified equation.
