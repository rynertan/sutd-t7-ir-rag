## Description
SOAP BARS A wide variety of toilet soap bars and methods of making such soaps are known in the art. See, for example,U.S. Patent 2,686,761, Ferguson et al., issued August 17, 1954, and U.S. Patent2,970,116, Telly et al., issued January 31, 1961, both of which are incorporated herein by reference.In general, it is desirable in such soap bars, especially in soaps which have a luxury or skin care image, to utilize a formula which, in use, gives relatively large amounts of lather, both for cleaning effectiveness and support of the desired image. Water soluble salts of N substituted amino acids have been used in detergent compositions and soap bars slime soap or curd dispersants. See, for example, U.S. Patent 3,536,628, published October 27, 1970, French Patent 1,317,586, published January 2t 1963,. and British Specification 745,367, published February 22, 1956, all of which are incorporated herein by reference. It has been taught that when such substituted amino acids are included in soap bars, it is necessary to use relatively high levels e.g., at least about 7 in order to get the desired curd dispersing effect.It has now been found that the incorporation of low levels of N substituted amino acids and their water soluble salts in soap bars provides those bars with increased in use lathering performance. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a soap bar which exhibits enhanced in use lather formation. It is a further object of the present invention to provide an additive which may be used in soap bars at low levels to obtain increased lather formation. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is a soap bar which comprises, as a lather booster, from about 0.5 to about 6 of an N substituted amino acid, or the water soluble salt thereof, said acid having the formula R1R2N CH, ,COOH wherein R is a C10 C20 aliphatic hydrocarbon radical, R is hydrogen, CH2 XCOOH , or a C1 C5 aliphatic hydrocarbon radical, and x is 1 or 2. As used herein, percentages, ratios and parts are by weight and are based on the composition of the finished soap bar unless otherwise specified. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The soap bars of the present invention comprise, as a lather booster, from about 0.5 to about 68, preferably from about 1 to about 5 , and most preferably from about 1.5 to about 4 , of an N substituted amino acid, or the water soluble 12 salt of such an acid, said acid having the formula RlR2N CH2 xCOOH wherein R1 is a C10 C20 aliphatic hydrocarbon radical, preferably a C10 C20 alkyl group and most preferably a coconut alkyl group R2 is hydrogen, a CH2 xCOOH group, or a C1 C5 aliphatic hydrocarbon radical, and is preferably hydrogen and x is 1 or 2. Mixtures of these lather boosters are also useful in the present invention. It is preferred that the substituted amino acids be used in their acid form or in the form of their sodium or potassium salts. When x is 1, the lather booster is an N substituted glycine and when x is 2, the lather booster is an N substituted beta alanine. The N mono substituted compounds i.e., those in whichR2 is hydrogen are preferred. Good results, however, may be obtained with compounds in which R2 is a lower aliphatic hydrocarbon radical, for example, N methyl N dodecyl glycine, or a moiety having the formula CH2 xCOOH R2 must not be of such a carbon chain length or configuration as to inhibit the water solubility or surface activity of the amino acid, a requirement which is usually met by hydrocarbon radicals having no more than about 5 carbon atoms. It has been found that the N monoalkyl beta alanines i.e., those in which x is 2 and R2 is hydrogen are particularly suitable for use in the present invention. An example of such an alanine salt is obtained by adding methyl acrylate to a mixture of primary amines obtained from the mixture of fatty acids found in coconut or palm kernel oil, and neutralizing the product so obtained with a caustic soda solution.Particularly preferred beta alanines of this type are those in which R1 is derived from coconut oil. Commercially available compounds of the N substituted amino acid type include the Amphorams, sold by Soeiete Pierrefitte Auby, and the Deriphats, sold by General MillsChemicals, Inc. These compounds are described in more detail in the commercial bulletin num 15A, Deriphats , published in 1972 by General Mills Chemicals, Inc., incorporated herein by reference. Specific examples of such compounds include N coconut beta amino propionic acid N lauryl, myristyl C12 Cl4 beta amino propionic acid N tallow betaiminodipropionic acid N lauryl beta imidodipropionic acid and the complete and partial sodium, potassium and triethanolamine salts of these acids. An alanine salt, useful in the present invention, may be prepared in the following manner 85 kg. of a mixture of primary amines obtained from the mixture of fatty acids found in coconut oil are cooled below 250C. 36 kg. of methyl acrylate are then added to the mixture of amines at such a rate that the temperature remains below 250C with the aid of water cooling. After all the methyl acrylate has been added, the reaction mixture is stirred for four hours while keeping its temperature at 25 300C. 47.5 kg. of this intermediate product are added, with constant stirring, to 77 kg. of a 10 caustic soda solution at a temperature of 500C. The addition is carried out over a one hour period.The product so obtained is a free flowing paste which contains approximately 30 of the sodium salt of N coconut beta alanine. The soap bars of the present invention also contain a soap component. This component is generally present in an amount of from about 40 to about 95 , preferably from about 55 to about 85 , of the finished soap product. Soaps useful in the present invention include the alkali metal, ammonium and alkanolamine salts of fatty acids containing from about 8 to 24, preferably from 10 to 20, carbon atoms.Fatty acids suitable for use herein can be obtained from natural sources, such as plant or animal esters e.g., palm kernel oil, coconut oil, babassu oil, soybean oil, castor oil, tallow, whale or fish oils, grease, lard and mixtures thereof. The fatty acids can also be synthetically prepared e.g., by the oxidation of petroleum or by the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide by the Fischer Tropsch process. Resin acids, such as those present in tall oil, may be used.Naphthenic acids are also suitable. Sodium and potassium soaps can be made by direct saponification of fats and oils or by the neutralization of free fatty acids which are prepared in a separate manufacturing process. Particularly useful in the present invention are the sodium and potassium salts of mixtures of fatty acids derived from coconut oil and tallow, i.e., sodium and potassium tallow and coconut soaps. The term tallow is used herein to define fatty acid mixtures having an approximate carbon chain length distribution of 2.5 C14, 29 C6, 238 C18, 2 palmitoleic, 41.5 oleic and 3 linoleic acids the first three fatty acids listed being saturated . Other mixtures with similar distri butions, such as fatty acids .derived from various animal tallows and lard, are a Iso included within the term tallow. The term coconut , as used herein, refers to fatty acid mixtures having an approximate carbon chain length distribution of 8 C8, 7 C10, 48 C12, 17 C141 8 C161 2 C18, 7 oleic and 2 linoleic acids the first six fatty acids listed being saturated . Other sources having similar carbon chain length distributions, such as palm kernel oil and babassu kernel oil, are included within the term coconut.Coconut fatty acids generally have a sufficiently low content of unsaturated fatty acids to have satisfactory keeping qualities without further treatment. Generally, however, the fatty acids are hydrogenated to decrease the amount of unsaturation especially polyunsaturation in the fatty acid mixture. In preferred soap bars, the soap component comprises from about 20 to 80 of a mixture containing soaps having from 8 to 14 carbon atoms and from 20 to 80 of soaps having from about 16 to 20 carbon atoms. Soaps having such preferred chain length distributions can be obtained by using mixtures of tallow and coconut fatty acids in tallow coconut weight ratios between 90 10 and 50 50, more preferably between about 80 20 and 60 40. Preferred soap bars containing these soap mixtures, as well as their methods of manufacture, are described in U.S. Patent 3,576,749, Megson et al., issuedApril 27, 1971, UOS. Patent 3,835,058, White, issued September 10, 1974, andU.S. Patent 3,988,255, Seiden, issuedOctober 26, 1976, all of which are incorporated herein by reference. The soap bars of the present invention inevitably contain some moisture this is required for the optimum soap bar processing conditions. Generally, the finished soap bars include from about 4 to about 25 , preferably from about 10 to 23 , by weight, of moisture. In addition to the components described above, the soap bars of the present invention can contain a wide variety of optional materials. These materials include, for example, skin conditioning components, free fatty acids, processing aids, anti bacterial agents and sanitizers, dyes, perfumes and coloring agents. The soap bars of the present invention can optionally contain free fatty acids, in addition to the neutralized fatty acids which form the actual soap component. Free fatty acids improve the volume and the quality of the lather formed by the bar. These acids tend to cause the lather to be more stable, containing smaller air bubbles, which give, the user a lather which is characterized as richer and creamier. In addition, in soap bars which contain large amounts of salt, the free fatty acid component acts as a plasticizer. Without the free fatty acids, some bars have a greater tendency to form wet cracks. Free fatty acids useful in the present invention include the same types of fatty acids used to form the soap component.Such fatty acids generally contain from 8 to 22, preferably from 8 to 14, carbon atoms In preferred soap bars at least about 25 of the free fatty acid component is C12 fatty acid. If present, free fatty acid generally comprises from about 1 to about 15 by weight of the bar. Use of free fatty acid in soap bars is described in more detail inU.S. Patent 3,576,749, Megson et al., issued April 27, 1971, and U.S. Patent 3,835,058, White, issued September 10, 1974, both of which are incorporated herein by reference. Materials to facilitate the preparation of the soap bars can also be present. Thus, sodium chloride and, preferably, glycerine, for example, can be added to the crutcher or amalgamator in order to facilitate processing of the bars. Such materials, if present, generally comprise from about 0.2 to about 10 by weight of the finished soap bar.Additionally, emulsifiers, such as polyglycerol esters e.g. polyglycerol monostearate , propylene glycol esters and other chemically stable nonionic materials may be added to the bars to help solubilize various components, particu larly skin conditioning agents, such as sorbitan esters. Conventional anti bacterial agents and sanitizers can be added to the soap bars of the present invention without adversely affecting their lather properties. Typical antibacterial sanitizers include those described in U.S. Patent 3,256,200, Reller et al., issued June 14, 1966, incorporated herein by reference. If present, anti bacterial agents and sanitizers generally comprise from about 0.5 to about 4 by weight of the finished soap bar. The soap bars of the present invention may also optionally contain various emollients and skin conditioning agents.Materials of this type include, for example, sorbitan esters, such as those described in U.S. Patent 3,988,255, Seiden, issued October 26, 1976, incorporated herein by reference, lanolin, cold cream, mineral oil, isopropyl myristate, and similar materials. If present, such emollients and skin conditioning agents generally comprise from about 0.5 to about 5 by weight of the soap bar. The soap bars can also contain any of the conventional perfumes, dyes and coloring agents generally utilized in soap bars to improve the characteristics of such products.If present, such perfumes, dyes and coloring agents comprise from about 0.2 to about 5 by weight of the soap bar. The soap bars of the present invention may be opaque or transparent and are prepared in any conventional manner.For example, moisture containing base soap of the type described above is admixed with the substituted amino acid, or its salt, and other optional components, such as perfumes, in a crutcher or amalgamator, milled in a conventional manner under conventional conditions and extruded into logs for stamping into soap bars. Conventional processes for preparing transparent soap bars can also be utilized. The present invention is particularly applicable to transparent soap bars, since the high tallow coconut ratio soaps i.e., 90 10 to 60 40 useful in such bars tend to exhibit decreased lather. Manufacturing processes for preparing soap bars of the type claimed herein are described in detail in U.S.Patent 3,835,058, White, issued September 10, 1974, U.S.Patent 3,576,749, Megson et al., issued April 27, 1971, and U.S. Patent 3,523,909, Bradley et al., issued August 11, 1970, all of which are incorporated herein by reference. The soap bars of the present invention, their benefits in terms of improved lather characteristics and their utility in conventional hand and body washing operations are illustrated by the following non limiting examples. EXAMPLE I Soap bars, having the compositions described below, were used to test the lathering properties of the bars of the present invention. WEIGHT m EBCRENCE 65 35 Tallow Coconut Soap mixed sodium potassium 72.80Free Fatty Acid 2.00Glycerine 5.95Moisture and Minors Balance to 100 In addition to the above REFERENCE soap bar, soap bars were also made by adding sodium N coconut beta alanine sodium N coconut beta aminopropionate, Deriphat 151, commercially available from General Mills Chemicals to REFERENCE soap noodles, not containing the free fatty acid component, in the amalgamator at levels so that the final soap bars contained 1.6, 3.2 and 7 of the Deriphat material. The noodles were then processed in a roll mill and extruded through a plodder to form soap billets which were stamped to form the soap bars tested. The REFERENCE and REFERENCE 1.6 Deriphat bars tested weighed about 150 grams each, while the REFERENCE 3.6 Deriphat and REFERENCE 7 Deriphat bars weighed about 30 grams each. The tester thoroughly pre washed his hands to remove all grease and dirt and then filled a sink with 250C city water, having a hardness of about 2.2 mmoles liter. Each soap bar was then rubbed down for a one minute period under the water. After the one minute soaking period, each bar was revolved in the tester s hands four times under water and three times out of the water. After putting the bar down, the tester then worked up a lather by rubbing his hands together 10 times. The suds were then gathered in the.palms of the hands and scraped off into a 400 ml. beaker.The procedure was repeated four times per soap bar by at least two testers and the average soap volume for the soap bar was calculated. The volume obtained for each composition was compared to that obtained with a commercially available 50 50 tallow coconut soap and is expressed below as a percentage of the volume obtained with the commerciallyavailable 50 50 soap. The results are summarized in the table below. Comnosition Lather VolumeREFERENCE 65REFERENCE 1.6 Deriphat 70 pEFT RCCcE 3.2 Deriphat 75 REFERENZE 7 Deriphat 65 These data indicate that the inclusion of low levels of the Deriphat material resulted in a clear increase in the lather volume produced by the soap bars. Further, the data indicate that such benefits were not obtained when high levels, such as those taught in the prior art, of the Deriphat material were included in the soap bars. Substantially similar results are obtained where a soap bar of the present invention includes the Deriphat material at a level of about 0.75 , 1.25 , 2 , 2.75 , 3.5 , 4 , 5 or 6 . Similar results are also obtained where the Deriphat material used in the example above is replaced, in whole or in part, by sodium or potassium N methyl N dodecyl glycine, potassium N coconut beta aminopropionate, sodium or potassiumN lauryl, myristyl C12 Cl4 beta aminopropionate, di sodium or di potassium N tallow beta iminodipropionate, the partial sodium or potassium salt of N lauryl beta iminodipropionic acid, the triethanolamine salt of N lauryl, myristyl C12C14 beta iminopropionic acid, the acid forms of the foregoing compounds, or mixtures thereof. EXAMPLE II The compositions described in the table below exemplify various embodiments of the present invention. These soap bars may be manufactured in any of the conventional ways known in the art, particularly those described in the present application. It is to be appreciated that similar compositions may be made by substituting sodium or potassiumN methyl N dodecyl glycine, potassium N codonut beta aminopropionate, sodium or potassium N lauryl, myristyl C12 Cl4 beta aminopropionate, di sodium or di potassium N tallow beta iminodipropionate, the partial sodium or potassium salt of N lauryl beta iminodipropionic acid, the triethanolamine salt of N lauryl, myristyl C12 Cl4 beta iminopropionic acid, the acid forms of any of the foregoing compounds, or mixtures of these compounds, in whole or in part, for the sodium N coconut beta aminopropionate lather booster, specified below.Component Weight EMI10.1 tb SEP Composition tb SEP A SEP A SEP SEP B SEP C SEP D SEP E SEP F SEP G SEP H SEP SEP I tb Sodium SEP tallcwate SEP 55.1 SEP 59.6 SEP 47.1 SEP 68.0 SEP 31.5 SEP 49.7 SEP 42.4 SEP 46.5 SEP SEP 4U.2 SEP tb Sodium SEP cocoate SEP 13.8 SEP 14.8 SEP 11.8 SEP 15.0 SEP 31.5 SEP 22.6 SEP 22.8 SEP 38.0 SEP 10.1 tb Potassium SEP tallowate SEP 6.1 SEP SEP SEP 8.3 SEP SEP SEP 7.0 SEP SEP SEP 4.7 SEP SEP .
