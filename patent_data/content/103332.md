# Process and composition for coating a metallic substrate with a polymeric film.

## Abstract
There is disclosed the coating of a metallic substrate with a cross linked polymeric film by contacting the sub strate with an aqueous composition containing at least an acrylic or metacrylic compound which can be defined by the general formula A metallic substrate coated by the composition of po lymeric nature as described above ist than heated to a tem perature equal to, or lower than 180 C approximately and for the time which is necessary to originate a polymeric film cross linked upon said substrate. A film so deposited exhibits optimum properties as to adherence, resistance to bending and shocks and resis tance to the saline mist.
