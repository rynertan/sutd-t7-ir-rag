## Description
Electro acoustical converter The present invention relates to an electro acoustical converter with a closed vibration space, one wall of which is formed by a vibrating plate consisting of a metallic diaphragm clamped at its peripheral edge, on which diaphragm is fixed a disk made of a piezo electric material.Such an electro acoustical converter is well known in engineering and the invention has in view to provide a suchlike converter with a nearly flat sound intensity frequency characteristic in the range of the lower frequencies from about 800Hz to about 4000 Hz.According to the invention, this objective is attained through the fact that this vibrating plate is acoustically coupled with an acoustical filter which is formed by at least two successive chambers that are communicating via at least one first aperture in an intermediate wall, the first of these chambers of this vibration space being separated by this vibrating plate and the second of these chambers communicating with the ambient air via at least one second aperture in an outside wall.The acoustical filter ameliorates the acoustical adaption between the vibration space and ambient air, whereby the aforesaid lower frequency range is reproduced more strongly and about uniformly. At the same time, the reproduction of the higher frequency range is weakened.The invention will be described hereinafter, reference being made to the attached drawings, wherein figure 1 shows a schematical longitudinal section of an electro acoustical converter according to the invention, the relative dimensions of the components and distances between these components, however, not having their real values figure 2 shows an equivalent electric diagram of the acoustical filter AF of figure 1.This converter comprises a cylindrical housing B with a dia meters and length L and provided with a vibration space TR with the length L1 and with an acoustical filter AF, acoustically coupled therewith, with the length L2 L3. This filter comprises two successive chambers K1 and K2 with the respective lengths L2 and L3. The ratiosEMI2.1 are respectively comprised between 4 and 10 10 and 60 and 9 and 30.The vibration chamber TR is completely closed and separated from the filter chamber K1 by a vibrating plate TP. This vibrating plate TP consists of a circular metal diaphragm M which at its circumferential edge is fixed to the housing B and which, in its central zone, is firmly assembled, for instance by means of glue, with a circular disk S which is made of a piezo electric material, for instance piezo electric ceramics. The disk S is connected with two electric connecting cables E1 and E2. The metal of this diaphragm has a modulus of elasticity comprised between 6,5.103 N mm and 210.103 3N mm2 and its density is comprised between 1,5.103 kg m and 3 kg 3 m kg m .The thickness of this diaphragm M is comprised between 0,5 and 1,2 times the thickness of the disk S and the diameter of this disk is comprised between 0,3 and 0,9 times the diameter of the diaphragm M.The filter chamber K with a volume V1 communicates with the filter chamber K2 with a volume V2 via a circular aperture 1 with a diameter D1 in a intermediate wall TW with a tickness dl, the product d1 .D1 being comprised between 2 mm2 and 12 mm2.The filter chamber K2 communicates with the ambient air via a multiplicity of circular apertures as are O2 and O3, in the outer wall BW with a tickness dl. These apertures have respectively diameters D2 and D3 and the product of the sum of the diameters of all the apertures, that is to say D2 D3 ..., and the thickness d2 is comprised between 10 mm2 and 20 mm . The intermediate wall TW and outer wall BW are both made of a vibration damping plastic material, for instance polyamide, in order that these walls should not form parasitary sources of vibration.Due to the presence of the closed vibration space, the sound intensity frequency characteristic is being ameliorated. As a matter of fact, due to this, the own frequency of the mechanical system is being heightened. The frequency range extending between the first and second resonance frequencies of the vibrating plate TP is, however, being reproduced too weakly.Through the application of the acoustical filter AF, this drawback is being suppressed, because this filter extending within the frequency band that extends between the aforesaid first and second frequencies has an impedance transforming action, whereby the adaption between the vibrating plate and air becomes ameliorated. Furthermore, this filter acts as a low pass filter, the tipping over frequency being chosen so that the higher frequency band is being strongly weakened.This is a consequence of the values chosen of the aforesaid ratiosEMI3.1 thicknesses dl and d2 and products D1.d1 and D2 D3 ... .d2.The equivalent electric diagram of the acoustical filter is shown in figure 2 and comprises the capacity CK1 and self induction LK1 due to the chamber K1 the capacity CK2, self induction LK2 and resistance RK of the apertures as are 02 and 03.in the wall of BW the radiation resistance Z.the values of CK1, CK2, LK1, LK2 and RK are given by the following formulas, if one supposes that the outside wall BW is provided with n apertures with a radius a2 and the intermediate wall is provided with one aperture with a radius al. The radius al of the aperture 1 in the intermediate wall TW is chosen so great that the resistance of this aperture may be so low as to be neglected.EMI4.1 p density of the air y 1,4 for air p static pressure 0 X 2 f with f frequency cinematic viscosity coefficient of air 1,56 x 10 5 mê a1 radius aperture in TW a2 radius aperture in BWV1 volume of chamber K1V2 volume of chamber K2 d1 thickness of wall TW d2 thickness of wall BWRK resistance of holes in BW 02 03 etc. n number of holes in BW.
